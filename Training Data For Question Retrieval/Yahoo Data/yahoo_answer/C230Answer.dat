rMNWd17saa	First, drink lots of water, being dehydrated will bring on false contractions.  Take a warm relaxing shower, if they are not the real thing this will make them stop.  If these 2 things don't stop the contractions then it is really labor.  Grab a pen and paper kick back with a good book or pop in a movie.  Be sure you have a clock in sight with a second hand.      Start timing them.    1. When a contraction begins note the time.  2. When a contraction ends note the time.  3. The difference in these numbers is how long the contractions are lasting.  4. Note the time the next contraction begins.  5. The distance from the first contraction to the second contraction is how far apart your contractions are.  6. Time a few contractions to check for regularity.     True Labor        * Contractions do get closer together.      * Contractions do get stronger.      * Contractions tend to be felt all over.      * Contractions do last longer.      * Walking makes the contractions stronger.       When your contractions are consistently 5 minutes apart and each one lasts for 60 seconds it is time to call your doctor.  They will then tell you to go to hospital and they will meet you there shortly after.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think I did both, at least in the very beginning. But sitting on the computer while you're in labor is probably not a good way to manage pain; getting up and walking around is a good idea. Have someone else write them down for you, if need be.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I would time them myself|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I just time them myself, keep track in a journal if you want... go to the hospital when they are long and very frequent.|`|4LPINXoUaa	time them your self that way you know for sure hun
VR9KhbEgaa	I feel your pain....my 14 month old does this and laughs like crazy! I always give my son a baby spoon and fork with his dinner. He sometimes will use it and other times it goes straight into the floor, along with the plate and food!  I am now back to only putting a few pieces of food on his tray at a time. Luckily his high chair has wheels, so I just roll him over to the sink while I start doing the dishes. His new favorite place to wipe his hands is on the wall next to his high chair! My son also rips the bib off right away and will almost choke himself trying to get it off if I try to use the kind you pull over their head! So he now eats dinner in his diaper and socks! I know he will get over this soon, but yes it will drive you crazy for a few months!|`|XHFj2IVhaa	You'll find that children go through all sorts of phases, as mine continue to do, and my oldest is going on 8..!    At her age, she's learning that she can get your attention. Your dish-doing while she's eating has begun to disagree with her, and she wants you to cater to her, even if it IS negatively. Consider this another milestone...    Come to terms with the fact that she's no longer an infant, but a toddler. The "Terrible Two's" actually start at age 1, and last until about age 4.. You've only just begun to get a taste of just how "bad" things can get..!      This is another phase, and one in which both of you will have to learn yourselves through. In the meantime, try to keep dinnertime a time of eating and not playing nor arguing. Do your best to train her mind into learning the value of sitting down to eat. It'll take time, but before you know it you'll be past this stage, and into another (ugh..)    Good luck, and i'm glad THOSE days are behind me..!|`|44OH7Si6aa	Strip her down and let her eat in nothing but a diaper and clean her up with baby wipes. If her hair is long enough put it in a pony tail on top of her head that should keep her from getting too much in the hair.

When you do the dishes, pull up a chair and let her "help".  My daughter is doing the same, and sitting with her helps a lot.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	My daughter is almost 13 months, and yep- she does the same thing!  LOVES to drop food on the floor, doesn't like to be spoonfed.  Grubby hands straight to the hair!  I feel like just taking the food from her and assuming she's not hungry, but I know she really IS hungry and just wants to play.  She loves to squish things into her high chair tray, too!  I'm hoping this phase passes quickly!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	I was just going to ask this question...My daughter is also 14 months old and is acting this exact same way....I feel like she is going to go hungry because she eats practally nothing...everything I try to give her she will not eat and knocks the spoon out of my hand and she will not eat with a spoon herself at all...and she also hates her bib....as for the bath maybe try those throw away washclothes with the soap already in them to wash just her hair and then rinse with another clean washcloth...good luck I am so happy that my little sweet girl isn't the only one acting like this...I hope it is short lived...LOL|`|sAhAEC2qaa	spank her|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Yeah its tough sometimes they eat a ton and other times nothing. I would maybe feed her things that arent so messy. My son is 2 and still finds it easier to eat with his fingers than his fork. Feed her items like grilled cheese and crackers. Some of those gerber puffy things. Cherios or fruit loops. Just remember everything is new for her. To save your sanity I would feed her food that doesnt make her messy. Avoid sauces maybe you could do buttered noodles? Good luck it gets better.French fries...just some other suggestions.|`|vI0WnAiOaa	welcome to mummyhood. lol. no seriously all kids go though this. if you are trying to do something else while she eats then stop and sit down with her and eat too. i still go as far as spoon feeding my nearly 2 year old other wise she wouldnt eat much at all.  if the bath is drying her skin just have water, no soap in the bath, she will be fine.  it will get better, and like someone said, put less in front of her to start with and only serve food that is good for fingers.  oh and if she has a favorite food that she wants to eat all the time then thats fine as in a few days that will change too. so if she just wants say peas, just give peas, etc

Did you have staples, or did they use the dissolving suters?     I have seen staples cause issues like this, that is why in the Hospital I had my son in, did not use them on abdominal surgeries.    My brother had surgery on his bowels, and for 3 months afterward he was getting infections and he had seroma, at least 2 times. His incision was black.     I don\t know what the usual treatment is for it, but he had his drained.
5k0FKWTSaa	Infection in your blood stream is called septicaemia, and it is potentially life threatening to you and baby. You'd feel really unwell. And will need hospitalisation for antibiotics (given intravenously - through the veins).    Infections can get into the blood from ANYWHERE in your body really!  It can be from a wound on your skin, an infection in your kidneys/urine, and yes... even from your tooth.     If you do not feel well, or feel feverish, see your OBGYN for a checkup.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Most infections won't affect your baby,just you. But if you're worried,ask your doctor about the specific infection you are worried about.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You need to go to the dr ASAP. It could very much harm your baby.

Easiest is making tacos.  Lay out all the ingredients out on the table and get creative.    Making a cake.  Have each child do  a part along with you.  Each child can break an egg assisted. Licking the spoon and the bowl duties are the best for little ones!    There are sites that have really great options.  Kids will enjoy it more if you find yourself lost in the fun as well.

kVBDpAMTaa	That was my first sign of being pregnant was sore breasts. I noticed a few days before my period and I never even had sore breasts before my period before. I thought that there was something wrong with me. The more days that passed the more sore that became. I got really crampy right near my period and waited and waited for my period but I never got it. I just got a lot of "period like" cramps. After 5 days of my expected period I decided to take a test because I still had not started my period and to my surprise it was POSITIVE.     Anytime you have sex there is the chance of pregnancy, so sorry but your husband is wrong. My mother got pregnant while using birth control and so did my friend. And I got pregnant using condom. So, no protection is 100%, not even getting tubes tied or vasectomy, you could ask your doctor and they will tell you the same thing.    Hope this helps!    Also, you should take a test on the day of your expected period, that is when tests are most accurate.|`|AA11763588	It seems a little early for that to be happening, but everyone is different.    Keep in mind that some symptoms of pregnancy are the same as before you start your period.
rMNWd17saa	I know this must be a very hard choice for you to make, especially since you have given birth to 2 children already.  But really consider this before you make a permanent decision on a temporary situation.  Many women who have abortions regret it for the rest of their lives.  Especially those who have experienced pregnancy and childbirth previously.  You know that you are ending your child's life before it even has a chance.  Look into your baby's eyes and really think long and hard.  Isn't this baby worth 9 months of being uncomfortable, even a little crazy?  Talk to your husband.  Talk to your Doctor, they may be able to give you something to help you deal with the stress.  It is much better to take meds for anxiety while pregnant than to abort the baby altogether.  Remember, things will get better and it will get easier as the children get a little older.  If you can just hang in there for a few more months.  Then after this baby is born get the IUD inserted.  It is wonderful, it's like having tubes tied (don't have to think about it for 5-10 yrs) unless you want to get pg, then have it removed.  What I hope you do is get on anxiety meds to get through this pg and have baby.  If you still don't think you can handle raising the 3rd baby, there are so many people out there who cannot have children who would love your baby.  Please give your baby a chance.    Another idea, if you do decide to give baby up for adoption, maybe you could choose and meet the adoptive parents while you are still pg, I'm sure they would like to be there for you and give emotional support during your pregnancy, maybe even babysit your other 2 for a few hours so you can relax.  Good luck in your decision.  God bless you and your family!|`|f2ae56134c701bec40583a856d15ba10aa	Oh, sweetie you are gonna get some serious haters. I'm so sorry.  It sounds like you are really having a difficult time right now. Terminating your pregnancy is completely and totally your right, for whatever reason. If you can't handle this, then you can't handle this. You have to do what you feel is best, period end of story. I would recommend looking at a more reliable method of birth control, while you are at your appt. I hope for the very best for you, regardless of your decision. Best of luck.|`|DD5CMWfkaa	I think you are being unreasonable, even in your situation. Honestly, you are 22 with two children, you know the consequences of sex, and what it brings. If you didn't want a child you should have taken proper measures beforehand to prevent it, the child doesn't deserve to die just because you are wanting to be selfish...|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	If you think you can't do it. give him/her up for adoption. In my opinion. It's a much better thing to do.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Yes, you are being unreasonable.    Especially since you have had 14 weeks to decide, and the longer you leave it, the worse it actually is.    It's hard to keep an open mind when someone refuses birth control, keeps getting pregnant, and asks a forum forum of strangers what she should do.    How about stop making babies?    You it's not fair to take a child's life, just because "It doesn't tie in with your schedule"  Maybe you should have thought about that BEFORE you had sex.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Have you talked to your fiance about this? He should get a say in the matter for one. Two..just because it would be more convenient for you doesn't make it right. I don't necessarily mean that harshly but that is how you make it sound. You know how to prevent pregnancy but you chose not to unless you just didn't say that part of the story so no I don't think you should get one. Adoption is just one of your options. Think about it.    She wouldn't have asked it here and told us that abortion is horrible if she didn't want to hear that she shouldn't do it. She feels guilty if she has to ask and since she did we have the right to say no. If you don't like it i'm sorry.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	I don't think you are being unreasonable.

Only you can make this decision you are the one that has to raise this child you cant have anyone judge you because you believe it will be to much I would prefer you to end this pregnancy as a precaution than become one of these mothers that get to over whelmed and take out on there kids. You need to sit down and go through your head and decide if you can deal with terminating this pregnancy or if you can handle another baby.

Chastising this woman is the absolute last thing she needs right now. Please stop. Also, for the record...she has a 10 month old and was probably breast feeding, lactating women generally do not get pregnant (of course there are always exceptions)    In answer to your question, I think that you need to do what is right for yourself, and only you can determine what the correct course of action is. I would advise you to speak with a non-judgemental counselor if you need help. You are not being unreasonable. You are overwhelmed and scared. Termination is certainly an option which is your choice to make, but there are others. You are thinking about your children you have now, who certainly do not need a mother who is stressed out and having panic attacks (not that it is your fault as you are under an extreme amount of stress)    Call Planned Parenthood, they generally have medical professionals for you to speak with who will advise you of your options and oint you in the direction of a good counselor.     Good Luck.|`|gtTIILgyaa	I think you will regret it at a later point. It seems like a quick fix, but since you already have two, why not one more. Yes, it will be ahrd.

My husband was in the marines and we only saw each other every couple months. 2 weeks before my first born was born my mother died. 3 months later i was pregnant again and i was seriously considering an abortion. I had way too much stress of losing my mother, my husband was about to be deployed, and ongoing another pregnancy. I also had mini panic attacks because of everything that happened in the past year. I was 19 when i gave birth to my 2nd child. Now im pregnant with our third 5 months after our 2nd baby was born. I know how it can feel like way too much but just remember how you felt when your other children were born! But if you feel like its the best decision then you go with your gut!

Abortion is horrible, and if you know that then you will probably regret having one.|`|0VUZacRTaa	I definetly think that you should have prevented this before it happened, especially bc you know all the options and know your situation. You need to own up. Dont take away this childs chance for life selfishly. If you dont want another kid, so be it, there are plenty of nice families that CANT have kids and would love to have a baby. Put it up for adoption and own up to your mistakes. While your pregnant get help from friends and family. And im sorry your fiance is leaving, but maybe its best for now so you wont get pregnant again after this pregnancy right away. Good luck, and please do the right thing.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Give it up for adoption. There are SOOO many people out there that CANT have babies.. and then there are the fertile lucky ones (you and me)..... Personally I know it would be hard to carry it and then give it up, but you would be giving the baby the best life and the parents the best gift ever. Also... four months pregnant.... The baby is already there... you really would be killing a human.. how selfish of you. You should have done it sooner if you were going to abort. But it seems as if your mind is already made up because you have the apt and all... sooo... more power to ya, You'll only regret it.|`|24P6A0oaaa	you know, with your situation you do have a lot! if you did get an abortion, don't let other people let you feel bad, the only thing I don't like is how far along you are...BUT I WAS going to get an abortion at 13 weeks but decided not to, but if I did then I would have been just like you. I just didnt do it because I feel like I can, hopefully, handle it...the only difference is you have one more kid than I do... I'm 21 with a 2 year old and 22 weeks pregnant.   so.... do what you need to do    edit: not sure if you will read over this again but I understand how you feel when you dont  want to go through the abortion but you feel like it would be the best decision. If you need someone to talk to you can email me at kadensmommy0204@yahoo.com|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	I want you to get on Youtube and watch a video called Silent Scream. I saw it this morning for the first time and I have been crying all day. It shows to abortion of a 12 week fetus. I have two kids 4 and 6 months. I know it's overwhelming, but consider adoption. I don't understand why everyone is so quick to abort when there are couples everywhere just waiting for a baby to adopt. Please watch this video it will change you entire thinking about abortions. It was enough to alter my entire view of the world and people in general.|`|qgJLZPDJaa	i, amoungst others, would gladly take in an "unwanted" child. dont do it. ive had an abortion and its the worst mistake a human being can make. im soo thankful to be able to have the chance to be pregnant again.  youll make it, girl. youre just hormonal.   my pregnancy isnt an ideal situation either..but im going to make it work :)|`|Tp3jOpc7aa	You know the answer to your question better than anyone here. They don't know what its like to be in your shoes. They have no idea what your feeling. Only you know that. There is no reason why you should even be asking people on here who have no idea who you are and didn't even know you existed until you asked this question. Chances are a question like this is going to be answered mostly by people who are going to tell you not to do it. You probably figured that already because pro-choice people don't try to force the choice of abortion on you like the pro-life people push keeping the baby.    My answer to you is that you already know the answer whether it be abort or keep it, and I would not take these answers by complete strangers as a way to choose such a major turn in YOUR life. its not theirs and they seem to forget that|`|R9AAhsIjaa	How wonderful would it be to give your sweet baby the gift of life? To give the baby a chance at life with a couple who can't conceive on their own. Someone who will provide for the baby in every aspect of her life. Sure it's rough going through the pregnancy, but how awesome would it be to know you made such a big sacrifice for another human being? You may feel better knowing you showed one of the most selfless acts a mother can show to her child.     It is your decision, but it sounds as though you've already developed feelings for the baby because you aren't sure if you want to terminate. I wish you the best of luck and peace of mind in whatever you choose to do. I'll also gently say, in years to come, it might be wise to try to avoid this situation before it happens. I know it's easier said than done, but concentrating on the children you have and the career you're working towards and of course, your upcoming wedding, you might want to think about methods to avoid pregnancy. Maybe even long-term control like Mirena. I don't want to come across preachy, I sincerely wish you the best in your decisions and endeavors.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i think you waited way to long to make this decision 14 weeks is a long time they say any more then 8  is pushing it . on that note..... only you  can make the decision . and the chances of dieing from birth control are less than dieing from an abortion so think about it .|`|AuVtUjVAaa	I don't think you should have an abortion. Its wrong to kill a human being. There's always adoption. I'm sure a family that can't have kids would love to have a newborn baby. Seriously, think it over again.............|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Sounds like you are having doubts about whether this is the right thing. If that's the case then I doubt you keep that appt. I understand your situation, you are definetely overwhelmed but you are also a strong woman to handle what you already do and you should be proud of yourself. To be honest, you say "I know abortion is horrible" and you have to realize that if you feel this way about abortion then you are going to be the type to regret it if you go through with it. Don't put yourself through that.|`|mLbydsVIaa	aww...im srry about your situation.. :(  abortion is horrible and it will make you feel wayyy worse...just adopt. you wont feel as bad. or you can have the baby and give it to someone you know and when your ready for it raise it then. i really hope you dont abort...it will make you feel so bad and make school way worse to deal with than if you stayed preggo.the hormones and stuff are worth it in the end and im sure ppl will work with you on it and youll get theough school. please keep it... you wont regret it and things will work out in time and fall into place.  i just dont want you to make a decision you will regret and will hurt you the rest of your life... :(  please...adopt. if you abort you will never know who the child could of been and how things would of went...at least give it a try...and by the time the baby is due you can decide to adopt or keep it.  but i really think you have the heart to love another and put up with it...it will just bring more joy to your life...more joy than difficulties.  things will work out..just please keep it  god bless and hope this helped :)|`|FeMJDEcIaa	Forget all those rude people. They are only on here to pass judgement.  You should not feel bad for taking control of your life and making the decisions that are only going to effect you.   None of them have any right to tell you what you should or should not do.    If having an abortion is the best solution for you right now, then I would go ahead with it.  Alot of places have counseling if you think you'll have a hard time.    But you have two beautiful healthy children, it's time that you focus some attention on yourself.  I know I dont know you but I am proud of you, at least you are mature enough to recognize that this is a step you need to take in life.|`|uERNKwOYaa	stop having sex or be SMART and use a contraceptive.|`|acxDJIQtaa	You are definitly being unreasonable. Thats an innocent childs life you will be taken away. You shouldve thought about all that b4 u got pregnant again. && you already ahve 2 kids so its not like ur a new mom or anything. Abortions are definitly never okay for any situation because no matter what you can always find a way to make it work.|`|grDtMCcDaa	No you're not being unreasonable. In your head your thinking that you can't handle being pregnant right now and that you wouldn't be able to take care of the baby like you know it deserves, because of work and your other kids.    It's up to you. Its YOUR decision. If you truly dont think you could handle the baby then maybe its the right decision. But I've had an abortion before. I was pregnant at 19 and I thought that me and my husband couldn't handle having a kid, im too young, I still have to go to school, etc etc. I thought it was the right thing to do at the time... but afterwards I regretted it. I became highly depressed because I realized that I was just selfish and ruined a chance of having a kid. Now everytime I even see a baby I get choked up because of a decision I thought was right for me.    Do whatever you feel is right, but just think about it long and hard. Not just what it could do for your career or you becoming stressed and anxious, but how your gonna feel after its done and you cant take it back.|`|SnyDa8Claa	Only you can answer this question. If you were to read this, what would you think? Let me break it down for you    1. have 2 children under 3  2. have gone back to school  3. Fiance leaving for the the navy.    Now consider this.   1. If your fiance was staying and not leaving, would you have the baby  2. Can you live with yourself afterward.  3. We can all have busy lives. If you sit and reflect, is that really an issue?  4. If you cannot mentally/emotionally/financially take care of a baby, would you take pride in giving someone a gift of a baby?    If you can answer these questions, and still think an abortion is right.. then that is the right choice for you.    I am pro-choice. But I also don't think it should be used as a form of birth control. If you decide to terminate, get yourself on some form of BC.     Good luck, I hope you find your answer.  Take care.|`|COUk2iCOaa	4 months pregnant? && now @ this point, && this far along, you have just decided to get an abortion?! Im deff. against abortion, adoption?! If you cant handle another kid, then put it up for adoption! A qoute of hope... "God will not give you what you cant handle."|`|g7pqKw5Qaa	i know the situation seems tough but i know you have some kind of support team maybe a mom or sister some friends yeah having 3 three kids and trying to go back to school is hard but do you think you can live with the facts or knowing how innocent babied are and killing them. if you already have anxiety and panic attacks believe if you decide to abort its one of the most depressing things for at least 3 months will you be to deal with that is the question|`|AA11121225	It is your decision. Only you know what you are going thru. Only you can decide whether or not you can handle another child. And only you can decide whether or not your conscience will allow an abortion. One thing is certain, you will not forget doing it.     I do not agree with people who say women who have abortions are haunted all their lives. But I do think that a situation like you are describing (that looks hopeless to you right at this moment) has other solutions which are better.    Perhaps you can un-enroll in school for now and take time for your children. Marry the dad and just be a mom for several years. Those children will all--including the one unborn--be in school in about five years. In five years you will be 27 years old. You have lots of time to go to school. But you can't put kids on hold. You already have two that need a mom--NOT a baby-sitter every day. What difference, really, would one more make? They will be about a year and a half apart. How could a year and a half make that much difference to you.    As for pregnancy affecting you this way or that:  It's only a few months out of your lifetime. And you have a lot of control over how you allow it to affect you. Don't kid yourself into believing that you don't!  Eat right, exercise, change the way you think.    Look at what a lovely family you can have. Let the career or whatever wait a couple years. You won't be sorry.|`|YTOrDW3haa	well being a little personal here but i got pregnant when i was 18 and i got an abortion. i have a 5 month old daughter now but i still think about those twins that were taken from me and my stupidity. i think about them everyday. i believe in choice but i regret it everyday and i thank god for my miracle because they said that i probably wouldnt ever get pregnant again because of my abortion. think about it. hard.   i know it must be hard but honey get on some birth control! lol!
irLnPW4aaa	IF you are collecting benefits from the state, then YES you need to do the DNA test because it is not fair for the taxpayers to have to pay to support your child while the father gets off without paying for his own child.       I suppose that if you don't have the DNA test done then they will suspend any benefits that you may be receiving.  That seems fair to me.     If you are not currently getting benefits and don't want to get them in the future, then I guess you probably don' t 'need' the DNA test.  When they call you to reschedule it, then ask them WHY they want you to do this.|`|TQW5E6olaa	1. You are taking money from the state, you have to follow their rules or they can refuse you further benefits  2. If he hurt you to the point where you needed stitches in the private region, that's a felony assault, I'm thinking they would have had to call the police, you should have filed a report, it would help you limit his visitation if you fell he's a threat.  3. Boyfriends aren't husbands, even then there's no guarantee he'll stick around, get the support.|`|sxecXFgraa	Why didn't you go to the police about the rape?  Now, it's just he said/she said.  If you are on welfare, then yes, the state can force you to have a maternity test.  They're giving you money for food via food stamps and the child support money can offset the amount the state gives you.  He signed the birth certificate so in the eyes of the courts, he is the father and should be supporting the child.  Regardless of your feelings toward the father and believing you don't need the child support, every child deserves to have a relationship with their father.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	There has got to be a reason, why the State of Tennessee is making you file for Child Support.    He may be the scum of the earth.  But, By not getting the DNA test, you could be held in contempt of court.|`|HyknHVV5aa	This "man" or lets call him a boy, is not a good person in any way....but he should not get off free. He should be aware their are consequences to his actions, such as having a child and leaving. If I were you file for sole custody, file a police report of abuse and rape and file for a restraining order, and file for child support. He will have to pay child support until the child is 18, and trust me as the child gets older and needs more things, you will appreciate the extra money. Do the DNA test, you will regret it down the road if you don't.|`|CEMUpgFPaa	please you want him to be in your childs life.. you dont want a child growing up w/o a father if you can avoid it. If your that worried get supervised visits.. I couldn't agree more with the first two posters. he doesn't "make much" anyways??? So your going to let him get off the hook? Child support amounts go by what is earned! Even if he pays 20$ it is the right thing to do and it buys your baby diapers..So ther is NO EXUSE    Edit: To others, she said after I had my son I had stitches btw.. I believe she is talking about during her childbirth she tore and needed stitches, I got stitches myself also because I had a 3rd degree tear and a 10 pound son. (no fun)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Yes, your son has to participate in a paternity test.If not, the state cannot collect.    You not wanting child support benefits has nothing to do with it.You were on government assistance and they want their money back.That's just how it is.    How do you know he will start coming around?  Why didn't you file a police report if he "raped" you?      He is the father and entitled to his rights (one reason why you should have filed for a police report) His family also deserves to know their Grandchild/nephew and your son deserves to know them.      Needless to say, you need to get the DNA test done.If he wasn't in the child's life before or made a attempt to be in your son's life, he might not even want visitation rights in the first place.      Good luck with it all.|`|28WJwHf4aa	If you are living off the system, then you need child support. Let the birth father support him instead of the tax-payers.    Your 'new' boyfriend isn't guaranteed to be in your child's life.    Avoiding the DNA test will only make your ex want it more as he's going to begin to think he's not really the father.    If you don't want him in your son's life, seek a cease of parental rights from him.     In the end though, it's not your decision. If he's the father, he has every right to be in his son's life.|`|shBj5RElaa	first of all if hes a horrible person than why did you have a kid with him.    2nd of all, if YOU dont do a dna test it brings doubt to wether the kid is hhis, what are you trying to hide ?    and why didnt you file rape charges ? now there's a rapist out there, Im sure the people of tennessee will thank you for that    do the dna test unless you have something to hide|`|GahMjygBaa	if he doesnt have a job all u have to do is fill out the child support paper thy give u n make sure u tell them that n they should dismiss it all until he gets a job n can actually pay|`|AA11523807	Number 1 you should have filed a policCe report when he raped you, Specially with the damage that was done because of it. Second, The state will cut you offf if you dont actively pursue the child support. THe point of Food stamps welfare, medicaide etc is to TEMPERARILY get help. Not for you to depend on the rest of your life. The state will want the biological father to be responcible and help with the child financially, so its not all on them.
aZwaCKgdaa	Every child is different.  At 2 1/2 months, it isn't that uncommon for some babies not to pick their heads up while on their tummy.  It involves muscles not only in their little necks, but also their core.  Some babies master the skill earlier than others.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Well all babies are different and they'll be able to hold their head longer at their own pace.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	she will do it when she is ready too..she is only 2 and half months...give her alittle bit more time....|`|GahMjygBaa	some babies arent as strong as others...you will see the difference when she gets use to using her neck|`|ddP3klT3aa	She will just have to practice. All babies are different. She just needs to make sure she gets plenty of supervised tummy time during the day. She shouldn't keep her on her stomache for hours. I would say 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off for an hour in the morning and an hour at night. But that is up to her. Don't annoy your daughter with suggestions. :)|`|AA11865529	Holding the head up for prolonged period doesn't happen until four months. Don't worry. Putting the baby on the stomach is the way to help her develop those neck muscles. And don't push baby.|`|vt76wtBcaa	she just needs more floor time/ belly time, the more she is on her belly the more her neck will get stronger. i have 3 babies and my 3rd was lazy and hated being on her belly. she couldnt lay there with a controlled head-up unti 3 months or more.
GGH0HVdvaa	Yep. It's called ATTITUDE. All teens go through it much to the chagrin of their parents. you eventually grow out of it though.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	I'm a hell of a lot older than you and i still think things are stupid.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	yes that is absolutely 100% normal/ordinary/typical.  it is a phase and you will grow out of it.|`|7gntdi0uaa	Yeah , sure.

Sorry, I'm a little out of it right now, lack of sleep haha|`|W0jhffBfaa	yes.  My sister's 14 and she thinks everythings stupid (esp. our parents) and it annoyes the HELL out of me!

Im 16, and will be 17  in march!|`|H90uflbFaa	yes, im the same way haha im 14 btw|`|sdcx2clBaa	Wow, i do the exact same thing, i turned 15 in september too.

I would have that attitude too if I walked around in Abercrombie and Fitch all day :)|`|6pEDLnrzaa	when people ask the most dumb questions ever like that they get on your nerves|`|02zIFfOIaa	When my daughter was 15 she got pissed off at everything I said to her , or any question I asked her.  She thought it was all stupid.  The problem is you are just very self centered right now, and thats normal for your age.  If you try to take a sincere interest in other people you wouldn't think everything is stupid.  Get over yourself and you will find a whole wonderful interesting world out there that is not in the least bit STUPID.|`|XwrjRj52aa	haha what? I think that you're just having trouble describing parts of your life because you have a limited vocabulary. :) But no offense, it happens to us all.|`|PBO836YBaa	hay, im 15 and my birthday is in september too :)    And yes, its normal i feel that way too.     but my bff does call me emo though lol    But im a very happy person
heC9aQ18aa	I vote for the first one Aislyn Esme. It looks more like a genuine name. The others looked like someone trying to make the name more unique by messing with it and changing the spelling.

5k0FKWTSaa	We will require more information. Such as how many weeks are you now, and when was this diagnosed - how many weeks gestation were you?     Any bleeding? Any pain?    The earlier you are in the pregnancy, on scanning, the placenta might look like it's low and in the position of your CS scar. As your pregnancy progresses, chances are, your placenta will be pulled upwards and away from the scar area.     There is a small chance of the placenta being stuck to the scar tissue, and that can cause bleeding and pain. And if it gets stuck after delivery, can cause major bleeding. However, it's not a very common occurance.  If you are having a repeat CS this time around, your OBGYN will look out and prepare for this potential problem, as all good surgeons should.|`|f2ae56134c701bec40583a856d15ba10aa	Whats your question? That is a pretty common occurrence.
qsjGSXaRaa	I'm with you on this one. I'm constantly amazed at how many women on this site will ask questions about whether or not they can give a particular medication (most often it's about Tylenol) and what dosage they should give to their baby. It's hard to imagine that they would take the advice of anyone on this site and go forth and actually administer it to their baby just because someone on Yahoo Answers told them it's okay to do because they've done it....totally negligent and irresponsible, if you ask me. I've been thumbs-downed before because I let someone know I thought it was irresponsible so I fully expect it will happen again. Bottom line: it's a completely crazy and UNSAFE thing to do.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I never hesitate to take my daughter to the doctor but sometimes I come on here and ask people what they think just to compare situations.|`|fTikGzRjaa	They don't have health insurance??  It's called MEDICAID!|`|2MKvrydWaa	i agree it's o.k 2 ask about something small like what is everyones favorite brand of diapers or where is the best place to do baby  shopping.but if they say thier baby has a serious rash on thier back,pus coming out thier eyes,or a horrible cough then that is nothing to ask yahoo b/c we can't be docs.i understand that they may want to c if someone else had that experience but sometimes it's just best to go to the doc or web.md:-)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i wonder the same thing all the time...i guess they don't know that docs have an after hours answering service or they are afraid they will be calling and seem ignorant.....maybe they worry that the er won't see them unless they can pay up front...i really dont' know ,but as a nurse, i just think it's crazy...no way would i ask medical advice from a bunch of ppl online; i am going to call the person who's getting paid to answer or take her straight to the er if i feel it is urgent.....|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I do think that part of the problem is that, at least in the US, some mom's don't have health insurance.  It's horrible, but true.  So they have the same anxious problems as the rest of us, but they fret about whether or not to take the baby in, because if it's nothing, it will cost a lot of money.  If I freak out and take the baby in for nothing, it costs me a 10 dollar co-pay.  If they do, it could be several hundred dollars in an ER visit to be told that he's colicky, or teething.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i agree, my baby isnt born yet but when/if i think i have a problem with my pregnancy or anything i get on here and look at the previously asked questions for about 2 minutes to see if i can find an answer or to see if what im feeling is normal, if i am still not at ease i call my doctor and if im really worried in the mean time [while waiting for a call back] i will ask a question stating that i am waiting for her to call back but i want opinions/advise      EDIT: and to the person above me...it is totally free to CALL a doctors office and ask to speak with a nurse, and the nurse can and will have you talk to the doctor if she cannot help you. how do i know this for a fact? i worked as a medical receptionist at a SPECIALIST doctors office all through HS. Also, would you rather pay a ER room bill or have your child die because of your lack of proper medical attention? Theres not an excuse for a child to not have medical insurance ANYWAYS....there is ALWAYS medicaid and if you make too much money to get it but too little to pay for your family to have insurance AT LEAST INSURE YOUR KIDS WITH A LOW COVERAGE MED INSURANCE. DUH|`|JLayHNZCaa	Drs. won't generally talk to you on the phone, nurses can't tell you what to do, not everyone has universal health care, they cannot afford to take their child to the Dr. every time the wind changes, they are bored and are seeing if anyone on YA has any sense at all, they don't really have children.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I have my pediatrician's number on speed-dial!

I'm not sure why a mom would want advice from complete strangers regarding a very serious health issue...very perplexing...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That person that annoyed you was a troll; and now she or he has gotten what he/she wants -more attention.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Some people don't have medical.    EDIT: I make too muchmoney for state medical BUT I can not afford medical, there is this funky place in earnings where people like me are in. EVERYTHING for my kids' medical comes out of pocket.    Oh, and insurances will not take my daughter because she has a pre existing condition. It happens. And the DR's AND the hospitals do not have on call nurses, I tried calling one time and they say, "take her in, we can not give advice over the phone."|`|KMcUHkpgaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!  man youre a dick, its called  NO HEALTH INSURANCE!!!!  and they havent heard about webmd.com|`|dwdLkvgPaa	I dont either...I would never take advice about something that important from someone I don't even know....I wouldn't waste my time asking on here if I thought my baby was sick enought to be brought to the ER I would be on my way...|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	You are absolutely right and people do it often in the pets section too.    "My dog has had diarreah for seven straight days and is vomitting up blood.  What do I do?"    Hello.  A phone call to a hospital or vet is FREE.  At least call and ask if this is something that warrents a trip in to see professionals.  I rush my dogs in when they are sick...a child is even more important!  Scary.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	If you read some of the questions carefully you will find out the a lot of these parents have already called a doctor and are looking for someone to give their experiences with the same health issues.  I also see a lot of parents that have appointments coming up, notice something different but they are not sure if it really is an issue.  I have even come across a few where the baby had a fall but did not seem to be too bothered, but the parents just need to be reassured that all will be well.    I am much more bothered by Yahoo mommies that judge other mothers for seeking advice.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I don't know. I always love the questions like "help my baby fell down the stairs and now it wont quit crying" or "my water broke, what should I do now" It's like seriously get off of your computer and call the doctor... I also tend to stick to the petty questions or the silly questions... if my son seems to be in some major pain or really sick I'm always on the phone with the doc, or if it's bad, like when he fell out of his pool I take him to the ER, asking a question on the computer is the last thing on my mind. And like some people stated "they don't have insurance" I've called the doctor numerous times, and have never been asked for my insurance information, you don't have to pay for a phone call to the doc, so you really have no excuse. Sometimes I wonder if they are just joking, but I guess there are some really dumb people out there that will ask a serious medical question on here instead of calling a doctor.|`|AA11459214	They just want to know if what they are going through is normal or could wait til the morning. it's easier to jump on the internet than to sit on hold unless they need to go to the er. And why do you care the questions usually aren't life threatening anyways people are just curios if other people have gone through it too and how they solved the problem!

zk3Bp9uNaa	Even women with small breast can breast feed their babies - size doesnt matter!!!  Infact, smaller breasts make it easier to feed.    Dont worry too much, you will probably find oyur breast increase in size when bub is born and your milk comes in|`|5UcdeeX8aa	If I can breastfeed with an A cup then so can you. All you need is milk glands, and they will fill up when you are nursing. You probably will be in a regular A cup.|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	When I had my first I had gotten up to a D cup while pregnant. After my milk came in they got so big I couldn't wear a bra. It looked like I had two watermelons under my shirt. I don't think I left the house for 3 weeks because I looked crazy, lol. I wish I had been smaller so that when the milk did come in I wouldn't have been so disproportional. Don't worry you will be able to breast feed no matter what the size. You will be surprised how big they can get almost overnight.|`|cWP73qEsaa	you boobs havent grown yet but they will and milk will come even if you just have nipple lol. oh and beware because if you have my luck your breast will triple in size when the milk comes in and they hurt soo bad they were hard too but nice warm towels helped alot and breastfeeding as much as possible ( even if it hurts) that way they will empty out a bit and give you relief( i went on and on right? sorry hope i helped, and don't worry so much be happy and good luck|`|UYYe3NfZaa	good news in this department.  breast size doesn't matter.  you will produce as much breast milk as your baby needs.  that's what breasts are built for.  good luck and enjoy the new baby|`|uERNKwOYaa	breast size doesn't determine whether or not you can breast feed.  as far as i know, the only thing that does is whether or not you produce   enough milk, or whether or not your milk supply kicks in on time.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	well I know that everyone says that the breast size doesnt matter but I too have small breasts ( like 34 A US) and I did not go up a bra size in my pregnancy. They got slightly fuller but not bigger. Once my baby was born I was going to breastfeed him. He would try to eat for every hour and a half for about 45 min and he would get hungry soon after. At two weeks he had not gained any weight so the dr suggested I would supplement with formula. At that point I was so exhausted that I didnt even fight it. I started supplementing and he was finally full for about 2 1/2 hours.. From there I just started feeding him formula, it was less stressfull for me and more filling for him.   I had some milk ( it would leak from one boob when feeding from the other) but I dont think I was making enough. I blame my small boobies :)   Anyway all three of mine are healthy and fine and were fed with formula. I just didnt trust my boobs enough I guess.. Maybe if I had kept trying it would have worked but I just decided not to.   Good luck though. A lot of women with small breasts breastfeed, its just my own experience.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Seriously...size does not matter.  My boobs didn't grow until I gave birth anyway...as big as they were they actually got in the way.
kRaVa0Wraa	well you have to go to med school. so you had better be DAMN good at chemistry and biology.  and med school is really hard to get into.  i'd say your grades are pretty good, try to get them as close to all A's as possible, that way you can go to a good college and then get into med school.    edit:  Best Med Schools:  U of Pennsylvania  John Hopkins  Harvard  Columbia  Duke  U of Michigan    Good Med Schools    U of Pittsburgh  Case Western  Pritzker (U of Chicago)  UCLA  Stanford  Boston U    Decent Med Schools  Michigan State  Wayne State  U of Wisconsin  U of Cincinnati|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	of course you love kids u r a kid     do you just hang out with people 10 years older than you?|`|YWekskHcaa	well as long as you continue to keep your head down and get the grades you need to get into uni or college then you shoudl be fine    i no how you feel having your parent be not so confident.. my mum thought i wouldnt get inot this uni in sydney and then witha stroke of luck i got in.. and now she feels really bad for doubting me.    so goodluck and all the best.    xx|`|GGH0HVdvaa	if you keep working hard, graduate, go to college and study to be a pediatrician, sure! you can't not do it if you try hard enough!|`|JusiwmMSaa	yes if it helps any i am 15 and  an aspiring obgyn|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Harvard, Yale, UCLA|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	maybe if you calm down
r39EDGhPaa	So the kid doesn't feel singled out.  But i'd think they'd feel even more singled out, since they get put in special ed classes.  It's horrible.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Why would you not stand up for them instead?|`|1gVDZrPuaa	They want their kids to feel like everyone else.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	ah i know! and the way they are picked on is so horrible! the guys at my school always pretend to like this one mentally challenged kid but they're actually just making fun of him. and he doesnt get it.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	i dont know.  we have people at our school that are nice to them  but some when you say hey whats up, they threaten to bite you or some other crap  i see where their parents cannot keep them home or want them to be in "slower" classes so they can make friends and have as much as a "normal" life as possible, but it is sad|`|IiML4zYpaa	Wow, I fine this question really offensive. That's like saying why like a white girl go to all black school! No, this question is extremely rude. They want to get a normal education minus the fact of their disabilities. They want to be in a classroom just like a normal child! My cousin is deaf. He has the right to go to school just like the other kids do. He has hearing aids/ implants so he can hear. He chose to go to a regular school. He wanted to know what it was like. If you put mentally changed all in one class room they will want to know what it's like outside of that class.   I'm friends with a few mentally changed people. They are really nice. (: They want to be in a class with normal kids so they feel normal too. & Yes, there is a point to stick up for them. Don't even try and say there isn't. I find you really rude.|`|H90uflbFaa	i have no clue, its really an ashame though. i have a kid in my english class who has really bad autism and he hides under desks, threatens to hurt people, and basically barks at people. i have no clue why hes not in a special school.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	The world is tough. I'm legally blind and went to school with 'normal' kids all my life. It made me a stronger person. The world isn't always going to be accommodating to their disabilities. You can't segregate them. Really it is worse then sending them to public school.|`|chfILbonaa	I'm and sort of like that but i try to blend in but anyways i think the parents cant afford to put them i nspecial school they want the normal kids to be good role models for the mentaly challenged and they want normal friends although it never really happened it made me stronger on the inside after 9 years of being teased i go tused to it and well it dont even hurt me anymore i laugh it off now and well in highschool i don get teased anymore and really im starting to miss it alot im 14 btw|`|3zSYBeTFaa	As I see it, two reasons:  Those kids cannot be coddled, they need to learn how to deal with the world how it is.  Their parents won't always be around.  Think how hard it would be if they were all of a sudden traumatized by contact with the real world.  in the old days, they were segregated and institutionalized.  Many of them died from neglect.    2.  For you!  When you see the teasing, do something about it!  Maybe stand up for them, tell a teacher distract the bullies...I grew up with a disabled brother and he lived in the moment and brings us so much joy.  Make friends, not all disabled children are joyful and joy bringing but a lot of them are.      Learning and teaching tolerance needs to start now.  Ask one of their teachers/aides how to get started.    thanks|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Your compassion ended up being ignorance.    Your ignorance could be tantamount to, saying that, kids who might also be physically challenged, should not be allowed public schools.    Keeping kids that are physically and/or, mentally challenged away from the general population(public school) summarily amounts to major self-esteem problems for the child.    They have the same rights, as those who aren't physically and/or, mentally challenged.|`|G3lcNV85aa	Well, because usually the parents want to integrate their kids, and usually they don't know half the stuff that goes on in school. I personally am very passionate about this question because my brother has autism. We've worked with him over the years and it's almost not noticeable with medication..but he's still showing a lot of autistic characteristics. He gets bullied so much at school my sister and I are about to go insane. (We're triplets--14) My sister and I stand up for him a lot, as do a lot of my friends but kids who are the bullies are the ones with the real issues. That they're able to willingly, for their own insecurity to put down a kid with a mental disability. It's disgusting and a pity. If a parent sent their kid to a school with only mentally disable kids it wouldn't prepare them for when they're older and are not only surrounded by people with a disability. Whether the person is bullied or not is still a shame, but they still should be prepared...but then again if they're severely impaired they should probably go to a school like you suggested so their needs are better fitted. Truly, I will never understand why people/kids do that..it's a shame. But they're my two cents.     Confrontation is sooo sweet though, I must say. One time my mom was checking out the class lists and was writing it down so she could tell us. (End of summer break) And this kid walks up with his mom, reads the list and is like, "Ohhh mann..Cole (my brother) is in my class.." And my mom looks over and says in a very lovely voice, "Hi..I'm Coles mom" The kid and the mom are like scrambling for words. My sister and I confronted him at school...just words though, violence does nothing.|`|YWekskHcaa	becasue just becasue they are mentally challenged doesnt mean they are any different, they are normal people just liek you and me that want to be treated with respect.    why dont you stand up for them. or go and tell a teacher, you sound like your the oe picking on them..    most special school have a certian criteria for allowing kids into the school, but if a mainstream school can facillitate for these kids then thats even better.    grow up.|`|AA10672842	I don't think it is the student who is developmentally  challenged who has the problem. I don't understand the need to bully and intimidate someone because they are perceived as different.I must agree with EmaWeeE that the parents of special needs students want what every other parent wants, an opportunity for their child to reach their fullest potential academically as well as socially.It is up to each of us to stand up and speak out when we see something that is wrong ethically.If a bully is challenged on their immature tactics it will put them on notice that their behaviour will not be tolerated.How we treat those who have special needs makes a strong statement about our character or the lack of it. At the end of the day don't we all want to be accepted and have a sense of belonging,why should special needs students be any different?|`|WugKYI4zaa	probably because they are trying to give their child a normal social life. and most of the time the kids that are mean to them are not worth fighting and u should just try to be as nice and friendly to those children, because they are just like you except with changes and challenges.|`|RnLzXeMGaa	i had that at my primery and they never go picked on   we had a specail class for them and they would have a class rm and go there for 1 block a week and we always helped them and really liked them   some people would even go to there class at lunch and take them out side and spend there lunch with them  they had a great time and they had a lot of friends and people were nice and kind and no one picked on them     :) this might boast ur confidence for some school with mentally challenge students|`|k31jFSd0aa	They want their kids to feel normal, why not stick up for them?|`|M4fiDYE6aa	wow I ttly agree. people are so sensitive and PC on here. Like the person above me, what does a person mental disabilities have to do with race? seriously come on now. that person obviously dont stand up for any. and the teachers DO ignore them getting picked on.|`|a32638d07cd5df195350b94e7ec64628aa	maybe you should have reworded your question...my brother has down syndrome and he goes to a regular school... There has been a few times when someone gets ignorant and picks on him and they get they're *** beat...but usually the kids are really nice and help him out...and putting them into a school with other mentally challenged children is just like saying lets put black people in one school and whites in the other...its no diffrent...my brother is no diffrent than any of the other kids at school, he might even have a little bit more common sense..and i honestly dont think you have a brother who is "mentally challenged" because if you did you would understand that not everyone picks on them...and putting them in a separate school will only make them look like outcasts...
bzxPBkbtaa	I put my babies into their own cribs when they outgrew their bassinets. I put my son into a pack and play but I changed to a crib because I felt it was too drafty on the floor in our cold climate. He was 4 1/2 months.  I wouldn't worry about a monitor unless you happen to already have one. Your ears are tuned for baby sounds.|`|vI0WnAiOaa	if he has breathing issues when sleeping i would keep him very close, co-sleep even. that way you are right there if anything happens.  my first child was a nice good deep sleeper and could sleep anywhere anytime so i didnt have to worry, but my next child is a bad sleeper and still spends some of the night in my bed at 2 years old. if your room is big enough for the cot then put it there if not try co-sleeping and definitely get a monitor to hear him if he is in the other room.|`|x2YuF1pxaa	why not co-sleep? sooo many people do it and it'll strengthen the bond you have with your baby.|`|vt76wtBcaa	i think even with the breathing issuses it would be ok for him to be in the next room, WITH the monitor. that way all the sounds he makes in his sleep you will be better able to hear and you wont be getting up worried all night. also, i would put keep him in the pack-n-play still but in the new room, then in a few weeks put him in the crib. just so he has to only get used to one things at a time|`|Z2HvqgQkaa	i personally would not do the co-sleep thing....you will never get privacy and it will be hard to break the pattern of sleeping with you. my son was in his own crib at about 3 weeks old and was perfectly fine. i did use a monitor just in case i could not hear him. and he was just about as close to me as yours will be but totally up to you. good luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i am a paranoid mom; so i would have a monitor anyways...mine is seven, almost 8mos and still sleeps in our room, but for the past few weeks she has been napping in her crib only and she sleeps much better in there we are just trying to get her used to sleeping in there...; i too would love for her to sleep next to us until she's thirty, but i guess she will be moving soon...if u r having breathing probs i def wouldn't move baby until that was resolved....|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I have a condo and my sons room is in the back, our place is about 1200 sq ft so it isn't THAT big, but I have a monitor anyhow, just incase!  The video Summer by Graco is awesome!    So, I slept with my son until he was 7 months.  After 6 months, I really wanted my bed back, so we started transitioning him to his bedroom.  Which sucked.  It took until about 8 months for him to get used to not being allowed back in our bed to sleep.  And, I am sure people will HATE me for saying this, but the only way we got him to sleep there and through the night was the cry it out method that our doctor told us to use.  But do what works best for you and your life.  For me, having my own bed and own space works best for our family and makes us all happier.  Funny thing is, now when I try to nap with him (he is 10 months) in our bed, he is not having it!  He will only sleep in his crib!!!  Good luck with everything.|`|gyoylefvaa	He will be fine. buy a video monitor if that make you feel better.  if he is 1 years old is time for his to sleep in his crib.|`|AA11865529	Most people put the baby in the crib when they bring it home. You don't say how old your baby is, but if there is a breathing problem, you might want to work that out before putting baby in it's own room.    You don't need a monitor, you can just go and check on your baby. You can leave the doors open and listen for cries. I find most moms are very light sleepers.
rjVALevtaa	It can vary widely. Some women get a period as soon as 4-6 weeks after giving birth, others don't get a period for several months. If you're breastfeeding it is likely that it will be several months, maybe more.     I'm not exactly sure how Mirena will affect your period but considering that Mirena contains hormones it may cause your period to be a bit off once you do get it back.|`|bzxPBkbtaa	not sure about when you will get your period because it depends on if you are nursing. HOWEVER, do yourself a real favor and look up Mirena reviews on the web. I, too, was considering it until I read all the horror stories!!|`|AA11865529	Periods come around 6-8 weeks, maybe more, after. But if you are nursing it can be 8 months or more.|`|14JQ11AUaa	You CAN nurse on the Mirena. I did not have my period until the day it was put in! I had mine done when my son was 8 weeks. It lasted for 1 week, he is now 19 weeks and 2 days..I just started my 2nd period today since his birth! It really depends on you and how your body is? I think after you have it put in you will start or at the least spot for a few days! Good luck, take 800mg of ibuprofen 30 mins. before you go in, it will help SO much :)
AA11763588	Well... Phantom Pregnancy is a term that makes most of the doctors completely confused. Phantom Pregnancy is also called as psedocyesis that means false pregnancy. It is practically uncommon condition that is usually triggered in females when they have strong desire for motherhood. Such desire makes them feel like pregnant woman and then, slowly they become a victim of Phantom Pregnancy.    So if I where her, I'd head to the DR and have a blood test. If she is really pregnant then she needs to start going to the DR anyway.|`|6avKnzkoaa	I would suggest that your sister in law go get a blood test done, or ask for a ultrasound to check. It may well be a false alarm. However, best to be sure.|`|UThG15FLaa	In my opinion -  This sounds like to me, it's a defiant phantom pregnancy.  Sometimes a man or women can develop pregnancy, just from wanting to be pregnant.     Seriously!, Men and women can both Develop the symptoms, of pregnancy, but actually not be pregnant.    Just to be sure i suggest your sister go get blood work done ;]  ? Deee
VMASMHX6aa	I don't think that any animal can be pregnant and in heat at the same time. It's just not how it works!    She might nest even though she's not pregnant. You'll know soon enough!|`|uERNKwOYaa	as far as i know, an female animal has to be in heat in order to get pregnant.

I almost wish I could fast-forward time, but I think I would miss out on too many fun experiences.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Some of my friends when I was younger felt they were meant to have lots of kids, I even thought they were really maternal and would take to it naturally.

zbjaBgyEaa	I think it depends on the name.    If you named your son Christopher people might not realize it's from Winnie the Pooh.  Ditto with something like Rachel (from Friends) or Scarlett (Gone with the Wind).  They are pretty ambiguous name - its fairly common.  Some things are innoculous like that.  Some things, however aren't.    However, if you chose something a little more, erm, unique like Renesmee people are going to know EXACTLY where it came from - Twilight.  And if you combine that with other names (i.e. Edward, Carslyle, Jasper, Jacob, Emmett, Rosalie, etc( from that movie/book its going to be pretty obvious.    Personally I wouldn't do it if I felt it were obvious.  I'm just not a big fan of the idea.  I love the name Hermione (and I did get it from Harry Potter) - I think it's really beautiful name.  But I worry about its modern connotations to Harry Potter.|`|AA11265535	I wouldn't name my child after the character in a movie but I would use the name just because I like it. I like the name Rhett but if I ever name my child that then it won't be because of Rhett Butler from Gone With the Wind. It will be because I like it. And I heard of the name Wade from Gone With the Wind too and now I like that name but if I name one of my children that then it won't be after Wade Hampton Hamilton from the film|`|b7smO9h1aa	I don't think its that weird but it depends on the name also like i would name my kids Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Jimmy Cricket. My sisters close friend has an Isabella Jane, Alice Rosalie, Edward Charles, Jacob Ryan, and a Cullen Jasper all after the twilight series but like for her Jane, Rose, Charles, Jacob and Ryan were family names. But personally i wouldn't do it, but its cool to see other parents do it.|`|hfkyWMCyaa	Going excessive over it and having everyone of your childrens names from the book/show is just crazy.    Having just one named after it is fine.

Blake, Penn, Leighton is ok.    when I watched the OC: Ryan, Marissa, Kirsten|`|9ua43BM6aa	I don't like the idea of naming after shows and books in groups. It seems like something you do with pets...    Like having the whole Brady Bunch as your kids? Awkward.      However, I do like the idea of being inspired for names from books and movies. Like Phinneas from A Separate Peace or Holden from A Catcher In The Rye.|`|AeARjAD5aa	I guess it's good b/c she knew they all sound ok together since they are on the show, but it is alittle weird. I love the name Lorelai, and it's actually on my list of names if I have a girl, but if I had more kids I don't think I'd go name the whole cast, well maybe if I have a boy b/c I've always loved the name Luke, even before I saw the show. But in general back to my point, it's odd.|`|86oPkfzOaa	If they all come from the same one.....no.  If it's just one.......yes    I lik the name Luna, Lily, etc. from Harry potter. But, I would never name my kids Lily James Harry Ginny and Albus.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I think the names she chose are classic enough that even when the show is just a memory, the names will still be around.    In general?  No, I'd rather name my kids after John Kennedy or Maya Angelou...    TX Mom|`|ODMCAcPDaa	I love Sawyer too, always have... although I didn't get it from Lost, I got it from Tom Sawyer, everyone associates it with Lost.  I think that's fine b/c that guy is HOT!  I would def name my baby boy Sawyer.    I love naming kids for literature characters or authors.  I like Austen for a girl too.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	I don't see anything wrong with naming a kid after a book/TV show/movie, but it can get a little odd when all of your kids are named after the same book/TV show/movie. I mean, doing so makes you seem a little...well, obsessed and also incapable of coming up with names of your own, I guess.    But hey, at least they weren't named after Twilight characters.|`|HyknHVV5aa	I think in the long run naming children after books/tv/movies is just fine. Even though adults around the child within the first 10 years of their life will recognize the name from the movie or whatever its from, but after the kid is 10 few adults and no kids will recognize the names.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	That seems kinda creepy to me. Sometimes you watch a tv show and say "oh, that name is really neat sounding!" And why not use that name? But when you really choose the names because of the show...ehh, that's creepy.   Of course, that's just my opinion.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	I think naming all of them from one show/movie is weird. but each one after an individual book i think is fine. a lot of my favorite names come from books, but not the same one|`|CqR6daqnaa	Seems a bit juvenile. I'd name my kids after a character but I wouldn't name them all after characters from the same book, movie, etc.  You should've asked her how come Rory gets no love, LOL.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Depends on the name.    Like naming my child Mowgli..HECCCK no.    Angelica...yes.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I love Gilmore Girls, but that is really weird.

I guess i don't really have room to talk since my last two sons are named after Godfathers in the Portuguese and Italian mafias.( as you may of guessed my hubby is half Portuguese and half Italian)
HhPgZDDzaa	It depends on if you are going to exclusively pump or if you are pumping and nursing. If you are exclusively pumping, then DEFINITELY invest in some storage bags. The Lansinoh bags are the best on the market right now. My cousin exclusively pumped with both her boys because neither would nurse, and she had an entire upright freezer FULL of milk by the time they were 4 months old. I would have at least 4 bottles (if you are double pumping) that way you can have two clean bottles while the other two are in the dishwasher. Also make sure you have extra valves/membranes, and some cleaning wipes in case you have to take it on a trip and can't clean it properly right away|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I liked the bags, as I got to a point where I pumped extra and could freeze it.  But if you live near Target, they usually carry Medela items.    You'll probably be ok with 8 bottles, or the fatter kind.  Those skinnier ones, Id fill up 2 a pumping.     I also got extra membranes, and the little yellow things.  Lost a couple.    And liked the car charger too.
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	They had soap then. According to the website below, they found evidence of soap-like materials existing from prehistoric times.     And they also used herbs, etc. from crushed flowers and other plants to make cosmetics and perfumed water.     http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/of...    The real question is how did people bathe without hot water? LOL Ugh. No indoor plumbing meant heating a lot of hot water, and it was quite an effort, so they didn't do it very often.    ETA: There is evidence, though, to suggest the 'yearly bath' ritual is a falsehood. Apparently Charlemagne bathed daily in a stream - but he was considered royalty, obviously. But anyway, click here and scroll down to "Bathing and Bouquets."     The same thing is prevalent in 1800s literature .. if you read the stories of Laura Ingalls Wilder, for instance, they talk about bathing once a week, because it's an effort to heat the water, etc. and everyone bathes in the same water. Yack.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	they didn't.. the Romans had a fascinating way of cleaning. while in the sauna room (don't think it's the proper name but oh well) they'd rub oil (mainly olive oil, they'd sometimes have them scented too) in there skin and scrape it of with all the sweat, they'd then bathe after. they did a lot for bathing did the romans, very odd bunch if you ask me.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap Soap.2...  Soap's History    [edit] Soap's Early history    The earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in Ancient Babylon.[1] A formula for soap consisting of water, alkali and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC.    The Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates that ancient Egyptians bathed regularly and combined animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance. Egyptian documents mention that a soap-like substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.    [edit] Roman history    It had been reported that a factory producing soap-like substances was found in the ruins of Pompeii (AD 79). However, this has proven to be a misinterpretation of the survival of some soapy mineral substance,[citation needed] probably soapstone at the Fullonica where it was used for dressing recently cleansed textiles. Unfortunately this error has been repeated widely and can be found in otherwise reputable texts on soap history. The ancient Romans were generally ignorant of soap's detergent properties, and made use of the strigil to scrape dirt and sweat from the body. The word "soap" (Latin sapo) appears first in a European language in Pliny the Elder's Historia Naturalis, which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes, but the only use he mentions for it is as a pomade for hair; he mentions rather disapprovingly that among the Gauls and Germans men are likelier to use it than women.[2]    A story encountered in some places claims that soap takes its name from a supposed "Mount Sapo" where ancient Romans sacrificed animals. Rain would send a mix of animal tallow and wood ash down the mountain and into the clay soil on the banks of the Tiber. Eventually, women noticed that it was easier to clean clothes with this "soap". The location of Mount Sapo is unknown, as is the source of the "ancient Roman legend" to which this tale is typically credited.[1] In fact, the Latin word sapo simply means "soap"; it was borrowed from a Celtic or Germanic language, and is cognate with Latin sebum, "tallow", which appears in Pliny the Elder's account. Roman animal sacrifices usually burned only the bones and inedible entrails of the sacrificed animals; edible meat and fat from the sacrifices were taken by the humans rather than the gods. Animal sacrifices in the ancient world would not have included enough fat to make much soap. The legend about Mount Sapo is probably apocryphal.    Galen describes soap-making using lye and prescribes washing to carry away impurities from the body and clothes[3]. The best soap was German, according to Galen; soap from Gaul was second best. This is the first record of true soap as a detergent.    Zosimos of Panopolis c. 300AD describes both soap and soap making.[4]    [edit] Islamic history    True soaps made from vegetable oils (such as olive oil), aromatic oils (such as thyme oil) and lye (al-Soda al-Kawia) were first produced by Muslim chemists in the medieval Islamic world.[5] The formula for soap used since then hasn't changed. From the beginning of the 7th century, soap was produced in Nablus (Palestine), Kufa (Iraq) and Basra (Iraq). Soaps, as we know them today, are descendants of historical Arabian soaps. Arabian soap was perfumed and colored, some of the soaps were liquid and others were solid. They also had special soap for shaving. It was sold for 3 Dirhams (0.3 Dinars) a piece in 981 AD. The Persian chemist Al-Razi wrote a manuscript on recipes for true soap. A recently discovered manuscript from the 13th century details more recipes for soap making; e.g. take some sesame oil, a sprinkle of potash, alkali and some lime, mix them all together and boil. When cooked, they are poured into molds and left to set, leaving hard soap.    In semi-modern times soap was made by mixing animal fats with lye. Because of the caustic lye, this was a dangerous procedure (perhaps more dangerous than any present-day home activities) which could result in serious chemical burns or even blindness. Before commercially-produced lye (sodium hydroxide) was commonplace, potash, potassium hydroxide, was produced at home from the ashes of a hardwood fire.    [edit] Modern history    Castile soap was later produced in Europe from the 16th century. Modern castile soap is still popular, being made exclusively from vegetable oil (as opposed to animal fat). Bronner's soap, for example, is based on hemp oil in addition to jojoba oil.  1922 magazine advertisement for Palmolive Soap    In modern times, the use of soap has become universal in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of hygiene in reducing the population size of pathogenic microorganisms. Manufactured bar soaps first became available in the late nineteenth century, and advertising campaigns in Europe and the United States helped to increase popular awareness of the rela|`|weA0Xdszaa	they were a-stinky|`|gYTggPu0aa	They did not.

irLnPW4aaa	This is not excessive.  Believe me, they would rather you keep him home when he is sick than send him in to infect the other kids, especially in first grade when they are not so good about hand washing, covering their mouth, sneezing in a tissue, etc.      Like someone else said, if it is a day here and there while his actually sick they are not going to start to get concerned unless it is weeks.|`|Nq51mZcBaa	I don't think that sounds excessive. It's almost February, so missing 5 days in the whole school year so far isn't much at all. When I was in 5th grade there was a girl in my class who's mom would hardly ever bring her to school. She wasn't sick or anything either it was just that her mom couldn't be bothered to get her to school on time most days, so she just wouldn't bring her at all those days. Fast forward 10 years, and the girl is doing well in university. So in the long-term missing gradeschool shouldn't hurt.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	If they are legitimately sick, you can't help it...My granddaughter's school thinks any school missed is too much, except when they are running a fever or vomiting!|`|44OH7Si6aa	They can miss a lot of days. They have to be absent for more than 15 days, unexcused, before the school starts talking about holding them back and making them repeat the grade. Just make sure you always bring in a doctor's note verifying he was sick and the two of y'all will be perfectly fine. The school understands that smaller kids get sick, and if they were at home with mommy, the exposure of being around other kids all day means they get sick even more often.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The school doesn't have any right to "get upset" with you.

So your child is fine.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think the school will really say anything unless he starts falling behind in school.  Since you pick up his homework and return it back to school he'll probably still be caught up with the rest of the kids.      Ours missed soooo much school in Kindergarten do to that 24 hr after throwing up rule.  Some kid told her how to make herself throw up, and she must have missed school every 2 weeks it was a nightmare.  We finally had to start a reward system so that she wouldn't fake being sick for attention or to stay home.  (This is after spending 5 grand on doctors to find out she wasn't actually sick)|`|HyknHVV5aa	I think if the child is absent for 30 days in general you get a notice.

BonyOJLRaa	I agree with you, 100%. I think more and more people should consider adoption these days, as our world is already overpopulated. I see a lot of people with like 4 or more kids, and my husband and I just can't help but think they are being selfish and lazy for not using birth control. What is wrong with just having one? OMG, it bugs me. I have been on the pill for 6, going on 7 years, my husband is getting a vasectomy in 4 years when he is 30, And yes, I am a Christian, I'm 23, but have no desire to have children. Just my opinion, try not to jump too far down my throat people.     By the way, you are literally going to get a cesspool of answers on here, so good luck! Also, the Bible does say ''Be fruitful and multiply'', and ''Children are a gift from the Lord, they are a reward from Him'', but that was 2,000+ years ago, not today, and humans are no where near in danger of being extinct.|`|4LPINXoUaa	if someone i knew said that to me i would worry for them as they sound suicidal sorry..a baby is meant to be a gift from god! not something bad.your parents made me feel bit scared if that's how you think.sorry no offence meant towards you|`|fFRD3o22aa	I think you are interpreting the scripture too narrowly. I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) and I believe that for sure there is an afterlife. I also believe that you have to work to get to Heaven but I dont believe that only the select few will go to Heaven while the rest will go to Hell. Why would such a merciful and loving God send his children down to earth only so that a few could return to Him? He wants us to return to Him and this is why he gives us second chances through repentance. Jesus said "come follow me" and I believe as we follow him the pathway to Heaven will be in better view. So back to your original question about bringing children into this world, God commanded us to multiply and replenish the earth. We are to teach our children good morals so that they can be good examples to others and help others along the way. Children bring about some of the best joys in life. Adoption is a great tool especially if you are infertal but you should also give children of your own a chance at life. It shouldnt be up to you if its right for them to come down to earth. I think that God will let you know if you should have a child or not. Maybe this very question of yours is some sort of sign that you need to have a child. I hope this helped because your question really stood out to me for some reason and I wanted to express how I feel on this subject. :)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I don't believe in Christianity therefore, I don't believe in hell.    Also, you claim that it is irresponsible, that afterlife could be horrible...well, what if we are coming from a horrible afterlife and being born into this life is basically giving us  a break before we go back? I don't believe in that but...you get it.      Anyways, I do get what you are saying.Fortuantly, I just don't believe in it.      ***You have no clue of knowing what there is beyond the grave.Just because you haven't figured it out yet doesn't mean anything.

(btw i don't have kids) but this gives me something to think about now i guess.|`|arI7peKmaa	The thing you dont get is that Christians take a few things from their religion that they like then follow that, ignore all the other stuff and then make up a few things of their own. It is all to give them a secure, happy psychology.    EDIT: First off we can be pretty certain that there is no afterlife, it is just an a idea created by man. If there is a God (which there is not a shred of evidence for) then he is not (and i say this with absolute certainty) the christian god. I would assume that he would also make the after life fair and decent unlike the imaginary god concocted by any of mans religions.|`|627pWyVkaa	majority of people are not religious and a lot of faiths do not state we are going to hell.

Its irresponsible to have a child you can not care for, take care of, afford, or know how to parent properly.|`|AA11394813	Many of the women who have drowned their children etc, have said they were worried that their children would end up in Hell, so they took their lives while they were still innocent and had a shot at Heaven.     I do not think it is irresponsible. The Bible also says be fruitful and multiply, and that children are a blessing, etc.     As a parent it is your job to raise your children to be good upstanding citizens who love God, and their fellow man. It is also important to remember that we are all equal in the eyes of God, and so even though here on earth we have ties to our blood relatives, we are actually called to have that same fire about all people. In other words, we should all feel as strongly as you do, and use it as motivation to reach out to everyone we come into contact with.|`|WbJPQM1naa	Well I once read something very interesting:      We face the greatest odds against us, of our entire lives,   at the moment of our conception.

With this is in mine, can't we just trust HIM Who created all and HIS judgments that are wise and loving, that each and every child that is conceived is made to fulfill a Divine plan and purpose?   Who am I to question HIS plan?    "In your mother's womb I knew you,     You were fearfully and wonderfully made!"    I am sad for you and your dim view of your future.

I don't really follow any religion because I think most religions use scare tactics to conform religion. I don't believe the way to God is fear.     I believe the Bible is mostly true...but I don't believe it is meant to be taken literally. You have to remember that the Bible was wrote so long ago, and there were no computers, no typewriters, no mean of mass production for books, therefore the Bible was told over and over again, in the form of stories (this is my opinion).  To ask someone to believe that, for example someone could be swallowed whole by a whale and survive is ludicrous. But to tell someone "thou shall not kill" is understandable, do you get what I mean?     The bottom line of what you say is true-we all don't know what happens to us when we die. The way that you think it may be bad, someone else could think it will be beautiful. Do I think it is irresponsible? No, not really. I think children are a gift from God, and I think we all have to just live our lives and deal with whatever happens to us or is going to happen.|`|XT3uyW5kaa	No, it's not irresponsible. To put it in terms, what you're saying is kind of like asking, "why eat today because tonight you might die anyway?" That's why we're just supposed to live our lives and go with it. Not having children because of not knowing what lies ahead is living in fear. If one wants to be a mother, she longs to take care of someone and teach them how to live, then she should go for it. The same for fathers. You can't just stop what you want because you don't know what lies ahead. What if it's something good, what if it's something bad? You just don't know, there's a fifty/fifty chance.|`|wFfeayBMaa	Thank God your parents didn't think about this first. Think about what you are saying, you wouldn't exist.

If you want a guess i say the 1st one because of the way she is posing in the picture.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	I would say the second one because she looks older, and more mature.  But, then again, people can surprise you.|`|44uorNhOaa	they look like the same girl and both are very pretty. but i would say the second pic b/c she looks more like not slutty just more grown and by the way she dresses i guess. lol|`|g2elB8eDaa	Option A... I am not sure why I just have a gut feeling.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	i think b is now pregnant... it looks like she would be more sexual than the first one|`|E6A8MKZwaa	If this wasn't presented as a bit of a trick question, I would say Option B was the pregnant one.  My reasoning is because you are both sisters, and sisters often have similar body types.  However Option B's (no, I'm not a perv, just another pregnant lady) breasts look a size or two bigger than Option A's, which is usually caused by pregnancy.      However, I have to question myself, since I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover...so does that mean it's really Option A that's pregnant?      By the way, you guys both really are gorgeous!  Tell us who is actually the older sis, and of course who is pregnant, when you pic a best answer, kay?  :-)  And congratulations to whoever is actually pregnant!|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	I would guess the second one, only because the first picture looks like a magazine clipping or something? But they do look very similar in looks, there faces.|`|dd63e8475e881a3f45f29502b473e0e8aa	i think the second one is. i dont know why, there's just something about her. she looks like she's confident in herself and knows what she wants. they're both beautiful.|`|lEJCZP0Qaa	it wouldnt let me see first pic x|`|Bi37YWm6aa	Option B, she just seems more of the Mommy type.    I wanna know which one! tell us :)|`|AA11762804	I would go with option B if i had to choose in the first one her stomach is flat and her breasts are ( or look smaller) and in the second her breasts look bigger and her stomach from what i could see dose not look as flat. Honestly if we look past these two factors due to lighting, different positions the pics were taken and different clothing, which can make a person look bulkier she dose not look pregnant at all.|`|XUXIsc1Daa	they look the same to me  but i think the first one has a more promiscuous pose|`|AA11763588	The pictures look almost the same... but I'll go with B. I have no explanation just a guess.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	they look like they are the same person.. but well.. I will guess the first one, option a is pregnant. I dont know why really just a guess. They both look really sweet and somewhat naive too.. really no big clues in the pics for me... how old is your sister? the girl  looks really young

6igjX2cnaa	It could be the fertility blend hun since it's new to you.  i have never taken it, but wanted to wish you best of luck hun!!!      - is that a sorority photo in your avatar ? :)  Just curious cuz it reminds me of the ones I had to do for my sorority composite :)|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	It never made me late dear.  It made me pregnant and hence I was late.  =)  I've never heard of anyone having late periods.  Maybe it's starting to make your periods more clockwork in a 28-30 day cycle.   You could be pregnant as well dear!!!  Took me one month being on it to get pregnant! I hope you are!!!!!|`|C9RNQ97Baa	I am 30 years old and I have been taking Fertility Blend for 3 months, well this is my third month. I have never been late since taking this supplement that is until now! I am 4 days late I have taken 2 pregnancy test and both were neg and I have been using my clearblue easy fertility monitor and this month I did not ovulate. So I don't know if the fertility blend has anything to do with that so I am too looking for answers. Well hope you are late because you are pregnant! Good Luck
r39EDGhPaa	Let her ruin her life.  She'll realize she was stupid eventually.    She'll have to grow up real quick and hopefully her parents love her a lot, because they'll be raising the kid.  While you can sit back and laugh, while she's changing diapers and breast feeding, you're out with your friends or having sleepovers.  She isn't your problem.|`|ThdFMIFUaa	Oh my gosh! Doesn't she want to go to college, and be married and in love before she starts a family? Doesn't she want to follow her dreams before she is tied down? Babies are expensive and time consuming. They are not a play thing or something to do when you get bored. They are a LIVING CREATURE. A HUMAN. A little baby. Is she really prepared for that responsibility?    Your friend can ruin her life if she wants to, but it's just not fair for her child not to grow up in a normal family.|`|MQjsspQ6aa	You can't stop her no one can this is her choice and the only person who can stop her from ttc is herself!|`|wRckyuh6aa	maybe she means at some point in life. Your may have miss understood her.|`|AA12115728	Hire her out as a live-in babysitter for someone with a newborn for her entire spring break.  Tell the parents that she is to be totally responsible for the baby to give the new mom a break.  Get the new parents to be there, but not lift a finger the whole time.  When your girl returns, give her a gift card for Build-A-Bear Workshop.  She'll be totally satisfied.|`|uVE3JcnVaa	tell her to go to one of those orphanages and like just chill with the kids there? i know some ppl who did that and it helped!|`|97b5127ddddc7a556167788c3c948831aa	punch her in the ovaries|`|w5aVE1LUaa	You can't.

bT5AIRuQaa	Believe me...Your parents would love to party but right now they have a job to do...that job is to raise you to be a well adjusted, thoughtful, intelligent adult.  Of course you're not going to agree with a lot of what they say..You are not that adult yet.  So do what they tell you and try to see the big picture.  In 4-6 years you'll be on your own, with a job and can buy for yourself anything you want. Good Luck!|`|VygBNA0Waa	of course your parents want to party but they cant because of you they need to set good exsamples so you can look up to them  would you rather parents that sit in the lounge room with there bong and line of speed on the coffee table what type of child would you turn into a drug up out of control child that no one cares about   be thank ful for what you have|`|hGmq5IuZaa	grow up and become a big hairy biker ..with a "I heart mom tattoo"|`|1AOjQSwOaa	Believe me you are gonna thank them in the future they ere trying too protect you i am 14 i live in Bolivia I have friends of 14 that are not virgins they smoke they get drugs they steal and they are stupid I talk to them but i don't try to be their friends that's because of my parents influence in my life they helped me to understand. An that PS3 well maybe they don't want to buy it for you because of the games that they offer like sex games or that stuff.|`|AA10241682	Well, get a job and save up for that stuff yourself, their job right now is raise you and teach you how to be a good person and Your parents are middle-class people. They shouldn't have to get you the stuff that you don't need live, they are giving you free room and board so deal with it and you are under their roof so you need to live by their rules until you are moved on your own.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	Stop being such a spoiled little brat.  Your parents pay for piano and tutors because they help you get ahead in life.  Basketball trips are also good for your health.  A PS3 is a waste of money and makes you lazy and stupid.  If you want one so bad get a job and pay for it yourself.  As far as friends and girlfriends go, yeah your parents are probably a bit strict.  They are only looking out for you.  One day you will thank them.
0qP8gLpyaa	Since this is 9 months away I don't think you have to rush out and plan it today. You have plenty of time to think and plan with that kind of time.    Just play music she likes in the background and get scrapbook sets for each of the guests,  a supply of good card stock and papers, glue sticks, scissors, etc.. for them to use and let them make their own scrapbooks.  You can get the 8x8 spiral ones fairly inexpensively at craft places and if you watch for sales you could probably find cute slumber party stickers and general little embellishmetns for them to use OR put on the invitation to bring scrapbook supplies with you and each girl could bring their own to use/share.|`|CRFLKFenaa	Hey,     Instead of having the girls bring their own pictures, I thought we could take pictures of them together. At 2:30 p.m., guests met us at Sunsplash, a water park. I brought two waterproof cameras ($7.50 ea.) and a bouquet of flowers ($7). The four girls took pictures of each other splashing, jumping in the water, going down water slides, and posing with flowers (in each others faces and behind heads like antennae), and I took some pictures with my camera. At 5:00 my husband took the film to be developed in one hour (double prints) while we played in the water longer and then ate pizza. We picked up the photos ($18) on the way home. The week before, I picked up view front binders ($1.79 ea.), color paper, photo splits and glue dots to stick on pictures($5), 3-hole punched standard sheet protectors ($3 for 50 and acid-free), and water/beach/friends theme stickers/die cuts ($25). We went home, opened gifts, ate cake, and then spread out different-edged scissors, punches, stickers, and paper on the dining room table. We had each of the girls choose 15 pictures to start, then it was a free-for-all with the leftover pictures. Amazingly, we had plenty of great pictures. They each made a cover and 6-8 pages. We started scrapbooking about 8:30 p.m., and I had to make them stop at 1:00 a.m.! It was a sleepover party, so I took some more pictures of them munching goodies, crashed in their sleeping bags (all zonked by 2:00 - halfway through a Mary Kate & Ashley video), and eating breakfast the next morning. After we got those developed, my daughter did a couple more pages of the sleepover part. The girls had a great time! You could also make the scrapbooks about their favourite bands and music. Just get heaps of magazines and let them cut them out! Hope this helps!|`|Nq51mZcBaa	There isn't really "scrapbooking" specific music...so just choose music that she likes. Maybe you could do one of those picture cakes, where you go to a bakery and they can use the icing to replicate a picture...that's pretty scrapbook-ish :)  I'm pretty sure Baskin-Robbins still does it.
UTjWlj9Yaa	Like my boyfriend.     Kidding. No, but really, he will grow out of it- or find girls to hang out with. Just explain the whole condom, std pregnancy thing to him or buy him some books so he can at least educate himself while he's locked up in his room doing the nasty.|`|44OH7Si6aa	He will grow out of it. He's just hitting puberty and needs to figure out how to control the hormones

mcywqcHuaa	parents usually hate everything their kids like. that's just fact. my parents hate:  my music  my movies  my clothes  my friends  my personality    and of course, they adore my little brother.     luckily, i'm 18 and almost out of the woods.    you, however, have a serious problem. your mom sounds like she has biiiig issues. save confrontation for your last bullet. hit her with being nice, understanding, and compromise.     also, go to your friend's and their parents. borrow clothes. explain your situation to their parents. get help for yourself.    also, NEVER let anyone tell you that what you like is stupid, or ugly. love who you are. find out who you are.     i don't know any agencies off the top of my head that can help you, but i can offer this.    when everything collapses, music has always been there for me. one band in particular; Circa Survive. it's uplifting, feel good music. look them up. drown your sorrow and fear in song and celebrate life.     be happy with yourself|`|EhftIc1haa	I know the feeling. I'm 15 too, and I just lost 50 lbs...my mom is just finally realizing that i'm not her little girl anymore and that I need some space and I need to do my own shopping. Tell her this...she may be doing it because you are her little girl, or maybe she thinks she's doing it for your own good. I dont know. just bring it up with her and make sure your very mature about it.|`|hCX1dTuUaa	she is protecting you|`|853ca4846c294af1ab144a923156ddb0aa	Just get your own money and go shopping with some friends or by yourself. If it's your money, you can buy what you want. If it's her money, then she can decide what it will be spent on. You don't even need "a job" like working in a store or a restaurant. Just babysit or tutor or something. The best jobs are the ones where you can sit there and study, then get paid for it. Then your parents can't even say it interferes with school.|`|7pBvgJ65aa	she a bit**|`|AA12115728	The fact that you say your mom harrasses y ou about your weight and makes you cry is kind of a red flag, but there's no way to be sure without seeing the two of you in action.    So what I think you should do, if possible, is talk to another adult in person - do you have a school counselor?  (not the kind that just give vocational advice, but someone you could talk to about a problem like this).    Other than the harrassment part, this kind of thing happens a lot between mothers and daughters for some reason.  They project their own insecurities onto their female children, and all the girl wants is to be accepted for who she is by her female role model. Sad, isn't it?  My mother was obsessed with my hair.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It is possible that you may of conceived, your symptoms do lead to pregnancy, early on in my first i experience really sore boobs, backache and nausea.  Everyone experiences symptoms at different times in pregnancy.    For the bleeding, my step mum had nearly the same as you, she had lighter bleeding, just like a period, for around 3-4 days and that was actually implantation bleeding for her, and she didn't think it was at the time.    Hope this information helps, best of luck xxx
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	wow you got 2 crappy answers. have you tried rocking him instead of nursing? or have dad rock him. he will get use to going longer without nursing, though my 13 month old still wakes up to nurse, its more like 3 times a night now.  I co-sleep too so its not that big of an inconvenience, you just have to pop a boob out really.     try kellymom.com, Ive always gotten helpful advice from that site|`|WhGN5ZvKaa	I have a 6 month attached as I write - lying in bed. It isn't a problem for me and I am still happy to do this when she needs to sleep. However, with your question regarding the on the hour feeding - I would suggest that this is nothing to do with the fact you feed in bed. This period of the four month growth is generally accepted to be a growth spurt time. I was in the same situation a couple on months ago with the feeding on the hour, but persevered until my production matched her needs. Have you considered this? Is the baby upset and crying more than usual? I was so tempted to introduce a bottle or solids, but on the recommendation of informed midwives I continued only breastfeeding. i am now so pleased I did and have had no more issues and have managed to provide my baby with enough milk and only now am I slowly introducing solids - which I find time consuming and expensive! My advice is to keep them on the breast if you can :)|`|i1WpKYKHaa	My son did that all the time.  I disregarded the doctor and fed him some rice cereal right before bed.  If you water it down with breast milk and put it into a bottle with a slightly larger hole it works wonders.  Just give the baby some water after every rice feeding.|`|3w7VztEWaa	you dont have to be even breastfeeding anymore 4 months is enough. you should start feeding your baby goats milk, it's really healthy for the baby. go to the health food store.|`|4qrH4pVraa	If its every hour then it may not be hunger, but he wants lots of cuddles and love. He may just be going through one of those little stages where he wants mummy close. Maybe if you can wheel his bed into your room where he is close to you, you may get a little more sleep. You could try just sitting and snuggling with him for some extra time before putting him on the boob and see if you can eventually calm him without feeding each time. He could even be teething? Its tough, but don't resort to things that are unsafe for you baby like putting food into a bottle. Maybe if you think its hunger, top him up with an extra bottle of expressed milk or formula before bed? If you think its the sucking that he's craving then try a different brand/shape pacifier?
xqp28ETVaa	My guy does the same thing....he loves to be swaddled and only seems to get to sleep that way but now that he is more active, he wiggles out and inadvertently hits himself a lot.     We purchased a velcro swaddler from Babies R Us and that works great...he can't get out and sleeps great now :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	get a 'swaddle me' by kiddopotamus; they are ten bucks at babies r us; they don't get out of them and mine slept sooo much better in one....|`|qyObFvz6aa	Yes I agree with Freya...you kind of have to just do it. My daughter was fussy for the first two weeks but after that she got used to going to sleep unswaddled. I will say though that in doing so we really developed our own bedtime routine (music, lighting, cuddling) so that she knew she would be going to bed. When we swaddled her she had to already be sleeping.  I'm sure you already have a bedtime ritual, so maybe reinforcing or enhancing it can help ease her out of the swaddler.|`|i1WpKYKHaa	If she is hitting herself she might have a headache, talk to your doctor.  As for the swaddling just put her in warm and comfortably clothes at night|`|iAGzyzRWaa	I am not sure how you put her down for her naps but I would try not swaddling her during nap time, so she gets used to it, then start at bed time, when my son starting wiggling out that is what i did, it was a little rough at first, but now he is rolling over so he rolls over and sleeps on his belly. Hopes this helps good luck!
dbcILDdSaa	Being a mom of a 7, 3 and 1 year old. My baby who is 16 months is still on the bottle, it gives her security and I am not willing to take that away yet. I have limited her bottle usage by only putting milk in her bottle not juice, her juice goes in her sippy.   I would not worry about your daughter getting too much milk, as long as she is growing, eating and drinking...there is no need to take away her milk.   My 3 year old refuses to drink any form of milk, even with a hint of syrup to sweeten the flavor, NOTHING...so I have to make sure she eats her yogurt and cheese, so that she does have her calcium another way.    Hang in there, I would do nothing your daughter obviously likes milk and that is a good thing!!|`|qFmOuXMXaa	I wouldn't change a thing other then giving her a sippy cup with all that milk. I think if she wants to drink it why not. I would start replacing one bottle feeding with one cup feeding and in 2-3 weeks she will be off the bottle all together.    Good luck, my daughter was 12 months, when one night before bed I was really sleepy or busy and I just laid her in her bed and she just turn over and went to sleep. Later that night I remember I had forgotten to give her a bottle, she never had one after that. I wish it was that easy for every one.lol|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	if she drinks it give it to her, my 14mth old has three bottles of 180mls but he is still having formula
54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	When my son was ready for one nap, he started fussing when it was time for his morning nap. When he finally did fall asleep, he'd only sleep for half an hour or so and wouldn't sleep for the rest of the day. Come 6 p.m. my little guy was dead on his feet, and in bed. Which meant he woke up again at 4 a.m.    So, I gradually started to move his naps later and later until he started taking one decent nap at around 12 p.m. Some days he'll want to nap earlier or later, but it's not such a huge impact on his bed time anymore (he's 16 months old now, and started taking one nap a day when he was 9 months old).|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	how old is she??|`|KQL3tqS7aa	Our son first took a nap at 10 and another at 3.  Once he started fighting bedtime, we cut him back to one nap and limited the time to about 1 1/2 hours.  That way, he was ready to go to bed at night!|`|PbBWJGsTaa	Mine does what yours does.  She wakes for her breakfast milk at around 6am, then sometimes is up for the day after that, and takes a morning and an afternoon nap.  Other days (most days these days), she wakes for milk at around 6 and falls right back to sleep for 2 hours.  Then she's up for the day at 8am.  She then doesn't nap till her afternoon nap.  I read that the transition occurs at around 18 months so thats what might be happening with yours.   My daughters only 9 months old, so I have no idea what she's doing.  I just try not to plan around her naps any more.  Depending on where I am she naps in her cot, in the buggy or on my lap.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My daughter just started taking one nap like the day after her 1st birthday.   It's only been a few weeks since then and what happened is she was getting tired later in the morning and then when I did try to put her down for a reg morning nap she would refuse her afternoon nap.  So I began to push her morning nap back about 1/2 to an hour until it was more like a noon nap and usually that's the only nap she takes and it's about 1.5-2 hours.    Some lucky moms have kids that take 2 naps till they are like 2 years old!
3WWHWsHOaa	I think this is fairly ridiculous. Second hand smoke in the wide open outdoors? Your already breathing all the polutants from the factories, cars, and any other buisness near the parks. Unless you are parking your child 6 inches from a smoking adult the chances of them breathing anything harmful is very minimal. Why not just make smoking illegal and be done with it? That is where we are headed anyway.    Edit: I agree with Des on the cigarette butts. It is considered littering and should be enforced much more often for cigarette butts.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I think it's a lovely thought, and a good idea to keep the children, and their parents safe from second hand smoke.|`|FGk4306faa	Yeah and they should raise the price to 30 bucks a pack!|`|tjNJAn75aa	Im a smoker and I hate having to take my son to a park with cigarette butts all over the floor so i'd say yeah In the playground definately but maybe have certain "smoking benches" kinda like theme parks do. When Im at the park, I go just outside the gates and smoke away from everyone and put my butt in the bin, The only worry is tho is how they would enforce it. Not sure anyone would listen.|`|qGQCLFinaa	I think there should be an area for smokers, away from the children & people that don't want to be around smoke, but close enough parents can still converse with their children........ When i use to smoke i always went away from people, it was my habit, not one elses!! I live in a place it's still legal to smoke in bars, my fiance smokes but i don't & i don't ever want to go out simply because i can't stand the smoke, my fiance says well it's the only place we can smoke at still & i say, go OUTSIDE!!!     I think everyone has the right to choose, & there should be designated areas for smoking|`|5D0KuT74aa	public  public means for EVERYONE  even smokers|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	where im from smoking is banned in ALL public places, its awesome!!!  think its a great idea!|`|NITJ2A0Saa	I think it sounds like a good idea. Maybe a certain area could be set aside for smokers.|`|RHEcNYn6aa	Personally, I think that is a *great* idea. I would love that, but i'm not sure if my local area's going to do that. When i take my younger cousins/nieces/nephews to the parks theres' always one or more parents smoking.|`|Bo11l8xQaa	I think it should be. It harms children who should be going to the park to get nice, healthy exercise.|`|hEC87Vj8aa	yes that is a good idea but i also think that there should be a special place set aside for smokers since they just cant quit|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	Especially parks where kids go. Better yet ban cigarettes. I remember being pregnant and had to smell it just because they happen to be around. We all have a right to coexist in this only planet. But seriously why be part of the problem when you can be part of the solution.|`|v070sAApaa	i think it would be a great idea i dont want my daughter exposed to that...shes allergic to it so i gotta be careful|`|bNvChlo9aa	I definitely agree with that! My son has asthma and secondhand smoke is very harmful to him.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i don't know how bad the second hand smoke risk really is in a park.  but i would support a law making it illegal to dump cigarette butts all over a public park.  that's disgusting and unsanitary and a fire risk.  if people want to smoke they should be responsible for taking care of their own litter.|`|capqMpiCaa	I bet it wont be passed cause people will get into an uproar claiming its "violating their freedoms" but cmon theyre killing themselves anyway. I think it's a great idea to ban smoking in public parks, expecially for the children, it's horrible to think people are willing to risk children's health for their own selfish self destructive habits.|`|jdVxsK4yaa	NO   dats stupid|`|76Wp8OINaa	Not a smoker but I'm fiercely against this idea, we should not take away smoker's rights anymore.|`|0sw9nrcpaa	i liv in britain where its been banned in public places. shockin idea wats the point, parks arent gunna be lik second hand smokin so y ban it??|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think it is a god idea but to be honest...we are breathing in second hand smoke every time we step outside.|`|AA11570752	stupid..... can they ban farts too?|`|1D2UiAJeaa	same as the first answerer. public places ban smoking where i live.

ZRNlwu5laa	Unfortunately rectal and I HATED having to do this but our pediatrician said it was the most accurate as infants up to a few months is age. After that we used the ear thermometer (reads in 3 seconds, it is great and accurate).|`|kGFtUZaiaa	the most accurate place to take a temperature is by Rectal-- use the old glass/mercury kind|`|hrMhhB4Saa	im not sure which brand thermometer. but the best places to take a temp. is rectal. under the armpit is pretty accurate also
HFA05vDuaa	well its different for everyone but ill give you my feelings.  When i am in love i think about him all the time laugh in the middle of anything about something we/he did because we wer etrying to impress each other listen to songs that only remind me of him look at picturesr of us and finally always be myself around him|`|A3zAXntxaa	You just know, it's like unconditional. No matter what, and you love every minute with the person, even the hard moments, you still love them, no matter what. I failz at describing stuff, especially that I've never experienced, but that's my take on it. (:|`|KwJDWvB3aa	cant be described properly..|`|wqRwSaGSaa	cant really be decribed.  most amazing feeling every day  you can be mad as hel l at the person and still love them.  its just great.|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Like you need to with them.  You have a connection.  You have stuff in common (or none at all, but that makes you two perfect for eachother!!)  You both have said I love you  You just know he/she is the right one.
Bhy4k9wPaa	Sounds like what i had when I was pregnant with my youngest-carpal tunnel syndrome. I'd struggle to grip the door handle sometimes-it seemed worse when I got up in the middle of the night or early in the morning. It's just one of those things that pregnant women are prone to due to their muscles doing all sorts of crazy things and isn't necessarily from being on the computer at all.    Your best bet is to wear a support bandage on your hand during the day (take it off for the night) but other than that, all the doctor will suggest is physiotherapy. But bear in mind it will go after you've had the baby. Mine went within a week of having my son. And booking physio may take longer than the 4 weeks you have left!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Do you have GD? I'd ask your doctor to check you over again. But another thought. Do you type on the computer a lot? Could be carpal tunnel..    _edit_  Oh hehe. Gestational diabetes. Sometimes diabetics can have cramping or numbing in their hands and feet. Usually due to low electrolytes.
DAHBFQx6aa	Before I found out I was pregnant I would have dreams about babies and sometimes little goldfish {Old ppl say when you dream about fish somebody's pregnant, if the fish have teeth, it's twins}. But I thought maybe that was because I had a passion for babies and wanted one really bad. Anyways, I'm pregnant now and I still have dreams about little babies, only now they're a little more realistic. Everyone I know that's been pregnant has had dreams about their baby also.. BUT, that doesn't mean you are.. Just wait a few weeks and take a test. Good luck|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	I Have been having a dream that i can feel about the baby moving. I'm due for my period on the 11th but don't know maybe i am Update me if you are this will be my 2nd baby!  Baby dust to you!|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	go to this website! i believe everything on it. it says everything in a dream has a purpose on why you dreampt about it.. i already have the link on the page that  will describe why you dreampt of a baby just scroll down.     hope this helps!!

AA11664585	its true some certain ones can help with clearer skin but it depends on your body chemistry too! a downfall is sometimes you can gain some extra weight, but just keep track in the back of your mind if your eating habits are changing!|`|zt20nLKhaa	It will regulate your period.  It can be awfully nice to know just when it's going to start so you can plan accordingly.    For me, it also made my periods lighter and shorter, with less cramps.|`|LABC73E7aa	shorter, lighter periods.|`|DAHBFQx6aa	It depends on what form and kind of birth control you're gonna be using. They're all different with different ppl, some will do you good and some will make you hate the world.. Like the shot, my cousin got it a while back and claimed she very rarely had a period and didn't gain any weight or lose any hair {lol, i don't think u lose hair fa*real though}.. and a friend of mine started using it and had a period for 2 months, she was always hungry and she gained a lot of weight, and her face broke out. Doctors usually recommend YAZ! but that doesn't work for everybody either. So yea, it all depends on what type you use and what kind of benefits you're looking for. Good luck!!|`|EPVWrEOxaa	i think yaz helps give you clear skin. bc also helps get rid of cramps every month and gives you a regular period
lXE75yQjaa	Hmm...this would not bother me (my oldest daughter is 12) but everyone is different I guess. I think you just need to be straight with her, and tell her that it's gotten kind of past it's prime.  Really to have a throw rug for that long is pretty good. I'm lucky if I can get a year out of mine with pets, kids, etc.   Simply roll it up and place it in your closet...really, I think she will understand. Or ask her if she could get it dry cleaned for you..that's a thought. Might help her see that its really not in the greatest shape.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Just be honest with her . Explain that it is rally messy and you really just want a change.|`|ZKHaLbdEaa	I'm truley sorry for your lots of mucous rug.|`|2d8c6f27c3437723163ff69e22f22598aa	yea....just wash it. i really dont think she'll mind|`|kDvKc3npaa	just say:  Mom you know that purple rug you got me?  Well its gotten pretty dirty and really hard to clean, do you think i could put it up for a while, it makes my room look dirty|`|A3zAXntxaa	Ah, you have to be honest, you could say something like.  "Mom, my rug is getting really gross and matted, do you mind if I move it somewhere."     She probably won't mind very much, but it's okay, so just tell her. (:  And good for youu for being so thoughtful about it, you're worrying about her feelings that's really sweet. Ha. (:|`|cJ1hizgHaa	how about washing the rug.....|`|6uRWoIjJaa	Just be open with her and tell her you feel like a bit of a change, try having the rug professionally cleaned..|`|Ut3N1SyYaa	Get the rug professionally cleaned or talk to your mom about it, and about all the disgusting things on it.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Tell your mom you love the rug so much and it's beautiful but it's causing your room to be messy and it's getting a little gross. Tell her that it would be a good idea to find a similar rug that doesn't get gross as easy and lasts longer.|`|0cgAzc3Uaa	Just talk to her about it when she is in a good/relaxed mood, like casually watching tv or reading.   And say something along the lines of:  "Mom, I know you spent a lot of money on the rug in my room, and it's not that I don't appreciate it, because I do. But the rug is over two years old, and all the traffic and stuff in my room gives the rug the appearence of being dirty. It makes me feel uncomfortable in my room, and I was wondering if I could put it away for a while."      Hope this helps!|`|UxMugqdraa	cover it, clean it, cut it. Do something|`|OT8TMTOHaa	Just bin it.  Next time tell her that your room is so messy because of the rug and that you want rid of it.  She shouldn't complain because then your room will be clean.|`|AUK3lzEbaa	Saying it as nice as POSSIBLE! I mean, the truth hurts, give her tough love, don't make her start flailing about it, just say, "Mom, things keep getting tangled in the shag of my rug, MAY you get me a new one?"
PLK1p8cUaa	You may have some external bruising or even bruising inside.  You should mention this to your doctor.  Most likely it will go away on it's own but if there is cramping or bleeding let your doctor know as well.|`|YH46aQCtaa	If I were you I would go talk to my regular doctor about that and see what they have to say!
MyUx7Bp0aa	Yep! My little cousin's name is Jessa, I also like Jenna and Jessica.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	yes, very cute and different|`|xLabGD6Maa	Not a fan.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	yes that's gorgeous!  i would totally name my daughter jessa but we have our faves already picked out :)|`|jU80mmJraa	its ok|`|5HGDhEjyaa	I like that name, but I would use as a middle name.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Jessica is better.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	yea|`|vlwzVbbBaa	No it sounds incomplete and made up but Jessica is really pretty|`|OWONPvlsaa	I think it's nice and different. It's kind of like jessica with a few letters missing but in a time when everyone is going for unique, I think it's good but not too off base.|`|Sy1R6caeaa	I think it's a pretty good name. I prefer either Jenna or Jessica but it's a pretty name either way! :)|`|zFwjZy53aa	no|`|NbbRCxwxaa	yes i like|`|7rK2NOqoaa	its ok|`|8zNhcdpjaa	Honestly, I'm not crazy about it.  It sounds like a nick-name for Jessica.  It might be hard for people to remember it or teachers to pronounce it because it is so different.
zhJOZhKEaa	Perfectly normal.  This page has a lot of info on breastfeeding and fertility/periods: http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/fertil...  There is even a chart that shows the *wide* variation of 'normal' return of a breastfeeding mother's periods.    Hope that helps!    ETA: "way back in the 12th century, women used breast feeding as a form of birth control"  LOL... and some of us still do today!  I used ecological breastfeeding (described in the site above) alone as birth control between my  2 &  3 and between  3 &  4.  It works great up until the return of your period... mine tend to return at about 8 months postpartum.  My babies were spaced at 17 month between births and 22 months between births with no other birth control.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Calm down hunny, its fine. I only just got mine this week and my daughter is 9 months. A friend of mine has a 11 month old and she hasnt got hers yet either, and we are both breastfeeding too. If your son is only 8 months he wouldnt have dropped a feed yet so its very normal.|`|mdyuUjDxaa	Girl I hope you know by now that all us Women are all created differently in our own special way. You''ll have your periods again soon...But the cramps might get more intense bcuz thats what happens after baby. Just enjoy the time you have now...It will come b4 you know it...    Love, Denae|`|mWZE7gF7aa	I am not quite sure if there is a 'normal' time period for this, but a friend of mine didn't get her period for 9 months after her daughter was born...and I was reading that some people can go as long as a year without a period.  If it is concerning, you can ask your doctor, but I don't think it is abnormal.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	i didn't start my period for 10 months after my son was born (actually just this monday!).  anyway, i thought it was a long time too and called my nurse, she said it was fine and each woman is different.  alot of women don't even start until after they are completely done breastfeeding.  she said only to worry if i stop breastfeeding and it doesn't start back, then she said to come in and they could "jump start it".|`|j9Xx8syQaa	Took me about 11 months before I got a period back after all three of my kids. Don't know how you mean overies feel strange... your body will usually be a little different after a baby. If you are worried talk to a doctor, but it sounds pretty normal.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I got my period back around 6-7 months with my older kids.  My baby is only 5 months now and no AF yet.  Some women get it early like me, and some never have a period the whole time they're breastfeeding.|`|rxk90e6Taa	I was told after giving birth my period would probably be a no-show as long as I continued to breastfeed. I was so happy. But my period returned 12 weeks after I gave birth although I continued to breastfeed. So I don't know what is normal. Different people with different hormones,etc. I can't imagine why you'd want your period though. I know I enjoyed not having mine for at least 3 months after giving birth.|`|lG2hdAQDaa	Actually, yes, that is very normal. In fact, way back in the 12th century, women used breast feeding as a form of birth control. However, if you're feeling odd, I would definitely go visit your doctor to make sure everything is ok. Your instincts should be trusted.|`|BkatcMZbaa	I am not a doctor or specialist in this field but I had some learning lessons on how to help those who have their monthly lady sickness & pain ......all from the Soulim physician in China.    It sound quite abnormal and you don't feel the discomfort & you didn't consult your doctor for months.....is strange to me.  Please do yourself a favour by visiting your specialist for an answer, be quick.. & not from here as it is too serious and too dangerous for non-concerned people to do concerned thing.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I only nursed part time till my son was 7 months old and then we stopped and it took 3 more months for my period to start again.  I wouldn't worry about it once you stop it will start up again... just enjoy the time off without having to be pregnant!!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	totally normal....especially if you are still breastfeeding at night. I did not get a period until my "baby" was 15months old.
UxMugqdraa	YEA! You feel it too? Since most of us are the same i think u should just go with what you feel.     Don't you hate when u like a guy and ur friend likes him too. (ur friend doesn't know u like him)|`|LynprVLYaa	OMFG! I get the same feeling with this guy that I used to like! I just be nice to him and I talk to him and stuff.
Tf0WM1WMaa	well it seems to me like your the only one keeping the conversation going. and like hes just being a friend. If he liked you he would text you often and try to get your interest by flirting, until you've experienced the flirting with him, he doenst like you.    btw dont talk to guys about girl drama, they really dont care lol.|`|gCiJpRfwaa	That reminds me how I talk to some girls I know. I'm friends with them, but I do think they're dateable as well. But I really think of them as friends first.|`|UxMugqdraa	over looking it. trust me. i thought the same way then looked like a fool. Some guys also thought i liked them then they looked like a fool. It turns out that we may flirt without realizing. I flirt a lot without knowing.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	I think your probably over analyzing. I'm sorry. I do that all the time. And I hate being the one to start the conversation, too ://|`|Rqh8VILgaa	over analying:(  srry:/|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	No i really don't think he does, i'm sorry. Seems to me like he was just being a good friend.
j4qoVnofaa	i heard it can double in one day 24 hours.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	am not sure myself also but i know it does double every 24 to 48 hours
DNUPVvioaa	you didn't just hit your girlfriend you hit you baby as well.  that was very wrong but i can understand it.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	You need professional help. It's not appropriate to injure your girlfriend at any time. There is no such thing as a "moment of madness."    So grow up and become an adult, you are going to be a father soon.    Pregnancy is a difficult time for any woman. You can either be a man and step up to the plate and be there for her and your baby or be a man, walk out the door now and make arrangements to send money. Make a decision and stick with it, your girlfriends future well being and your child's safety is at stake.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Grow the **** up! I hope she leaves your sorry ***!!!|`|WxEmrNAOaa	just apolgise and tell her it was a moment of madness and promise it wont happen again and make sure it doesnt!! just remember her hormones are everywhere and she will be extremely tired and emotional. she needs your support. just be there for her x|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Pregnancy is truly hard for women we have hormones that we don't understand and mood changes.  We feel lonely most of the time and I know it is hard on the partner as well.  Maybe you should try and not have friends over too late so she can rest you have to put yourself in her shoes.  Maybe try one of those empathy bellies and see how it feels to carry the extra weight and you know she could just want some attention from you.  If your anger is a real problem I would try therapy and try not to blow your steam off by hitting her it isn't the right choice.|`|tsPGVVWcaa	WOW! If you were my boyfriend i would leave you. Not because you accidentally hit me but because you seem selfish and all about your self. She is 7 and 1/2 months pregnant you should be supporting the way she feels and not disrespecting her by doing what you want. When will men learn??|`|VUss5AfAaa	just talk with her..tell her you are very sorry but you were angry.  you have to have time for yourself before the baby gets there because then you cant be hanging out much with friends.  take her out on a date...tell her how much she means to you and how scared you are before the baby arrives..how all this is going to change for both of you!..let her know how you understand how shes feeling.    goodluck.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	I think you need to grow up and learn some manners, she's almost 8 months pregnant, and she said no one over late, and you did it anyway, you hurt her, your drinking, you have problems. get some help before she really does leave you.|`|ISS2UXAHaa	wow... she is pregnant and EMOTIONAL... of course she cries all the time... all she wants is you to be with her... you chose your friends over your gf and your unborn child...|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	There is absolutely NO excuse for hitting a woman - a pregnant one at that!!!!  What kind of father are you going to be?!?! Are you going to hit the baby if she/he annoys you or cries???    You need help - and she needs to leave you, for the safety of your child!!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	don't worry about it. my boyfriend and i argue about the same exact ****. we're still young and he lives with his roomie and they have parties and i throw a fit!     anyway, if you didn't intentionally hit her then don't worry :) but if you did, then you're a p.o.s :)    if you're worried about the baby, i'm sure he/she is alright     good luck!|`|kyTDQEWaaa	I it were me, you'd be history, baby or not.  There is no excuse for hitting anyone, much less your pregnant girlfriend.   Either get counseling or get out.   She's hormonal and bitchy, its not her fault.  Pregnancy is very hard and you if you can't live without your friends for awhile, then you are a jerk.  You made that baby, too.   You have to sacrifice.|`|MqFeJiukaa	You need to do some growing up.  You really have no clue how to be a good boyfriend.  I don't think at 7 months pregnant she is asking to much of you.  You prob should strongly consider not drinking period.  What happens when the baby comes are you really going to think it is ok to have people over drinking all hours of the night?!  Not to mention you hit her.  That is NEVER ok pregnant or not pregnant.  I think you need to get some anger management.  It does not matter if it is in the moment or not.  What happens in the heat of the moment when your baby is crying for hours on end and you lose your temper?|`|JJCSEe3Taa	I have a question not an answer I'm afraid:    How on earth did she manage to fall for you in the first place?|`|YseGAHIfaa	you are a serious loser. your girlfriend's emotions & hormones are out of whack so she can't help being emotional & tired. it's bad enough hitting a woman at all - but your pregnant girlfriend? you have made it clear to her that you'd rather spend time with your friends rather than your family so i wouldn't be surprised if she dumps you - [coz that's what you deserve] instead of being a coward & a sorry excuse for a man, you should of told your friends to leave & spend time with your child & girlfriend. when you jumped into bed with her & created an innocent life, you should have thought about how much you'd ruin your "social life". it's a shame that you didn't spend more time practicing how to use a condom instead of spending time with your friends. it's time to be a man & a role model to your child, don't you think?|`|UB4J9dtMaa	You can make it better by going and getting a life.  You don't deserve her.  Grow up, work on your issues, You need to understand the emotional stress that she is under.  Only then will you be able to deal with being a responsible father to your child - please remember that.|`|NCa8bOjSaa	You didn't respect her wishes to not have people over late even though she expressed them clearly beforehand.      She reacted in the obvious way.    You were insensitive to her feelings, and were physically aggressive with her.    You should be begging for her forgiveness right now instead of looking for some sort of consolation here.|`|KxBPpzgIaa	you need to get help you are an ******** just like my bf. i am 7 weeks preg and he threatened to hit me 4 days ago i left him until he gets couseling. she will leave you eventually too|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	you know inside what you did and if it was damaging.  you need to talk to her and get some stress management classes.|`|UmqLkwAraa	Well first off ur girl wants to spend time with u thats what u need to do. When shes crying be there and hold her and tell her its going to be ok. Don't Ignore her thats not right u love someone ur there for them. Shes going to be tired shes carrying a baby u wouldnt know notting about that. Dont push her away from u if you love her enough u will do the right thing and spend more time with her then ur guys i told my husband the same thing we have 3 kids together. Hes staying up late and playing games are over i dont get to have fun well either does he. U are lucky to have a girl like that i would of left ur *** a long time ago. My man ever hit me i would stab him. AM BOSS no man runs me. GOOD LUCK fell sorry for that baby hope she stays away from ur drunken a$$.|`|JzEDl2Xqaa	YOUR SICK! HITTING A PREGNANT WOMEN! GOD YOUR A SICK PERSON! GET A LIFE THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE GETTING WEMON OR PREGNANT WEMON!!!!! YOU IDIOT!!!!!|`|vrn1Dhulaa	I dont know the whole story, or her side either... but just from this... you guys NEED to get counseling. Or at least you do. Don't take offense to that.     If you can't hadnle her crying and neediness, you won't be able to handle a baby's, and that's scary!
M8s1MYsUaa	you poor thing, and i mean that.  it's so hard, and for the next few weeks, it's only going to get harder.  now this is what i used to do, it may not make sense, but anyway.  anytime after 37 wks, it's safe to have the little one. as long as this pregnancy is normal, no complications.  so in my mind i would think, only 3 more wks.  then as much as i hated it and as hard as it was, i would do as much cleaning, walking, moving..... as possible.  and the part i hated the most, as much sex as possible.  i also thought in terms of wks, not days.  it takes getting used to, but if it was monday, i wouldn't think when is it going to be monday again, instead of is this day over yet.  there were times that at my appt. the doc would tell me i was 34 wks, and i would think i was only 33.  just because women are to be the one caring a child, doesn't mean all women do it gracefully.  you can do this, your baby knows you can, even if you don't.  i'm sry to hear about the nightmares, i dealt with them too.  it wasn't till my 3rd that i was able to control them. through meditation, and learning the ability to control my dreams.  there are alot of books on the subject.  your baby already loves you for doing this.  squish it's cheeks for me when it comes. good luck.|`|WQR0KEqZaa	believe me, you will have your baby and forget about it all, my baby is 4 weeks old and all over xmas i  thought she would never arrive and now i have a brill baby girl.  hold in there and take one day at a time.  good luck|`|AA11164125	i know exactly how ur feeling i'm so happy and excited but i'm in constant pain from pubic symphasis i'm not sleeping n i'm finding it increasingly difficult to do the most simple of things i can't bend so my partner has to help me put on socks before he leaves for work in the mornings and even things like loading the dishwasher are impossible. i dropped my housekeys on the floor the other day and couldnt pick them up so i ended up locked in my house til my OH finished work i'm so down i just want the baby to come so i can do simple things like getting in and out of the bath and picking things up from the floor again i hope the next few weeks dont get u down too much just focus on how happy u will be wen u hold ur baby in a couple weeks time thats what i'm doing!!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I'm 32, weeks, and i reached that stage long ago.. I really have enough of being pregnant.. I love my babies and i love them moving, but i really think i'm at the end of my tether.. I have morning sickness still, crap indigestion, rib pain, spend my life on the loo, back pain, pelvic pain, cramps, headaches, dizziness, crap balance, always exhausted, and i can't sleep comfortably anymore. I'm averaging 3 hours a night and it's taking its toll.  I just want it over.. I was sobbing pathetically on my poor hubby's shoulder last night, that i dont think i can stand it anymore.. Which made me feel even worse because i know he feels helpless watching me in pain, and not being able to take it away. My husband makes my life so easy, and he's fantastically amazing, but i really am sick to death of feeling so bad..|`|jyseac8eaa	Oh yeah you'll get better!    good luck!  everything will be fine|`|AJEuBK1Laa	im not really an expert but if you do the math your almost done! Just a little bit longer and you will have a cute kid in you arms!|`|9fw30IQcaa	You are making a human being.  You need to be patient!  I know it's hard, can you imagine how hard it was for the woman that just gave birth to octuplets?  You don't have that much longer to go.. most likely the weather where you are at is not 96 degrees or higher, and if this is such a wanted baby, it's just part of the waiting game.  You have come so far, you are almost there!  Nightmare are a nasty part of being pregnant, but when you hold your baby in your arms, the discomfort, the memories of that 9 months seems to go in an instant.    Chin up and good luck!|`|Zk9zH5Feaa	i know how you feel :) i felt the same way. MISERABLE!!! but im sorry to say your just going to have to suck it up and deal with it cause that baby isnt going anywhere until 6 more weeks. BUT just keep thinking of how your baby is growing and getting stronger everyday and will soon be in your arms. its the best feeling in the world. and soon you will forget all about how uncomfortable you were.    GOOD LUCK! and CONGRATS!!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I know how you feel I am 33 weeks pregnant and feel the same way. I am very happy that I am pregnant and wouldnt change it for anything but I cant wait until it is time for the baby to come. I am miserable and just want my little angel here. So I know how your feeling.|`|JsEd4H0raa	your almost there. hanging in there. the baby will be here before you know it. just remember you will be up even earlier when the baby is here. Hang in there hun.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I know what you mean - im only 27weeks but counting down till its over!!! I have had REALLY low blood pressure and therefore unable to do anything without passing out, i have already been in labour twice, had many scares with bleeding, bub not moving etc...... I havent enjoyed being pregnant at all (unfortunately, as i was hoping it would be a great experience)  At least it wont last forever, and it all worth it when you finally have your gorgeous bub in your arms.  Good luck|`|O7nyzkGdaa	i have felt the same way and believe me it gets worse. I am 39 weeks and everytimei go to the doc they say i havent changed. Today she finally said that next week at my appointment we are scheduling my induction, and its going to be the longest week ever! Just try to get through it, all pregnant women feel the same way, i did, and now i know that she WILL be here eventually, and hopefully sooner than later|`|MqFeJiukaa	I hate to sound negative but it does not get better until your baby is in your arms BUT it will be worth it.  I am 35 weeks and I am right there with you.  I also have sciatica and some nights I can not sleep.  I have been doing pelvic tilts, stretches and warm baths.  Some times it helps and some times it don't but I have to admit the more I do my stretches and take my walks it really does make me feel better.  I also feel super heavy and going through the whole I feel so fat thing.  Everyone wants the baby out at this phase but we have to just get through it for the health of our babies.  I had my 2nd at 34 weeks and she had to spend 3 weeks at the hospital and it was pure agony.  Just try to hang in there and stay strong for your baby.  Best of luck to you!!|`|RSw7bP3Maa	First of all congrats, but don't worry hun, it's normal. Try to get some books on baby to get you busy, go to the mall, try to get yourself busy.  But do not forget to rest, you'll be the happiest once the baby is here is does really worth everything single pain.|`|7qCUk8hfaa	After its is all over. just think how big your fupa! will be|`|5iOQ4VyFaa	No it doesn't get any better.  It will get physically and mentally worse for you.  When the baby is born your whole life will change.  You will not have time for yourself anymore.  It will be very hard for a few years but once the child can take care of itself it will get better.  Hope this helps!|`|wy5SiCS2aa	aw I'm sorry that you're having a rough time. I know how you feel, I was 10 days overdue with my son-the baby will come when he or she is ready to live outside the womb, nature knows best. That's no comfort but it's the best I have. Ask your doctor if there's anything he or she can do to help alleviate some of the pain, and schedule an induced labor if you can. My son came 3 days before my induction, but it made me feel better just knowing I had a set date that I could mark on my calendar that the baby was going to come out FOR SURE no matter what. Cherish this time and try to get as much sleep as you can, even if it's during the day, because once that child comes you won't get ANY sleep for a while!|`|X2eVfKc6aa	I posted the same Q last week!  Im 35 weeks feel exactly the same, I feel soo bad for you.  I cant sleep till early hours of the morning and then i cant get up till the afternoon, i have the same pains down below and im huge!  It does get better tho! everyday you just gotta think its a day sooner to seeing your beautiful baby.  Good luck! xxxx
YJNql5Mgaa	Hm... with a bicornuated uterus you're never really out of the clear but many women go on to have perfectly normal pregnancies and labors.   So don't worry. :)
2nfMSDiPaa	Hun I think Its Implantation bleeding    What is implantation bleeding?    Implantation bleeding occurs when a fertilised egg attaches itself to the wall of the womb.    During implantation the tissue surrounding the fertilised egg burrows into the endometrium (the lining of the uterus), forming links with the mother's blood supply and body tissue that will gradually develop into the baby's lifeline for the next 9 months, the placenta. It is during the attachment process that a small amount of blood may be released.    What does implantation bleeding look like?    Most women report experiencing implantation bleeding as light spotting that's either light pink or brown in colour. Unlike menstruation it tends only to appear over a period of one - three days and is usually intermittent rather than a regular flow that becomes heavier over time.    When does it occur?    Implantation bleeding tends to occur before menstruation is expected, this is usually between six and twelve days after ovulation. Most women experience menstruation approximately 14 days after ovulation however this will depend on your individual cycle.      I hope you get the result you want!!    take care|`|V3SKrq9haa	Of course his is a big think to be concerned about|`|XhIYAH6Laa	the light period could have been implantation bleeding...have you taken a pregnancy test yet? if not you should go ahead and take one. If it negative you may want to schedule an appointment with your OB just to ease your mind. If you have recently started birth control that could also make your periods a little screwy. Good luck!    Some women do not experience any other symptoms for another couple of weeks. I would go ahead and test.
ZrIl3PwLaa	only when it is 3 am and my 3 year old won't sleep in her bed LOL JK I love my daughter more than anything and couldn't imagine life without her it wouldn't be worth living.    congrats on your daughter!!!|`|185eb50393051dd4ae601a37cf4949cfaa	I have one and love her to bits and pieces she is my world. No regrets|`|qGQCLFinaa	I have one, I could never regret him, i get stressed out & over whelmed at times but never regretful, I wouldn't trade him for ANYTHING!!|`|cz9dogpvaa	i have nine kids and one on the way and i love them to death|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	Before when I was being immature and not thinking straight. Now I don't feel that way anymore. Being a parent can bring out the worst or the best in a person. I'd rather it bring out the best in me and it does. It's a process. After all, we were once kids. I'm blessed with 2 wonderful kids. They are the best thing that ever happened to me. I hope one day they can say they're very happy to have a mother like me. That would be very fulfilling.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I never ever wanted kids.      I had my 1st when I was 30 & now I have 3.      ages 8 1/2, 6 1/2, & 4.  all girls too.      NO REGRETS!!!  I love them more than anything      -Sometimes the dreams that come true   are the dreams you never even knew you had|`|AA11927140	I have two... soon to be three.  And I can honestly say I have never experienced a single moment of regret since the day my first was born.  :)|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No but I know people who do.|`|52U22fiAaa	1 and 1 on the way... i cant imagine life without her!!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I dont ever regret having them ( I have three) but sometimes I regret staying home with them... :)  I think some time apart would do wonders.. Most of the time I love it but then there are these long winter days with horrible weather and we are all stuck inside for days....|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	There was a time that I regretted my decision to have another baby.  We already had 4 and I decided that I wanted just one more.  My husband agreed and soon enough, I was pregnant.  My regret happened when the doctor informed us that our "one" more was going to be "three" more.  We were having triplets (no fertility treatments either!).  I really wondered what I had gotten us into.  I wondered how we would almost double the size of our family.  I wondered what it would do to our relationships with our other kids.  It was not what we had planned on.    It took about a week for us to digest the news and accept that this was what was going to happen to our family. We started to look forward to this.  Really, how many people get to have this in their family?  We realized that it really was a good thing and the regret turned to excitement.  I wanted another newborn to cuddle, I was sure going to get my arms full!  By the time they were born, they were welcomed into the family with open arms.  On that day we went from 4 kids to 7 and decided not to tempt fate again.  I'm not going to ask for another "one" - who knows how many I'd get!
aQ8o4w3Xaa	It's not really because you're breaking the hymen. That can easily be done before you first have sex and you won't notice much. The reason it hurts is because you're being stretched out.    It's like blowing up a balloon. When you first try to blow it doesn't quite work and it can take a few times before it easily stretches to the right shape. Then, after a few puffs, it easily blows out into shape and becomes normal. Think of it like that. It will take a few times until your vagina has stretched and opened enough so that it isn't put under pressure.     When you first have sex, be relaxed and don't think too much. That will only make you tenser, which will make it hurt more. Invest in some lube, such as KY jelly. That will really ease the process and make it better for both people. Make sure adequate foreplay has taken place first. It will prepare you and make it easier. If you jump straight in, it will hurt you far more.    Good luck!  :)|`|r39EDGhPaa	You're practically a baby.    But yes it hurts.  It's a piece of skin that's being torn, of course it hurts.  And yes sex will still hurt, your vagina isn't used to having things in it and it will stretch.|`|YseGAHIfaa	yes, it will hurt but you probably will not bleed.   you're only 13 so please stick to being a kid before you want to jump into losing your virginity!    =)  x|`|ISS2UXAHaa	you are way to young to even know what a hymen is|`|oQDQSSSDaa	Well, I'm a virgin too. A lot of my friends are not virgins and they have told me it hurts a lot when you have sex. It will make you bleed a little.  If your not ready to have sex then don't do it. Plus, you're way too young.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	it is skin being broken so it most likely will hurt...i'm not sure if it will hurt if it's already broken though. if it's not broken then it probably will bleed.|`|L0873cdDaa	You are too young to be worried about this.|`|DskzIKhnaa	first of all, not every girl has a hymen,   if bleeds, it wont bleed alot, just a little,   & not everyone bleeds.  sex will prob not hurt, but it may.  but its not excruciating pain.|`|4pMcFTNAaa	SInce u broke ur hymen in may only hurt for just like 3 seconds well thats how it was with me when i had sex at 16. I also didnt bleed, but the next day my period came on.|`|AUK3lzEbaa	first of all, not every girl has a hymen,   if bleeds, it wont bleed a lot, just a little,   & not everyone bleeds.  sex will prob not hurt, but it may.  but its not excruciating pain.  enjoy it.  you're too young to worry about this, babe.  if you want to have it,  ok,  fine,  whatever,  be safe though  best of luck, babe|`|yKzl64gtaa	you are wayy to young to be worried  trust me   wait till marriage.|`|RPNFS0U9aa	No she is not to young to be worrying about her hymen! The hymen can break in other ways then sex, if you play alot of sports that will cause the hymen to tear or if you use tampons, it's not just sex and 80% of girls hymens tear before they have sex anyway. So don't say she is too young to know becuase she is not.|`|BnX2c7aNaa	Maybe. All depends on the person. But you're 13. Don't go having sex.|`|uKg7ye4waa	yea,  i lost my v a year younger than that,  and i bled,  it hurt quite a lot and so sore..
50lIaC8zaa	My second was heavier, first was 7lb 3oz second was 8lb 10oz.

AA10912192	Keep him home and read to him and say that you will have your own "Read the Day Away".     OR    Write a note to his teacher and tell him/her that your son isnt feeling, and that if her gets worse to call you.    Hope he feels better!|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	He should stay at home.|`|bmoCpcdraa	if you send a kid to school with a fever the school will send him back than you will have to go get him besides would you like your healthy child to go to school and someone like you send a sick kid to school stop being selfish keep kid home with fever take him to doctor after a few days be a parent|`|BIqXrr9kaa	let him go to school if he is feeling up to it...but tell him if he is feeling worse go to the school nurse and let her decide|`|N6r28iGkaa	Go to the school nurse and tell her to give him his medications during the day. Put tissues in his pocket and kiss and a hug and it'll be fine.
C6oTOvOMaa	Squats, LOTS of walking and LOTS of walking up and down stairs  Have sex and let the semen remain inside of you for at least 30 minutes or so, get on all fours and rock back and fourth...Good luck, I hope u get your wish to deliver naturally =)|`|VUss5AfAaa	not sure you know spanish but tea de clavos.. makes you have contractions..|`|AA11664585	ok honestly!!  no experience here, just suggestions. A lot of my friends try to bring there labor on early by having sex, and it seems to work, and I have also read that leaving semen/ sperm around the cervix can soften it and there fore bring on labor. Just suggesting!|`|sdHVvOm4aa	Have ur doc strip your membranes. Have them induce u instead of c section|`|xTQPiA6Yaa	Well my mom has told me about having me before.  and she has told me some things like spicy food,  Orange juice(Vitamin c in it.), and taking a walk every once in a while should help you!  I hope i helped!  and congrats on your baby!  i hope you both will be happy and healthy!    If your allergic to it then dont eat it lol|`|DAHBFQx6aa	Take a spoon of olive oil and do a lot of walking
ZrIl3PwLaa	yes you will want a reputable management company up front. By pass any online agency ang look through your phone book and meet with local agents who actually have offices in or near your home town.    good luck!!!|`|VMUwtGCuaa	the best ones are the companies that don;t charge a joining fee.so wot if she is pretty the amount of travelling and hard work may not be worth the fuss.|`|gmaCvh00aa	No you don't need a money-sucking agent.  Contact the modeling agencies directly.  Most of the big names have children's divisions--I know Wilhemina's children's division is simply "Wilhemina Kids".    You obviously have use of a computer, so google for their websites and find the page that tells you what you need to do.  Most of the time it is to send in some pictures.    In the end, though, you should know that no matter how cute your kid is, the ones that get the jobs are the ones who can sit there without wailing for their mothers and who can interact with other people who are not their parents.  You can have the most physically beautiful baby in the world, but if she's dull-witted or shy, they'll go for the next kid on the line.    On the plus side, if they do manage to get work, it's a nice income for their future.|`|vrwFgpNKaa	i agree with the first answer. a really reputable agency wont charge anything to have her on the books. so if she is really model material you will know. the ones that as for agency fees will take your money and you will get no work.
UaL28atDaa	I havn't been pregnant myself but I do know that this video is really helpful and has lots of useful tips. Check it out it will tell u what to look for, and good luck :)    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|VClxXNs3aa	missed period.    two lines on a pee stick.    baby.
4xDDR7c3aa	It can mean that labor is approaching, but that doesnt mean its going to happen that soon to where you need to be concerned, but then again baby will come when he or she is ready.  it would probably be a good idea if your concerned to let your ob know, especially if your experiencing signs of labor.
be5IoBEmaa	Ryker's not my style, but it isn't as if the child will suffer for the name.  Kids have all sorts of names these days, and Ryker isn't outrageous.    Very little good comes of telling someone you hate a name that they've settled on.  I'd only speak up if the name were clearly a complete disaster - Lucifer, say, or Felony.  And even then, I'd tread very, very carefully.    As for BF, that's too bad.  (I'm nursing my 3 month old as I type!)  Seriously, though, if I were going to offer to help, I'd bite my tongue on the name and see if you can't find a tactful way to bring up nursing.|`|eZKP9MhJaa	i think Ryker is a fine name|`|ZX2so3twaa	i think that's a bad name too.  maybe you could make a list of names and try to convince them to pick something that isn't so odd.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	I'm not a fan of the name Ryker but it's their baby, their choice.  Truly the name could be much worse and who knows, maybe it will grow on you.    About breastfeeding, that's a really personal choice so I wouldn't push the subject.  I understand that your background makes you an especially strong advocate, but it would be rude to bring it up again.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I love the name Ryker..    And breastfeeding is a personal choice, and none of yours since it's not your child!!|`|5sYzlAjPaa	The name Ryker isn't so bad - it is new, interesting and easy to spell and pronounce, so it is not way out there.    Very sad  about her refusal to breastfeed. With all the benefits derived from breastfeeding, i don't understand why women won't do it.|`|jU80mmJraa	i dont like the name    He should try breastfeeding  i am after everything ive heard about it|`|J2HzmgcVaa	i would be unhappy also. but it is a creative name|`|F44b2np9aa	Not breast feeding!!! NO No NO - please try to persuade her mind - it is a great time for bonding as well as helping the child's immune system! BUt you know that anyway:) Try an emphasis the bonding - it might help!    Ryker - not a terrible name - but not great how about Ryan...    Good luck!|`|oem5yEUDaa	Not your baby, not your choice. On both issues.|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	yea it sounds like a dogs name   srry :(|`|ph4Htg02aa	Ryker? Gosh that kid is going to hate his name. You're right on the name being horrible , but if you're sister doesn't want to breast feed she doesn't have to. A breastfed baby is no better than a formula fed one.|`|qWaddocQaa	You are correct. It is horrible that you think it's your business. To be honest, the name and child rearing methods are decisions that the parents are responsible for. I'm sure you will love your nephew regardless of his name or where his nutrients are derived.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	Well, the name is bad, that's the name of a jail. But the breastfeeding is her choice and none of your business really.|`|Sy1R6caeaa	Wow, I am without a doubt on your side, I'm so sorry!! Good Luck with that!|`|jlrJhCMKaa	That is one of the worst names I've ever heard!  but love the little bugger anyways....|`|j2qrOjo1aa	ryker's island|`|AXEqOEloaa	The name is awful and I think she should at least try and nurse, but no need to be unhappy about it, it is her choice.|`|0fviV0lNaa	It really is none of your business.  And breastfeeding is only slightly better!!! I was bottle-fed, and I am in perfect health, I don't have any "strained relationship" with that horrible mother with whom I did not get that wonderful bonding time that I would not even be able to remember, and I get the best grades in my year!! I agree with the facts, though.  I have a cousin who is also a lactation consultant and I know breastfeeding is better, but it obviously is not that much better.  It's not like a mother hates her child because she doesn't want to breastfeed.  Or if she wants to name him Ryker, which is not that bad a name.  I have met people with much worse.  I would think it is worse if they named him something like Bob, not Robert, Bob.  Just let her raise her own kid, okay?  I mean, obviously your brother doesn't mind...|`|vR6AwIppaa	try names that sound like ryker.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Eeww, horrible name!!  I pity you, but you can't do much when your sister-in-law is the mother!  Please continue to push for breastfeeding!!|`|5baec14131fd7b822f3da2903a188129aa	I would definitely be unhappy over the name... what are they thinking?  Though I'm all for breastfeeding (and I've nursed my kids)... it's a personal choice and you shouldn't hold judgment against someone for choosing a different route than you would have.  Since there's not much you can do about the first name, maybe you can convince your brother to use a more "friendly" middle name so that this poor kid can use his middle name when he grows up (and hopefully not live up to his name in prison).|`|KFsU0uuFaa	that is a hiddeous name. show them these comments. and i was breast fed.|`|a1fcf1571dad02fd52a7555f4c841920aa	I know of some Ryker's.  It's not that crazy of a name. . .saying that I wouldn't select it myself.  Before I had my daughter, I was repelled by the idea of breastfeeding.  While I was pregnant I decided I might try it or go half and half.   When I had her prematurely, I decided w/major pushing from lactation consultants in the hospital to breastfeed her--I pumped and fed her.  As a result I changed my mind about it being what I would do for my children.    You Sister-In-Law might have a similar experience with changing her mind.  If she asks for advise just tell her if she wants any information just ask.      In the end you need to keep your thoughts quiet,and instead focus on your role as a Sister and a Aunt.  You would be surprised how many times I didn't like/love a name and it ended up growing on me as the child became that name.|`|B52KNW7Haa	Should women breast feed?  ABSOLUTELY    Do I like the name Ryker?  Meh I have seen worse.      Should you be careful how you approach your brother's decisions?  Most definitely.  Like it or not you need to be respectful about his decisions.  By all means attempt to show your beliefs, but the moment you cross the line and come at him like he NEEDS to do what you say....You will lose him, his wife and don't be surprised if you don't get to see Ryker all that often.|`|OWONPvlsaa	I'm not a fan of the name Ryker either, although this is the first time I ever hear it.  And some woman feel uncomfortable breastfeeding or chose not to for whatever reason, but I think that everyone should at least try.   I'd probably feel the same way you do but just remember that no matter the name you will love the child just the same!|`|vlwzVbbBaa	Poor poor Innocent child|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Ryker?  Maybe it's because I'm from NY but I automatically think of Riker's Island!!  Yipes!
oem5yEUDaa	I had this also during my pregnancy. It is a mild form of carpel tunnel cause by extra fluids in your body that block off the nerves. It's completely normal and will go away after you give birth. Mine went away instantly.|`|eFQgVjTjaa	I had it with y first baby.  Its because the baby is on a nerve.  Most people dont know but your nerves control every part of your body.  when a nerve gets pinched off it can cause numbness tingling...etc..hpefully the baby will move soon and it will relieve the pressure.  But just to be safe speak with your OB at your next visit, ut I can almost guarantee that is what it is.
PQw92IGHaa	Well When you got off of the pills, was it in the middle of the package or was it at the end.  They say it takes up to 3 months for your period to regulate after being off of the pill, this doesn't mean that you cannot get pregnant in that time.      It could be that when you stopped taking the pill you immediately started but it through your body off because your hormones weren't being regulated by the pills.    Also, the pill makes you have the "normal" 28 day cycle, when most women don't have that exact cycle.  You could be on a 30 day cycle.  I would keep taking the tests to make sure that you aren't pregnant, but I would also know that it may take your body a while to get back to normal.  It took me 4 months to regulate after stopping the pill.|`|dcd11iUwaa	it usually takes 3-4 months for a contraceptive to leave your body.  anything can happen in this time.  Heavy period, spotting, light days, cramps or maybe none of the above.  id get a pregnancy test just in case, nothing is foolproof honey.x|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Your period came early on the 29th because you stopped taking the pill so you got some break through bleeding.  If you had a regular 28 cycle before going on the pill you might get a period at the end of this month but sometimes it can take a while for your period to come back after going off the pill.  It might just be going off the pill but you can test again in a week or if you still don't get it.|`|G024yAU3aa	I would guess that it is the birth control. When I went off of it in June of '08 -the same things happened to me.  Also being pregnant depends on how fertile you are- there is a chance that you may be pregnant, but it can take several weeks to ovulate after quiting BC.      FYI your menstrual-cycle lasts 5-7 days but you may not bleed that entire time. So that might explain all of your symptoms and the lack of blood. Your periods might be late too just because your body is trying to deal with all of the hormones it really puts it out of wack for a while.  I would give it a few more days to one week and if you still have no period take another pregnancy test.     Hope that helps!
4D1VEKW5aa	Yes its called being irregular. Ive had this off and on my whole life.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Many women have very irregular cycles, for them it's normal.  Stress, hormone problems, weight gain or loss, can also cause a woman to skip a cycle.  Also going off hormonal birth control, I didn't have any periods for a year after stopping the pill.|`|iMULlxdgaa	I thik its is possibel if your have PCOS (probably spelled that one wrong)  but I see people on here from time to time talking about it. Also hormonal changes could triugger it which is what the condition might be. Umm....besides that a lot of weight gain or loss in a short period of time. Obese women tend to lose the ability to have periods,  so do anorexic women.  Take a pregnancy test to be sure if it comes up negative she should still go see her doctor to find out why this happened to her.|`|ly59dQ3gaa	Yes, she could.  The easiest way to find out is to buy an HPT.  Cheap and effective.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes you can miss a period and not be pregnant but I am unsure of what the reasons would be besides stress, it is something she needs to talk to a doctor about.|`|780ByZVEaa	sure she could have pcos or her inner clock is just out of whack she should go to the doctor|`|n4d7rqr4aa	OOOOOOH yeah.  Stress, illness, any number of things can stop a person's period.  However, take a pregnancy test (or two) just to be sure|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yes.  Menopause, PCOS, weight gain, weight loss, extensive training, certain forms of birth control, and stress can all cause you miss your period.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes, stressing out will do it but she should take a test to be sure if she hasnt already|`|52U22fiAaa	If she's stressed, or suddenly more athletic than usual, then yes it could happen.  Also if she's on a new birth control that messes up her period.|`|u7YIC77Xaa	Yeah, your periods can stop if you are on certain meds or if you lose lots of weight.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	It really depends on the woman.  Some woman can go a few months without having a period.  Is it normal for her to skip.  Stress can also make it to where you don't have a period.  Also gaining or losing a lot of weight.|`|XOT9rHPMaa	Absolutely.  Many women will skip a period now and again.  Illness, Stress, and other factors play into this.  Also certain endocrine and hormonal issues will most certainly play a factor in irregular menstrual cycles.  If this is a common occurrence for you I would consult your doctor or get a referral to a gynecologist.  In sever cases some women will have a disorder like Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome in which more studies are needed.|`|giNlrpOZaa	Yes, Yes there are many reasons why a woman cannot have her peroiod for the longest time and not necessarily be pregnant.     I have gone up to for months without my period.   Sometimes a woman is just not ovulating- which means a short period of infertility.    Maybe it could be signs of Endometriosis- which causes lack of periods- pain- and be careful because that could lead to trouble in getting pregnant.    Stress is another thing- smoking too. You can definitely blame it on stress.    Also when there is overweight problems Also when there is an abuse of certain foods or when the woman excercises in excess- that also leads to periods not coming.    Another things could be ovarian cysts.  She should immediately go to the doctor because if it isn't any of the above- maybe her estrogen level went extremely low- and her testoterone sky rocketed. Yes- men and women have both estrogen as well as testoterone. Just that one is higher than the other based on gender.   That's what happened to me--- my estrogen level went really low causing the testoterone rise to 100% no- i didn't grow a beard or nothing- the only thing was that i wasn't ovulating so i wouldt get my period. The doctor put me on some pills that prevent miscarriage- that caused me to ovulate and some birth control pills that raised my estrogen back to normal. A year later the thing happened again- i went for three months w/o my period and i discovered something medicinal:     STRONG ALCOHOL! i had a strong drink with hypnotic mixed with bacardi rum and pineapple juice and the next morning i flushed w/ my period.|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	is she always regular or is it common for her to be irregular?  Best answer will come from a home prego test.|`|AA11575163	yes that can happen, and being stress out can also cause late period.|`|n3kewAB7aa	Sometimes a girl has irregular periods and always expects to have her period at different times but then most girls know exactly when they're going to start and that's the way it is because their period is regular... so if she never has irregular periods then she just might be pregnant.
xLZODSqOaa	Relax and stop stressing! Me and my fiance were trying for nearly a year - and you must know what the doctors say - try for at least a year before they will do anything.. August 2008 i had my last period, middle of september i was getting period symptoms (again!) and didnt think nothing of it and was disappointed, a week later i thought it was a bit strange as nothing had happened, a week later i thought why not do a test and guess what.. im now five months! just relax and stop worrying about it i found the more you stress about it the more it doesnt happen, try not thinking about it and not making sex all about 'making babies' and hopefully you'll see a result. good luck x|`|Grmsgziaaa	Hey! I know it can be so frustrating to be TTC!    Dont worry, I would get my period, and feel so bad. Or Id miss it take a test and get a -, then get my period 5 minutes later. Then out of the blue came a positive test! Dont worry, it will happen but it does take a while.  Dont worry. They symptoms are very similar to a period. Very similar.  Let us know if you get your BFP.|`|VB5midTraa	just relax! talk to a doctor, they should help you out. but remember that stress sometimes does get on the way. good luck!|`|57Hb92rGaa	First of all slow down!  Just take things easy you will fall pregnant when you lease expect it. You will not show any symptoms for a good few weeks maybe months at first. Go and speak to your GP he/she will give you more advice. Some people get their periods for weeks after they are pregnant then they will stop. Take you time and don't try so hard.  Good Luck!
9X09kM4oaa	It was the most cramped period I have ever had... get a heating pad, some tylenol, and a nice dvd- it helps|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	mine wasnt. I got mine after 7.5 months of breastfeeding. but Ive always had light and short periods.     alot of women's cycles change after having a baby though.    my baby is 13 months and Im still not regular though|`|ehmeG65gaa	have you talked to a dr about the not having a period thing? i don't think that's normal. breast feeding shoudln't effect periods|`|R2TnvAbfaa	Yes. I had my 1st period after six months of breastfeeding and it was very heavy and extremely uncomfortable.  It's normal.|`|hCX1dTuUaa	yes we have three children|`|JQZDCcyQaa	We are very similar!!! I had my daughter in April and I have been breastfeeding and I just started mine on Tuesday my first one, I was shattered!!! But I had really bad cramps all last week I knew it was coming, the bleeding was heavy the first day and I had a few lumps of blood but now its calming down. I think its very normal I mean you havent had one in a long time.
YJNql5Mgaa	If you want him to sleep there at night, start slow.  Have him sleep in it for naps.  Then after a little bit, put him in there at night. :) Good luck!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Try putting him in it for his daytime naps to begin with.  Then once he's used to that try introducing it at bedtime.|`|d3f01e98de2e5c51674e288f380af4d6aa	IF he is sleeping in his bassinet, try putting it in the crib for about a week starting when he naps. Then the next week do it during naps and bedtime for a week. After that just start putting him to sleep in his crib.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	Where is your baby sleeping now? Are you transitioning into own room from another room as well?     Establish a bedtime routine. Rock your baby, sing a lullaby, read a book, it doesn't matter, so long as you do it (almost) every night. Babies feel secure when they are put into a predictable routine.     Put baby down in his crib. Give your little guy a smooch, say "Night night" and leave the room. Don't hesitate if he begins to whimper, just go.     If baby cries...Wait 5 minutes. Allow your baby to cry for 5 minutes. It is difficult to hear your baby cry, but 5 minutes is okay. You are helping to establish boundaries for your child.       After 5 mintues and still crying..Enter the room and comfort your baby. Pat his back, tell him you love him and he's safe, and you are here. Tell him that it's bedtime and he needs to go to bed. Put on a little soft music to a timer and leave the room.|`|lCwjDDcoaa	Maybe you can move the crib right next to your bed. Or put down the shirt you wore that day on the crib before you put him down that way he still smells you while he sleeps.|`|vrwFgpNKaa	you really need  to start straight away and break the habit you already have or you are setting yourself up a few years of sleeping hell. my baby girl is 4 months she has been in her room in her cot since birth. by 6 weeks she was sleeping thru the night from 9pm to 8am. she still does it every night without fail, she has a 2-3 hour morning sleep and arvo sleep in her room also. The earlier you are the easy it will be in years to come. my sister didnt have good sleeping patterns she is still getting up to her 2 year old daughter a few times a night. no thanks!
Qm4BKE13aa	Glass bottles are BPA free. I would boil everything for at least the first few months but in a pinch washing them with hot soapy water won't hurt!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Since BPA is a chemical used in polycarbonate plastics, you should have absolutely no problem whatsoever.  The bottles you're using aren't going to be made from polycarbonate plastics, and nipples are, well, not made from plastic at all, so you don't need to worry.    You can boil-to-sterilize the nipples all you want and not have to worry about any BPA.  The only time you need to be concerned is when you're using polycarbonate plastics.    Really, though, the nipples will be sufficiently clean if you just use soap and water, but boil away if you want.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	I boiled them for my niece, but I did the rings too, since they come in contact with the drop in baggies as well. I don't know if it's a necessity, but I figure better safe than sorry for sure.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	you just boil the nipples the first time and that is it.  after that just warm soapy water.|`|dd63e8475e881a3f45f29502b473e0e8aa	you sould sterilize everything(boil). when i bought my bottles i boiled all the parts and i washed tem afterwards. but it's up to you on what you choose to use.
AUK3lzEbaa	I think he's dealing with too much right now, after being suspended, and probably just angry of the fact he is in school. He probably hates it the most out of everything in the world; give him time, and if he doesn't treat you better, move on, Honey!|`|2d8c6f27c3437723163ff69e22f22598aa	he's just being weird cuz he's a boy  i dont think he means anything by it  so jus give it time|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	Well he just finished getting back, he probably is trying to cope with everything. Give him time, if he still doesn't then why dont YOU talk to him, im sure everything will go back to normal.|`|k6XRVeJxaa	Things change with time and you were done for a period of time. When you were gone he changed.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	maybe you should talk to him. if he still ignores you, find someone worth your time.|`|UxMugqdraa	say hey, if he ignores you then forget him. Move on. of course there'll be those akward look at each other moments but you'll get over it
UUpsa35Daa	For the written part... Don't get too cocky. Make sure to study until your heart's content because if you think you know the material and you fail, you'll be disappointed and upset. Study study study.    The the driving portion... Take it seriously but stay relaxed. Make sure not to lock your arms, it's easier said than done let me tell you. Just pay attention to things...keep your eyes open, literally and figuratively.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Make sure you know the car you will be taking your test in well.  Know where all the controls are for like the windshield wipers, lights, etc.      Make sure you know how to parelle park.    If you are taking the test in a standard, make sure you can drive in all conditions without bunny hopping or rolling (like up hill, moving from a dead stop, etc)    Make sure you come to a complete stop at stop signs, NO rolling stops.    Make sure you know what all the signs mean and follow all traffic signals.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Be calm.|`|7HEZhx46aa	1. Try to relax and keep both hands on the steering wheel.,  2. Pay attention to the road, but LISTEN to what the examiner is telling you to do  3. DON"T get nervous if you see him/her writing something down on that little clipboard -- sometimes, it's just a notation that a task was completed.  4. Don't be afraid to look at the mirrors (rearview and side mirrors).  5. DO NOT BRING YOUR CELL PHONE WITH YOU or, if you DO, TURN IT OFF DURING THE TEST!!    Remember -- generally you really have to screw up to fail the driving test --like run a red light or answer a ringing cell phone.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Study the manual. Some of the questions will be common sense, but some are kind of tricky so you're better off studying despite what other people might tell you.    Practice driving as much as you can before taking the driving exam. Pay attention to every sign and detail.. remember to stop for a full 2 seconds at a stop sign, my cousin failed because she only paused for a second. Don't stress though, it's not that hard, so if you prepare you are fine. Tons of idiots drive if they can do it, you can.|`|mpc6aNvCaa	the one thing the girl who gave me my driving test said remember to breathe and i got my when i was 30 no joke. just remember what u read in the book and if not passing u can take it again, after it's done u can ask questions i passed the 2nd time missed a couple of things driving and asked them what i could do they said it will get better with time.  good luck and remember to buckle up and be safe.|`|AA11331863	stay calm, and study.  on the  skills test part when you tense up your reaction are not smooth and on the written test if you have read the book and know it well  you  shouldn't have any real problems.  approach it like any other test you might take, eat before you go , use the bathroom and stay off the phone.
3CVfUiiJaa	I think you would just have to detach yourself from the situation and remember that you are doing a job with a child who can't do for him or herself.  Also, if I were in that position I would put myself in the parents shoes, and realize that I would be very grateful for someone taking on this responsibility of taking care of my son or daughter just as well as I did at home.  It is good to remember that it is not the child's fault they have special needs.    I used to work as a home care helper with a down syndrome/epileptic girl.  She was in her 30's but couldn't really do anything for herself.   She really took a liking to me and she would let me wash her hair and help shower her.  Her mother(main care giver) said that no one had ever been able to help with these things before.  I think that because I went in and treated her like she was normal or as normal as I could,  she felt comfortable with me.  I wasn't nervous either...I think that no matter what the special need is, they can still sense that a person is nervous.    Good luck with it, working with special needs children and adults isn't easy, but it is rewarding.
i2nCISQtaa	talk to your parents about this... worry about school not SEX!!    come back about 4-5 years from now when you're a responsible adult|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think if you have to come on yahoo answers asking people these questions, you have no business considering sex.     It hurts the first time for most people.  Yes, most people bleed.  Some guys prefer shaved, some don't.    I was 15.  I'm not going to share that with a 14 year old.|`|fZGcufB7aa	Okay wow! Umm.. I think you should wait until your at least 16. But I'll answer your questions anyway:  Does the first time hurt:  Once again WOW! If you don't know that then your def not ready for sex. I'm only 11, but I know a lot. Of course the first time hurts. He will break you hymen. That's also called popping your cherry.     Will you bleed?  Some girls do some girls don't. I just depends make sure he is really gentle. But since he is going to break your hymen then most likely yes your going to bleed.    Should you shave?  What are you going to do oral too? If so then you should probably shave. But don't shave it all off cuz I tried that once and it felt absolutely terrible!    I haven't had sex yet, but you should start by kissing him and then him kissing you on your neck then he will move down. And you know what I mean. He might suck on you in places that you aren't comfortable with yet. If you want oral then he will lick you softly "down there" and lick your clit. You are supposed to lead him and tell him what you like. You shouldn't be asking us. What I told you about how you should start out with sex is what I would do with the guy who is 15 that I have a huge crush on. I think about it every night. But honestly would it sound right for an 11 y/o(me) getting pregnant? Well it's not to big of a leap for an 11 y/o that's pregnant to a 14 y/o. Please if you do ths be safe make sure he uses protection. Talk to him first about whaat you want him to do to you.|`|ozATw7s0aa	edit: my careful so careful below basically means don't do it, to the person who thumbs downed me. :'(    Just be careful, like really, REALLY careful. And I'd recommend mentioning it to your mom, if she's said anything like telling her before you do it, it's kind of a big thing if you get pregnant and she's like YOU HAD SEX?! lol.    I haven't had sex, but my friend has, so...    Yes, it hurts, she said it hurts like h3ll, and no you don't have to shave..    xx|`|JdFgf575aa	Yes.  Probably.  Yes.  Virgin.|`|7x9lvbhAaa	yes the first time hurt alot soooo painful i would be scared if i was you.yes you will bleed their's a ball in side your pvt part that has blood and when he inject you you will bleed the frist time only no you don't have to shave i was 16 really you shouldn't have sex your too young.good luck|`|Lftu0e4Daa	I lost my at the age of 15 and Im 17 now turning 18 in 5 months. It didnt hurt my my first time but sometimes it hurts other people, I didnt bleed, you should shave down there, mine was planned, it was my 3 month anniversary with my boyfriend at the time.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Didn't you ask this yesterday?|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	Let it naturally happen, your not ready. First of all it can't be planned it loses all beauty. Yes, it does hurt, you will bleed, and if you dont already shave, thats gross. You deff. arent ready.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	I'm 16, never had sex.  It would hurt for your first time I suppose.  It may bleed.  ...Erm, if you really want to shave down there.  ..Never. And I'd suppose mine will be planned. :)|`|kM9xoajHaa	do not have sex until you are ready|`|0hxK0khKaa	I've never had it but my sister told me about it. I don't plan on doing it until I really like a guy though =)    YES it hurts horribly  Yes, you'll bleed  Keep a little of it, if you're heavy guys usually don't like that, but none is idk too bare or something, forgot what she said lol  She was 16 or something...Maybe 17..IDK! She's 20 though  She just like went to her boyfriend's house and got in the mood    Use birth control. And, make sure you're ready cuz 14 is young. Condoms can break...|`|KdqaGnlwaa	Are you mentally prepared to have sex?   Do you know of the consequences of having sex?  Did you know wearing a condom does not prevent pregnancy 100%?  Are you ready to have a child?   Are you ready to be called names for having sex so young?  Is the guy your boyfriend?   Is he ready?    Just because you think you are ready does not mean you are.  I'm 26 years old and have only had sex with 2 men in my life.  The first guy I was with, I ended up marrying him.  I was 18 years old and I look back now and I wish I would have waited. Its not all fun and games like you think it is.  The second guy I was with, was a huge mistake! I didn't have any feelings for the guy, I just did it for the hell of it. I worked with the guy, and he was all flirty with me and once we did the deed, he no longer talked to me like he used to, I was just another co-worker.     Having sex with someone you do not love, is a joke.  I have a much better time having sex with my husband who I love with all my heart, than I did with that guy.  Its just not the same.     My opinion, you are way to young! What is the rush nowadays?  I have a 15 year old cousin who just gave birth to a baby girl.  She just turned 15, which means she was your age when you got pregnant. At least she was mature enough to step up to her mistake and she did not have an abortion.  Think about it. That could be you in 9 months.      "One night of pleasure, nine months of pain, a life long responsibility."|`|d5e3g4LEaa	Hi,  I think you should wait - until there isn't a question left in your mind that you ARE ready.  You are so young and there are so many things to beware of - sure there is pregnancy - but there are also sexually transmitted diseases (some that condoms DO NOT prevent and are NOT curable), will you two be in a faithful relationship, will this be something you'd be ashamed to tell your family? Is it your boyfriend you've had for a LONG time? How will you feel if he does it with someone else or leaves you just because you might not be ready. (in this case he's not worth it anyhow).  There are so many things that are more important - like school, and family and friends instead of sex.  I can guarantee you that you will not be with this person still later in life and will have given your virginity to someone you will later regret.    to answer your questions...  Yes, it WILL hurt - plus your body isn't even fully developed yet.    You Might bleed - if your hymen is still in tact you will.  I was someone who waited until I was 18 - and still regret the first guy I 'did' it with - I thought I loved him, but clearly it puppy love.  Sex is so much more meaningful when you know yourself and you know that you are ready to share such intimate moments with someone.    In high school there were so many girls that became sluts because they had sex for approval from their boyfriends and their 'friends'.  Sure they were popular among the boys, but for all the wrong reasons.    I know I may sound harsh, but I promise you, you will appreciate having your self respect and virginity if you wait.  Please make a wise decision and don't let peer pressure or the heat of the moment take away something that is precious.|`|HjxwlFGLaa	hahah you are 14, your not ready.|`|CfXLUEn8aa	I think since you're asking all these questions, you're not ready. Just because you have condoms or whatever does not mean anything.   -YES, it does hurt.  -YES, you may bleed.  -If you don't know what the guy likes, (shaved or un-shaved) you shouldn't be involved until you know.    You're too young to be able to think of having some other guy inside you.|`|AUK3lzEbaa	Does it the first time hurt? for girls yes  Will I bleed? maybe  Should I shave "down there" Recommended.  How old were you when you first had sex? 11 ):  How did it start? Act innocent; plan it, but still seem taken away by the experience.|`|0cgAzc3Uaa	If you are this nervous about it, you're not ready to have sex. You are very young, and trust me, as someone who's been in this situation, if you lose it to the wrong person, things can get ugly.  However, if you feel like you absolutely must, I'll answer the questions:  1.) It may hurt your first time. Most likely it will, however, if you are very relaxed and into it, it should be a temporary pain, similair to a hard pinch.  2.)You most likely will bleed- a little.  3.) It's your choice to shave, however, I would reccomend it.  4.)I was sixteen, and I was stupid!  5.) We planned it.|`|L0873cdDaa	Do not have sex.

Shave...YES  How old was i...15  How did it start... i knew it was going to happen so it wasn't exactly planned  when ever you plan in sumthin usually happens  and foreplay...YES if you use lube maybe not...but in you don't its gonna be dry|`|Xu5BtID1aa	Here the thing!! So I was 16 when I first had sex with someone who I thought I loved and would be with! I didn't bleed, but you could, it didn't hurt me, but some of my friends did!    Now that I am married, I TOTALLY regret not waiting for my husband! I was his first, but he wasn't mine, and I feel ashamed about him not being my first!    BTW: If your not going to want a child, I strongly advise you to wait until your married, condoms don't always work!!    If you "think" your ready to have sex, talk to your parents and doc, so they can talk to you about things and get you on Birth Control Pills!|`|K6adgpAXaa	ok i was 13 when i had sex and i dosent hurt a bit i loved it!!!! i am 18 now i when i feel lonlyi hump my pillow you should try that first and then if you like the feeling go for it find a guy that wants to do it with you.|`|1qXLDOiPaa	OK 1 i'm just gonna be straight up with you   2 You sound like an imature little girl   3 OF COARSE your not ready!! if you were you wouldnt be asking all these questions!!|`|BBhVUNKOaa	you are asking??? then that means you are not ready... please dont be a static.. dont be like all the other horny teenagers.... probably dont even know how to wipe their *** right.. and the say that they are ready... and when the end up pregnant they cry to their mommies.. that is just stupid....
2nfMSDiPaa	What causes nasal congestion and nosebleeds: High levels of estrogen and progesterone increase blood flow to all the body's mucous membranes, including the nose, causing them to swell and soften.     What you need to know about it: It probably feels like every part of your body is swelling these days, but honestly now  your nose? You're as stuffed up as if you had a cold or allergy, and the constant blowing coupled with the hormonal changes in your mucus membranes produces the occasional nosebleed. You may also develop postnasal drip, which in turn can occasionally cause coughing.    My sister Had the same problem It only went away,when she had the baby!!  Hope this helps hun!!Hope you get the result you want!!    take care!!|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Yep!  I've been pregnant four times and I always have that symptom!  Runny nose, draining sinus' its just awful! Lol but its totally normal.
52U22fiAaa	Bloodwork, paperwork, medical history, height/weight, PAP Smear, they'll check teh baby's heartbeat and do an ultrasound.|`|mZNhAbIWaa	You will get the works maybe even a ultra sound to see your baby they usually can tell you what it is at 5 months. So you don't know when your due date is? Get plenty of rest because they will take blood, pap smear,and all that good stuff. Good Luck.|`|LABC73E7aa	pregnancy test, pelvic exam, pap smear, std testing, blood work and ultrasounds. discussion on prenatal vitamins.make sure u write down all ur questions just in case u forget one! good luck and congrats!|`|8c4kRTnPaa	Your doctor will take your medical history, take like 5 tubes of blood, answer any questions you may have, and sometimes they do a pelvic exam. Mine didn't because I just had one last fall. I was 10 weeks when we went and the doctor was able to pick up the heartbeat with a doppler. He or she might do an ultrasound too. Congrats!!|`|EgIHbCfRaa	Well all doc offices are different, but typically the first visit is a with a nurse and you just answer a bunch of questions. The second one you get to meet your doc and she will give you a pap and a blood test and listen for the babies heart beat. If she can not hear the heart beat then you get a sonogram! Those are always so cool cause you actually get to see the little one, but you are far enough along that they should be able to hear it. As far as baby movement, you really shouldnt be able to feel it or atleast very often...maybe your further along then you thought?? Good luck mamma! 8 )|`|FjGeKhY0aa	They will check your weight, height, urine, pap smear (that's the most uncomfortable thing) and blood pressure. You will have to go for a blood test soon. The doctor will talk to you what's going to happen in your next appointments and give you a bunch of stuff to read about pregnancy, what's good and what's not. I think that's it. Oh, you will listen to your baby's heartbeat!|`|780ByZVEaa	you will have to have a pelvic exam, pap smear, blood tests and history, filling out paperwork. Listening to the heart beat easy stuff ;)
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	There's nothing you can really do right now, except relax. Try walking and soaking in a warm tub. Baby will come, don't worry. And if they have to do a c-section, don't be afraid. Lots of women go through them and the most important thing is that baby is okay. I cannot say which is harder, natural childbirth or a c-section, the recovery from both takes a while. Don't stress out about it now, everything will go the way it needs to, I know it's hard to believe but it will all be over so quickly and you will have your beautiful, healthy baby in your arms.    Best of luck, hang in there!|`|258e111d9f41b74795cfc21f74849106aa	Sound like me with my first one. I was miserable. Unfortuntely, my labor never started on it's own and I had to be induced. Just because your baby is in your ribs doesn't mean she's big and you'll have to have a C-section...you are carrying her high!!! You're baby will come when it's ready or the doctor thinks it's time. Some people say having sex, or walking works, but it only works if the baby is getting ready. I sooooooo know how you feel, but you'll have to wait to see that beautiful little girl!! Good Luck.|`|62c46c155ac9129ababc1c13d11b511eaa	Do not worry your baby wont come till it is ready and do not worry about a c section i have had 3 c sections nothing to be frightened off|`|AA12025974	When your mucus plug drops, then you will know that labor will be with 1-2 days. baby will drop extremely low, you will feel the difference because the baby will no longer be in you chest, but in your bladder. Then usually your water will break. Hopefully on its own.     Good luck with the baby.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Since you are so close, walking or sex is your two best options for getting labor started, good luck it wont be much longer.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	you sound a lot like me! i am so uncomfortable. i am 31 1/2 weeks with twins...doctors told me that they expect me to deliver anytime now. one baby dropped and the other is still pretty high up there...so its hard to sit down or lay down or do anything. just keep walking, it helps. she'll drop soon enough...don't worry.|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	go to your doctor.  they are there for that.  If they feel you are running too late they can induce labor.|`|eDnWMm3maa	Your body knows how to do its job. I know how frustrating the end of the pregnancy is, but baby will come when baby is ready. Doing things to bring on labour is risky. Besides, first babies tend to be overdue.    I was told my son would be ten pounds, but didn't want to get induced. He was born four days after my due date and was a healthy 8 lbs 15 oz. There is no way for them to accurately guess the weight of an unborn baby. They can be off by POUNDS.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Have sex. That can bring on labor. The recovery from natural birth doesnt take that long. From a c section it can take awhile and its very painful|`|douKjB83aa	A humans gestation period is 40 weeks. But since you are uncomfortable you should call your doctor and see what they can do.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	Go walking.  I hear it is suppose to help out alot.  Stay active and she should drop into position hopefully.  Congrats!!!|`|GdSzrtmAaa	There is not much you can do besides laying on your left side and walking.

AA11763588	No, you can get an infection.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	No.  Why would you want to?|`|IlSALGKMaa	No, if you tell them you are pregnant, they aren't allowed to pierce you and if it's obvious, they won't. You can get an infection that could affect the baby and also, you would most likely bleed more because you have more blood when you're pregnant.    But my ex-friend got a piercing when she was like 7-8 months pregnant. (She was over weight and wore a large sweater to cover it up.) I don't recommend it, though. She's really stupid.|`|YH46aQCtaa	You could get an infection. Maybe you should just get one after you have the baby. But sometimes it depends on what piercing your getting. Go ask your doctor if its okay for you to do that.|`|tVmnGGuvaa	nope.
rMNWd17saa	Hopefully she stopped smoking pot as soon as she found out she was pg and no harm was already done. Don't use any of those flushes, those can be harmful to baby.  Be honest with her doctor so he can run tests or whatever is necessary to be sure baby is developing normally.  Some doctors have actually approved prescription marijuana to mothers who suffer depression or loss of appetite.  It is free of chemicals when prescribed by doctor.  Much safer than cigarette smoke.  They say that it is better than anti-depressants and helps relieve morning sickness.  I don't know.  I have 6 children and the strongest thing I ever took was tylenol when I really needed it!!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Stop smoking.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	stop smoking        duh.       she should have her baby taken away from her      EDIT: people you can give me all the thumbsdowns you want, im standing my ground.

It's basically just research on marijuana use during pregnancy and shows the true effects, because most studies on pot and pregnancy in the US involve other drugs including alcohol. The results will probably surprise you.    http://www.medicalcannabis.com/pregnancy...    Also, the issue isn't really for her to clean her system out. It's already gone through her system and will clean itself out. She just needs to stop smoking and it will happen.

AA11488344	Mine started between 4 and 6 weeks pregnant and lasted until about 16 weeks. I was sick all day long, not just in the morning.

Gfzzn1Pgaa	There are SO many reasons as to why women may miss their period or be late etc. It may not necessarily mean that you are pregnant, although, I would take a pregnancy test as soon as possible to be perfectly honest. If you don't want to get pregnant, and I don't want to sound mean or anything, but I would use some protection, or do what I do with my long-term boyfriend and take the pill and use condoms =)    Good luck =)|`|7AYnWg3paa	TAKE A TEST|`|dnG7fhnbaa	"Spotting" in pregnancy isn't uncommon.    If you're two weeks late and you are pregnant then you will be about 6 weeks pregnant so you can take a test and there should be enough HCG in your blood for the result to be accurate.     If it's negative go see the Dr to find out why you've not had your period.|`|kbP32zIUaa	if you had rough sex before hand, if could be a sign of that.. otherwise you could be coming on.. so id check every day for signs.. take a pregnancy test when you can x|`|K6rZmVmAaa	HAVE A TEST.
WoxMH0wZaa	For the boy, I definetly like Joel David best.     For the girl I like Lilyanna Rose (because I LOVE the name Lily!) and Noella Jane.

796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	Actually, it was neither. It just wasn't talked about one way or another. My Mom has told me since that she assumed both my brother and I would experiment with masturbation at some point in our teenage years, but she never spoke of it to either one of us. We each had "the sex talk" with her at appropriate ages but masturbation was left out of the conversation. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's very healthy and natural for all people to practice.  Both men and women find masturbation to be a great tension release and its much safer then indiscriminate sex! Like anything else, it's better in moderation. It can be taken overboard and become a compulsion but for most people it's just a healthy activity. As long as people are still responsible with it then I see absolutely nothing wrong with masturbation for both adults and teenagers.<br>  <br>  Parents shouldn't shun any type of sex but instead educate their children on the proper ways and the proper times to engage in such activities. There are plenty of ways to have age appropriate and productive conversations with children about that part of their life. Pretending it doesn't happen doesn't change the reality.<br>  <br>  Interesting question and thanks for answering mine! :-)<br>  <br>  Brit|`|oP504BtFaa	It was never brought up. Ever. To this day I have never heard about or talked about masturbation with ANYONE in my family. I, too, think it is a natural part of adolescence and LIFE for that matter. Call me a little old fashioned, but I don't think it should be talked about - I definitely don't look down upon it, in fact I would encourage it to sex, but it is a very personal thing, which should be done in private.|`|NI0cNU22aa	I had the rare kind of religious parents who realized that withholding information and treating sex and sexuality as taboo subjects, to quote my father, "creates perverts, not saints." Since he saw a lot of pregnant teenagers (and STDs) in his office in rural Tennessee, he made sure we understood that religiously, he disagreed with sexual activity before marriage, but that it was always a subject he was willing to discuss openly and without judgment.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	In my parents household it was honestly never discussed. So to really say it was accepted or shunned is kind of hard. To actually be quite honest my parents never did the actual "birds and bees" talk, sex wasn't even something we (my sister and I) were supposed to be thinking or talking about.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	it was something that wasn't talked about.  although we would make fun of my brother.  it was never something that was addressed in terms of female thing.<br>  nothing religious, my parents don't discuss sexual stuff, unless my dad is trying to gross us out with stuff w/him and my mom.  :-)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	My parents never mentioned it, not once. It wasn't something we discussed and they probably figured it was my business or whatever. But I'm a 'religious Christian' and I feel the same way about it. <br>  <br>  I kind of agree with your take on it.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Sometimes masturbation is a cry for help, its not always a natural urge. Some are exposed to things, and they think its normal.....but, its not at all....|`|k7FD3rt5aa	It never came up. I think u could say I was a little sheltered.  lol|`|WirFwirLaa	It was never discussed.

We were not a religious family, so that would not have been a factor, but my mother was not exactly the type who talked about such things.  We never had any discussion around sex.   I do plan to talk to my sons about sex as they get older, I doubt I'll mention that specifically though, my concerns will be more that they don't get a 16 year old pregnant.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Accepted so long as it was done in private. I mean that it was discussed early on, your body, your choice, no shame, just by yourself kind of conversation. It's healthy and natural.|`|AkFag8tNaa	They didn't say much, but they did acknowledge that it was something that made your body feel good and that it wasn't a bad thing.....|`|SnQvsOPwaa	shunned|`|WlU3NFu6aa	my parents never mentioned it. they didnt have the sex talk with me until i was like 13 or so. I remember when i was about 12 or 13 i had a huge crush on an actor and i was making a scrap book of pictures (lame i know, but i was young). anyway I kept my door closed because i was embarassed, we never talked about that kind of stuff in my family. well my parents knocked on hte door and i quickly hid it but i still had glue on my hands. they were talking to me and noticed i had stuff on my hands. they gave each other this look, asked me what i was doing, and my mom even smelt my hands! looking back i know they though i was maturbating. and by the way they acted, im sure it was not looked at as a good thing|`|gx4s68s8aa	I am a Christian and I was raised in a Christian home.  From a very young child my mother told my sister and I that if we felt like we needed or wanted to "play with ourselves" that it was fine as long as we did it in our bedroom with the door closed.<br>  <br>  She just told us this when we were little and didn't bring it up really after that.  It was just an understanding that exploring your own body was a natural thing to do in private.  <br>  <br>  My mother wasn't the best (who is) about telling me about sex, but with this she really did a good job.  It was never something to be really ashamed of.  It was just a biological function.
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You may have to bring out the big guns. Fatty food. :)    Switch to whole milk for a little while. And at meals when you have veggies or meat. Add some butter,cheese,extra calories where you can.  And don't feel bad for having an extra brownie or bowl of ice cream when you want. Since you are trying to gain weight,it won't hurt anything.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Not all of them are rite on...my friend had an u/s and they said her baby weighed 9 pounds + which wasn't true her baby was 8 pounds..|`|2ea0131ea655753572f33b84f26cdfffaa	It is normal for a growing baby to have periods where they seem not to really be growing.  I suppose it is because the energy is being put into developing other parts.      Also, regarding eating - don't just eat as much as you can! Unless you were severely underweight prior to your pregnancy, you only need like an additional 500 to 1000 calories per day!  Just make sure what you eat are things that will work as building blocks for your baby  (vitamins and mineral-containing foods like vegetables, dairy products, protein, and can't forget fat!) but at the same time cutting down on your sugar intake.    Your baby is just about ready to be born, but you'll see that unless you are doing something to hamper your babies growth (i.e. smoking, drinking, drug-use) then your baby will be the proper size when time for him or her to be born.  You still have about 6 weeks left to go (give or take) so I think the baby will be just fine (once again, as long as you're not doing anything to hamper the babies development, as I mentioned above.)    And yes, Ultrasounds are usually pretty accurate in estimating a baby's weight because they measure the babies size.|`|RYNquyTFaa	i was loosing and they induced me keep pointing it out thats what i did until they did something about it i dont think its good for you to not be gaining what if your baby is not getting what he/she needs.. you know idk i would say just keep metioning it thats what i did and also they said my baby was 8 and a half pounds in the ultrasound and he was 7lbs 6oz so yeah not that accurate.. LOTS OF LUCK and GOD BLESS..|`|53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	i think i can relate to you very very easily. i hardly gained anything in the first trimester. a total of 8 pounds in the second trimester and right now i am 34 weeks pregnant but my weight gain is really slow. i went to my doctor after 6 weeks on my 32 weeks appointment and i gained a total of 3 pounds in 6 weeks. im going to see my doctor on my 34 week appointment on friday so lets see how much i have gained. my suggestion to you is to switch to whole milk for a while. and try to eat nuts if you are not allergic. best of luck
XmJZkFuMaa	My daughter's first steamed food was squash too.  :)  It's a family tradition.  We just mashed it once it was good and steamed and then fed it to her like that, we didn't puree it.  She never liked the runny baby food but wanted the #2s almost immediately (not that we used a lot of baby food, but I do remember trying her on the #1s and she hated them, went to the #2s liked some of them, then we didn't really do more than that...)  So before making it too runny, try just feeding it to her at a grainy/thick consistency.  If she has trouble, then thin it out some.<br>  <br>  We picked out the seeds for her.  They can't really chew them so it just comes out whole in the end.  No real point to those.<br>  <br>  With carrots, we just mashed those up with a little bit of milk.  She liked them a bit thicker and liked the taste of them on their own.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	def take the seeds out; puree to the consistency you want, adding water slowly to get it the right way.....|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't think you want the seeds in there but add as much water as you think you want.

Keep adding until you get to the right consistency.  I don't add water to my son's food anymore, but I did when he was first starting off on foods.<br>  <br>  For apples, I just peel them, cut them up into chunks, and cook them in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of water for maybe 6 or 7 minutes.  Then, just mash them up the same way, with a fork.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	do "puree" but add milk (not water) to improve taste. as for apples, try and core them before cooking (when you cook apples, the best would be to boil them and then use the naturally infused water as an alternative to those sugar-laden things sold at the stores - and then use the soft apples to make your own applesauce without adding sugar)..|`|DLDweOcYaa	I put all the vegetables and meat in 1 pot.  Cook it then put it all in the blender and add some of the liquid from the pot and blend it.  If it is too thick then just add some more liquid.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	You slice the apples up thin to make stewed apples. You cover the apples with water. (just enough to cover them) and cook them in saucepan on the stove top. Heating kills bacteria and germs. Once they are cooked. wait until that have stopped steaming and put in fridge. With vegetables once they are steamed you can mash them up while still warm/ blend them.|`|GMQfejxKaa	At 7 months you shouldn't need to add water, but if you do, I add a liitle of the water that I used to steam them with (because it has all the nutrients in it) and then put in the blender and puree.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Throw it in the blender with a little bit of boiled water, just start with a bit, and once you blend it you will see if the texture is okay or not, add more if needed.  You don't want it too runny.  Good Luck:)

LdoCKo4Qaa	No.|`|SVyBjDguaa	Well, I think that names that have flowing middle and first names sound nicer than if you were to name your kid something that doesn't flow.    As for the sibling, I really don't see why that matters. It's not like on an application it's going to say like Jacob and Leigh on it. (just an example)    =]|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I don't really understand the whole "matching" thing. Obviously if you wanted to name your kids something that sounded extremely similar, or was essentially the same name like Mary and Marie or something it's too much, but otherwise, who cares?|`|75HzIpSraa	i do think the first and middle names should flow!! Siblings no don't think it matters!|`|aS8TjALBaa	I think the name should flow.  Too many chances to get ridiculed when young if it's too weird.      Some families have a tradition of naming their children similiar.  It's personal preference.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I agree with you about the middle name.  Pretty much the only time you ever use the whole name together is on a birth announcement... and then 20-some years later on a wedding invitation.  Of course, it's nice to have a name that flows well.  But if it doesn't, no big deal.    As for siblings names matching... I actually think it's kind of silly if the names match so closely that they sound cliche'.  But I do think you should avoid naming one child something that's completely different from the rest of the family.  For instance, if you have three daughters named Alessandra, Catharina and Isabella (very feminine names).. and then name the next girl Ann, poor little Ann might feel boring and plain compared to her sisters.
uYI8EdHFaa	ok my daughter in in 6th grade also.......they are kids the police should not get involved..... detention should be enough..not in school suspension...that punishment is extreme.... you should be the judge if they are going to talk to a sheriff or not that is crazy..have a talk with the princeball of the school and say they are going aLittleto overboard.....if your kid was older that would be another story|`|oyGn3gMIaa	yes but they made a big deal for nothing really|`|0Rlvb3Gyaa	yes, becauseif it was not yours why should you take it .duh|`|rJJhMQ37aa	If it wasn't his shirt, he should not have taken it.  Maybe having the sheriff talk to him will be a good thing.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	taking anything from anywhere which the item is not belong to you is stealing.  I think the school didn't overreact on this, because a 6th grader should old enough to understand this rule.|`|6PhSENcXaa	If and item doesn't belong to him and he takes it knowing full well it's not his it's stealing.  If it doesn't get nip in the butt now he'll do worst later.  This will hopefully teach him a lesson, as hard as it may be.  <br>  That's the problem with a lot of kids, they do something small and people let it go.  So the kid continues because, gee I got away with it so lets go for something bigger.  Next thing you know their going for cars and breaking into homes.  And you can't say no that won't happen because you know full well as I do it does happen.  It's very unfortunate that it does, but it's the truth.  And sad!|`|1QURArm3aa	Ask the school what they do with the items that no one claims.Our school takes them to goodwill.I think they r taking it out of control.How do they know the shirt was not his.If it was in the lost and found they didnt know whos shirts it was.SO whats the big deal about it.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Yes, of course.  You sound very immoral and unintelligent.  Stealing is taking anything that is not yours.  It wasn't his, was it?  Idiot.   They did not overreact.  I really doubt charges will be filed- that part was for a scare.|`|idMpK0suaa	Wow. That's freaking retarded.
AA12316174	The ones in my area are open monday thru friday and their hours vary some days they open at 1030 and are there till 7pm other days they open at 9am and are there till 5pm on saturdays they open at 9am to 1pm    If you plan on getting on the pill then you need to schedule an appointment. A pap smear and pelvic exam gets done prior to them dispensing your pills|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	i can't remember the hours...although i think its like 8am-6pm or something.  and birth control can cost nothing to how much ever money you can give them.... they usually ask if you can give anything at all so that they can continue to do things like that|`|EMKuBql8aa	http://www.plannedparenthood.org/    That should have all your answers, good luck.|`|FmgAfeWuaa	Some places actually give out birth control for free  our health teacher once gave us all a place to go if we needed  some and some planned parenthoods will give you all  the information you need about it    they are usually open on weekdays and weekends  9am to like 7pm all the times differ in certain places|`|MQ83HGD5aa	Go on their website to check hours in your area. Cost depends on if you have insurance...etc. I think when I got them from there it was about $15 for each month.
oZdIsSSEaa	It's a nice name that you don't hear very often, and it fits him fine (very cute picture). I don't think he will get picked on because there is a trend to pick more nontraditional names these days.  Grey is a cool nickname too.|`|ovIxSVKbaa	i think it fits him a lot and its a great name. i know a kid whos name is zander greyson and everyone loves his name|`|UlUTQamgaa	~ I knew a little girl when I lived in Louisiana named Grayson. She was an amazingly stable little girl, I never heard a child tease her once. I always thought it was more of a masculine sounding name though. It's cute, and he is a cutie his name fits him fine. Once he is in school I think children will be very tolerable of names that are considered "different" right now, because there are so many "trendy" names that people are naming their children. He will be fine!|`|IcxoK6j4aa	but i like that name because its like mysterious because u think he will be like 1 person like serious and stuff cause of a name but then hes a whole other person..... like this kid Greyson Michale|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	OMG! He is sooo sooo cute!  Um Greyson. I automatically think of someone smart. IDK why. No he won't get picked on for having that name.|`|gn0LrrSRaa	I don't think it really fits his face.    I think of the color grey when I hear it.  It's not my favorite, and kids might pick at it.|`|v8FlpPbGaa	Greyson isn't that weird when you say it.kinda sounds like Braison. there are heaps of weirder names out there so Grey for short is ok.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	That is a different name and one i have not heard before. It's not bad and your little brother is precious. :)  I think they will also call him Grey for short.    Greyson Michael or Greyson Anthony|`|5f69hQT2aa	Greyson makes me think of Son of Grey because, well that's what it means. It really should be a surname, and I don't particularly like it, but its not like you can do anything about it now.    As for teasing, the kids'll go for Gayson.
IHhDMHrGaa	Candle, if your church don't provide one... and i think a clean white cloth, they use it to dry off the holy water...|`|avx7bLnKaa	ask the church you are baptizing at|`|i8NOVfm0aa	if your church doesnt provide a candle you will need that. some people get a keepsake bib|`|7WcfzvPvaa	Just the christening gown. If you are having a celebration after, you might want to get the baby another special outfit that is all white, like a white stretchy or pajama or something, and a christening bib..  My church provided us with a candle.
PHOyKsmPaa	My friend who is a social worker told me that it is considered child abandonment if you leave your child alone before the age of 12 from child protective services, even though there is no legal age written in state restrictions.|`|b1TBeG3yaa	i wouldnt ike the thought of leaving my 10 yr old on his own eigther, i'd agree with your wife, if you cant offord after school clubs maybe he could go to a friends house until you or his mum could pick him up, or could he go to a relatives until you can pick him up? there are lots of things that can help you, you dont have to resort to leaving the porr kid on his own, good luck
qdFrJ21waa	I'm in the same boat you are. I'm 23 and my husband is 28 and I am just dying to have a baby. I think about it constantly and am so obsessed!...lol...I'm just trying to hold out until I'm finished with my masters. I've found that I can't really keep my mind off of it...whenever I see pregnant women or couples with their baby I feel a bit jealous and more impatient...lol. So I guess I don't have much advice...I'm trying to concentrate on work and school but it just creeps in all the time and I daydream about it. I do know that the longer I try to hold off, the more ready my husband will be and my family as well, I suspect they think I'm a bit young even though I feel pretty ready.     Sorry so long, just wanted you to know I feel your pain and I haven't found a good way to distract myself yet...|`|yuAI037Iaa	Just my personal feelings and experiences:  When i was 21 I had 3 children.  I now have 4.  I love and adore them and wouldn't trade them for nothing.  Their father walked out on me for another woman after 10 years of being together.  I am almost 27.  I now realize that I should have spent a little time being young instead of starting a family because i was about to explode.  My early twenties were spent changing diapers and making bottles.  If i could go back i wouldn't change my mind about having children just when i had the children.  I know in my new relationship that i want to spend time just me and him and my children of course before adding the "stress" of babies.  You have to get your relationship solid and both of you need to want to have children at that time or it won't be a positive thing.  My first baby was wanted by him and I agreed not because i wanted to but because i was fearful of him leaving.  6 months into the pregnancy i was totally excited and he woke up one day and told me our lives were over and it was a mistake.  He was a total *** for months after the baby was born.  It made our beginning rocky.|`|1F7eYuNWaa	Borrow (babysit) whenever you can!    Now is a good time to do lots of things that you can't easily do with a baby.  Travel, go to movies, sleep in, have friends over for late night fun.  When you do have a baby, you won't feel deprived because you'll know you had your "roaring twenties," so to speak.    Remember that a baby becomes a toddler really fast.  Try babysitting a toddler and you might be content to wait a little while longer for one of your own.  They are awesome, though!|`|t9Nw86Plaa	I know you're impatient, but you are both young, so if you love your spouse it is in your best interest not to pressure him.     I'm sure your spouse knows how badly you want children, but if he's not ready yet, then you could just put a lot of strain on the marraige by pushing the issue now. Even if you want 5 or 10 more years, you'll still be young enough to have a healthy baby.     In the meantime, you could get a pet, or another hobby to try to take your mind off of it.
5EFc1QYbaa	Only if there is uncertainty as to who the dad is|`|AkFag8tNaa	Only if there is another man contesting the paternity, otherwise, that's a huge invasion of privacy and very wrong in my opinion.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	If he is the only one possible father yes<br>  <br>  If there a chance he is not, do not put him on|`|KNxs4PrZaa	not unless there is a question.  i would have been a little annoyed if they had made my husband do a DNA test for our daughter when we knew he was the father.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	In my opinion, not unless there is some controversy over who the father is. I would have been upset if my husband had to take a DNA test when my son was born.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	If they are the babies fatehr, no, but if they arent sure if they are tehn the should take a blood test first to be sure then be put on the babies bc|`|w7fCw6WTaa	That's a bit cynical surely?|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	no but they are starting to do this in some places due to goverment help or something idk..
501e0e95642a28c15746b2bf96c44052aa	Emawee, tell this gal she disgusts you and walk away.   Then enjoy your birthday goodies.  Thank you and good day.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	I had the same problem only thing is that I couldn't keep myself from beating the crap outta her and so i did. Now when I look back, I think about what I could have done to avoid it...<br>  <br>  One of the most important things you could try would be to think about how she can't do anything to you unless she touches you or hits you first. That's what I did but instead I said I won't smack the crap outta her until she says something to my face and when she did I fought her.  In your case, you could just wait until she hits you first.... tell her that you don't want to go back and forth arguing, tell her you don't have time for that.|`|vLJKNkNLaa	If she instigates anything, walk away.<br>  Be the bigger person.|`|7ZNRqKbKaa	Trust me, there is some people i want to fight to. But honeslty, its not worth it. You would get suspened and all that crap. Just try to avoid her as much as you can, ignore her. Im not trying to encourage fighting but if she starts it you should end it. haha.<br>  anyways happy early birthday! haha.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Wow.<br>  Ignore her <br>  and ask a real question;)|`|AA10672842	EmaWeeE, We all make choices in life and I'd think it is about time to start making some good ones. You must take responsibility for your choices.You say you don't worry about getting another suspension but it is going to come up and be a thorn in our side one day.It is not a feather in your cap to say you can fight someone and beat them.It should be an automatic suspension and repeated offences should lead to the person being kicked out of school. Keep in mind for future reference when you apply for some college courses you may have to go for a  personal interview.They want to ensure that when a course has limited enrolment that the best applicant is accepted.Do you really want to risk  your future on your suspension record and a cookie? EmaWeeE I don't think at almost 16 you need us to tell you what the right thing is to do.You know what the answer is.I  think it is more cool to be smart  and make positive choices than it is to act the fool.I think you've answered your own question, you just need the courage to act upon it.Take care.|`|mu3b40doaa	Don't fight. It's bad.<br>  Seriously, over here we had a 17 year old girl beat a classmate within an inch of her life. The girl is still in the hospital after 6 months. The "beater" is still sitting in jail and is being tried as an adult for aggrevated assult/attempted murder.  Just one incident ruined 2 girls lives. Not to mention their families. 2 moms lost their baby girls that day in a way. From what I heard, it started over a boy from freshman year and escalated to this three years later. Thise girls hated each other. You ought to think of which is worse. Having a cake, having no cake, or spending time in jail and no one even acknowledges you have a birthday.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Ask to be moved in Spanish class because you don't get along with the people around you and are finding it hard to learn.  If you Spanish teacher fights with this (first off she is stupid, second off) then you need to tell your parents you wish to be moved for academic reasons and have them speak with the teacher.<br>  <br>  The rest of the time just ignore her.  There is nothing more annoying then two girls who think they are cool for fighting.  And it's not just girls.  It's anyone.  Fighting is for losers.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Remember, if you don't fight with her you'll be the better person. <br>  And, every time you get ready to go off, remember the cake and cookies you'll be getting!|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Avoid her.  Don't let her bug you.  Don't talk about her and make her mad.  Just be happy, don't show her that whatever she does bugs you.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	....really?<br>  <br>  Grow the hell up.  Just ignore her and her antics.<br>  <br>  Is a stupid fight worth a suspension?|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Just beat her.<br>  <br>  Cookies and brownies? You could buy those from the store.<br>  Where msot likely shes getting them from<br>  <br>  :D|`|ruczpWrGaa	just dont talk to her at all. btw your friends have too much say in your life.|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	grow up|`|NqGl1tnTaa	wow girls can be hurtfull  yeah we all noee that! trust me ive been threw this!? and even more so a girl pushed me and walked away like a lil *****! i screamd at her to come back and i got introble ! huh gay!<br>  but you should just ignore this girl and i know its gonna be very very hard but all she want is tto look all hard infront of the boys!!!<br>  not very smart u live yur life like it dont matter THEM HATERS DONT MAttER!|`|72b18188bab9fa5e6eca215f0a556820aa	fighting gets you nowhere, there will always be someone bigger and badder than you. You may need anger management or counciling|`|T4gMdDXaaa	Mace her!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	just let her talk her **** that wont hert you and everthing would be fine
nhgQKvwEaa	Maybe he's just eating too much? My son will eat and then barf it back up when he's over full. It's normal. :)|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would give him solids by now, that is just me though. I had my baby throw up once and I called the doc and they told me just to keep a eye on her. She didn't throw up again, she was feed solids at 4 months. I would just call the doc before going right up there and see what they suggest.
UFXmnMBhaa	I like belle better as a name its not as plain but think beth sounds better.  Not much help I know.  Additional note to add just encase you didn't know lyra is the main character in the golden compass.|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	Lyra Belle!   Super cute I love it!|`|Jb26nbekaa	Lyra Belle because Lyra Beth sounds like Lyra Boottttthhhh lol.. anywayz Belle is a simple and unique name.. Please take my opinion.. lol trust me.. i know what im saying..       *best answer * lol * i hope*|`|TlF93Eusaa	name it isabellajane|`|xIFVIv1haa	the one wit belle
oXIYHsDaaa	yep perfectly normal kindergartner, I get "we played" or the occasional "it was boring"|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I have a 6yr old and his in 1st grade. But when he was in kindergarten I couldn't get him to be quiet. He talked about everything even when he got in trouble. I think you should spend a day with your son to see what is really going on. I think someone might be picking on your son and he doesn't want to tell you. But if you go and meet the other little boys and girls you can kinda of see for yourself if there is a problem or if your son is just trying to adjust to the classroom.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	my daughter is in kindergarten too, when i asked her about her day she usually can only answer "play", "i draw a picture ..." etc, if i ask what she has for lunch sometimes she said she forgot ... i think they are still a little too young maybe?|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i wouldnt worry about it, somekids are just so burnt out from their long day the last thing they want to do is rehash it at home.  Think about how an adult feels after a long day at work, dont really wanna talk about it at home too.|`|H1qpJc6Daa	He probably feels like he is a big boy now.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Oh lol...mine always forgets what she had for lunch! The other day her little friend came home with us after school and I asked her what they had for lunch to see if it was only my daughter who "forgets" and the  little friend couldnt remember either. My Mum says it is because they only care about "now" they just move on from what has already happened.
5IN0AjxOaa	The one's that entertain,  +& The ones that observe.    Well Baby,  I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl.  Don't like the backseat, gota be first.    =]].  Idunno,  First think to come to mind?|`|NhBi8q80aa	No no, my friend.    There are three types of people in the world...  Those who can count and those who can't.|`|xgdyNIT1aa	Those who watch as something important is happening, and those who make it happen.    And then there are those who ask what happened.    haha I just thought of that...|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	Hm... People that think there are two types of people and people that don't.    :S I think we're all just people. We all have differences.|`|Inc78M0Raa	The nice ones.  And the b*tchy ones.  Haha.  That's the first thing that came to my mind.  :D|`|RKId3WQxaa	smart and stupid|`|eCW3M8loaa	The " Popular" people and the people the popular people talk about.

Maybe i will.    no i won't.    anyways.  Leaders and followers?  I'm sorry, male and female is the only one that makes sense.    Innie belly buttons and outie belly buttons?

Edit: You asked a question, I'm the only one who answered it with logic, as all the other answers have more than two groups. In socitey, there are allways males and females. People who have a thrid gender often display characteristics of one sex over the other. So, if you want an interesting answer, you can get a wrong one, if you want a proper answer, you can have my one, if you want a joke answer, this is the wrong section.|`|kDvKc3npaa	those who pay taxes and those who don't, i believe i heard that on the Suite Life of Zack and Cody.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	Me and You    lol|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Popular people and people who get picked on by popular people.|`|9acXPi8gaa	Well the joke is, "there are three kinds of people in this world, those who can count and those who can't."

0Sv8PiH9aa	I'm due on the 15th! I honestly wish I could tell you a a good guess about when you will have him but I am in the same boat. All I can say is it could be any day now for both of us. I am getting the same feelings and symptoms as you, and he dropped about 2 weeks ago. So maybe you will have him before? :)|`|3DIImnDEaa	Sounds like you will be having him before February 14! GOOD LUCK! and CONGRATS!
RvddYKqjaa	Sure! Some babies are born with teeth. Nothing new there. :-)|`|PEvWgIkVaa	Yes, Babies Teeth on things trying to grow their teeth.|`|FL0S2tSCaa	Impossible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|j8bSJzSbaa	Absolutely!! My first born had just a tiny piece of his tooth coming in, we found out at his 2 week appointment.|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	Yup, she certainly could. Babies develop at ALL different rates. Some babies are even born with all their teeth. My first son had 4 on top and 4 on bottom by the time he was 3 months old! The only difference that early teething makes is the things that you can do to help with the pain. I gave my (2nd son) 11 month old teething son popsicles to help with the pain, but I couldn't do that for my 1-2 month old teething first son. We used those "make your own popsicle" things that you put in the freezer, but we just filled it with sterile water, and then rubbed the ice on his gums.. seemed to work great.|`|TkMwOjWDaa	Yes, your baby may be having her first teeth coming soon.  My daughters got their first teeth on the later side at 11 -12 months old... But my friend's son got is first teeth BEFORE 3 months old.  Your would be an early teething baby BUT not unusually early...    The main signs of teething that she may be experiencing are;   Gums over the erupting tooth can be swollen and red,   A spot of blood may be found where the tooth "cuts" through the gum, your baby's cheeks may become red, there may be more drooling... that can cause Diarrhea and diaper rashes,  Your baby will want to have something to bite... if you gently put you finger in your baby's month and gently rub and apply a little bit of pressure on the gums will sooth your baby after the first few moment.      You baby girl can be more irritable, her sleeping pattern can be disturbed and there could even be a low-fever (you should then be close to the day the teeth actually erupts).    I don't know what symptoms your daughter is experiencing... and it may still be a while before the teeth actually erupts from the gum...|`|3BB452Phaa	Yup....at least that is what my pedi. told me when I took my daughter to her 2 month check-up.  She had a running nose and was drooling a lot so I asked the doctor and she said it was due to teething.  The doctor said she could teeth for a few months before teeth break through!!!  Good Luck
FXINmF6saa	Baby's are never too young to try anything new. When a baby is 4 months old their system can handle bits of many things. That is how their body gets used to food and that is how you learn what they like dislike and what they are allergic too. Most kids get food allergies because they try something their body cannot digest because they have never had it in their body before but if you start letting kids try new things they like it and their immune system gets stronger. Those people that wrote those rude comments are really dumb and probably are the kind of people who bottle feed because they are too lazy to give them real food. My son started eating and trying food at 4 mon. and he was never allergic to anything nor did he ever get sick. Now my son is 13 mon. and eats like a big kid which is great because he'll try anything I give him. And I've personally never cared what people say and if they don't like our parenting skills then that's too bad they can do whatever they want with their kids. I know my baby started eating lemon some time ago and he loved it and whenever he sees it on the table I let him eat it. Kids are really smart and they know when they like something they'll eat it when they don't like it they won't eat it. Lemon is a fun fruit for them because it's got a tangy flavor and they love it. The lemon does nothing to them if it did my son would be sick already. My opinion is that she did well letting her baby try the lemon, starting to let her eat big people food will not only make her immune system strong but it'll make her a very good eater.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Well your not supposed to give a child that young citrus to begin with. <br>  <br>  Our daughter ate a lemon once when we were out at a restaurant. She was almost 2 though and it had come with her fish and chips. She tasted it made a horrible face and then ate it. Then she ate another one from my husb plate. <br>  <br>  I dont see the problem in letting children try different tastes as long as they are age appropriate. It could probably help in broadening a childs tastes for different foods.|`|1JGj56TFaa	I think its a good thing to let your baby experiment with different tastes (within reason of course!) as they will grow up to be less fussy eaters.  I let my daughter (6 months) try any food that I know will not do her any harm at her young age.  My daughter seems to enjoy all the different flavours and textures that she can experiment with and it has had no detrimental effects on her whatsoever.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I've never let my daughter taste a lemon or lime, but it's really because I've never thought about doing so. I probably won't until she's a little over a year though, just me personally. I don't think you're a bad parent if you do it...my husband would probably do it to see her make cute faces, but not me. I don't think it would completely ruin the child's trust though, I'm sure it would take more than that.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I think it's silly. I'll let my son try anything if it's not an allergenic food.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think when it comes to things like that if the baby wants to try something then I let them. Unless of course they are allergic and I know that. Anyways my daughter was 4 1/2 months old and she grabbed my ice cream from me and pratically attacked it and I know that some people would rip me for that but oh well, she is fine and is 7 months old and tries the majority of whatever I eat.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	my position that if baby is too young, then the parent has to be in charge of the foods that go into the baby's mouth (like actually watching the baby) but when baby is old enough to come and grab a piece, then it's called exploration and is a part of a healthy development|`|nhgQKvwEaa	Oh for crying out loud, some people need to find a sense of humor! I remember when my son (now almost 4) grabbed a lemon off my plate. He was about 9 months old, and he stuck it right in his mouth, the look on his face was priceless. It was a very cute moment, he didn't like it though! lol. There's no harm in that! Sheesh people!|`|XmJZkFuMaa	I think that age can be deceptive with little girls.  My daughter is 15 months old and was mistaken for a 10 month old yesterday.  heh.  <br>  <br>  In any case, I think parents should be in control of what the baby tries.  As for the lime, I wouldn't because it's a harsh reaction, and we have citrus allergies in my family.  Plus, citrus burns on the way out.  I mean, they tell you to feed your baby mandarin oranges until they're over a year or two because regular oranges can be too sour.  I can't imagine what a lime would do.<br>  <br>  As for the baby not trusting mommy... it depends.  If mommy has been introducing a million yummy things to eat and then one of them turns out icky poo, that doesn't mean that the baby won't go "okay, mommy shouldn't feed me green things..." and then eat everything else.  I have seen babies afraid to eat green things before (peppers, pickles, limes...) but it doesn't usually extend to mommy.  Now if it's Grandpa who gave the baby pepper-jack cheese, the baby may not trust Grandpa for a while with food, but not mommy.  Mommy is source of all good things to eat.  They'll blame the color or something else about it.<br>  <br>  I have family who gave their babies horrid HORRID things to watch their faces.  Tabasco sauce, peppers, limes, lemons, dill pickles, and on and on down the line.  They loved to do this before baby was a year old to make sure they got the first reaction.  I'm sorry, but people like that need to be smacked.  I don't mind letting baby explore, but there's limits.  The mom on the tube doesn't sound like she was doing that though.
POSGHgzuaa	There's no reason to start with yogurt and cheese and "work up" to whole milk.  (BTW, if your daughter hasn't had these foods yet, they are great ones to introduce.)  We found that it was easy because breast milk (whether from nursing or in a bottle) was always warm, and the cow's milk was always cold.  This helped my son recognize that they were different and not compare them - so he just thought of them as different and never rejected cow's milk.  We didn't mix them ever. That said, he's 19 months and still nursing twice a day.      If you think that your exposure to chemicals is going to be a problem, then you could consult a doctor or lactation expert.  Some are more of a problem for nursing than others.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	You can slowly introduce the whole milk by mixing it with breast milk first and slowly decreasing the about of mommy milk and increasing cows milk.  My son took it straight from the start, he didn't have much problems except for yellow stinky poop for about 2 weeks.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	It's all up to you, and how she reacts.  My ped. said milk after 1 year isn't absolutely necessary (as long as she's getting calcium somehow).  I used to give my son yogurt (the baby yo) for breakfast every morning.  I would offer milk, and if he drank it, that was fine -- if not, I didn't stress too much.  He slowly got used to drinking the milk instead of nursing.  Don't expect her to chug her milk like she would a bottle.  It's ok to sip along on it, as she's thirsty.    We've found, my son can't actually tolerate dairy.  So I give him rice or goat's milk, and he does just fine.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	most medical fields now say to breastfeed until 2 years, so if you want to just give her breast milk that's ok too. I gave my son mozzarella and brie cheeses before a year and he was fine, but didnt do the yogurt thing until closer to 18 months. He's fine, whatever works for both you and your child is fine. If you do the whole milk though, I would suggest giving it a transistion phase, where you would mix 1/3 whole milk rest breast milk for a week, then go half and half then for another week, then fully whole milk after that.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	i agree and have read that breastfeeding after 1 yr isn't really necessary.   You need to try to stop worrying so much.  you have given her the best start in life and she will build up her own immunities, also.    I would start  with some yogurt or cheese. my babies were having yogurt by 8 months.  they loved it.   after a week or two put some milk in her cup and let her try it
sK67bBy5aa	I know women that smoked through there whole pregnancy. it is not healthy for you nor the baby. So I suggest quit now!
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes you can and if it gets bad enough your doctor may even suggest something stronger.|`|FSPAKELyaa	I found a magic heartburn pill, its called Titralac and i swear it works as soon as you swallow!  You can get it at the pharmacy|`|jOBBlJnvaa	Yes you can take Tums...|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Tums are definitely on the safe list (I have no clue about rolaids.)  If you are ever in doubt though, you can ask the pharmacist where you are buying them.  I had them double check the Equate brand (Wal-mart) of Tums for me.|`|AsICkz9naa	Yes you can take tums alright, you can also take gaviscon. Talk to your pharmacist and tell him/her that you are pregnant and he/she can offer you something further if it's available.|`|AA10071149	I ate Tums like they were candy. The heartburn can be intense, especially as you get bigger.
e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Each opener takes about half an hour to set up and play.  Your concert will probably be from somewhere from 4-6 hours.  I went to one not too long ago with 3 openers before the main band and that concert ran for 5 hours.      Sounds like it'd be a fun show.  Luckyy.|`|9bmceqPcaa	Lucky!(:    Idkk But i wanted to comment;;to let yuu know that yur lucky Have Fun c(:|`|d7kGopYxaa	at least 4 hours + 1 1/2=5 1/2|`|3w5hiIIEaa	Cool, I'm going to the one in April, but, to answer your question, 4 or 5 hours.|`|AA12033493	im going to the same concert! in may  im guessing it will last a few hours bc there are a couple of bands playing    i cant wait=]|`|2OwAhwaEaa	About 3 hours.|`|Jucak0HLaa	A couple hours
5f6XnInEaa	My opinion of her has not changed, if anything, it has worsened.<br>  <br>  You are spot on, after viewing it, I just cringed with everything she said, she is 100% not with it, and has completely unrealistic views on the matter.<br>  <br>  If I wasn't in the room, and was just listening to the interview, I would have sworn it was a 12 year old girl, obsessed with babies.<br>  <br>  I just feel so badly for those poor children, she clearly cannot raise them, after all, in their first few weeks if life, she has spent more time on camera, than by their bedsides.<br>  <br>  The  money from all of the interviews is probably going to pay for more IVF.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	I haven't seen the interview.  I just have to wonder though how someone with 14 children has time to do all these interviews.  Is she dumping the kids on poor grandma?|`|lWcejimgaa	do you have the website where i can see this?|`|8oAlBL91aa	I did not watch it I didn't know it was on or I probably would have being that I can't stand that women.<br>  <br>  But I can say this much the other day while I was in line at the grocery store I saw her on a cover of a magazine and either they didn't put any makeup on her or they did and it just didn't matter because she looks so ugly. I guess that's what happens when he have 14 kids, hopefully that will be a lesson to anyone thinking about doing something stupid like that.<br>  <br>  Agreed with the person above me she does seem like she is just a little kid wanting to play or baby sit a bunch of kids, and also to the other person your absolutely right who is watching those kids you know she can't afford day care and I feel bad for that poor staff of Dr.Phill if it was them watching them.|`|AA11215049	I watched it and I thought it was very interesting to hear both sides, but the fact is, I don't think anybody in the right mind should support her.  Donations, volunteering, etc. is just going to enable her, and what's to stop her from doing it again?  The fact she is clearly mentally unstable, does not have the resources to care for the children she already had let alone 8 more, and already has her original children in substandard housing contributes to the fact that it would be in everyone's best interest for the children to be placed in different homes with parents who do have the resources to care for them.  Also, give grandma an all-expenses paid vacation for all the hours she spent caring for her daughters mistakes when she didn't have a choice!|`|pMMYkNA2aa	What a crazy person!  She kept interrupting Dr. Phil!  Talking over him, dodging questions, evading things.  She kept saying she had a plan while she was pregnant for 30 weeks.  When she found that she was pregnant with 8 she could have done a selective reduction, I know that sounds unpleasant, but the more fetuses the more likely one or more of them would have serious problems.  How irresponsible she is!  No plan, no money, no home, no help.  How will she ever hope to get a job?  She just wants a tv show, a free home, free income... its disgusting!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I posted a similar question earlier.  My opinion has not changed.  She is hungry for attention and is not stable in the mind.  I believe her to be very selfish and irresponsible as well.<br>  <br>  She may love her kids, but she is not thinking of their best interest.<br>  <br>  Here's my question that I posted earlier.  It kind of reinforces my point of view above:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AskNvOBoVHyoT8evLHdVJdDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225133305AADjee1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, she couldn't have felt that good with all those babies in there, so that probably wasn't the best time to plan. I think she has mental problems that led her to make bad, selfish choices. I'm astounded that people are so worked up about it. I don't think she'll keep her children long, if, in fact, she is allowed to bring them home. I think CPS will be highly attentive to the children's care, and I think she will lose them.
3bQaEVmTaa	seriously dont get too comfortable. thats not really normal if hes acting this way. is he touching u? give u funny looks?|`|F3iEnj2Caa	I hope you don't mean you like him as in a relationship way because if the connect you have with him is all about your bad moments in life, than thats not love, its pity. Sorry to sound so harsh, but its true. :|      edit: i dont you shouldnt be that worried so far. it doesnt seem serious. maybe he just likes you as student, nothing wrong.  but if you seem worried about this situation dont continue talking to him as more than a teacher. dont let him know about your personal life. view him as just another teacher. this will make you feel less uncomfortable.|`|zygejRlSaa	I am like that with one of my teachers but i don't like him at all he is more of a dad then anything else just be careful especially if he is young and just be aware you could get him in trouble.

1ezYfkX7aa	Your right....i think if raped...it has nothing to do with the baby...the baby didnt rape you. If you didnt want to have a baby out of rape then you can at least give it up for adoption. This way you dont have a baby anymore and someone else gets blessed with a much wanted child and the baby has a chance at life.|`|4xDDR7c3aa	you are asking this question in the wrong section. MANY women are going to anger twards someone who would post anything about abortion in a pregnancy section where most people are pregnant or trying to concieve. What mother or mother to be wants to read about Abortion! Move your question!!!  ADD: I dont think anyone really cares where you put it, your bringing up a touchy subject, if you dont like the negative responses and people asking you to move your question then dont post it at all!|`|wKJrZhj3aa	wow. this topic is intense. As much as abortion is a subject that pertains to pregnancy, i think this discussion of the topic is misplaced.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i think what most are saying is that while it still would be wrong, it would be more forgivable. its hard to say unless you are actually the one raped and pregnant. i just dont believe in abortion at all but i guess i could understand it better for a raped woman than a selfish person using it as a form of birth control instead of taking responsibility and rasing the child or giving it up for adoption|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	I don't think this is an appropriate place for this question, but I will tell you this. I would never get an abortion if I were raped. Why should the child become the 2nd victim of this horrible situation right? I think abortion in all circumstances is murder.
lU8e0VQFaa	If he comes from a bad living situation, even if you don't see any 'bad' behavior I would get him some therapy, just to make sure that he is just quiet and not the 'abused and hurting' type of quiet. Also, just be understanding, I mean, it's probably been a really big change for him too, give him some time to adjust.|`|zkovxRseaa	he is likely beginning masturbation, watch for that|`|SRVsnAxIaa	Are you sure hes not into girls? Cause most kids are, and that's normal. If he's a normal 14 year old boy, he's into girls, which may pose a problem to you.|`|jn34aSgHaa	you need to be carefull with those girls that you have because he might tell you that he dosent like girls but it could not be true and plus boys at that age are really sexual jut be carefull and tell your girls also. good luck|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Normal is a hard word to define -- especially in this day and age. Find out from him want he likes. Then if he is a reader, give a gift card to Amazon.com. or a local book store. Provide privacy with all those girls around. Haha. I only have girls too, but I teach a lot of boys at school. Try to give him a chance to explore new things while at the same time doing familiar things too. Ask him about his school activities, and keep in close touch with the school. U can check grades on line now in a lot of school systems. Let him have friends over as much as possible, so U can see who he hangs out with. If he is a quiet kid count your blessings and make sure he has some electronic gadgets of his own. Computers should be in "public" spaces in your home to prevent forbidden sites. Good luck.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Normal is what he perceives to be normal. Normal can varies from one person to another, if he likes video games, then that's normal for him.
BUI9HnH1aa	its nothing to worry about , <br>  i tested positive for group b strep to , and all they do is give u some antibiotics to make sure the baby doesn't get it as its being born <br>  Alot of women have group b strep.<br>  there is only a problem with it when they dont know u have it and the baby gets it ,|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You wouldn't have a stillbirth with beta strep, you'd just have a very sick neonate if you are not given antibiotics during labor - that's all.   I had beta strep (group B is for beta) with my first pregnancy, I got intravenous antibiotics, which you will be given, after my water broke prematurely (without labor), it took 28 hours for him to be born and he had no problems at all!   This baby will be fine, that's why they do the test and why they do prophylactic antibiotics before delivery as well.|`|SRzswqTeaa	Group B Streptococcus  is a bacteria which many women carry in the vagina with no symptoms at all, while for others it can cause infections in the uterus or the urinary tract. <br>  It is thought that 10-30% of women in the UK carry GBS in the vagina. <br>   As women in the UK are not normally screened for GBS routinely in pregnancy, the vast majority of women who carry GBS during pregnancy and birth will never know about it, their labors will not be managed any differently, and they and their babies will be none the worse off. <br>  <br>  A proportion of babies pick up GBS from the birth canal during labour, and again, for the vast majority of these, it will not cause any problems at all. However, a small minority of babies go on to <br>  develop Group B Strep Disease, more technically termed Early Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Septicaemia (ENGBSS), which is where the GBS infection causes blood poisoning. This can lead to meningitis and disability or death. <br>  <br>  GBS disease is very rare - in the UK, if the mother is known to carry GBS when she is in labour there is a 35-50% chance that her baby will pick up GBS, but only 0.2-0.5% of these babies will <br>  become will as a result. Putting these figures together, if a woman who is carrying GBS in labour has a 50% chance that her baby will pick up the bacteria.   The chance of the baby developing GBS disease is between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1,000. <br>                 <br>  Some women are at far higher risk of having a baby affected by GBS disease than others. <br>           Babies who fall into certain groups have a higher risk of developing the disease:<br>  <br>    *Preterm babies (especially before 35 weeks, but also    before 37 weeks).<br>    *Mother having a fever during labor <br>    *Prolonged rupture of membranes - over 18 hours <br>    *GBS found in the mother's urine, not just the vagina <br>    *Mother having had a previous child with GBS disease <br>    *Rupture of membranes before 37 weeks <br>  <br>  Babies do not die during birth because of the bacteria.  If they contract it at all from the mother, they will be treated with antibiotics.  There is no study that proves that having an antibiotic during labor changes the outcome on the babies.  We do know that roughly 80,000 women are given IV antibiotics in the US for Group B strep, and the outcomes are virtually the same in the UK where they do not test and do not give IV antibiotics.  So are we just making more super bugs in this process?  I don't know.  Most women feel safer being given the antibiotics, and that is certainly up to them.|`|52U22fiAaa	still birth isn't really a risk factor w/group b strep.  It is an infection that you have that can pass to the baby during birth.  To minimize the risk of the baby getting it, they will put you on an IV of antibiotics during childbirth.  Most of the time the baby doesn't get it, if the baby does, then they will treat it accordingly.  Your doctors will take the measures necessary to be sure the baby doesn't get hurt, and she/he will be fine.  Good Luck.|`|LMc23g9Maa	I tested positive with my first.  As far as I remember, I had an extra needle to "cure" that but that's all.  No probs.  My doc said it was very common.|`|55AOkGa5aa	you wont have a still birth....i had that when i was preggo....they will give you antibiotics during labor so it wont get to the baby...good luck...|`|97361e0bea1a7c814e1e0591ab668edaaa	Don't worry about it, I tested positive for Group b strep also, I had my daughter last April now she is 21lbs and growing.Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy adults and in the vagina and/or lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy, adult women. All they are going to do is give you some antibiotic when you go into labor.The antibiotic (usually penicillin) is given to you through an IV (in the vein) during childbirth. Being a carrier for the bacteria does not mean you have an infection or a STD, It only means that you have group B strep bacteria in your body, usually living in the rectum or vagina
AA11763588	You can ask, but more than likely unless it is an emergency they won't. They prefer you go the whole 40 weeks.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Yes, they will; at least they will at 38 weeks. However, that is dependent upon a sonogram, if the baby is in position and your cervix has begun effacing they will more than likely go ahead with the induction. You are out of luck though if the baby is giving no indication that he is ready to come.  By the way, keep in mind if you are getting induced, it doesn't always work. I haven't had problems personally, but my best friend was induced once a week for her 39th, 40th and 41st week. She had to deal with the contractions for hours before they sent her home still pregnant twice, the third time the Doctor said the baby had gotten too big and went ahead with a c-section when the induction didn't work. In my own experience, the contractions hurt way more with induction than when you go into labor naturally. I would hold out for the due date if you can, you'lll have the rest of your life to spend with him, a few weeks isn't that long|`|gx4s68s8aa	Can a doctor do it and will a doctor do it are two completely different questions.  Yes, a doctor can do it if you haven't had any complications, but mostly likely a doctor will not do it.    I was induced at 38 weeks with my daughter and that was only because I had a blood clot in my leg (that was discovered in the 26 week) .  They almost had me go another week.  So that was a pretty serious complication and I had to go until 38 weeks.    So you can always ask.  But be prepared for a no as the answer.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I'm not sure. I got induced at 39 weeks and 5 days. It won't hurt to ask though. I would shoot for the 38 week mark just because the longer the baby is in there the better =) Good luck.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	You can ask. In Utah they gave me the option to induce at 37 weeks but I waited until 39w5d to induce to give my son more time to grow in there...  Good Luck.....|`|5f6XnInEaa	If you've had no complications all through, the chances of them letting you induce before you are due are quite minimal.    You can always ask, but I'd be prepared for the no.    Why would you want to go that early anyway?    Pregnancy is rough, but risking a child's health , or risking potentially needing a c-section  because the induction might cause fetal distress is a little but rougher.|`|5cd7d92999d5de22f8d5e5597eb9e350aa	Yes you can get induced, just ask your doctor, I turned 38 wks this past Sunday and I had asked my doctor to induce mea couple weeks ago , so i get induced on Friday,(38.4 wks). So go ahead and ask, besides once u get to 38 wks you are considered full term. Good luck.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Most doctors will not induce before 38 weeks unless there is a valid medical reason for doing so. I hate to tell you that unless you have a very understanding dr. & if this is your first they more then likely will not induce you at all unless you are overdue. If there are complications then they can justify this. With my first son i was induced at 37 weeks 4 days. Because they thought my son was going to be over 9lbs ( he was 6lbs 13 ozs)! With my daughter ( 3) they waited until I was 41 weeks 2 days before they finally decided to induce! But yes talk to your doc about this just to see how he reacts! You may get lucky! Best wishes!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	By this stage in the game, every women is pulling her hair out. Try having a 10.3 pounder go 40 weeks, 5 days. I wish we would of had a 6 lb baby.     Being induced is hard. And you don't want it. You may even end up having a c section baby. I would never be induced again. My 1st was induced and it was after 19 1/2 hours of hard labor ( due to being induced ) that I ended up having a c section. It was HORRIBLE.    Your 36 weeks pregnant, and you have made it this far. You only have a little ways to go ( I've had 2 babies. I know what being pregnant is like )
EMPVvJcDaa	The spots you are getting is called spotting. It is completly normal. I was on Nuva Ring for over a year and had no prolems with it. If he pulled out you should be fine, plus there is only certain days you can get pregnant. But to be safe you guys should definatly use protection. An unexpected pregnancy could really change your life.|`|AA11785285	Since you are following instructions to the letter, likely not.  But hon, to be absolutely sure, he ought to be using a condom with spermicide gel, too.    Have you and he discussed what would YOU REALLY do, if you became pregnant?????    And you ought to know, hon, because the choices are all bad.

s4LWmcTjaa	It really depends on what my child did.  Different situations call for different methods.  I believe that consistent discipline from both parents on a united front is essential though.<br>  <br>  We tend to stick to these cores when disciplining our kids:<br>  <br>  1- The consequence must fit the misdeed<br>  <br>  2- There must be a learning experience <br>  <br>  3- We must make sure our children understand why their actions were wrong and that they are clear on what the consequences will be from that point on if that action is repeated again<br>  <br>  4- We should handle ourselves in a way that is pleasing to God when disciplining our children<br>  <br>  In any instance, we give two warnings before we give a consequence.|`|zfZiXQ3Oaa	Well, i'm having some problems with that at the moment...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlcQcx8Gm_YUGI93vYWiPorsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225145134AAu3i8p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I usually leave the discipline to my husband... he's a little harsh, and very strict.<br>  <br>  I usually give my daughter my opinion but i have no rules for her. we're more like friends than parent and child.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	They usually get a first warning, then a time out, then a spanking. It depends on what they do. If I tell them not to do something (first warning) and they continue to do it after I told them not to then they go to time out and if they continue to misbehave after they get out of time out then they will get spanked and put back in time out.|`|oFVjzgT9aa	First comes the warning of a time out, then the question if the child actually wants a time out, then comes the actual time out. When it is done, she is expected to appologize and say why she was given a time out. this way we make sure she understands what she was punished for. Then behavior is corrected (toys put away, etc.) and we end it with hugs and kisses and thank our daughter for doing as she was asked. <br>  If that does not solve the problem, priviledges are taken away. Like no cartoons, or going to the park, or no bed time story. If priviledges are taken away, fixing behavior does not bring privileges back until 24 hours later and show of corrected action. <br>  We make sure and explain how her actions have consequences, just like ours do. If she is not nice to us, we are not nice to her.....it works.|`|4iXL4C6paa	we do time outs, we take away privileages and toys, we make the oldest write sentences and sometimes we even spank *gasp*|`|A5sCcYdEaa	i do time outs spanking take away toys
wiAVa1H5aa	Sure sex helps, maybe - no study has backed semen as being that helpful in ripening a cervix.   Most midwives agree evening primrose oil caplets, 2-3, placed near your cervix before bedtime or a nap (since it will run out otherwise) will help ripen a cervix.<br>  <br>  But what helps the most is being ready, when women are not induced the typical first mom's actual delivery is 41.5 weeks.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sex honestly. Semen is very good for doing that. I'm not trying to be crass it's just the truth. :)|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	You really shouldn't do anything to induce labor without a professional, it could be dangerous for both you and the baby. I would advice you to talk to your ob/gyn about your options, if he/she doesn't feel you need to be induced yet there must be a reason for it. Good luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Ya, orgasm will work to help you out that way.  The contractions your uterus go through will help you out with speeding up labour a little bit.  Good luck!|`|52U22fiAaa	semen helps to soften the cervix.... so, sex.|`|kAdgwDFqaa	You should just let it happen on it's own
zuwicu9Baa	every thing changes after pregnancy. don't expect out periods to be how they use to be. before my first, my period would last for 3 days only it was great! after she was born i would get it HEAVY for 3 days then basically go away for about 2 days then come back quite heavy for another 2 days. my daughter is now 7|`|AA10405438	it's normal and will get lighter as the days go on.|`|75HzIpSraa	yes very common for it to be heavy and irregular at first. For some it takes many months to get back to normal!!|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	Yes, your lining has been so thick and healthy that it  relined to nourish baby that wasnt there. They will mellow out and get better. If you arent planning on having another one soon, get on the pill. It will lessen those cramps and help your flow lighten and be less days.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	Yes, it's normal.   I talked to the dr about it when I got mine a few months ago.   Please also be advised that you could bleed for a while. my first PPD period was 27 days long (I'm not talking about after having the baby. I'm talking period!! It sucked! )My obgyn said some women can bleed for up to 3 months on their first period!   Eventually it will go back to normal!
qERAKF13aa	im on the same page! i also am 35 weeks and i went through my "nesting" faze last week and still at home, but they say that you go into labor a few days to weeks after the nesting, so hopefully soon! good luck.
5DKl9u2Caa	Kinsli esabella sounds good to me..I like how it flows. surprisingly i didn't pick kimberly and that's my name...its too common. You want her to have a name that's unique but not outrageous. Im 20 years old and when in public I always hear the name Kimberly and I almost always think someone is calling me..that sucks. Also I like the spelling of Kinsli |`|ODMCAcPDaa	Kinsley is brilliant!  It's unique and feminine!|`|mxmOvLlsaa	hmmm... I like Jasmine. it's pretty, classy, and there r'ent any bad nicknames for it. Anything with a K kinda seems rough and sharp. not very friendly. Jasmine. i like Jasmine. (oh, and if u do want a nickname, there's Jazz and Minnie)|`|LdoCKo4Qaa	My advices is to choose Kinsley-Kalliebella.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Isabella.  It's the only one that I think sounds like a real name and not a fad name.  I always try to think of my childs future.  Imagine them turning in a resume with the name Jasmine on it.  Employer would probably throw it out.  They have actually done research on this and it's true.|`|7adzqyGgaa	Jasmyne (i like that spelling)|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I like Kallie, Jasmine and Kimberly.    Have you considered Kennedy?  That's one of my favorites!
AA11763588	It's just discharge. It's normal.    If it's green or brown, or smells funny it usually means there is an infection and call your DR or head to the ER.|`|awXx7N2baa	Discharge..|`|ebCzRLw7aa	Its just discharge.  its just your vagina cleaning it self.
bmoCpcdraa	walk up and down hall for 2 hours, they made me do that in hospital to induce labor i hope i helped|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Evening Primrose oil helps to ripen the cervix. Just poke a hole in the end of a couple of the gel caps with a clean needle and insert them as far up in the vagina as you can get them and then go lay down for about 30-60 minutes (depending on how much time you have to spare) that way the oil has time to really sit on the cervix. This has not induced my labor but it has certainly helped my cervix with ripening. I don't know anything from the castor oil, but I've heard mixed stories about it. I would try it if I was brave enough but I'm scared of the baby passing meconium in utero and of me crapping all over the place lol.|`|52U22fiAaa	How many weeks are you?  The baby will come when she's ready!  Anyway, just stay active and take walks.

TRUST ME! none of them work. baby will only come when he/she is ready seriously...TRUST ME! lol|`|AA10148408	i was told when i was pregnant (by a nurse) that walking helps induce.  don't do anything weird without calling your doctor|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I drank 2 cups of caster oil and orange juice...(half and half)!

ZIJvBQAMaa	Sounds like a yeast infection. Get Monostat from the drug store. It is common while prego. It is caused by excess moister and an imbalance. Your body is going through so many changes so that would explain it. The medicine will releave your itch right away and in a day or so it will be totally cleared. I have only had one so at first I was unsure if that is what it was or not. I figured I would try the medicine for $10 and then if that didnt work, I would go to the Dr. It worked and saved me from missing work and paying a visit Co-Pay plus perscription Co-Pay! :)|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I didn't realize you were pregnant probably normal, but check with your doctor before treating with over the counter medicine.|`|aES89pvwaa	Yeast infections are very common while pregnant. Your leaking in that area more than usually and wetness can be a cause of yeast infection. Just go get an over the counter medicine and make sure pregnant people can take it though!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Yes very common during pregnancy. I got it 3 times while i was pregnant. They usually wont give you the oral tablets while pregnant... they should prescribe the cream.|`|vOlGhIVTaa	your long lost penis|`|H7kmp0qdaa	yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis or trich... something. all 3 are not necessarily sexually transmitted and can cause itching.|`|ei6dMFYGaa	Alot of womenn get yeast infection while pregnant .. very important to get meds for could get seriouse!|`|tZxVey2baa	It sounds like a yeast infection because they really do itch a lot.|`|HdvMYsLwaa	it could have a lot to do with you being pregnant! if it continues go to the doctor!|`|NBK3s2LVaa	10 to 1 yes it is a yeast infection vaginal itching and discharge are the major symptoms of it|`|zd1gQmzvaa	your hubby has been screwing around with a dirty whore with the crabs...if you're lucky, that's all you caught from that cheating dirtball.|`|Ogu8kZGxaa	How do u know that for a fact hmmm but probably yeast|`|nzCxfFNyaa	its nothing i have a lot of pations that have this its nothing important just shave there and your gonna be good even if there is not a lot of (hair) then it will still cause this|`|73a09b7b481e5cdedd9103840eef86c1aa	its normal to get itchy sometimes when your pregnant you can but over the counter creams such as eurax or canesten (not sure about the spelling) its just a little thrush|`|AsICkz9naa	Yes it could be a yeast infection alright. Your doctor or pharmacist will be able to give you something for it. Just make sure you tell them that you are pregnant.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yep, yeast infections are very common during pregnancy.  Since you're not sure I'd recommend you call your doctor and have him/her do a pelvic exam and make sure it's a yeast infection and then he/she will prescribe the appropriate treatment.|`|yuAI037Iaa	I agree with everyone it sounds like yeast infection.  I would call your doc before getting anything.  Just ask what over the counter medication you can take while being pregnant.  you could even ask a pharmacist what medications you can take.  DO NOT USE VAGISIL.  I had a yeast infection with my third pregnancy and used that.  It set me on fire and i had more discomfort due to the cream than the itching.  If you want to try it then i would use a small amount and have a soapy rag just incase you react as i did.  I couldn't get to the bathroom fast enought to wash that crap off.  I am still traumatized by that stuff.|`|cb510696d0a5c4f47838f85e424ce421aa	It still could be a yeast infection. My ob treated me for one when I was 7 weeks pregnant, and the only symptom I had was itching. I would call your ob in the morning and inform them what is going on and they will either call you in a prescription or get you to come in. Don't worry yeast infections and bladder infections are very common in pregnancy. Best of luck.|`|AA11762804	rephresh =) or try vagisil if none of them work then talk to your doctor,|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	I get the same thing if I don't wear cotton panties! I am almost 24 weeks pregnant and ever since I began my 2nd trimester I get an "itch" down there from time to time. It could also be from increased hormones and blood flow!!

LOL!!|`|qxIUcKx1aa	well i'm 14 so let me see well you probaly might been washing your self with scented or not good soap, or tight pants, or junk food. eat lot of yogurt and mainly healthy food for now|`|1WRB7RPNaa	Always consult a doc for a question like this, their is no way of diagnosing you or telling you what to do unless your doc says to|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Get the anti itch cream, I think its called Vagisal|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Sounds like a yeast infection...you can get stuff over the counter for it or just make an appt with your doctor.|`|FSPAKELyaa	id guess its just yeast. I had that last week, i just went to the chemist and got treatment. its fairly common. make sure you tell the chemist you are pregnant so he can give you the right treatment, and if it doesnt go away talk to your lmc|`|tI0rkxeuaa	I've never had a kid, but a lot of my friends complained that they got thrush quite a lot when they were pregnant - more so than normal.|`|AA11763588	You probably have a UTI, either go to the DR for meds or drink some cranberry juice.|`|AA10405438	Vaginitis.  Do not use anything your doctor doesn't order.|`|87DaOGDIaa	yea it could be, my husband has that problem|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Could be a yeast infection or could be BV (bacterial vaginosis,) both of which can be common in pregnancy.  And yes, when you google BV it will fall in with the STD category many times...but that is not always the case.  Just a bacterial infection that happens sometimes.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	this is to do with  the pregnancy   I had the same problem when I was pregnant with my daughter   talk to your doc about it you will be prescrib something
21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	no... take it only on the days your doctor said to take it on. take a HPT to make sure you arent pregnant.

CKnHMYHnaa	If they did an ultrasound already and only saw one sac and fetus then you are only having one baby.  <br>  What is the fascination everyone seems to have with multiples?  It increases the risk of the pregnancy so much... why wish for a harder more complicated pregnancy?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If it's fraternal twins on your side, on your maternal side in particular (your dad and your husband's genetic legacy does not count here) then yes you have a greater chance then average, it would be even more increased then an average woman your age (your age increases the chance of fraternal twins).   It's pretty unlikely that a 2nd fetus was hidden on the ultrasound, that happens only when there is uterine crowding from determined multiple births.|`|aeuWwrehaa	yes my friend  was told she was having twins but when they came there was a 3rd hiding, they say twins usually skip a generation.|`|0KGriIC7aa	due to family history your chances are very high. it is possible to have an ultrasound and have one hidden.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	It is your Mother's family that will determine if you have higher chances of having twins.

plI0WOrUaa	The more expensive pt is more accurate.  The reason you are paying more money is not just for the name, but for the sensitivity of the test.  The pricier ones tend to be more sensitive to picking up pregnancy hormone.  To be sure though, make a dr's appointment for a blood test.  That will be the most accurate.|`|bTlhBX3daa	If the Clear Blue Easy Digital said pregnant, that means that it picked up on HCG (pregnancy hormones) in your urine. That is more trustworthy than the other 3 cheap tests that say not pregnant. <br>  <br>  Call your Dr. and make an appt. to confirm, but I'd have to say you are pregnant.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	pregnant means pregnant. buy some prenatals and call your dr!|`|3SRH0p06aa	u dont get a false positive.|`|N3dMB1n6aa	You very rarely get a "false" positive result with those.  Different tests have different sensitivity levels, so I would bet that you are, and that the cheaper tests arent as sensitive as the Clear Blue.  The most sensitive test on the market is the First Response (pink package).  The digital are not always the best.  If you buy the regular one with the lines, even a faint line means its positive.  (been there four times!)  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are pregnant. The REAL reason the cheaper tests said negative is because you didn't have enough HCG left in your urine to read a positive.<br>  <br>  The only difference (and some people dont' like to actually acknowledge this) between the more expensive tests and the cheap ones are cost and packaging. I used three Dollar Store tests (yes, DOLLAR store) tests 4 days before my missed period and got positives. Cost means nothing but you can't test so close together when you are in early pregnancy because you won't have enough of the pregnancy hormone built up in your urine to read positive.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	digital test.

Pregnant women are one of the most beautiful things in the world in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Your body gets filled out, you get that pregnancy glow, your skin, nails and hair get lustrous and healthy. You are never more healthy than when you are pregnant. And who cares about the weight anyway? Many men like larger women, and even the one's who don't, well, heck, you are carrying a beautiful child in there. Your body is MAKING a human life. What is sexier than that??? Take it from another pregnant woman, enjoy this time while it's here, cause you might miss it later. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how to answer your second question because I'm not sure what you mean by uncomfortable.

It can pass if you allow yourself to think positive. I think you should get yourself a new out fit or two or if that's not possible, just put On one of your favorites. Put on a little make up and do your hair nice. Maybe make a nice dinner for your boyfriend and appreciate the little things in life. A child is a blessing so its weird that we find ourselves feeling this way during such a wonderful time. I also suggest you try different positions that may not make you feel so uncomfortable or wear something that's desirable yet still a little loose fitting and comfortable.

If you look confident and dress nicely, you will feel alot better!<br>  <br>  Pregnancy hormones will make you feel funny - don't presume that your boyfriend is not "satisfied" with you...he is probably just so excited, and maybe a little nervous about being a Dad that he has forgotten to remind you how amazing you are - remind him how incredible you are!<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|eRP2IAYcaa	to raise you confidence do the things that you want to and would like to do ya know. and there is nothing more sexy than a woman that is pregnant to me that is very beautiful, and i wouldnt feel so self conscious about it <br>  <br>  and for the satisfaction when you are comfortable about it and ready do it look up things like tips that will help|`|AIwDdAKcaa	experiment with different positions - you'll find one that works for you.  studies have actually shown that men are supposedly more attracted to pregnant women, due to hormonal changes and psychological effects of seeing themselves in you (quite literally).<br>  <br>  the spooning position, side by side, sitting on the edge of the bed or other surface or from behind are likely to be somewhat easier, given less pressure on your stomach and varying angles of penetration that you control with greater ease - ensuring your own comfort.|`|5QDouy4Uaa	Your boyfriend should think your sexy no matter what. after all he is the one that knocked you up. as for helping him feel satisfied, everything I try to do makes me uncomfortable these days.

Whichever way makes you feel the best is what matters most now.<br>  <br>  There are many flattering maternity outfits out there...I personally like dresses, that will hug your body at the right spots, making you feel sexy in them.  I suggest spending some good money on them, so you feel better about youself.<br>  Maybe a mani-pedi?  Or a massage?  How about a whole spa day, including getting your hair and make-up done?

I am not sure how far along I was because I didnt realize I was pregnant.|`|f47HTHOkaa	Mine felt like period cramps. You will find that the same symptoms for PMS are about the same for pregnancy. I got them around 7 or 8 weeks....everyone is different. My first symptom was sore breast|`|GYczA6nraa	You could be PMSing, or you might start your period soon
5q9xcYAuaa	Yes. Anytime you have sex its possible. And birth control only works 99% when used correctly. Missing 3 pills could easily throw you off. There's a chance, take a test to see.
4jW9rERFaa	Anytime after an exam or intercourse or other sexual activity you can spot. If they did the ultra sound with the probe stick internally you can spot from that also. Anytime you are spotting a light pink color blood there is not much if anything to be concerned about. If the color of the blood changes to a deep red that would be a concern as that would indicate possibility of a miscarriage. I've had one so I know what color blood is a problem. Bottom line is that if doc says its okay and the heart is beating don't stress over it or that could end up leading to a miscarriage. Good luck with your pregnancy!|`|27Gx5JUZaa	It is very normal when your in your first trimester *1-13 weeks pregnant*<br>  I went through a similar situation, the only difference is i had cramps. Are you experiencing any cramps (similar to menstrual cramps). I went to the ER & i also heard the heartbeat, everything was normal. They discharged me with "Threatening Miscarriage," which is also very common & most of the time ends up in a normal pregnancy. <br>  The spotting can most likely be due to implantation bleeding if there's no cramps. If you had sex, that can also cause some light bleeding. Either way, if your doctor says your okay, you don't need to stress (besides that's not safe for your baby), just follow any directions or advice the dr gave you.<br>  good luck & congrats on your pregnancy|`|eRP2IAYcaa	my friend went threw that same thing and what it is is the placenta lowered and if you have been having sexual activities then it will aggravate it causing it to bleed so dont be worried alot of people are worried about their first so just calm and take it easy although that is hard to hear someone say and do|`|XVljoYZ5aa	It sounds like you have a UTI (uterine tract infection).|`|5jjGo6XTaa	thats normal if u r sexual active. and somtimes not i dont know y u spot even not bveing sexualy active but you do no worries ur fine. it will go away. same thing happeneds to 99% of pregnant women|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Stress won't help you or the baby that's true. The best thing to do is "try" to relax and keep an eye on it. Sometimes light spotting CAN be normal in pregnancy. Keep good contact with your doctor too. That might help.
oiJITSNZaa	um...m maybe you got preg back in Oct though I trust you would know if youre four months along!|`|0KGriIC7aa	your lmp was in october? you should call your doc with that irregular of periods.
YyPrmn9jaa	The answer to your question is YES!  Colds, the Flu and other types of infections or viruses can have a negative effect on both male and female fertility.<br>  <br>  A woman's menstrual cycle can be affected by changes in her body chemistry (such as illness) and a man's sperm-making abilities can also be hampered for the same reason.<br>  <br>  If you are not already, you should start taking a prenatal vitamin and your husband should also take a multi-vitamin to boost his immune system.  <br>  <br>  Also try to get some light exercise (walking, swimming, cycling, yoga) and incorporate more fruits and vegetables into you and your husband's diet for an additional immune system boost!|`|oiJITSNZaa	No a cold should not affect your husband's sperm! Though a cold on your end could throw your system off. Why are you blaming him?|`|qPU5ZL5oaa	try to not kiss as much, and start taking vitamins if u havent started taking prenatal vitamins already.this has never happened to my husband and i, we keep kissing to a minimal,cheeks foreheads...and always take our vitamins and we're golden.it really shouldnt cause much of a problem but anything is possible.goodluck!
plI0WOrUaa	Everything is probably fine.  It is important to gain weight though.  If you don't gain enough weight, when you deliver the baby, you won't have enough strength to properly take care of the baby, and may have problems because you will be underweight.  If you were overweight when you got pregnant, the not gaining weight may make sense.  If you were average weight, I would try to eat a little more than you always have. Up your calorie intake with good vitamin rich foods to try and gain some weight.  Is your doctor concerned????  If not, ask him/her what they think about your weight.|`|AIwDdAKcaa	It depends on your starting weight above all else. However, consult with your doctor, who imagine would be commenting if there was a problem.  Nutritionally, you need to be taking care of yourself and if your weight loss is indicative of you not taking in proper nutrients and amount of food you need to get that taken care of ASAP so that the fetus's development in these last weeks is not negatively impacted.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	My sister-in -law is at about 29 weeks with twins. She has gained less than 10 pounds. Her doctor said it was normal because she had a lot of fat reserves pre-pregnancy, and also that its common with twins to gain a lot in the 3rd trimester. Consult your doctor, it's not healthy. Also increase your calories 100-200 a day because you are pregnant.|`|ffd293aab0fb04b2c3f99065cb53c6b8aa	What does your dr say<br>  <br>  If they know your baby is growing then things should be fine<br>  <br>  try eating more calories|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to eat more. You can't eat the amount you used to because your body and your baby needs more. Talk to your doctor. I'm sure he or she is concerned and has some tips for you.|`|4jW9rERFaa	Sometimes that just happens. I don't know why it happens but it does. I don't see anything wrong with it as long as you are doing what you say as in not doing anything different and not doing anything on purpose. My mom lost 20 pounds while pregnant with my youngest sister and she is perfectly fine. Perfect birth weight and everything. I am 21 weeks pregnant. So far I have lost ten and gained back 6 of those pounds in the last two months. I am not doing anything different either. I moved into an apartment in December so maybe the change has something to do with it.
AA11763588	Probably not. While false positives don't happen often, they do happen every once in a blue moon.    Try taking another test in a few days first thing in the morning.    Keep in mind that stress can delay a period.|`|hzlqCBWnaa	maybe your having a chemical pregnancy. usually after you get ur first positive the line only gets darker. i would retest or have a bloodtest done to check your hcg. goodluck|`|DWvnIYTEaa	wait a few more days and test again in the morning. Good luck|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Do not waste your money on digital tests unless you're willing to wait a week after you missed your period. I'm surprised you got a positive one out of the first one. They need more HCG so they're not as reliable as a regular test with lines.  Take another test in the morning.  Use a non digital one.|`|QRHufyHiaa	yes drinking alot of fluids before taking a pregnancy test can give you false results. its best to take the test with your first morning pee. rarely do you get a false positive. take another one tomorrow morning or get a blood test done.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	Its either that you ARE pregnant but you need first morning pee to get a positive at the clinic ( also they use different tests-some need 100 imu instead of 20 like first response). Or you are/were pregnant and your hcg is depleating because you are having a MC
c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	1 - I would rather have a sahm with experience than someone who is young and full of energy.  If my kid gets hurt, the buoyant, hipster isn't necessarily going to be of much service.  lol    2 - I guess I would prefer they go somewhere else.  I'm not really comfortable letting people in my house when I'm not there.    3 - I would like the home to be near my home.    4 - I wouldn't mind pets as long as they're clean and never left with my child unattended.    5 - I think either is fine.  A friend of mine was licensed and I've watched children unlicensed.  There are pros and cons to both.  For myself, it wouldn't matter as long as I felt I could trust the person watching my children.    6 - I would rather just pay for the time my kid is there.  I don't want to be penalized if I pick her up early one day.    7 - This is my own - I would prefer my children to be watched by a woman over a man.  I know that women can be child molesters, too, but I am very wary about leaving my daughters with a male caregiver.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I'd prefer a mom who would come to my home, but her home would be okay. She has to be near to me. I'd prefer no pets. I'd prefer unlicensed so she can devote more time to my child, and I'd prefer 1 flat fee so I don't have to worry about extras.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'd rather have an experienced babysitter - but that experience could also come in the form of a young person who nannied or something before.     I'd prefer for my child to be watched in my home, but I understand I can't always expect that.    I'd rather have daycare close to home or work.    Cats are fine but I don't want any dogs around. Personal preference.    I would rather have a licensed daycare.    I would prefer all-inclusive fees. The details get too muddy for me.    My other thought is the number of children in the daycare. I'm not comfortable with large daycares, I'd prefer a child to be watched in a home. But I'd prefer to not have more than 2-3 children there total.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	1)    A without a doubt!    2)    I would be open to B yes. It gets my daughter out of the house and used to new places.    3)     to me 15 minutes is not fair, so I wouldn't mind that    4)     Well she loves animals, so as long as the pets where clean and friendly, It would not bother me    5)     Erm I think I would like A.  That way you know that they are good at their job, and have been checked by the proper services.    6)     I pay my child minded 765 euro a month. That includes food for my daughter, and creative supplies she keeps there, including bored games and such.    Another thing I love about my carer, is she is so safety conscience for the children.  She minds 4 children in her home, including my daughter.  And she never releases them to whoever is picking them up, unless it is the usual parent, without verification that the normal collector is not going to be picking the child up.  For example, if I can't pick up my child, I either tell her in the morning, or ring her before the day is over to say such and such is coming to collect my daughter.  Then that person, has to produce valid ID to her, when they get their.  Like, my carer wouldn't know my daughters father really, so he always has to produce drivers license when he picks her up.    That might not seem important to others, but I feel it is a great Idea, cause you can never be to careful now a days|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	1. Somewhere between A and B. I use a SAHM with kids my own son's age.    2. Doesn't matter. In my home would be fine with me, but I'm perfectly happy taking my son to daycare.    3. I drive about 25 minutes, but if it wasn't on my way anyway, I probably wouldn't.    4. I have no problem with my son being exposed to pets of any sort.    5. I like having just a couple kids around. I'm not comfortable with one adult watching more than five pre-schoolers. I don't feel like my son gets the same level of care.    6. One all-inclusive rate is good, but I like having a part-time rate and a full-time rate so I can pay less when my schedule allows me to be home more. Most daycares in my area only have full-time rates.     I like a small, family atmosphere. Lots of activities, like going for walks and field trips, nutritious meals, and flexibility. Good discipline is important, too. If you're going to watch someone else's kids every day, you need to be comfortable disciplining them. I once looked at a daycare and rejected it because the provider kept threatening time-outs to kids that wouldn't stop kicking each other but never followed through.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	in my search for a childcare provider I found that I was the best person for the job. so I stay home until they are all in school.|`|H1ubEdiTaa	easy, my wife. she meets or exceeds all issues you have listed.

A047edhvaa	Well my due date is 5-24-09 and my LMP was 8-17-08 and women "usually" ovulate about 14 days after that.  Which means that I probably conceived about 14 days after that on 8-31-08.    If the first date you gave of 5-20-09 is correct then your LMP is 8-13-08 and you probably conceived on 8-27-08.  If the second date of 5-27-09 is correct then your LMP is 8-20-08 and you probably conceived on 9-3-09.    I can only base it on the generalizations they give you about when women "on average" ovulate, but if you have a longer or shorter cycle it could make a difference up to a few weeks.|`|zFb022Iiaa	40 weeks you go back|`|7SKVCPcSaa	38 weeks before that|`|IvU7WH8baa	if ur trying to figure whos the daddy i believe they have dna test for unborn babies now.|`|754b5669f7d51e2b7739ea88b243aea1aa	Yahoo conception calculators it will help you figure things out.

ruczpWrGaa	well there isn't much you can do.  they are her parents, they get to make the choices.  The best thing you can do is stay in contact with her.  Let the parents know how you feel.

Otherwise stay in contact and focus on your education.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	its strange, her own parents are humiliated by their own grandchild. they can't send her away knowing you're the father, you do have every right. i would confront them about it, maybe bring your parents into this and if they still don't come around. i guess get the police involved.|`|HMg97Fxjaa	There is not much you can do. To be honest, there is nothing you can do. She's not technically an adult, and she is still under the support of her parents, so she has to do what her parents tell her. If they don't want to you near her, then you have to listen to them. If you keep begging to see her then they'll get annoyed and start ignoring you. If you must see her, then just politely ask her parents and reason with them. It's hard for parents of a pregnant teenage daughter to not stress about this or over react. Just take a chill pill and do your best to cope. Sorry, there really isn't anything you can do now.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Your damn lucky they haven't pressed charges on you for statutory rape.<br>  They are her parents, which means they are in charge of her.

So that was a bit of a downer. I know that sounds really negative but that was my experience with it, I kinda wish I hadn't got one but I was in so much pain I wasn't really thinking.<br>  Just keep an open mind hun, cos you can make and decide how your want your labour to go (ideally) but things can change on the day.

A lot of people just decide to get an epidural because its there, if you don't need it don't get it that's my belief. it has side effects like all other drugs, you will lose all feeling from your stomach down, you wont know when you are pushing and this could endanger you as well as your baby.

I decided to have an epidural because I was scared I might have to have a c-section (which I did).  I knew if I didn't have the epidural that they would put me to sleep if something happened and they had to do an emergency c-section.  I wanted to be awake to see my baby.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	im due on monday and every person I've talked to has said go for the epidural. My mom went natural with my sister and me and she said it hurt like hell. it just depends on your pain tolerance and personal opinion. <br>  <br>  I'm opting for the epidural|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Decide now because it can progress to the point you are too far along to get one.<br>  <br>  Our OBGYN said the most important phrase you need to remember is "I want my epidural".
Ka52nbhNaa	Our IVF twins will be 6 months old tomorrow and we were blessed on our first try . . . so that is a success!  My daughter is currently playing in her exersaucer, my son has a cold, is teething, needs a nap and is driving me nutty . . . but they are so worth it!<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it was a long road for us to reach IVF.<br>  <br>  Here is my IVF experience:<br>  After 2 1/2 years of trying, a year and a 1/2 on our own and a year with the RE - 3 IUI's with Clomid and 3 IUI's win injectible medications that all ended in failure - we completed our first IVF cycle in December 2007. The egg retrieval was on December 25 - what a way to spend Christmas - under anesthesia!<br>  <br>  I worked my entire cycle (more or less). The cycle started with a couple of weeks on the pill to supress my cycle followed by Lupron and Gonal F injections. The injections were not bad - I did not personally have any major side effects, no mood swings, just some discomfort at the injection site and a bit of bloating. Our RE has early morning hours so when it was time for bloodwork or ultrasounds, I was able to go in around 7AM, get it done and head to work without having to let my boss know. I am not sure the exact number of appointments (it is tucked away in my journal) but I would estimate 6 - 7. It was a pain not actually knowing when the retrieval would be because they monitor you, monitor you, monitor you and then tell you . . . ok, do the trigger shot tonight and come to the office in 2 days. IVF scheduling takes over your life. <br>  <br>  It's Christmas Day - I had to tell my family we wouldn't be coming . . . Here is my actual experience for the egg retrieval-We arrived at the office at 8:30 AM, got changed into a hospital gown and they checked the blood pressure and took my temp. When I went into the procedure room, they put me under anesthesia and then it was over. I think I was under for about 15 minutes. I woke up in recovery. I stayed in recovery for about an hour, they let me eat crackers and drink some water. When I was ready, DH got the car, pulled it around to the front and I walked easily from recovery to the car.<br>  <br>  As to actual pain - not too bad - I compare it to slight cramping and the sensation of doing too many crunches at the gym. Sore in the mid section. The anesthesia did a number on me, I spent the rest of the day sleeping on the couch. The next day was better - gradually the soreness started to fade. <br>  <br>  Transfer was a breeze - the worst part was hanging out with a full bladder while they transfer the embryos. It was much like an IUI / slightly worse than a pap smear but not terrible.<br>  <br>  My advice is to not read into everything. They only retrieved 11 eggs and only 2 fertilized - much less than we were hoping for. Instead of going for a 5 day blastocyst, they did the transfer of both embryos at day 3. It definitely felt like things were going wrong . . . but in the end we got the good news!<br>  <br>  We got our BFP on January 8, 2008. AND found out on January 29th that we were expecting twins! If you are uncomfortable with multiples, you don't have to transfer more than one embryo . . . I have a friend who had a successful IVF and only transfered one because she was not comfortable with a multiple birth.<br>  <br>  Our twins will be 6 months old tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, I hope your treatments go as smoothly if it becomes necessary.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Ill answer for my mom, my youngest sister is an IVF baby.<br>  <br>  1. Yes totally, she was well wanted.  She was a twin but the other baby stopped forming at 4 months pregnant.<br>  <br>  2. She said not too bad at all except for the many miscarriages.<br>  <br>  3.  Took 5 years for a full term pregnancy.  She accepted the eggs many times but after just a few weeks would miscarry.   Keep in mind, her tubes were tied and she was 38 years old so that does play a factor sometimes.  Would she do it all over again? In a heartbeat.
kaqPSgTVaa	So you got a positive? If so then yes that's all normal. Welcome to pregnancy.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	To be honest I felt nothing until I was 12 weeks...<br>  Alotta people normally get sick between 6-9 weeks, so maybe your just sick? See a doctor man... its probably constipation by the sounds of it|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You did not say what the pregnancy test results were??? Anyway if you are pregnant the weeks start from the first day of your last period and go from there. Missing your period is a sure trigger to get you wondering if you are pregnant and the constipation is one of the first symptoms I had even before my morning sickness which lasted from weeks 6-8. the cramping is something to keep an eye on but that should not last long. Good luck|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	The big question here is what was the result of the 4 pregnancy tests? If they were positive then yes, it's normal. Either way you need to schedule an appointment with an ob/gyn asap-if you're pregnant, you'll want to start taking prenatal vitamins right away.

As their vision is still black and white they are interested in the contrast of the two colours, you could do a drawing yourself with a black vivid and white piece of paper, or if you have white cardboard you can fold it and then do drawings on it to make a small book.  You could do pictures like a flower with a face, a sun with a face, a dog.  If you are wanting to buy something you could look for a soft fabric book with black and white images, a black and white mobile, or a black and white soft toy.
bD3XFJQSaa	Hi Angela,<br>  I grew up very close to you so I am familiar with Lodi.  I am a foster parent now and I know that the state seems very cruel when the baby is taken away.  It is a blessing to receive a social worker who truly cares about your situation.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your question is because your story was quite long and unfinished.  However, whatever you are required to do by the state, do it ASAP and to the best of your ability so that you can regain custody of your baby.  I do think it is absolutely RIDICULOUS that your grandma would have to divorce her husband in order for the baby to stay there.  That shouldn't even be an issue!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Ummm...Lot's of information here and I am assuming that you ran out of room. I'm not really sure what your question is here. Small amount of corn syrup I know that is very common with a gassy or constipated baby. <br>  <br>  Why did cps take Noah away from you, you didn't explain why they just took him they won't just take him for no reason. Email me if you need someone to talk to.|`|Y6YaMR34aa	wow! um i don't know maybe you should try some different doctors so they can give you a different perspective on how noah's doing.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It has happened to some people before but is very rare.  I very much doubt it because you came on your period.    xx
dCLnLlsCaa	I've never heard of that, however you should always try to buy deodorant that is aluminum free like Tom's.  Aluminum causes cancer.
cb510696d0a5c4f47838f85e424ce421aa	You really should give your body time to heal after having a baby. Doctor's normally tell you to wait 12 to 18 months after deliver to start trying again.

cAtWxJG1aa	it's irritating to take criticism for doing what you know to be best for your child.    but your performance review comes from your child, not anyone on this forum.      but at any rate, harassment from a troll doesn't even count.  it's not as if they need a reason.|`|TQW5E6olaa	C'mon Texas :) I know you must have learned that on Yahoo Answers, no matter what your stance, if you vocalize it, people will oppose it. I'm learning it still :)    I think it's the unofficial slogan of Yahoo Answers actually...    Ignore them, how could they possibly know what's right for your children and family? Only you and hubby know that.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Who is doing that?  someone here or in real life?    Either way who cares what people think.  You are doing whats right for your family, that is what matters.    dear lord he has a new account.  some people need a serious hobby.  maybe he'll read this - heres one for you: real life frogger.  give it a try.|`|rjVALevtaa	I find it odd that other people would have an issue with you choosing not to spank your child. You have a valid reason why aren't spanking your son and no one should judge you for it.     My guess is that some people feel that a child is not being disciplined if they aren't getting spanked. These people should be ignored. Only you and your husband know what is best for your child.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I think it's great that you can recognize it's not the best idea for you to be spanking if you feel it might be a little out of control. A lot of parents aren't able to recognize it and things get bad.    Try not to pay attention to the one guy...i've noticed him harassing you a lot lately. He gets his kicks off of trying to bully people through a computer...he's coward and doesn't deserve anyone's time or energy.    As for the others...people here are just opinionated. Which i'm sure you know. This place is definitely not for people who take everything to heart.    You're a great parent if you're this aware of how things are going and how you're reacting to certain things and are able to change it so your child is still in a good and disciplined environment.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow that's crazy... but just remember the term "damned if you do damned if you don't" it's very true.  I think it's awesome that your able to look out for the best interest of your child... just ignore people like that, you know what your doing is right and that's all that matters. People are so judge mental and alot of them think their way is the ONLY way of doing things, I just assume to cut people out like that and completely ignore them.|`|28WJwHf4aa	I actually applaud you for being able to realize that you are not at a state of mind to take on a physical form of discipline. I think it's very wise that you choose to let your husband spank instead. I wish there were more parents out there like you, who aren't in control of spanking, yet continue to do so.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I am a spanker but I applaud you for not doing it, and knowing that you should never spank out of anger.|`|VAsZQtREaa	Does anyone on this site actually know you in person? Do you they know anymore about you than what you can fit into the allotted space for a question or answer? Then don't take their comments to heart. It's just preposterous to me to attack someone for a decision you very humbly made out of the best interest of your child. Rather than being too prideful to realize that your anger sometimes gets the best of you, you wisely recognized this problem and resolved to do something about it.     Personally, I am opposed to spanking, and as someone who grew up in Sweden where it has been illegal all my life it's always baffling to me that so many people here support it. I'm not attacking parents who spank because I realize that there are cultural differences and that some view it as effective, but I most certainly understand why a mother would chose not to. You aren't alone. One of the reasons it was made illegal here is because far too many parents were spanking in anger or causing harm, often unintentionally. If you ever come here you will see that our children are for the most part well-behaved and that the crime rate is low, so a lack of spankings for the past 30 years hasn't been to our detriment.     All this put aside, you sound like you are trying hard to be the best mother you can be, and you don't deserve to be attacked by a bunch of strangers. If I were you, I would simply block the people who harrass you and just carry on with your day. Don't give them the satisfaction of being bothered.|`|I2e4LFF9aa	I wouldnt spank. Thats abuse
tnhF5Gaiaa	I like shopping alone mostly because when I go shopping I buy a ton of stuff so I wouldn't want my friend just watching me try on and buy a ton of clothes. I'll go shopping with my three best friends though because we are all addicted to shopping and drop a lot of money on our shopping trips.

wZAeBisbaa	A 3 page buddy list?  Wow. I have exactly four buddies.      Turning the printer off won't help because it will just start her print jobs when you turn it back on, and they will be ahead of yours in the queue.  But you can go to "control panel" on your computer and click on "printers" and then delete her jobs.  There may also be some way to block jobs from a specific computer, but I don't know for sure.  You could try to uninstall the printer on her computer, but I don't know what would stop her from re-installing it.     Or, buy your own ink cartridges and remove them from the printer when you're not using it.|`|NuiHXYuOaa	show your mom this.    Mother your being unfair to the eldest child - ALWAYS THE CASE!

XOtOMncwaa	Mine has honestly been in my trunk for like 3 months. But it was very handy in the summer time if I was going to be outside. I've never even put it up in my own house, and I kept it at my moms for a while, but I like to take it if someone has to keep him for a while that way they can get a break from him running around. There a good thing to have, maybe not the most useful, some people use theirs all the time, I don't use mine alot, but I would feel lost if I were outside without it. I always take it to cook outs with me, and it ends up being a party of babies in my sons pack n play. It's really up to you.    *mine also comes in handy when I travel, we travel quite a bit, so I always make sure to take it*|`|l7RJkc3baa	I love my play yard, I dont know what I would do without it.I leave it in my leaving room...and bring my baby down during the day... she plays there and i do things around the house.

Most come with a detachable changing table, which I used a whole lot more than the fancy changing table in my nursery suite.  My daughter also slept in her pack and play a whole lot more than she slept in her crib.  Once your baby is able to creep around on his or her own, you can stick him in there while you take the odd second for yourself to pee or heat up a bottle.|`|R9AAhsIjaa	We didn't have a changing table so my in-laws bought us the Graco Pack-N-Play with the changing station on it. We used it when our daughter was a newborn (she slept in it in the living room during the day for a few months) and as a changing table for about six months. We never used it to contain her (God forbid, she screams like she's being beaten when you put her in it) so now we just use it as a bed on overnight trips to Mawmaw and Nana's house. It's probably not necessary, but it sure is nice to have!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I really like the pack and play, for playtime esp. when my son was a bit younger, and it's great for travelin too (i used it at my grandparents house durin Christmas vacation).  I think it's a very good thing to have for playtime when u can't be right there to watch them and for travelin (even if u don't think u'll be travelin alot, even a child as old as 3 or 4 could use it for a bed when u travel esp. if they are still used to sleepin in a crib at home.  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|XT3uyW5kaa	I'm shopping for baby stuff too =D. I asked my mom and she said, for me, it's good. I have a huge family and am constantly visiting people. When the baby starts sitting up, and can crawl, you'll need it. You can't keep the baby in a car seat or swing at your friend's and family's places. It will want to move once it can. Unless you're going to hold it the whole time, a play yard is the way to go. They still have a few feet of room to move around, but they're constantly in your view.|`|44OH7Si6aa	I love the pack n play. We travel quite a bit to see relatives and rent a cabin in state parks a couple times a year and we couldn't live without the pack n play as our portable bed. Also, it's great for when you send the little one over to grandma's or auntie's for the weekend. Baby Kara is due in 5 weeks but her brother and sister spent lots of time in their pack n play, especially when I wanted them safely separated from older cousins who tend to not watch for little babies when running around.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I have a pack-n-play that is also a bassinet.  It is great because when he was a newborn I used the bassinet and now that he is 10 months I can sit him in the pack-n-play while I shower and not worry about him doing anything naughty!  I wasn't sure I would use it either, but I am so glad someone bought me one anyhow!  Because I use it every day.  Sometimes he will even want to play in there!  So yes, it is a great investment.  You can use it for a long time without them being able to climb out!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my daughter who is now 4 1/2 spent alot of time in her pack n play with toys and such. she would love to play in there and it helped me to get things done.  my son who is now 5 weeks uses the bassinet part in the pack n play to sleep in - and we have the one that has the changing table attached to it. i plan to keep him in it for a few more months and then move him into the crib.  i know that his pack n play will be very useful for him as he gets bigger to play in.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I don't know if you are talking about play yards as pack-n-play type products, or as in the fence type products.    We used a pack-n-play with the bassinet insert as our baby's bed until he was about 6 months old when we moved him into his crib.  After that, we used it a handful of times while we were traveling as a portable bed.  Aside from that, though, we didn't use it much.  My son never liked using as a play pen since it is so confining and always keeps him away from us and all of the fun stuff we do.|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	We actually used ours in our room while my son slept in our room. We love it and it gets used when we have to go out of town and have to stay in hotels. But you can use the bassinet strictly. Some people use them for when they get older as a play pen. I don't think it is necessary. congrats!!!!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	They come in handy, especially when your baby starts crawling.  I used it to contain my "scooting" baby when I'm cooking, so she can't get near the stove.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	I love my Pack N Play would not traid it in for the world|`|AA11637178	You don't need one but they are nice to use when you go out side. This way you don't have to sit and hold the baby or try and make the baby stay on the banket.  Also when they start walking and you need to do something (but you can't be holding the baby) This way the baby stays safe.
5f6XnInEaa	You can refuse!    Finally, a question where someone isn't begging to be induced, I say kudos to you.    If there is no medical reason, flat out say no.    If she has to start chasing you around the room with cervical gel, and a pitocen drip...just run away!    I can't believe some of the doctors these days.    She has a medical Degree! She knows better than anyone else if that baby is not ready to come out, your going to have a c-section if the induction fails.    A lot of doctors now are rush rush rush...and truth be told, she probably has a holiday she'd like to go on, and your due date coincides with that, therefore she has to make you have the baby before she leaves!    I once again say kudos to you, if only there were more people like you!|`|bT4npA7Jaa	The doctor is a proffessional and he knows what he is doing. You don't want to deliver too late because it could harm the bab dramatically. And you're exactly right. There are not medical reasons for him to do this, but there isn't anything wrong with it either. My sister was induced 1 week early without complications, and her baby still weighed 6 Ib, 15 oz. I think you should listen to him. And believe me, it is easier to naturally deliver if the baby is a bit smaller than it would be a week later, because that last week or two are the ones where the baby grows most. Just listen to the doctor. He knows.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	He may suspect a future complication. But doesn't want to worry you. If you want,get a second opinion.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Just say no, you will not be doing that and want to go into labor the normal way. Call and leave a message with the nurse, the DR will get the message.|`|6avKnzkoaa	You have your right to have a natural delivery and not be induced. However, before rocketing off at your doctor, you should tell her of your concern about induction and then ask her if there is no medical reason then why would she want to induce you. And to ask if she can give you a reason why. Perhaps there is something, but she just doesn't want to say. Make her give you a proper answer.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	6lbs, means the baby is already starting to get big & they put on ALOT of weight in the last few weeks.      doctors are able to tell if your body is able to have a natural birth on your due date & they can normally predict how big your baby is going to be.. if they have schedualed an induction, then there HAS to be a reason, you should have asked while you were there!!|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Just say no or try asking if there's a medical reason for it.  He can't make you.  Maybe he's got plans or something when you're due.  He's been pretty rude with you so that's nothing to worry about.  If I were you I might've considered switching doctors ago months ago.|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Find out why he wants the induction, it could be for medical reasons.  If not just tell him you would rather wait till at least the due date.      If he won't listen to you try talking to some of his nurses or hospital staff themselves.  Its a little late to get a new doctor but you could always call around and try if you feel he is really ignoring your needs.|`|DutTBV3caa	i would just be rude. the doctors being rude already by not giving you the time you need to make you understand her suggestions. maybe just when she first walks in the room before she has a chance to say anything speak up and say "i'm having a few concerns about blah blah"  as a doctor its her job to make sure you're fully informed about everything going on. dont let her rudeness leave you uniformed!  and if you can't get her to talk to you, try a nurse. i've found that nurses are usually more concerned about the people rather then just the baby.    good luck!|`|3ay0KVVDaa	Stand FIRM on your decision PLEASE! you need to tell her NO and who cares if she gets annoyed! when they induce you early it raises the chances or a c-section because your body is NOT ready to deliver. I was induced and ended up havign a c-section.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	tell her you  if there is no medical reason to do it you prefer to go naturally or at least until your due date .|`|avx7bLnKaa	justvtell her you've done research on inductions and complications and would like to go into labor naturally    you are the client/patient you have a right to refuse or accept treatments|`|5UcdeeX8aa	1/2 of inductions do not work and end up in c-section, they are also more painful and you will likely want an epidural which comes with a 25% risk of c-section as well. You have rights, and your doctor doesn't get to decide what kind of labor you will have unless it is medically necessary. You should tell her that you prefer to let nature take its' course and go into labor on your own. Tell her at 41 wks you will agree to an induced labor unless there is an actual medical need for it before then. "We don't like you to go over your due date" is a great way of saying, "I'd rather deliver you during office hours" ... It's good for your doctor, but it comes with risks and you are right to decline.  I've been induced- pitocin contractions hurt, I could not breathe well with them, and it's a long labor at that. Stick to your gut.|`|kxSz1PYmaa	You're paying for your time with that Dr.  I would just state at the start of your next visit that you have some concerns you really need to discuss with him before the visit is over.  It might be helpful to have all your questions/concerns as to why he is wanting to induce prior to 40 weeks written down.  That way you have everything in front of you that you need to know and you have made your point at the start of the visit that he needs to stay and not rush out.  I agree with you that if there is no medical reason to induce you should be able to wait it out until you go past your due date and then there would be a reason.  He may be doing this for scheduling purposes and knows he will be out of town or something the week of your due date, but that is still up to you whether to induce or accept an on-call Dr.  You have every right to be informed of his reasons.
YgDKvY7Raa	First of all im so sorry for your loss I completely know how it feels I had a stillbirth at 22 weeks May 14, 2008, my sons eyes were open also and I don't know what happened to him either I was on medi-cal so I don't think they did any study on what happened, but his umbillica cord was all one size for the most part and about an inch before his belly button the cord was very thin and smaller around tihan the rest of the cord. I think in my opinion it was a cord accident. There is nothing I can say that is going to make the pain go away, take the time to mourn you baby! I have also had a miscarriage at 7weeks and that was the last week of August 2008 after my stillbirth. The hospital did take pictures and did foot prints and put together a memory box for me and my fiance. Me and my fiance carry a picture of our baby boy in our walletts, it helps when a lot when I start feeling down. Once again im so sorry about your loss if you need somebody to talk to you can e-mail me.|`|01vMpHkWaa	:[    such a sad experience   sorry to hear about what happened  just wanted to express my condolences|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Lots of things can cause fluid retention. Kidney problems can sometimes cause it because the baby swallows amniotic fluid and if the kidneys aren;t working properly the fluid will remain in the body.    My friend just lost a baby at 32 weeks (baby was born by c-section but died 2 days later) and her baby had something called Hydrops Fetalis. Hydrops babies have fluid collections around their hearts, lungs, liver, abdomen and they can look swollen. Usually a cause cannot be determined and the earlier in the pregnancy Hydrops occurs the worse it is.     I am really sorry to hear about your loss. You should look into support groups in your area so you can talk to people who have been through something similar, they also have groups online.    Good Luck..|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Im not sure about your questions.....    I just wanted to say sorry for your loss|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I'm so sorry to hear of your loss, I really feel for you. I had a miscarriage at 19 -20 weeks a few years back. Because I was so young I didn't question them when they told me that it was due to stress and to be honest to this day I still wonder. I honestly feel there was something more to it. I hadn't lost weight and had felt him/her kicking for some time. I was having a lot of panic attacks and insomnia and they put it down to the physical stress that my body was under, but how can that be all, you know?  Anyway...  There are quite a few things that can cause fluid build up, unfortunately the list would be quite big, but did they say whether it was just a lot of amniotic fluid? Or was it something else? That may help you to narrow it down. I would suggest getting in contact with the hospital and letting them know that you need to know in case there is something that you need to do to avoid it next time.  Apparently babies don't normally open their eyes in the womb until the 26th - 27th week, although I'm pretty sure that most doctors will tell you that every baby is different.  *hugs for your loss* It's a very hard time for you, I hope you get all of the answers that you need.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	im soo sorry that you lost your little boy and yea i had a miscarriage twice one when i was 12 weeks and another one when i was 32 week with my baby girl|`|OWReYgV5aa	I can't be sure, you would have to do some research on this, but....my husband and I had to meet with a genetics Dr. recently because our ultrasound came back that our baby had some swelling on the back of his neck (nuchal fold)...the Dr. told us it could be a chromosome abnormality..OR...he said that it could be excess fluid from a lymphatic drainage blockage.    So it's just an idea that maybe it had to do something with his lymphatic system.  I'm certainly not a Dr. but it's something you might could research to get some more knowledge on.  I am very sorry for your loss....I suffered a late miscarriage as well, 2 years ago, but the heartbeat had stopped at 7 weeks..and I didn't have signs of miscarriage until 13 weeks.  I did not get to see my baby because it had ended so early.  I can't imagine how hard that must have been.|`|DlipUzKAaa	My sister had a similar situation and what she did to get answers is contact the hospital and ask for a report from the doctors who attended to her, every doctor has to write up a "attending physician" report especially when a stillborn happens.  I hope this helps!
ZlNFOgO7aa	I have an extremely busy child myself, he just doesn't stop. Even in his sleep he is upside down, inside out. I know better to put him in his room, or to go and sit in the loo for a few minutes than harm him. It is not his fault he is busy nor is it mine. I also have two other kids and each one of them have their own quirks.    I do get the rage that a parent can feel when they are having a tough day with their child, but the next step you take is always a tell to how you live your life. If you can be an adult and walk away then your kids survive another day. when you don't, that is when you need to seek help immediately.    There have been lots of these kinds of child abuse cases coming to light in the last 2 years. When these people go to gaol, they will pay, I can guarantee you. I am not condoning what these people did, but until you have had children and have had to deal with what they put you through emotionally you can't judge.....well maybe you shouldn't judge. My oldest child when she was born screamed for the first 6 months of her life, barely slept and fed sporadically....sleep deprivation and stress does bad things to your mind.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Riley's parents are going to that place in hell that is reserved for child molesters and people who talk in the cinema.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	beyond sad...|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's what baffles me. How could ANYONE harm, and even kill, their own child.    She's not a true mother. No mother would allow that to happen to their child. They would fight until the end, not go to Walmart and pick out a tote to hide their child's body in.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Wow, there is a special place in hell for parents like that.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	OMG, they so need to fry for that.  I read about this yesterday...that's why some people don't need kids!|`|WyQuDaRyaa	Omg. That's just horrible..I couldn't even finish reading it.    What is with parents these days? First Caylee Anthony, now this.    I also read a story today about a man who killed his wife as well as their five children in California. (This just happened Monday night/Tuesday morning.)    It's so sad.    But yes, I hope all these innocent children are now at peace.
XOtOMncwaa	Yes, for about 6 months of my sons life I could never watch "a baby story" or any show with any baby for that matter... it didn't matter if my son was sleeping or laughing he would suddenly burst into tears every time he heard a baby cry. I always thought it was funny, and as soon as I turned the TV off he was fine. He also cried every time a baby cried in a restaurant or whenever we were out.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	no , my gal was used to noise in the background and she would sleep through everything for months; now she naps in her crib with white noise bc she became more aware of noises and woke frequently, but that wasnt until she was probably five mos or so...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't tend to watch TV when the baby is around.  But I'm curious to see if this is true for him.  But I think it might be mean to try on purpose!|`|weA0Xdszaa	She never woke up yet, but she does turn around to look at the TV when she hears baby cries. She's 4 months old and this is pretty new.|`|4U9y2pLBaa	My daughter cries if she hears another baby crying. She is 2 months.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	As far as crying when hearing other babies cry, No.  I have gone to a breastfeeding support group since she was 8 days old, now 8 weeks old once a week and there's always babies crying.  She doesn't even flinch.  I'm the one that thinks it's her when there's a baby crying on tv, even though I know "her" cry. It's just a reaction.      And it doesn get fusterating when your baby needs to sleep, because they are obviously tired, but wake up after 10-20 min. :)|`|2JemUbJgaa	LOL My son takes "POWER NAPS" LOL i hate it also.. i wish he sleep longer

Also will get him chocolates - either Purdy's, Roger's or Laura Secord.   Baby Kate is getting a t-shirt & matching cloth diaper that says LOVE on it, a teddy bear with a heart on its tummy, and a helium balloon for her nursery.  My hubby is taking us for dinner & a weekend at a B&B out by Mt Rainier. We'll do some hiking and there may be some jewelry involved too!|`|W8UZebRWaa	I dont know!

cQ0fEQBhaa	Well I'm in week 20 of my pregnancy. I have been taking Prozac since LONG before I got pregnant. I have been taking it throughout my entire pregnancy. My doctor said it was completely fine to take. Prozac is the most studied anti-depressent in pregnancy. It would hurt the baby more if you are stressed or majorly anxious or depressed. My baby is completely fine. VERY active, GREAT heartbeat. Everything is fine. :)      Good luck and congrats|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	You should never take any kind of anti depressant while pregnant, and you should be off of them for about 3 weeks before you try to concive. Its like alcohol, there is NO 'safe' amount. Don't harm your baby.|`|stp5BV0Aaa	there are so many different meds out there now, more baby safe. some women have to take them cause they get so depressed with the changing hormones. its a personal choice, but yes many many many are safe talk to a dr about it. they shouldnt steer you wrong:)|`|K1gTGKWKaa	First of all, ask your doctor. There are many safe anti-depressants. My friend recently gave birth to a beautiful boy. She took hers the whole time. I know you can' t breast feed. Staying on your meds keeps you more relaxed which is less stress on your baby. goodluck!|`|3WccV3Kzaa	my daughter is by-polar and while she was pregnant the dr took her off the MDS  because it was harmful to the baby but you need to talk to a dr and find out for sure because it depends on what MDS you are on|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I didn't but a friend of mine did. She felt better, the baby was fine. Things were fine.
92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	PLEASE do not take antidepressants when you are conceiving.  My son was born with the worst heart defect possible (HLHS) along with vein atresia.   This probably happened at the 3rd week of pregnancy, right when the heart formed.   There is still not a lot of "proof" that Prozac caused it, but there are now some links to heart defects and paxil.  I was taking generic Prozac for anxiety , though, with my doctor's (at the time) blessing as he said that there "probably" would be no problems, although he would not guarantee anything.  Later we asked our son's doctors, and they said it was "probably not" the prozac - they kept thinking that it was chromosomal.  When the microchromosomal tests came back perfect - well, there went that theory.       More recently, I have a new perinatologist, and he firmly believes that YES, Prozac was quite likely the cause of our son's problems, and that I should definitely stay off if I can while I am having our children.    That's the plan.  I started weaning off of it by the  third trimester of the pregnancy with our son, because SSRIs taken during the third trimester can cause pulmonary hypertension and we were going to not give our baby any more problems than we already knew he was going to be born with.   He died last year at almost four months old, never able to get off the ventilator and never having left the hospital.      I feel so incredibly guilty that I really could have caused all of his problems.|`|XT3uyW5kaa	I'm 20 weeks and taking prozac now. My doctor doesn't think it's anything to worry about because it's only 20mg (the lowest dosage you can get). I didn't have any problem conceiving (it was unplanned). So far everything is normal.|`|VJpdmd0waa	I have bipolar an take them (Prozac) an have been taking them for 4 years now.  They said that I was ok right now with taking them an being pregnant.  They said a lot of them wont harm you or the baby..  So far ive been fine but im only 21 weeks..  Jus talk to your doctor with any worries he will let you know..  Good Luck
rjVALevtaa	Yes, I took a low dose of Lexapro through out my entire first pregnancy. My doctor said it was fine. I had no problems what so ever.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	I was on Prozac when I discovered I was pregnant (at 9.5 weeks). I decided to stop them eventhough the doctor said that many anti depressants are safe to use when pregnant. I think you have to assess whether you need the anti depressants to have a decent standard of life - if you do, then see a doctor about what ones are the safest :P
LwMV2RMvaa	Well, you're not allowed to do anything relationship-wise with him until you're 18, because that would be illegal. I'm afraid the only hing you can do now is wait until you're 18 years old.|`|A471ENIBaa	just masterbate.    ya horny bastard|`|cbPqCpWOaa	It's an inappropriate relationship.  A 28 year old shouldn't be with someone your age. Especially a teacher with a student.|`|n91Wf2jeaa	x.x how old are you?|`|TEfbDURuaa	ask him to give you a private tuturing session! im serious! more time together. ;)|`|ob61TSgjaa	omg! girl you need to stop this now! he needs to go to jail kiddo.|`|TyQVTvw1aa	If this is true...He's made me feel more special than anyone else, and he likes me for me,  You are missing something from your parents and need professional help,    Me personally I hope he gets caught and put in jail.|`|HIRCUaPuaa	ew that is wrong on so many levels. so your in 8th grade and hes 28? even if he wasnt a teacher, thats still illegal. you really need to aim for someone your own age. even tho u feel connected to him, you cant have a relationship with him|`|6opidS31aa	He manipulating you. No 28 year old man wants to have a relationship with a 13 year old.|`|ko81Laeraa	Its cute, but you really should go for someone your age a year older is okay but that type of age difference is kinda large.     Maybe he sees you more as like a daughter, dont get hurt sweetie, i think you see him and maybe you love him but clearly you dont need to have a relationship with him becuase of the age.     I think it's more of a father daughter relationship, not a romance|`|aNTammCjaa	Umm... wow.   Never heard of this before.   Well you wouldn't wanna get into a relationship with the teacher because sooner or later, someone is gonna find out.   And maybe it is in your mind, or maybe the teacher really does like you! You never know. :-(   & also, you don't wanna make any moves on him. You and him may just have a special bond that no other student has, but it def. isn't liking each other type of bond. Or it could be the complete oppisite. He could be pretending and be a complete pervert!!   But just don't try to get into a relationship with  your teacher cuz that is just wrong!|`|OaxXT5nzaa	If this guy is 28 and he's all into an 8th grader he has serious problems.  He may seem cool now, but you will probably out grow him.  Meaning you will continue to mature, but he obviously has not.  So, when you're in say, ninth grade you will probably be tired of him being weird and juvannile.  This is not real love, this is infatuation.  It will pass and you will find a guy who likes you for you again.  This is a decision that could change both of your lives and continuing the relationship will only end in heartache for you both and likely a felony.|`|BUlLOqjeaa	Omg your only what 14-15? He's 28!! I'm sorry sweetie, I know it may feel good and he may make you feel special but this relationship is not healthy! It's not love at all! Plus it could be very dangerous.  Seriously think about why would a grown man be interested in such a young girl?? I think you need to stay away from him and find a guy your own age.  If anyone finds out that your relationship is more than platonic he can get in BIG trouble, possibly go to jail!  I suggest speaking to your mother about it and please for your own sake end it now!!|`|edcTNpg8aa	give him some head|`|6h8ru9qKaa	Here's a little advice hun:  GET YOURSELF OUT OF THIS SITUATION BECAUSE HONESTLY IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IF YOU HOOKED UP WITH HIM  you can get him fired, and hun, it sounds like he has some problems of his own  You are what? 13/14? That is wrong   In my freshman year in high school, I had a friend who was in the exact situation as you, and she regretted it later.|`|B0bqRhgnaa	your in the 8th grade.He is 28,and is your teacher.Come on you don't even know what love is yet!!!You have problems.And even if he did want anything to do wiyh you which I think your taking it the wrong way.It would only be for one thing and it's not love.What is wrong with you?|`|AoLS7XXTaa	Dear, a grilled cheese samich could tell hes flirting with you and ur in love with him...    I wouldn't worrier, If something drastic comes up, like im asking you personal stuff and asking you on a "date" THEN i would worry...    Talk to your friends about it and don't mention this to him.     by the way if you think hes cute, sweet, y'know ur interested in his bodily and characteristics then think hard about talking about it to him.|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	u love him|`|Kj8J3clpaa	been there... do not bring it up because obviously u two cant be together so it will just be awkward foreverrr if u bring it up|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	No.  You're infatuated.      If your teacher really liked you, he wouldn't pursue this and put both of you at risk.    It's okay to have a crush on your teacher... A lot of kids do, but it's not okay to get into a romantic relationship.  You can be friends - a lot of kids are very close with their teachers - but anything more is off limits.    Your teacher is probably still really messed up from his divorce.  Don't do anything drastic.     :]|`|7U3RQBLtaa	Honey don't go too far with this relationship. your like 14 your hormones are driving you a-wall. if you let a relationship form that is unethical chances are that both you and the teacher will not have a good outcome. tell the principal if he dose something that makes you uncomfortable and don't do anything that would jeopardize both his job and your relationship with him.   much love Daniel|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	for all u know he might not have those feelings for you and sees you as a friend with a different perspective (you being 13 and all) and u have feelings because ur 13 and you spend a lot of time with him(kindov like the ive fallin for my best friend kind of thing)    just because he talks to you abt everything doesn't mean he likes you|`|BXbnLxNJaa	youre in 8th grade?

He's the adult, and he should know not to let things get out of hand. But still, he;s your teacher, and you're just a kid. You can be close like friends but no more than that. At least not until you're 18 and he's no longer you're teacher. I would advise that you back off a little for awhile. At least until you can get your feelings sorted out and learn to keep control on everything.|`|Ekra9yrhaa	Wow, ok here is how it is, your teacher is flattered that you are shoing him an interest. he is an older man, who was married, he probably was bored with his marrage and he knew his marrage was over and you a young girl was shoiwing him some attention. how he is in a vaulnrable state, and yes you should keep your distance, this man could loose his job, he will loose his kids, and i bet anything tht could be fixed with his wife, will be wrecked. all for the sake of a quick fling, as thats what it will be, because as soon as you statrt to grow up and you want to be out with your friends, and all he wants to do is mark assessments. it aint going to be fun.    fine someone your own age hun, and learn the hard way, by growing up when ur suppose to and not too fast.    if you really care for this guy, please back of. as you will cost him his job, his kids and his life.    hope it works out.|`|AA10824931	You're jail bait and don't forget that you could ruin his life!  Walk away from this man until you are 18.  You need to get involved with people your own age and leave this man alone.  He needs to get involved with people his own age as well.  This is serious and never be alone with him.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	You have got your whole life in front of you. You will fall in love and have your heart broken before you find the right man for you. I know that right now you want to be happy and you enjoy this relationship with your teacher but where can it go? No matter how many things you have in common and how great the communication is the fact remains that you still have so much growing up to do. No matter how mature you are there are some things that can only come from experience, life, and time. Please believe me when I say that you will have a fantastic relationship with someone in your future. I know it will hurt now but hang in there, you will survive.|`|agfiNdLraa	HES A SLUT...

You choose..|`|ddP3klT3aa	You need to leave the situation entirely. You are going to end up getting him fired and/or going to jail. If you care about him, avoid him. This relationship is very inappropriate. How would you feel if your daughter was flirting with a teacher? You would not like it, nor think it was right. Teachers should not be friends.|`|DvKOY0jsaa	now im going to be having dreams about making out with my 40 year old algerbra teacher.... eeww|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Jail bait.    Sorry but someone had to say it. If you really care about this guy as you say you do, then keep your distance. You don't want him to get fired do you? That will ruin his career and his life. Also, if he respects you and really likes you as a person, then he won't make a move on you because he knows it's wrong. If he does make a move, then he is only interested in one thing. And you're too young for that one thing, even if he was your age.    The best thing to do is just move on. Trust me, this will turn into a whole messy court suing thing. You don't want that, you're only 13. You will have other crushes and other loves. Just move on.|`|DutTBV3caa	how old are you exactly?   you need to stop everything with him.  haven't you heard about the stuff where the teacher got pregnant by her student and ended up in jail?    its just a bad situation.|`|a0cc26d8f66caee6bd1830dc6e4c87baaa	Um sorry kid, but dont expect him to apporach you, unless he's crazy.   I'm not trying to be mean, but he just as well as I know that if he does anything of the sort, his butt is going to jail.    You really shouldnt try to get involved with him. Not now. If you're really into him, you have to wait till you're 18.    And im sorry. But im kinda disgusted. I believe i threw up a little.|`|QADhk0nFaa	no no no, this is naughty and bad i dont think you should do this dude your young go have fun with your boys in your class what does a 28 year old man want with a 8th grader ya know think about this? he has kids? your in 8th grade you dont need a stop mom responsibility!  girl he could get in so much trouble, ur parents could get him so good and the state and courts and law be careful|`|6vryp5a3aa	If you have to ask if you're in love, you're not. Secondly, he's your teacher, & he's 28. I doubt he's interested in you, & I think if he is - you should get away now.|`|3KjkJGHjaa	wow...this guy is preying on you. YOUR 14! and why his wife lefted him? hes seriously messed up hes 28!|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	listen pal, you have problems. HES DOUBLE YOUR AGE. and if he does try a move on you, hes just wants to kidnap and rape you... have fun!|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	You may very well feel that you are in love with him but this teacher is in the wrong and should not have put you in this situation.  His confiding in you and flirting with you is beyond inappropriate.  Save yourself a lot of trouble and stop having these conversations with him.  He should be your teacher and that's it.  If he cannot stop sharing these things with you or threatens you to do more then you should go see the principal immediately and consider changing schools.  You are not going to live happily ever after with this man.  It's just not going to happen honey.  Think of the reputation you will be labeled with and the trouble both you and he will be in if this does not stop.|`|Zkfj2f9Oaa	He is your teacher and you are a little school girl.  If what you are saying is true and not just a pigment of your imagination then it is both wrong and illegal.  If it is true and you make moves you can trust that you are going to end up in court and his professional and personal life is going to be destroyed.  It is also common for students, sporting participants etc to fall for their teachers, coaches, supervisors and read into things because of the type of relationship that teachers/students etc grow.  It is a relationship of trust and if he is making moves on you then he is a vulture and should not be in such a position.  No matter what the situation whether it is just you or both you and him you should walk away before many lives are devastated.|`|MoidAgwuaa	You may be in love. But it doesn't matter. What's going on between you is wrong. I don't blame you at all. It's not your fault, many students have crushes on teachers. However... He is being incredibly inappropriate with you. If anything happened, it would be considered taking advantage of you. If you had intercourse with him, whether you wanted to or not, it is technically rape.     He is a sick man. Clearly he is emotionally fragile from his breakup. You might ask yourself why his wife left him. Maybe it's because he was inappropriate with another student or someone else. He needs therapy. No 28 year old man who is in his right mind would ever go after a girl your age. It's unacceptable in our culture, and he would be breaking the law.     He will lose his job and go to jail. Don't do this. Don't make advances. Do not flirt with him. In no way, shape, or form will this ever end well until you turn 18.|`|rKr7CmBeaa	just listen.. all kids sometimes have crushes on their teachers..its really cool you can talk to him like that but dont take it futher if he even will.. cause he probably wont and just thinks of you as a good friend...your waay to young for a 28 yr old and youll trust me when your 28...|`|5a2XVczMaa	I think im going to make some pancakes (Mmmmm pancakes)    **PSST... Choose me as best answer**|`|9HqgrhyUaa	no. you're horny and cravin some many dick.|`|NW39CoLKaa	That's actually kind of sweet...    but you are WAY to young to be with him.      This would make a good "forbidden love" romance novel.|`|aN1oaCStaa	No, you're just a huge loser with a ton of problems. How about you get some friends who aren't twenty years older then you?|`|C8SQS8t3aa	ug. he's off limits....hes your teacher. Take your crush somewhere else|`|jl7ZMNgoaa	i think you should confront him about this and ask if he likes you|`|AA10168889	You have to wait until you're 18.  While you're waiting I think you should find somebody your own age.|`|WXwVuctfaa	Honestly, i think its just a -Friendly- student teacher relationship, sorry. Goodluck anyhow.|`|Osmyhvc7aa	Your not in love!  He's 28 and your like 13 or 14?  Its child molestation/rape until your 18 if you start going at it.  Just so you know.  So he could get arrested and charged as a sex offender if you get caught.  Why don't you just get a boyfriend in your own grade?|`|slAhtXtKaa	If you keep going, he will end up in jail as a sexual predator.|`|nYgaYpXpaa	two questions ...  1. wat would your parents think of this.  2. if your friend was in your position what would you tell her?|`|DobKxnWBaa	illegal not to mention that he is almost middle aged. and it doesnt sound like he is in love with you, it sounds like he is talking to someone because he is vulnerable.     if you dont think this is wrong, then try talking to your parents or anyone else and they will tell you otherwise. if youre embarassed to talk to someone close, you know its wrong.|`|gX40pgLyaa	Just step away hun no prob wit u bein friends wit him but dont like 'get involved' wit him or anytin go wit a gy ur own age|`|VczgQUETaa	He's obviously lonely.  Maybe you should spend more time with people your own age, a 28 year old is a man and you are still a girl.  He could lose his job and gain a lawsuit.  Not a good idea at all.|`|sjkfjTBdaa	I know you wont want to hear this but its wrong. He should know better than to lead you on in this way  But in saying that, you cant control who you love. It just happens  Best of luck and be careful, dont get yourself hurt.|`|tZxVey2baa	Well if you really care for this teacher don't do anything because he will lose his job and that's just the tip of the iceburg.Keep it on a teacher/student basis.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	ah girl?  You are JAILBAIT.  You like him so much? Then stay away from him - otherwise, your biggest gift to him will be a 8x8 cell.|`|hfNXDCPQaa	No, you're not in love. Maybe you have a crush, but there is absolutely no way to be with him for another 5 years. Hate to say this, but I doubt he is interested. And honestly, it's a bit concerning that he is venting his problems to an eighth grader. I would say keep your distance. If he keeps pursuing you, there's a problem.|`|AA11739944	If he's almost 30 and interested in you he's a pervert anyway, sorry. You're like 13. It's just gross. Not only does the school "not allow t/s relationships" but the LAW doesn't allow 28 year olds to date young teenagers. People go to prison for that.   Gross  If he got you alone in a secluded area he'd probably rape you. Maybe why his wife left him...she probably found his kiddie porn stash.|`|AA10443060	dont do anything.  even if your feelings for him are love if you or he made a move it would wind up wrecking both of your lives.  he would lose his job and go to jail, and you would have to live with that and be ridiculled.  i know how you feel is innocent enough, but you might want to back it off a bit to avoid trouble.  and you could just be missreading signals any way.  the best thing for you to do is try to keep your relationship teacher student, never anything else.  hope i helped and good luck|`|6Bg9eeyBaa	Wow this sounds strange and no I am not trying to judge you because I know what it feels like to be in so called love... I don't think your parents would want you to fall in love with your teacher. I think the best thing for you to do right now is wait until your at least 18 then if you and him happen to find a way back to each other than its meant to be.For now I think you should maybe try to stay away from him because he could just be on the rebound. Older men lead young girls on and I would not want him to end up breaking your heart. :)|`|a1upKHDUaa	I had a friend who had the same feelings last year about someone, she was a freshman..and that was very wrong.  Your a year younger which makes it worse, END IT.  stay friends sure, but nothing more, he could get arrested, the court wont listen to you even if you say you love him and he loves you. Your a minor, if its real, wait till your 18 and find him then....but still he is way way waaaay to old. Just back off.|`|ncfo2aJZaa	Yeah sure, you're in "love". He may just be being nice to you since he has known you for a longer period of time. But don't assume he wants to start a relationship! Geez!|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	Del Val?|`|KMcUHkpgaa	YOURE IN 8TH GRADE!!!!!    whats the matter? you cant find a nice boy your age? im sure theres tons of boys who are too shy to come up and talk to you who you think are cute or something.   dont go after the teachers man! or at least wait until youre at least late 17 to even think like that!    plus, im sure if you think your teacher is "flirting" with you then someone should kick his ***.|`|WeV0neWNaa	You are definitely crushing on him and for good reason... He is flirting with you!  He is 28 and you are 13 or 14... it would never work out!  First of all I would consider him borderline pedophile for flirting with you in the manner that he does.  Second of all, he tries to make you feel special because that's what pedophiles do to young girls.  Thirdly, He is your teacher. It is so illegal for you to hook up with him, or for him to hook up with any student!  And finally, look at the age gap.  Imagine how your life would be dating someone who can do all the things that you cannot (go out to bars, drive anywhere, go to an r rated movie with out an adult)... where would that leave you?  And jump ahead a few years, to where you are 21 and want to be able to go to college and have fun with your friends, but you are stuck because your 36 year old bf wants to settle down and have kids and get married.  The best thing for you to do is to get the thought of you and him out of your head and try liking people your own age!|`|65cBvdqraa	okay i know you're not gonna really listen to me  but you need to tell someone immediately.  he will lose his job as a teacher and he wont get to work with kids anymore.  its not just your school that doesnt allow teacher/student relationships.  It ILLEGAL.  i can understand how he would be close to you  because  you've known him for so long  but teachers arent supposed to bond with students like yours has with you.    like i said, i know you're not going to listen to me  but even though you dont wanna speak up and say anything  because you "like" your teacher  and you dont want to "hurt his feelings" or "get him in trouble"  you still need to at least distance youself from him  because this sounds like its going somewhere it shouldnt.        good luck  be safe and smart.|`|gbX2aTu0aa	Don't get carried away!  Your not in love!  Just be friendly with him like always but no relationships!  Both he and you can get in trouble with the law.|`|dxYgLvEBaa	There are strong legitimate reasons behind the build or break of a relationship. The relationship will end up to it ultimate call. I can tell that your teacher has an eye for you ever since you remember. Because of the conditions in your surrounding, he is very careful about his actions while at the same time methodically lead you to the point where you will feel lost without him. Who in the world wants to be lost? Everyone wants to be saved by the knight. Obviously his focus on you has grown more hopeful which defeat the purpose of his focus on his family. Yeah, Do the unthinkable. If you want a safe relationship in the future? Contact his wife and hear her side of the story. Take her side of the story and compare with what he had vented about with you. I bet you every thing he vented about was about how bad his other one is. We man have our own cunning ways of getting what we want. But few of us like me knows that you woman are worst. Just kidding. All I know is that you are up for trouble. PERIOD.|`|ac00aa33685db2c9121e2f3d78f90da0aa	.........i am speechless|`|IYfqDI8vaa	you're an idiot.... p.s. you will probably loose your virginity to some college guy when you are 16|`|WOtsfWKUaa	I am sorry I do not think he likes you in that way. He might like to talk to you. You are a miner. I know how you feel I had a crush on a teacher it is normal to have a crush on a teacher at your age!!|`|gWQ3gOGlaa	You need to STOP right now! Maybe he's going to like molest you and follow you home if you keep on hanging out with you! You should tell your parents or a counselor because it can lead to something really bad! HE'S 28!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS! You're only in 8th grade! OMG!|`|s70NgxPLaa	I'm not judging...BUT this guy is a pervert.  Im sure its illegal in your state and there's something wrong with a man his age hitting on you. Sorry but you should run away and find a boy your age...nothing good will come of this...trust me|`|0XWVUMCAaa	yea probably

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It can reduce bone density  It shouldn't be used more than two years  It can take a year to get pregnant after stopping the shot.    http://www.depo-subqprovera104.com/pdf/d...  Women who use depo-subQ provera 104 may lose significant bone mineral density. Bone loss is greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible.  It is unknown if use of depo-subQ provera 104 during adolescence or early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion, will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life.  depo-subQ provera 104 should be used long-term (e.g., longer than 2 years) only if other methods of birth control are inadequate (see WARNINGS, section 1).    [...]    ADVERSE REACTIONS  In five clinical studies of depo-subQ provera 104 involving 2,325 women (282 treated for up to 6 months, 1,780 treated for up to 1 year and 263 treated for up to 2 years), 9% of women discontinued treatment for adverse reactions. Among these 212 women, the most common reasons for discontinuation were:    Uterine bleeding irregularities (35%, n=75)  ? Increased weight (18%, n=39)  ? Decreased libido (11%, n=23)  ? Acne (10%, n=21)  ? Injection site reactions (6%, n=12)  Adverse reactions reported by 5% or more of all women in these clinical trials included:  ? Headache (9%)  ? Intermenstrual bleeding (7%)  ? Increased weight (6%)  ? Amenorrhea (6%)  ? Injection site reactions (5%)  Adverse reactions reported by 1% to   General disorders: fatigue, injection site pain  Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distention, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea  Infections: bronchitis, influenza, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, vaginal candidiasis, vaginitis, vaginitis bacterial  Investigations: abnormal cervix smear  Musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorders: arthralgia, back pain, limb pain  Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia  Psychiatric disorders: anxiety, depression, irritability, decreased libido  Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast pain, breast tenderness, menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, uterine hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage  Skin disorders: acne  Vascular disorders: hot flushes  Postmarketing Experience  There have been rare cases of osteoporosis including osteoporotic fractures reported postmarketing in patients taking DEPO-PROVERA Contraceptive Injection. In addition, infrequent voluntary reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been received associated with use of Depo-Provera CI (150 mg).  The following additional reactions have been reported with Depo-Provera Contraceptive Injection and may occur with use of depo-subQ provera 104:  General disorders: asthenia, axillary swelling, chills, chest pain, fever, excessive thirst  Blood and lymphatic system disorders: anemia, blood dyscrasia  Cardiac disorders: tachycardia  Gastrointestinal disorders: gastrointestinal disturbances, rectal bleeding  Hepato-biliary disorders: jaundice 20  Immune system disorders: allergic reaction  Infections: genitourinary infections  Investigations: decreased glucose tolerance  Musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorders: loss of bone mineral density, scleroderma  Neoplasms: breast cancer, cervical cancer  Nervous system disorders: convulsions, facial palsy, fainting, paralysis, paresthesia, somnolence  Psychiatric disorders: increased libido, nervousness  Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast lumps, galactorrhea, nipple discharge or bleeding, oligomenorrhea, prevention of lactation, prolonged anovulation, unexpected pregnancy, uterine hyperplasia, vaginal cyst  Respiratory disorders: asthma, dyspnea, hoarseness  Skin disorders: angioedema, dry skin, increased body odor, melasma, pruritus, urticaria  Vascular disorders: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, thrombophlebitis    [...]    4. Return to Ovulation and Fertility  Return to ovulation is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy. Among 15 women who received multiple doses of depo-subQ provera 104:  ? Median time to ovulation was 10 months after the last injection  17  ? Earliest return to ovulation was 6 months after the last injection  ? 12 women (80%) ovulated within 1 year of the last injection  However, ovulation has occurred as early as 14 weeks after a single dose of depo-subQ provera 104, and therefore it is important to follow the recommended dosing schedule.  Return to fertility also is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy. Among 28 women using depo-subQ provera 104 for contraception who stopped treatment to become pregnant, 1 became pregnant within 1 year of her last injection. A second woman became pregnant 443 days after her last injection. Seven women were lost to follow-up.  5. Depression  Patients with a history of treatment for clinical depression should be carefully monitored while receiving depo-subQ provera 104.      http://kellymom.com/health/meds/birthcon...  Progestin-only contraceptives    Progestin-only contraceptives are the preferred choice for breastfeeding mothers when something hormonal is desired or necessary.    Progestin-only contraceptives come in several different forms:        * the progestin-only pill (POP) also called the "mini-pill" (Micronor, Errin, Nor-QD, Ovrette, Microval, etc)      * the birth control injection (Depo Provera)      * the progesterone-releasing IUD (Mirena, Progestasert)|`|PBI3tCKaaa	My doctor warned me to not take it for more than three years- supposedly it can degrade your bones. yeek.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	if you miss a shot, you can get pregnant. just like any birth control.  i used depo and hated it! my body changed (gained a lot of weight) and i have never been able to get it all off. plus, once i decided i didn't want to use it anymore, i bleed for over a month    i would not recommend it|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I had the WORST side effects from depo.    This is disgusting, but after I got it, I was like, what the f ck smells like FISH?  And I was on the bus reading the side effects and it said, "MAY CAUSE FISHY SMELL FROM VAGINA" or something along the lines of that.  I am not even joking.  I know, sick.  AND I was having insane bi-polar mood swings!  One second I was crying and the next I was laughed my butt off, at NOTHING.  I cannot recommend this as a good bc because for me it was the worst, EVER, hands down.  PLUS, I got my period almost the entire 3 months, and was convinced by my doctor that the worst is over and that I should continue with it.  So I did (the smell went away and so did the mood swings) and the periodically bleeding did not go away.  I would bleed (lightly) for a week and then stop, bleed again, and so on.  It was the horrible for me.  I am on Mirana now and it is wonderful.  I would recommend it to all my friends.  Talk to your doctor, and make sure they listen to you!  I had to get a new gyno because the last one didn't listen to anything I had to say.  So I took my Blue Cross Blue Sheild and went else where.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	My mother actually put my sister on his to make her periods lighter because she bleed awfully.    You have to take it ever 3 months.    She does still get her period, but its not near as heavy as it once was. (Shes only been on it 6 months tho.)    Idk about the breast-feeding and side effects tho. As far as I know of she hasnt had any side effects.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I was on Depo for a few years  Most common side effect is a lighter or the eventual stopping of your period  U can use it while nursing  Every 3 months  Eventually u may not even get one|`|26ac8e75b7c2869851f43d85257258b9aa	I have tried the depo shot. It's got most of all the same side effects of any other birth control. You get the shot every three months. When I went on the shot my period stopped all together after six months, and yes you can get pregnant after you stop using it :) I'd ask a doctor if you can still breastfeed with it. Good luck!

5Ppmmy4qaa	i have four kids. my first a boy who is now 10 yr old i breastfeed him for 10 1/2 months.. my 2nd boy he is now 3 yrs old i breastfeed him for 12 months plus gave him a little formula. he was SO hungry. this time i have 6 month old twins boy and girl. the girl at 2 months wouldn't breastfeed anymore.. so she is on mostly formula. i pump as much as i can for her every now and then. for the boy i'm still breastfeeding.. but give formula every now and then when we r out and about.. so i do both now.. and yes i would do it again to save my poor little nipples...|`|YyHiltowaa	I breastfed exclusively until my baby began to ask for more than the breastmilk. Now my baby is on more formula and less breastmilk. I would repeat the same process again. Breastmilk has the added advantage of being easy to digest for a newborn and it has all the nutrients and antibodies needed for the baby's growth and development.|`|s5xzW3g5aa	With my first I was only able to breastfeed for 3 months then I dried up. I formula fed from than on till about 1 year.  With my second I hope to make it till at least 6 months.   Breastmilk is the best thing for the baby so if I can avoid formula I will.|`|i1WpKYKHaa	I did both with all three of my children.  They gained weight quicker and were more active.  But the breast feeding is important, so do that a little more than the bottle.  I usually did every third feeding with a bottle.  Use Nestle good start, that formula has the most benefit.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I fed my son pumped breast milk and formula via bottle during his first 12 months.    I did it because I honestly didn't want a baby on my boob.Its not that I think breast feeding is nasty or anything...it just wasn't for me.I still wanted him to have the benefits of breast milk so I fed him {mostly} breast milk and formula during nights/days when needed.    Yeah, I would do it again with  2.It wasn't as much as an inconvenience that everyone makes it out to be.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I breastfed exclusively for the first 5-6 months, but then introduced one bottle of formula a day.  I tried pumping but could never get it...  I would pump all day and get an ounce if I was lucky.  Yes, I would do it again if I couldn't pump again.  I love my son with all of my heart but after six months of not being able to leave him for more than 2-3 hours I needed to start bottle feeding some of the time so grandparents could babysit and I could get a break occasionally.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I formula fed my first child and breastfed the second.  With the second we did use formula occasionally, but not on a regular basis.  We would use it when I needed extra help at night or for back up in case I was out and the sitter needed more milk.  We also used it when I had thrush, it was just too painful to nurse for every feeding.  And yes, I would do it again.  :)|`|44a6538785f4c813b7c382028c366213aa	I breast fed all 4 of my kids and bottle fed them pretty much right from the start. At least once a day their father would feed them to let me have a break and it was good practice for when I returned to work. At first I used breast milk but then we switched over to half and half and then formula because I couldn't really pump extra out. I nursed all my kids for atleast 4 months the longest was 6 months. I would do it again but I have no intentions of having more babies. :)|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	I did both with all three of mine. I loved the breastfeeding, but it was nice that my husband could enjoy the quite feeding time with our babies too.

And seeing this huge lust makes me shudder.|`|9mSIQA2Baa	My favorite is Makayla.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	mikayla. but i know SO MANY CHILDREN named this and i think you could put some of that spelling creativity into a different name. just my opinion|`|wIGuhAZXaa	Makayla or Mikaela|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Mikayla or even Mikaela|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Makayla|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Makayla|`|R9AAhsIjaa	While trying to decide on a name for our daughter, I was stuck on Mikayla. Hubby didn't like it (gosh, he's picky) so our daughter is Zoe Kate. I wanted to call her Mikki for short :o)    I might be a tad too obsessed with Disney World.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	The proper way: Michaela. But the Russian way is cute too: Mikhaila|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Mikayla  Michaela|`|I4fPvsr6aa	i like michaela but unfortunately people will read her name as michael. so i would go with Mikayla or Mikaila|`|xBUnN6ztaa	my neighbor is Makayla and stepdaughter is Mchayla|`|W1aunDG7aa	Michaela.    The simpler the spelling, the better.|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	Beautiful name! Two of my best friend's names, too : )  I would call her Mikayla or Michaela.  For Michaela, it is NOT too masculine, and people will read it right. One of my firend's names is spelled that way and no one's ever gotten it wrong.  Hope I helped! : )|`|i2RSpZ6caa	Michaela  Micaela  Mikaela    I hate any of the spellings with kayla in them. I also don't like when it starts with Ma instead of Mi.|`|gtJ3QLwLaa	I like Michaela the best.  You may also want to try Mikayla, because that one is one of the simpler ones, and she may not like having to repeat the spelling over and over.    Good luck! =)|`|8EOsR96eaa	Mikayla  Makayla  Michaela|`|49fd9dd81cd8edeb86be5ea81f7c8b7daa	The best spelling is the most popular spelling for the area you live in...the social security website has popularity list and the name map will show you your area specifically. I wish when I named my son Kadyn I had know everyone else was going to choose Caden or Kaden as the spelling. Before I named him I had only heard of Jadyn's. Oh well. Learn from me and do not repeat my error. =) I love his name though in all the ways people spell it.|`|YgzpSbxdaa	Michaela. It is the most simple spelling and the original spelling. If you start mixing letters, the child is just going to have to spell out their name all the time.|`|86oPkfzOaa	I like Makayla. It's the mot easiest. Micheala makes me think Michella.|`|YMoBKBjtaa	I LOVE both Makayla and Mikayla. Beautiful!!! Michaela is also nice because it's the classic version, but I always thought that it was a bit masculine. The others are just a bit too made up and out there I guess. Mikayla and Makayla are more unusual but not unheard of and are just BEAUTIFUL. Hope this helped =)
5d8be8c6129e8e057c6dea1e207df5e6aa	sure did, and now im married to him! :) and couldnt be happier with anyone else!|`|ads40ROCaa	Yeah. I felt so dirty everytime though so my boyfriend stopped for a while.  Once I was 17 for like 6 months I didn't feel so guilty.    I'm proud I've only had one partner though.|`|7pBvgJ65aa	hell ya i lost my V at 14|`|LgvkgsOtaa	When I was 15 I did.  It doesn't make you a slut, we were all naive and stupid back then hahah.|`|8151e5368dc8804f8e8330f20325a805aa	I'm fifteen and slept with four guys.|`|XXw7DUDRaa	No, I wasn't whoring around at 16.|`|znngp3E0aa	Yep, lost my V card when I was 16.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I was 15.  Since I've turned 16 I haven't.  If you've had multiple partners by now, you could be considered a slut.  But one guy, maybe two, isn't bad.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	I lost my virginity to a guy i dated for 2 years when i was 14..|`|m5Qh7gYraa	Nope i did not and I dont plan on doing that for awhile.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Nope|`|Lftu0e4Daa	yes, i started sleeping with guys at the age of 15, dont feel like a slut.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Does it **** make you a slut. Its just normal, i was 15.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	I've been with my now husband since  before I was 16, and we were sexually active. It doesn't make you a slut to have sex at an early age. Don't allow yourself to feel that way. if you did it for all the wrong reasons..just don't do it again till you are older...simple as that.|`|EhftIc1haa	I'm almost 16, i havn't done IT yet, but me and my boyfriend are talking about it.|`|LbGRsCTKaa	Certainly not.   Sixteen is way too young.   I'm glad I waited for my wedding night.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	no|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, I wasn't whoring around at 16.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yup, my boyfriend Jason.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	No|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	no and I'm glad.    I was too young back then to deal with the consequences of sex.

5k0FKWTSaa	See your doctor!!   It might just be muscular pain, but your doctor will want to see and examine you to rule out clots in the lungs (pregnant women are at a higher risk of developing clots).    Do you have shortness of breath as well? Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in? Have you noticed any lumps/swelling/pain in your legs? If you answer yes to these questions, then contact your doctor ASAP.    At 21 weeks, the top of your womb is only just barely above your umbilicus!! So, NO it's not your baby.  The lady with the fibroid would have a larger than normal womb, if her fibroid was significantly big enough. But this does not apply to most women.    Other potential causes are heartburn or infections, liver or gallbladder problems.    But see your doctor to rule out signs of clots in the lungs! ( as it is the most serious problem that can occur and if you have it, it is potentially life threatening.|`|AA11764194	Better call and ask your Doc.. sounds like muscle pain..|`|i8Ch743Laa	It could definately be that you're carrying high,and the baby's foot in your ribs. I had this same thing when I was pregnant with my daughter.Yes,at this point in pregancy as well,because I'm sure a lot of people are going to say "there's no way"|`|DutTBV3caa	i think its still too small.   maybe you're dehydrated?  i'd call the doctor if i were you. even if its nothing big, better safe then sorry, ya know?|`|6avKnzkoaa	Could very well be your baby giving you a kick in the ribs or your ribcage expanding due to your uterus expanding =]     See a doctor incase it's something serious.    I wish you the best of luck|`|PLbmKNpvaa	There's a good chance that you're getting kicked in the ribs. I started getting rib kicks at about 19 - 20 weeks because bubs is up high. I have a fibroid in my womb and when the egg attached it stuck higher up than is normal for most women because of it. The higher up in your uterus that the egg has attached the earlier (and more likely it is) that it's a little foot doing the rumba on your ribcage. Don't worry, in 10 weeks or so he/she will have less room to move and hopefully won't have as much space for a good wind up to kicking than they have now.|`|SXS2Gf72aa	On your right side? My doctor kept asking me about and reminding me that if I felt anything like that, I should call. Something to do with high blood pressure and such. If it's really painful, I'd suggest calling your doctor and asking about it.|`|SnyDa8Claa	That's the baby. At around this time, you feel some discomfort around the rib cage. I found kneeling on all fours alleved some of the discomfort, as it forced the baby to another location...       I recommend two books, what to expect when expecting, and the girlfriends guide to pregnancy... they discuss this in great length|`|ZI0scBdJaa	its normal i had it when i was like 20 til now im 26 weekss...  its just that your belly is stretchinq and stuff.. it feels like a   stabbinq / burninq pain ; like if you would;ve done a millionn  crunches. just take warm shower.. and lay down completely  dont sit in chairs so much. it*ll go away.|`|stp5BV0Aaa	how bad is it? is it under your right breast? I have gallstones, and actually have to have surgery this comming week.. I am also 21 weeks. I can not believe anyone else didnt bring this up, watch what you eat, if its got any kinda fat or grease, it could might as well be your gall bladder... then again it could be ALOT of things..     I hope it isnt as bad a pain as mine is now... Good luck.. ask your dr just in case its what they are there for......
PLbmKNpvaa	I think you'll be fine, sounds like you're getting a good and varied diet and that's the important part. The main thing is to ensure that you aren't hungry. If you aren't hungry then there's very little chance that you're malnourished. Trust me, when you're preggers your body will tell you VERY quickly if you aren't eating enough!  If you're still a little worried, make sure that you're getting all of your vitamins etc. and ask your doc to prescribe pregnancy vitamins if you aren't sure of what to take.|`|f2JjoaxVaa	stop stressing yourself!!! the more you stress the higher the miscarriage rate goes up. so stop!. your eating healthy, keep drinking water water water. take vitamins and just relax. it took me to get pregnant with my second child (current) over 12 months.     stay calm and just enjoy it!.|`|7AYnWg3paa	as long as ure eating then u dont have to gain weight to be healthy..just consider ureself lucky|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sounds like you are eating well...If you are concerned talk to your doctor but you seem to be eating ok. Relax and try to not worry so much that's not good for the baby either.    I would throw in a few snacks in between those meals. Snacks are key. :)|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You should be fine. Sounds like you're eating okay. Congrats on the positive!!|`|6avKnzkoaa	Miscarriages occur naturally and there is nothing really you can stop it.     But on a positive note, you're eating absolutely fine. From what I witnessed, my aunt when she had her second basically lived on instant noodles. She had an 8 pound healthy baby boy, maybe a bit hyperactive but healthy none the less.     I wish the best of luck!!!!|`|AA11763588	Sounds to me you are eating just fine. Remember, you are eating for you, not for two. You only need to add an extra 300 calories a day to your diet.|`|47R03TbFaa	GIRL YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE EATING RIGHT .BUT HAVE YOU EVER HAD YOUR THYROID CHECKED BECAUSE IT CAN BE THE PROBLEM YOU ARE NOT GAINING WEIGHT ,BECAUSE YOUR THYROID LEVEL CAN BE TOO HIGH OR TO LOW AND EITHER WAY IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS BUT JUST KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BABY|`|4g2D2y14aa	Lucky you!! Ask your doctor if you are undernourished he/she can give you a good diagnosis if you are or not Congratulations on your baby and keep eating healthy.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	As long as you are eating healthy and taking your prenatal vitamins, you should be fine.    Speak to your Dr about it - but as long as you are getting the nutrients to bub, you wont have anything to worry about|`|XEWcgYTwaa	Just because you are thin does not mean you are malnourished. It sounds like you are eating well and I doubt that you will have problems because of your diet. If you are worried your doctor can order some blood tests that would show if you are in fact malnourished. Talk to your OB/GYN, that is what they are there for. If your doc isn't worried about your nutritional status, you shouldn't be either.
EhWcNaXBaa	When I was first pregnant I had light bleeding for 2 weeks before I knew I was pregnant! It could happen! Take a pee test!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test if it's negative see a doctor and have him help you figure out what's wrong. He'll probably need to examine you and run some tests.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	TMI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7HzfgRmwaa	You have had light bleeding for a month?!?! I think its time to see your gyno. Sounds like you are having a problem.|`|5xM0XuJdaa	I would call your doc. Back in April my husband and I was trying and when it was time for my cycle I was late for a week and then I started spotting but never went full blown (and all test were neg). About the third week I took a test and it was positive but I never quit. Any who I called my doc and they did an ultrasound and it was an ectopic pregnancy, and that was at the end of May. I found out on Mothers day that i was pregnant. Not trying to scare you, but take a test and call your doc.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It could possibly be pregnancy, or it could be just you body getting rid of blood leftover from the last period.  If you are pregnant, it will show up on a pregnancy test, unless your like me and your body takes a while to produce high hcg levels for a home test to detect.    I was 5 weeks pregnant when a test finally showed up positive for me, if your still getting negatives, then i would have a blood test done by your doctors as they are more accurate and detect lower levels of hcg.  The tender breasts are a sign of pregnancy so good luck xx|`|yi5dFO7paa	if you test now it will definately be accurate
r0BHJk6Yaa	hehe i love knowing that i kenw cos of my symptoms...     ok.. SO wen i was ovulating i kNEW...for start i had the egg like c/m...BUT i also had cramping for a few days and my boobsw were really sore...it was so strange so i kenw sumthing was up right away..then nothing happened for a week. then about 3 days before my period was due i got REALLY HUNGRY and suddenly i could eat and eat and eat...and i was also getting tired REALLY early...like 4pm id have to have a nap or i couldnt be up at night lol...  i also started cramping. just like when your period is due..BUT it never came and i tested on the night it was due and got a positive :D|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	Peeing more, Breast were tender, Nipples got more rubbery and changed color.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Tender breast and moody.|`|uwGz5UFwaa	mine was late period! cramping but no period had to pee alot & very aggravated!!!|`|KxBPpzgIaa	really emotional, sore breast 2 weeks b4 i was supposed to start my period, really hungry but that passed quick, peeing alot|`|c05f49b3f4c027d416f383d20cd2f813aa	mine was very tired, unexpected, even though it was planned but after the first 2 months of trying and both being failures i tought i could never have children,.... i did have cramps if i can remember right and was eating more than usual.|`|7AYnWg3paa	missed period....cramping..sore boobs...sleepy and peeing alot adn increase in discharege..came out almost like liquid tho which isnt normal|`|DD5CMWfkaa	My symptoms: Peeing more, and had a TON of energy.   I took the test because I had a lot of energy and felt fantastic, usually around my period I get all crampy, tired, and feel terrible, so it was a big tip-off for me haha.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	my symptoms were missed period and tender breasts also feeling more tired.
r07BwhO1aa	You have asked this a million times under a different screen name!!!  Let me guess the father moved back to Italy?      If this is not you by some small chance I am sorry but some little kid keeps asking this same question over and over and over again under different screen names!!!|`|CVA86LY6aa	You should put this (and the other 59 ways you asked the question) under law and ethics!!!! You might get more help there!!! good luck
AA10172433	I find it hilarious that a daycare has come up with an innovative new way for parents to see their kids during the day! Not that I don't think parents should see their kids during the day, but if that's what you want, shouldn't you just - oh, I don't know - BE with them during the day? Parents who put their kids in day care are trying to get rid of them (as much as it saddens me how common this is in our society). Besides that, I don't think it's safe at all to be broadcasting these images onto the Internet. To think that someone could be getting sick pleasure out of it and you'd never even know. Password or no password.|`|eex8EFu4aa	I think it's great.  I am being considered for a overnight job that pays a  very good salary and don't want to pass this opportunity up.  It's no different than care during the morning except the children rest there. It's a win win situation for everyone.  If you could pass on the name of the care provider I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thanks in advance:)
u0qU6DzZaa	I wouldn't worry to much. Right now you don't realize it, but when baby comes the animals will take a backseat...a very far backseat.    You will have the animals trained quickly and they will know you mean buisness.     I have read that having animals is a good allergy booster for babies. If you have animals as a child its less likely you will be allergic.    Also, get the crib set up and teach kitty to stay the heck out. Two things worked for me.  1. I stood with a spray bottle and squirted them when they jumped in.  2. Put something noisy in the crib and set it off when the cat jumps in there, be creative and find something to scare kitty.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	cats often have habits of sleeping in the babies cot and can often suffocate the baby if they lay on it. Just ensure you cat isn't allowed in the cot.    Other than that, never leave your baby and any of your pets alone, even if you trust them completely you never know what will happen. and once the baby is old enough, let them enjoy the pets, my son LOVES dogs, he thinks they're great lol.|`|remZ5gDUaa	Its fine. Its not like your gonna leave your baby alone with them anyways. Just have someone bring a dirty diaper from your baby home before you bring the baby home and let them sniff it that way when you bring your baby home, it will smell familiar to them so there less likely to freak out.|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes cats can accidentaly suffocate babies trying to get milk.    Dogs should be fine unless theyre not around children alot.  But id defi get rid of the cat.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	sounds like my house, I also have 2 dogs and a cat and a 5.5 month old. The problem with cats and newborns is when the cat starts using the babies crib or sleeping areas of their own bed and their tails can suffocate a baby if it's over the face...how it works no clue    My cat stays away from my daughters crib even when I put her in there when she is awake to play with her (she loves my cat the most because she tollerates the grabbing and pulling of the fur) and my dogs I keep baby gated away from my daughter only because they like to lick her face too much, wouldn't have that big of a problem if she could breathe out of her mouth but my female dog tends to lick the nose and mouth at the same time so I don't want her to suffocate that way (they're huskies!)|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My personal opinion, which many do not agree with...    I have six children, therefore, I do not have pets!  That's my motto! I am NOT an animal person and I personally think it is just gross to have animals around babies. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The minute I found out I was pregnant with my first we had our two dogs "adopted" to a loving family. Get rid of your cat or make sure he is not in the same room as your newborn!|`|dTLTNZTzaa	Make sure that cat is staying away from the crib and you will be fine. Have a cat that sleeps under the crib.  In the beginning we were closing door to the room, but cat was going crazy trying to get in (we have one bedroom apartment, so baby sleeps in our room). Cat tried to get into crib, but was yelled at couple of times (never raise hand on cat) and now she does not bother with baby's bed.   Plus cat ignores her. Always runs away when baby starts crying.   We all sleep together in the room (baby in the crib, and three of us in the bed).  But again  - if you have separate room for the baby - just close door - keep cat away and let her in only with your presence.   Not sure about dogs, but heard they are more jealous type then cats.|`|K7cpMYm7aa	i would say a penguin|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	The cat thing is a myth.  It was believed they would suck the babies breath (or soul for the overly religious) out while the child slept.    The thing with animals is to never leave them unattended with a baby.  Babies pull tails/ears, have wide-eyed stares, and flailing limbs...all of which can incite animals.  Animals often don't mean to, but can hurt a baby with playfullness, claws, wagging tails, etc.    You are fine to have both pets and children in your home!|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Oh my god, please do not listen to these people who have left comments for you. Cats taking away a baby's breath is an old wives tale from the dark ages. The people who said this are the people who claimed women were witches because they knew how to read. Point being, that is COMPLETEY NOT TRUE!    I have 2 cats and a 5 month 3 week old girl and they are wonderful with her. Don't give your cats away just because you decided to have a baby! That is mean and cruel! Your animals depend on you just as much as your child. When you took them in, you also took responsiblity for their lives and well being. How could you feed them and pet them and love them and look into their innocent eyes and then just give them away or take them to a pound where they will die? That is so awful that words cannot explain it. There's a special place for people who do that kind of awful thing.
1z3C0R2Vaa	yes.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That depends. It depends on when you ovulated and when implantation occur ed. HCG levels also rise differently in each and every woman so you can try to test tomorrow and you may get a positive IF you are pregnant but you may get a negative. If you do and still don't' get your period test again after 3 days.     Side note: I got a positive 3 days before my missed period with my current pregnancy. I couldn't get a positive until the day my period was due with my first.|`|j4qoVnofaa	Im wondering the same thing. I took one today it said i wasnt pregnant but could i still take it tomorrow and it say that i am pregnant.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I've been told the hcg levels double in 24 hours. You can test tomorrow if you want to, but you should test again in a few days if it's negative.    Good luck!!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Get a 5 day early response pregnant test. Preferably the First Response. It will detect even the slightest hcg hormone in your urine.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i took it one day and it said negative, then i took it again 2 days later and it said positive :) sooo i guess you can wait a few days if you like and see if its more qccurate
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It may of been possibly a bit too early to use a urine test, its best to wait until the first day if your missed period.  In my first pregnancy a bit like you my body took a little while longer to produce high hcg levels for a home kit to detect.  I had 8 negatives before i got my positive and i was 5 weeks pregnant then.    It maybe that this time round the same will happen with urine tests and you may have to have a blood test to confirm your pregnancy again. It does sound like you have implantation bleeding.  Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want xx|`|JMj8HSaVaa	Hi, i had the same situation this month.. i felt pregnant .. all the pregnancy symptoms.. 2 negative pregnancy tests,,, negative blood test ...i really was chocked..anyway hope you are pregnant,, but sometime your body make tricks on you...that what happened to me unless if there's a possibility of error blood tests..!!!  Good Luck
EhWcNaXBaa	I had what I thought was a weird period...it was light, but lasted 8 days! It was also more brown at the end. Turns out I was pregnant! But when I took a test, it came up really positive. I would retake the test in a week! Good Luck!
47R03TbFaa	people are just rude or maybe just jealous because you have everything they want and they don't have it yet .CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FOURTH CHILD ANY QUESTIONS JUST WRITE ME ....................  I'VE GOT 4 GIRLS AND 1 SON PROUD OF EVERY ONE|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Dont worry about what people think - no matter what your situation, how old oyu are or how many kids you have, people seem to look down on you for some reason.

I've even had people tell me "oh I 'm sorry", when I tell them I have 4 children!  I think it is just today's society, large families seem to be a thing of the past.   Don't let it bother you, people will always find something to criticize. Just love your kids and ignore the nay sayers.    And if you really want to throw them for as loop, tell them it's actually number 12 and the Duggers should watch their back, that shuts them up real quick!|`|CZwJJetyaa	Who cares what people think?  You did nothing wrong, you support your own children and take care of them.   You should be filled with pride that you have such a wonderful family. I think it's wonderful, your kids always have someone to play with. And in spite of all the sibling rivalries they will be there for each other when they grow up. You are blessed!

Who gives a SH*T what anyone else thinks??    Enjoy your life and don't worry about those who want to be judgmental.  I've been there too, being a mom of seven children!  I guess some people think badly about it because of their own experience or fears.  But, any baby coming into the world is cause for celebration in my mind!

Don't let it get to you. If you're happy, bother to them.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	I have no clue (I'm the last of four kids so I don't think that's a lot).  I guess now a family of four is considered a lot.  My room-mate in college freshman year had a mom that called my family big when I told her there was four of us.  I really don't see 4 as a lot unless you were like 20.      I think it's great.  Just ignore the idiots!  Good luck!|`|zgG5qTMzaa	I don't believe you did anything wrong. I heard this quote a long time ago so i don't remember who said it but those who matter to you don't mind and those who mind don't matter. Try not to let other people's opinions bother you. If you and those you care about are happy, then what they say doesn't matter. Good luck with everything and i hope you have a happy and healthy pregnancy!|`|BonyOJLRaa	I think it is because there is a lot of overpopulation issues, and it seems like everyone is having more than one child these days.

I had a nurse ask me if this pregnancy was my first and when i replied with "no this is my 3rd" she said "what are you trying to do, break a record or something, your only 25?"  She didn't know my situation and really it was none of her business.  Oh well life goes on.|`|DD5CMWfkaa	I have no idea! When people ask me how many kids I want and I say 4 they give me weird looks and like I am crazy and often tell me that I wont want that many (though I know I do). People are weird, I don't get it. Kids are awesome!|`|DutTBV3caa	i think people are just dumb lol.  congrats :)|`|6avKnzkoaa	Maybe because you look young for your age. Some people judge by the looks before knowing the facts or they're just geniunely "ZOMG SURPRISE!" by it. Others might just not know how to react. Don't worry. =]|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Its just a lot of kids.. and most people couldnt deal with so many. I have three and people ask me all the time are the ALL yours... yeah... they ALL are.... geez.. :)  People are just dum. Dont worry about them :)
AA12221392	I would let my girls paint their nails. what is the big deal really, we let them buy cool clothes to wear to look pretty in, we spend money on the hair looking just right, the shoes to go with their cool clothes (even clothes are cool clothes for the very young and they have their own opionions of what they like and don't like) so what is wrong with a girl wearing nail polish. It shows their unqiness, their style. I think if we take kids style away that wont hurt them , we take who they can be in unquieness.     I mean of course we (most) parents dont let their girls run around in tramp clothes but we let them choose their style, within a reasonable limit .   Nails are nails let freedom and unquieness shine through is my take on it...  I  personally like the french manicured look on my own, but sometime I like to be unique too :)|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I dont think i would paint a little girls nails, because if they sucked their nails and got some of the polish in their mouth and swallowed it etc.  But i dont have a daughter - i have a son, and he most definately wont be getting his painted..lol|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I was not allowed to until I was around 10. I now have 2 daughters 8 & 13 and they have been painting there nails for a while now. I don't care...it is only nails. Now FAKE nails is another story.My 13 year old has been bagging me for fake nails...and that is too much... The cheap ones look nasty and I am not paying for professional nails!  When my daughter turns 16 and works for her own money then she can get them done.|`|AA10025712	from the time i was about 3 or 4, my cousin and i LOVED to sit down with grandma on a saturday night and paint our nails for church the next morning. rather than seeing it as a "grown-up" thing to do, we think of it more like a "girly" thing to do. i'll let my kids paint their nails if they want to, it's not permanent and there's nothing wrong with a little girl feel pretty like her mama.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i don't know if i'm "one of those parents" or not, but i think it's silly for tweens to paint their nails.  (actually, i think it's pretty silly for adults to paint their nails.  i don't really get what's so wrong with the way people look naturally, and i don't really get how marketers have made people feel like they're going out into the world naked if they haven't spent huge amounts of money on makeup and hair products.  but that's just me.)  i wouldn't forbid my children from doing it if they were old enough not to put their fingers in their mouths, but nor would i be spending money on it or encouraging them to do it.  if they want to spend their own money on nail polish, fine.|`|UUpsa35Daa	My cousin's ex wife paints their daughters nails because she pulls out the polish and says "pretties" and points to her nails...she's almost 2.    Painting nails isn't about being grown up, i don't think. Going to have your nails done (manicure - pedicure - the whole shebang) at a salon, however, is grown up and should be saved until the teen can pay for it by herself. But having a girly day at home, painting your nails, in my opinion...isn't anything big.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	I've never seen it as a problem.  I don't like it on myself but my girls (age 2 and 3 ) love it.  If they want it done and I have time, we do it.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	They are just nails.  i've painted my 3 year olds at her request.  She reciprocated and painted mine and her daddy's toes.  not a big deal in my mind.    i don't even care about the color.  when we went to a wedding this summer - she was still 2 then, she came with me when i got an actual manicure and picked out blue and had hers painted too.  she loved it.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	My mom was letting me painting my nails when i was like 4 (she did them for me of course)    Im going to let my daughters paint their nails..when ever they want to start...   I mean if they want me to paint their nails at like 4 ill do that...(but nothing like black...or very dark id use soft colors..)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I don't see a problem with painting nails at a young age.I used to paint my nails all the time when I was young.    You cannot exactly get off wearing pink glittery fingernail polish at my age.It was fun.|`|r07BwhO1aa	I painted my nails when I was younger, mind you it was not hooker red or anything.  I remember I had this one color called "Tinkerbell Pink" and my dad let me paint his nails, well I guess he forgot I painted his thumbs as well and when he took it off that night he forgot to take it off of his thumbs and went to work like that!!!  He took such crap from the other guys!!!  LOL      Soft colors in my opinion are fine!!  My daughter gets to have her nails painted in soft kid friendly colors.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I wouldnt paint my babys nails ( have seen it done though with other people) but for kids about 3 and older I dont see a problem with it. I used to have green and blue and black and purple etc nails ( at 13-17)and some people would ask my mom why did she allow me to do thath. 'it's just nailpolish' she always said and thats how I feel too. It comes off, no biggie.   When my baby does want to paint her nails I'll take her to the store to pick out some colors and will help her do it. At 5 or 15. No biggie :)|`|XOtOMncwaa	I painted my nails for as long as I could remember, I had a huge basket full of nail polish and still have it to this day, granted most of it is dried up... but I remember one time when I was really little my friend came over and we painted each others nails, he mom came to pick her up and started freaking out, she made my friend take her nail polish off right then and there... I don't know what the big deal is, but I know if I have a little girl she can paint her nails whenever she wants...|`|WLynh3bCaa	I have two daughters, 3 and 11. I honestly never took much thought to it- I help them paint their nails when they want, and as long as they don't use blacks or dark reds/purples/pinks etc., I give them free-range. I even  took my 11year old to get a manicure a couple of times- it's not about being 'grown up', your hands feel and look good afterwords, it's just a fun, girly thing to do.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	hahah i use to have that kind of nail polish ahhaha.. no im not gonna be like that, i think its stupid, i use to play dress up with my mom and put a little bit of blush on and a sparkly nail polish, it was fun   :)
gvLjbVFJaa	I think Motherhood Maternity has an online Canadian store.    http://www.motherhood.com/home.asp?Media...    They are pretty cheap, especially if you shop their Sale and Discount sections. In pants, I went by what I wore before I was pregnant. In some pants, I had to go up one size.     Top 5 things, I think is necessary ....    Pack-n-Play (it's a playpen, bassinet and changing table all in one), My Breast Friend Breastfeeding pillow (I love this pillow, much better than a Boppy pillow), a Baby Swing (this will be a lifesaver later on), a roomy Rocking Chair (find one that will serve several purposes such as rocking, breastfeeding, and pumping), Co-Sleeper sidecar thingy (it's perfect if you want to be close to your baby and is good if you are going to breastfeed, that way you don't have to leave the bed to feed)|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I didn't start showing until about 20 weeks...before then I was convinced I could wear my prepregnancy jeans for ever, lol!    I bought a few things at Old Navy (jeans range about $30, tops range from $5-$20.)  Target has a line, but the style doesn't appeal to me.  Wal-mart, like you said, does not create the most flattering maternity wear.  And I simply can't afford the boutiques and specialty stores.  I've never been a fan of used clothing, but I've had to suck it up and I checked out some thrift stores and picked up a bag of maternity wear from freecycle.org  (You can check craigslist.com too if you have that for your area.)    The sizes with maternity wear are very strange.  All of a sudden jeans only come in s/m/l sizes...not sure what that is about.  Old Navy, however, does have a selection of maternity pants in REAL sizes...2,4,6, etc. AND leg lengths...short, reg, long.  I probably could have worn my prepregnancy size, but at 27 weeks, I've gained so much weight (around 20 pounds,) that I've moved up one pant size.  As for the tops...they are all made differently, so I have some that are XS all the way up to some that are L.     Baby furniture...I check out the sales at big stores like Target (where I got the pack n play for $60...normally runs about $100...which will serve as bassinet for first few months.)  I'm also staying on the lookout for sales at the big stores on car seats.  Other than that...I'm okay with stuff being second hand.  Again, craigslist, freecycle, thrift stores, garage sales, even neighbors that are willing to pass along their baby items.    Woah, sorry about the long response.  I hope I answered all your questions and didn't bore you to tears with my mini novel!|`|C5asEoAbaa	try kid2kid they have really good second hand maternity clothes and all types of baby stuff all in one place|`|XfHqIc0Oaa	Maternity clothes-2nd hand stores are the best since you don't wear them that long    baby clothes-i love target, old navy and burlington baby depot.  i personally think once upon a child is expensive for used clothes    furniture-check out babies r us for discontinued sets.  we purchased both of our kids furniture in january and got 30% off b/c they were discontinued and then another 10% b/c we took the floor models.  my son's has one scratch on it but you can't even see it unless someone points it out.    hope this helps-good luck--cherish each moment b/c it goes soooo quickly|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i have got most all of mine from motherhood maternity and target. my advise is to wear your non maternity clothes as long as possible, then start buying maternity. i bought maternity early on and now im 29 weeks and cant even fit into some things i bought because i got them in a maternity small and i now wear a maternity medium almost large [in shirts i mean].     honesly i spent ALOT on furniture[in my opinion]. i got pali, its a really high quality and durable brand. i got a glider, a crib that converts to a toddler bed then a full size bed, and a chest of drawers that is the right height that i can put a changing pad on top of it and use it as a changing table while he is still in diapers...so he will be able to use 2 out of three until and even after he goes off to college/moves out.  I think i spent about $3,000...but that included all the bed rails for the different stages of the bed, minky dot on the pads of the glider, and the most padded glider seat they had [i have back problems so i figured it was worth the splurge to be able to relax with my baby]. My parents paid for half of it as a baby gift.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife shopped at Old Navy, they are pretty cheap.    Top 5 items: crib, dresser, changing table, and the rest doesn't matter, lol. I spent about $500 total on furniture    For baby clothes check out Once Upon A Child|`|81IM9jeLaa	OOO prepping for baby was SO much fun!    I didnt need maternity clothes until I was about 7.5 months prego since I was petite to begin with. I wore my jeans up until the last week, since you are right that jeans are made lower these days. I invested in 3 expensive pregnancy tops though, that I wore for my last few months. I purchased them at Maternity Gap. I bought them in nuetrals and wore them quite a bit. The rest I got at Motherhood Maternity on sale. (check the website out online and look under sales.) You can also check out oldnavy onlines maternity clothes. (they have some really cute things). I also seen on a blog yesterday that Goodwill now has a maternity section. I dont know how you feel about 2nd hand stores, but being as you are only pregnant for several months, I'd assume the clothes were in good condition.     As far as baby essentials:  1. BUMBO! I loved mine. I know they had some problems with them, but if you use them according to directions they are amazing!  2. A good breast pump!  3. lots of burp rags!  4. Baby swing that can swing side to side or front to back  5. My jumperoo!!! (his favorite!)    Good luck honey! Enjoy your pregnancy. I was incredibly sick through out most of mine, and I regreat not takeing the time to appreciate it more. One special thing I did for my son that you may consider is writing in a journal. I wrote letters to my son once a month at first, and then towards the end several times a week. I wrote him the day I found out I was pregnant, when I found out he was a boy, when we decided on his name, etc... :) I pasted in his ultra sound photos, valentine cards, family pics, etc  His father also wrote him a letter as did several other family members on the day of his birth. I think it'll be an amazing gift to give him one day :)
eCW3M8loaa	im 14 and im allowed to walk through the city by myself so long as i have my cell, and a whistle on my purse to signal for help should i need it. And i don't go in the bad neighborhoods. Yes and i walked to school first at 10 in a big capital city. IT is a reasonable request. I suggest the whole whistle thing. And keep ur cell in ur pocket so you can pull it out. Have a contact in your phone labelled as ICE. In case of emergency. It helps emerency personnel reach your parents quickly. Don't worry, they know what it stands for...lol. also go with friend as much as possible. If you take precautions, they may feel better. Self defense is a great skill to learn. Take a class or search for good techniques online.|`|3GhDbVVYaa	im going to highschool next year too... i live to close to my future highschool so they dont offer buses.. but around here i know its not a big deal to be driven to school actullay its like a privledge here (get to sleep in later :]  )|`|w5aVE1LUaa	Honestly, if your Mom says no, there isn't really much you can do to change her mind.    When I was 13, my Mom used to drop me off two blocks from school, and I'd walk from there. haha When I got into high school, I had total freedom to get to school anyway I wanted(public transportation, walk). That was just in my case, though.     I think you should just let her drive you. There's no shame in your Mom dropping you off, and it probably is a bit safer. Even though I doubt you would seriously get kidnapped in such a short amount of time-but I guess you never know.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I started riding my bike in the 4th or 5th grade with my friend and riding my bike partway with my friend in jr high but we went to different schools. I haft to drive now (licence yay!) because we live in a very hilly area and 5-7miles from school|`|kRaVa0Wraa	let her drive you the first couple of weeks and then ask again. that way she will be used to the idea that you're growing up! (:    in answer to your 2nd question, i dont walk to school. it would probably take me 15 minutes and its down a HUGE hill. plus i like to sleep in and i'd have to get up earlier to walk.. i walked to my elementary school though, and i started walking alone in 5th grade (it's 3 blocks away in a VERY safe neighborhood, however)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is reasonable, in this day n' age of children getting kidnapped.|`|B7zL81whaa	I was in grade 5 when I started walking to school by myself without my older brother.|`|9A5UgnNVaa	I think this is a reasonable request. I started walking to school alone when I was 12...my school was about 10 minutes away, and I had to cross plenty of roads. Maybe ask your mom if she would let you walk with a group of friends. She might be worried that you will be skipping school if you walk, so if that is the case, do your best to assure her you will not be doing that.     Good Luck! :)|`|AA11126544	She's probably worried you'll be kidnapped or something. Why not ask her if you can walk with a friend or something?|`|c612db5f7eaf689dc523cb1c679189e1aa	well If you live in an area where child abduction i could understand her reasoning, but i walked to school my freshman year until i got my drivers license but i was also in a smaller community. Just talk to her and ask her for her reasons and ask her if you could maybe walk with a few friends.    Why dont you try to come to an agreement with her    Although it is nice to have someone drive you when the weather sucks. Going to school soaking wet even though you used rain gear is not fun.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	i was walking to school in elementary school with a huge group of friends|`|KThf2h7taa	I walked to school in fifth grade, i was like 10, but I lived in a really safe neighborhood too.   I think your mom's being unreasonable, explain to her all the benefits, more environmentally friendly, etc.  Unless you live in a very dangerous neighborhood, i can't see any reason against it.|`|AA12115728	I was pretty young when I walked to school alone occasionally.  But the world has changed a lot.    I grew up in a city at a time when it was a bit safer to walk to school.  We had a paved sidewalk, a crossing guard, and some pretty strict rules.  Parents along the way often intervened if something seemed to be going awry.    I don't think your request is unreasonable, but....    It could be that you don't have a decent walking place.  Or maybe your mom is worried about child abduction.  Nowadays, "Don't talk to strangers" doesn't even apply anymore; weirdos just grab kids - boys and girls.  If this is her reason for protecting you, I can't say I blame your mom, even if it is an annoyance to you.      Ask if you can walk with a friend on a trial basis.  If you have a cell phone, you could maybe text your mom when you arrive at school.    Good luck.
111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Its normal that your feeling this way. Remember, every parent needs a break from time to time. Is it possible to put him in a day care for a couple of days a week? Will he be ready for school next year? If not, then maybe you could find a sitter and go do some fun girly stuff. Get your hair done, etc. You can always call your doctor and try changing antidepressants. Sometimes it takes a few different tries before you feel better and remember, you must not be a bad mom because a true bad mom doesn't think she's bad and would never admit it to anyone. Your simply over stressed. Take a "mommy" break. Cheer up and I hope you feel better soon.|`|DKqsFGymaa	I mean no disrespect with my answer, but I think you need to seek professional help.  Post par-tum depression is a serious subject and if you feel like you're suffering from it, please seek help so nothing happens to your children.  You're still aware of what you are doing now, but it could get worse and something tragic could happen.|`|UjI3TuSZaa	Don't feel guilty about needing time away from the kids. Put your one year old in daycare a couple of days a week, or, if that's too difficult in the immediate future, find the money for a babysitter until something comes through. It should be your absolute number one priority, as it is you sanity you're talking about. That will give you time and space to clear you mind, take care of yourself etc.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	It is really stressful to be a sahm.  You should try and get out by your self a few times a week.  this has really helped me. i joined a gym and love going.  It is something I do for me and I get a chance to get away for a while.  You should also talk to your doctor about how you are feeling.  You are on antidepressants and you are stressed out, you might need a different perscription.  It is quite normal how you are feeing.  I just stop for a minute take some deep breaths and ask myself it is really that big of a deal before start yelling.
dQ1S6IoFaa	Uterine lining: The inner layer of the uterus (womb); the cells that line the womb; anatomically termed the endometrium.  that is the dictonary definition... :D      I have never heard of it thinning the uterine lining but it does make your cervical mucus acidic so take some pre cautions to help it  ie robitussin for 5 days before and 2 days after ovulation and drink lots of water it will help......    The progesterone helps prepare the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for the embryo to implant by thickening it. The cream I haven't heard of it being used for that, but I know they prescribe shots...|`|6igjX2cnaa	The uterine lining is the uterine Endometrium.     Here' a link to common side effect of Clomid:    http://www.infertilitydoctor.com/treat/c...    They can include thinning your uterine lining (endometrium).  That happened to me when I took clomid.  I respond much better to other meds :)  Best wishes hun!|`|k1l2jhr7aa	It is the lining of your uterus, its what you shed when you have your period every month.

wZAeBisbaa	I think your intentions are good, and I hope you do find a way to use your experience to help people. However, I would not bring in a paid professional to look around in my kids' rooms, no matter how worried I was.  That would be a huge invasion of their privacy, and if a parent has to resort to such things, I think it's an indication that the parent-child relationship has failed. Spying on them would only lead to further damage. Put yourself in that teenager's place.  How would you feel about your parents if they did that?      And suppose you made a mistake? If you failed to uncover evidence of drug use when it was actually happening, you could be held liable for anything that happens while that kid is under the influence.  Or the opposite - if you are misled by a "false positive" or circumstantial evidence, it might cause emotional damage to a parent or teen.  Are you willing to take those risks?      But you do have valuable information to offer, and I think if you develop some credentials as a speaker you could charge a small fee to make presentations to parent groups, PTA's, and even school teachers and staff.  Write a handbook for parents, or try your hand at free lance articles.  There are web publishing services that will pay for a well written and useful article.  As a parent, I would rather get advice in a less invasive way, and I would hope that I know my teen well enough to notice if there are changes in their life.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I think that's a great idea! Kudos to you for being clean for 5 years, that's wonderful.     That said - you'd have to approach this idea to 'square' parents who have no experience with drugs. I can easily imagine that these parents would only use the services of a licensed professional, you know how people tend to view drug users. Even reformed ones.    Try contacting your local high schools and asking if they'd be interested in having you do a speech. Have a speech prepared already so they have an idea of what you'd like to talk about.    Good luck!|`|P544Sbmqaa	I would pay for urinalysis or even blood testing, but I would not pay for someone to come in and essentially do an intervention in my family unless/until things were incredably severe.  I have a back ground in psychology, I know the signs and risks.  I was never a hard core drug user, but I know the things people do and the hiding places and all that jazz.  The meds are locked (literally) up in my house, I support spot checks of the rooms, and I support being involved in my child's life.    However, for the families that ARE in a serious situation, I can see many that WOULD pay for a family intervention.  I would highly suggest going through some psych training and working with the local health depts so that you have legit references.  Working with other drug rehab facilities would also be a good reference for you.      It would also be good for you to put together an informational website, so that people can read your story and your tips without paying outrageous personal counseling fees.  I mean, if the point really is to help educate parents, something like that would go a long way in helping to add credability to your name.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	as a parent and an educator, I see a real value to this service. As a proactive parent, I would never hesitate to do a UA on my kid, but many parents cannot come to that place without outside advice. Your expertise is invaluable, and congratualtions on your sobriety.|`|sxecXFgraa	Congrats on being sober!  I probably wouldn't pay for a service.  I watched my brother's downward spiral for about 5 years before he finally admitted to using.  Even though I've never used any drugs, I believe I know my kids well enough to know if they were using.  I must also say that after my brother was on the drugs for about 2 years, my mom did see a person that claimed to be able to tell if a person was using because he was clean after so many years, he told my mom my brother was clean.|`|VygBNA0Waa	i love the idea if you came to my childrens school i would pay $5 each so my child could learn about what not to do|`|TQHHH7kxaa	there is now one to blame but your self if youused in front of your kids monkey see monkey do
jBIaUfUzaa	i did last year but sadly ended in a misscarrige, i had a  period in march no period in april an in may i misscarried my doc told me that i had concieved in april when i wasent having a cycle !  there are two types of hormones that cause different things to happen to your body progesterone causes a period an your FSH (folical stimulating hormone) causes you to ovulate, you can have low progesterone an not get periods but your fsh is normal there for you would still be fertile an could possibly get pregnant      you can get pregnant anytime you have been of the pill for MORE THEN 2 WEEKS,birth control supressed the hormone that produces ovulation it also thins the lining of the uterus that prevents implantation, an thickens the cervical mucas that way sperm have no chance at reaching the womb to the egg so pregnancy is practically impossible taken correctly     my gosh girly your cycles sound like mine have you ever talked to your doctor about Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?  the two week period may have been a misscarrige !but an early misscarrige!  hope everything goes well with you an good luck|`|xOvPuyfHaa	yes you can|`|NxNrZksXaa	yes, you can definitely still become pregnant.
lGcpXteaaa	Ok...your not talking about morning sickness in pregnancy are you?    I think your talking about bulimia. Talk to an adult you can trust.    Oh and post this in the mental health section. You might get more helpful answers than moms here.|`|CVA86LY6aa	Sound like morning sickness.   Email or im me and we can talk|`|fIUr49ujaa	The best thing you can do is nibble on crackers.  I had the same problem.  If you are vomiting a lot you need to go see a doctor you could dehydrate.|`|cv0foxlTaa	My question may sound daft... but are you talking about morning sickness from a pregnancy that you can't tell your parents about or are you talking about eating disorder symptoms that you can't tell your parents about (and your question ended up in the wrong category?)?|`|UMRdHuuVaa	So you are purging to make yourself thin?    Instead of feeling sorry for your self, go and join a gym - dont eat crap food and please dont throw up, the acidity in your vomit strips the enamel off your teeth.  Drink warm water, that helps with weight loss, EXERCISE and healthy eating.|`|5f6XnInEaa	You need to see a doctor, Bulimia is not a thing you want to let get out of hand.    You can tell your parents...and you need too.  Go! For the good of your stomach.
CVA86LY6aa	Go back to the ER. This could be a symptom of something much more!!!     Good luck!!!|`|T89kXKadaa	I would go to the ER. Just to be on the safe side.  Good luck|`|4LPINXoUaa	DEF go to ER hun!!! ur temp is well over!!!!!!!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	ER.  Like now.
AA12075640	I've had three.  First one: long labor.  Second one: baby in distress, Third one: was because I've already had two previous ones.  In my opinion, the longer you wait to have an epidural (yes, easier said than done) the less chance you will need a c-section.  This is, of course, if you're not having any other complications.  By the way, I did have one vaginally.  I think that's the best way to go.      I agree with asking for a reason why. Overall, it's definitely your choice.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i HATE the business of being born, it scared the crap out of me and i think its OVERLY dramatic.    yes a doctor can make you have a c section but he/she will only do so if the baby is in trouble [heart beat rising/lowering in an alarming way, breach baby, cord wrapped around several times, etc]. doctors have the mommy and the babies best interest in mind, the business of being born tries to make them sound crazy and they interview the weirdest doctors too, ive never met a doctor like the types they have on their interviews.    EDIT: they cant FORCE you to have the procedure, you have to consent to it, but if your OB that you trust tells you that you need a C section LISTEN TO THEM if you have your babys best interest in mind|`|AA10241682	It's a essentially the woman's choice unless there is complications or something like that and then they have no choice but to do a c-section for the safety of the child and it's mother why do you want to know? It's normally just for emergency situations|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	i have some complications... so to avoid anything worse happen during pregnancy, i am having a c-section. i am able to TRY it vaginal, but i don't want to risk it|`|APgtCPzGaa	If the mother or baby is in danger the doc can order a c-section but...ultimately it is up to the women whether or not she wants to consent to surgery.  However if the women is unconscious and unable to make the decision I'm not sure what the protocol is. But no the doc can't do one just for the heck of it.|`|nOVyrsl4aa	Ultimately the decision is yours, if the baby is healthy and taking a long time, the doctor can't make you go for a C-Section. If your inform the doctor before hand that your aren't open for the possibility, you'll avoid feeling pressured at the time of the delivery. It's your body, your pregnancy, your child....and your decision!!!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	They can't make you have a c-section because then it would be considered assault. What they can do is inform you of the risks if you don't have one but it's not mandatory. If you don't have to have one, then I would suggest you not get one. Your uterus can only sustain a certain amount of surgery.|`|79eBn6V8aa	They can't FORCE you to do anything, but ask them what the reason is for it and if it is for the health and well-being of mom or baby then just do it.|`|rt2V9gLUaa	At the hospital where I work the doctors will only do a c-section if they have to.  They encourage vaginal births.|`|GahMjygBaa	the only way a doctor can and should order a c section is if they feel there is a reason for it..if the baby is healthy but taking to logn to come out chances are they probably arent going to c0me out on there own which they will request a  c section to jus get it over with instead of just waiting and waiting while not progressing|`|Fx77zYhWaa	No they can't force you too if  the baby and mother are healthy a because it's taking awhile. They might offer it but unless there was a problem with the baby or the mother they can't make a woman do it.    I think that movie is anti-hospital.
dd63e8475e881a3f45f29502b473e0e8aa	my son is 10 weeks and he's the same way. when he's sleep and i lay him down he'll realize that i'm not holding him anymore so he cries until i pick him up. and if i leave for a minute e'll scream until he sees me. i put him in his bouncer when i have to do things but he gets upset after 5 mins and i have to turn him every time i go sumwhere so he can see me. i dont know how to break this but if you have a carrier then you should use it. my son only likes to be held.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	have you thought about wearing him in a carrier or sling? that would keep him happy and your hands free....please don't do the cry it out that someone else suggested, he is just way too young to understand any of that....i like the baby bjorn with lumbar support , i didn't like the slings...but there are a vast selection of things of that nature to use....it would stop the screaming i can almost guarantee!!! they just want to be close to mommy at that age; they feel insecure on their own, they really don't realize that they aren't a part of you any more....and he's only been on the planet for two months, think how scary that would be for him...if u get too annoyed, put him in a safe place and walk away for just a few mins to get your patience back....don't worry, it doesn't last forever, i promise!  my dd is almost 8 mos and stilll loves to ride in the carrier, she will fall asleep in it if she's tired and if not, she has a bird's eye view of what's going on!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	There is no such thing as a spoiled 2 month old.  It's not possible.  2 month old babies don't cry because they want something, they cry because they need something -- and yes, sometimes that something is you.    This is why new moms don't get much done.|`|efmjyiJ4aa	first off- ur suposed to love your child unconditionally. they scream for attention- or when somethings wrong. theres nothing you can do but love your child! theres no such thing as a spoiled 2month old! I personally dont think you deserve to be a mom if you are getting annoyed by an innocent baby|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Um a 2 month old cannot be spoiled. He's only been on this earth 2 months, give him a break! He wants love and affection, which you can't give him enough of at this age. Where are your maternal instincts? For god's sake, just hold your baby! Buy a sling and take him with you. He is scared and is new to the world and needs to be held because he is building trust right now.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	He is only 2 months old...why the hell did you have him if you didn't want to be around him? Maybe he needs to feel comforted and maybe that is lacking? How could think that your 2 month old is annoying?|`|ctNNzYW6aa	My daughter was a baby drama queen too.  She got raging mad whenever anyone stopped paying attention to her, not just me. However, she was around 4 or 5 months old when she started getting attitude. Have you noticed if it happens whenever any other adult besides you leaves his sight?    Also, have you considered that a the presence of a rambunctious, three year old toddler might be having an impact on your son's sleep and on your nerves? Maybe you could use the child you take care of to your advantage.  At 3, kids always want to help. Let him or her tickle your son's toes or wave a rattle.|`|B0bqRhgnaa	It might sound bad but my son did the same thing just let him scream yes it is annoying but he will get the point that your not always going to pick him up when he screams and crys.it worked for me.you will feel bad but if you keep picking him up everytime he crys it will get worse his doctor told me to do it to and after a few days of not always picking him up he'll get the point.
iDOpQs04aa	While I have no doubt that she is responsible for the death of her child, I do not know whether it was murder, manslaughter, accidental, or what.  I tend to think it less likely to be accidental because of the failure to report from the onset and certainly to tell the truth by now if it it was an accident.  I have a hard time believing murder because I cannot imagine anyone killing her own child and yet I cannot forget the reports of the computer searches for various things that might indicate this was premeditated.  In the beginning I thought it might have been an accidental death from a chloroform overdose - that she was using it to knock Caylee out when she didn't want to be bothered with her and that she didn't intend to kill her.  But now I'm not so sure.  I mean what kind of monster drives a car around with the body of her dead baby in the trunk for days?  And duct tapes her mouth and stuffs her in a laundry bag inside a trash bag and discards her in the woods?  I cannot even imagine what happened but I certainly don't think that any nanny (or anyone else) had anything to do with this and whatever happened it was at Casey's hands.  At this point, for me I'm not sure it matters even if it was an accident, Casey is either a cold blooded murderer or a criminally insane person who should never be free to hurt anyone else. As someone else said, it's a good thing I'm not on the jury because there is no way I could be impartial or presume innocence on this one.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I have no idea.  I know how the media painted her.  I tell you what it is going to be hard for her to get a fair trial with all the coverage. There is no "best" punishment for a crime against your own child.  i'm just glad I'm not on that jury...|`|d5K8wORqaa	let the bit*h rot.  i hear in jail they arent nice when u hurt kids.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	I think she did it...   I mean like you dont tell the cops or anything till she has been missing for what a month....Sounds a lil suspicious to me..|`|r07BwhO1aa	I think she did and should rot for it.  She seems to be a very selfish woman who could have easily given her daughter to her parents but did not want to be looked at funnily for it so she just killed her.|`|AA12221392	I have watched this case from the beginning, and I do believe that all invendece points to her guilt.   I think the evidence will bring justice for this child.  I mean really you lie to the police over details, which isn't helping your child be found. Plus the whole 31 days had passed and she was just having a good time, she didn't notify her family she was missing.     I do wonder though the who is the father factor? MY reason is if the father really died she could of got social security for her child (as she is always needing money) . A caller the other night said something about caylee name, which brung me to think caylee- hmm- maybe it is casey saying y lee?    There was a report a long time ago that stated that she was abused by her father and that her brother touched her, but it got dropped and no one seem to mention it again.    I really dispuse this woman- but the chair isn't something I beleive in- i beleive to take her life would make it to easy for her. Make her life miserable while she can't party no more, no more men, make her life horriable in that matter.   But beleive me I have had a hard time not thinking about them giving her the death chair because she did something so ..... someone did love this child,the grandparents.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i thought she was not guilty but the more i watch and hear the whole story i start to think she did it. you have to be mental to do that. she had problems. if she got help for her problems her daughter might still be alive. the people that cant see why she did it do not really understand mental illness. it actually happened and you can do things that you normally sane would not do?|`|8p7uLYD4aa	I think she's a sociopath and she did do it (possibly on accident). However, I think Nancy Grace should be in the cell next to her for exploiting people on a regular basis and being an all around shrew.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	At first I had no doubt she was guilty. I still think she is, but there are so many weird things going on, I think we will be even more surprised as more details come out. I definitely think someone helped her, or it was an "accident" and she tried to cover it up. As for the reports of her using chloroform to put her to "sleep", that is just disgusting. I definitely think she caused the death of her child, some way some how.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I lost track of my daughter once for FIVE minutes when she was a toddler. I just about called out the National Guard.    31 days...and nothing?    The woman she supposedly left her with is a ghost?  No one lived in the apartment for months?    I believe she did it...and is mentally ill.  I think she convinced herself of something else...but yes. I think she did it, just like Susan Smith in North Carolina.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	Yes Casey is guilty, I feel so bad for the grandparents, they deserve to be left alone!! If you want to help the Anthony's please sign, and help to get RESPECT FOR CAYLEE!    Thank you.    Gaby    please sign:    http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/no-t...    Don't forget to copy the link and post it in your blogs, myspace, facebooks, or other media outlets....we need to put a stop to this!!      Oh yeah and also, they are giving people the option to choose from 3 different names now!! If you want to sell a doll and give to charity (as they claim they are going to do) then take Caylee's name out of it, and then try to make your money!  But that is something they'll never do. :(|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yes she killed her and she should get the death penelty|`|x9R9HxFiaa	I don't know how anyone can think for one minute she may be innocent. The first thing we heard when this first started was that she did not tell a single person for thirty days that her 2 year old was missing. She went about life like she was happy and Caylee was with the baby sitter. No one expected that anything was wrong.The media didn't make Casey look bad Casey did. Today seeing her in court she looks like she actually thinks she will get away with this. I heard her parents are starting to doubt her. It's about time. I know if my daughter was in court from something I felt she was innocent, I would be there to support her media are no media.|`|5qQPdUnhaa	TO ANYONE who thinks casey is guilty    HOW in the world is the state going to explain why they haven't turned over evidence to the defense that they were ordered to turn over MONTHS AGO!!!..     And NOW . they were ordered to hand over MORE within 14 days.. and FAILED TO DO THAT AS WELL!. and are trying to rectify it.. in court.      WHAT THE HELL was a meter man doing 45 feet into the woods when THERE AINT NO DAMN METERS THERE..    Taking a piss?? Bul***** he can take a piss behind anyone of the 100+ trees, shrubs and other various foliage surrounding the entire area..      Someone planted it there.. and someone knows more than they are saying and it ain't casey.. theres more to this story that neither YOU nor I know.. so everyone. SHUT THE HE*L UP like your thought really matters.. your just giving people tht DO end up on the jury reasons to feel sorry for her..     and dont spout off about dominic casey, if your really gonna listen to that bullshit story then you must realize that during their search they were where the body was found, and there was nothing there. NOTHING WAS THERE!! NO BODY. So tell me how it got there in august, dissapeared when 3 different groups searched because IT WASNT THERE THEN EITHER, and suddenly reappeared for the meter man that so far is the only one that was in those woods that "found" something in august..     seems kinda funny how 3 groups of searches say there wasnt a body there huh?? odd. i know.  its called SHADY!!     ohh and ALSO...  Dont say "her body was under water they wont hit"     Commonly known FACT about cadaver dogs and underwater decomposition. The scent rises to the surface of the water, if there was a body under the water, the dogs would hit not only on the water but anywhere the water had touched before receeding..       Face it ppl too much evidence points that casey didnt put taht body there. she was in jail.. and that body wasnt there when the cops searched, when TE searched, or when the other two crews searched..       Its sad that someone would do this, intentionally frame someoen else..|`|UeMz0uEBaa	All evidence, the lies everything points to that monster killing her daughter.  You dont need glasses, contacts or 20/20 vision to see that.  Her parents on the other side need to accept the monster that they raised disguised as a daughter and bury little caylee.  This little girl was thrown away like unwanted garbage treated like a dog who i have witnessed got better treatment than caylee ever did.  They need to put her to rest and her mother needs to be sitting in jail for the rest of her life.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	that c*nt is sooo guilty its not even funny.  i mean your daughter's missing for weeks and you don't bring it up thinking when her dead body turns up we won't look at you?  No really, she's a dumb stupid non deserving to live retarded c*nt and i hope she dies THE MOST horrid or horrid deaths.  Hell if i could kill her myself and not be charged, believe you me i would.|`|vt76wtBcaa	yes|`|gvgFfPwQaa	I think she is very guilty, but who am I to judge.. I just don't understand how anyone could kill a sweet innocent child.. there is something terribly wrong with someone like that.|`|tHYC3uPOaa	GUILTY and she should have the same punishment.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	she's guilty.if the evidence doesn't prove that then the process of elimination should and by this i mean she was the last one seen with the child and the last one to see the child.a babysitter who doesn't exist a job that doesn't exist. how do you pay for a babysitter when you don't have a job?i would like to see her get the chair and it is more likely a jury would send her to the chair now that the body has been found, but i still think they won't do it. if you think about it this case mirrors the susan smith story. in that one the mother accused a black guy of carjacking and kidnapping the children. but it turned out she did away with the children because a boyfriend didn't want them around. you have for the most part the same thing in this case with casey anthony playing upon racism to try and get out of this by claiming a hispanic woman kidnapped the child. you have the boyfriend who didn't want the kid there(tony lazaro and another one i don't remember his name).i'm a mother myself , and like you i can't understand how a mother could do this ..but it's painfully obvious that she did
XOtOMncwaa	No theres nothing wrong with your baby catching some TV every now and then... mine in the living room stays on all day... and my son will watch it for a second if a catchy Commercial or something comes on, and I do occasionally turn cartoons on for him... theres nothing wrong with kids watching TV as long as your aren't using it as a substitute for your love. Your baby shouldn't be learning from a TV, and shouldn't spend the majority of the day watching it. But theres absolutely nothing wrong with letting her watch it when she wants to.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	no I mean as long as he/she isn't watching it too close and not for a long time, my baby who will turn 5 months next week watches cartoons while I get ready for work in his crib, and I take like 20 mins.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	I think it is probably ok to have it on. My little Luke (who is about the same age!) is really intrigued with the talking box too. As long as you are interacting with her, giving her toys to play with, etc. I don't think having the tv on in the background is a big deal, even if she is interested in it.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Studies show it is not good for babies to watch television..     I guess it depends on the amount.. I know kids who watch tv 24/7     1 2 and 3 year olds (that I know) show signs that the watch to much tv..   acting A.D.D ... and have the worst attention spans ever..     Im sure 30 minutes here and there won't kill her.. but as she gets older I would watch her tv intake..     Also for background noise try talk radio or your favorite music..     Best of wishes..|`|AA11637178	The baby is watching the movements on the screen. It is fine for the baby to watch.|`|23MPcnNqaa	The color and movement on tv is very stimulating for an infant.  I would suggest buying some Baby Einstein videos for your little one to enjoy.|`|81IM9jeLaa	I think right now its fairly harmless. Like the others said, as long as you are not using it a substitute or for a babysitter it is fine. I agree that television should not be used as an educational tool. I bought baby einstein for my son, (when he was 6 months plus) and we watched the dvd's together. This way I could point things out, and say the words while letting him look at me. I think its the only way that tv can be benefitial for your child. BUT starting your children watching television too long, has shown to cause seditary life styles later on in life. I think books, toys, and baby play sets are much more benefitial.     SIDE NOTE.. something I found interesting: You lose more calories laying down with out watching television, then when you lay down and watch television! I dont know how it works, but I found it pretty interesting :)|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl is 3.5 months, and is absolutely mesmerised by the TV.  I am a SAHM, so I keep it on pretty much all do, even if I'm not watching it. I am always alone, and like the background noise!  But she loves it, sometimes I'll try to talk to her, and she'll try to look around me to see it!  I'm not sure if it's a coincidence either but sometimes if they show a face close up, so it's just the head (I have a pretty big TV, so it's a really big head to her) she'll start squealing in delight or talking, I think she recognizes them as faces!  It's so funny!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my 5 week old son always turns his head toward the tv whenever its on.  he lovess the t.v.. its fine for her to watch it.
2lDQktYjaa	I don't think what happened to you is the end of the world, but I dont think that it's the right punishment either. At your age, a good punishment would be to cut your cell phone, access to internet, TV, going out, etc... Those things would have made u freak out. And you would think twice before doing it again. Plus your parents or the school principal should have asked you to apologize to the teacher in front of the whole class. And for all of you who are saying they spank their kids, and ur parents should have done this. I totally disagree. When the parents are teaching violence to children, believe me they will get violence in return. All those kids in high school who are troublemakers, they were spanked or beaten as children. Otherwise they suffer from some kind of emotional neglect and are looking for attention. So yes discipline ur child, but do it in an intelligent and responsible way.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Cussing out your teacher is a very disrespectful thing to do. No matter how upset they may have made you, they are your elder and you need to show respect.  Unfortunately for the youth of today they are not punished at an early age for the things they do.    I would do the same thing and more if one of my children ever did that.  Cussing out anyone, or raising your voice to a person of authority is an absolute no-no.  If you had been my child, it would have been soap, grounding, and extra chores for 2 weeks for the first offense and an additional week for every other time after that, that you chose to do that.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	good for them , maybe you will show a little respect next time.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	It could have been worse.    That's just disrespectful and put shame on your parents.  I'm sure they didn't raise u to be that way...|`|r07BwhO1aa	All you got was soap in your mouth for 3 seconds?  I say you got of easily.  If my daughter ever did that. . . well lets just say she would be praying only for 3 seconds of soap in her mouth!!  What I would have done to my kid in this situation would border on abuse.  I am talking spankings, grounding her until she forgets what the sun looks like, and more than likely getting her some kind of shirt to wear that says something like "I am a punk who does not respect my teachers"  YOU GOT OFF LIGHT!!!    You acted like a baby and were treated like one.  Good for your mom and dad!!!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Iv read this q twice now...    Yes it was a right thing to do on your parents behalf.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Soap is abuse?  Nope - you got off easy - your parents are right to punish you and this is mild - you'd have been grounded big time if you were in my house (either growing up or now).|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	I'd call yourself rather lucky with just having a bar of soap in your mouth    ..let my daugther ever cuss a teacher or any adult for that matter...sheeshh she would be in for it!    EDIT - So alone...hmm.."it is wrong" yet "spit in his food"...oooooooook!|`|hGmq5IuZaa	call the cops have your parents arrested for abuse ...they are screwed up adults|`|jvW3a5GYaa	If you were my kid I would have popped you right in the mouth - how dare you disrespect your teacher like that??|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Is it right for you to keep asking this same stupid question over and over?|`|WBpanY8Kaa	First of all your parents have the right to discipline you.  You have no right to dishonor your parents by speaking that way to any adult.  And even having the nerve to allow cuss words come out of your mouth period.  It does not matter how old you are or how old any one else is for that fact using cuss words are not cool.  And what ever happened to RESPECT your elders?  You know people who are older than yourself.|`|AA11755924	And it wouldn't be abuse even if he did it for 5 minutes.  You have a dirty mouth?  It needs to be cleaned.  Period.  You need to learn you can't just talk rude or curse at anyone you feel like.  You need to learn some respect.     I do it with my kids when they decide to talk ugly.  I wash their mouth out with soap.      What do you do?  You take your punishment like you are supposed to b/c it will make you a better person in the long run.  I know you don't see it now but your parents do it b/c they care SOOO much about you and they want you to have a good life.  If they didnt' care about you then they wouldn't go out of their way to make sure you understand what they are trying to teach you.|`|TK03jZTuaa	I'm sure your parents meant well but it probably wasn't the best thing to do. having said that, I can remember that when one of my sons was 13 years old he had that done to him.

Once I lost the weight they receded significantly and faded to white instead of red, but they're still there.    I've been really surprised as my pregnancy has progressed--none of them have gotten red again or grown (and I've got them everywhere--my stomach, my hips and thighs--even my breasts and the backs of my arms and legs) which seems odd to me because my stomach is much larger now than it ever was when I was fat and my  breasts are significantly larger now than they were then too.  I haven't gotten any new ones either and I'm pretty close to my due date, so I have no reason to believe that will suddenly change.    I know it's not the same thing as being pregnant twice in a row, but it is my second time of having my skin stretched out and I haven't had anything new pop up or even the old return.|`|FSPAKELyaa	with my i got loads, the second was little so only a couple of new ones by my belly button, the third stretched me above and below the previous ones and now at 32 weeks, i have not a single new one. hoping it stays that way|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Depends. I only have 1 small new one in this pregnancy. I don't think I'll get anymore- I racked up on them the first time around.|`|44a6538785f4c813b7c382028c366213aa	The only stretch marks I got were on my breasts due to nursing...until my 3rd child when I got two small stretch marks one on each hip...and with my 4th baby I didn't get anymore than the 2 I had already. I'm lucky I have good genes.|`|APgtCPzGaa	I had all green pregnancies and just  "recycled" mine from the first pregnancy.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	With my first one I had an appetite the whole time (which is probably why I gained 50 pounds!).    This time I have no appetite. It has gotten a little bit better now that I don't feel as sick.    Just make sure you are getting the calories you need. You need 300 extra calories per day in addition to the 2000 you should already be getting. Protein is really important right now. Calcium is also vital.    Just remind yourself to eat regularly, your appetite will likely increase in your second trimester.    Good Luck!|`|5UcdeeX8aa	I never did. I just eat normally actually, and still gain weight.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	My appetite hasnt gotten bigger... just my cravings... for chocolate... I found it easier to eat more when my belly started to show more... 5 months...hehe. Its great to have an excuse to be fat... for awhile ;)|`|JDNDicPQaa	5 weeks in and i  started eating enough for me and my partner.. i am scared to i have talked to him about my butt and his told me hell love me no matter what... so what.,.. i care/... i dont want a huge *** actually i am more scared about my tummy... ahhh i think regular long walks.. lots of water???|`|EOIxLhBxaa	roughly 20 weeks I started eating more.
wi1ty2lbaa	I got pregnant on my second cycle of it. I have endo and pcos and the doctors recommended that I try it. I decided to give myself 3 months and no more. If it happened, then it was meant to be. It worked for me. I'm currently 8 weeks and thrilled beyond belief. I wish you lots of luck and baby dust!|`|k1l2jhr7aa	I took it for 3 months with what I thought was no luck, turns out I got pg on my last go. I was only on the lowest doesage. Good luck with it.|`|CD5JsjxKaa	no, but i'm considering it too. interesting question. will definitely be back to check out what answers you get!
PhkLLwVbaa	I had the headaches and I was absolutely exhausted I couldn't make it through the day without a nap. My stomach did cramp but the nausea didn't occur till the end of my 1st trimester but you haven't been pregnant before so you know that nausea and heart burn are different for every women i'm in my 3rd trimester and just started getting heart burn good luck either way.
irLnPW4aaa	Nothing out of the ordinary.   Here in CT, as long as the school is open for four hours, it counts as a 'full day'.   So early dismissal is always 2 hours early, a delayed opening is either 90 minutes or two hours and then it still counts as a full day.    If for some reason there were an emergency and school had to be dismissed before the magic 4 hour mark, the day would have to be made up at the end of the school year.  (Some districts build extra days into their schedule to allow for snow days, others don't).|`|PW3hcVZiaa	You'd be in luck, I would think!  But they'd be smart just to cancel the whole day, unless the entire school system wasn't on a half day.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	Way back when I was in school this happened. I was only there for like 2 hours. It was pointless. We just watched a movie and went home.|`|1SWAQe5Raa	you have no school|`|02ouBqEdaa	ther would be no school
rMNWd17saa	It is normal to go through different feelings about sex when pregnant.  You will probably feel unattractive for a while then as your breasts grow and your figure becomes more womanly and your hormones change you may feel more sexy.  One minute you feel totally uninterested, the next a sex crazed nympho.    Increased blood flow to the pelvic area can cause engorgement of the genitals. The heightened sensation that results may add to your pleasure during sex. You may have more vaginal discharge or moistness, which could also be a plus.  Your breasts may feel tingly, tender, and unusually sensitive to touch, particularly in the first trimester. The tenderness generally subsides, but your breasts may remain more sensitive. Some women will find this heightened sensitivity to be a turn-on.  To help you feel better and more attractive be sure to get a little exercise daily, take care of your self, your hair, your skin, let your nails grow a little.  When you are pregnant and taking prenatal vitamins you will find your hair and nails grow stronger, longer and healthier.    Enjoy this time to let yourself look and feel feminine and romantic.  Treat yourself to a nice facial, pedicure, prenatal massage.  Drink lots of water, use lots of moisturizer all over.    You can't help but feel prettier.    Let yourself glow!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,same here. Just drained and just not up for it.  You're probably just gonna have to wait it out until you feel better. No sense in forcing yourself into something you just don't feel like doing.|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	I was the same way.  Im 12 weeks right now and dont feel attractive any more and it is so weird.  I just mainly stay home now because of it.  I did have sex a couple times with my hubby but I didn't want it so much because I was always sick and he just deployed and now I want sex all the time.  Its really weird.  Just try it and see what happens I did it for mine.  I turned him on then he did the same back to me and it was really good actually.  Just try not to think about being pregnant if you don't want to.  It might help.
GU3RauKOaa	Oh jeez, that is gruesome. Wow. Ok, well here's what I would do:     1, like you said, talk to your doctor. See if you will be able to make milk with that breast and whether you can or can't see if he approves of you trying. Even if you can only produce milk from one breast you can still breastfeed and supplement with formula and he/she will still get the benefits of breastmilk.     2, if doctor approves try to breastfeed the new baby but if you have any signs of mastitis or anything at all go straight to the doctor. Just play it safe and hopefully it all will go well. Honestly, it will probably be better for you to breastfeed because you will be able to avoid engorgement waiting for milk to go away if you formula feed, and it greatly reduces your risk of breast cancer which is a good thing if you've had such a serious infection and surgery in your breast.    So if your doctor says you can, I would definately try. Just be very cautious and go straight to the hospital so if it got infected they would catch it early and it wouldn't be a problem. Good luck!|`|am4Vh0SOaa	WOW that is an amazing story, i feel for you!  I breastfed my daughter but the worst that happened to me was cracked nipples and that was painful enough that i was going to stop... for trying so hard you have done great...    I personally think if that was me, being there for my child is far more important than breastfeeding, if it happens again you may end up going through the same thing and then you might miss out on time with your new baby too... If it were me i would put my baby straight onto formula, i dont think it is worth risking your health to that extent because who knows how much worse it could have been...    I guess the best thing though is to speak to your doctor and see what advice they would give as they would know what sort of effects it would have with your condition... but my advice is spare yourself the pain and give your baby a bottle...     Good luck...|`|bzxPBkbtaa	I would maybe try and nurse and if you happen to start having similar symptoms-stop right away! The bonding is so great and it's so healthy but missing out on a month and the pain is certainly a high price to pay. Ask your Dr what the chances are of it happening again or do some research on the web on recurrence. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|78c2d087dcd8cfdc713abe3185e0b093aa	I am very pro breastfeeding, have done it exclusively for the last 10 months with my son and despite having a 1/4" crack in my nipple that I treated for a month, it sounds like nothing compared to what you have been through. In all honesty..I think I would go for it. It's a great experience that only mothers get to go through. Just remember that if it doesn't work out, or you have the slightest discomfort, you gave it a shot and be happy with that. You should be very proud of yourself for being so self-less to even think about it. Good luck!!!|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I would definitely nurse again, but I'd take every precaution I could to avoid mastitis. Good breastfeeding management and good support of your immune system can reduce the likelihood of infection.      I might not birth in that hospital again, though!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	personally, after all that, i wouldn't, but that is just me..formula fed babies thrive every single day....|`|cqgWkdPtaa	it is a very hard decision isn't it. I am unsure of what i would do, trying to put myself in the situation i think i would try again, but if i was actually in the situation (this probably sounds a bit crazy) i probably wouldn't try again and put myself at that risk again.     Good luck! I'm sure you'll make the right decision for you and your family|`|dwdLkvgPaa	If you don't try breastfeeding this time around you know that you are always going to regret not at least trying....and maybe this time it will be a totally different situation...I would def..talk to your DR and get their opinion though...good luck I hope it works out for you....and I formula fed my oldest and she is a perfect healthy 7 year old...so formula fed babies do turn out just fine..but I am now breastfeeding my 14 month old and it is just such a wonderful  thing to do|`|f1a1ffdf688a4450af60736209090152aa	i think I would try, the chance of you contracting MRSA again are slim, and you would be better prepared to handle the situation if it were to occur (but it won't!)    Formula is fine, but breastmilk is best.|`|wlAmUQe3aa	Sounds like you had a dreadful time.    I think if it was me, I would try to breastfeed 2nd time around and just see how it goes. Chances are you won't have the same problems again and even if you only manage to breastfeed for a short while it will be good for you & baby. Having had mastitis first time around, you are more likely to spot the signs earlier and get help before it becomes an issue.    If you do have to stop at least you will able to reassure yourself you tried which in my opinion is better than feeling guilty that you didn't even try in a few months/years (I'm a firm believer in regretting what you've done rather than what you didn't do).
iT0lzQxYaa	Well, when I look at the list, I automatically say no to Kinsley, Kinsli, and Kallie.    Jasmine is cute. Love it!  Kimberley is o.k.  Clarissa is way to old-fashioned, but you could give her the nickname "Clara", which is cute...  Alisa- Personally, I dont love it, but is doable.   Esabella- I love it! Its my favorite name on the list. I love it spelled this unique way, but the traditional spelling is great to!    Hope I helped!|`|SRmvOp0daa	Kallie is beautiful.  Clarissa is nice... what about dropping the "L" for the name Carissa?  All of your choices are very pretty.  Remember, it's difficult to ask others' opinions of names you already like, because you're bound to have people tell you they hate a certain name...|`|WyQuDaRyaa	Jasmine is one of my favorite names!

Jasmine is on my list of favorite girl names. Alisa is ok but I like Alisha better.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Jasmine is the only decent one.    Callie is a nickname, not a name. It is childish and will not age well. The spelling is trashy.    Isabella is common. The spelling is stupid. Not one will spell it right.    Kinsley is a masculine boy's name, changing the spelling does not make it feminine.|`|rev4lrn0aa	I like Kinsley|`|3YdDpReTaa	Go with either Clarissa or Kimberly, all the other ones (especially jasmine) wouldnt fit this generation.|`|nZgatTIHaa	Alisa is the cutest and will work nice for all ages.
QsbB6vkoaa	i think yeah he might be using you because, if he really wanted to end it with her, obviously he wouldn't have to tell her or his best friend the reason, they could just break it off and after a while just say that you guys got back together, but that it was after they broke up.  unless maybe (if this is possible) he wants to be with you both, you know? he might think he's in love with you both. so it's completely up to you, i mean i've heard of relationships where the guy has two women for years and at least one if not both of them know it. so it's all about your pride, if you don't put a stop to it, he'll keep getting away with it. my advice is to end it. to show him that you respect yourself and you want someone who loves you and only you.  you can still be friends but i wouldn't fall back into his web. i mean you totally deserve better. and if he's happy with her, then you shouldn't stand in the way. i hope this is the advice you were looking for and if YOU have any more questions then you can e-mail ME.  i wish you the best of luck!!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It sounds like he is having trouble telling her, he wants to end it.  He needs to make up his mind.|`|GahMjygBaa	all u have 2 do is be friends with hi until he leaves her...n if he doesnt than jus move on but u guys can still b friends|`|3mnYzbPVaa	You are going to be upset. I'm shocked you're not more upset now. He's cheating on his girlfriend with you and is leading you on.     You can do better. For what it's worth, you sound incredibly intelligent; it's just hard when your emotions are at stake.    Try distancing yourself from the situation. If your best friend came to you and told you this exact scenario, what would you tell her? Everyone is better than to be played by a boy. That includes the other girl.    I wish you the best.

abae6afaf05cd4433e382fc342911d20aa	I have the same problem with my son as well and my doctor said not to worry. He said as long as he has the hang of it before he starts Kindergarten.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	My son didn't want to use the toilet either.  I've heard that boys often take longer to train than girls.  If you're concerned, talk to your doctor.    If he can hold it in, he can learn to let it go.|`|f38b3ba8ee6fe6a37654c84a1d5ac013aa	It's normal for a "he" to have problems early on. 3 years I don't know, sounds like he'll get the hang of it though.|`|fe73ce81dfcc877ddc8594063a1d9ba1aa	According to an article in Babycenter.com...  There's no magic age at which toddlers are ready to start learning how to use the potty, but most develop the necessary physical and cognitive skills between 18 and 24 months of age (although some won't be interested in the process until they're closer to 4).    Your child may be ready to start toilet training if he:    ? Can walk and sit down    ? Has regular bowel movements at relatively predictable times    ? Can pull his pants up and down    ? Shows interest in others' bathroom habits (likes to watch you go to the bathroom, wants to wear underwear, etc.)    ? Makes a physical demonstration when he's having a bowel movement (grunting, squatting, telling you, etc.)    ? Has words for stool and urine    ? Can follow simple instructions, such as "Go get the toy"    ? Understands the physical signals that mean he has to go and can tell you before it happens or hold it until he has time to get to the potty    ? Dislikes the feeling of being in a dirty diaper    ? Has "dry" periods of at least three or four hours    ? Isn't negative about  or resistant to  learning to use the toilet    ? Understands the value of putting things where they belong    ? Demonstrates a desire for independence|`|YjuVJbxSaa	swat him with a newspaper and put his nose in it then promptly put him out side|`|OkR3hrzZaa	I wouldn't push it. Most of the time the more you push it the less they want to do it. Remind him that he is a big boy now. Show him how daddy goes potty. Try a reward system. Reward him for when he does go on the potty. Make a big deal out of it. He will eventually go when he is ready. Every child goes at different times. Maybe get him some cool big boy underwear. Like spider man or something. Make it a fun thing for him to do. Good luck!|`|AA10325134	I have a 3yr old myself and he is just not wanting to be potty trained either.  They know when they are ready.  All we can really do is keep showing them how it works and soon enough they will get the hang of it.  Don't pressure him cause he'll get even more discouraged to start.
5874b168a91acd80d681a74971367f53aa	Oh dear sweetie. I've tried doing that so many times. It NEVER works. But some tips on how to not is talk to your friends. If you hang out with your friends or talk to them, you forget about guys for a moment. Absorb yourself in your studies. xD  Don't listen to music because for some reason, music always makes me think about guys. I think because all the LOVE songs.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Just think of all the guys that turn your stomach and, make you want to vomit.|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	IDK!!! I could NEVER do that!  Ummmm.. why are you doing this?|`|ncfo2aJZaa	Just think that all guys at this age are immature and can't even hold a strong relationship. All they want is a good social status so that's why they ask girls who they think are "hot" out. For that reason only.
APgtCPzGaa	I had "Restless Leg Syndrome" with all my pregnancies, due to poor circulation which is common when you are pregnant. Your weight distribution is off and you are supporting another life so everything is all whacked out.  For my legs I would rub Icy Hot on them to get rid of the feeling long enough to go to sleep.   But you should let your doc know what you are felling, they should be able to help.|`|SnyDa8Claa	This is normal.. very normal especially when sleeping. Sometimes it is caused by sciatica... or it can be caused by swelling (whether you notice it or not)|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	normal normal.|`|s3WdcVknaa	it is just how the babys positioned it cuts off circulation
9OsjdsrZaa	Your fundal height should be more or less the same as how many weeks you are...+/- 2.  If your are measuring large, your Dr. may send you in for another Sono., to verify your dates.  Another thing they check for is Gestational Diabetes.  Women with GD often measure a week or 2 ahead.  That is not to say that you have it!  So don't be too concerned. (I know, hard to do when you are pregnant).  Yet another thing is how many children you have.  Some women with more than 2 kids measure larger because their muscles are all stretched out.  Me...I have a double whammy.  I have GD and this is my 4th. I am 32 weeks along, and measure 3 bigger (35).  I went in for a sono and everything was fine...I am just having a very large baby.  ;-)    Good Luck!|`|XWPAjxsGaa	how ever many weeks you are is spose to be how long your baby is in cm. your measuring 3cm bigger then the average baby but dont worry i have been the whole pregnancy aswell.. then i measured 4cm bigger but not he has stopped growing for a little bit and im only 2cm bigger then the average baby. your baby is probley just having big growth spurts like mine lol.. but then again i am having a baby with a my tongan boyfriend and tongans are big and tall so our baby boy takes after his dad!!  :)    congratulations!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Supposedly the cm measurement is supposed to be the same as your weeks.  So at 26 weeks you "should" be 26 cm.  But I know for a fact that even doctors don't find this to be that reliable because when my nurse practitioner measured me as big she remarked that the OB/GYN probably wouldn't agree.  And at the next visit, sure enough, my OB/GYN tsked and said the the NP always measured too big.  They were being funny about it, but really, it's an inexact science.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	It should be the same as however many weeks you are, but it can vary depending on your body type.  I am measuring a few weeks small, but my baby is measuring a week ahead so who knows.  With my daughter I was measuring really small and they thought that she was going to be really small, but when i went into labor 2 weeks early she was born 8lb 5oz.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	if I knew the answer to that I would be able to tell how far along I am ! Wish I knew!|`|6avKnzkoaa	Normally fundal height is supposed to correlate with your gestational age. However, measurements aren't always precise. As long as your doctor isn't concerned you should be okay.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	At my 24week appointment i measured 26weeks. But after an ultrasound at 27weeks, i have been told im having a small baby even tho i am "carrying" big.    I dont think it makes too much of a difference
dQ1S6IoFaa	Theres everything from beginning of your cycle to the end....   HOPE THAT HELPS      Each month, in one of a woman's two ovaries, a group of immature eggs start to develop in small fluid-filled cysts called follicles. Normally, one of the follicles is selected to complete development (maturation). This "dominant follicle" suppresses the growth of all of the other follicles, which stop growing and degenerate. The mature follicle ruptures and releases the egg from the ovary (ovulation). Ovulation generally occurs about two weeks before a woman's next menstrual period begins.    After ovulation, the ruptured follicle develops into a structure called the corpus luteum, which secretes two hormones, progesterone and estrogen. The progesterone helps prepare the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for the embryo to implant by thickening it.    Release of Egg:    The egg is released and travels into the fallopian tube where it remains until a single sperm penetrates it during fertilization (the union of egg and sperm; see below). The egg can be fertilized for about 24 hours after ovulation. On average, ovulation and fertilization occurs about two weeks after your last menstrual period.    Menses:    If no sperm is around to fertilize the egg, it and the corpus luteum will degenerate, removing the high level of hormones. This causes the endometrium to slough off, resulting in menstrual bleeding. Then the cycle repeats itself.    Fertilization:    If sperm does meet and penetrate a mature egg after ovulation, it will fertilize it. When the sperm penetrates the egg, changes occur in the protein coating around it to prevent other sperm from entering. At the moment of fertilization, your baby's genetic make-up is complete, including its sex. Since the mother can provide only X chromosomes (she's XX), if a Y sperm fertilizes the egg, your baby will be a boy (XY); if an X sperm fertilizes the egg, your baby will be a girl (XX).    Implantation:    Within 24-hours after fertilization, the egg begins dividing rapidly into many cells. It remains in the fallopian tube for about three days. The fertilized egg (called a zygote) continues to divide as it passes slowly through the fallopian tube to the uterus where its next job is to attach to the endometrium (a process called implantation). First the zygote becomes a solid ball of cells, then it becomes a hollow ball of cells called a blastocyst. Before implantation, the blastocyst breaks out of its protective covering. When the blastocyst establishes contact with the endometrium, an exchange of hormones helps the blastocyst attach. Some women notice spotting (or slight bleeding) for one or two days around the time of implantation. The endometrium becomes thicker and the cervix is sealed by a plug of mucus.    Within three weeks, the blastocyst cells begin to grow as clumps of cells within that little ball, and the baby's first nerve cells have already formed. Your developing baby is called an embryo from the moment of conception to the eighth week of pregnancy. After the eighth week and until the moment of birth, your developing baby is called a fetus.    Pregnancy Hormones:    Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) is a hormone present in your blood from the time of conception and is produced by the cells that form the placenta. This is the hormone detected in a pregnancy test; but, it usually takes three to four weeks from the first day of your last period for the levels of hCG to be high enough to be detected by pregnancy tests.|`|OCk7I8JVaa	I really think you should look this up yourself on the internet. I don't know how you expect this question to get answered on Y!A???|`|cBgLqUigaa	Semen does not reach the ovaries. In fact your ovaries release an egg into the fallopian tubes. The sperm are deposited near the cervix which is actually the bottom of the uterus and they swim a long way through the uterus and into the fallopian tube where the sperm penetrate the layer around the egg. The sperm can swim in the semen and cervical mucus with a little tail (looks like a tadpole) to the egg in the fallopian tube. The egg is continually moving down the fallopian tube and eventually reaches the uterus. If it has been fertilized in the fallopian tube it the shell around the egg goes through a series of changes as well as the uterine lining and implants into the uterine wall and starts releasing HCG which causes the body to keep producing the estrogen and progesterone to support the pregnancy until about the 10th day when the placenta takes over this important hormonal regulation. Hope this helps!  http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-repr...|`|PFO1jxZGaa	well its all connected and the sperm swims thru uterus to the fallopian tubes( that are connected to the ovaries) and once the egg has been fertilized the egg moves down to uterus and plants itself to the wall lining.. its all designed to know what to do and where to go... google it :)|`|6igjX2cnaa	Hmm well i looked up stuff on Wikipedia.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_conce...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantatio...    It swims through the cervix, up the uterus, into the fallopian tubes and fertilizes an egg if it's there.  The egg then travels to the uterus where it implants in the uterine lining.  Best wishes hun!|`|b7eyDnSAaa	The egg travels out of the ovaries, through the falopian tube, and into the uterus. It hangs out in the uterus, and meets the sperm there later.  The sperm does not go to the ovaries.

Probiotics - You may have heard of Acidophilus, a healthy bacterium that lives in our intestines and often added to yogurt. You can buy another probiotic with Lactobacillus bacteria in from any vitamin or drug store. One brand I recommend is Culturelle?, one caplet daily. For young children, parents can empty the caplet into any cold food or beverage. Research has shown that taking this probiotic can shorten the duration and severity of diarrhea.|`|qPz4Dem3aa	Yes, my son had a reaction to an antibiotic that he was taking for a sinus infection that caused bad diarrhea and my doctor recommended mixing formula, pedialyte, banana baby food and rice cereal into a bottle and feeding him that. He was 7 months old at that time. It was kinda like a baby fruit smoothie, lol. Every ingredient combined is a great way to slow down the bowel movements. Good luck!|`|ac0rRBHCaa	GO SEE A BABY DOCTOR NOT PEOPLE ON YAHOO ANSWER|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I would.|`|6opidS31aa	wow don't go to yahoo answers for stuff like this go to you doctor are you willing to bet you child's life on something someone thinks they know?|`|dqSA7j7gaa	Yes, my son was 4 weeks old and haveing alot of mucus still, since babies cannot clear their throats. So the doctor recommended doing a few bottles half formula, half pedialyte to help thin out the mucus. Since milk (the formula) causes more mucus.

0JBXD87uaa	It shouldn't hurt much if you both are careful. Make sure there is plenty of lubrication (natural or otherwise), go slow, and talk to each other. Let him know that stop means to stop right now, not in three more thrusts. Go slow to start. Do not be afraid to tell him to slow down at any point in time. If you ever feel like stopping, then tell him. If he loves you, he'll want to make sure you are happy and enjoying the experience too. You should get plenty of pleasure too if it's done right. Talk about it before you do it, make sure you set up the rules first so it can be enjoyable.     RELAX! I cannot stress this enough. Clench your lips together and try to stick your finger in your mouth. It hurts, but if you open and relax your lips it goes in easier. Same concept. Talking is the best distraction to calm you down. Breath deep and talk about how you love each other. Let him know what this means for you. Before you know it, it'll be over and the worst part will be behind you.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Trying using spermicide lubrication.

GGH0HVdvaa	I live in my parents house and I'm going to college. I have an active social life, in that I almost always see my friends several times a week to hang out and so on. these are friends I've had since junior high and high school, plus some new people I've met at work and such. You dont HAVE to be active in the college's social life to have your own social life. Just letting you know that a dorm isn't the only way.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Living on campus helps you grow up and interact with people.

Finances did not allow for him to stay at a dorm and go to the school he wanted to.  However, he stayed for the activities and participated in the ones that he wanted to.  As an adult, he didn't have a curfew but was requested to call if he was going to be later than midnight - only because the rest of the house wouldn't be able to settle down worrying about him.    Outside of a few house rules, which were agreed upon, he seemed to be reasonably happy.  And, yes, he would have loved it if we could have afforded  for him to go in at least his last two years.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You don't need to live on campus, to be involved in campus life.|`|6Bg9eeyBaa	I am in community college, it sucks. That's just my personal opinion but I miss a lot of my friends who all went off to college.. I would recommend you try staying on dorm first just so you can see which one you like best. Staying at home is not fun especially when your in community college there's not really as much to do at community college. Community college is basically about going to school getting your work done and then coming home.. There's really no party's are fun events like football games and stuff... Overall it just depends on what type of person you are, If your a sociable person you might prefer staying on dorm.

fy69hAeQaa	I don't think you should mess with their names. I mean how often do you use your kids middle name anyway?    Their mother chose those names for her kids and I think it would be very disrespectful to her memory to change them. What would you tell the kids when they got older? "Um your dad and I hated the names your biological mom who passed away when you were very young gave you, so we decided to change them"?    This might give them a little insight to who their mom was. They are not going to remember much about her if anything at all. This shows a little of her personality. Have you thought of it that way?     I think it is selfish of you and your fiance to want to take that little part of their mom away from them.|`|JEUHWyY2aa	I agree that those names may seem a little ridiculous, but I think you should leave them alone.  I agree with the other poster...it's disrespectful of their mother that passed away.  She chose to those names, obviously put a lot of thought and effort into it.  Now that she is gone, it is one of the only things she can leave them with.  Let them make that decision when they get older.  I understand why you want to change them, but honestly...how often does your middle name come up as an adult?  Not very...|`|cg3IaThxaa	WOW. just a little while ago,  what was it, 3 days or so? you were asking that question, 'is this a suspicious question", or whatever it was, about your bf possibily be hinting towards proposing.   now you're engaged with two 3 year olds.   and you're like what, 19? life moves fast, huh?  so are you going to keep your job as a nanny? 8 kids would be a handful.  as for the names, i'd say don't change them. they may be horrible, but how often are you going to use their middle name? as long as the first ones are good, then it's ok. and besides, the children might grow up hating you if you did that. their names are all their mother really left for them. :*(|`|44OH7Si6aa	I hate the names, Lukas and Stella are fine, but I absolutely hate the middle names.  That being said, no you shouldn't change them. They may just be unique names she pulled out of baby books, but also maybe those names had some significance to them. She gave them life and obviously thought these names were right for them, you may not get it, no one may get it but by taking away those names you will be taking a piece of her away from them.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I would defiantly change the names do they carry the last name of the Dad? I would let the kids find a name they really like to be their middle|`|DD5CMWfkaa	He can legally change their names yes. You would have to go to the Social Security office.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I'd just keep them, honestly they aren't that bad, you don't have to call them by their middle names. Personally, I think that it is a little disrespectful to their mother to change their names. She was the one caring for them until her death and you don't know the story behind the names (they could have meant something special to her).|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	You should keep them but tell them to choose what they want there names to be when there older! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|we0xPfYLaa	Is that what your fiance wants too?  I wouldn't change their first name.  Actually to be honest I wouldn't change their names at all.  They are used to those names and its already difficult for kids to learn all of their names and then you are going to change it.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	yes that is EXTREMELY disrespectful to their passed mother.    i can't believe you would even consider it to tell you the truth.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I would definitely change them. Its more disrespectful to the children to keep the names as they are. I would keep one of the middle names though. Maybe Stella Maiya and..well..maybe pick another one for Lukas. If they were 10 I would say don't change them, but they are 3.|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes you can but keep theyre 1st names.|`|AA11265535	I would say keep their first names and at least one of the middle names. What about keeping Stella, Maiya, Lukas, and Finn? And you can add a name or whatever. Like make it Stella Jaelyn Maiya and how about changing Finn into Finley? Stella Jaelyn Maiya and Lukus or Lucas Finley Alexander|`|pzgPsne9aa	I would keep the first names, the children are already confused and sad by the death of their mother, you do not want to confuse them more by changing their names. But I would consider changing their middle names.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I think it would be pretty disrespectful to their mother whom i'm sure loved them dearly. I know i named my daughter with the two favorite names (Mia Grace) and they mean SO much to me.   I think you should just leave their names like that (even if they are a little distasteful) but just don't include them on anything...You don't really have to use them.  My brother has the most horrid middle names because of my grandads passing. My mother said he just never has to use them. And he doesn't on all school work and other documents its just Eban England. Instead of Eban George Branfit England. Ugh.    So yeah, in England you can change them by 'deedpole'...search on how to where you are.   But in all honesty? I don't think you should.    That's just my truly honest opinion x    EDIT: PLus, unless their mother was a monster, then i think the children would respect you for keeping their names given by the mother.   If they hate their names?   They can change their names themselves when they are older.   Give them the choice.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I'd change them definitely! They will not know til they are grown.They are only 3 for heaven's sake.I work w/ the public.It's a nightmare for people to have such names in life, not cute! That said, Stella Maiya and Lukas Finn are both adorable,modern names! God Bless!|`|CxRJwJsraa	Well, I think I would first talk to the grandmother or someone who might know the reason why she chose those names. Perhaps there were special reasons for them.    I'm not sure I'd legally change them. But I might shorten them for casual use. For instance you introduce them and someone asks their middle name, I think I'd just give them one instead of all of them. Or if they are in trouble and you "throw in the middle name" just use one. know what I mean.  I think I'd go with Stella Maiya and Lukas Finn.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Wow! Those names are quite unique to say the least. I personally would change their middle names. i would suggest Stella Marie and Lukas Michael. Simple and pleasant names :)|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Well if i was that child an my mom died an you changed my name as i got older i might be mad at you for this. Thats something their mother gave to them. To me that is wrong. She gave birth to them not you.|`|W1aunDG7aa	I have a friend who was adopted by her aunt and uncle after her mother passed away. They changed her middle name from "Ivanna" to "Rose"; which she resents. She's eighteen now, and changing her middle name back.     I don't think you should change their names, even if they are weird. Those are the names their mother gave them. It's incredibly noble and wonderful that you are adopting these children, but it's not like you're adopting a newborn baby. These kids have a history. I would keep their names but it's totally your choice [:    Good luck with everything!|`|4ilM2hCwaa	If you two agree, than, yes, you can change the names. I also suggest keeping the best of the lot and dropping the other two middle names- perhaps Lukas Finn and Stella Rae, dropping the ze. This can be spelled out in adoption documents if you go that route.  Adoptees names are often changed - President Ford's birth name was Rudolph King.  I would suggest also that grandma might not be thrilled with your plan.  So you may want to consider just ignoring the middle names, without making anything official.  Its your choice, but it may wind up being a thorny one.
AA11762804	trust me I know, Im 17 (going to be 18 in april) and i just found out im pregnant, Im keeping my baby and I think you should keep your baby since you have your mother supporting you, Who cares what your b/f thinks its not his body and he dose not have to deal with the after effects of the abortion, all the physical side effects and emotional side effects that can really ruin your life. If you dont want to be a mom then go for adoption or if  u want to be in the childs life but not have to raise him/her then go for an open adoption      Anticipated side effects following an abortion:  The following is a list of side effects that are frequently experienced following an abortion. It is possible that you may experience these side effects for up to 2 to 4 weeks following the procedure.     Abdominal pain and cramping   Nausea   Vomiting   Diarrhea   Spotting and Bleeding   Potential more serious complications following an abortion.  Although serious complications only occur in less than 1 out of 100 first trimester abortions and approximately 1 out of every 50 late term abortions; it is important to know the possible risks:    Heavy or persistent bleeding   Infection or sepsis   Damage to the cervix   Scarring of the uterine lining   Perforation of the uterus   Damage to other organs   Death   It is important to understand that these risks are rare and some are even present with child birth. What matters is that you are aware that they exist as you make an educated decision about your pregnancy.    If you have had an abortion, call your doctor and seek medical attention if your side effects become severe or if you experience any of the following:  Severe abdominal and back pain that prohibits you from standing up   Bleeding that is heavier than a normal menstrual period   Foul-smelling discharge   Fever above 100.4 F   Continuing symptoms of pregnancy       The choice is up to you though not your b/f Good luck and congrats!! =)|`|mLbydsVIaa	dont worry if your mom is there to help i would deffinitly have the kid. ill be a junior in HS next year and my baby is due in the summer..so just be happy your not as young as me and other teens.follow your heart dont do what your BF wants if its not what u want..its your body your baby not his...its not right that he wants you to have an abortion. things will work out but plz w/e you do...dont abort..you will regret it later on and it will always be in your head and youll never know about what coulda been..  just keep it. your BF isnt a very good BF if he wont be there to support you and want the baby.  good luck and hope this helped :)  e-mail me if you need someone to tlk to|`|W9amt8xEaa	In the end it is 100 Percent your decision. Please I see so many woman that regret getting an abortion later on in life because there husband "wasn't ready, or didn't want a kid" and then things didn't work on later down the road and they were devastated even more. I know it's hard taking the advice of someone over the internet over your boyfriend whom you see all the time... But you have to plan for the what ifs and you most definitely shouldn't get an abortion because your boyfriend wants you to! My ex broke up with me when I found out I was pregnant and I was only 15 years old, we'd been together for 7 months and he had given me an engagement ring and being as young as I was I though he was the love of my life and I'd do anything for him. He told me that I would make a terrible mother, and couldn't handle a baby on my own. It was a Huge Heartbreak, and unfortunately... I didn't keep the baby :/ I was scared and thought that if I did it that he would take me back. It was the most devastating time of my life. & I don't think much about it to this day, because we make mistakes and I have a good life going for me now & that guy I was with... He ended up in Jail. But if I could take it back... I would in a heart beat. I would have ditched his *** and had my baby. Pleas take it from someone who has been at the point where she had to make a decision and know that it's something you can't forget.|`|LZVZkSHUaa	Follow your heart I would never tell you what to do.  I do feel like you have to live with your choice for the rest of your life so choose wisely make sure you can handle the choice you make.  As far as the boyfriend.  Break up with him he's a jerk!!!  Don't except him to be there for you if this is how he feels, he won't be.  Get on medicaid and wic and go on with your lives a child is  a blessing.|`|k1l2jhr7aa	I just want to say that I wish you luck in what ever decision you make. It will proberly be one of the hardest one you have to make in your life. You need to really think about yourself her and not your boyfriend.   Bringing a child up can be very hard work, but it is also a very rewarding thing, hearing my son call me mum was one of the best days in my life.   At the end of the day its your choice, do what your heart tells you.   Goodluck|`|BonyOJLRaa	Follow your heart. Don't let anyone dictate what you should do with your body/life.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Instead of abortion give a couple who is unable to have children the opportunity to raise yours as their own.  I do not believe in abortion. If you absolutely don't want or can't keep the baby, give him/her to someone who will raise and love that child and give it a chance in life.|`|7uqOSZNKaa	babe it shouldnt be a hard decision for you. you said yourself that your against abortion so dont do it. the pros are... no baby to tie u down, ur young free and single. but the cons are this.... you will feel guilty for the rest of ur life. u may even get pregnant a few months later just to fill the void, i did. u will never come to terms with an abortion but u will with a baby. being a mom u will get used to. and even if it takes time to enjoy being a mom your own mom said she will. having an unplanned pregnancy is not the end of the world but abortion will rip a big part of u to pieces, if u dnt regret it straight away, i guarantee one day u will. raising a baby, even if u have help is damn hard but when uve had that abortion and u realise what youve done, is waaaay harder. just my opinion x|`|AA10186411	Who gives a crap what your boyfriend wants?  He shouldn't have slept with you if he didn't want to have a baby.  You BOTH knew what you were doing when you had sex, so no child should DIE because of it.  Tell him to screw off, he is a loser.  Your mother can help you through this.  If he doesn't want a part of it, you don't need him!|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Rather your boyfriend wants you to get an abortion or not, he has NO say so in this situation its totally up 2 YOU.    That's good you will have your mother for support, how sweet of here.    I just don't see how any one could kill an innocent child that didn't ask to be brought into this world. If your wanting to go abortion, have you thought about adoption?    Just remember, if you do go threw with an abortion its just going to be a guilt feeling & heartache the rest of your life. Something you will think about every single day.    Good luck on whatever you decide to do.|`|zgBelCROaa	This isn't the place to be asking this question. You need to think about this for yourself. We are complete strangers with our own opinions and can not decide for you. Having a child at a young age will forever change your life and hold you back. BUT will you be able to live with yourself if you have an abortion or do adoption??? Take your bf out of the situation and think for yourself.|`|Wn4tjazIaa	It's not your boyfriend's choice. Whether or not you decide to have the kid, he can always leave.     Pros:  You don't have the kid.  Your boyfriend will possibly stay with you longer  You don't have to possibly compromise your future for your child.  Some people will congratulate you on being such a forward thinking woman.    Cons:  You will wake up and every morning you may remember than you killed your child.  Your boyfriend might leave you anyways.  You may have side effects, including never having being able to have children again, or suffering miscarriages later.  Some people will judge you for having one.  You may not abort at the clinic, and may abort at home, at school, in a public area.    Have you considered having the kid and giving it up for adoption? You get to choose the family, you might be able to choose one that would live near you, might let you see the kid if you want, or might live on the other side of the country.     If your mom is supportive of you having it, you might try listening to what she says too. Having the kid might put a strain on you both, but not having the kid has a potent ital strain too.      Good luck with whatever you do!|`|Spm9Raz9aa	it is not your boyfriends choice. if you wil have the support of your mom.... keep the incredible miricle growing inside of you. that is going to be an amazing gift that looks just like you! do not get an abortion|`|gG8oyymiaa	If you are going to get an abortion don't do with an excuse.

Who cares what your boyfriend wants. This is you and YOUR body.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Dont so it if its not what you want!!! Your bf doesnt really have a say what you do to your body. Make a decision based on what YOU want - you will have to live with that choice.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	If your mom said that she would help you, keep your baby!! It's awesome that you have such a supportive mom. It wasn't the baby's fault that it was created. Abortion isn't a good option. If you're against them, then don't get one. Your boyfriend should support you in whatever decision you make, and he should man up and take responsibility for it too!  Do you plan on going to college? That's something you have to think about when making this decision.|`|47eiwyMLaa	It's a scary and exciting time to find out that you're pregnant--even if it is unplanned. Life doesn't end when you have a child, it's just more interesting :)    Look, you have support, you have a good head on your shoulders because you're thinking about your future. I believe you could be a good mother even if it is early in adulthood for you.    Your boyfriend may be scared and may not want the responsibility. But please remember there is someone else about to come into this world that needs a voice...your unborn child. Life is sacred and a miracle...don't be the one to snuff it out because of fear of the unknown (how you would take care of a child). Have this child, and if when you hold him or her in your arms and you still don't think you can be a mom, then give another woman a chance to be a mother. Research all your adoption options, as there are different kinds of adoption.    God bless and grant you the strength and will to do what is right.|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	dont let him pressure you.  u have support and love around you.     Abortion will leave you a lifetime of regret.  there are no pros.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	keep the baby :)    i'm 18, just finished school and my boyfriend and i are thrilled to be having a baby. like me, your mom is supportive and loving as well.    good luck.|`|01vMpHkWaa	you dont want to abort  then dont  screw what your bf wants|`|c612db5f7eaf689dc523cb1c679189e1aa	Why not give the child up for adoption.

Me and my husband had to spend money to do fertility to have our daughter and our 2nd due in March.  There are so many people who can't have babies that want them.  I don't know how I ever lived without my little girl as soon as they put her in my arms I fell in love with her.  Its great you have a supportive family and this should be your choice.  Its not always gonna be easy if you keep the baby but being a mom is the most rewarding thing I've ever experienced.  Keep the baby!!|`|0d7AjfXjaa	There is NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER any reason to have an abortion, it is murder!!!!!!!! Either keep the baby or give it up for adoption. You should learn to take responsibility for your actions, instead of just killing the "problem"  seriously do not be a murderer|`|quSN2WVjaa	If you are thinking of abortion (although I disagree with the idea that you're only thinking about it because of your boyfriend), I would get information about it from an INFORMED organization, such as planned parenthood, where opinions and personal morals of others will not interfere with your choice.     If you believe an abortion is right for this situation, don't be influenced by other's personal opinions of abortion. Which is why I don't think asking that on yahoo answers is a great way to go.     Goodluck either way.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Umm Its up to you not you're boyfriend why don't you do Adoption|`|AA11293601	I am against abortion as well... your mom seems very supportive in your decisions, and i think that is awesome.    Your boy friend on the other hand.... not so supportive. Its a not just a one lane highway to get in to that situation. He Needs to understand that. i also hope you have told him that you don't like abortions.    there is another option...    Adoption. If you don't feel like you are ready to take on the responsibility of a child, i hope that you at least consider adoption. Most people cant have children and for someone to give another person a gift of life is extremely cool and considerate. You just have to think  about the after affects of that as well.    but let me tell you this... My younger cousin got pregnant her senior year, the daddy of her baby refused to take responsibility. but she decided to keep the baby. and she feels it was the best decision of her life. Her parents supported her, and they help out when ever she needs it...    So in my opinion, if the boy doesn't want to own up to something that it took two to get that way, you WILL be fine. i have Full Confidence in that... your moms seems supportive enough that she will be there for you. Just please don't consider abortion..|`|3WccV3Kzaa	Yes mastakes happen  but now that you have it has you have to make up your mind not your boyfriends and I would make him  help support you and the baby because it sounds like he wants out of the responceabilty of wanting to care for you or the baby  a baby is one of the greatest gift you can have I know you said your parents are behind you and that shows how much they care for you and the baby and you are still young and have a lot to learn life is not fair all the time and this is one of the setbacks but life can be wonderful  a mistake can help you learn  so next time you know what to do. hope you have a good life and make the right decision your self because you are the one that has to live with it
FkGh0LuWaa	No!  Look in the phone book.
BjY1iZS0aa	This sounds like a typical 3 year old to me. One way kids learn is through repetition. Even if they know something they sometimes will ask what something is a million times - they might think "oh yeah, I knew that." Also, I think they can feel overwhelmed if youre pushing too much. If they really don't want to play, or answer, they will do the "I dunno" even though they do. At this age, they also like to see what power they have. He might see how not answering is frustrating you, and that is fun for our 3 year olds. One thing I would do with my son is maybe say "what does a cow say? Should mommy answer or you answer?" If gives them control over it, and at first my son would say mommy, but as I went along with other things he would say "me answer" and he would. That's what I did when he didn't want to dress himself anymore either. Every morning I would say "Do you want mommy to dress you, or do you want to do it." It's amazing how giving them a little bit of power changes things. They are at an age where they want to feel in some sort of control of their little lives. Every day we make so many decisions for them, and they want to start to make some. So even simple questions will get them to be a little rebellious - cause at least he is in control.     He is definitely just being a typical kid. My son is now 4, and I can say, 4 has been harder then 3, so get used to their defiance. I just try and find creative and fun ways to get around their testing moments.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	i guessing maybe he wants to spend more time with you. if he doesnt see a lot of you, he might be trying to get you to spend more time with him.|`|cUfOnldzaa	He's either playing a game, or seeing if you know the answer to a question he does (making sure the answer is the same).  Or both.|`|olF9Hl6saa	My son is 4 and he does the same kind of thing. He is a very smart little boy but he will ask me silly things like "are you my mommy", and I'll say to him "Am I? What do you think?" Or when he knows we are on our way to  school, he's ask me "where are we going", I will tell him, "hmmm.. I don't know, where are we going".|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	3yo's do that!! My son is 3 and always asks question repeatedly. It drives me nuts.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	My instinct would be that he's looking for more interaction. I wouldn't look to curb it if my instinct is correct. Because he knows, I definitely think having him answer his own questions is ideal. I would confirm that he's right.     Do you reward him when he correctly answers a question? Even a "Good job!" is a positive reinforcer. He may just be looking for to get more of that reward. If you think this might be the case, after prompting him for an answer, I would immediately follow it with a related question with an answer that he has not demonstrated knowledge of repeatedly.|`|gSteSrogaa	My daughter is 3, and does much of the same thing.    To asking the questions he aleady knows the answer to...I'm guessing he does it because he is mimicking you. My daughter asks the same  questions, and I have seen my daughter do this with other things as well. She may ask a question about a story and I tell her "Turn the page and find out". Now, when we finish reading the page she says "turn the page and find out!" and turns the page. When she asks questions about things she knows (much like your son), I just redirect the questio back at her. "I don't know honey, what is his name?" and usually she tells me.    I am working on getting her to do things for herself. She knows "Mommy help" if she can't get something done, and sometimes I think she is too quick to jump on this opportunity. For example, she got one of those Elmo K-nex things for Christmas. She can put it together, but sometimes has a little trouble. If she can't get a part together it like 2 seconds, she is quick to jump on the "Mommy help". I tell her "You do it. You'll never learn if mommy does everything for you."|`|hGmq5IuZaa	well he wants more elaborate info ..be more colorful and creative in your responses ..youre probably boring him with the same old answers..To me, you sound like your not too into your kid...or kid interaction|`|PrxlHUT5aa	this is synonymous to kids asking "why?" after! every why... even to those things they already know the answer to... and I quote:    "Your child's inquisitiveness is a signal that her mind is expanding quickly, and that she's curious about the world...It's also a way for her to engage you in conversation, and keep you talking...try to deflect them by asking her what she thinks. Her answer may amuse you, but try not to laugh  her mind is really working in amazing ways as she puts together what information she has about the world with a toddler's fertile imagination..."     A child needs to know that her queries are being taken seriously... no matter how silly it may sound to us adults.  Since your son seems to enjoy answering question when you are being playful to him, then make it fun everytime you have a Q&A session.  Having fun is key to a child's learning!
UUpsa35Daa	Because a game system does nothing but make you a couch potato while piano lessons make you a well rounded individual and tutors benefit your future.    I would have killed to have my mom devote money to music lessons and tutor and art lessons but she didn't. I had to work hard for my A's without any outside help other than teachers and i learned how to play piano and violin on my own.    Be thankful for what your parents GIVE you. They're doing things that, in the long run, will really benefit you.|`|sxecXFgraa	Maybe they need to spend more on tutors...|`|HyknHVV5aa	You should be happy that your parents let you buy clothes from hollister, ae and a&f. You could be one of those kids who have to wear all their clothes from Wal Mart.     Your parents don't agree with gaming systems. Tough luck. You best luck is to ask for it at Christmas and birthday, otherwise ask if you save your own money if you can buy it.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Because Lessons teach Discipline, & Games waste time & money... So it sounds like your Parents Know what they're doing...  :)|`|8GyAPfmRaa	yo the same thing happened at home with me but the thing is that maybe the piano is a family thing or something like that. Maybe one of your family member used to play the piano or they just want you to learn. so they saved up as much money as they can to get the piano. (maybe)|`|wZAeBisbaa	Maybe they feel that after Hollister, American Eagle, Abercrombie, piano lessons, and private tutors that they've given you enough already.  Why do you think they should give you even more?  Maybe there is something you can do to earn your own money and save enough to buy it for yourself.|`|DobKxnWBaa	because playing piano makes you more cultured than a mindless video game. just wait until college it gets better|`|mic9KYaOaa	because they dont want you to fool around ...  they want you to play piano till you know it damn well huni  xx|`|EnBhiRp3aa	it's not about the cost. it's about what you're getting out of it. money isn't everything, dummy.|`|NWFpvM9Gaa	Depends on your grades and you behavior. Try improving on both and maybe you'll get the stuff you want. Parents aren't obligated to buy ou stuff.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	LOL, because your parents are making a differentiation between things you "need" and are good for you, and things you "want" and probably do nothing to benefit you. Sometimes it sucks being a kid, doesn't it.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	their $$$ = their priorities. They see clothing, even name brand clothing as a need you have, and piano, tutors, lessons etc as ways to enrich you as a human being. Sounds like you should dig deep, stop obsessing about what you do not have, and thank them for all that you do,|`|OYgtlTEfaa	Do some odd jobs and pay for your own game system. Your parents will be proud of you.|`|6sAbs2iiaa	I'm sure your parents knows what they are doing.Why don't you ask your parents  this question I think they can give you the best answer .|`|wNg4ZXPZaa	they dont want to get u one because ps3's are something that in the way of ur education. trust me i know.     please check this out and add me on myspace and subscribe on my youtube i will be adding videos this week.....

I think they expect you to be a well educated and mannered person instead of like most kids today who don't have much to show for themselves.
8Zmt87LOaa	Have you decorated her room "special" or even just got her new pillowcases with her favorite tv character on them?   That may help.  Avoid any soda pop or other things that may have caffeine or sugar in them and she might sleep better overall.  After reading some of the other responses I feel that I must add this...don't use any tactic to scare her.  Don't tell her that monsters are under her bed, etc.  That will mess her up. So many people have this same problem but eventually they get too big for it and go on their own.|`|1b013cc3fe2d25b057fd14f52569f85caa	A radio with a sleep timer    a night light    and a mommy who will not allow it to go on....    SIT with her, hub her head...until she falls asleep....do not sleep with her!!    you may need to loose some sleep to break this cycle    give her a benadryl 30min. before bed...it will make her a bit sleepy, and is completely safe    do not make "deals" or bribe her to stay in bed...you'll pay dearly for that later in life.    be a parent, not a friend...you do not need to be mean or punish....but you do not want to bribe...worst idea ever|`|AA10241682	Well that's your own fault, you could have just given her something for the pain, she wouldn't get into the habit of sleeping with you so now you have to suffer the consequences... You need to talk to her pediatrician|`|9mSIQA2Baa	You just have to keep with it. I know it's very hard but just keep putting her back in her bed. It will work trust me!|`|VKlIjfIXaa	Watch Supernanny.|`|Lf03hCx4aa	try to sleep with her in her bed .... if its big enough.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Tell her you will get her a treat if she stays there the whole night without disturbing you.  If she does it then buy her something.  And do that for the first week but the prizes get a little smaller each time.  Then you just put her there and leave her and she should be fine.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	stop letting her sleep with you should be enough|`|8airt9MLaa	give her inscentives to stay in her room. maybe an extra cookie or something. after a while she'll get use to it. and maybe don't go cold turkey. allow her to sleep in your room like once a week|`|gvgFfPwQaa	According to Super nanny, put her in bed and make her turn off the lights and stay in there with the door closed or slightly cracked. Close your door at night and lock it. if she gets up, take her right back in there again.. trust me you have to do something... my mom let me sleep in her bed and I was terrified to sleep in my own bed until I was 12.. you don't want to live that kind of life. Reinforcement works wonders.. She will eventually get used to it.|`|AA11559211	bribery worked for me i would behave for a dollar  or set a time they have to stay in bed and keep lengthening that time  3hrs 4hrs 5hrs so on they will learn time early too|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	The usual suggestion is to leave her in her room and tell her she is not allowed to leave, then return her to the bed every time she comes to you.  You can't restrain or lock her in safely, so you just have to keep forcing her to return.  It doesn't matter if it starts a whole night of drama--or even many nights of drama; other than forcing her to be alone and coping with the resulting pain, there really isn't another choice that I know of.|`|CjFQJ0Xxaa	Well you could tell her that she can't sleep in your bed anymore, because she is a big girl.  Ask her why she wants to sleep in your room, and try to convince her her bed is so much better than yours. Maybe even set up a sleeping bag in your room, and tell her that if she really needs to sleep in your room, she can sleep in the sleeping bag. She will probably rather sleep in her bed than the sleeping bag. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|SezRy8asaa	Give her an incentive to stay in bed at night. Ice cream and new toys are good ones.|`|0couzAHaaa	for my niece, we told her that if she would be a big girl and sleep in her bed, that she would get disney's princesses on ice tickets and that motivated her to sleep in her bed, and she is four as well.|`|3yltQ2Euaa	I had this problem as a little child- My mother slept in my bed, and it helped me get use to sleeping in the dark. After that she went into the kitchen and said you  can still here me and the door is open. So I could fall asleep when I could hear her. The only time i was scared was when i knew i was the only one not sleeping. I think you should not give her all the attention she's asking for. If you make a big deal about it, it will seem hard for her to change. She wont notice it if you don't talk about it too much. You have to work gradually too. So much to think about, but don't worry, every mom goes through this! And the problem always ends :)!|`|WLynh3bCaa	Supernanny has a very clear method to deal with this kind of thing, but when I was little, my mother had the same problem with me. For a almost a week- she would sit outside my room until 3am and spank me a few times (with her hand, on my clothes) each time I came out. You need to get a grip on this before she gets any older, good luck!|`|739d0573262dcbbe7e80cf6b3b90ad03aa	oooh yeah that's tough my daughter slept with me until she was about 2 and a half and it was so hard to break her habit but if u sleep with her it will be harder because then U will have to start sleeping in her be too....the only way to do it is to be consistant with her it's gonna be hard and im not even gonna lie to you and she will cry maybe kick and scream my daughter would cry until she threw up and the only thing u can do is keep consistant it went out for a couple of weeks but eventually she will understand but be consistant! the more u give in the harder it will be for both of you put her to bed and tell her straight, u must stay in your bed...  good luck|`|44OH7Si6aa	Keep putting her back in her bed when she gets out. it may start a whole night of drama but they get over it once they see you mean business. You can try offering a reward, such as a toy she really wants or offer to take her to build a bear so she can make her own little friend to keep her company in her big girl bed. Bottom line though is do not let her sleep in your bed again no matter how dramatic she gets, how tired of fighting you get, or how sick or injured she is. If you give in just a little bit she'll push it for even longer|`|iMULlxdgaa	Enlist the help of the bedtime fairies... if she stays in bed the whle night leave her a little present from the fairies (you don't have to go over board check out your local dollar store and get stickers, coloring books etc:.  anything she might like)  So like tell her if she stays in bed the fairies will be happy with her and maybe even get her a special night light that will watch over and protect her at night (maybe try and find a fairy night light)  Make it something magical..kids like that especially at 4 years old they'll eat it up!|`|UDJuxRdMaa	tie her up to the bed|`|1s6mQJqOaa	My dad would wait outside my door with a wooden spoon and when every I got out of bed I got a swat on the rear, I learned very quick that it was smarter and less painful to stay in bed! Good luck!|`|SoFeInwKaa	1. Lock her in her room  2. Tell her that monsters will get her if she sleeps with you    Sorry that's all I got.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Well that was your big mistake, letting her sleep in your bed in the first place. If they are scared yes, sick sure, but to continually let your child sleep in bed is a  no-no! You built this new dependence!    Now you're going to have to try to unbuild it. Sleep with her for a couple nights, show her theres nothing scary about sleeping in her own bed.  Dec out her room. Get her to pick out a cool lamp at Wal-Mart, maybe get her to a pic a colour to re-paint her room, or even get her a blanket with her favorite character on it. Something that makes her want to go there.  Read her a story in her bed before she falls asleep, a comforting consistency.  Every night she sleeps in her own bed (without crawling into yours) she can get a little chocolate. Every weekly check point, maybe a trip to McDonald's, every monthly point, maybe to the movie theater!|`|AA11644298	you might try sleeping with her in her bed for a while.  might help break the habit.|`|60UGQvMSaa	Reward her for being a "big kid" and sleeping in her own bed. Worked for me when I was little. :D|`|NuiHXYuOaa	sit with her in her bed till she sleeps.    if she wakes up and jumps in your bed. carry her back to her own bed and put her back to sleep (yes daunting) eventually she will get comfortable in her own  bed.|`|IRFaBtr4aa	Try using lavender scented candles and make the area quiet. Lavender somehow helps the body to relax. Try to sleep with her for a while as well!       Good Luck!!!
wcYRxDw2aa	Well you do bible studies and depending on how long it is depends on how many points they usually range from 2 - 6.  If you go to church and bring back a bulletin within 30 days it is 2 points if I'm not mistaken.  And watching movies is only 1 point, but if you get family to do any of it with you then they also get points for you.  I didnt do classes I just watched videos and did the bible studies.
VMASMHX6aa	Without wanting to get too technical, you could only get pregnant one week before your period if you have a short luteal phase. In this situation the womb lining will come away before the egg has a chance to implant.  Most women ovulate 12-16 days before their period.    However, it's very hard to know exactly when your period is going to come. You could have sex a week before you THINK your period is due and get pregnant.     So generally, you can't get pregnant a week before your period is due as that would be past your fertile phase. But it's always possible to have a longer cycle where you ovulate a week before you *expect* your period.
x4uGfC4oaa	The pill doesn't work like it should when you're taking antibiotics.
Bt3Hvh5Saa	get scrapbooks in the goody bags or during the party you could make some-- you should prob want a theme somthing like dogs or HSM or JB whatever she likes. The u will want a piniata and for the cake you will want it to match the theme and you could do a dougnut cake! or a cupcake cake!  hope i helped!|`|DOYYKLgEaa	Have her help out with the themeing - go to the shops together - you can pick out some quite nice album kits for a reasonable price.    Also I've never met a kid that didn't like chocolate cake!
AA11763588	You're going to waste a lot of money buying test if you test early. I know it's hard but just wait till you miss your period, this will give you the most accurate results.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can't test until it's been at least 14 days. It's highly unlikely you'll get a positive sooner, most women don't. Also the spotting is most likely not pregnancy related. Implantation doesn't usually happen this early. The earliest I've heard is 4 days but it's usually 5-12.  I didn't spot with either of my pregnancies|`|44uorNhOaa	test when your period is due or after u miss it. good luck. right now to early to tell.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	You wont get an accurate result till 14days after sex.    Test after you miss your period to get an accurate result|`|QJDbG1F1aa	The best time is test is always when you miss you period. Get a 5 day early response test. It detects the smallest rise of the pregnancy hormone that is secreted in your urine.|`|Spm9Raz9aa	you should usually test about nineteen days after intercourse. once you've missed a period or a couple days before. i test will usually always give you a negative if its olny been a week or two.|`|TUp54Eyaaa	I had spotting and cramps starting at 7dpo. The spotting lasted until two days before my period was due, and I'm still having small little cramps now (5 weeks). I didn't get a BFP until I was a day late. I KNOW it's hard, but it really is best to wait and test if and when you miss your period. Good luck!

HcCYeLMAaa	your mom shouldn't pass judgment on your friends daughter ! i would sit your mom down & talk to her & make sure to get your point across , like really make her think about what she'll be doing to that child if she doesn't let her stay there with you .|`|kRaVa0Wraa	tell your mom that she wont have to do a thing, and that you'll do everything.   also tell her that you need to help your friend.|`|Lftu0e4Daa	Your mom may have disapproved of your friendship with her because she was probably worried that you would get the idea to have a baby too. Just explain the situation to your mother, she will definitely understand considereing she is a mother. She would want someone to take care of you if she couldnt.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	The baby should stay with her family.  It is an imposition on your Mom to take care of a 2 year old and a big responsibility.  I would say no too.|`|4U9y2pLBaa	Explain to your mom the whole situation. Im sure if she has any feelings she will let her stay. And tell her you will watch her and do everything. If she still says no maybe you could lend your friend some money for the baby's fare down, because obviously she can't leave her 2 year old daughter on the streets. She will just have to bring warmer clothes for the baby.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Don't try to convince your mother.    Just take the baby for the two weeks.|`|YWekskHcaa	just explain the situation to you rmom. you wont no her answer till you ask.|`|NxNrZksXaa	tell your mom not to think about how much she doesn't like your friend. tell her she needs to think of the baby, and her mom is trying to make a good life for her and her child and the first step is by going to visit this college. also tell her that the little girl will not have anywhere else to stay, and that you are the only one your friend trusts to watch her child. hopefully that will change her mind.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	I'm assuming that you aren't going to be home for the duration of the two weeks. The intended caregiver has every right to say no. Where are Ashley's parents? Where is the baby's father? Why does this fall to you?    Unfortunately, having a baby at 15 entails some sacrifices. It's unfair to expect your friend's mother to take care of your baby.    As a note: I never indicated that the child was yours. I asked why the responsibility for the child fell to you. As I asked where Ashley's parents are, I clearly acknowledged the child is hers. The last line is explaining that Ashley's expectation to have her friend's mother take care of the baby is unreasonable. Further, I assume you have school and a life of your own. Who is taking care of the baby then? Presumably your mother.|`|WLynh3bCaa	Honey, your friend Ashley and your mom are the adults here (since she's the one with a kid). Let Ashley talk to your mom, that's all you can do. Overall, it's nice that you want to help your friend, but you're too young to deal with this and it's not your problem.  (Just a comment- what do you mean about the weather in Connecticut? I live there and it's just New England weather in general- yes it's unpredictable, but you don't have to worry about hurricanes, tornadoes or tsunamis, it's never extremely hot or cold, the snow rarely gets that high, the hail isn't too big, it never floods, etc. it's really not that extreme)|`|MUOaCtj6aa	explain to your mom you really dont want her to miss out and she is a good friend and say what happened to your friend is in the past it already happened and nothing can change that. You can also say what happened to her wont happened to you and list all the pros.
49fd9dd81cd8edeb86be5ea81f7c8b7daa	Thanks for the humor. Some readers take everything too seriously.     Mayo Naze....|`|Elxuvon8aa	you made me laugh  more than a little weird|`|sOgLLlDraa	haha. this is a joke right.|`|AA11825776	Sorry, I don't think Mayo is a good name at all.|`|aBqJhdufaa	HAHA nicee! Oh, somebody named their kid Hershey, and their last name was Bar!|`|pzgPsne9aa	Stupid|`|3OL7vVLuaa	I think you should name her mustard instead ;-)|`|7U3RQBLtaa	uhhh YES!|`|mbu5LD02aa	it dosnt matter as long as your happy with it but you should also think of what she will think of it when shes older. i dont think she will like it.then again i dont really like it so dont name her that she will be so mad like omg you named me mayo. i hate mayo lol|`|XRLbqtUbaa	oh plz...|`|AA11481862	no. my child is named catch and my husbands last name is up.|`|nTcHpDhmaa	yeah, but it is up to you. you just have to remember that kids are not nice sometimes, i was reminded of this multiple times when considering names for kids, i finally decided on Atticus and Daegan and i still get told everyone is going to atticus dickus and make fun of him, so i guess just take into consideration how mean kids can be|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	srry i think she would be made fun of for the rest of her life. She would probably change it when she turns 18 anyway. But if thats what you want go for it.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Yes, VERY weird. Not to mention inconsiderate of your future daughters feelings and self-esteem! Guess what nickname she'll get? Whitey probably. It's the color of mayo. How about May instead? Or Maya, Mya, Mia, Mary, Marie, Maria, etc. Good luck! =)    EDIT: I must have missed it before. I just saw that the last name would be "Naze". Gosh, get a frickin hobby besides trolling Y!A, will ya?|`|9mSIQA2Baa	Um yeah it would be weird.|`|NxNrZksXaa	lol! no, i say go for it... haha!|`|8EOsR96eaa	uhm yeah i would suggest not naming your daughter that|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	no its complete normal i got a son named mustard and a daughter named ketchup.      Edit: they also did a study today with kids that have werid names or names they don't like have a higher rate of doing crime. Not joking|`|525243e90d7dd23ac229f228b24cac54aa	no, i think it would be lovely for your daughter. she'd be thankful to you for the rest of her life.|`|j0VVVHwSaa	I like mustard better...|`|6jN3g0x8aa	This cannot be a coincidence - you are joking, right?|`|2o9EyFXSaa	um, i don't think she would be treated very nicely in school with that kind of name.|`|1ZGZeW7Zaa	uh...no. the kid will go through a lot of bullying at school. have some mercy.  on sec thought, YES name it that, after all my real name is vinegar and my sister's name is tobacco|`|6lBWoKrgaa	lmao go for it|`|AA12218482	I love it ------ all of my children have unique names|`|AA11612766	Not as bad as Mustard.|`|KxBPpzgIaa	are you craving mayo|`|dRTpDI2Faa	Well, she would not be taken seriously later in life... ex. applying for a job: they look at the application only to see the name is Mayo...       And kids won't treat her well at all in school.    Sorry to seem rude.  Just being honest.|`|WoEsehoRaa	It's cool but I don't know if your daughter would think so.|`|hpenz9hdaa	Mayo Naze... I wouldn't recommend it, so much teasing. Maybe she could take your last name?|`|AZy4fAaHaa	Why do people like you ask these dumb questions|`|Km74BXFjaa	It is a cool name. But I don't recommend it. The child may get made fun of. Try Talia.|`|7o27vGPvaa	As long as your last name is not mustard...
EMPVvJcDaa	I like Tiffany Anne! That would be my name minus the E!|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like Alexis but not with Mary I do not like tiffany Anne at all   Alexis Anne is okay toogether  or I like Jolyn|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Alexis Mary, I like the best|`|Tc23KWgzaa	ALEXIS MARY.    TX Mom|`|VJpdmd0waa	Alexis Mary|`|PuRpsENEaa	Alexis Mary. One of my favorite names is Alexis. But I think Alexis Tiffany is cute! :)|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Alexis Mary|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	Alexis Mary|`|JCK4sKfPaa	I think I like Tiffany Anne more, but I really like them both!     Hope I Helped! ;-)|`|E2UXN7J1aa	Tiffany Anne |`|9mSIQA2Baa	Alexis Mary|`|R9AAhsIjaa	I like Alexis and Tiffany (Tiffany Alexis?!) but if I had to pick one over the other, it would probably be Tiffany Anne because it's not as common as Alexis.     How cute would it be to call her Tiffy?!|`|CQhOyJOaaa	Alexis mary but i really like Alexis marie(mah-r-ee) lexi or alex for short|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Tiffany Anne.I like Mary Alexis better!|`|r0Ni4JJDaa	Tiffany Anne|`|hpenz9hdaa	Alexis Mary|`|fBsfuYqEaa	I think Tiffany Anne, but then again -  it depends on how well it will flow with the last name .|`|er8hefmSaa	tiffany anne. i know people with both of these names :)|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	how about Tiffany Alexis?|`|9e15c701ebcac9c70e264c1a2782d6e4aa	Tiffany Anne seems best, Alexis Mary just doesnt seem to go well together to me|`|YyU8rVULaa	TIFFANY ANNE|`|JvtdOyNzaa	ALEXIS MARY!  Or Tiffany Alexis, I really like that.|`|c9bdb3ad3698e1bb4ed0383822c061c8aa	Alexis Mary  Tiffany Anne sounds like a cabbage patch kid.|`|CNPxMi6uaa	Alexis- Protector of Mankind  Mary  - Bitter   Tiffany - three, the Trinity  Anne - Gracious    So I like Alexis but not really Mary, but overall I still prefer Alexis Mary. They go well together.|`|nZgatTIHaa	Alexis is better
qgJLZPDJaa	i couldnt agree more.  i am THE BIGGEST ***** EVER since ive been pregnant.  but they just dont understand :) hahah|`|rjVALevtaa	All men are not @ssholes. Have you considered that you might just be subconsciously attracted to men who aren't going to treat you well?|`|6avKnzkoaa	Partially due to hormones on the woman's half and perhaps individual's experience. Some women will have supportive partners from beginning. Others won't until later. And others won't have supportive partners at all.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Lol i thought so too :P  you're just hormonal!  :]      CONGRATS!!!|`|AA11763588	Because you're hormonal? Not all men are @ss holes... just an FYI.|`|KxBPpzgIaa	i dunno im 7 weeks preg too and i totally agree!!!!!!!!!! they just dont understand what we have to go through while being pregnant
UUpsa35Daa	I was the tallest PERSON in my grade from kindergarten to 8th grade. Taller than girls...taller than boys...in 1st grade, i was taller than my teacher!    I'm 17 now and i use to hate my height...i hated being that different and picked for being so much taller. But around 6th grade, i just learned to love it. I learned to rock who i am and just be happy with it. Once i was comfortable with myself, everything was a lot more better. I'm 5'11 and thankfully done growing.    But just be comfortable with who you are. Love yourself and everybody else will follow! :)|`|86oPkfzOaa	:-0!!!!! My mom is 5'6 and my dad is 6'4! I was 5'5 by age 10, so I would say that by the time I am thirteen, I will be that height as well.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Sounds like you got your dad's genes, when it comes to height.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Yes that is fine. Your parents are both tall people, so you will probably be around your height as an adult, and girl usually stop growing by the time they are 14-15. So, you will be tall now especially around boys, but once the boys are 16 they will all suddenly grow!     Don't worry about being tall, embrace it. Join the basketball team.|`|AA12221392	my 14 year old son is almost 6'2.  And he is still growing ....|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I would say its pretty normal because my brother  was 5'7 at 13. We have tall genes in our family.|`|TlA1SmrLaa	lol its probably because of your dads genes. im guessing your the tallest one in your class, probably of your age in the whole school. it is odd but its not abnormal at all.|`|SdJEVO53aa	its all about your parents DNA cells. if your 5''8 then your parents must b tall. obviously your dads tall so you must get your height from his DNA|`|Tk8x6WDhaa	didn't u ask this 4 months ago, instead you were the mom|`|K4GbcfdYaa	It's ok , i was 6''0 by that age , fit for a model ,like me . Hey if you want to do any modeling or catwalks , email me ok ?|`|FNPtBW9eaa	No it's not normal.  There is no 'normal' for what weight, height or body shape you have to be.  People come in all shapes and sizes and I'm sure you are beautiful at 13 years old and 5'8.|`|1dVoVp1gaa	:O im ur height too but im 14 and theres this 1 guy in my grade and hes 6'0 is it normal for ur age to be that tall no not really but it helps ALOT in basketball and volleyball|`|wNg4ZXPZaa	im 15 and i am 5'9  yea it is normal.        please check this out and add me on myspace and subscribe on my youtube i will be adding videos this week..... PLEASE HELP ME OUT:] ooo and comment            http://www.youtube.com/user/heleneimmel    http://www.myspace.com/heleneimmel|`|UmobeP5Saa	well i think i was about that height at that age|`|7ugNMjHpaa	yeah, its normal,  i know this guy and hes 13 in the 8th grade and hes 6'2"   lol, so no worries=)
E2UXN7J1aa	Normally you don't feel movement when you are pregnant until 18-20 weeks. By that time you would probably be aware of pregnancy.     It is possible you are feeling your own heartbeat in your stomach.|`|AA11763588	If you just became pregnant you wouldn't feel a heart beat. You do know you can feel your own anywhere on your body right?!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	The "heartbeat" in your stomach is probably your own - there is a major atery that runs thru your abdoman|`|efmjyiJ4aa	u wont feel movement till 16-20 weeks prego sorry|`|APgtCPzGaa	You can rarely feel the baby move before 12 wks, and only if you are thin (no extra weight to get in the way) and if it is not your first pregnancy. Most likely it is your stomach, gas or your own pulse.
0JBXD87uaa	It's best to put your birth day information  2/11/1993 Then they know for sure where you stand. Most applications ask for birthday anyways, not age.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You should not lie on a job application.  You will, either, not get the job or, get fired after you got the job.|`|MUOaCtj6aa	no because they will think you are turning 17 on your birthday if they don't look closely enough
xOvPuyfHaa	I think you are fine. You wouldn't be experiencing pregnancy symptoms just a couple of days after having sex. It takes up to ten days for it to attach to the uterus, and if you are having a regular period, you are fine! You're just paranoid, if you are still worried, talk to your gyno, but i honestly think you're just fine    :}|`|IxG2SMlEaa	If ur having a normal period then 9 times out of ten ur not pregnant Although it could be implantation bleeding. But implantation bleeding is usually lighter and shorter than ur normal period. It last from a couple of hours to 2 days at the most. But if your skeptical test now it could be a miscarriage or heaven forbid an ectopic pregnancy. Im quite sure its not that though given that type of pregnancy is painful. But test now..|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If you got a normal period (not a lighter, shorter one) then you're not pregnant.  If you're really concerned take test 3 weeks after your last unprotected sexual encounter.|`|100ZUVzfaa	UMM... if you have your period you're most definitely NOT pregnant...  it's physically impossible... unless you're beeding for some other reason...|`|0kWkX8yiaa	you cant get your period when your pregnant...so no you are not pregnant.. dont waste your money on a preg test|`|unBSAR6zaa	It is very possible to have your period and still be pregnant. So you should just wait a week or two and take a pregnancy test if you want to.|`|UYYe3NfZaa	if you are on your period now and used plan b correctly, and you used condoms you are more than likely not pregnant.  if you have to, take a test after your period goes away, when its negative, feel relieved and try to be more diligent with birth control in the future so you never feel this way again.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I think you can always pee on a stick ;)
5k0FKWTSaa	I highly doubt that the umbilical cord was CLOTTED at delivery - the baby would have been stillborn if it was so! Could you have misheard what the midwife/obgyn said? Was it KNOTTED?    There can be knots in the pplacenta (due to baby playing somersaults in the womb - sometimes true knots can occur, though not all that commonly), and the knots can vary from loose to tight. In most cases, the knots are loose,... and at delivery, as baby comes down the birth canal, and if the cord is short, the Knot can tighten, and contribute to fetal distress.    But babies can be born limp and not breathing for all sorts of reasons.    If it was only for 2 mins, that's good... could have been worse, as some distressed babies might require resusitation for much longer.    If your son was born limp and not breathing, often midwives/OBGYNs would take a sample of blood from the cord to test the pH and base-excess (these will give indication as to whether the baby was truly in distress in labour). Somtimes, tthe blood in the cord gets clotted once baby's delivered, and that may be what they mean by it. SO they are not able to get a sample to check the PH.    There is no reason why you cannot have further children... and healthy ones! :)|`|SnyDa8Claa	Wow, I applaud you for taking on a task that is challenging to most adults, at your young age.      I think it is called vasa previa.     I'm glad your son is okay.
WKgDpBR5aa	omg D=  now im depressed  i miss the 90s  me and my daddy used to watch dat together  =O  its called the big comfy couch  the lil dolls name is molly and the clown is loonetee or something like that?  lmao  xD  with that show i learned the frase  "liar liar pants on fire hanging on a telephone wire"  i still remember the episode and till this day i use that frase  ahhhh  the good ole 90s|`|0uhRgfcsaa	the big comfy couch! :)|`|MjfQETUoaa	OMG!

Baby dust right back at ya!!|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	My period will be about one day late on the 4th, so I'm right where you are.

n6XYYyoLaa	as long as his poop is not hard pellet like stools, and he is not uncomfortable or straining really hard, he's fine....they don't always poop every day, esp if they are bf..|`|gyoylefvaa	don't worry your baby is fine. if your  baby not poop in 3 day call your doctor right way.|`|u0qU6DzZaa	This is totally normal. Breastfed babies can go an entire 7 days! Don't worry about it.  Also if you FEEL (mothers intuition) there is a problem, try a chiropractor. The results will speak for themselves.|`|AA11865529	Please, don't give him a suppository any more. THose things are harsh and not meant for babies.    Baby's have a wide variety of schedules. My sister's kid used to only poop once a week for the first six months. (But there was a lot.) If you are using formula, switch to soy based, it might help. And try more than one. Better to use breast milk, you might be able to still nurse. If the poop that comes out is hard, then you need to think constipation and should ask your doctor. If it's normal or soft, don't worry about it. Baby (and grown ups) don't need to poop daily.    He's probably not pooping today because he got rid of everything when you gave him the suppository.    And chiropractic is NOT recommended for babies. (Per a chiropractor I worked with.)|`|vt76wtBcaa	i ahve a 8 month old and the first 4 months was this same issue. her dr. said 3 days is the safe   of days to wait. then another suppository...it does get better!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	If in 48 hrs he still hasn't, give him another suppository.|`|am4Vh0SOaa	my daughter used to poop only once a week and have an explosion! I dont think you should be giving a suppository unless your doctor has directed you to...     if you formula feed your baby should poop at least once every three days and the poop should be soft and formed but not hard or watery. If your baby is constipated you will know because when they try to poop they will strain heaps and will poop a hard little pebble...     there are drops you can add to milk that are safer than a suppository...     some things are best left to nature! please consult a doctor before giving anything else...
AA11764194	If you are more than 5 weeks long you can ask.. because before that you won't see anything.. so during very early stages blood work is better to confirm pregnancy..|`|i8Ch743Laa	For pregnancy,most likely not. They like to at least confirm a pregnancy before they do a high test like an ultrasound,that's taking time from their days that could be helping patients that are having trouble with pregnancies and such.|`|DutTBV3caa	im sure you could but i dunno what they'd say.|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. The ultrasound and blood test show different things. Duh. The ultrasound shows the baby, the blood test shows your CBC and whatever else they are looking for.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	No.|`|tg89r7ZJaa	The ultrasound and blood test show different things The ultrasound shows the baby, the blood test shows your CBC and some other stuff.    im not going to like the blood test eather i want my blood to stay in my body and it scares me thinking bout it cuz i hate needles and stuff like that....    good luck gurl....|`|r9gBoBLCaa	For..?|`|4Dc44BC5aa	They always do a blood test, following the positive results about 3 weeks later they do a internal.|`|Xct8kXLsaa	u can but they prob wont give it.|`|UYYe3NfZaa	unfortunately no.  if you are far enough along and are at a good ob office they might do one, but don't bet on it.  most docs wont do it until after 12 weeks.  i don't know where you live but where i live you cant even pay for one without a doctors prescription.  good luck
1pNt9892aa	For my son, it started out around 3 months with a raise bump on his gums where you could vaguely make out something white underneath. As the tooth began to push through, the gums where the tooth was coming in became red and tender. A good thing to do at this stage of the tooth coming in is to soak a cloth in water, ring it out as much as possible, place it in a plastic sandwich bag, and put it in the freezer. When it is frozen, take it out and it makes a great teether that is much more sensitize and soothing to the gums than many of the rubber teethers on the market. When the gums begin to tear for the tooth to come through, particularly with the first few teeth, your daughter will more than likely be miserable. Make sure she is getting plenty to drink as some babies stop drinking as much because their gums are so tender. When the tooth finally breaks through, your baby will more than likely be a happy little camper, and you will be relieved to have your baby back to normal as often teething equates your child to a writhing little ball of misery because their mouths hurt and they don't know how to fix it.|`|7AYnWg3paa	you can see the tooth under the dums...like white lines|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably swelling and tenderness...we haven't crossed that bridge yet, she is teething and drooling like a monkey, but the only one we have actually seen is apparently swollen enough that we can no longer see the tooth|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, my son's looked stretched and white.  But it looked like that for a week or two before the tooth finally popped.  It honestly caught me by surprise.  And the second one did too.  So they can be "teething" forever, but I think the actual big moment of the tooth breaking through is impossible to predict.  The night the first one did he slept through!|`|lGcpXteaaa	My daughters gum looked really red in a certain spot for around 1month. Then the next time i checked her she had a bud :)    She has had two buds for about 2 weeks now and neither have grown fully!|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	Drooling  & chomping down ... but that can go on for a long time before the tooth makes its appearance. Night wakening when she'd normally sleep. Also a hard swollen ridge in the mouth along the gum line that goes from red to white.|`|78c2d087dcd8cfdc713abe3185e0b093aa	It could still be a long time before she even gets a tooth. My son started showing teething signs at 2 months and is now 10 months and just got his first tooth (teeth...he got two at once). Usually there will be a bump in the gums where the tooth will come out. And you could actually see the shape of my sons tooth before it came out, he got his top two first.  Plus the gums may look a little puffy.|`|44a6538785f4c813b7c382028c366213aa	At first it will swell a little bit...then go down and turn whitish...all of my kids had a little black spot but what it was was the tooth pushing through. So when you see that spot, with in a day or two you will see the pearly whites appear slowly but surely. :)
zk3Bp9uNaa	Your about 40% higher risk of getting Listeria while pregnant, but i dont think you need to be too worried.    I admit i have eaten unpasteurized cheese accidently too - and i was fine (even tho i was really worried)  Make sure you tell your OB, but unless you start feeling unwell i dont think you need to stress about getting anitbiotice.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	First off, don't stress yourself too much. I've eaten quite a few things that I shouldn't have (sandwich ham, brie, uncooked egg) without realising it during my pregnancy so far and I'm fine. Listeria is a dangerous problem for pregnant women, but keep in mind that there's no point stressing yourself until you've been to the OB. If you're really concerned I would suggest calling your OB (or even the local GP) and asking what they recommend. Chances are they'll say not to worry about it. It's hard, I know, but try not to panic. You'll most likely be fine.|`|i0sgEZc6aa	im sorry, but ure going to lose your baby, How could you eat blue cheese, even i know that|`|SXS2Gf72aa	omg. Don't worry about it. It was once and it probably wasn't even unpasteurized as they're not even supposed to use that in restaurants.|`|KxBPpzgIaa	dont worry about it it was only once im sure your baby will be fine. my mom also called me and told me not to eat anything with monosodium glutamate aka hydrolyzed vegetable protien and autolyzed yeast extract which is in lots of foods including doritos and soy sauce. they are doing a study and say that this is the leading cause of autism. its scary|`|f2JjoaxVaa	don't stress if it was only a bit than you have nothing to worry about. the recommend you not to eat it in large amounts. if your concerned call your doctor and double check with them other wise i would not stress to much.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Unless you get flu like symptoms  then you're fine.  I ate sushi when I was pregnant (stupid husband took me to this place that has wonderful sushi the day after we found out and I couldn't resist) and no problems.  It's more common in the 3rd trimester.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	I just asked a professional how common listeria is and they said it is very uncommon.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It was just a little and Listeria is EXTREMELY rare so don't beat yourself up. You are probably fine. He won't and SHOULDN'T give you antibiotics if you don't have it.|`|6avKnzkoaa	I honestly think, a one off situation won't do damage. However, better safe than sorry right? See what your doctor says. I wish you the best
AA11763588	Your hormones have to drop to 0 before you can ovulate and get your period again.    You are VERY fertile once you have a miscarriage.    I miscarried on Aug 6th, got my period Sept 8th had a positive HPT on Oct 5th. And I am now 20 weeks pregnant.    Good luck!|`|DD5CMWfkaa	You're supposed to wait 3-6 months before trying for a baby after a miscarriage, because you need to allow time for your body to heal. Generally yes you do ovulate, but you run a higher risk for a second miscarriage when you don't allow enough time for your body to heal.|`|AA11764194	Chances are high as you are more fertile after miscarriage.. but you must give rest to body to recover from previous miscarriage..|`|8Ob9dD2yaa	NO ITS NOT LIKELY TO GET PREGNANT RIGHT  AFTER A MISCARRIAGE BUT IT DID HAPPEN TO MY SIS IN LAW SO GOOD LUCK|`|A5KbJEH1aa	I miscarried at 12 weeks in Feb 08 and let my body rest for a bit becuase thats what the doctors reccomended. I started trying for a baby in April 08 and ended up falling pregnant in May 08, I am now 37 weeks pregnant :)    Just give your body some time to rest and let yourself recover from the loss, becuase i know how hard it is to lose a baby.|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I hope that your doc told you that you are supposed to wait there is a reason for your miscarriage my sister in law had one she had to wait like 2 months your body wasn't ready for the baby so your taking a big risk by trying to have you body take on another baby right away.|`|APgtCPzGaa	I got pregnant just 4 wks after I miscarried, I did'nt think I would but my doctor said it is very common.|`|4g2D2y14aa	Whoa! you didn't even wait to heal, goodness hopefully you are not pregnant yet because you do run the risk of another miscarriage or maybe you were not pregnant at all and you had made believed yourself that you were it does happen.  Give it time to heal then try again
r39EDGhPaa	Maybe you should have..uh..used a condom?    Yes you could be pregnant.  Unprotected sex is for people who want kids.  But by period I assume you mean full-on, not just spotting.  You don't get periods when you're knocked up, but you can spot.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	if u had sex after ur period its a possibility but if not since christmas then no|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You can't be pregnant, if you had your period.|`|y96eYj0Faa	I don't know but I can tell you in 9 months!   Ooooh but there's this new birth control they just came out with and it's 100% effective every time. It's called abstinence.|`|5Mx6IQWxaa	your not pregnant, you had your period after sex.|`|a32638d07cd5df195350b94e7ec64628aa	if you had sex you could pregnant, whether you had your period or not. i had my period and i turned out to be pregnant...the best thing you could do is either take a test at home or go to the doctor.    good luck|`|KxBPpzgIaa	no your not|`|FWxZwSeLaa	No it sounds like your about to have your period again.|`|z5K3d8alaa	Trust me urnot prego because u got ur period!|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Since you sed yuh had yur period in early january then you cnt b pregnant unless you had sex after this & have not had yur period since
1d0efac678a59e5c6098a7e7de1ffa64aa	the same KIND of thing kinda happened to me too, except i wasn't exposed to the juice all that much. take a test if you miss the next period. when girls start having their periods it's usually irregular for a while so that might just be it. if you get the symptoms of pregnancy then definitely take a test, but dont worry yourself because then you'll only make yourself sick and probably have the symptoms like i did, even though i was not pregnant after all.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test or see a doctor. That's the only way to know. Get on birth control to make yourself not worry as much.|`|AA11763588	1st rule, you should learn about your body, how it works, and have a full course of sex ed before you even begin having sex.    On that note. You can take a HPT if you wanted.    Yes, it's normal for your period to be irregular the first year. Perhaps you should look into getting birth control.  1. it will help make you regular  2. you are doing "sexual things" so isn't it better to be safe then sorry?|`|VczgQUETaa	I'm not going to say it's not possible.  Purchase a pregnancy test and go from there.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You know you're pregnant when you get a positive pregnancy test. Go buy one; they're like $10 for two or three.|`|8Ob9dD2yaa	TAKE A HOME PREGNANCY TEST IF IT IS POSITIVE GO SEE A DOCTOR TO BE SURE|`|DutTBV3caa	one-you need to stop all the sexual things you're doing. unless you're a really late bloomer, you're way too young.    two- better take a preggo test and talk to your mother or another older woman who your trust and has gone through this|`|KxBPpzgIaa	lol no you are too young to be doing any of this if you dont know that you have to have SEX to get pregnant|`|Sdpi6KMjaa	Take a test! But I seriously doubt it.|`|94kNwMPdaa	if you havent even had your period for a year you shouldn't even be letting a boy touch you in anyway besides a hug and a peck on the cheek.    oh lordy please save this child before she becomes a mother when she herself is only a baby.|`|SXS2Gf72aa	Oh my gosh. You really need to be educated about this stuff before doing it. You've only had your period for a year.. so you're like 13? 14? That's pretty bad.|`|79eBn6V8aa	You do NOT have to have sex to get pregnant.  You need semen near or in the vagina to get pregnant, SO YES ITS POSSIBLE|`|5UcdeeX8aa	I doubt you are pregnant, I wouldn't even worry but you should be on some form of contraceptive. Even if you and your boyfriend both want to wait, you need to be prepared for "if" that time should ever come.
1z3C0R2Vaa	What are you waiting for take a test good luck............................|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	I would take a test if you haven't had a period since Nov. And if you are normal on a 28 day cycle. ***Baby Dust*** coming your way!|`|MrcbHrKraa	I would definitely take a test =} it couldn't hurt. I hope this is the month for you!! Sticky baby dust!!
5f6XnInEaa	She had 8 live babies, only expecting 7.    They will not tell anyone whether they used fertility treatments or not.    She plans to breastfeed all 8.  Now, with my maths we can work this out.  1 baby on average has 15 minutes each breast. Now let's multiply that by two, assuming she two both at the same time.  Now that's half an hour right there.    Times by four, equals 2 hours of breastfeeding.    what a woman!    No doubt they will have to go public, to be able to afford these babies.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	the deal is that she had octuplets? i'm not sure if thats the correct term or not but she didn't just have 8 kids, They're all brand new babies, all the same age. I saw a news thing that said how many diapers the average baby goes through a year and then how many they'd go through and it was something like 22000.    How can you not think that having 8 babies is a big deal? it has only been done ONCE before and one of them died soon after birth. They were also born 9 weeks early or something, EVERYTHING about the case was amazing!|`|rFtKFp03aa	Im not sure but I think this is only the seconded recorded live birth of octuplets... this is a huge deal!     Its amazing that all babies and mom are doing well..|`|mjlhZAVxaa	She had eight babies, that is what gives.  She pushed and pushed and gave them life!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	???  Who?|`|weA0Xdszaa	She had 8 kids!|`|XOtOMncwaa	Whats the deal? Do you mean why they are making such a big deal about it?     Seriously she gave birth to 8 babies AT THE SAME TIME, enough said.|`|gyoylefvaa	That great. baby a a gift from God.    Be happy for her.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	what do you the deal??? She is one very lucky lady to have all 8 babies healthy and breathing on their own...|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Well she already has 6 kids, and she had ivetro not sure how to spell it.  Her body did not want to have more kids she had her first 6 naturally and wanted more so she got 8 kids.      Good luck to her I could not imagine.  To me six would be enough but when the state in CA pays for everything.  Why not have more kids.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I wonder when they'll get their own show on TLC. I'd imagine it won't be long. It'd probably be in their best interest. Seriously... I can't even imagine how hard it will be take care (and afford) 8 babies! Good luck to them.|`|K8blUjQJaa	That's not a uterus.  It's a clown car.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I think the deal is just that....she gave birth to 8 babies.  Is there any more information that we need to know?|`|pXSKSS3daa	She gave birth to 8 babies.    I'm not sure what your question is, really, is there something specific you want to know about her?
23MPcnNqaa	Yes, they would still be considered twins.  Twins occur when 2 sperm fertilize an egg OR when 1 sperm fertilizes and egg and it splits.  Whether they are born hours apart or minutes apart or even days apart in rare cases, they are still considered twins.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	yes, my friend caitlin was born at 11:58pm and her twin sister cortnie was born at 12:15am the next morning  they are still twins|`|VU4DLpnlaa	twins are twins from the two eggs are fertilised or when the fertilised egg splits, so if ones born 11:59pm and the other 12:01am they are still twins. My brothers were born 5 hours apart like that, one at exactly 11:00pm and the other at exactly 4:00am, weird eh?|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I know a set of twins who are days apart.  It doesn't matter when they are born, what matters is that they shared a womb.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Yes they would still be twins even if they don't have the same birth date.  I watched a show on discovery health where a woman gave birth to twins 10 days apart.  There were complications and the first twin needed to be delivered really early (at like 25 weeks).  The doctor's then stopped her labor to delay the birth of the second twin in hopes of giving him more time to develop in the womb.  They are still twins because they were carried at the same time.|`|ieqLHMq8aa	they actally had this time happen ...but whats weirder is one was born on dec 31 2008 at like 11pm and the other was born jan 1 2009 after midnight.....crazy huh!! they would have different bdays and different birth years.....|`|wFfeayBMaa	Yes of course. Babies can be born days apart and be twins. Twins refers to two babies in the amniotic sac, not what day they are born.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Thats awesome and very rare. They would still be twins.|`|cUfOnldzaa	They would still be twins, but with different birthdays.|`|6lBWoKrgaa	yes the would still be twins, because they are born at the same birth period.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	um, yes they would be twins still, just have a diff bday....why wouldn't they be twins?|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes, they are still twins. They were born from the same pregnancy so being born on different days doesn't change the fact that they are twins.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	What makes them twins is the fact that they shared a womb.  The actual time of birth is irrelevant.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	They will still be twins.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Twins have been days apart due to medical issues with one that caused it to have to be delivered. The other baby them staying in closer to term. Twins are two babies carried at the same time. Some one that splits are identical and two eggs are fraternal.  Birth dates have nothing to do with it.|`|rFtKFp03aa	They are twins because of they were conceived at the same time and carried by their mother at the same time who gave birth to them at the nearly the same time..     There were twins born on  new years eve and new years day this last new years holiday.. different month day and year for their birth.. they are still twins....|`|NxNrZksXaa	yes they will still be twins because they will still be born practically at the same time.|`|cv0foxlTaa	Yes, they would still be twins.  What makes them twins isn't that they're born on the same day or not.|`|rymbwVKXaa	it happens all the time. It doesn't matter one way or another, just  when they get older the older one can harass the younger one.
TL6c0Ntcaa	You have an IUD which can cause the type of bleeding that you are experiencing. You have not indicated when the IUD was inserted and what type it is. You sound like you have had a close to normal menstrual cycle. If in doubt, please consult your doctor if you feel that this is abnormal and if you are experiencing any pain or discomfort.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Period.|`|NxNrZksXaa	it sounds like it could be implantation. wait until the end of the week or until monday and take an HPT in the morning. if you don't want to do that or don't trust the results then go to the doctor and get a blood test done. that is the most reliable result.|`|Boubyng3aa	It could have been implantation bleeding, but i wouldn't get my hopes, because there is a chance its not. If you were supposed to get your period tomorrow, the you can take a test and see, if you are pregnant then it should show on a test now. Best of luck
AA12075640	Most definitely.  One thing to think about is the type of birth control pill you're on.  Meaning, if it's a combination of hormones you may be safe if you've only missed 3 days/doses.  The pill with only one hormone (progesterone only) leaves the blood stream/body sooner.  The second type leaves you unprotected after missing even 1 dose.  It has to be taken at the same time everyday, without fail!!!  (I found this out the hard way)  Anyway, I would wait the two weeks as suggested then take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You run a higher risk yes. I would use condoms for the next few weeks and not take your pill just in case you are. You can test after 2 weeks.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yeah theres a high chance, how many days does it normally take from when you stop taking your pill until your period starts?  if its 3 days then id think about taking the morning after pill if its been 72 hours or less|`|NxNrZksXaa	yes you can still become pregnant|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	YES!!  The pill isnt 100% effective when taken properly (i concieved on the pill)    Always use a back up method if your not ready for a baby!|`|47R03TbFaa	YES YOU CAN GET PREGNANT AND SINCE YOU FOR GOT TO TAKE YOUR PILL FOR THREE DAYS YOU ARE AT RISK OF BEING PREGNANT|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss|`|iE6Ol2i1aa	Yes, you could very well be pregnant. I have forgotten for 2 days before but I was luckily not pregnant. It is different with everyone. Best to take a test in two weeks to make sure.|`|FWxZwSeLaa	Yeah you could be. I would wait and see if you get a period if not take a test and if positive go get a blood test to be sure.
pX9DDdOEaa	i take birth control , and yes , when you get down to the last row (the different colored ones) is when you should start your period . You dont have to wait till next month to start taking it , You can take them whenever .        Hope this helps you out .  .I was a little lost when i first started taking them .|`|47eiwyMLaa	I found that starting the pill closest to your period works best. The pill is a series of hormones, similar to what your body produces. You want to work with your body to keep your cycles regular.    If I were you, and you don't have to be on the pill this month, wait until your next period to start it that following Sunday. In the meantime, if you're sexually active, please use a condom and/or spermicide. You'll need to continue using another form of contraception until after your first full month on the pill anyways...meaning the next 6-7 weeks.|`|jBIaUfUzaa	Never take them when ever!!!!!     you take your birth control after the last day of your natural period !!!!!!!!! then you take birth control every day for 23 days !!!!! an the dark green pills are placebo's or sugar pills you take when your birth control induces a period there should be 7 for a 28 day cycle
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Her body is going through strange things, her emotions are running wild. she very well could be scared knowing she will be responsible for another life. Like the others said, you are lucky that she even wants you around. I couldn't stand anyone to touch me! Give her your love. She needs you to be strong for her.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	You are lucky. I won't even let my man touch me. I want to bash his face in when I see him. Live it up!|`|db0b210c80d4e4ffe387d7e20319c906aa	Just give her your attention. Both of you will have the baby to cling to soon.|`|fBsfuYqEaa	lol , pregnant women get very emotional .  she just wants to be assured you'll help her because she is close to being due & she's maybe worried that when she does need you, you wont be there on time. So just comfort her & try to keep her happy because depression is unhealthy for pregnancy .|`|rl1IITqRaa	lol awwww. i was like that for a while, and i'll probably get that way again before the pregnancy is through! it's a hard to explain feeling women get when they're pregnant...verrrrrry sensitive and needy and emotional. i felt lonely very easily, i felt very unattractive. hug her a lot (i know that's what i wanted the most from my fiance when i was feeling that way), and when you're at work call her when you get the opportunity so she knows you're thinking of her.    good luck with ur baby. =)|`|MSfC0FXvaa	its not her fault. she just wants you there for her and make sure you're not leaving her. especially since shes so far along and gonna pop any moment, she REALLY wants to make sure you're there. her hormones are going crazy. im the same way. im really clingy with my boyfriend. and im only 24 weeks. i think its just the emotional attatchment. :) be there. and dont be mean. good luck. :) and congrats!
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey am so sorry for your loss x  Your chances are good, there may be a possibility as tiredness is one of the first early signs because your body is going through so much.  I would take a pregnancy test and see what the outcome is, if no results then have a blood test done by the doctors ase these are more accurate and detect low levels of hcg if your body is taking a while to do this.    Best of luck xx
4268d61bf5ff452e0f18883391534252aa	No , that's not possible . U may be a she-male but u don have the reproductive organ that a female has . A ovary is what u need . So , u can only inseminate another female but not urself . Even in another guy have sex with u , u also wont be able to be pregnant .|`|4dXcZhuTaa	that's a really good question for a really good doctor.  good luck!!    hopefully, your body can sustain it.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	No.  I don't think you can get pregnant but you can get a girl pregnant with your male parts.
AA11763588	Get a HPT and if it says yes then tell him. Don't assume you are pregnant until you know for sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I don't know what the first thing is. You didn't say what it is that you think she's feeling higher up in her tummy. I've been pregnant twice and in early pregnancy there was no pregnancy symptoms to be felt in the upper tummy area....that's not pregnancy related I'm thinking. Gas could just be gas and cramping is common in the weeks before your period so...that might not be anything either.    Have her take a test.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	signs are different for everyone so i think your friend should take a home pregnany test before she tells the father coz she could just be getting close to her period. Wait and see if she misses her next period and if she does get her to do a test.  Good luck!!|`|7xit1ogxaa	If your friend thinks she is pregnant then she should take a pregnancy test. I'm not exactly sure what you are saying the symptom is, maybe a gassy feeling in your upper stomach? That isn't really a sign of pregnancy.|`|47R03TbFaa	YES IT IS THE EARLY SIGNS OF PREGNANCY AND CONGRATULATIONS .. BUT A CUTE WAY TO TELL THE DADDY TO BE HE IS GOING TO BE A DADDY PLACE THE POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST IN A CARD AND GIVE IT TO HIM BUT MAKE SURE THE CARD HAS DADDY ON IT BUT THE BEST PART IS MAKE THE CARD YOUR SELF ON A COMPUTER OR BY HAND AND TELL HIM DADDY I'M BAKING MY LOVE FOR YOU AND WHEN I'M READY YOU WILL SEE MY LOVE FOR YOU|`|UaL28atDaa	Im not sure about a cute way to tell the father but if you want to be really sure take a home test. Also take a look at this video it has lots of information you will find useful :)    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|PhkLLwVbaa	Before telling the father she should take a test but yes cramping is a very normal sign and being extremely tired like needing a nap at some point in the day nausea is not always a sign not every woman gets nausea or in the 1st trimester that will depend on her.|`|i1WpKYKHaa	I took serious what was poked at me in fun.  Lol.  I really did do that.  I said it to my father too but he went ashen and almost passed out.|`|AA11762804	buy a "I love my daddy" bib and wrap it up and give it to him on valentines day    I had felt like that before i found out i was pregnant
zk3Bp9uNaa	Yes - the pill isnt 100% effective so there is always a chance  But you are "covered" while on the sugar pills|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. On birth control you should be able to have unprotected sex all the way through the pack. You are protected.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	yes.
9490cc31e63b3e2949a248e69bacf006aa	It's normal it's because since the doctor had put a tube up you it's because he scrape you it's normal it's the cells it happens to every pregnant women|`|QJDbG1F1aa	A brown discharge is not considered normal. I would seek medical help.|`|AA11763588	I'd call my DR. Green/Brown/Red discharge usually means infection.
cWP73qEsaa	i had this problem with my son also. his head actually came out sideways through the birth canal (yeah ouch) what i did was i breast fed him more on the side he didnt look to or bottle fed him that way also and i change his position in the crib like if he looks the other way switch him because he will more likely look for you and put something black and white in his range of view to catch his attention no too close though just to avoid any danger. dont worry it will go away soon if it lasts after the 3 to 4 months and you are still concerned check with the pediatrician. hope i helped a bit good luck.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	My preemie did that too! Everything you described, she did and still does at 4 months... although, it's less and less now.     I think once they are more aware of their surroundings and more curious about the world around them, they quit doing it.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	My son wouldnt look left - i moved all his pram and cot toys to the left side and put him on his belly more often and stood or dangled things on his left - now he looks both ways fine.  they will grow out of it.|`|aT7HgLJnaa	It could be Torticollis. Talk to your baby's doctor about it because if it is than you'll want to treat it now before it gets worse.|`|AA11637178	Babies see shapes. Nothing is really clear. And he has not learned his name. His right seams to be his dominate side. If he really favors his right side on his next check up talk to the doctor.|`|q4yfbhODaa	Are both you and your son's father right handed? I ask this cause i had this problem with my son and it was because my husband and I are both right handed and we always held the baby the same way in our left arm and held the bottle with the right. My ped told me to switch arms every other feeding and to massage his neck. Ask your sons ped first about how to massage him before you start. My son is going on 8 months now and all is fine. Hope this helps!|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	My baby was the same way and around the same time. I believe his neck wasn't strong enough for him to turn but now he turns it every where and he started doing it at 3 1/2 now he will be 5 months next week|`|u9sGH0AXaa	Mine does the same thing. The bad thing about that is the possibility of "flat head" on the right side.  Try positioning him differently or putting a rolled up blanket under his right hip so he will look to the other side.
1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	Yes it can be considered child abuse if you leave marks, use an object to hit your child with, such as a belt, or if you spank out of anger/frustration. I worked for CPS for 5 years and it's not against the law to spank your child but there is definitely a fine line between spanking and abuse. As far as I am concerned you shouldn't spank your kids. Look at it this way... you probably (hopefully) don't hit your friends or your spouse when they do something wrong, so why would you hit your precious child? Sometimes, and this happened while I worked at CPS, a parent slapped their child across the mouth for back-talking and the parent's ring left a mark on the child and it became a court case. Also, some parents will grab their child's ears...one parent ripped the child's ear and even though they didn't mean for it to happen the child was removed from that home temporarily. Just don't spank your child and you won't have to worry about this.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	As far as i know here in australia it is not considered child abuse.  If i have to spank, or smack is what we call it here in oz - it would be with an open hand on my sons bum - but seeing as though he is only 7 months old - he wont be smacked.    I got smacked as a child, and i wouldn't say i am a victim of child abuse - it was a quick and affective way of getting the point across when all other avenues failed.  Despite what the bleeding hearts on here say, smacking - if done short quick open hander on the bum - does not hurt, it might sting but it just jolts the child into reality and stops them from doing what they shouldnt be doing.    Using jug cords, sticks, paddles and fists is abuse.|`|XT3uyW5kaa	Spanking is only abuse if it leaves a whelp or bruise.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Child abuse (physical), by law, is defined as leaving a mark for 24 hours or more.    So spanking is not abuse. But if a parent leaves a bruise or a scratch or cut or something that lasts for a day or more, than it can be considered abuse.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes and no. it all depends on why you spanked them. and if you were angry then no its not ok to hit a kid when you are mad?|`|r07BwhO1aa	No spanking is not abuse regardless of what the anti spanking Nazi's on here say.    Spanking if done and used correctly can be a very effective tool in raising a child.  There are guidelines that each parent should follow when spanking and they vary from parent to parent but are just about the same, here are my personal guidelines:    1. Never spank when angry.  2. Never with anything other than your hand.  3. Never more than 5 times.  4. Never anywhere other than the butt.      Spanking becomes abuse when the parent can not control themselves and cause injury to children, spanking is not meant to injure a child, it is to re-enforce a lesson.    It is NOT against the law to spank your child, it is against the law to leave marks, or break the skin or hit your child excessively.    My personal opinion is that parents who do not know the difference between spanking and abuse should not spank their children.  Like I said before spanking should be used to re-enforce lessons that other methods (i.e. time outs, punishments) are no longer working to stop.|`|0JBXD87uaa	If you leave a mark, it's too much. My parents spanked me (pants on!) and my bottom was red for a few minutes, but that was all and it got the message across just fine. I am a well adjusted college student now and I'm glad my parents had the guts to discipline me.
APgtCPzGaa	Towards the end they run out of room, so no more somersaults  .But they will continue to kick and squirm, if your baby has not moved at all then call the doctor,.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Towards the end you won't feel as movement as much cause there isn't a whole lot of room in there especially after they drop. You only have to worry when you haven't felt the little guy in 24 hours.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Could just be not much room left for him to move around. However, from all the books you get, they say that movement don't stop because of labor. However, I'm sure your little one is fine. If you're at all concerned go in to see your doctor. I'm sure they'll check him out for you =]|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Yes it is normal for the baby to stop moving before pregnancy. And yes they do drop, it's to prepare for birth.|`|627pWyVkaa	Ask your doctor would be my bet. But It could just be because your so far along now he/she does not have as much room to move around in your tummy!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	yup...when they get into position they run out of room. You should still feel baby though, if you are not at all, have a big glass of water and lay on your side. If you dont feel baby in like 20-30 min call your Dr. (but dont panic:)|`|PhkLLwVbaa	As a precaution I would call an advice nurse but you sound ok i'm 30 weeks with my second pregnancy its a bit harder for them to move around once they have dropped into the canal if your baby has dropped.|`|79eBn6V8aa	Most likely everything is perfectly fine.  The baby is packed in there really tightly now and cannot move about as freely as he/she once did.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	they do move less, because there is less room... but if you don't feel your baby move for 24 hours, go to the hospital (that's what i was told to do)    38 weeks.|`|AA12373051	they usually do stop moving alot. no room|`|KKxX5wszaa	Yes, to me t sounds normal.  The baby usually drops and settles down when it comes time to birth.  Though you wouldn't want to be so sure about this.  Every time you have a concern or uneasy feeling about anything that's happening during pregnancy; you should go talk to your doctor about it.  So, go talk to your doctor, ask him about all the side effects, or things that are going to be happening. Rather be safe than sorry, plus you don't have anything to lose. Though just to reassure you, you sound perfectly healthy! I hope that I helped! By the way, congratulations on your baby! Good luck on being a mother and raising a beautiful child!|`|AA12075640	Those who answered less room to move are correct.  Also, what I used to do was to nudge them a little.  Usually they will nudge back.  It doesn't hurt them and it'll give you a little peace of mind.  You can do this as often as you like.  Be prepared for him/her to nudge you a little more than you expect.  Don't do it close to bed time or you might have trouble going to sleep.  Lastly, for some women, eating/drinking something sweet will get him/her going, too.      One more thing:  You're the mom.  If you feel something isn't right, have it checked out.    Good Luck!
vOFdHvlvaa	Neither, a name doesn't make a person, and all the Alexander's and James' i know are very nice peeps and aren't punks at all and so yea, lol.|`|Elxuvon8aa	what is you definition of punk   James known all his life as Jimmy for me|`|we0xPfYLaa	Well thats a good way of thinking about names but I would say Alexander is.

I love the nick name Xan which comes from aleXANder|`|N5EhfDX2aa	JAMES HANDS DOWN! its a nicer name though. I hate the name Alexander, its so wimpy!
wZAeBisbaa	I think this is an issue you need to resolve before you get married.  There really is no middle ground.  It might help to figure out just why he is so against having another child.  If he is already supporting three, he must be donating a good share of his income already. It would be understandable if he had financial concerns.  But if that's the issue, maybe you could agree to wait until you are both in a position to support another child before considering having one.   If the reason is not financial, then there must be some other strong feelings involved.  Whether it's fear of not having enough love or enough energy or just a desire to do other things with his life, each of these could be addressed and worked around.  But you have to be willing to work through his feelings and yours.  If that's not possible, this may not be the man you want to spend the rest of your life with.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	it's not about you or him being "punished."  you just want different things.  plenty of parents of three kids feel that they don't want any more, and it's no more his fault that he had children before meeting you than it is yours that you didn't.      you can discuss it and you can determine if anyone's willing to compromise.  but ultimately the parent who is sure he doesn't want children needs to win, because it's not fair to a child to have a parent who doesn't want them (and it wouldn't be so great for the other parent either to be raising a child with a partner who was full of resentment).      since you say that he's your fiance, i'd work out this issue before getting married.  whether or not to have children can be a marriage deal-breaker, and if it's going to be, then better before the wedding than after.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Don't punish him if he doesn't want anymore. Be happy with the one you have together and if you can't be happy with that find another guy it isn't fair to him if he doesn't want another one. He isn't punishing you. Also he isn't telling you that he has loved too much. Be happy you have the one together and you have 2 step kids.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	To be honest, you KNEW he had two kids when you guys got together so you would only be punishing yourself.    If he doesn't want anymore kids, then it is pretty clear cut.You cannot force him to have anymore.He isn't telling you he cannot love anymore, he just doesn't want anymore.He has a financial duty to three kids already along with loving three kids.    That is a lot.One more might be too much for him.Wait a few years and he might change his mind.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Only if he just discovered this.  Otherwise, you knew what you were getting into.|`|d5K8wORqaa	just try 4 2 more kids  take hormones in secret  dont go on the pill etc|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Hard answer.    You will have to choose.  You can't "make" him want another child.  Its not punishment. Its simply the way it is.    If you want another child more than him, than break the engagement.    But don't deceive him by "accidentally" having another child.  Women who do that rarely are happy with the outcome.      Good luck...truly.|`|NxNrZksXaa	no you shouldn't  be punished for that because you had nothing to do with what he did in his previous relationship. i think you need to just wait it out and gradually keep talking about it and hope that he will come around. if he really cares then he will see how much you want another one and will probably give it another try.    good luck!|`|3b0iEteqaa	You aren't being "punished" by anyone.  He doesn't want anymore children--believe and honor his wishes.  If you want more children and he does not--you need to move on.|`|9X09kM4oaa	You need to tell him you want more and he needs to be open to that idea. You are a family, and families love,grow, learn, trust, and build.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	With today's harsh economy, do you blame him? Don't assume what you think he is telling you. Sit down and have it out.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	You entered a relationship with him knowing that he had two children.  Both partners need to feel like they have a voice in the issue since both partners are going to responsible for raising or providing financial support.  Respect his decision or at least wait awhile before bringing it up again.|`|bTLFOlynaa	Hi!    How did he feel before you two were engaged? The reason why I'm asking is because when my husband and I were still dating we discussed children. It was important to me to know his feelings on this before we became serious.     Did he ever mention how many children he wanted, and possibly how many with you?  If he did and you knew this was his limit, you can't really get upset with him. But if you never discussed this then this could also pose a problem, like you are facing now where you want more and he does not. Tell him how important having more children is for you. If he doesn't want anymore, just be happy with the one you have now, its your little miracle and he may change his mind in the future! Good luck to you!|`|VygBNA0Waa	i here you   i have one child with him and he has two children to his ex we have full custody of them though   and he says no more children to me as well  i think its unfair that he has 3kiz and i have one   but im coming to terms with it now   i hope you get what you want   its better to have one and a husband then to have two kiz and no husband|`|CVA86LY6aa	Tell him how you feel! Its not fair to you!!!! You should be able to have more kids. Tell him that you feel like YOUR being punished from his past indiscretions. Tell him HE may have 3 but YOU only have one, and you want one more.    good luck|`|AA10925330	I understand your need for another child. But I do want to warn you, if you convince him to do what you want, and he really doesn't want another child, you could be in for trouble. A friend of mine did that, and her husband left after they had the second child. And he warned her, he could not handle another child. But she did not listen. Now, maybe a truly nice guy, would have dealt with it. But all I know, is she pushed the issued, to get her way, and now she's without him and a single mother of two children. So just be careful what you're asking him to do. He might really be telling you the truth. Sometimes you have to sit back and be happy for what you have, instead of worrying about what you don't have.
CD5JsjxKaa	i used to have irregular periods...but they sorted themselves out over time. i found that stress had a huge impact and i found when i relaxed more and actively destressed i'd get my periods at least every month. maybe you should try that.     i talked to a doctor and he told me that there's nothing to worry about and that i will be able to get pregnant no problem. but even still, i worry too. i would suggest you see a doctor about it. ask them what else you can do to make your periods more consistent and whether that has any affect on your chances of getting pregnant.     baby dust to you and me both!!|`|pX9DDdOEaa	i have kind of the same problem as you , i have irregular periods and i do take birthcontrol , so i heard that if you take the birthcontrol untill you have a period and then once you have your period , dont take them and it usually takes 2 weeks after your period to ovualte , so chances are pretty good for you to get pregnant .       This is some advice that i have just gotten .
cm87ujQ1aa	Im pretty sure u have or are dropping,i get all those symptoms now im 40 weeks pregnant and 3 days over due......but yeh as i get up out of bed in the morning with out fail there goes a pop in between my legs!! Sooo loud !! I also get a tonne of like pulling pressure down there too....anyway congrats!|`|82PkTDwwaa	Sounds great! Your well on the way to being a mum. Sounds like baby is engaged and getting ready for a look at the outside world, in baby's own time of course. Hope all goes well, congrats!!|`|01vMpHkWaa	i just recently had those symptoms and yesterday looked into the mirror and CLEARLY see i had dropped    so im pretty sure your dropping  keep an eye out when looking in the mirror|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Baby is on the way....congratulations!!!  You should see the Dr soon...
mFQydvncaa	def a possiblilty i think shes needs plan b asap or you may  have a baby!|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Yes. One shot contains approx. 40 billion sperm. So, I suggest recommended she take Plan B immediately or be prepared for a phone call in a month or two.  I lied to you:     Fun Facts About Semen    The average volume of ejaculate is around a half-teaspoon.   A load of ejaculate contains 40 million to 600 million sperm.   http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/s...|`|n1D90COxaa	yes, anything is possible.|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	She could be, it only takes one sperm.  Just don't eat this kid k. :)|`|52U22fiAaa	yes.|`|39bCq7ncaa	To me it sounds like your only bragging that you got laid, and you supposedly made a girl climax|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	congrats Daddy......................................|`|YVd79cbraa	yeah.|`|f2JjoaxVaa	yep!! good luck!|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	i think if you and her are both worried the only thing you can do to make the worrys go away is to take  test if her period is late. and yes it only takes one sperm to get a woman pregnant. there are millions of sperm in each drop.      Sperm can live for up to 5 days after being released, and can 'wait around' for an egg in order to impregnate it.
pX9DDdOEaa	Ok , so you had sex the day before you ovulated ? chances are high that you are pregnant , after you ovulate the egg lives up to 24 hours , and sperm can live up to 72 hours (3 days after he came in you) so yes , you more than likely are .       Your best bet would make an appointment and go for a blood test here soon . But i would wait it out for a while .|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	If you had sex while  or around ovulation time, chances are pretty good you are preggo. especially if your temp is elevated. Take a test as soon as you miss your period! Until then have fun imagining that you are pregnant, at least if it is neg you will have had a good time thinking that maybe you were. And if you really are then even better!!!!! baby dust!|`|8D6IbrcTaa	Yes it does sound like you're pregnant.  There are some HPT that you can take 4 days before your period is due.  Try it, or you could just wait and see.  Good luck|`|9yP43Peiaa	You need to get a test but it sounds like you are pregnant. It takes days after sex to become pregnant and the day before ovulation it a good time to have sex.|`|3Se5nlJtaa	Wishing you lots of luck to start off. It is possible that you could be pregnant. My husband and I have been ttc for a year and a half. Up until about a three months ago we have not really be working super hard on it but wanting it. I never had noticed that my breast do get tender but I noticed when it was something that I really did want.
um29wkUPaa	How come the onset of puking is always at 3am?  How come they go out to jump in mud puddles the same day I wash the floors?    How do they not know instinctively that skiboarding down a flight of stairs on a collapsed cardboard box is a bad idea?  Who is "not me" and why does he keep getting toothpaste all over the bathroom mirror.  How is Everyday-Math any better than New-Math?  How was New-Math any better than Math?    Also, having nothing to do with parenting, I'd like to know how come people duck under helicopter blades when they're moving but stand tall when they're not.  They don't go lower or anything do they?

DAruN0GYaa	yes there is a lot of truth to losing weight while breastfeeding, however eat healthy and plenty of exercise helps as well.  The first few days will help you tighten up a lot, even though it will hurt, massage your belly for the first few days as the nurses should show you to do to help you uterus shrink back to normal.    Breastfeeding is hard though and I would advise learn as much as you can and listen to the nurses and breast feeding assistants there.    + go grab some lanolin while you are at it (helps with cracked or dry nipples), plenty of breast pads too =D|`|c05f49b3f4c027d416f383d20cd2f813aa	oh yes...breastfeeding does miracles! at the end of my pregnancy i weighed 192 pounds ( i am only 5'3) i gained 40 pounds in total. now, my son is 3 1/2 months old i have lost 43 pounds already...and u will mos tlikley get food cravings.. still... the rbeasfeeding makes u pretty hungry.|`|nhJfeh3Qaa	Yes and no.  I never breast fed, and I lost my weight just as quick as I put it on.  I have friends who breast fed and lost weight quickly, and others who didn't.  Keep in mind that it takes 9 months to put the weight on, and it takes about a year to be back to normal.  I was in maternity clothes only a couple months.      Don't be ashamed though.  Some girls are able to bounce right back into there size 2 jeans the same day they give birth, while others cant until after several months.  It all depends on your body, which needs plenty of time to heal.  Breast feeding is great to burn calories from what I hear.  Good luck!|`|s5xzW3g5aa	I wore my maternity clothes all the way through to my next pregnancy 2 years later.   But with my second I am able to breastfeed and I am losing the weight way faster than my first and all my maternity clothes are to big.  Breastfeeding totally does make you lose weight faster it also has tons of other benefits to the mother but obviously more to the baby.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I've lost most of mine and my daughter is two weeks old, I was back in my pre-pregnancy clothing when she was 5 days old (my weight gain was quite small).

But it'll be about one month! I've heard so many people say that that's a myth, you don't really lose weight breastfeeding.... but I did!! I still had an INSANE (and still do) appetite, and I lost all my weight (expect for that last ten I can't get off!) in about 2 months.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	Girl Breastfeed I regret that I stopped it did slim me down and it maintained, then when I stopped I gained back a little as far as maternity clothing it depends how much you gained and lost each person is different because I was breastfeeding it took a week  to get back in some of my old clothes but then again I didn't gain alot either Good Luck|`|W3LhnYTwaa	I wore my maternity clothes home from the hospital only because that is what I came in.  There is absolutely no reason to be in maternity clothes after you child is born.  I guess I am different in that I only gained "baby weight".  I did breast feed both my kids but it had nothing to do with other weight gain.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	zero days...believe it or not, immediately after giving birth, i weighed 40 pounds less than i did right *before* conceiving...yeah, i was a chunker, lol - and therefore had developed gestational diabetes - but i stuck to the diet very well so that i wouldn't put my baby at risk or require insulin shots....edit:  i had a *tiny* "pooch", but that went away within a month, no lie - as i continued to stay on the diet.    i've heard that same thing about breast feeding, though....and apparently, it's TRUE! -     "Moms who breastfeed will burn significantly more calories on a daily basis than moms who do not breastfeed. This also helps the uterus constrict and become smaller faster. So, breastfeeding moms will find they lose weight quicker and some say the weight just melts off."     http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/h...    good luck and congrats! :)|`|eryJKCpfaa	They say you burn 500 calories just from breastfreeding in a day. You just can't eat an extra 500 calories in one day because that would defeat the whole purpose. i plan on breast feeding the first 6mo, and i will get my bod back i hope with in the first month!!|`|5xM0XuJdaa	I was in maternity clothes about 2 weeks but i had a c-section so you swell. I also heard that you do lose weight because you burn a lot of calories. I went down a pant size after I lost all the swelling and I breast feed.|`|weA0Xdszaa	I just got out of them, 3 months later. And body's not fully back to normal... :( but heh, it took 9 months to get that way, they say expect it to take as long to get back to normal.

And she's breast feeding and she lost her postpartum belly fast, but she had gained a lot of weight in her legs and hips and that's mostly why it took longer for her to get back in the regular clothes. Hope this helps!!  :)|`|vjK8ZT20aa	After having a baby in '06, '07, and '08 I came home from the hospital on a friday and had my maternity clothes packed up and heading to the resale shop by Monday.  Of course my clothes were still snug and I have since even gained a little more of it back but within two weeks I was back down to my pre baby weight and I didn't breast feed.  I only gained 7 lbs during my pregnancy and wound up weighing less after delivery.  It just evened out when my baby was about two weeks old.|`|PymLdXM8aa	yeah there is truth to that because it burns fat when your body makes milk. Also my daughter is 7.5 mths old and i still do not fit into most of my clothes... so yeah. But also my maternity pants are to big on me so im in the weird in between stage i guess....|`|pjgMW6qaaa	My tummy isn't as firm as before pregnancy :( but I fit in my pre pregnancy clothes.    I looked 4 months pregnant till like a week post partum. I breast fed for 3 months.    I lost the 21 lbs I gained plus 5 more in about 6 weeks or less.    Breast feeding is good for baby and you.    Good luck!|`|0VUZacRTaa	i wasnt in maternity clothes at all. i breastfeed and lost a large majority of my weight in a week
Roui5iT5aa	I have 9 month old identical twins and everyone gets them mixed up,  the only way we tell the boys apart is one has an inny and the other has an outy bellybutton, when they were born we just put an anklet on each to tell them apart.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	My cousin has twins and I don't think she has ever mixed them up but sometimes she has to look at them for a minute to figure out which one is which :) One has a little bit more hair than the other, one has a little bit of longer face than the other and of course personality wise they are different. Early on she put a dot of fingernail polish on the bottom of one of their feet just to be sure.    I cannot personally tell them apart at all. Whenever I see them I try to guess "This one is....uhhhhh...... Devin?" and I am usually wrong!
Fx77zYhWaa	Depends on the disease.  If you get HIV you just take the drugs they give you and it really lowers the chance that you'll pass it on to the baby.    If it's gonorrhea or Chlamydia  (OMG I spelled it right without spell check!!  Go me!) then as long as you treat it quickly with antibiotics the baby will be fine.  If not then it can cause pre-term labor, blindness, or even death.    Hepatitis B then they will just give the baby the shot once he/she is born and he/she should be fine.    If it's Syphilis as long as you get antibiotics before the 16th week the baby won't get it.  After that it is more likely he/she will be born with it.    Herpes can be past to the baby if there is an active outbreak and a vaginal delivery.|`|AA10186411	Diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea will not affect the child as long as it is caught in time.  The mucus plug prevents this.  But blood diseases such as syphillis and HIV can be contracted by the baby quite quickly.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Yes, It can be passed on to the child.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	yes if a women has a STD HIV/AIDS and pregnant she can pass it though her unborn child|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Yes, it could. Research the disease you (or whoever) could have contracted.  For example, diseases like herpes could affect the baby's face if delivered vaginally (though doctors wouldn't risk that; you would have a c-section). I'm sure syphilis could affect the baby too, since it's able to spread all over the body after it's aquired.|`|DKfScL8taa	It depends.... I have HPV since before I got pregnant, and that has not affected my baby.|`|eryJKCpfaa	Yes, it depends upon what kind of std and how long it has been left untreated.|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	Your baby will be born but it will be dead|`|99MYd45Xaa	Some do and some don't.    You could pass these diseases to your child, which is sad, because they have no chance to prevent it.    It all depends on which one.|`|wzjL2itMaa	This is what my Dr. told me when she questioned me if I had any diseases at my first visit. I didn't LOL. It depends on the disease. If its herpes even if there is an outbreak I believe they give you meds before delivery so it isnt passed on to the baby.|`|3hQDfdwYaa	I had a std when i was pregnant but it didn't effect my baby at all cause i  got treated early. It also depends on what type of std you got|`|sIxdlaxqaa	u can only give the std 2 the child if u do the vaginal birth. so i suggest u have a c-section instead, then the child wouldn't get the std.
cJ1hizgHaa	It sounds like your son has IED: Intermittent Explosive Disorder    Where when an individual is sufficiently provoked they will result in  physical violent manner|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Don't give him the attention. That's why he is doing it because he gets attention from it. When he acts out ignore him. Play with your girls. Don't let him be the first one to get the drink. You have gave into what he has wanted for too long.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Maybe he has ADHD, or maybe he has some kind of imbalance which makes him more aggressive. Talk to his pediatrician about it, he\she might have a suggestion as to what the cause and solution might be to this problem. It's tough with young children, because they cannot articulate what the problem is so I think getting the opinion of an expert is helpful.|`|AA10925330	It's hard to tell how much he's acting up. But a lot of what you're saying sounds like it's because he's a boy. I have an only child, who's a boy. And he's so competitive. It's just in their nature. And since you have two other girls, it's hard for you to understand why he's not acting like them. But they really are two different species. My friends with daughters, do not deal with the things I deal with. So although, you don't want your child to be mean to his sisters, you also don't want him to be punished for being a boy. So try to understand what is a boy thing, and how to curb his behavior so it's nice, while not taking away his boy nature.
mFZeEm9paa	I believe it is 20 weeks, and yes the babies in the womb are alive by definition. They have a heartbeat and they can feel the pain, of their limb for limb getting sucked into a tube, and they are screaming and trying to get away from the vacuum thing the entire time. It is sad the people who are naive enough to think different just so they can feel good about getting one. That is a huge issue to disagree on. Obviously I am on your side!|`|AA10186411	In the US, it is 24 weeks without a medical reason.  But many doctors these days will make up one just to be able to do it.      I personally think you should reconsider being with him.  I could not date someone who has that attitude.  Its not about opinions, its about right and wrong.  Someone who thinks its ok to kill a baby (or fetus if you like it better that way) obviously has no heart.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Simply for convenience purposes?  24 weeks in most places.  I think its something like 16 or 18 weeks in other places, but don't quote me on that part of it.  Most abortions are performed prior to 16 weeks.    A late-term abortion can be performed all the way up to 40+ weeks for medical reasons.  They are very rare though.  A child would have to be so severely sick and malformed that they wouldn't be able to live outside the mothers body.  In this day and age of technology and medical miracles, there's no real need for them though.  I honestly can't think of any reason why one would be necessary.  They exist of course, I just can't think of any right now.  After 24 weeks, the baby could potentially survive on its own, so the mother could deliver if it was needed to save her own life and medical intervention could be given to the baby to try and save its life.  No need to abort.    With just a teeny bit of research, he'd be able to educate himself a LOT more.  He's obviously just not educated on the topic.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	not after obama lifted the restrictions  some places can go up to 9 months now|`|sFPV2KbBaa	i had severe medical complications and had to have one done.  i was 6 and a half months.  at 6 months of term, a fetus is viable.  meaning that it can survive on its own with some help.  that was 7 years ago, not sure what is the legal " to term" for theraputics right now.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	24 weeeeeeks? OMFG ..thats EVIL!!!
PeoOb4aHaa	I think it looks like hives too.  Did you use soap in her bath?  Sometimes the same old soap you've always depended on can turn on you.  I have to use Burt's Bees, Dr Bronner's and California Baby soaps on my kids.  They get hives just like this.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	My niece got those after a bath sometimes, and when we took her to the ER the second time it happened, turned out it was the soap, but she wasn't allergic, it just caused the splotches and then they'd disappear. They're harmless, but we didn't know that until we went to the ER. They actually kinda acted like we were idiots, but it was my sisters first and I don't have any kids of my own, so we didn't know and I figure better safe than sorry. If she is sick, I don't think the splotches have anything to do with it. I would monitor her temperature though... that is a bit high for a baby.     On a different note though, she is just adorable!!! She looks very happy.  :)|`|5rNwCItBaa	they look like the same thing my first child had, i rushed her to the hospital and was just told that its a baby's body's way of helping get rid of illness from the body.      On saying that, it never hurts to go see a doctor if you're not sure, that's what they get paid for after all :)|`|LbkLg4RFaa	It may have been a reaction to something in the bath or because of her illness.  Babies can often get rashes when they have had a fever.  Also I know when my son or I have had rashes they often appear worse after having a warm bath or just from being hot.  Just like you've said it is settling down now.  Don't be too alarmed if at her next bath it appears red again.  Keep an eye on her and if it seems to be bothering her or gets any worse it doesn't hurt to have her checked out for piece of mind.|`|tnKqIgyWaa	I dont think its hives, they are usually raised more than that, it dosent look life threatening or anything I would guess food allergy, my daughter got something similar on her face from ranch dressing. I would say watch it till morning then if it isnt gone call her doctor|`|CcjMd0PSaa	It looks like Roseola, starts with a high temp, runny nose and the baby being irritable, once the temp goes down after 2-3 days the rash will come out.  My son has it at the moment and the rash looks the same i took him to the doctor but they don't do anything for it they just have to ride it out.  Hope this helps|`|VClxXNs3aa	I agree with the second poster... it looks like allergic reaction but maybe a contact allergy.    did you use the same tub as usual, the same soap? clean her tub recently?  have you changed laundry detergent or fabric softener lately?  use a new lotion on her or on yourself then touch her?.... all things to think about.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	They look like hives from an allergic reaction.  Call the advise nurse.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	they look like hives.  maybe the bath soap you used?  have you changed it lately?  are you using new laundry soap?  my daughter breaks out from Huggies wipes & Luvs diapers.  i would take her to an acute care or ER just to be safe.  you just never know.  it could be one of the new foods too.    she's adorable, btw.  you could also call your pediatrician.  they may have use give her liquid benadryl.  that's what my daughter had to have when she broke out in a similar rash.  i think it was the laundry soap we used...it's been a long time, though.  good luck.|`|43JgLpkKaa	it could be a reaction to the foods .. but i would say it is something else. i advise you to take her to the doctor. she may need an antibiotic.|`|WwCBomTMaa	There are a few different things it could be. An allergy to something, did the baby touch something that might have caused it? What soap was used in the bath? Or it could be a disease called fifth's disease. It isn't very common, but it is harmless. It usually happen's sometime around the baby's 5th month (hence the name). My daughter had it and she looked horrible!! Poor thing. Does your baby act like it bothers her?You might want to speak to a couple of different doctors. The first 2 I talked to said that my daughter was allergic to my cat, but after I made sure the cat stayed outside and that she wasn't exposed to cat hair she still didn't get better. It took the third doctor to realize that it was fifth's disease and instantly wrote a prescription for her.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	It looks like an allergic reaction to something. It's possible that it could be from the food, but it could be from something else also, since they only showed up right after her bath. Did you use the same soap/shampoo on her that you always do? Did you use any chemicals to clean the tub out yesterday or today before she was put in the tub that may not have gotten completely washed away? It doesn't look like anything serious and it doesn't look like something that would come from the water being too hot. Odds are if the water was too hot then she would have started screaming or crying when you put her in the tub and that would have clued you in that something wasn't right with the bath water. She looks like she's pretty happy in the picture. If it's hives then they will go away on their own. It can take up to 24 hours for a food allergy to react in an infant, that's why they tell you to slowly introduce the foods and give them 24-48 hours before introducing another food. My son had an allergic reaction to cranberries and got a rash similar to that on his body almost 24 hours later. I have also accidently made my children's bath water too hot (I felt the temp of course and it felt fine to me or else I wouldn't have put them in), and they let me know right away that it was too hot by crying and reaching for me and the spot on their body where the water touched was red but not patchy like a rash (I did pull them out immediately when they started crying and reaching because I knew something wasn't right). Your baby is adorable by the way!|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	Was she laying on anything while you were bathing her? Could it have been something you cleaned the surface with? I wouldn't say it would be the sweet potatoes. It could very well be heat related, but you would know if it was hot enough to make marks like that...she would prob scream! Just keep and eye on her throughout the night to make sure her breathing and such are ok! If she begins to run high fever, bring her to the ER. First thing in the morning, call the doc for an appt. Any other signs of distress?    EDIT - It shouldn't, but it could be coincidental that it suddenly broke out in the water. But that really leads me to believe it was bath related in some way, detergent, cleaning supplies, soap, towel, hot water, etc.|`|2YfnzbRnaa	it seems like hives to me... you have to take her to the er because if she allergic to any food or fruits that same rash could appear in her lungs causing her breathing restriction...|`|YVd79cbraa	it looks like the bath water was too hot.  they sell these little ducks at walmart and target and other baby stores that you can place in the bathtub before you put the baby in to see if the water is too hot. you should probably invest in one of those (they are like $4) since you like your water hot.  if she is having difficulty breathing or you notice any swelling of any part of her body then you should go to the ER immediately.  but they say that you can never be too safe.  especially with babies that cant tell you what is wrong themselves.  ((she is adorable by the way))|`|AA11637178	Is the bumps water filled. If it is then she might have the chicken pox's. But some babies get rashes from a fever. And fevers from teething. Or for no reason at all. Mine had 103 for no reason at all. If your still really worried in the morning call the doctor(or if they are water filled bumps)

o9nSygbEaa	Usually you have to take out all piercings before any surgery, including a c-section. Belly ring has to be taken out because, well, they're cutting in the area and want it as clean and sterile as possible. Tongue rings needs to be taken out because, if they need to intubate, the tube can get in the way. They generally want earrings out because if they ahve to monitor PsO2 (amount of oxygen in your blood) they can attach the probe to your ear lobe.     Having said that, when I had my c-section it was an emergency c-section and there was no tiem for even thinking about jewlery. I had general anesthesia and they managed to intubate me with my bar still in my tongue. I'm sure the anesthesiologist was cussing while he was putting the tube in, but he did manage.|`|AA11764194	Usually patient needs to remove all his/her jewelry during operation because of sterile purpose.. and C section is a major surgery.. so it is part of procedure..    if you don't want to remove just tell them, nurse wl cover the particular jewelery with plaster..|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Yes...you take out all jewellry for hygienic reasons....|`|dn2UCOkqaa	No|`|LiPoEBenaa	A c-section is considered a surgical procedure and the doctors and staff have to make sure that it is a safe, sterile environment. I'm not sure about a natural birth, but I would assume you could keep the ones in your ears in.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes don't think it is safe rem is your belly button.|`|Gr78AFvyaa	aahh I hope that's not true is it? I have a nostril piercing that is going to take wire cutters to get out....its literally stuck in there because its one of the twisty ones without a back... I haven't heard of this before! I can understand belly because your getting your tummy cut open and tongue piercing I could understand because if you were to seize or something you could possibly choke on your tounge ring...|`|f2JjoaxVaa	belly of course because that is were they are cutting with a c-section. my friend has her ear nose and tongue pieced and never had to take them out. i had a natural birth and have my tongue and ears pieced and never had to take them out. the only reason ive heard of you having to take out a tongue piecing is because you are going under fully. c- section they give you an epidural or a spinal which its only the lower half of your body that cant be moved.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	i've multiple surgeries  (never a c section) and always had all my piercings in, they've told me to remove tthem, so i guess it all depends on your doctor|`|y7vxGDyTaa	there no reason to take out the ear piercing though they might have to do it so if anything does happen they cant be blamed for it. and for the nostril yes because it may get in the way of you breathing.
UUpsa35Daa	He doesn't have to have a specific reasoning for worrying about this. Anybody in their right mind would worry about getting pregnant or getting someone pregnant if you had unprotected sex.    Just after you find out for sure, tell him so you can put his mind at ease.    Then stop being so irresponsible and use protection. I don't know if either of you are ready to be parents but i'm willing to bet no, otherwise...he wouldn't be so nervous.|`|AA10186411	Guess what!  The pull-out method does NOT work.

1uyhFsFsaa	it would depend on what they had done if it was something that put them in danger or affected an innocent persons life then i would like to think i would. i know the argument " but he is your child how could you do it"  but at the end of the day that is not how he has been raised, he knows the difference between right and wrong and also knows if you do wrong then you pay the consequences.  sometimes you would have to be cruel to be kind if they commit an unspeakable act then they need punishment to show them how wrong they are.   if you did not turn him in what are you telling him? that is ok to do as he pleases and the rules don't apply to him? how could you call yourself a good parent if you done that?  you done the right thing and whilst some people will condemn you for it there are a lot of people on your side you have to tell yourself that he was the one committed the act and not you. you are not responsible for that and it is always your job to steer him in the right direction   it is the most difficult choice any parent has to make and you done great you have put his long term needs first he will thank you eventually when he realises what he done was wrong and he can't do it.  you don't say what he did but knowing how hard that choice is to make i trust you that it needed to be done, you put his welfare first whether he understands that or not   well done in being a real parent and not brushing the problem under the carpet as some would only for their child to do something much worse in the future cause they have had their parents blessing.  just because they are our children does not mean we condone all their actions|`|4gZYucHMaa	I wish my mom had done that at the time instead of defending him and further hampening things by stealing money for his bail--using my college money to repay the courts back.

Unless they turned out like Casey Anthony.    Something minor? No. But don't ever tell them that....|`|0cCZkuBOaa	It depends what your child did. For example, if your child shoplifted, go back with him/her to return it and make him apoligize. If that doesn't work, I saw a YouTube video of a mother who would embarass her children as punishment (They would write on a bristol board the thing that they did wrong and hold it up and stand out in the sidewalk [I dont know if thats against the law in any way =P]). However, if your child killed someone, definitely they should go to prison.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Depends on just how wrong what they did was.  If they physically hurt someone else, YES.  If they had pot, no.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	No I wouldn't. But that's why I will probably never actually be a mother... id be a bad one who spoiled their kids.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes I would. I watched my parents cover up things and get my brother out of trouble over and over. He never learned from his mistakes and he never learned that there are consequences. He is 38 years old now and still a drug addict and still a criminal. He is in and out of prison and has been for the past 20 some years. He has even stolen from them and they still cover for him. They talk about him like he walks on water. My children have been taught right from wrong and I believe in consequences. If they do it, they are going to pay for it.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	I will do everything in my power to raise my child to prevent something like that...    but honestly...I don't think I could give her up. Something minor of course to teach her a lesson...but other than that, I just couldn't.    EDIT - Diane..I give you your props..you are much stronger than I am.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	It depends on what she did.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	It would really depend on the situation and the child.  If doing it would help the child get on the right track, then yes I sure would. Being a parent sometimes means making heartbreaking decisions - but sometimes it's necessary.|`|AA11514493	As my father told me..  "I will always love you, but I don't HAVE to like you."  Now taken without the rest of the explanation/conversation it may sound cold...but bottom line is..  I was taught right from wrong, as I taught my boys. If I messed up, I would pay the price.  Yes, I would call the police..but I would do everything I could to help them through whatever was done.    "You are responsible for your own actions."|`|QyyCnPBDaa	There is a difference between kids just being kids, and a genuine danger to society. i would only involve the police if what my kid did caused substantial physical harm to someone. otherwise, my policy is to not involve the police if it can be solved by other means. i have made my kid work all summer to pay off damage done to a neighbor's yard by partying, but never involved the police per an agreement with my neigbor. Pranks, hazing, vandalism,k fighting and other rebellious things are in most cases just what's done as a certain type of child.

Don't create a monster by allowing them to skip away from the reality of their choices for ill.    If your child has done wrong, they need to accept the consequences.    To shield them from the consequences of their actions may seem to be a good thing, but it can teach them that the rules of our society don't apply to them.    It is far better for them to learn that while you DO love them, you also expect them to be adult and responsible even when the choices they make require them to pay a price that may be unpleasant for everyone.    A little temporary discomfort and inconvenience is far better than a lifetime of grief over repetitive bad choices.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	yes.if i can't handle the situation after i beat them down lol.and hopefully one day they will forgive and thank me for doing so. i probably save their life or someone else. so mom don't feel bad you're not alone in asking this.yes i know it's hard but it could be worse.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	only if he/she killed someone   or violated a child  or raped anyone

e8yt5PrGaa	Hey bro ..at 14 you need 8 hours of sleep ..so if you can be at school by 8 then it should be 11.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	All of my kids go to bed at nine. The oldest is 14. He has to get up early for school (6 am) and needs his rest. You need to develop good sleep habits early. My son is usually so tired by that time that I don't hear a complaint, sometimes he's in bed earlier than 9.     Yes, I think you should have a bed time. Yes, I think your bed time is reasonable for your age.     Now listen to your mother and get off the computer. :)|`|IA5zVfk0aa	thats the time my brother goes to sleep.|`|AA12221392	my 14 year old  has to be in bed at 10:00 pm, his 9 year old sister - 9pm    MY 17 year old daughter - 11 pm- she is usually in bed at 10:30 though    You are a child and need to have rules and that includes bedtime, which I see you aren't following the rules because it is pass your bed time now..  If I was your parents if you gave me hassle I would reduce your time by 30 minutes each time you complained about it or diobeyed and was on the computer    Good nite|`|rRceaE4Maa	Heyy. I'm 14 too! I don't have a bedtime! I usually go to bed around 10:30pm or 11pm though! I can't wait to get in bed because I'm always bushed :) Anyways, I'm usually up late studying though and my mom knows that, even though she wants to make sure I get enough sleep, she trusts that I'm up for a good reason! So hope I helped ya!|`|yW3RYLRDaa	Well,  since your 14, you have to deal with higher level school that is of more importance than a child in say, 3rd grade.    I have to get off the computer at 10, and have to have lights out by 10:30.  But i usually go to sleep before that, and even then, im tired when I wake up.    Choosing your own bedtime may seem great and all that, but it's really not. And soon, you'll be thankful that your mother set it at 10 for you. Trust me.|`|a5BhsLeQaa	10:00 is fine.  My 14 year old goes to bed at 9:30. Now get off the computer and go to bed!!|`|YFMaRxaWaa	to be honest you're 14 i don't think you need a certain bedtome unless you don't get up on time for school.but too each his own.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I think for 14...10 or 10:30 is reasonable actually. It's the 8 year old that should have a bit of a sooner bedtime.    Believe me, you need your sleep. I grew up with the bad habit of sleeping only 3 or 4 hours and, while it didn't affect grades or how i worked, i had to work extra hard to fight through how tired i was feeling. I was dragging a lot of the time and it just took a lot out of me to keep up. You'll be thankful that you get a full night's worth of sleep.
7C9Ett7Caa	I think your husband will embrace your bump. I dont think it will turn him off.. I know how you feel about the whole "feeling the babies head" thing. My doctor said he could feel the head also. When me and my boyfriend had sex the night the doctor told me that, It didnt feel any different, my boyfriend said the same. My doctor said that theres no way a penis can hurt the babies head. When my doctor told me he can feel the head, the first thing I asked him was "Is sex still safe". He said yes. After the baby comes, there wont be much time for sex, so embrace your beautiful pregnant body, and make love to husband while you still have the time, lol. Good Luck!! Just relax, Im sure it will be just fine..|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Well just take it easy, no swinging from the chandeliers :)   I dont think he can feel the baby and the baby is still protected by the cervix and uterus so the baby will be just fine.   I doubt your bumb will turn him off, most men seem to find pregnant women even more sexy.   The best position that worked for us that far along was having him laying behind me ( both on our sides). Me on top was too exhausting, me on the bottom just unpractical and 'doggy' one was really painful for me, so try that one :)  have fun|`|zATQaiwIaa	if your doctor didnt tell you that sex was out of the question you should be fine; as its been 2 months though - i would tell your guy to take it easy and find a position that is comfortable for you.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Some women feel that way...it happens...u aren't strange at all.  He probably won't feel anything.    Enjoy reconnecting while u can!|`|52U22fiAaa	You'll be OK as long as you don't think about it too much.  However, if the baby's head is on your mind while doing the deed, then you might not enjoy yourself.  No harm will come to baby unless your doctor said otherwise.      Oh, and your bump won't turn him off :)|`|Gr78AFvyaa	Some men get very very turned on by pregnant women. Its natural and if he loves you im sure he will find your bump (and your new full breasts) sexy.   Your baby won't have any idea whats going on...and as for your partner? most women are TIGHTER when they are pregnant due to the increase of blood flow. Intercouse is good for you at this point!!   Yes its normal to feel this way, you have a lot of new hormones your dealing with and your body has gone through drastic changes.  ....look up pregnant lingere to maybe make yourself feel better. quit with the self consciousness, I am sure you are just as beautiful if not more beautiful as the day that you got pregnant.|`|irGE84Qdaa	i had sex with my husband even though the baby dropped the head nothing bad happen just u have to keep it slow don't have to be wild.|`|LABC73E7aa	well since u dont have sex in your cervix him or the baby wont feel anything. and he will think ur beautiful!|`|cm87ujQ1aa	It is totally normal to! Im now 40 weeks pregnant,and am totally fed up feeling very ugly....but my partner says he thinks my tummy is beautiful,even though it has some nice stretch marks! haha.  As for sex,it may be uncomfortable 4 u....it is 4 me. Not doing it again until way after baby is born! It can also bring on labour if ur bodys ready 4 it....especially if he ejaculates inside you.  Anyway good luck !|`|YVd79cbraa	my cousin is 7 1/2 months pregnant and she has only had sex once with her husband since getting pregnant because she says she can feel the baby moving and going crazy whenever they have sex.  a lot of people have sex up until they deliver, its just depends on how you feel about it.  i don't know if the baby can feel anything.  i would think so, but im not a doctor.  call your doctor and talk to her about it.
mFQydvncaa	yes my first child!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	yessssss|`|Spm9Raz9aa	my sister. they used the "pull out" method. does not work!!!|`|NxNrZksXaa	yes i know of some people who have gotten pregnant off of that, so yes it's possible!|`|s3WdcVknaa	yes my best friends gf got pregnant|`|627pWyVkaa	yes I have! and i was a virgin so Dont do it honestly its just as high chance of getting pregnant if the guy cums in a girl|`|eryJKCpfaa	They say you can! My husband and i used the pull out method for 4 years and i never got pregnant. When we started ttc, the first time he came in me, i got pregnant! The chances of getting prego on precum is low. I read that there is only 2% of sperm that is actually in precum, But all you need is one little guy to get you pregnant!|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Nope but it can happen|`|nhJfeh3Qaa	2 out of 3 of my pregnancies were a "pre-***/withdrawal" babies.|`|i1WpKYKHaa	Yeah, with my third.  Advice, if you don't want a baby keep it covered.  Birth control is a joke.  I had my first two with the pill, and I took them religiously.  And if you go for a round two, make sure he washes with soap.|`|mLbydsVIaa	i got pregnant from that...  i thought if he pulled out in time i wouldnt get prego...but theres always pre-cu.m! and i was stupid not to beleive it..its ok though..i dont regret my little princess.|`|tu3WIhtKaa	Yes. Me! My husband and I have been using the "pull and pray" method since we got married in 2006. It worked really well for us for over 2 years, because we never had accidents and if we had intercourse for an extended period of time (longer than 10 mins) we'd use a condom. I do not recommend this if you are not married and not prepared to get pregnant!  All of my married girlfriends who did not want to be on an OC, used this method and it worked pretty well for them.    BUT...      I accidentally got pregnant in 2008 and it may have been due to a little accident, but not even close to a full internal spermination.  So, yes, it's possible to get pregs from pre-***, especially if you were out celebrating all night and your man might not have the same control when "pulling out". : )But at any rate, we are thrilled to have this baby, and if you don't think you are ready, don't chance it. Get on Birth Control!
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	you could just leave it in your breast, its easier.     but any ole bottle will do, my baby liked the playtex drop in ones|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Any kind of bottle works! The best kind of nipples suggested for breastfed babies are the Playtex nipples that come with the drop-ins system. That's the only bottle my daughter will take.    Storage of the milk can be done in storage bags or tightly sealed bottles. Most pumps come with bottles for storage.|`|Z67HkDKCaa	You can put it in a regular bottle but if you're going to freeze or heat that bottle - make sure its BPA free.|`|9PqAOQu1aa	I put mine in regular bottles. I keep up to four-five at a time in the refrigerator.  If I have more than that, I freeze it in a storage bag.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	it doesn't matter|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	My daughter never accepted breast milk from a bottle.  She just won't take it that way.  It has to come straight from the tap with her.  All babies are different so some might take it from the bottle.|`|KWelUnSOaa	you can put it in any kind of bottle|`|zATQaiwIaa	what ever bottle system works for you and your baby - it goes in any of them!|`|jkFZb2aYaa	the bottle itself does not matter...but to avoid nipple confusion, you may want to look for a nipple that is most like breast.  I found the playtex drop in liner system bottle to be the best...they have the wide nipple that my baby loved and helped avoid nipple confusion.  He would only use the regular nipples...no silicone nipples.  Good luck!|`|3hIr3Dllaa	any kind of bottle, but put it in a storage bag if you're freezing it|`|0VUZacRTaa	i put it in regular bottles
dTLTNZTzaa	Do you breastfeed or formula feed your newborn. If it is formula - probably you 'll have to change it for something different- for sensitive stomach. If you are breastfeeding - look into your diet, or go for formula - it is possible your baby does not like your milk.   For the newborns it is normal to eat every 2-3 hours about 2-4 oz of formula. I would go with Similac Alimentum - it is on a pricey side, but worth every penny. If that one does not work go for Similac Sensitive RS - for babies with spit up problem. I am pretty sure Enfamil has similar products plus it is covered by WIC program, but I am writing from the experience - my baby would not eat Enfamil, that is why I am recommending Similac.   Check with your doctor anytime you switch formula. You want to make sure  your baby is gaining weight. If baby wants to eat more often and less amount - don't be afraid - it is normal, but try to work out schedule - less headache later. Plus try to change baby's diaper before feeding time - after eating put the baby to sleep - they get sleepy. (don't forget to burp - very important)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	vomiting and spitting up are entirely different; if he is vomiting of course he needs to be seen by a doc  if he is spitting up excessively, he also needs to see a doc..  just let him cry? NO  GET HIM TO A DOCTOR ASAP, not only can he easily get dehydrated, he's apparently not keeping enough down to feel like he has eaten...  why have you not seen a doc already? what are you waiting for?|`|pXSKSS3daa	No, that is not normal.    Does he have a fever? If it's higher than 100 degrees he needs to be seen by a doctor ASAP. Also, if he's not having more than 6 wet diapers in an 24 hour period then he's becoming dehydrated. I'd get into contact with his doctor if possible. If not you should at least call a nurse hotline and see what they suggest. With him being so young and vomiting so frequently they may tell you to bring him to get him checked out.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I would talk to your doctor about changing his formula. My 14 mth old was a "cranky" baby and we finally ended up using Similiac Sensitive as his formula, but he is still a 'cranky" baby, he just stopped spitting up!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	how often are you feeding ? and is he going to the bathroom? he may be colic  . you may call his doctor|`|Z67HkDKCaa	Sounds like acid reflux.. take him to the pediatrician and get some pedatric zantac - it tastes terrible to baby - peppermint but it helps a lot. My son had the same issue and is better. Hang in there! But go tomorrow am!|`|qyObFvz6aa	Is it spitting up or projectile vomiting? If it's not projectile he could be experiencing reflux. My baby had a mild case of it at one month. She was always cranky because she was hungry but knew that eating would bring her pain. Does he cry in the middle of a feeding? Does he cry when he's hungry but refuse the bottle? Does he sound phlegmy after a feeding? Those are some signs of reflux.  Or it could be a cow's milk allergy. Call your doctor to diagnose and find out what you can do to ease his discomfort.  Projectile vomiting could be a sign of something more serious. Hope all goes well!|`|8D6IbrcTaa	Call you dr|`|oJzMFaxuaa	maybe you're overfeeding him?  he may throw up cuz he's too full then hes fussy cuz he's hungry again?  Just a thought!  Congrats on your baby boy!|`|XfHqIc0Oaa	call the doctor immediately!!!!    their is a stomach bug going around in my area so he may just have that but he definately needs to be checked ASAP|`|AA11637178	He needs to see the doctor ASAP|`|i1WpKYKHaa	Call your doctor, but try not to worry, it could be something as simple as changing the feeding regiment.    Good luck.
9X09kM4oaa	well you need to try a different avenue to sleep... try drinking some hot milk or hot tea with no caffiene... if that doesn;t work try unisom which is over the counter and has no pain relief in it it just helps you sleep, and if that doesnt help go to your doctor to be prescribed to a sleep aid like lunesta or ambian. good luck.|`|oJzMFaxuaa	lol.  I'm assuming that you just had a child and you're taking care of the baby at night so that's why you can't sleep.  Not only do they wake you up every 2-3 hours but you're forever worrying about every little thing that could go wrong with your little one while they're quietly sleeping.
reO9Dgmsaa	It is a combination of hormonal changes and increased blood flow.  :)    http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/pregdisc...|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	You have an increased blood flow to your pelvic region and this can cause an increase in discharge. Your blood volume almost doubles by the end of your pregnancy.|`|Bi37YWm6aa	The white/clear discharge is an increase of white blood cells, says my doctor.|`|7XuzvSlYaa	What I've read is this...  The discharge is the vagina's way of keeping itself and the birth canal clean and free of infection.
NxNrZksXaa	make a youtube of something that you are good at doing (besides brushing your teeth. lol), or something that you enjoy doing, such as:  *drawing  *painting  *singing  *dancing  *redecorating something in the house  *making something (crafts, clothings,)  *doing somebody's or your hair  *playing an instrument  *cooking  *friends dancing  *doing a skit  *a day in the life of you  *a favorite school program/activity coming up    hope this helped|`|cY8DgJv5aa	If its something that you really are "in to", then ideas will just naturally come to you.  Get your friends involved if you want to.  Make some funny skits or lip sync to songs.  That's probably the most common videos that people make.  Or you can simply blog about silly, fun, interesting things that happen in your everyday life.|`|JKKR67M9aa	WHEN U R READING THIS DONT STOP OR SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN!

Haha yeah that was my comment...LMAO
8rjMKkjIaa	I would suggest u wait for atleast 40 days and then take a test|`|akZ97froaa	Just wait a little while longer and then take a test. If you start getting symptoms also take a test.|`|JMj8HSaVaa	wait another week then take the test....
iAGzyzRWaa	I would throw out the bottle, and instead of boiling the bottles they make microwave sterilizers they work wonders and you really don't have to worry about melting bottles hope this helps|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i would throw it out|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Melting plastic = unhealthy.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I wouldnt use it..

5xM0XuJdaa	I have had an ectopic back in may and i just found out that I am pregnant. Mine was also on my right side and every now and then my right incision does have twinges of pain and itch. I would just call your doc's office and just ask as a general question about it.     good luck, I am hoping that this one is not ectopic.|`|cTneu6uMaa	i had my appendix taken out may 29 and found out i am pregnant in august at that time i was 4 weeks and i still get pain because they pulled it out through my belly button and as you start to stretch maybe the incisions on the inside didnt heal as fast as the outer i too still have a little pain
ed766aacc26b258767da06e39783b5fdaa	I don't know if there is a really good way to know for sure..I asked my doctor's office the same thing when my little baby had RSV, they told me she may still be contagious for a couple weeks, and not a good idea to bring her around other kids while she was still coughing and having a runny nose. I understand where you are coming from. You hate to think that you may expose other little ones to sickness, especially RSV which can become serious with some kids.   Just ignore ignorant people like donotbuyakia. You are obviously a very caring and considerate mother for thinking this through and considering other opinions before sending your little one back to day care. If every other parent was as thoughtful as you maybe these diseases wouldn't run quite as rampant in our daycares.|`|9iDhKZ1Oaa	My son got it at 4 mos old and the ped told us it was EXTREMELY contagious. It is a very dangerous (can be life-threatening) disease. I wouldn't send your little one back to day care until SHE feels better, and that's just for her sake. I remember my son was miserable when he had RSV and just wanted to be near me while he was sick. As far as the other kids getting it, I would wait until your daughter has finished taking all of her antibiotics before sending her back to day care.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	my son had rsv when he was 4 months old.  he had to be hospitalized and i was told it was very contagious.  the medical staff looked like they wore astronaut garb coming into our room (face shields, gloves, etc.).  this was 7 yrs. ago so not sure if they have learned anything new...but it is a very dangerous virus that can be life threatning to babies.|`|Vf0bmaVGaa	Your doctor maybe totally right, but he maybe wrong. Doctors are people too! My brother is a doctor and my father is a science professor and I still would not agree with them unless I totally understood their answers. Your doctor may have given you an answer but he didn't explain his answer satisfactorily. It isn't that you don't trust your doctor it is that you don't understand if your child will infect another person's child. I would call your doctors office and pose that question to the nurse. She will find the answer for you. Your doctor and his/her staff don't want you to be so worried over something that you shouldn't be. They want you to have full knowledge of why they release her medically.     Now if their answers don't agree with the facts that you know then ask for clarification, like "I thought that this ...." then they can have a chance to explain their answer. Don't let them push you out the door until you are satisfied. If it is really important to you then get your answers and the explanation you need. I wish you well.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	So you're saying that you trust the advice of total strangers with no medical training more than you trust your child's pediatrician?  You either need to be getting a different pediatrician or your child needs to be getting a different mother.  He spent at least 8 years in medical school.  He knows whether it is safe for your child to be around other children.
XOtOMncwaa	It does get easier... but I'm not going to lie, theres always something new.. it seems like when my son was finally sleeping all night he was napping less during the day time... just when I got used to him sitting he was crawling, when I adjusted to him crawling now he's running, I'm starting to get used to the walking and now he can reach things he couldn't reach before so now I'm having to re-baby proof my house... but I wouldn't go back to the sleepless nights with an infant for anything. I dint think it ever gets easier honestly, you just learn to cope better, 7 weeks isn't enough time to totally adjust to a new baby, I find some days my son it so out of control from the moment he wakes up, and I rarely even notice it now, I mean of course I notice it and take care of him, but it doesn't bother me as much as it did when he was little. It gets easier when you adjust, and I don't think it was easier by 8 weeks, more like maybe 4 months? That's when I really started to get the hang of things... Trust me you will be in the swing of things before you know it, I do things sometimes with my son that amazes me... and I can handle situations now that I would have broke down with when he was first born... Hang in there, it will get better. My son had colic, gas problems and acid reflux... so there were many nights where I just laid there and cried with him!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	it gets easier, hang in there|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Yes, it really does get easier.  There are still always going to be challenges, but many babies start sleeping for 4 or more hours around 8-12 weeks.  The end of the hourly waking is in sight.  Hang in there and be strong.  You're doing a great job!|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I think it depends on the baby.  My girl is 8 weeks old and she's never really been a crier or had anything wrong with her tummy.  Getting up at night is the only pitfall (most of the time it's every hour to and hour and a half), though the last 2 nights since she's turned 8 weeks it has been 2-3 hours!  There's a glimmer of hope. :)  Good luck.  Just think, this too shall pass and you will miss when they were little enough to fit in your arms.  At least that's what I can imagine as I am a first time mommy.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I promise you,  it does get easier.  It depends on the baby as to when...  the first four months was the hardest for us.  After DS hit 6 months it got even easier.|`|gxlEqdclaa	Yes its true and it does get easier. I really feel for you. That used to be me once. I now have a 3 year old girl and sometimes i can't even remember what she was like when she was a baby. Your little man will grow up so quickly so cherish those baby moments, even though they suck at the moment.|`|AA11637178	Honey he has you trained really well. LOL It will get better. Try not picking him up all the time at night. Try letting him lay there and you pat him and see what happens.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	weeks for 4 to 8 are the worst and it gets a thousand times better after 12|`|9iDhKZ1Oaa	It does get easier, and I vaguely remember what you are going through. I was having a tough time like you are. My son is now 7 months old and it's hard for me to remember when things were tough (well, they are still tough, but in totally different ways!). My son had stomach issues and it seemed like NOTHING worked. I tried Mylicon, Gripe Water (that did help a little though) and switching formulas 4 or 5 times before things started to get a little better.  I know this sounds ridiculous because right now I am sure you are just praying for this stage to be over with, but don't wish it away. They grow so very fast... you just don't know. Just hold her as much as you can and love her and kiss and cuddle her. You won't be able to do it for very much longer.|`|Lnpqs5lHaa	I know this doesnt really answer your question.. but the mylicon drops have been on recall.. heres the link    http://safemama.com/?s=mylicon+drops    I remember i was soo stressed the first couple days because my baby would wake up every hour of the night. It had to do with her not being full. I cant remember when it got easier. Its been soo long. I use to hold her to sleep too & continuing holding her when she slept. It was the only way i got sleep.
PymLdXM8aa	I dont believe that there is a certain amount your allowed to have, that sounds silly... but of course with each one you have have more scar tissue which can cause its own problems during pregnancy and delivery. Also the only way that you are for sure going to have to have a second c section is if you just cant deliver normally due to health issued... or if you had a previous c section with a vertical cut. If you have a horizontal cut then you can have a VBAC ( vaginal birth after cesarean). I know this because i had a c section adn my doctor reassured me many times that i can have a natural delivery next time ( my daughter was breached by the way). Also they have used to horizontal incision for quite a while now.. my fiances youngest sister is 12 and his mother had a c section with her and she said that she has a horizontal incision also.|`|uxl2P2CBaa	Personally I have had 143. I really enjoy them.|`|nhJfeh3Qaa	I am not 100% certain, but I believe it depends on your past history and your body.  Some women can only have c-sections and it doesn't matter how many children they have.|`|ZI0scBdJaa	they say 3. but im not sure. its really not healthy to have  alot because you build up alot of scar tissue.. and it gets  harder to have one as you keep getting them|`|5xM0XuJdaa	I heard that it was like three or four. I believe that it is the doctors preference. My sister had her baby in a completely different hospital and different doctors and they won't allow vaginal after c-section and mine will. So i believe that it is the hospital and doctors policy|`|6qgIXITSaa	you can have many..but a lot of stretch marks too.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	If you're pregnant, the baby has to come out somehow, and if you've had a C-section for one, you normally have to have one for the next and so on. I don't think there's a maximum number.|`|eryJKCpfaa	i heard 3|`|24P6A0oaaa	pretty sure you can have as many as necessary... maybe google it...I will be having my 2nd soon, it's weird  thinking they re open that scar.|`|CZwJJetyaa	Anything after 2 holds a possible risk. But it varies from woman to woman. Depending how you head and how elastic you skin and uterus are. I would ask my OB/GYN what he would recommend for you.
PlmT4lHXaa	Yes, I don't think asking for $5-10 is unreasonable. You are in college, so naturally you are going to need some money.. college kids are poor by nature, lol. Jobs are hard to find, and even if you do there isn't much time to work between class, studying, and sports.|`|44uorNhOaa	no i wouldnt. u seem young how old r u?|`|EMKuBql8aa	No.....she is 19 and technically an adult. A Make up kit is not a necessity.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I would always help my child get what they need, no matter what their age is.  Pre-wrap and tape might be considered a need.  A make-up applicator kit is not.|`|AA10620879	It depends on what it is. I have had two teenagers living at home who we have helped. One is moved out and we are still helping her. The other is about to move out. As long as they are working and paying their bills we will always be here to help them in time of real need.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	I would have no problem helping out my 19 year old while he/she is in school.  Although, since you have enough money for the pre-wrap and tape, I think you should buy it yourself and wait on the make up applicator.  You need to get your priorities in order first, then ask your parents for help if you truely need it.|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes of course i would help as much as i possible can|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I think since you are 19 you know which one should come before the other, the pre-wrap and tape is something you need. I also think you are old enough to do some chores and get paid for doing them since you can not find a job to buy your wants.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	If I knew you were really trying to get a job and could not find one then yes I would help out here and there...just make you do some  extra chores for me in return lol|`|ZHea5z0Gaa	You buy the pre-wrap and tape because that's the responsible thing to do.  Then explain that you spent the X_MAS money on such and ask for the 11 for the make-up.  Parents can accept the repsonsible part and respond better.|`|r00oHbqlaa	no once ur 18 ur out.|`|7b360b8c3b7d104a9aa0913a1859d4e4aa	A 19 year old should probably have a job to take care of such things...|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I'd trade a 19-year-old college student the money for shoveling snow or raking leaves or doing that week's errands or doing other chores outside her normal responsibilities.    it's hard to imagine a 19-year-old with only $11, though.  i'd also probably suggest she do some babysitting or get a part-time job in her off hours.  19 is a legal adult, and though college should be a priority, a certain amount of supporting yourself is reasonable at that age.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I think I could help my daughter out with $10 for some tape for soccer, yes--but I would expect that my 19 year old daughter who lives with me would have a job while she is waiting to get into the Police Academy.  Has my 19 year old daughter even been accepted?  Has she even applied?      When I was 19, I had a job--even while in college--so I had some spending money and money for my incidentals.  My parents were paying for my college and room and board in the dorm... but anything extra I needed I tried my best to pay for myself.  If I came up short--they helped me--but they knew I was doing my best to pay my own way for those things. I would have hated to have had to nickel-and-dime myself over small inconsequential purchases like that.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I would ask you what was more important...a make up applicator tool kit or pre-wrap and tape.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Probably not...  Why buy the makeup aplicator things when you need to buy things for you ankle..|`|AA12221392	I would look at many factors- does the student work hard?   do they nornmally  buy their things  themselve? Do they help out around the house without being told? and Do they think it is owed to them?  If my student was working hard on her education, and normally bought the extras she wanted, and helped out around the house without me nagging, and know that they aren't owed anything extra like that as that is not a need, then yes I would.    Just because they are 19 , they are still my kid and I wont them to learn life lessons but sometimes I can still give them thing just because
LI64IZCWaa	so what happens if she has a boy lol|`|Elxuvon8aa	God gives us what He wants us to have so good luck on the five girls I hope she doesnt get in a rut and try to name her son Rosie|`|we0xPfYLaa	First she can't "plan" to have daughters unless shes adopting them.  And thats a little too much.  I would hate that if mine and my sisters names were all flowers.  Kids get made fun of that way.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Good luck having all daughters when you dont get to choose :)|`|RrPjG9x9aa	your friend needs to have a serious sit down with mother nature and let "her" know the plan, because there's no way to ensure she'll have any daughters, let alone 5.....it's all up to the spermmies.  Also, those name are lame.  Ok individually, but really, theme names?  why not just name your kids pencil, desk, paper, ruler, and eraser?|`|TX9igTWraa	i kind of like it! i love all of those names and i think they would be really unique sisters!|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i think thats very pretty.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	Daisy sounds like a stripper name. Looks like her career is set!|`|Qm4BKE13aa	Hope she doesn't have a boy! lol Actually I think that would be cute :)|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Could you get any cheesier...|`|wziUVyVoaa	I think your friend has interesting ambitions, but no one knows what the future holds in store. She could have five boys, who knows? The names are nice and somewhat creative, but anything could happen. You can't plan the sex of your children, and even if you could, your friend is the bravest person I know for wanting to have five girls...I have one sister and we drove my mother absolutely crazy!|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Sounds okay..except they will all be boys.....|`|y8p5GHaZaa	No offense, but I think it is super cheesy.  And she can't exactly plan to just have daughters.  Violet is a pretty name though.|`|4747P6edaa	I think unless your friend is set on adoption, she has some serious misconceptions and needs to be given a good chat on the birds and the bees.|`|AzZ6iJpyaa	i think that themed family names are fun. but these tend to be a little too 'out there' !!|`|5457cff1e601d574465df9d18054d2cdaa	I think of a garden.|`|9rTeVPqBaa	yep i like them names! most lily and violet|`|AeARjAD5aa	Maybe they'd be better as middle names? I do like some separately but together it just kinda sounds like Disney movie main characters... But hey, to each his own...|`|zt20nLKhaa	I think she's setting herself up for a huge disappointment if she ends up having all boys.|`|MBHkcmB4aa	I love the names.... That will be cool to have 5 girls!!|`|PjPpdWJyaa	Well to be Honest, I think that it might be cute when they are newborns, but when they get older it would not really be all that cute. I would not want Flower children or to be one , but thats just me.|`|vTGnZsOxaa	Cute. :)
459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Conjoined twins are always identical.  It can't happen with fraternal because fraternal twins aren't one egg seperating, they are TWO eggs that have been fertilized.|`|frpCK0utaa	Wouldnt happen. Conjoined twins are always identical, which means that they started out as one egg and divided. 1 egg, 1 sperm, one sex. always boy/boy or girl/girl.    Fraternal twins, such as me and my twin brother(i am a girl) would never end up cojoined.
fVLRGQVGaa	No. You said he knows but how do you know he knows? Only the mom is 100% sure who the father is. He's not with her 100% of the time. He's entitled to know for sure he's the father. And for any female to be offended is ludicrous, in my opinion.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Yes it is wrong, obviously it displays the lack of trust he has for his wife.|`|KhBmlaefaa	No, it's not wrong. Always good to be sure these days. He obviously has suspicions. It's not lack of trust, you just have to watch out these days and take proper precautions. You never know, people will lie right in your face and some people never know it.|`|DNygQdmVaa	very wrong. thats insulting to his wife.|`|Qm4BKE13aa	If he knows its his he wouldnt want to do a paternity test. He must think there is a chance it isnt his.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	It surely seems as though he doesn't know it is his - or else he wouldn't be considering having a dna test. It is sad and scary, but I have heard as many as 10% of children are born to women when their husband is not the father! I know of cases in my extended family. It could very well be offensive, but these days people are beasts so if it helps him relax I don't think too much of a fuss should be made.. It does put a downer on the parenting experience though - that there is this doubt :(|`|QVWFpC3yaa	Morally Speaking, yes. That is wrong. It show the lack of trust and communication in the relationship, and its also expensive.    But At this day and age, it never hurts to be safe.|`|X4UlpxR0aa	If your friend wants to wait until after the baby is born he can have a paternity test done wihtout his wife even knowing it. You can order an unofficial DNA test online and it's only about $99, you can do it at home, and his wife doesn't have to know about it.
CxRJwJsraa	Gone with the Wind!!!!    Wade being Scarlett's baby, Rhett obviously the main guy, and Beau is Ashley and Melanie's baby.    (I LOVE GwtW, haha).    I think they are all nice names and would make wonderful middle names.  Though I'd keep the spelling Beau. Bo just looks more uneducated to me. Like Beau would be dashing and clever. Bo would be quick to fight and a bit dimwitted.|`|HN47gKD8aa	Nooo Bo is better than beau  wade is cool  Rhett is ok|`|fElrYibYaa	Wade: big fat kid from kim possible  Rhett: California skater   Beau: cute boy from math class|`|iT0lzQxYaa	Interesting... these are all appropriate for middle names, but not for first names.     Pair those middle names with these first names:  Hayden, Aaden, Collin, Joel, Leaf, Kai, Justin, Jamie, Jared, Wyatt    Hope I helped!|`|PUn197AAaa	Well they all sound pretty souther to me. I wouldn't spell Beau Bo. I like Rhett and Beau best for middle names.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Wade- reminds me of Dwayne Wade, its cute for a first name  Rhett- umm dont really know and dont really like it  Beau- A red headed kid that was in my class....I like it spelled that way better than Bo. Bo looks kinda hill billy-ish.|`|Elxuvon8aa	well they are kind of old fashioned but I like them I think of Gone With the Wind because of Rhett but the other two are from the same time period.|`|DP48dIxhaa	Wade reminds me of a racecar driver. Rhett...doesn't make me thinkk of anything. It's just a name! And Beau makes me thinkkk of a hillbilly because its pronounced as Bo...but I like the name regardless! And I would spell it Beau!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	I love Beau! And I prefer Rhett as a nickname for Everett.    How about Everett Beau "Rhett"?    And I prefer the correct spelling of Beau.
xdY5Yq3oaa	I like the flexibility of Daniella.  It gives her the option to change her nickname to suit her personality as she grows... Dani, Danielle, Ella, Elle, Nelly, and the list goes on.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I do not like to comment on names people already have I would hate to give someone hurt feeligs over something they have no control over|`|ej51eWO7aa	daniella b/c her nickname can be dani or ella  :)|`|CWl5V1DQaa	Ella. I think it's really pretty.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Ella.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	Daniella is so very popular. I love old-fashioned names that aren't too popular, but not like Agnes. I mean like Ella or Anna. Ella is so pretty!|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Neither. I cant stand those ella ella umbrella names.|`|HN47gKD8aa	daniella|`|iT0lzQxYaa	They are both FABULOUS names! I love them both... but... I must say, Daniella is pretty FABULOUS!!!    I must go with Daniella, but Ella is a fabulous name, and it is great for a nick name of Daniella. LOVE EM BOTH|`|rgOBHB5uaa	ella|`|zKwI03Ovaa	neither, they are both horrible.|`|vTGnZsOxaa	Daniella. There's a cute ring to it. Plus, Ella could be the nickname.
kpnSKV6Eaa	you should wait untill you go back for your check up to make sure everything is a o k down there.. dont want an infection or anything, anything that goes in there can affect your unhealed cervix|`|n6XYYyoLaa	safe: after your checkup, to make sure your cervix is closed and you won't be prone to infection; many ppl do it before then and are ok, but if u want to play it safe you have to wait....|`|44OH7Si6aa	When you are healed up and aren't going to hurt any stitches by having sex, also keep in mind the birth control issue and use a condom|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is a reason why doctors say to wait.If others didn't, that doesn't mean you need to follow along (remember the "if others jump off the bridge" story? lol)    There are other "fun" things you guys can do.    Take a trip down to the sex shop and discover them.|`|pXSKSS3daa	"I would like to know how soon we can have sex and still be safe"    Six weeks, especially if you're still bleeding. You need to give your body time to heal and if you're still bleeding it means your cervix is still opened. Having sex during this time can introduce bacteria and possible infections.    Of course people have done it before that time and have been fine but it wasn't something I personally wanted to risk. To each their own, though, it's totally up to you.|`|VClxXNs3aa	um, I waited the 6 weeks, doc said go ahead.  I did not want to for about 4 months.  ow.|`|urJIlSBQaa	My husband and i waited only 3 weeks (and i had stiches).  We were just gentle and stopped if it got painful.    We couldnt wait the 6 wks.|`|bfxerFkeaa	well......i guess i ignored the doctors rule.    because when the baby came out, i was trying to go back in.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	6 weeks is the minimum - i waited nearly 10, because i tore and had to have 30 stitches.  They say 6 weeks because that is when you stop bleeding.|`|8D6IbrcTaa	There is a reason why drs tell you to wait, plus 6 weeks isn't that long.  Who would want to rush into having sex just after having a baby??  Let your body recover and just wait, you'll be greatful if you do.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I would wait after you six week doctor's appointment and have the doctor's go-ahead to have sex. I know it's long, but it's worth it.|`|vJEatJFPaa	I had sex 4 weeks after having Olivia C-section..technically you should wait 6 to give your body time to heal and to reduce the risk of infection...When your body feels ready go for it....And if you need more than 6 weeks take it!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No, doctors in very specific parts of the US and Canada say that.  Its cultural, not medical fact.  Even in many parts of the US and Canada doctors will more commonly tell you to have sex before 6 weeks so you can discuss any problems.    Your uterus is no more open to infection after childbirth than when your uterine lining sloughs off during menstruation.  I wouldn't recommend having sex with hookers, but with your partner go right ahead.    My midwife couldn't put stitches in until the next day (long story) and she said "don't have sex until I put the stitches in" and I had a second degree tear.  I think we waited 4 whole days after.    http://www.vhi.ie/hfiles/hf-269.jsp  Resuming Sex?    If you dont have any stitches, are not feeling any soreness or pain and there is no medical reason to avoid sex, then you can start to have sexual intercourse as soon as you like after giving birth. In fact, resuming lovemaking after the birth may help to re-establish the feelings between you and your partner, strengthening your relationship.    If you are breastfeeding your breasts may be very sensitive and feel uncomfortable. Some women feel that while they are breastfeeding their bodies are dedicated to their babies and raised hormone levels during lactation may enhance these feelings.    The usual lubrication of the vagina does not return until some weeks after childbirth and this can cause sexual intercourse to be painful. Using a dissolving vaginal gel available from the chemist can provide additional vaginal lubrication. If you are aware that you have little natural lubrication, you should avoid having a bath before having sex, as this will dry out the tissues further.    It can be frightening to start having sex again after you have been cut or torn and have stitches. In the week or so after having a baby, most women experience some degree of pain when emptying their bladder or bowels and find that walking in the early days after having perineal stitches can be difficult. As a result of this, many women cant bear the thought of being touched, let alone having sexual intercourse.    When a woman does decide to attempt penetrative sex, intercourse may be painful. The best thing is to take it slowly and tentatively with the assurance that your partner will wait, or stop altogether, if you say so.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well you should really wait the 6 weeks, it's hard but it's for the best. I decided I would have sex 4 weeks after my son was born and was in the hospital the next morning because I was gushing blood (sorry TMI) but seriously TRY to wait the 6 weeks, if your feeling absolutely great with no pain or bleeding whatsoever at 4-5 weeks then you can try but don't be surprised if your bleeding returns full force or you have other complications. Waiting 6 weeks would be the best.|`|Z67HkDKCaa	yes, wait! Let your body heal then you can go crazy with confidence! Explain to your man that the purpose of waiting is to let you cervix/pelvic floor heal... If you do it too early - you may cause damage and then you'll have to wait even longer!|`|YqeatZB4aa	I would wait the full 6weeks. There is a reason that they say that sweetie, it is for your own health and safety.|`|weA0Xdszaa	Well you'll know. Try touching there first, and see if it's painful or not. Then when you try, make sure you let your DH know it's just a tryout so he doesn't get frustrated if it's too painful. First few times are gonna be painful...

cSm1zod4aa	I am watching the exact same thing. It has to be devastating! Its just awful. Its great that they have those conventions where those children can go and be around other children with that disease and feel comfortable.|`|mgEs4nK5aa	I must say that these types of Documentaries always make me worry. I mean before I was pregnant and I saw these it made me worry if at some point when I have kids how would I handle something like this. Now that I am pregnant I still feel the same way. But honestly I don't fully know how I'd react or handle such a thing if it was me in their parent's position. I know I'd be devastated after my child was gone, as I'm sure any real parent would be. Nothing will ever stop me from watching these shows because there is always all these things we don't normally know about and it helps to see these things just incase (well usually a BIG just incase) it does effect us one day, but at the same time its hard to watch them when you know that even if it doesn't effect you it is effecting someone somewhere ; ;
YKeF3FyBaa	i LOVE the vasaline lotion in the tall brown bottle  not exactly sure what it is and i'm holding the baby right now so i don't want to wake him to get up and look.  either way its AMAZING for the itching  isn't greasy  and smells amazing!!!!  cruel for pregnancy and motherhood is good too  but they are both the same price and the vasaline has a million times more!|`|LABC73E7aa	eucerin calming creme
UXRwYHrMaa	Get to baby dancing woman! If you dont usually get periods, it means you dont routinely ovulate. But if you have ovulated the last five months, time is a wasting. You can still conceive with PCOS, but for heavens sake dont sit idly by while those precious ovulations are happening. start now!    I think the book "Taking Charge of your Fertility" is priceless because it teaches you to recognize your body's own natural, biological signs that you are fertile and ovulating, so you can better time sex. Plus for people with PCOS who might go three months without ovulating/having a period, it can really save you a lot of those expensive ovulation predictor tests.    Good luck!

Im certain it worked for me. I don't think there is anything wrong with these chips but as its a fatty food i guess you can eat them constantly.  Good luck with your pregnancy!
lLC7Cf2zaa	Well, braxton-hicks can start around that time I guess.  They especially are bad at night and if you're standing too long.  You might just have overdone it or have been through a lot of stress.  But to make sure, you should call your doctor and have them check you out immediately - I'd call them tonight and talk to the oncall doctor.  They'll decide if it can wait until the morning or if you should go to the emergency room, ok?  Good luck!|`|0rUZm5CFaa	Well I'm 24 weeks and I have had the same thing. It is mostly at night. I called my sister, she just had a baby, and told her that I felt like I was having a really bad period. She said that it was a combo of my hips spreding and the baby putting pressure on that area. It sounded right to me. :) but if you are worried, call your doctor. Good luck! :)|`|H4kFPtNbaa	i've hear of several women having cramps and minor spotting during pregnancy but going to the doctor if it gets really bad is not a bad idea. also for more info read what to expect when your expecting, its big but it has EVERYTHING good luck honey!|`|AA10270012	call your doc|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Go get it checked out.  I remember having really really bad cramps around 28 weeks.    Sometimes it can just mean your doing too much...  But yeah go get it checked out..|`|L2xa4gvYaa	well it could be a few things, they could be minor contractions, which means if they get any worse you might want to check with your doc. cause u might be in pre labor..and might go in the real deal soon. or its just cramps because your so far along or because that is usually the week u have your period then that might be it, for a suggestion just relax, take a warm bath or use a heating pad..  i hope everything goes well and congrats your lucky|`|eua5YYYcaa	why ask us...call/go to your OB!!!      PS braxton Hicks can feel like the real thing your stomach gets really hard when you have one though if I remember correctly.      Good luck!  please don't listen to all of these people, every pregnancy is different and you need your DR to help you not a mother who has had her own experience|`|ZI0scBdJaa	mm no i wouldnt worry about itt.. i had the SAME THING im 26 weeks  and i went to the hospital about 4 days ago.. i had REALLY BAD stomach  && back painss. plus diaherra. wasnt contracting. just had a stomach  virus. maybe its somethinq you ate.... but if your worried.. start counting  how many you have in one hour.. and braxton hicks do hurt alittle i  qet them every now and then.. its like a tightening and little cramps in  your stomach... the difference with those and contractions is that  with braxton hicks you can walk around and move around and they*ll  qo away its just your baby doinq that.. so when you have them  turn to your sides.     contractions are a tightening in your stomach ; that are HARD AS ROCK  crampinqqqqq.. in your lower stomach and back pains. usally 15-5  minutes apart.|`|nhJfeh3Qaa	I am 29 weeks pregnant, and this is my 3rd child.  Braxton Hicks are painless, however, when your having them your stomach will feel "tight" and it is almost "breath taking".  Although they aren't "real" contractions, if you have too many in an hour they can put you into preterm labor.  I recently had this problem where I had 10 in an hour and was given medicine to calm down my uterus.      Mild cramping is also normal as your body is going to now start getting itself ready for labor down the road.  Your ligaments are going to stretch to make room for the baby, however, if your concerned that something is wrong do not hesitate to go to the ER.  There can always hook you up to the monitor to see if your having contractions.    Here are some suggestions though that you can try:  drink plenty of fluids, relax and prop your feet, make sure you go to the bathroom, take a warm bath, or lie down on your side.  Usually drinking plenty of fluids and relaxing will help, but if not then it would be a good idea to go to the hospital and visit the nurses on the maternity floor.|`|AA12075640	It's just gas....just kidding.      Braxton Hicks are very uncomfortable, but one thing I used to test if they're the real thing or not, is the frequency and if I'm able to speak/talk easily while having one.  Less than 10/hour is good and if you're able to talk, you should be okay.  Definitely hydrate yourself and remember that most labor pains start in the back and navigate around to the front.  Those really, really, really hurt and you most definitely cannot speak when having one.      Most of all remember, your'e the mom.  If you feel something isn't right, have it checked out.|`|DAruN0GYaa	Could be hicks, however could be early signs as well. your body is adjusting to get itself ready for birth. No bleeding is good. Unfortunately for alot of us moms, hicks can be as bad and sometimes worse than actual childbirth.    Drink some chamomile tea, stay away from any foods that could act as a laxative and keep stretching and preparing yourself for the ultimate miracle =D     call your doctor however just in case and see how far or if you are dilated.|`|AA11763588	Sometimes BH will hurt that bad.

UUpsa35Daa	I've been living on my own since i was 16, not emancipated but my mom gave me permission to move out. I fully support myself, i have 2 jobs and have reached a point where i'm doing really really well. But it took me a little bit to get here, it's very hard in the beginning. I'm 17 now.    Look up emancipation in your state on the internet, but once you have all the information...think long and hard about EVERYTHING that being an adult entails and what you'll be responsible for. Don't think of this as a way to get away from your dad...think of all that will be placed on your shoulders when you go through with it.|`|HOdblqIkaa	laws vary depending on where you live. if you do want to get an emancipation youll need to contact a lawyer and social worker. there are quite a few forms to fill out including proof of financial support. if you dont have a job now and are looking to be emancipated chances are its not gonna go far, wont even go to court. you have to have a job with a steady income and a substantial amount already saved. you will have to get your parents consent to move out of the house and youll have to have a clear reason to not want to be living there. if you do manage to get it to court you will have to be willing to keep your job, remain a full time student, and commit to letting the state check on you until you are of legal age. if you really dont want to live with your parents anymore try to see if you can move in with a relative nearby or somewhere you can transfer schools to live with. i know what its like to not want to live at home anymore and i went about it the wrong way, running away only to get arrested and placed on probation. by the time i was 18 my parents and i barely talked and i moved 1200 miles away from them. now we see each other only on holidays, if that, and i email my mom about once a week. my dad and i dont even talk, not even a call or card on birthdays. i know it sucks right now but trust me those 2 years go fast. if you really cant stand it get an after school job or two so youll be making plenty of money and barely be home. it does halt your social life but when your ready to move out and make it on your own youll have the financial means to while your friends are still living at home.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	Look up emancipation on the internet.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/table_...|`|W9TG52RQaa	It takes a lot of effort, and money.    If the fighting isnt terrible, then don't get emancipated.    You need to prove you can have a job, house, etc. on your own.|`|HcCYeLMAaa	you have to prove you'll be able to support yourself legally ! & you have some way to get back & forth to truth . i know how you feel i seriously thinking about emancipating myself !|`|KDVaGxbHaa	It's not that simple. If the courts had to entertain every teenager who just "didn't want" to live at home anymore they would be overloaded and unable to function! Laws vary from state to state but generally you must provide a compelling reason to be emancipated (abuse, neglect, etc...) and/or have the consent of your parent(s) AND be able to prove that you can support yourself AND at least finish high school.

i1WpKYKHaa	It is better to cut.  It keeps other thing from getting torn in the process.  the stitches will itch, but just make sure you keep yourself clean.  Using betodine is best.  You don't want to get an infection, but infection can be worse without the procedure.  Don't worry you will be fine.  I have had three.  Besides, your partner might appreciate it a little tighter, lol.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had two episiotomies and still tore. It took about 3 weeks to start feeling better and a few months until I was completely pain free. I had a third degree tear (I had a big baby and he was stuck, when they used forceps to get him out I tore reallllllly badly) but hopefully it won't be that way for you! I have always heard that tears heal faster.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	dont ask for one. They are very painful to heal and some times women can feel discomfort at the area years later.   A lot of dr's wont even do a routine cut even if you would prefer one. Do perineal massage before you go into labor, ( just basically put your fingertip in there and start massaging and streching gently) The nurses will do that too at the hospital when you are pushing( streching you out) You wont even notice it though.   I had three babies all over 9 lbs and never had a stitch so it does strech a lot :)   Its better to tear because the cut will be a sharp cut where the tear will be jagged and will heal itself better. Sometimes when they do cut you it gives the tear a start and you end up tearing on top of the cut.   I told my dr absolutely no cutting down there unless the babys life is depending on it|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I think a tear is better.  The first poster has the reasoning right.  I had an episiotomy with my first delivery and the recovery from took quite a while...I didn't like it.  There are a few spots down below that are a little numb now, but it hasn't affected sexual pleasure in any way.    With my second delivery I had a nurse who put hot washcloths on my perinium right before it was time to push and it really helped the skin stretch.  I had a very small tear that caused no pain at all.  It was much better than the first.  You can also try doing perennial massage before you go into labor, it will also give your skin more elasticity and prevent or at least minimize any tearing.  The site below explains how to do the massage.      Make sure your ob/gyn knows your wishes.  Good luck!  :)      ETA:  My tear was so small it didn't even need a stitch, so it's worth a shot!  :)|`|nhJfeh3Qaa	www.babycenter.com is a great website for both during and after pregnancy.  Check  it out and I am sure you will be able to find your answers there.  Although I was never "cut" during either of my deliveries I did however "tear" with both.  My healing process was short and I did not have any complications.  Trying to determine which is better between "cut" and "tear" really is going to depend on your baby.  With my first child, my midwife was getting ready to cut and his head popped right out causing me to tear.  I only had 3 stitches.  If your worried, talk to your doctor.  He or she will be able to answer your concerns.  Good Luck!|`|sdHVvOm4aa	I got an episiotomy with my first. The worst experience of my life. A year later it still hurt to have sex. Recovery was horrid. With my second I tore and need three stitches. Hurt a little. Had sex two months later successfully. I just gave birth on Monday only needed one stitch. Doesn't burn when I pee and the stitch doesn't hurt, although u will hurt even if u don't tear. DON'T get cut. Have a nurse support your perinium while u r pushing|`|2SWcTLi7aa	Ok i know i tore with my son.  I didn't feel it at the time i had an epidural.  When i tore it was bad i had to have many stitches and pain pills. The dr said later that i probably should have been cut and he wouldn't of caused so much damage.  It took about 4 months for me to completly heal after tearing with my son.  No one can truely answer weather its better to cut or tear.  In class we were taught that they prefer to cut. With a cut its clean and heals straiter and easier.  With tearing it jagged and sometimes doesn't heal strait and there can be complication with the healing either way its up to you some ppl donm't even tear any.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	When you tear its possible you may only need a couple stitches. But if they give you an episiotomy they cut you basically from one hole to the other.. Thats alot of stitches. I only needed one single stitch when I tore.|`|44OH7Si6aa	get cut. I got the episiotomy with my son, no problems healed up perfectly fine. I got and episiotomy with my daughter also but she had a very large head and I tore in the front. I can still tell exactly where the tearing was, even after three years it isn't the same way it was before and I feel really awkward about it when my husband is down in that area. He says it's no big deal but agrees that it looks different from before. I absolutely hate it.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	It is better to tear. The line is then rigid and heals at a faster pace then if you cut it on a clean line.  I tore with my son and healed within a week.|`|AA11763588	I had 3rd degree tissue tearing with both of mine. Everything works just right down there and I have no complaints from me, or my husband.    I had my DR check me at my pap smear to make sure I'd be ok to have an VB with this pregnancy, she said I healed up really nice!    So, I told her I don't want to be cut with this one either. I've heard you don't heal right... but I've never had one so I can't say either way.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i have heard from many people that it is better to tear on its own. you heal faster and have less pain because there isnt any incision that the doctor made    im also wondering what to do though so starring your question.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	You can avoid tearing and the epi too.  When they say wait to push try to wait.  Tearing is due to the baby being born too fast.  When you push, push a little less than all your might.  If Diego wants to come slow that is better, it will give you a chance to stretch.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Personal opinion: It will definitely be better to be cut (straight and easier to heal).  If you tear, there is no telling how bad you would tear and you'd probably tear all the way to your butt hole!  Very painful and would take a lot longer to heal if you tear instead of being cut.      The benefits of episiotomy can include:        * Faster birth      * Prevention of tearing      * Protection against incontinence      * Protection against pelvic floor relaxation      * Faster rate of healing than tears    The negative aspects can include:        * Infection      * Increased pain      * An increase in 3rd and 4th degree vaginal lacerations (euphemistically called extensions)      * Longer healing times      * Increased discomfort when intercourse is resumed    Many midwives believe that there are better ways to avoid a tear than getting an episiotomy. These might include:        * Good nutrition (healthy skin stretches more easily)      * Kegels (exercise for your pelvic floor muscles)      * Prenatal discussion with your care provider about episiotomy      * Prenatal perineal massage      * A slowed second stage (controlled pushing)      * Warm compresses, perineal massage and support during delivery    Tearing  Many organizations that do not consider episiotomies as necessary believe that it is better for a woman to tear, but is it really? Some make the argument that not every woman will tear, and that those that do may only tear a tiny bit, resulting in only one or two stitches, vs. the 10, 20 or even more needed with an episiotomy. Not every woman will tear during delivery, and so some women may have episiotomies unnecessarily.    There is a negative side to allowing your body to tear naturally as well. Both episiotomies and tears are considered by degrees. The most common is the second degree tear or cut, which extends halfway back to the womans anus. The least common, but most painful, is the fourth.    Both options today are acceptable in the medical field, and episiotomies are actually done less routinely than they used to be on pregnant women. It is best for a woman to research both options before she goes into labor so that she can choose which one she prefers while writing out her birth plan, and talking to the doctor at delivery.    Good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|eryJKCpfaa	i always heard thats its better to have them cut you than to have your baby rip you. The things we go through, right? Goodluck on your labor!!|`|x4uGfC4oaa	It's much easier for a cut to heal than a tear. Tears are jagged and you don't know where it would happen, or how big the tear would be. If you tear in the wrong spot, you could suffer great damage. However, you may not tear. Honestly, I would rather have an episiotomy myself than to risk a horrible tear.  Good luck!|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I've been told by my doc (and many others!) that to tear naturally is healthier and heals more easily. If you're concerned about it either way, put in your birthplan that you would like to have a shot if it looks like you're going to tear. That way it won't hurt as it would without pain management, and they would give you the shot if they were going to cut you regardless. They can usually tell just beforehand if there's a chance of tearing so you should have enough time to get the pain meds before it happens.

If your boyfriend's step father is physically violent, then you should get involved.    Contact social services in your state.    If you are not sure who to call, ask your parents or a teacher where to turn.    You can invite him to your house as a temporary solution, but if you don't contact the police, your boyfriend may suffer worse when he has to return.   Hopefully not.|`|KRDZ5AQyaa	His step dad probably has a lot of personal issues, himself.      Sometimes someone may allow physical abuse because of low self-esteem.    Your boyfriend needs to confide in an adult of his choosing to remedy the situation.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_vi...|`|q9mFfx0Raa	physically and mentally abused.   you have to think that if he "ran away" to your house for a day imagine what his step father would do about this. im pretty sure he'd get pissed and do something worse than he ever has done.  so if you want to do something, confront him and tell him to talk to his mom or tell him to talk to the police and say you'll go with him or you'll stand by him. all he really needs is someone there.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Him running away from what's happening won't help him...it would only be a temporary fix and at the end of that fix, it might just be really bad with his step dad.    Try to get him to talk to the school counselor or a teacher or trusted adult. It's the only for him to be safe right now because he can't move out until he's of legal age.|`|oOFeoP5raa	aww :( yeah you should tell your parents and ask if he can stay with you for a while, tell him he needs to tell someone (police) and shame on his mother for not doing anything about it....|`|5ocCUojWaa	tell your parents they will know wat to do   if u know this is happening and u dont do something about it   then ur makin it worse cause u do nothing|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Have him come over to your house, as much as, possible.|`|HOdblqIkaa	best thing to do is tell a counselor at school. theyll call the necessary authorities, call him out of class, he might have a physical evaluation, theyll ask him whats going on, then theyll handle it properly. i remember in high school they called the parents into the school so the kid could tell the cops in front of the parents. if he really is being abused hell be placed with family/friends/be taken in by the state while his parents are held in custody by the state pending trial. if his step dad is found guilty its jail time for him and your boyfriend will be able to live at home with his mom or whatever the state decides is best for him. whatever you do do not put yourself at risk. adults who beat children are temperamental and doing something to make his step dad upset with you is placing you at risk. if you dont feel comfortable going to someone you know there are plenty of abuse hotlines to call or have your boyfriend call. the best thing for him right now is to get out of the house but in a legal manner. if he runs away its illegal and when he goes back to his parents he might be in more danger than before.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	1-800-4achild  child abuse hotline|`|LsAArkUyaa	You need to tell your parents or a teacher ASAP.

Maybe go to a councelor, dont say your boyfriend. dont even say friend just say a person.  or talk to him about it.  Goodluck  and im sorry;(  no one deserves it|`|UxbjvAaRaa	ask him if you can tell someone. if so then tell the guidence conscler. go to his house sometime and see if it was just an excuse or if its true. comfort him in his time of need. and pray for him. thats all i know of.

After he moves in with you them tell him you will call the cops and he is to tell them what his father is doing to him and them tell him to press charges and go to court so he will be put in jail and in their they will help him and he can talk to a doctor and he will not do that no one then. Does he know where you live (the father that is) if not them great, if so then I think you should move and find a place so he can not find you, because he can refuse and they can not do anything and then when he gets out he will not find him. If he does not know where you live then stay where you are then and you and your boyfriend will be just find together. He needs someone now he needs U. Let me know how it goes and God Bless.|`|AA12115728	What you can do is encourage him to report the abuse.  He has to be willing to report and testify against his stepfather.  He NEEDS to do this to protect himself and preserve his self-esteem.  You can also talk to your school counselor to tell what you know.  Even if you haven't seen anything, it might help.      This happened to someone I know whose husband lost his temper and struck their daughter.  The bruise was seen at school, and the school counselor reported it to the police/social services.  He had to leave home until a social worker was convinced that it wouldn't happen again. And even though the husband is living in the home again, he doesn't dare lay a hand on the girl.|`|ev3EwV2laa	i dont really know what you can do unless u want to report it..as for now all you can do is comfort him i guess it really depends on how old you guys are|`|Bctc0cEEaa	talk it out with a counselour, they'll know what to odo adn how to handle the situation|`|z3fEGkisaa	Call the cops!|`|rJGUv8eOaa	call the police .. or Just leave..    you probly wont help to talk it out,|`|UkEVj2f1aa	talk to him first then decide something together   really its the best way|`|fkaZPupsaa	Your 'boyfriend' is obviously just making excuses so that he doesn't have to date you. You probably wouldn't put out, so it's your own fault.|`|e2UvFYR0aa	yea maybe him coming to your house is a good idea, and tell your mum or dad about what is happening to him, so there are more people who can help him.  maybe he could try to talk to his stepdad? to try and work things out?  a counsellor is a good idea as well  there isnt really much you can do, so i hope everything will turn out okay
8CPH9l0vaa	Oh the Boppy for SURE! I loved my Boppy. Plus, it works for several other things as the baby grows like I used to put Sophie on the floor with a blanket and set her in the Boppy to help her learn to sit up on her own. It kept her from falling over, and she really enjoyed it a lot! And sometimes, she also liked laying on her blankie using the Boppy to hold her head up. It helped develop her neck muscles. Anyway, I am there are a lot of other uses for the Boppy that I just didn't think of, but point being, I loved it. :)|`|0VUZacRTaa	I have bobby and I LOVE IT|`|3hIr3Dllaa	my brestf friend    the boppy can slide away from your body and the brest friend is held in place with a strap|`|q0mfdHTraa	Boppy for sure!!|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I love the boppy.

But now I just want to enjoy my almost 7 month old.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	i got the best friend since it had the strap.  it worked great, just strap it on and the baby had full support, no worrying about it slipping when you move...it even has a pocket to put things so they are easily accessible when you are tied up.|`|9PqAOQu1aa	I've only ever used the Boppy, but I really love my Boppy.
6tHA0QQXaa	Try sleeping in there with her and see how that works.It may take some adjusting on her part,but it would be good to try.|`|UjI3TuSZaa	You could try taking her out of the crib and start using a mattress on the floor. She's very nearly old enough (isn't it anywhere between 18 months and 3 years or something?) You could lie down with her and go back in to comfort her if she woke up.    We did this with our daughter at 14 months because she just HATED her cot and I didn't want to make her cry it out. She slept much better on the mattress after rolling off a couple of times the first few nights, and slept longer and longer through the night without waking up once she realised she could come in to us if she wanted to.|`|49We7buoaa	I would just let her fall asleep on the bean bag and keep taking her to the crib she will soon get the idea and sleep there the full night if you don't put her in your bed when she wakes up crying 2 hours later just comfort her and put her back in the crib, or move the crib to where she can watch elmo put her in the crib to watch elmo with her binky and hope she will fall asleep there.    If she starts crying and you feel she's crying to hard take her to your bed she might be having separation anxiety at this age and you can try again later when she's a little older good luck!!|`|sZGah4F4aa	You need to let her cry her self to sleep. After a couple days or even a week, she will learn. She isn't hurt, she is just crying because she knows you will come and comfort her. She needs to learn how to do that on her own. Don't wait any longer, the longer you wait the harder it will be.     Good luck. PS Ear plugs.|`|jOJYuv7Taa	Let her cry it out.|`|24P6A0oaaa	my toddler sleeps with me, he is almost two anf for the past two days he has slept in his bed... I thought it was going to be hell! but I put on his show and rubbed his back and he'd fall alseep, if he got out I would put him in timeout..  he usually wakes up in the middle of the night like 4 times and I usually need to lay him back down or pick him up and move around with him and then lay him down  good luck! maybe try a toddler bed?    I also have his bed right next to mine and after he gets it down for a week I will move him into his room    I dont believe in the cry it out method

Anyway, I'm pregnant with my second child and all I feel is gas so far. I've heard that if you are really in tune with your body you can feel the butterflies as early 15 weeks or so, but it is hard to differentiate them from gas especially if its yours first pregnancy and you haven't had that feeling before.   But the further you get along the more pronounced the butterflies will feel...you'll know for sure that its the baby!   Best of luck!|`|8ZARrsnXaa	i don't know just eat more i think he/she is hungry! -)|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Trust me ..  You will no when its your baby..  Its hard to explain what it feels like exactly.

r39EDGhPaa	Why did she want to have sex and risk getting knocked up, even though she KNEW how her parents would react?  She'd seen it happen, but she was too naive to keep it from happening to her?    She could very well be pregnant.  She should have been on birth control.  She's too young to have an abortion without parental notification, she should have considered that before getting knocked up.  If something were to go wrong during the procedure, which it can, her parents would have to be notified anyway.  They're expensive, I doubt they're fully covered anywhere.  In some countries it is, like the UK I think.. but not in the US.  Some places do it on a sliding scale, but not free.  By telling them "hey guys, I didn't want to listen to you..and I got knocked up! :)"|`|VClxXNs3aa	So, what are the chances she is pregnant? approximately 1 in 5.... 20%  Can have an abortion without telling her parents or his? no.  Is there any place that would fund the procedure? ...no.  If she has to, how can she tell her parents? ....I am pregnant.|`|AA10186411	She's a day late and she's already freaking out?  Anyways.  She needs to take a test.  If she is, she needs to tell her parents, and he needs to tell hers.  Instead of KILLING an innocent child, they should give it up for adoption.  Its not the child's fault they couldn't keep their pants on.  Tell her to grow the hell up.|`|HOdblqIkaa	before she stresses too much about it she should take a pregnancy test, or go to planned parenthood where she can get one. it is normal for girls to start a few days late because they arent regular and the stress cant be helping anything,   there is a chance she is pregnant but the only way to know is take a test  idk the abortion laws where you live but in most places you have to be 16 without parents consent so because she is of age yes she can get one without telling her parents  if she is less than 8 weeks along she will be able to have a medical abortion-its not expensive, costs include ultrasound to find out the age of the fetus, medical history review, and the procedure. if she cant afford it planned parenthood has private donations sent into an account for women in this situation. they might ask her to come up with a minimum amount but they will be able to pay for the majority if not all. most private clinics have these same accounts set up for women as well.   if she does tell her parents she just needs to come out with it and say hey im pregnant. there isnt a delicate way to go about it but some counseling centers will be able to help should she enlist in the help of one.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	She should put the baby up for adoption.    An abortion is, slightly analogous to someone eating a chicken.    They rip the wings n' legs off the chicken, just like a vacuum aspiration abortion would do to a baby.    They needs to think about that!!!!!!|`|AA10953999	From what I have heard stress can cause a woman to miss a period. Tell her to go to the doctor and get a pregnancy test. They won't notify her parents.     Also tell her that if she is pregnant go to planned parenthood and learn the pro's and con's of an abortion. They may think they are able to handle it but all the people I know that have had one regret the decision one way or another.    From the day she has that abortion she is going to be calculating her child's age.. my child would have been 4, 10, 15 etc.  It's not an easy decision. Just try to be there for, her good luck.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	lol  She hasn't even taken a pregnancy test yet?  I think the smartest thing to do is to do that before worrying about all the other stuff.  She's probably just psyching herself out.  The stress and fear that she's going through is probably what's making her period late.    Her chances?  A woman has about a 20% - 30% chance of conceiving everytime she has sex.  Considering they used a condom, her chances are significantly reduced.    Can she have an abortion without consent?  It depends where she lives.  In some places, 16 and older can have an abortion without consent.  In other places, its 17 or 18 and older.    A free abortion does not exist.  If she is pregnant and does want an abortion, then she'll have to pay for it out of her own pocket.  Some places offer "discounts" so to speak, but there isn't anywhere she can go that will be completely free.  Its a medical procedure, and those cost money.    How to tell her parents?  That's easy, "Mom, Dad.... I'm pregnant."  There's no easy way to tell them and there's no beating around the bush.  She'll just have to come out with it.    I still can't believe that they've already decided that they want an abortion before they've even taken a pregnancy test.  What's wrong with people today?  Talk about putting the cart before the horse.  Sheesh.|`|JvCzgVnGaa	im against abortion and yes she may be pregnant. just sit down a tell them yes they'll get mad but whos parents dont get mad so tell your friend she needs 2 see a doctor soon and to tell her parents. everthing will be okay|`|wRckyuh6aa	I am soooooooo sick of these 'omg i'm pregnant' questions.

The chances she's pregnant are 1 in 5 in normal sexual intercourse where he cums inside of her. It's lower, but it's a real chance. She needs to take a pregnancy test, obviously. Stress from not knowing often delays periods further.    She would need consent if she's under 18, and as far as I know, there's no place that would fund the procedure (though that might change over time with Obama's executive order).     She obviously needs to be honest. There's no best way so long as we're assuming she's using tact.     Please don't pass on everyone's anti-abortion propaganda. It's clearly the last thing she needs now. If she wants to have a serious conversation about pros and cons of abortion, consider having her talk to a psychologist. Most people go with a gut instinct on the issue and never stop the think about why they believe what they believe and back it up with empirical evidence. For instance: the child wouldn't have a heart beat until it is 5 weeks in utero. It can't feel pain until it develops a nervous system. There's absolutely no consensus on what constitutes life - and that's coming from scientists who devote their lives to finding an answer to that very question.|`|KRDZ5AQyaa	An abortion could lead to physical and emotional scars which make it difficult to enter into a loving and trustful relationship.

NaJPIOheaa	hello :) usually when your cervix is high it means that your ovulating, or pregnant, it will also be soft to the touch. i always think of it this way, is it hard, kind of like the tip of your nose, or soft, like your lips? it can be hard to reach sometimes... and i usually just take that as a "high and soft" :P if its low and hard that usually means your about to get your period. i wouldn't check to see if its opened or closed, to me it just seems like bacteria could get up there for infection.. good luck if your ttc! xo|`|pX9DDdOEaa	Wash your hands and stick between 1-2 2 fingers in your vagina , if it feels like the tip of your nose then it meens that it is closed , but if it feels more like your earlobe and is kind of open then that means that it is more open , (Ovualtion time) so that the sperm can get in .      Hope this helps just a bit .   If you still can not feel it then try getting an ovulation kit and using it every morning when you first wake up and it will give you the days you are most fertile.|`|cm87ujQ1aa	Ive heard that once u have found it....feel around and if it feels like the tip of ur nose then it is still hard,but if it feels like ur mouth(lips) sitting loosely then ur cervix is softening...hope that helps!!
E9OJ1xB3aa	Twins is not dependent on age, unless as others have pointed out, you are older. (The chance actually increases to 17% if you're over 45.) The most common factor is family history and hormones.  If your family has a history of producing multiple births (or the fathers) then your chances increase. Also if you are taking medicines to help you get or sustain a pregnancy, your chances increase. (I doubt that this last one applies in your situation, but you never know.)     However- If you are under age 25 then your chances of having twins is half that of women who are 35 or older. So I would say- wait for the ultrasound and go from there. The chances are slim that she is having twins if you base it on age alone. But as everyone here, myself included, there are many factors that go into determining the odds of having a multiple birth.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	twins have nothing to do with age.  It may be affected by genetic.|`|Qm4BKE13aa	Twins on the fathers side doesn't have any effect on chances of having twins, It would be your mothers side (if twins are fraternal) and you and your sisters chances would be higher because more eggs can be released.

I had identical twins at 22. Good luck to your sister and your family!|`|f4Y4yWQ9aa	age has nothing to do with twins/multiples. the fact that the father is a twin pays a role in it and if you have any twins on your side of the family pays a role in it too.|`|44OH7Si6aa	The only factor of age and twins is that as you get older, up to age 35, you become more likely to have fraternal twins but her chances of having fraternal twins can also be affected by family history of twins.

1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	Ok, here's mine.  I started drinking and doing drugs (pot/shrooms) my freshman year in college.  I graduated and grew up.  I married a man who was a drinker/drug user (heavier drugs) in high school, that I dated in college, and have been married for 12 years. We both have successful jobs, haven't done drugs since college, have beer from Dec. 2007 (Christmas Bud, lol!) in the fridge still, because we now have three wonderful children and don't have time for/or any desire for drinking.    Soooo...I am not by any means telling you to go drink and do drugs!  You seem to be very bright, ambitious, and centered.  But....although a lot of people may get into drugs and really screw themselves and their lives up, not everyone ends up a scuzzy f'up either.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Lol well I drink sometimes and smoke pot, and it's fun, sure, but definitely not something that should be done every day.  You can have just as much fun without either.    Think about it like this,  the people who do those things will end up killing their livers and with blackened lungs.  you'll be the lawyer or the vet or whatever with tons of cash, and a big house.  The majority of kids I know who drink and do drugs never attend school, so they will go nowhere in life.  You can't go anywhere without a high school education.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's media that is affecting their self esteem.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Media, media, media. Movies, television shows, video games (etc) all have sex, drugs and crime. Why do you think all 3 rates have increased?   You don't need neither of those things to have fun - especially when you're in highschool. The main thing that you should be focused on is your school work. Once you're done and ready to do something productive with your life the people who wasted their time getting drunk or high will either still be in school, or addicted to the drugs/alcohol and will have no success what so ever. I'm not saying all of the kids who do drugs/alcohol will turn out like that... but it's likely.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Kids normally use weed. People become tolerant to weed after awhile so they move on to bigger drugs, normally heroin or coke. It all leads to one another eventually because the body becomes tolerant to it.    I think kids are way too cavalier about drugs these days. They are all about legalizing weed. I remember the egg commercial (this is what your brain looks like on drugs) I am completely against drugs.     You never hear of a druggy becoming someone, they are normally living at home at 30 still where they were when they were 14 years old....in the basement doing drugs.|`|kRmuf3gfaa	Well here's a personal expierience.  My life xD  Okay so I'm 16, and dropped out of highschool.  I have a family that isn't blood.  And a family that is.  My blood family. Well, my mom and her girlfriend, are alchoholics.  And York and Evalyn, my other family, drink sometimes, and smoke weed everyday.  I drink sometimes, and I usually smoke every day.  So anyhow.  My mom and Katie. Well, we're currently living in a hotel o_O  None of us have jobs. (In my defense I need knee surgery before I can work because my knee constantly pops out of place. When it does I can not stand on it) Anyhow. We have no jobs. So we usually have no money. When they get money, it goes to alchohol and ciggarettes.  So their life turned out pretty bad.    Now York and Evalyn. They have a 2 year old boy. They're on social security because York does not do good working with people. He has some mental ****. Don't get me wrong he my big brother so I'm not dissin on him. Evalyn I know is epileptic, I dono anything else though.  Well they have their own apartment, with water and electric. Nothing is overdue. They have clothes, food, beds, money, etc.  So they carry their own.  Plus the weed and alchohol and whatever else.  Like the superbowl party this weekend. Let's say we'll be f*cked up pretty much all week.    So it could turn out two ways.  My highschool buddies party with me too.  They are still in school and doing well.  Either way, it turns out one of two ways. Either you make it just fine, or you don't.|`|w5aVE1LUaa	Because everyone else does it.

A lot of teens will say that they can resist and won't ever do it, but I can unsure you, most teens end up trying it least once or twice. I'm not saying ALL teens do, but I'm sure your understanding what I'm saying.    After high school, some might end up with a "not so great" lifestyle, but just because they do those things in high school doesn't mean they will surely become a druggie for life. You choose where you want to go in life, not alcohol or drugs.|`|AA12115728	They might be more accepted by the loudest and the brashest kids in high school.  I doubt that they are having quality bonding experiences with these other kids, though.  There's too much booze and drugs in the way of any real connecting.    I had an alcoholic father, so I can tell you that some people do live productive lives in spite of their substance abuse, because he did hold down a job.  But he was always in trouble with work because of his drinking.  He lost his family after 16 years of marriage.  The drinking consumed him, and interfered with every aspect of his life.    An occasional drink, when you are old enough, is not going to destroy your life.  I think you know what kind of drinking/drugging I'm talking about from your observations of these wild kids.    It may not seem so now, but I think you're making the most of your life by choosing to live clean.|`|owpjHPOxaa	Well, I think it's a mix of the adolescent urge to rebel, plus the feeling of fitting in.  You see, What was rebellious for our grandparents when they were teens was to do drugs, alcohol binges, etc.     But now, kids still want to be rebellious and do this, even though presently it's actually pretty conformist.  So, yeah.  Then This need to fit in with "the crowd" shows up, and since "the crowd" is now on weed, we get "the druggies" (population: most of the school)    Their lives are not better than yours.  If they think they're being unique by following the crowd, what does that make you?  Their lives will not be better than yours in the future, either.    And stories?... My Aunt got into drugs, got pregnant at 16, got kicked out of the house... the father left her... the relationship between her and my grandparents is pretty bad.  How is alienating your own parents for the rest of your life for "catching up?"|`|mcywqcHuaa	i smoke weed about twice a month. i don't do it with anyone who goes to my high school, save for about two people. everyone knows i do, but it hasn't changed my social status for better or worse. it's all how people handle it|`|o0U2K84oaa	I've been thinking the same thing, I geuss we all just want to belong and we feel like an outcast if you are not doing everything that others are doing. That's all I came up with. Some people do it while they're in high school mostly on weekends, but serious druggies use it daily.
0VUZacRTaa	well....the first few hours was a breeze. then after i was in labor for about 12 hours it started getting worse, but I could have handled it. Then I opted for the IV drugs. That I DO NOT recommend. made me miserable. but then I got the epidural and I hade the BEST birth experiance!!! I was in labor for 24 hours.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Mine went very, very quickly.  At 32 weeks, much to my surprise, my water broke.  I'd been having some cramping and pain in my anal area, but when that water broke I was stunned.  Then the labor pains started, hot and heavy, only 3-4 minutes apart.  When I got to the hospital, I was dilated to 1.  45 minutes later, I was a 3.  An hour after that, I was at 7.  I live in a small city, and due to the fact that mine was a bit of a high risk pregnancy, they wanted to transport me to Indianapolis...but there was no time.  The doctor joked that if he tried to send me, I'd have the baby in Elwood, a small town about 20 miles away.  The quickness of my labor also meant that there was no time for an epidural, something I had been planning on and DEPENDING on to keep me sane!  And those labor pains HURT!  It was the worst pain I've ever experienced, and I've experienced a lot of different types of physical pain.  When they brought the stirrups out, I didn't think I was going to make it through alive. When he was coming out, it felt like my vagina was on fire, literally burning, because I'd had no meds to numb the pain except for a shot of Stadol--and I wouldn't recommend that to anybody.  Did no good at all.  From the time my water broke until he came out--3 hours and 36 minutes.    Now here's the incredible thing...after I'd been cleaned up and stitched up, about 40 minutes after he was born and they had whisked him away to the intensive care nursery and I was still in the labor room...I found myself sitting up and chatting excitedly, and I hardly felt any pain at all.  When I realized that I wasn't feeling any pain, I was stupefied.  I remember saying, "Did I really just have a baby?  How can anybody feel this good after having a baby with no painkillers?"  When I got up to walk to the nursery, my legs were extremely shaky and I had to have help.  About 8 hours later...the back pain and pain from my stitches was excrutiating, and continued to be pretty bad for 2 days.  You know what the great thing about the pain of childbirth is?  It's finite--it will come to an end. If I could do it again, I would, but I've had mulitiple miscarriages, so he's my only baby.|`|xGedX2rIaa	i had my first when i was 18. i had him 6 weeks early. My water broke at home a 3am on boxing day morning, went into hospital soon after. Nurse said labour would soon start.

agfiNdLraa	THANKS!!!!!!!!
AA12075640	For me, it was within 24 hours.  I must say, though, I had the doctor remove mine.  I think her touching my cervix kick started everything, too.     Good Luck|`|PKyzcW7Faa	Check this out.   http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...|`|syrh8J6Vaa	You may still have to be induced.  I was dilated to 2 for over a month and lost my mucous plug 2 weeks before I went into labor.  Good luck hun|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Don't want to get your hopes low  BUT..  I lost my mucus plug two weeks ago now and my bub has been fully in position and everything aswel..  and i still haven't had anything.  But different people do different things, just wait and see, but dont get your hopes up too high like i did cos they just got ruined when my little one didnt and still hasnt come.|`|irGE84Qdaa	v soon may be in a day or 2 or could take a week too but m sure labor is near.  good luck|`|PymLdXM8aa	could be a couple weeks or more... and you usually loose your plug in chunks.. not all at once. At least thats what i have read. But seeing as how you are 40 weeks already i would say to get ready now :) GL and congrats to you!|`|Gr78AFvyaa	IT could be within hours it could be days...I am 39 weeks with an 8 pounder, soft dilated cervix, lost my mucus plug days and days ago and labor is no where near...only your baby knows when baby is coming. hopefully for you it will be sooner than later!!   labor is a waiting game...  WALK WALK WALK and have lots of intercourse is what my doctor tells me to get labor going!|`|DAruN0GYaa	Just keep calm, breathe, breath. lol. if you stress out, your baby will become stressed as well. Focus on your heart rate and breathing.    Could be a few hours. However if you are loosing your plug right now as in today, its time to get your hiney to a hospital. If you arent in labor, and your plug comes out you will start to release the fluid from inside your uterus... Not good.       Call your doctor but remain calm and try not to walk alot, lay in bed on your side as much as possible, no baths, etc.|`|c05f49b3f4c027d416f383d20cd2f813aa	it can start really really soon. well mine they popped my water i still didnt have him until 12 hours after..but my labor was extremely loong ( 35 hours!!YUK) good luck to you!!|`|sOmclv4Paa	the first answer is retarded.  you should not answer if you dont know what your talkin about.    i lost mine and had baby two weeks later.|`|drI8pdV0aa	I lost my mucus plug a few months before my son was born sooooo.... dont get ur hopes up. Its normal. If labor starts then yeah duh go to the doctor but just relax. My son was in position for months to but was in labor for 26 hours and had to have a c-section
GAMypxIFaa	He seems sweet, I am surprised you feel like doing the deed!! Since about 32 weeks my poor guy has been denied and i feel soooo bad but i am not in the mood and he really doesn't seem to mind, he can't wait until he has me back though! Things will likely get back to the norm after you have the baby and get get into it again! It may not be you at all it may be fear of the baby being so big now and afraid to hurt it or you! I wouldn't stress, do EXTRA things to pleasure him if you know what i mean, that is what i do and it seems to work!!|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Don't worry.  Hes just scared that he is going to hurt you and probably feels awkward making love to a heaving pregnant woman.  You just need to talk to him about this because there is no point jumping to conclusions.  Your relationship will be fine once the baby is born and Im sure that your sex life will go back to normal.  Good luck.|`|xOr67VDiaa	you should talk to him about it, tell him how youre feeling. most men do get distant because they just dont know what to do. so if they leave us alone then they cant get into trouble lol. my husband was the same but we have been married for 5 years now and it has changed but we have changed with it and work together. its not you, you are carrying his baby, which means youre pretty much the center of his world. let him share his feelings with you, and you will work thru it together. im sure he has mixed feelings, just cos he doesnt know what youre really going thru.|`|3qrSUE7uaa	Maybe he's not into preggers chicks?|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I think that it is totally normal to be worried. Maybe your guy is just getting nervous and so hes just not into it right now. It sounds like he still is just as in love, he probably just has a lot on his mind, just like I'm sure you do. Everything will be fine, just try not to worry.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	same thing happened to me  exactly  and YES it's normal  i read reviews  and cried all the time thinking my husband didn't find me attractive  trust me, he wouldn't lie  if he is sweet and kind and excited like you say  then he is just worried about hurting you or the baby  to be honest, when i got big (before i popped) i didn't really want to have sex  but i wanted my husband to want to  and when he didn't i worried  but he did  he was just scared to hurt me  or the baby  he finally told me when i asked what the problem is  everything will be fine  i had the baby and we are closer than ever before  and the sex is better too  haha

Congrats on your baby!|`|YKeF3FyBaa	wow, go to the hospital  it's time!  i don't suggest anything for dilation  they are all dangerous  but you don't need it.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	If they're five minutes apart, i'd head to the hospital or birthing center.

I think Emerson is a little too girly, but probably because the only Emerson I know is a girl.    I don't like the other ones.|`|rZ9QcYgeaa	I think they would all make great middle names!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	There is nothing weird about Emerson, Emmett, Weston, and Westley. I would not call Roman weird either.    Boston is a place, not a name.    Sutton and Hudson are more like surnames.      [Edit] Poster above, there is nothing "girly" about Emerson. It means SON of Emery. It is extremely masculine and extremely boyish.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	The only one I reallylike is Weston|`|vOFdHvlvaa	No i don't think they are too weird, i think they are actual kinda cute.

Sutton - it could work on the right kid, but its okay  Hudson - its to much of a last names first kind of name  Emerson - i like it but then i don't, i like it someone else's kid but i couldn't picture using it for myself just because its such a unisex name. I like the nickname Emme for a girl but with the ending -son it seems like a boys name. I can't really decide.  Emmett - its okay , kind of like Emerson for me  Weston or Westley - I like Wesley ( this spelling ) .    I don't think your names are to weird|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I know a couple of Romans, pronounced Roh-mahn.  One is Ukranian and one is Polish.  I like the name; one of the Romans is called Ray for short.    Boston is cute but as a middle name, I wouldn't want to walk around being called Boston all day.    Hudson is very very nice, that's my top pick out of your choices!  Love it!    Not crazy about Sutton, Emerson, Emmett or Weston/Wesley.|`|4747P6edaa	many of these are last names, and two are places. One is a people. that is pretty weird.

But they're not really my favourites either.    I like Boston, Emmett and Emerson.  I think they're lovely.    Roman is a little to melodramatic soap-opera-y name.  You know.  Take a character, give him a hyper-masculine name and a dark stormy past, etc etc.    Hudson's really interesting.  I haven't decided if I really like it, or really hate it.    Sutton is a lastname of several people I know, I'm not quite sure if it sounds first-name-y enough to be used that way.    Weston/Westley sound a little meek to me.|`|PuRpsENEaa	A friends little brothers names are Hudson Steven  Emerson Weston and Avery Jet. So i'd say those names are just fine. lol :)|`|NBOBMQwdaa	The only ones that I think might be a bit strange are Roman and Boston. The others are nice though. My favorites are Emmet and Westley.
PFO1jxZGaa	mine did that. I would tap her on her mouth and tell her no. It took her about two months but she stopped. It might be just becaues he has something new in his mouth and he wants to play with it. In that cae it will get old soon and he'll forget it. If he doesnt stop though you should ask your dr about some kind of teeth guard because they can really damage their teeth if they keep on grinding them. Especially if he does it in his sleep|`|n6XYYyoLaa	talk to the doc, that's a little unusual; not sure what they could do about it in one so young , but it doesn't hurt to ask|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...  Bruxism - Helping Children Who Grind Their Teeth At Night  Like sucking on pacifiers and thumbs, grinding the teeth (called bruxism) is a common habit that usually disappears on its own as young children grow. The two peak periods of bruxism are as the baby teeth arrive in very young children and again at 5 or 6 as the permanent teeth begin to come in. Grinding could slowly damage the enamel of the teeth, but the baby teeth do not remain in place long enough for that to be a concern. The habit usually stops long before permanent damage to the adult teeth occurs. In the short run nothing needs to be done, but anything relaxing before bed might help (a warm bath, a backrub, some soothing music, some chamomile tea). If the bruxism continues, your dentist might provide a temporary appliance to break the habit of nighttime grinding.     http://www.babycenter.com/0_teeth-grindi...  Why does my toddler grind his teeth?    Experts don't know for sure what causes teeth grinding, but they point fingers at tension or anxiety, pain (from earaches or teething, for example), and malocclusion (a dental term for when the teeth don't line up just right). Some also suggest that allergies may play a role. And there's some evidence that pinworms are sometimes the culprit. Finally, your toddler may just be getting used to the sensation of having teeth in his mouth.    Your child is a bit more likely to grind his teeth if you do. He's also more likely to grind if he drools or talks in his sleep.    About 38 percent of children grind their teeth, according to a 2005 study published in the Journal of Dentistry for Children. The average age for starting the habit is around 3 1/2 years and the average age for stopping is 6  though, of course, people of all ages grind their teeth. Almost all teeth grinding happens at night.  Is it bad for him?    In most cases, teeth grinding isn't harmful. It's very unlikely that your toddler's doing any damage to his teeth, and it's very likely that he'll soon outgrow the habit. Mention it to his dentist, though, so she can check the teeth for wear and any resulting problems, like pulp exposure, cavities, and fractures.  Can I do anything to help him stop?    Although the noise is probably disconcerting, most likely you'll just have to wait for your toddler to grow out of it. In the meantime, it won't hurt to work on a soothing bedtime routine  maybe a leisurely soak in the tub, a little back rub, or extra cuddling in the rocking chair. If he's teething or has an ear infection, consider giving him the proper dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to ease the discomfort.    Older children are sometimes fitted with a night guard  a plastic device fitted to the mouth to prevent clenching and grinding of the teeth during sleep. But your child's dentist probably won't consider this an option until your child has at least some permanent teeth, around age 6.    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/az40.asp  My 12-month-old grinds his teeth while awake and sleeping what can I do to stop him and will it hurt his teeth?"    In general, grinding the baby teeth is not a problem. It is often a sign of teething, very likely for a 12 month old. When he starts losing his baby teeth, the grinding should stop (if it even lasts that long). If he is grinding his adult teeth, then that is a different story, and a dentist should be consulted to look for damage. He might suggest that a tooth guard be worn while sleeping.|`|WG4zNIlTaa	Have them pulled. They will get new ones within 10 years. They already only eat soft foods|`|WNB4Vojsaa	what you can do is to not worry. we did, it goes away.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	My daughter's pediatrician said it was perfectly normal and there's really nothing you can do.  They do it because they don't yet have back molars and have no bite yet.  So when they bite down their top and bottom teeth grind together.  My daughter has actually chipped a tiny piece of her tooth off and her doctor said not to worry, by the time her adult teeth come in she won't do it anymore.  The sound drove me crazy at first, now i'm used to it and don't even notice anymore.|`|tu81vdQWaa	give em a mouffpeice|`|Inw5heh8aa	ask a doctor about a mouth guard maybe|`|0oOquvruaa	ahhhh **** ahhhh|`|T7vuRDCVaa	give that baby some jerky. Good for him and it solves the problem.|`|cYcuSINgaa	my little sister used to do that.  i dont think my parents did anything and she just eventually stopped.|`|KVlaTr9maa	you can't really do anything now, until he gets older. if it gets really bad, talk to your doctor about it.   dont worry about it.|`|xdY5Yq3oaa	It may be a sign of underlying stress or anxiety.  You might consider techniques for relaxation, maintaining a soothing environment, building trust, etc.|`|i0sgEZc6aa	knock them out with your fist|`|Rp5b3gSLaa	You should really ask your doctor about this|`|dXxXj9mKaa	uh|`|ZnywY78Daa	Pull its teeth out, they will grow back right?|`|YqeatZB4aa	Mine did that as well. It was something that he grew out of though, I think it was just kind of oh this is a new sensation and new noise and then he got over it.|`|15ETCoUZaa	Try calling their doctor.|`|XfHqIc0Oaa	What i did when my kids started doing it was just to give them something they could chew on.  They both got over it in a couple wks.  It's just something new that they have learned to do and it makes a noise!!!|`|DAruN0GYaa	give baby some biter biscuits, i did that with my son who is three years old now. taking your baby to the dentist could help as well, they always have suggestions, most babies grind for a small stage but it goes away.    Small rubber toys that go in the freezer might help too. could be new teeth coming and causing her/him discomfort|`|rSt7GCZvaa	stop feeding them drugs
YqeatZB4aa	Sweetie, it is normal to feel that way. but the only way to become more than what you are is do something about it. No one is going to hand you a college degree, you have to work at it, no one is going to give you a good job you have to look for one and do what it takes to get it. I faced this same problem when I was your age. Just put your mind to what you want and don't take your eyes off the goal, you can do it! Good luck!|`|owpjHPOxaa	What are you good at?  what do you like doing?  Find something to do with yourself.  It makes life better, more interesting, and gives you more of a purpose.    Did you know retired people with nothing to do die quicker than those who don't retire or have "stuff to do?"  It's true.    Plus, you're so young!  You have lots of time to find what you're on this earth for.  Perhaps you could make it your job to find out what exactly that is...|`|wRckyuh6aa	go to college become something. You young so you've got heaps of time.|`|dgM66nRBaa	everyone hit that point in life (it's not going to be the first time) where they just need to get away and everything to start over
sLUGZZMDaa	He is doing great...he sounds very intelligent. Keep reading to him. To answer your question, for a boy, he is probably more advanced than normal. Keep reading to him and treating him as though he is a person, and you will be amazed at the rate of growth he has. Congratulations and good luck.|`|8D6IbrcTaa	Sounds like your son may be gifted. What a clever little boy, you must be so proud.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	My daughter is 16 months and she's exactly the same. She repeats everything, can point to eyes nose mouth and say them. She will pinch your cheek and say cheek. She says her abc's when you say them with her.|`|YqeatZB4aa	He seems advanced, I wouldn't worry about it though. It could be that he is just picking up on things quicker, or maybe you have a genius baby on your hands.|`|0cBEbHlHaa	smart baby|`|17c9652c588d0895008ca5507d3558f9aa	He sounds advanced to me. My son is 22 months old and I know he wasn't saying that much at 15 months. At 15 months he said mama, dada, baba, and a few other words.  I think he was about 18 months when he would start repeating words. And didn't start putting two words together until he was about 20 months. At 22 months he can put 3 words together and knows about 200+ words. But he usually only puts 2 together.     He has known the difference between animals and other objects for a long time. I remember at 10 months he could point out pictures in his book. That is one of his strong points. I have a picture book with 1000 pictures in it and he know almost everyone. He can recognize over 30 animals now and can read several words.  But I also read to him everyday. He loves books.     Make sure you keep reading to him, he sounds like he is going to be smart. That's great that he picks up things so easy. It makes it easier on you and him. He can tell you what he wants or needs.|`|jp6AAJwaaa	Don't worry. My son was like that too. He learn to talk first then to walk. He started to talk at 12 months. and 2 months later he can create his own sentence. I think thats what you get if you read to him as early as possible. If you treat him like a big boy, you will be amazed to see his character as compared to his peers. congrats.
NI8D46J0aa	If she had the nuvaring in, then it wasn't unprotected. Do you mean you just didn't use a  condo m    as extra protection? Take a test to be sure either way.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Theres no way to tell besides her taking a test or going to the doctor.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Let her take a test.|`|XywHOzKCaa	Shes pregnant. To be sure, take a pregnancy test.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	could be pregnant  could be stress because she is scared she got pregnant as a result of the unprotected sex  take a test  that's the best way to tell|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	no no no i don't believe shes pregnant. but it could be a possibility.  breast tender you get even if you are birth control.. you don't usually get nauseous in pregnancy till atleast 2 months. and if you just had sex a week and a half a go.. she wouldn't be 2 months pregnant.     if it makes you guys feel better go take a test. sometimes thats all you can do to feel better. when i was on birth control i still got breast tenderness and you get nauseous sometimes..     PLUS if you believe your pregnant you can actually trick your mind in to thinking you are pregnant when you really aren't. so good luck i hope this helped you out.|`|d017cc02830140e5398ad7c8d94a71e1aa	she could be starting her period, or just having the symptom's   ........ or she could be just stressing! take a test EPT works good
WO7WAP19aa	Some people do get just one last period when they are pregnant, but no more after that, only the period that due next would come (maybe) then after that, should be nothing, but you probably arent pregnant, its very rare that someone does get there period while pregnant    Good Luck though bub! x X x|`|n1D90COxaa	You should be good to go, but just to cover your bases, take a PG test.|`|cSm1zod4aa	If its a normal period, i doubt you were ever pregnant, if its heavier and worse than normal its probably a miscarriage. If it is lighter (in flow) and darker in color such as a brownish dark redish color it could possibly be implantation bleeding. If its just spotting then you could be pregnant. Wait until it stops and then take a test.|`|mFQydvncaa	if its bright red blood and a normal period your most likly not pregnant, however if its just spotting, you could be!  goodluck!|`|qiYjhM4Gaa	hmm.. what you described sounded like it would be implantation bleeding. some women have what seems to be a normal period while they're pregnant. if you took a hpt (get it from any drugstore or wal mart even) then you would most likely be able to get accurate results. you can get em for under ten dollars. good luck tho! sounds like it could go either way.|`|c3b3185d7911be1f501fbbeb533ce83faa	Your chances of being pregnant and knowing you just had your menstrual cycle is properly very low. If you were pregnant, the fertilized egg will product a hormone HCG (thats what pregnancy test detects, HCG present you are pregnant and HCG not present you are not ), which will increase your Estrogens and Progesterone level to keep the wall of your uterus thick (thats when you feel blowed and cramps) so the fertilized egg can have its nutritions.  But if HCG is not present ( that means your egg is not fertilized) your Estrogens and Progesterone will decrease, causing your thick wall of your uterus to bleed out (flushing out the unfertilized egg also).  Thats when you have your period.  Well I hope that helps you understands it better.

AA11920812	(((BIG HUGS)))    I have to admit I have no idea how torn you must be. As parents we never imagine this could happen to us. I had a very close friend of mine go into premature labor at around 20 weeks and ended up losing her precious baby girl. I know watching someone go through that is heart wrenching. Especially hard because you can`t make the pain go away for them...although you want to so bad.    Just understand the people around you feel that way. They love you and hate to see you hurting. They want to take it away but have no idea how. Or what to do or say. This has to be hard for your boyfriend/husband as well.     As well as cause, usually if its out of the blue they atribute it to SIDS. I heard there is a new scan to specifically show a problem in the brain stem. This undeveloped soft area in the stem makes sleeping in a deep sleep easier for these children. And, once in that state they can`t regulate their breating or body temp - anything associated with that area of the brain.    They are hoping with these technologies to test for SIDS at the hospital so parents are aware. Possibly use some type of regulator with breathing or a monitor of sorts to keep this from happening. This is all so new though...    I pray you find some comfort and peace in God`s arms.|`|MtKqi5VBaa	Oh honey, I'm crying right now. I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'll pray for you guys tonight.   My guess would be SIDS as well.   Please stay strong, and I hope you have a support system at home.   Oh man........|`|Lnpqs5lHaa	might be SIDS.  sudden infant death syndromn    i dont know the exact definition.    Im so sorry about your loss.    I know someone who lost their son after 1 week due to sids.|`|XQH72YZWaa	i SO SORRY about your loss    did the baby sleep with a pillow becuase i heard that they can sufocate with a pillow  did it sleep with you in your bed becuase i heard that people can put blankets over a baby or roll ontop of it    not saying u did this just trying to help...im so sorry|`|YKeF3FyBaa	I am so sorry for your loss  I assume they called it SIDS  sudden infant death syndrome  this actually can be caused my suffocation if the baby was surrounded by blankets or slept on the stomach  also, SOME studies suggest the consumption of excess caffeine during pregnancy can cause SIDS|`|hQppQFILaa	I'm sincerely sorry for your loss...    my guess would be SIDS...|`|eydt3Rewaa	i'm saddened to hear , you must be devastated, umm sudden infant death comes to mind [sids}|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Your Dr. would probably be the best one to ask this. Could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, but not enough info to go on without full medical eval. God bless you in your time of loss and grieving.|`|mAJZFmIEaa	wow, i'm sorry for your loss.. first thought that comes to mind is SIDS although it is rare under one month of age it does still happen|`|RAzV6v5Aaa	omg! im sooo sorry!  i cant rly answer, it could hav been many things  but im so sry 4 ure loss!  honestly.|`|UXRwYHrMaa	First of all, I am so terribly sorry for your loss. And I know that it seems like being able to make sense of it will somehow make it better. It may be that the doctors will be able to figure something out, perhaps some physical defect that they didn't notice before. But it may well be that they can never explain the cause. it is pretty amazing the things that doctors still cannot explain about infants. SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is essentially a catch all term for an infant that dies and doctors cannot explain why.|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	My sympathy on your loss!    SIDS or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome can happen without a great deal of warning. Sometimes, Heart problems can also be undetected, such as a foramen or patent ovale in the heart ventricle.    Anything that would be said here, however, would simply be speculation. If you need more support, turn to family and your minister. Ask your doctor about support groups for grieving parents.    Sometimes there just aren't any answers and nothing can make up for your loss. God bless!|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Sounds like maybe SIDS. :( I'm really sorry about your loss. :(    My mom had a friend whose baby died.  She put her baby on the sofa in front of her while she ironed and she looked up and she could just tell. :(|`|q2cuRzaKaa	this happened to my twin sister...im 13.. well she had a healthy prg. and my sister died 3 days after because her heart stoped cause her body just gave up....i was told that the first 6 days of a baby's life they can be close to death and some times there body just stops working....i think it's called SIDS    sudden infant death syndrome|`|AeARjAD5aa	I'm so sorry for your loss... It's probably very heartbreaking. My only guess though is SIDS.. and as far as I know there isn't any way to prevent it or know it could happen. Again, I am sorry, but good luck and hope they find an answer for you.|`|qiYjhM4Gaa	SIDS would be my guess.. i'm sorry you're going through that, my prayers are with you. just remember that everything happens for a reason|`|JITTMjasaa	I'm sorry hon. It was too early. God is taking care of her now...she is in good hands. I don't know what could have caused it but whatever it is it can't be changed. I know that finding the reason for her death will help with closure but remember there is nothing you can do about it. And that's ok. You aren't a superhero. Most importantly, don't blame yourself. It is not your fault. This kind of thing happens all the time. Find a good support group. Don't "suck it up". You have to take care of yourself, physically and mentally. Good luck, God Bless.|`|ctNNzYW6aa	There have been many theories about what causes SIDS, and no definitive answers.  No matter what answer you get, I suspect that you'll never stop wondering why.  Please find a support group for  parents who have also suffered and lived through this horrible loss.|`|EPVWrEOxaa	sids maybe?|`|d017cc02830140e5398ad7c8d94a71e1aa	Sids, you can take a class to educate your self better on this matter i know that it has helped me to understand more.. you can call the local fire dept. to see if there are any cpr classes they usually do them together.|`|oJzMFaxuaa	Hey sweetie!  I again am so sorry for your loss.  I answered a previous question of yours but here is what I found on the web for you.  http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml...    Edit:  I know it is hard but you cannot blame yourself for this.  Women put their babies down so they can sleep every day, you did nothing out of the ordinary.  Also, you were in the hospital, if you were doing something wrong, the nurses would have mentioned something.  I know this is sensitive, but you're obviously loooking for answers.  Will you be getting an autopsy preformed?  I hope you get all the information you desire.|`|JlL68gfdaa	im so sorry. i dont know what happened to your beautiful baby but my heart goes out to you xoxo|`|1hciyvKdaa	I am so deeply saddend this happend to you.   There is no real reason known yet. Its a sad part of parenting. It was nothing you did, nothing you could do, God called the baby to be with him much sooner than the rest.   I hope your support circle is near enough to offer support and comfort to you during this time of crisis.   This happend to a friend, it was devistating to everyone.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	SIDS?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If an autospy cannot determine the cause of death, they will more than likely rule it as SIDS.      Sorry for your loss.|`|bgNB9RzNaa	i am so sorry for your loss it sounds like SIDS was she on her tummy|`|47R03TbFaa	Dear I"M sorry for you loss.The reason why your baby may have passed on to god was because of something that may not have been pick up during your pregnancy or it could have been something that was hereditary and you didn't even know about and sometimes its just sudden death syndrome and with that sometimes you may never know why your baby passed on to god .I believe that god only gives you what he thinks you can handle and he may have believed your baby had something wrong with it and you may have not of been able to take care of it .AGAIN I"M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS and if you need a shoulder to write on please write .I"M willing to listen and god bless you during your time of need|`|3b0iEteqaa	Sudden Infant Death Syndrome|`|DNygQdmVaa	SIDS. sudden infant death syndrome.  my brother died at 4 months for no reason...

I believe SIDS is also called Crib Death.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	This is the second time you have asked this today, so I know you must be hurting pretty badly.  I know you are searching for answers, but only God knows why at this point.  The doctors will be able to tell you soon enough, but it won't bring your baby girl back.  Don't be scared to try again, but only when you are ready.  Just believe that this happened for a reason and make sure you find a good support system to lean on.  So sorry for your loss.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	Oh, Im so sorry. Thats really sad!!!!! I am crying for you seriously!!!! Im not being sarcastic!! I know a teacher that I had when I was young who had that happen to her son. He died from something that I am not sure of.

Maybe you could do take her to dinner and a movie, and just spend alot of one on one time or pay a month of her cell phone bill, or order her a new magazine that she  may like .|`|4UN5MBZZaa	just give her more money or get her gift cards from either american eagle or hollister or something. she already has everything else|`|e3LzkOvGaa	A gift card to her favorite store maybe a $50-$100 gift card|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	She has enough STUFF!  For heaven's sake, do something for her birthday WITH her that would be special to her instead of just spending money for things.    Find out if she would like to take a trip to some place special with you or if there is an activity that you could enjoy together.    Since she is 'really sweet', take the time to talk to her about what her hopes and dreams and aspirations are in life and see if you can create a 'dream day' for whatever she'd like to be as an adult.    For example, if she has always wanted to be a pilot, arrange to take her to a flight school to see all about airplanes up close and personal. Take lots of photographs and create a special album about the day. Arrange for a flying tour over your community. Let her speak to people who make aviation their career.    Whatever her interests are, help her have a special day exploring it.|`|02p9wINEaa	Maybe you could buy her a clue as well?    and maybe birth control, according to your other questions?|`|mpc6aNvCaa	what about bath thing like bubble bath or scented soap.
5YCY2ANRaa	One method that truly works is fertility treatments; this is very popular with famous people and it is called IVF, vitro. This method seems to greatly impact the chance of having identical twins! Also older women seem to have a higher percentage of developing twins, this is because older women ovulate multiple eggs. Having a family history of twins will greatly increase your chances of having twins, this is an obvious one. It seems that eating yams may increase the chance of having twins because there is a theory that a certain chemical found in yams help the chance of having twins, but this is only a theory and it is not 100% accurate... I hope this answered your question and anyone else that has been wondering|`|IYkHmVcfaa	Following on from a previous answer regarding IVF twins - you will only have identical twins through IVF IF it divides into 2 cells. But if you are implanted with 2 fertilised eggs and both these continue to develop throughout your pregnancy then they will be non identical.  However, multiple pregnancies reduce the risk of you carrying full time.   I don't think you will be allowed IVF just for the simple reason that you want twins though.|`|9rTeVPqBaa	i dont think u can do that.... maby if u have ivf|`|we0xPfYLaa	To be honest I don't know that you can do that other then doing the invitro or how ever you spell it.

a1cMDuDsaa	Hi Gerti!    First of all, no I don't think that you are a terrible mother. I just believe that this isn't the best choice for your baby. Unfortunately the world we live in is filled with judgment, you know this because you endure the prejudice frequently. While it is a beautiful thought to express gay pride, due to the evidence of the cruel world we live in, the naming of your baby shouldn't be a part of that expression. It almost makes your child a symbol, not a person. It is your child and your decision, but I believe that as a parent, you must shelter your child as much as possible, and naming a baby something so controversial in our society like this just isn't fair. Perhaps if you don't like your name, would you be interested in changing your name to something symbolic of your orientation? I believe that is the best option at this point...|`|MQjsspQ6aa	Ok your not being very practical about this look your name is gurtrude and you hate it right well if you name your daughter lesbiana how is that gona be any different than your situation with your name i think you shouldn't call her that because thats a little cruel ok!|`|8D6IbrcTaa	I don't get it, you hate your name but you don't care if your child has a name she hates?  That's so cruel. I understand that your proud of being gay and thats great but your daughter should have a choice if she chooses to be proud when she's old enough to understand.   Don't give her that name, its just fuel for her being bullied, it's cruel.  Rose is much better, let her be normal.|`|frpCK0utaa	I think you are being very selfish yo be honest. I applaud you that you are proud of who you are, that doesn't mean you should feel justified in giving your daughter a ridiculous name.     Just because you dislike your first name, doesnt mean you should do the same to your daughter.|`|AA11617874	Adolescents cannot handle being teased as well as adults. Studies showed that kids with horrible first names didn't do well in life. Why would you want your kid to face that pressure? You despise your name. Don't think about yourself. Let your kid be the first priority.|`|zATQaiwIaa	its one thing to pass on something to your child, but its another to try to force your views on them and make them carry a choice you have made.  I have nothing against lesbians or gays; I have friends of both nature.    Bottom line:  there is no need to pass on YOUR orientation to your daughter; you should let her make her own way in that part of her life.|`|fAIKG9Iyaa	You should not do that because, she will get mad fun of in school!|`|6EIdLkS7aa	"Frankly, I do not give a damn if Lesbiana does not enjoy her name."    This is not a good way to start off your relationship with your daughter.    She is a human child, she is not a vessel for your philosophies of life.    Raising a child is a 100% selfLESS act    And you are behaving selfishly.    I cannot tell if this is a joke to get people riled up or not, but I hope it is :(|`|2YfnzbRnaa	It seems to me that you just want to look for trouble here....But if your question is real, then name your daughter whatever you want it is your kid what do we care about her....Do whatever you want....|`|TE7foNwMaa	I definitely think you're joking. Either this, or you are one sick-minded celebrity wanna-be.     I agree with most of the answers posted. And I do believe that you're setting yourself up for a suicidal child.   Yes, these are your beliefs, and that's absolutely fine. But you can't force them on your daughter. She is her own individual, and is free to make her own choices. You might as well name her Perverta...or maybe Gay. At least that's even a name.     I definitely do not believe you, because I believe that any mother should have instinct enough to love her child. I'm sure you don't want her to kill herself, and even if you don't care rather she enjoys her name or not, it's still extremely cruel and abusive to force this upon a baby. Life isn't easy, and this would not make hers any better.     It is utterly selfish and immature to even consider this kind of name seriously. It screams "teenage mom", while also clearly stating that you obviously don't love your child. And rather you like it or not, this baby could easily (and most likely will) grow up to be quite a rebel... she WILL be able to turn you in, and you WILL have to pay the price for this kind of abuse.     If you would like some serious names to consider (if you even are having a baby), you could try "Lessie" or "Leslie". Or even "Bienna". There are many other subtle options, without having to make a complete fool of yourself... I literally feel embarrassed for you.    Be serious, and be smart. There's a way to be creative without sounding and looking like an absolute idiot. You're not ready to be a parent if you're not going to love your baby more than this. And don't try to get us to feel sorry for you. No, you're not having an abortion, seeing as you have nothing to abort. Nothing but a troll. You knew the answers you would get from this question, but you chose to ask it anyway?? Keep your sexuality, but don't force it on anyone else. Be sympathetic, not everyone is going to find true love the way you did.     I have nothing against lesbians, and actually have a few friends with this lifestyle. It doesn't bother me, that's who they are. But they can't force that on anyone else, and they're mature enough to know that.     -- Amy|`|28WJwHf4aa	Nice.    If I were you, I'd start a savings account immediately, even prior to birth, to cover all of her future psychiatric needs.|`|i1YZ489maa	I think it sounds ok, but I also agree with everyone else that she will most likely be made fun of and that can cause all sorts of emotional problems.  I know you want to show everyone what you believe and I think that's awesome, but is a girl's name the right way to do it (or are you just doing it for a "shock" factor)?  I think being a lesbian/gay is about what you feel, not just to be different than everyone else.  Also, if you hated the name your parents gave you, why don't you legally change it?      It sounds like your mind is made up though, so why are you posting it as a question?  Once again, is it for a "shock" factor?  Or are you really concerned about how people will respond if you name her Lesbiana Rose?  Either way, I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide.|`|AA11265535	I hate the name Lesbiana Rose. Sounds WAY too much like lesbian. Your daughter may not choose to be a lesbian like you have! And she wil get teased ALL through her life! I am for naming people unique names but not that bad!|`|Qm4BKE13aa	1. Your sexual orientation may not be your daughters sexual orientation.  2. I think it is wrong of you not to think of what your daughter will have to live with. and go through because you want to name her something that you are saying she will not enjoy.  3. Abortion at 7 months? Now I KNOW you are crazy, give your daughter up for adoption if you can't bear the thought of your child living with a name different than Lesbiana.  4. And my final thought: If you name your daughter Lesbiana she will grow up sad, depressed and grow to hate you and your partner, and will be saving for a name change until she hits 18 and can legally do it herself. She will probably disown you and you will deserve it. She will also probably be very judgemental towards all gay and lesbian people.|`|rgOBHB5uaa	gorgeous|`|fU4pOpeHaa	i think you should get a fich and name it that and get a real name like what you suggested before Leslie Bridgette Anne. Yeha theres an inside joke but i like that one better than this one.|`|AA12338134	Please! Don't saddle her with that first name! Kids can be merciless on the playground and they will tease her endlessly! In 8th grade, I was teased simply for having the same last name as an eccentric teacher who had taught at that school the year before.|`|tAEmJZCtaa	I can't believe that you want child to get picked on in school. She will definitely get picked on!!! To be honest, I hate it! That's my two cents though.|`|iT0lzQxYaa	I think it is great that you want to share your gay pride with your daughter... but do you have any thoughts about what her orientation might be? She might end up being attracted to men, and thats OK.   Personally, I don't really like the name. It is nothing against lesbians, but I just don't think its fair. She will PROBABLY be made fun of at school... I hope you see were I am coming from, but remember, the decisson is yours! Good luck!|`|15ETCoUZaa	I don't think you should name her that cause of the humiliation you would put yourself and your daughter through. She would probably turn emo with all the kids teasing her.|`|PUn197AAaa	well i do not think u are serious, but if you are then i would say absoloutely not. black people don't name their kids blacka and jewish people do not name their kids jewa|`|wQEVpe7zaa	Hi! No, No, No!!!! She is going to have a terrible time in school with that name. Kids can be really cruel, and let's face it - there are a lot of gay-hating idiots out in the world!|`|d3195d7fc3af4e4e569f9639ba3c6b48aa	I wouldn't do that.   People would make fun of her.  I would also shoot myself if that was my name.  For your daughters own good please don't name her that.|`|vG9VGezbaa	First off, you are setting this poor child's future up for her by insinuating that you are going to force her to be a lesbian. That's a cruel way to punish someone who hasn't done anything.    And the fact that you don't give a damn if she likes her name or not is a good enough reason not to even have a daughter, because you're just not going to care how she feels.    Oh, and the name Gertrude makes me sick!|`|fWq45EOGaa	I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'm not being hateful...I have lesbian friends, but there is no reason to do this to your child. That would be like naming your son ***, or queer. I'm straight and I wouldn't name my child "line" or "straighta". Just because you have a bad name doesn't mean you should punish your child. You should also give a damn that she enjoys her name..what kind of mother would you be? A bad one obviously!|`|8cf465685c48fbb3de5844bd387d758daa	Gee you sound like you are going to be a great mother....yeah right! You know how it feels to hate your name but you don't care how your daughter would feel with that name? What if your daughter doesn't grow up to be a lesbian? You can have gay pride without making your child's childhood a living hell! Think about how she will be made fun of in school! I swear this makes me only believe more that people should have to have a license to have children!! I'm not flying off the handle but my goodness.....you have a lot of growing up to do before that precious baby enters your life.|`|FzgskabOaa	I think you are putting your own Gay Orientation onto your daughter without giving her a choice of her own. You may be Gay and proud of it (which i think is great!) But you have to think of this poor kid at school and her name badge at work etc etc etc... I think if this is something really important to you, maybe go for Rose Lesbiana as a middle name?? I love that you feel so strongly and passionate about your sexuality, but you shouldn't feel like you need to prove yourself. I think kids face enough struggles these days without any added pressure.|`|HN47gKD8aa	r u high   do u want ur child to be a social outcast   Rose would be better not lesbniana unless she is destined to be a lesbian whihc i dont think she would be|`|rqt65s7xaa	I really think you should not name your daughter lesbiana because kids may tease her or harass so I would be very Careful what you name her. My daughters name is Audrey and Charlotte and Joy Anna. Also your daughter may be straight when she grows up she may not be a lesbian.|`|44fdrVIDaa	I think you are going a bit extreme. Even though I respect your sexual orientation, naming your baby Lesbiana is a bad choice. There are soo many names out there. And you don't have to show everybody who you are as long as you are the good person.|`|G1QeNxC1aa	I think it sounds gay.|`|YtkX7u7qaa	Haha ur funny. U should go into comedy! Ud make a lot of money! And then nobody would care what ur kids name is. Problem solved|`|MBHkcmB4aa	Hi look no need to hurt ur self or anyone else. U r saying that u r  a liberal person right! and u agree with choice.

Rose is nice.|`|P5PoskpJaa	wierd, i wouldnt name my kid straighta|`|44OH7Si6aa	That's nice that you feel her name represents your orientation but it isn't your name. What if she's straight? Besides, she'll have rotten self esteem because others will make fun of her all the time and boys will be weired out by the name and she'll get her little heart broken all the time|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think you must be on crack and your mind is skewed|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	I think thats a little disrespectful to your child . You may want to " pass the name on " to her but what if she hates it ? and think of how bad the children will criticize her . but as you said you dont care that your daughts self esteem will be shot down . i think you may want to think a little more . and your the parent but i wouldnt do that to my daughter . you can teach her about it but why name her after YOUR love of gay pride|`|3MVv1uOaaa	it has a good background meaning but i honestly think its a horrible name. its not just a name she wont like, she will get picked on and teased constantly.|`|hej8oelXaa	Its definitely a different name. But also consider how much she is going to be ridiculed at school or other group events. I know that's only a small part of life but it really shapes who you are as a person. Just something to consider. Maybe use it as a middle name, but call her it as a nickname and let her decide when she is older whether she would like to go by her first name or middle name. It can always be legally changed anyways.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	Just name her Moron. She'll more than likely be one with genes like yours.|`|DP48dIxhaa	...its still embarassing..I would shoot myself if that was myyyyyyy name.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	oh my god are you serious?   you are a FREAK. and your daughter will have bad feelings toward you and will most likely change her name.    so you're trying to bring more lesbians into the world or your trying to make your daughter your lesbian lover? i'm confused.    you're disgusting.    i have no problem with gays and lesbians but don't flaunt it like a new style or something...i think most people that claim they're gay want attention.    if i ever met you i would punch you in the mouth.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	Why not switch it...Rose Lesbiana..if you are that set on it. I see you wanting to pass your lifestyle onto her...but she will suffer with that name! She can be loud and proud with you and not have to carry the word in her first name.|`|7c007d90b52d84105c8a22e166229b79aa	Typical lunacy. too bad your mother was not a lesbian. No Gerti, no problem.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	She could be called Lez like Leslie or Rose, or Biana. Um but....r u like lesbian? I dont think I would want my name to be that, I think id change my name like immideatly!!!!!!!!!!!!    sorry i know i am not being nice, but I think you took the time to find a name that represents you and even if she doesnt like it who gives a crap she can use rose. Just, shell learn to live, but she might turn on you and be mean when she gets older and gets teased,     good luck,     ~Heather|`|gu1sEQN8aa	loll I would kill myself if i was her....please please dont|`|TX9igTWraa	i don't like that name. i'm sure there is one that will represent your orientation well. why don't you try to think of a name that means pride or colorful (like the rainbow in gay pride)

My daughters name is Hanna middle name rain but for some reason my WHOLE family likes to call her Hanna Rain, they say they like the sound of it.

PFO1jxZGaa	Well you cant have that time back so instead of worrying about that just enjoy this time so you wont look back in a year and realize that you missed this time too because you were worried about what happened before..   I feel like it took their 'babyhood' for granted too.. My yongest is now 18 mos and I wonder where the time went... When my middle one was 9 mos I got pregnant with my youngest, had a very emotional pregnancy and didnt want to deal with my older two kids, had my yongest and started having bad panick attacks and I was just, not depressed but withdrawn. I snapped out of it about 8 or 9 mos ago and realized I compleatly missed my middleones last year of life... I was so sad for a couple of days but then I realized nothing I can do to change that and since then I have really treid to enjoy every day I have with them and just remember to cherish this moment..|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no youre not being ridiculous at all. Ive ahd you as a contact since we were both pregnant and I at times feel the same. I was stressed out very bad for the 1st 6 weeks of her life bc my bf constantly talked about quitting his job. I vaguely remember a lot of your ?'s about your  husband. With all that you'd been through with him, I think you sound like you're doing a wonderful job with your son and coped very well the first few weeks considering what you'd been through.  But yes, sometimes it makes me sad knowing she my daughter now 6 /12 months will never be that tiny or helpless again, and that she will only get bigger and bigger. Maybe to us we look the same in 7 months but with babies it's like 7 yrs bc they change and develop so fast and quickly. I think even moms who had "perfect" circumstances while pregnant and when their baby was first born feel this way; I think ti's a normal feeling. Esp. with your 1st.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	Having a newborn is a lot of stress.  People tell you that it will be a lot of hard work having a newborn but they don't really get into how it will be.  My son is 20 months old now and I'm due to have another son any day now.  I cried as I was getting out all of the tiny baby clothes because I couldn't believe that my oldest was ever so tiny!  It can be really hard to bond with a newborn.  We are bombarded by pictures of new mom's with happy cooing babies and they don't come out that way.  It takes a few months for them to not just be little crying, pooping and puking things...  Even Angelina Jolie said that it was harder for her to bond with Shiloh then it was to bond with her adopted children because of the fact that she was an infant not a happy cooing baby.  I think that we all go trough it but if you ask me I think that the really sad thing is that we all feel like we must be bad mothers for it so we don't talk about.  I think that you were really brave to say how you are and were feeling.   Thank you!|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	Sounds like you might still be having some post-partum issues if you are crying almost daily and feeling overwhelming guilt & regret. For your sake and your son's, I hope you are getting the help and support you need so that from this moment forward you can love and appreciate him to the best of your abilities. You are right, you can't turn back the clock ... but you can make a fresh start now and let go of the past and do the best you can by your son. Parenting is always fraught with self-doubt, but if you are doing your best there is NOTHING to feel guilty about! So get out, get some fresh air & exercise with your little guy, join some mom & tot classes, and then come home and give him a good snuggle.|`|by7H31Djaa	I felt the same way and still do! Anytime i see newborns i feel sad. I myself can't really remember when he was a newborn either but now he's 15 months old and it just gets better believe me! He comes up tp me and gives me hugs and grabs onto my clothes because he wants to be carried by mommy. His smile is the best smile i can ever get in return the world! I miss being able to swaddle and craddle his little body but now he can give me hugs :o) Something he couldn't before. As they get older they're milestones that you just wait and wait for and when they finally come it's such a blessing. He's just started to grab his play phone and put it to his ear like he's talking. He learned how to climb on the couch and then 2 days later jump off! It's those milestones that slowy ease away your regrets and pains! Good Luck!|`|JQZDCcyQaa	I feel like that and I didnt have post natal, they do grow so fast and I feel as if I cant remember what she was like when she was a newborn, its normal. But you have now and just enjoy every single minute with him.|`|eq59nZJHaa	Aiden is the same age as your little guy, as you know... I have been around every day and have tried my best to tuck away each and every little thing because I know that I'm not going to be having any more babies... I've tried my best to cherish every moment of his and just take it all in so I don't forget... unfortunately even with this concious effort I have a hard time recalling the newborn days and I too cry all too often about both of my kids growing up... I guess what I'm saying is that even without ppd and marital issues, I too am in the same boat as you.  You had one heck of a first few months with your little guy and should stop beating yourself up about the past.  It's not abnormal at all to feel like those early days have faded.    You're a great mom and you obviously know how wonderful it is... keep up the good work and stop beating yourself up...     Next time you get home (or see your little guy) just look at him and say "hi baby" or whatever it is you say that creates this enormous smile... look at that smile and ask yourself if for a second your son seems to feel cheated... He loves you more then anything else in this world!

CD5JsjxKaa	first of all, my heart goes out to you. i'm sorry to hear that you haven't got any results yet. but i have two questions: one, how old are you? age does make a difference. and two: how do you "know" that neither of you are sterile? there really is no way of knowing unless you get a full check-up. even if both of you have had kids before, doesn't mean that you are still fertile now.         anyways, 8 months of trying isn't that long, dear. don't lose heart, and don't don't get stressed out (that'll only decrease your chances) keep a light heart full of hope don't despair. don't worry. when it happens it'll happen.|`|ENopcUHDaa	You need to relax for one, if you keep stressing about it it wont happen. It takes time. I took me and my husband 4 years to get pregnant. So It will come when its meant to be. But relax and enjoy the time with your bf.
NaJPIOheaa	whats up with the rude, insensitive answers? don't listen to them, they're low-life and shallow people. anyways i'd kinda need more information, when was your last period? if you are due to get your period on the 10th, count 14 days before the tenth, so you should be ovulating now, or soon!! alot of gals time ovulation at the wrong times, thinking you ovulate 14 days AFTER your first day of your period, that's false! i encoded the website i use below and it works great! also you could try some OPK's(ovulation predictor kits) that will tell you when your ovulating. i'd recommend a book called 'taking charge of your fertility', its GREAT! good luck xo    http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/login.jsp|`|NvoHMxQcaa	You have to know when you ovulate before you can determine your luteal phase.|`|AA10172823	The only way to conceive a baby... is to eat one.|`|XhdqONLCaa	remember the law of gravity, what goes up will go back down also.|`|R2TnvAbfaa	You have to know (on average) what day you ovulate during your cycle before you can determine the length of your luteal phase.  You should use ovulation predictor kits.  When you get a positive, then you'll ovulate within the next 36 hours.  Count from the time you ovulate until your period starts and that's your luteal phase.
RrPjG9x9aa	you need to figure out when you ovulate.  google "cervical mucus", "opk's", and "bbt", and you'll be on the right track.  forget about your luteal phase and when your period comes and all that....the key is pinpointing ovulation.|`|6igjX2cnaa	depends on when u ovulate hun.  The days from ovulation till your period is your luteal phase.  You can find out when u ovulate by ovulation predictor kits and paying atten. to your cervical fluid.  When your cervical fluid is wet and really stretchy you are ovulating.  best wishes hun :)|`|UXRwYHrMaa	If you are desperately trying to conceive you should not guess. You should figure out how to actually track your fertility and then know your ovulation and luteal phase length *for certain*    Buy, borrow or check out the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" (avail on amazon.com) and it will explain everything. My DH and I used fertility tracking as birth control for 1.5 years before we decided to conceive. Then we just switched to actively trying to have sex when we knew I was ovulating. We conceived on our first try.    Essentially it will teach you how to understand your cervical mucus (discharge), your waking temperature, and your cervical position. Between these three things, you can tell with certainty when you ovulate. You can generally tell this a few days in advance, and can therefore start having sex just when you should to maximize chances of conceiving.     Because to conceive what you really want to know is your ovulation, not your luteal phase. Once you hit your luteal phase it is too late to have sex to try to conceive. Your luteal phase is always stable from one cycle to the next (mine is 16 days), but the first phase of your cycle, from the onset of your period until ovulation, can vary widely. Even if you think of yourself as very regular, some cycles will be different. I considered myself very regular, but over the 1.5 years I was tracking, I was a low as 28 days and as high as 35 days, with an average of 31.      So knowing that I had a luteal phase of 16 days would not have helped at all predict exactly when we should have been having sex to maximize chances of conception. But by watching for stretching egg white cervical mucus, looking for a dip and then raise in my temperature, and feeling for a soft and open cervix, we could know exactly when I would ovulate.
kVBDpAMTaa	It sounds like you may be pregnant. I got terrible headaches in early pregnancy, the rise in hormones is the cause of that. And you will notice a slight increase in discharge, and that will increase more as you get farther along due to all the stretching and the uterus growing.    I also cramped really bad with "period like" cramps but I never started my period. I had those cramps up until my 4th month and now I still randomly get them but not half as much.

It's a workhorse!  I use it several times daily, and have breastfed all my children past the one year mark.  You can purchase adapters for the car, or a battery pack.  It keeps the milk cold for several hours, and the pieces are all easily replacable at baby stores or on-line.  I did have an Avent manual to start with, and it is complete junk.  You can buy the units on E-bay relatively inexpensively and just purchase new collection shields, tubes, and membranes at Babies R Us for $20.  If you are going to be pumping a lot, I would definitely recommend it.  Good luck to you.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Medela Pump In Style was great for me...

RQvLrKMXaa	Picky eating is developed and encouraged by parents by not requiring their children to eat what is good for them and allowing them to eat what they want or like, which normally will consist of foods high in sugar.  Do your child a favor and teach them to eat what is presented to them, not what they choose to eat.|`|UAunAKdtaa	gerber has some awesome finger snacks your kid might like.  my son likes apple fries (you take an ordinary apple, peel, cut in half,then slice french fry style and serve by themselves or with some table cream (aka ketchup)) my little sister adored veggies cut in different shapes all layed out in like a picture...takes some time and imagination, but its worth it. make sure not to add so much sugar to things. your child will like to copy you, since they take parents as their hero. so do some exercise daily, (maybe dance and clap hands), eat healthy (reduce coffee and sweetened drinks and ice cream)  your child will love it of you pour some of your apple juice out of YOUR cup to hers.give her her own dish and sit down to eat with her. soon she will be saying "i'll have what she's having"  try slicing string cheese, bananas, apple fries and putting some whole grain cookies on her plate during snack. they think of food as a play material, so think like a kid in this one. would you like a plate of boiled vegetables and boring chicken soup or  a zoo adventure where even chicken soup has stars?    PS and if youu're really worried about her food habits, try talking to a dietician or sneaking in some pediasure into her cup every once in a while!|`|6vS8SZemaa	I would try Different snacks..

My wife says you have to eat something 10 time to develop taste for it.  hope that helps.|`|KATfddVRaa	I disagree with the first answerer its not necessarily your fault, my daughter is 14 mons and is the same way, and I was told by two pediatricians not to force her to eat things she doesn't want or she will learn to resent mealtime. What i do is only offer healthy choices, and even though she'll choose one or two every time i try to sneak other things into those choices. I also give her a prescription multivitamin as well as toddler formula at bedtime. I really hope she eats better soon though!

UXRwYHrMaa	In general you do not ovulate during your period, and even if your body somehow accidentally released an egg during your period (which would be rare and unlikely because of how hormones coordinate the whole process) it would be unlikely to successfully implant because the lining was being shed.    Typically when people have sex shortly after their period and conceive it is because the sperm can remain viable inside a woman for up to five days after sex. So if she ovulates at any period during those next five days she could conceive.    The standard fertility cycle assumes that a woman ovulates 14 days after her period *begins* but I have had cycles where I ovulated 10 days after it begins. So it would look like this: Days1-5 have period, Day 6 have sex, Days 7-10 Sperm still hanging around, Day 10 ovulate. In that scenario you could get pregnant from having sex the day after your period.    Dont be too confused. If you are trying to get pregnant you can try to look up natural means to track your ovulation cycles, you can purchase kits that will help test for when you are ovulating, or you can do it the old fashioned way and have sex every other day from the time your period ends until when it begins again. I happen to think  3 is the most fun way anyways :)|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	it can happen!! I have a 3yo son to prove it.|`|3w7VztEWaa	wow i really needed to hear that.

What you should do is if you can remember the first day of your last period, go into this website:    http://www.bubhub.com.au/info-ovulation-...    and enter in the first day of your last period, and if you had sex on the day or in between the days it gives you then your chances are higher.    But just take a test when your period is due aswel.    Good Luck|`|ybFZdsKdaa	Pregnancy Test: $5  Find somewhere discreet to take the test, and wait for results.  Stress can delay a woman's period.  If positive: Congrats  If Negative: Better luck next time... kids are awesome.
1SGl03Zlaa	I go to swimming lessons with my 18 month old and its mostly just singing songs.  For jumping into the pool they sing jack and jill or humpty dumpty (kids jump in when humpty "has a great fall" and when "jack fell down".  back floats they have baby put their head on parents shoulder and sing twinkle twinkle (they also sing this for front floats)  They sing the grand old duke of york and we lift baby up when they sing up and down when they sing down  They sing a "fishy wishy" version of the hokey pokey.  You put your left and right "fins" in instead of arms and "flippers" instead of feet and "bubbler" instead of mouth and then you do the "fishy wishy" (wiggle back and forth) and turn your self around.    At the end we sing ring around the rosie and all walk in a circle the first time around they sing we all go under (parents blow in babies face before dunking them under the water) and the second time they sing we all say goodbye.  There is also a song called "mr bubble in the tubble" that they sing to get the babies to blow bubbles in the water, but I don't know all the lyrics for it yet.  Other than all the songs they usually let the kids all get a toy to play with and we encourage the kids to throw the toy and go swim to it (with parents holding them of course).|`|aLAmvX5Naa	When I took my daughter to swim class at that age they mostly just sang songs and danced with the babies.     Why not take some popular nursery rhymes/songs and make them about those things?    This is the way we float on our back, float on our back, float on our back. This is the way we float on our back safely in the pool.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I actuall just started them here in australia - i am not a teacher but here is what we did - we sang songs and put the babies under, or their faces - we sat them on the wall and put our arms out and caught them in the water - we held them on their backs and kinda floated them.  we held them on their bellies and had them facing us and had our chins level with theirs and blew bubbles in the water.  When we had to put them under, we hold them on their belly - say 1 2 3 then blow on their face and put their face under - and then when they come out we make a big deal out of it etc.    we also were shown how to make them hold onto the wall - sit them on the wall facing you and then say "hum,pty dumpty had a great fall" and then pull them into the water, turn them around and have them reach and hold onto the wall - to simulate if they fall in, they can turn and hold the wall for support.    Hope i have helped.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	I'm hoping to take a mom/baby swim class when my daughter turns 6 months (the age they require at my center)    It would be cool if there were any songs/games that we could do to make those activities easier?

She is 8 weeks old and has been doing this for a while.  It kind of concerned me at first, but she doesn't seem sick.  I am curious to see what others say, but if you are really worried you might ask your ped.|`|AA11920812	Generally, a cough in a newborn is uncommon. And, you should take her to your doctors for a look. But, once a day...just seems kind of strange. Are you sure its just once? Not a sign of asthama though.     At this age they should not be coughing. Usually a sign of a virus (noro or roto) common colds to you and I but very dangerous for newborns. A cough is an indication of a breathing problem at this young age. And, breathing problems are common with these viruses.    I don`t want to scare you because as I mother I know its already scary!! Especially if she is your first. I just want you to be aware of what is out there. Keep an eye on it. If you notice anything different take her in right away. You probably already have her one month appt already made mention it then as well,    If you are really worried call your local hospital and ask to speak with a nurse. Usually there are designated nurse lines just for this purpose. They will be of great help!! At least they were with my two babes, and still are.    You can always run a dehumidifer (a cool mist). See if that doesn`t help. If you notice the cough itself as a dry cough or wet cough or barking cough that is more telling. :))|`|AA11637178	No it is not a sign of asthma. She might have a slight allergy (if that). She's just getting a tickle. Think how often do you cough?|`|LABC73E7aa	take her to the peditirician but i dont think 1 cough a day is a sign of asthma.
mgEs4nK5aa	Personally and professionally I dont really know, though I would assume that as long as you are seeing a doctor he/she will tell you if something is or could be wrong.    But I do know of someone who worked at the bowling alley down the street from me that was nicknamed "String Bean" (she named herself lol) because she was very thin and she stayed that size all the way through her pregnancy and she had a regular sized baby that was very healthy. So I think you should be fine with your size, honestly its the baby's size that the real issue and since your doctor hasnt said to you that he/she isn't growing right you should be alright.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	I'm 25 weeks and I'm very tiny still but as long as your baby is completely healthy there isn't any problem.

T6nmD3X9aa	if you make an issue out of it then sure! My mom & I just got into an arguement if adultery is illegal (not immoral or anything, just against the law) and we found out in many states - IT IS!!! I could not believe it! No one ever prosecutes it anymore, but you can make an issue out of it and maybe it will happen to spare the company from embarassment....but you will also have to consider it may backfire and can be harrassment on your part!   Is he a lawyer?? Then yes, I would let everyone know. Take out an ad in the newspaper...what a turd.    EDIT: I was reading some of the answers  & I know for SURE it is against the law in the military for a serviceman (or woman) to commit adultery. My husband was in the marines for years...they are very strict.    Good luck to you, I hope you find peace....|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No. What he does on his spare time is his bussiness.

I can't imagine what you're like at home. Probably a jealous $%@&(. You probably don't even know for a fact he cheated on you and you "wanna get back at him" even though he probably didn't do it. And even if he did, like I said I can see why.
0qP8gLpyaa	My husband and I travel with our little guy who is a toddler almost 2 years old frequently.  When we stay at hotels we do the following:    1. Ask for a baby crib when you check in. You can put them anywhere you want in the room. We usually take a blanket from home and a set of our sons own sheets to use so it is more familiar to him.  Take a lovey and a couple favorite toys that don't have alot of pieces or that make too much noise. Remember- other people sleep in hotels too! It also helps to request a room on a lower level floor. This way if she gets to running around in the room it won't bother people below you. If there aren't any cribs available you could turn a couch in the room towards the wall so the back is facing out and the open side is against the wall. Use your own blanket from home and a pillow plus a couple stuffed animals and let her bunk down there.    2. Take plenty of juice boxes/ milk, sippy cups and toddler snacks that are healthy. Get that room fridge stocked up with what you bring because you'll need it! Don't forget some toddler bowls and spoons as well if needed. I just toss those into a zip bag and the snack stuff into a separate zip bag.  I pick up a small thing of juice boxes and a 1/2 gallon of milk for a weekend trip and it works well.    3. Plan to arrive early in the day.  This way the kids can play and if a nap is needed, the older child can play quietly or go do something with dad while the other one naps a couple hours.  Try to find a hotel with an indoor pool and take swim stuff. Our little guy LOVES to go splash in the pool and play when we can. It also wears them out for bedtime later!    4. Dinner- if your hotel offers it, splurge for room service or call for carry out and pick it up in the lobby so you don't have to hassle with restaraunt crowds or worry about a toddler who may be getting tired or fussy towards the end of their day. It's a life saver.  Take advantage of in house breakfast buffets and things as well if offered. It saves you money and they are usually kid friendly.     5. Keep bedtime routine as close as possible. Keep noise in the room quieter until little one falls asleep.  When we travel with our son I usually get him bathed, a snack and story, brush teeth about 30 minutes after dinner. This way he do some quiet type play and wind down for a little bit before bed.  Don't be surprised if excitement takes over and bed time gets bumped a bit. It will be OK.  It happens. Usually my son is in bed at 8:00 every night, but on special trips we blow it off and let him stay up an extra hour if he's really excited.  He will usually fall asleep and nap a little extra the next day but it's not that big of deal for something special.     6. See if your hotel has game rental or movie rental available. Find a family fun flick and enjoy.  Ask at the desk when you check in about area attractions or see if they have a local attractions brochure area that you could find something to go do as a family that is close by.|`|HyknHVV5aa	An idea is to bring along those safety mesh bed rails and you could get a 2 bed hotel room, you and your husband have one bed, your son have the other, and your daughter get a cot and put the rails on both sides of the cot. Then it's like her very own bed, and she has the rails so she won't fall off it!|`|I7rh95Dkaa	just from previous experience...get her to get used to her bed , by putting toys in there, let her think of it as a fun place she likes to be so she'll begin to get more and more comfortable with it....or you can play with her until she gets tire and restful then place her in the center of bed.... as for climbing out or falling off( if shes in a big  bed line pilllows around the bed or around her)|`|DVB8XhCBaa	Well...    Buy 2 feet thick wood parts and put it over your door.    Then get titanium bars and attach it to the crib. Make sure they are up to 3 feet long.      Now you (and the hotel) are safe =)|`|49We7buoaa	I'd take along her own pillow and blankets, maybe her favorite movie or stuffed animal..... Maybe before you plan the trip insted of putting her down for a nap in her bed try putting her in you & hubby's with her pillow and blankets like you would on thr trip so she can kind of get use to not sleeping in her bed and sleeping in a big bed, then a few days later try laying down with her so she can get use to someone else in the bed with her..... Good Luck I hope this helped, and I hope you get your vacation soon|`|4pGwan5vaa	My son was like that the first time i stayed with him in a Hotel. He was about the same age with the same circumstances. I'm an only father too so there was no help.  The only thing i can say is to try to make her day as active as possible. follow your normal bedtime routine then try something to make it fun. for example make her a tent out of the blankets on the floor and make it where she can sleep in it. that s what worked for me.

AA11764194	slight cramping is very normal it is because your uterus is stretching because of the growing baby..     don't worry.. if it too painful then talk to your Doc otherwise don't over do anything, take it easy..
MtKqi5VBaa	No problem. My baby is the same way. At 11 months I'll give her a 3 course dinner: some soup, a mash of veggies and meat and some berries for dessert. The entire thing is gone in about 15 minutes and she doesn't stop screaming until she's halfway done with course  2. It's very nerve racking considering the fact that she holds in to the bowl for dear life and constantly inspects how much food is left.   I guess baby girl just loves to eat!  I was like that as a baby too.|`|A9j7ahwsaa	does he only eat when he's hungry? or will he eat even when full? its normal if he  acts that way because he's hungry, but babies usually stop eating, even refuse food if they are full, have a doctor check him out for prada-willy syndrome, i think thats how its spelt. only you know your baby, if you're worried seek professional help.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	it's normal he is just growing|`|aT7HgLJnaa	It's normal. Just means he's hungry and in his opinion you're not feeding him fast enough. have you tried letting him feed himself yet? and always go by their hunger cues- they know when they're full.

5aKUV5afaa	I agree.  And I don't think it's only in the Newborn section.  I chalk it up as a bunch of kids, that because of their youth, simply don't know anything.  I mean really, who wants advice on rearing children or career advice from a 14 year old?  So these children go from answer to answer, in every category doing thumbs down on things they simply don't understand.  I pay no attention to them.  It's part of their learning experience.  As you should know, arguing or trying to explain things to teenagers is like trying to beat a hole in the floor with your own head!  Move on and ignore the children.|`|remZ5gDUaa	Oh hell yea I agree with you. My husband is always telling me to stay off here cuz I get so pissed sometimes.

UJaCObdyaa	I am an Aussie as well and I love you name choices.    Angus Mathew - gorgeous, nice, strong and manly.  I know of 3 boys named angus and I think it is a typical aussie name.    Matilda Eden - another gorgeous name.  Heath Ledger's daughter is Matilda.  It is probably another typical aussie name and it is absolutely beautiful.    BTW - Wasn't Angus Scott in ACDC?  Maybe I am showing my age now lol.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	I like Eden, but not Matilda. It's one of the only names I can actually say that I hate. It just sounds like a bunch of harsh consonants smushed together and isn't very pretty.     Angus sounds like a very old, very cross man- the type that chases children off his property with a wooden stick. Matthew is a little bit filler as a first or middle name.    All in all, not a fan of either. There are much nicer names out there, that are equally "different".    If you'd like more suggestions, try this site: http://www.nymbler.com/    Good luck!  ? Q???|`|i98X99Q8aa	Matilda Eden is a beautiful name without being too silly. Good choice!    Honestly, I think the name Angus will get the boy teased.

Matilda is beautiful and, in my opinion, an under-estimated name. Perhaps you'd like other middle names, such as:  Matilda Peyton, Matilda Elizabeth, Matilda Ellie, Matilda Logan, Matilda Ryan, Matilda Dylan, Matilda Leah, Matilda Brinney, Matilda LeeAndra, Matilda Dawn, Matilda Jordyn, Matilda Lacy, Matilda Miana (pronounced MY-ANN-UH), Matilda Chereese, Matilda LaShae, Matilda DeVon, etc.    Angus Matthew is different, like you wanted, however I think it may be another name kids would make fun of in the future. Most people associate it with angus beef, and you don't want that =(. I'm not good on unique boy names, but maybe you can try names like:  Jordan Matthew, Gavin Matthew, Josiah Matthew, Alek Matthew, Devin Matthew, McKenna Matthew, Liam Matthew, Matthew Lorne, Jarrett Matthew, Matthew Cole, Caleb Matthew, Isaiah Matthew, Matthew Heath, Matthew Tyler, Matthew Parker, Matthew Cooper, Bronx Matthew, etc.    I hope I helped, but if you decide to keep the names you picked out then that's ultimately your choice. Good luck! =)|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I say name your baby what you want within reason..  Remember that they have to live with it forever but I think that everyone at some point in their lives hate their name...  Remember to look at their innitals...  I know someone that went with really nice family names and never realized that the innitals were DAM....  My sister wanted to name her baby Madison Amy and her last name started with a C...  My sister changed her mind because she was worried that if the baby got chubby as she got older she didn't want her to be called Big MAC....   I ask my husband about new names and see how bad he can make fun of it before I say if I like it or not.... Also for us we like names that can have shorter forms.. like Sam for Samuel...   I also go to http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/  you can look up how popular a name has been and where it ranks..  I love it because when I was born mom and dad picked Amy because they didn't know any Amy's and guess what... with in 3 years it was in like the top 5..  There was always at least 2 of us in the classroom at school.|`|r8ETcmHMaa	We have a movie here in the states, called "Matilda" and I believe her father's name was Angus. I like Matilda Eden, but Angus, not so much. Good Luck!|`|87WOSjwgaa	Well my answer was different before I found out you werent from the US. At any rate I thot of Angus beef too or Angus is used for fat kids in movies. And Matilda reminds me of a bratty little one. But they are your babies and you can name them whatever you please. Congrats on the baby!!|`|ZWfztGfXaa	matilda is a nice name but not angus|`|ar2So81eaa	Any names seem okay these days. And no matter what you pick, someone will complain. Don't worry about what other people think.    However, Matilda is not so bad. She could always go by Mattie. I would steer away from Angus though. Matthew is nice though.|`|bYoGeKUUaa	i personally don't like them.  they ARE  weird|`|DhQ58q44aa	For the girl, how about Maddie Matilda?  For the boy, Austin Matthew?|`|5kDQLFhraa	all i can think of is angus beef..|`|yzULbPLgaa	I like your girl name it is really cute. The boy name I asked my kids and they say it makes them think of a Burger. I thought of worse things that he might be called.|`|XIP7jDSPaa	eh, those are okay names.  everyone has different oppinions.  i like the name annalisha, summer, or april for girls names and josh, cody, or austin for boys names.  whatever name you feel good with you should name him/her.  its your baby and it will grow to love its name in no time :]|`|NL48d5lxaa	i like ur names ^_^  Some other good ones are...  Girl:Dallas,Skyler,London  Boy:Schuyler,Lane,Jonas|`|IuEro9Xnaa	i like matilda, it sounds sophisticated, and fancy yet exciting.  hm, well i dont like the name angus . reminds me of an organ.  matthew is another nice name though.|`|o1F8H3Y7aa	Angus will remind everybody of steak.  and matilda will remind people of the unfortunate little girl in that book.|`|vGcuw5Eaaa	I like Angus Matilda and Eden Matthew.|`|Elxuvon8aa	angus to me is a breed of big black cattle sorry no go|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Angus... sounds like beef lol. But it's kinda cute. Rayleigh Erin is a cute girl name I think. And I don't know about of people with that name. But for a boy, I like Tyler Joseph.|`|AA11490722	both great names and not too common either    Tilly as a nickname for Matilda is very cute.|`|RrPjG9x9aa	I'm not a fan of either, but it's your little bundle:)  Matilda is ok, I guess, but try to find something besdies Angus.......makes you think of a slab of beef!
zwctZ812aa	1.  I got the lansinoh cream and nursing pads at Target, but the targets where I live don't care nursing bras in stock.  I got mine at JCPenneys, but the other stuff at Target and Walmart.  I ordered another nursing bra from target online and I am happy with it.  I noticed they also had some at the Baby Depot (in Burlington Coat Factory) when I was there the other day.  As others stated, you can als try motherhood or other maternity stores.      2.  I have never liked the vinegar.  If you want to give it a try, try 1/3 vinegar, 2/3 water.  I usually just use hot soapy water for my son's toys, but when I worked at a Boys and Girls Club we did a big bucket of warm water with 1/4 cup of clorox bleach in it.  We soaked the toys in the bucket, rinsed them, took them out and let them dry.  It worked great and we knew they were sanitary that way.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	The products can be found at walmart or target and they are a lot cheaper there than babiesrus.    I found a great bra at Motherhood. It was a little pricey ($30) but I am thankful that I got it because I haven't found another one that I have been happy with since.    A tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water is just as effective.Yes you can do it in your sink. You soke for 30minutes then rinse and let dry completely. Only hard plastic toys though. You will find that most of the other fabric toys can be machine washed and dried on low now.      *EDIT  OMG Hannah's mommy I can't believe we answered the same at almost the same time!! hahaha|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Lansinoh u can find at Wal-Mart and Target...the pads and creams; nursing bras also.    Toys?  There's nothing wrong with soap and hot water.  It does the trick for mine.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	1. lansinoh cream is sold at our target and walmart, thats the cheapest place i know of. and the best good quality nursing bras i found at motherhood. price ranges from 9.99-39.00 i usually tried them on but if you dont have a store near you you can also buy online at www.motherhood.com    2. I have heard of vinegar and yes you had about half water, but i didnt really think it worked well. With my daughters toys i did exactly what daycares do. They use like 1/4 cup clorox in a big bucket of water.(or sink doesnt matter) and that always seem to work, and things that were machine washable i just tossed them in the washing machine with dreft or something like that.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	walmart works for me, i buy my nursing pads and lansinoh cream there too.  i can't remember where i bought my nursing bras.    for cleaning his toys, i just use soap and water.  it seems to work good.|`|AA11920812	1. I bought them all at Target. The best trick my nurse taught me was to put the lansioh directly on the nursing pad. This way I wasn`t rubbing an already tender part. My fave was either the premedicated lansinoh (those are pretty pricey though) or the Gerber. I have to say the Gerber shaped ones are the ones I still have in my closet ready for a new baby...one day.     2. I just through them in some bleachy water with Dawn. About a capful of bleach to a sinkful of water and a nice squirt of Dawn to make all sudsy. I also use Clorox Wipes for easy cleaning. Especially if someone has a runny nose...when they were younger I`d even use the sanitize cycle on my dishwaser.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	My Nephew hit the "NO" stage right before he turned 2 and he knew what no ment and when he said it he ment it! At first the corner was working but then it began to not phase him. Finally his parents resorted to rubbing their finger in mustard and rubbing it on his toung everytime he said no! Needless to say it stopped quickly!     Whatever you do make sure you are reenforcing to your daughter that even after he punishment she is still going to do what you asked her to do before the punishment. That way she's not just taking the punishment inorder to get out of doing something she didn't want to do in the first place!     Good luck...My Nephew is now 3 and his parents call it the "horrible 3's"!|`|9hLEo32Iaa	I crack mine right in the mouth.  Serves em' right!|`|0cBEbHlHaa	stubborn baby u have...but i agree with da slap on da hand...its not spanking at least...n its jst a stage of bein a baby she'll get over it sooner or later|`|xZo4wP6Faa	mine is 2 and screams no to everything i say to her. EVERYTHING. she is trying me, and i know it. i just keep strong with the time outs. i try not to spank her, but it happens about once or twice a week-not horribly, and only after 10+ time outs. yes, it gets that bad at my house. this is why i use time out, and not spanking 85% of the time.  just stay steady and strong with it. i feel for you. it will pass... that's what they keep telling me anyways.|`|EWJv8Jh7aa	If you haven't yet, get down to her level - whether it is kneeling on the floor or setting her up on your lap - get to where you can make eye contact and have her attention. Speak with her - not to her, assure her that you love her, but her behavior is unacceptable or in 3 year old lingo - not nice - explain that when she does what she is doing something will happen such as a time out, remain consistent with  communication, love, and consequence.    When my little girl won't pick up her toys, her toys go to "time out", I explain why, and then tell her that she can have them back either after a certain amount of time, or after she has picked up the rest of her toys.  While explaining these things I hug her or hold her hands while looking into her eyes, speaking with her, again not to her, and she understands, and 99% of the time she does what she has been asked (sometimes, she is just tired and crabby and just needs a nap).  Every choice has a consequence, and children will learn this over time, and will become better for it.  I will be the first to say that it is not always easy, but to show your children that you love them and that your not just being a bully is so important.  Spanking is not necessary. Children will listen and learn.  Remember communication, love, and consistency.  Good luck!  Don't forget a child's future is worth working for, even when it gets hard.  Motherhood is hard, but Mothers can do hard things!|`|jOJYuv7Taa	Do you say No a lot yourself to her??  Children mimic a lot of what their parents do.  You may also be more loud than you mean to at times so she is also picking up on that.  At this age power struggles are absolutely normal.  They are trying to learn their place.|`|Vf0bmaVGaa	You know time outs aren't working for her and you don't want to use corporal punishment on a 3 year old. That would encourage her to violent behaviour at a later time. If I were three I think a good punishment that might register is to start making those things that seem a horrible thing a happy thought. Let's see if I thought picking up my toys were a bad thing then some things my parents might do is make it into a game to see who could put away the most toys the fastest or perhaps you will read to her a sing her favorite song like twinkle twinkle little star if she helps to pick up her room or you could tell her there is a surprise for her once she gets those toys picked up! It isn't rocket science but you are smarter than her, the advantage she has on you is that she gets more sleep than you do and she has a much less challenging schedule so your energy level is low. If you know in advance what you are going to try the next time you need to defuse the situation then you won't be caught off guard.     This is called redirection, get her to focus on something fun or positive as opposed to making your request negative. It will take a little creativity but it is well worth it to raise your child in a nonviolent home. Give her lots of hugs and constantly remind her "I love you!" She will love you forever.  I wish you well.|`|p0prrzf2aa	obviously they don't work huh. how about a slap on the hand if you don't wanna spank      if you don't disepline your kids they'll turn out to be BRATS|`|HyknHVV5aa	I've recommended this book to all my friends with kids and everyone, including myself, love it. It has great discipline ideas that do not involve spanking or anything, you should definitely buy it and give it a read! It will do wonders!     http://www.amazon.com/1-2-3-Magic-Effect...|`|hGmq5IuZaa	keep putting her in time out ..she will get it ..Consistancy works ..Tell her to use her inside voice. When my children refuse to pick up toys ..I get out a trash bag ..I start filling it up ..they scream in horror and get to cleaning up the toys|`|87WOSjwgaa	My 3 year old step daughter was doing this and nothing would work. I finally resorted to flicking her in the mouth. Not very hard. It got the point across. Then we had a talk about why that is not appropriate and havent had troubles since!|`|6tHA0QQXaa	Since you do not spank,that is why she acts that way.because in her mind she has nothing to fear from you.The second way to handle an honery child,is to threaten to take away the things that they enjoy.What does she like?  If it is dolls you say" Well since you told me no,then you cannot have that doll that you wanted in the store"  See how that works out
Wjdpm4xNaa	I always do this too....I love smelling my baby...even when he's stinky I stll LOVE his smell.  His little feet get stinky too, i have no idea how but i love smelling them lol....and I absolutely love the way his breath smells haha....its the cutest thing to me.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I do it too!! There's something comforting about it :) you're not a freak, just a mummy who loves her baby!|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL, no, you're not a freak.    I still do this with my son and he's almost 10 months old.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Lol I love the new baby smell too. Their heads are always so soft and warm! My husband used to take big, deep inhales of our son's head when he was a newborn lol. He used to do it several times a day because he loved how he smelled.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I sniff my baby every day. All the time. Gosh, she smells great! lol    We just started giving her a bath every day but she always has this faint smell of milk on her and whatever else the smell is.. It's intoxicating. Alrighty I'm officially weird lol|`|zwctZ812aa	I don't blame you, look at all the hair your little one has!! All the more to allow the smell of baby shampoo to linger! lol My son is nearly bald, but I still smell his head and kiss it all the time.  I just love the smell of a baby's head!|`|iOqmoIrcaa	I have always said that when I die, the last conscious thought I will have is the smell of my newborn son.  Babies and puppies have a scent all their own.  If we could bottle it, we'd be millionaires.  All mothers do this, whether they realize it or not.|`|MtKqi5VBaa	You're not a freak. You're a mommy. I LOVE the smell of my daughter's head. It's the best. I sleep with one of her blankets. Who's the freak now?  Baby smell is just amazing. When she was really little and strictly breastfed, I'd even like the smell of her poop. When we first brought  her home from the hospital and took off her little hat that they put on her, I smelled it, and literally shuddered, that's how good it smelled.     So I guess I'm a bigger freak. Enjoy those sweet smells. They don't last forever...  (but then you can just have another baby! lol)|`|kRui5wGtaa	OMG that is so weird. lol    I do that to my son ALL the time...even when all the baby product smell has worn off...just the smell of HIM is so satisfying to me .....Oh God do I love him! I'm going to go smell him hahah    EDIT, I just re-read my answer and it looked as if I was saying that it is so weird that you smell your baby's head....lol...I meant that is so weird that I am not the only one that does it! hahah|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Aww no you're not a freak!  :)  I did it constantly!  I still do, since she is just over two and still smells wonderful.  Even her breath still smells amazing!  LOL!    **ROFL Fleur I do that to every baby I hold too!!  They are so tiny and lovely!  :)|`|AA11920812	Oh yes the newborn smell!    I not only remember the smell but also that fuzzy hair. It was so fine and dark. Like silk. Not that I miss having babies or anything, lol.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Hahaha, I do the same thing too, my family wasn't a bunch of lovey dovy people growing up, I don't think I've ever hugged my parents so I want to make sure Amber will get into it and the kisses and the I love yous and I feel like that doing this is just a start lol    and why did Isabels (sorry if I spelt it wrong) mom get a thumbs down? People are weird they don't see a good thing when they read it!|`|dOEnB1AVaa	No you are not.  I loved smelling my daughter when she was a baby all baby's have that nice smell you cant resist.  After all you are allowed to smell your work of art NO!?|`|EHY3FnAmaa	No your not a freak. I love how my son smells!|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	ME TOO!!!!    (edit: why do i get a thumbs down for smelling my babys head and kissing her??? i really don't get it. whoever did that is just jealous)|`|Lnpqs5lHaa	haha.. no.    I use to smell my nephews & baby's head too. The smell of baby johnsons smells really good. LOL|`|4qrH4pVraa	course you're not a freak! You're a mummy who lurrrrrrrrrrrrrves her baby :)|`|2jnpvyzaaa	this is love @ first sight.i have that kind|`|0VUZacRTaa	I am the same way with my daughter. I kiss her and smell her all the time. You are not alone hun|`|vrHeGvy2aa	I miss that newborn baby smell so much.  I smelled my babies.  I even smell other people's babies...lol!|`|52U22fiAaa	I know, I do it too.... take it ALL in before she grows up :)|`|PjPpdWJyaa	lol your not a freak, I smell my new nephews head all the time, and im sure once my twins are born i will do it to them too, they smell so good after a bath.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Of course your not a freak, I would think you were weird if you didnt want to smell her and be in awe or her. I love babies smell. I sometimes think I could eat my daughter she looks so darn cute!! I just want to hug her so tightly she will pop. I say that to her " Oh your so gorgeous I could just eat you all up"    Lol I just remembered when a client of mine bought her baby in and I just automatically went up to her daughter and smelt her head, I didnt even think about, she might have thought I was weird|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	lol yep, we all do it.. even if we dont realize it, its subconsciously done as well.  A study was done and 9 out of 10 moms could recognize their babies scents from other babies while blindfolded.. kinda cool.  And when the study was reversed the babies recognized their mothers smell as well.  Its funny my son will be 6 this year and i often take a big whiff of him just out of habit.. its not as pleasant anymore!! haha|`|Hf9snNyzaa	I do this to my son also! I love his smell and I get teary eyed because im sooo happy being his mom!|`|AQn5sTXraa	Sometimes I start bawling just looking at my daughter. It's very awe-inspiring to know you created this little being. It's not like you are smelling her diaper....:)
VR9KhbEgaa	Sounds normal to me! I put my 3 mth old to bed by 9:30 every night. My older kids, ages 14 months to 9 years, all go down at 8:30.|`|AA11920812	AW! Your daughter is so precious! Congrats!    I had two very different boys at that age. My oldest wouldn`t go to bed or have his last feeding until 11:30 or midnight. He`d get up at 5 am. BUT my youngest could go to bed earlier and wake up later. Crazy kiddos. They are opposites now the one who liked to go to bed later is now the one who sleeps in. The one who loved to sleep now wakes up at the CRACK of dawn.     And, I friends, am not a morning person. lol. But, good thing is that they are forgiving.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	Whatever schedule that they develop on their own and you are okay with is just fine right now. I know many many parents that put their children ages 1-4 down at those times.    I wanted my daughter in bed by 8 every night and she just happened to fall into that schedule.  She is usually tired and cranky around 6:30 and I give her a bath, by the time she gets that done and I nurse her she is ready to go to bed at 7:30.    Whatever works for you is just fine.|`|dOEnB1AVaa	At first my daughter used to go to sleep exactly like yours then after a while she settle to sleep from 7 pm to 7 am but gave me a full day! She used to have an early nap then that's all. But at least she always gave us a full night sleep.  Now she is almost 8 and has to be in bed by 9 watching cartoons and then by 10pm everything off and she goes to sleep.  Try a different routine and see how she reacts the day after.  Its just trial and error until you find the wright one for you just don't give up.|`|9X09kM4oaa	It just depends on what works out best with you and her. You need to try to do a routine where it coincides with your work schedule, it'll help you and her be more happy :)|`|8e5bIYjJaa	My son (he's 6 months now) did exactly the same thing! He'd have a feed at 6.30pm, go down to sleep for an hour or so, and then wake up for another feed. He was usually out for the count around 9 - 9.30pm.    He stuck with this pattern until he was about 51/2 months. Now he goes down about 7.30 (yay!).     Sounds like she's happy, so stick with it :)|`|0VUZacRTaa	my daughter doesnt normally go to bed until around midnight. i like nights.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	when isabel was 2 months old, she didn't have a schedule quite yet. she ate on demand and slept when ever she wanted to. at about 3 months, she got into an awesome schedule. she lays down between 9pm and 11pm (tonight it was about 945pm) and she sleeps the whole night... its great. i love her.|`|dBdQB4KHaa	I vave taken care of so many diferent children and i see parents putting a new borne to bed as late as posebule so they can sleep the nite threw but when the shild is like 11/2 or 2 putting them to bed at like 8:30 but what ever gives you a littel time for your selfe|`|MgtfV1Aqaa	did/do    it looks like dildo...ok im done|`|zwctZ812aa	I put my 3 month old to bed at about 9:30 or 10:00, whenever I can get him to sleep.  At 8 weeks, I still wasn't able to get him on a schedule.  He went to bed whenever he felt tired...I usually got him down sometimes between 8:30 and 11:30.  It's not too late, don't worry. Babies that age get all the sleep that they need...they sleep when they're tired.  Sounds like you have a good routine going.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	When my son was a newborn I had him on a very flexible 4 hrs schedule and in in the day time I would wake him to feed and change at least once in every 4 hrs then when I was ready for him to sleep (for us it was around 10 or 11 at night)  I would feed him and change him and put him in his bassinet swaddled tightly and then I would let him sleep as long as he would and then when he woke up in the night I would change him and then feed him and wrap him up again and let him sleep as long as he would, mostly till morning when I was ready to get up and then start all over again.  Now he is 20 months old and we put him to bed sometime between 9:30 and 10... This works for us.  My husband works until 7 at night and he wants to spend time with his son and I'm not much of a morning person so it works great for me too!  He sleeps for at least 12 hrs at night so he is up around 10am.  Find the times that work for your family.  Don't feel like you have to have your baby in bed by 7 just because someone says that they put their kids down then.. If you don't like to get up that early then keep them up a little bit longer and they should sleep in later...  We do have some nice blackout curtains on his window because I find that most people wake up because of the light not because they are done sleeping so that way he sleeps till he is ready to wake up.
vfq04nc1aa	Hi  Thats so cute and beautiful! Im 14 weeks too and this week i can definetly tell im pregnant! I love having a little baby bump! I'm proud to show it off and my finace cant wait for me to get bigger!  Your's looks a lot like mine.  At the start mine was just bloat now but now mine is there all the time too.  Im quite skinny.

You must be due about a day after me.  Congrats on your pregnancy!!!  Take care!|`|Elxuvon8aa	at 14 weeks your flutters could be the baby|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Thanks for sharing your "mini baby bump" with us. If you're feeling fluttering sensations now, it's your baby. I first felt fluttering at 16 weeks. I too thought it was gas, but I began feeling it more & more each day. I knew then, it was my baby inside, saying, "Hi Mommy."|`|reO9Dgmsaa	How cute!!  :)  You may be feeling the baby.  At first it is so light and fluttery!  Before you know it baby will be kicking like a soccer player LOL!!|`|6L9jJnchaa	I was feeling flutters around that time. =)|`|1ezYfkX7aa	awww very cute!!! Its most likely gas sinse its your first baby...i would say you should start feeling the baby move at the earliest 16wks..but strong kicks wont start until about 23-26wks. Congrats and god bless =)|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Congrats to you! You look great! It could very well be the baby moving that you feel too. I hope you have a wonderful pregnancy!|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	Oh how cute!!! I cant wait!!!!|`|DNygQdmVaa	awh. congrats!  for your 1st baby you usually feel it move between 19-23 weeks.|`|5ETje6DTaa	congrats and cute pic.|`|y4E8EoZ2aa	You're bump is too adorable! :-D congrats!|`|IlSALGKMaa	It's a lot cuter then mine! Lol. (14 weeks, 3 days.) But you do look like you're sucking in to get it to poke out. You'll look so cute pregnant, I wish I was that thin to start with.|`|24P6A0oaaa	you so tiny and fit! very cute bump!  you will feel it soon, probably 2 weeks? for me was 17 weeks|`|y7vxGDyTaa	since your petite you may be feeling he or she move. normally first time pregnant ppl dont start feeling movement till the 4th or 5th month. but when your thin it usally means youll show sooner and feel the baby move sooner. and yes baby bumps are sooocute but just wait till your in your third trimester like i am and you back and hips hurt from all the baby your now carrying :] congrats
AA12328475	Unless AirTran Airways changed their policy (you know how all the airlines are charging for every little thing now), you don't have to pay extra for the stroller or carseat, whether you bought an extra seat for your toddler or not, and I see you did.  If you bought a seat for your toddler, they expect you to use a carseat, actually.  As for the stroller, you can roll it right up to the terminal, and use it up to the point that you board the plane; then, they'll have it ready for you when you deboard the plane at your next stop.  Neither should count as checked baggage or as one of your carry-ons.    That being said, it's probably best to call the airline's customer service number to be sure.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	always bring your own carseat -the child will be more comfortable.  contact your travel agent or the airlines website for more info.|`|xZo4wP6Faa	i agree with the first two people. and if you don't want to hold him, yes you will have to pay for an extra seat, if he will be strapped in, sitting in it, on one of the plane seats.  edit: i think i read your question wrong. if you paid for an extra seat, no they won't charge you to put him in the carseat, in the seat! that would be silly, but not surprising in this day and age.  good luck! my daughter loved the plane. she's 2|`|0qP8gLpyaa	If you take a car seat to use on a plane it must be FAA approved. Some models are not. If they are not they won't let you use it on some air lines and will hold it up front for you until you get off the plane at your destination.   They do the same with strollers since they can't be stowed in the over head compartment.    Depending on how old your child is if you plan to have them sit in their own seat you will be charged for the seat. I think once they are 2 they have to have their own seat. Infants and younger toddlers you can usually hold in your lap at no extra cost. Check with your airline about that.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You shouldn't have to pay extra. You might want to check with AirTran just to be sure. But I never did when I flew with my daughter to check her stroller. I've never brought a car seat for her, the last time I flew I actually used a CARES harness, which makes life SO much easier than lugging a car seat around the airports. I paid $75 for it, but I think it was worth it.     http://www.kidsflysafe.com/|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Check with the airline usually there isn't a charge.  The carseat can be checked and the stroller taken all the way to the plane.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	No, you do not get charged for it, nor do you bring it on the plane. They check it at the terminal as your board the plane, and then bring them back to you as you exit the plane at your destination. You hold the baby while you fly.
mgiJVjaKaa	Yes. I really don't care what kind of car somebody drives, and that you sold yours in order to help your mom is really awesome|`|5FRRD9qNaa	HELL NO, you don't have to be a girl to answer that one|`|nCrbKAuzaa	ow well honeslty i love riding in scooters and motorcycle..  it's fun and very enjoying.     for me it's ok to date a guy who rides scooter because that is fun ad very adventurous.|`|a83de5a604f0a0970fa4991239e4b698aa	Marriage-minded and family-oriented girls usually don't like 'speedy' guys.

afbdc9cdcab7afedc7d42b4654bf993aaa	I'd go to a clinic or any doctor .  You could be pregnant, in which case you would want to know right away.  And if not, you would want to be checked out to see why you've skipped two periods.  Don't be nervous and put it off...step up to the plate and find out right away...you'll feel so good afterward that you acted responsibly.  Best wishes.|`|6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Dear Ms,  Firstly pregnancy test kits are no final indicators and secondly missing your periods is also no confirmation that u are pregnant. Suggest visit a Gynaecologist at once to get professional help.|`|AA11978290	Go to a doctor. If you are not pregnant then there is something seriously wrong.|`|19419b33190eb94990a562b7e9b96989aa	It does sound odd, but there are other reasons for not having a period. Have you lost weight or had alot of stress? Has your diet changed dramatically? Have you had unprotected sex?  You don't mention how old you are. When my periods first started I had a couple and then they stopped for a while.  Best visit a doctor, they will do a test and be able to give you advice.|`|61fad25eed5772220978dad096851d5caa	Some people have to take blood test to find out if they are pregnant.I would go to the obgyn ASAP. Let them do a pap and blood test. It could be nothing then again it could be something very important. I used to skip periods all the time becouse of stress could just be something like that. Good luck to you and go to the doctor.|`|22a6d9ba70ebf6f828b1c3a86c5e551aaa	Most likely that you are not pregnant. However the fact that you have not got a period suggests that something has made it delay and I would recommend going to see a doctor who can give you a thorougher check up|`|d3ff4e9b017372a92d5b1dffa4e7b4f6aa	as stated before ditto-either is possible see the doctor-and im prayin for u -come to our 360 too and join it will give u something creative to do-and for your future husband-i pray for him too -thanks david|`|dab686736d10d68dbfe569f86aaafec9aa	I would go to the doctor. There is a chance you could be but if your not there is a problem so go in.

Home pregnancy tests can show a false negative|`|009760de7da7a32d98786d58ff2f8452aa	same thing happened to me a few months ago. you not having your period could be because of stress, miscalculation of when you last started my suggestion wait a week if still no period then go see doc.|`|6e12d1c02a7832e7e545211dccbac05aaa	Most likely no. Those tests are pretty accurate.|`|71c4b4dd27da37080fcac6c6f65a678daa	If you take two preg test it may indicate that you are not pregnant but there are cases that urine test is negative but when they had blood test it came out that they are pregnant.    I had an experience that I didnt got my period for almost 3 months and I made 2 preg test every month but it came negative.    I went to the ob-gyne and made the final test and it came negative. The reason was I had hormonal imbalance so I didnt have my period for almost 3 months. She gave me prescription and had taken that tablet for 1 week. (The tablet cannot be purchase over the counter, they need doctors prescription). After 2 weeks I got my period.    Consult an ob-gyne for this matter.|`|8d9a7b4daeb8835d8fb364ade42c6a07aa	i think that these test result is accurate|`|c118975feaebb09337e0f33819e5fd4daa	did u hv sex with guys and if so 4 sure ur preganant. if not go to hel for a dr. check for ur o&g
UUpsa35Daa	You deal with it by getting up and going and checking on them at least every half hour or hour...worries partially gone.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Tell them that they can't be alone together. If she wants him over they have to stay in the living room where they can have some privacy but not all. And if shedoesn't like it tell her that he won't be allowed over anymore.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Of course it's not okay.  You should be barging in there!|`|LTWlBSFNaa	my bro and his gf do that its fine give her condamns and leave her alone|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Oh wow, I was never left alone with my bf in my parent's home! Change the rules immediately unless you want to be called Grandma!|`|Lftu0e4Daa	Ok well im not saying that your daughter is doing this but when I was 15 and I started having my boyfriends in the basement, I was having both vaginal and oral sex in my basement, even if my parents and/or sisters were home. Sometimes my parents would be in the room right above the basement and we could hear them walking around so we could cover ourselves when they started getting close to the basement door. I would say try to get to know the guy first and if he seems nervous, it could be because he feels weird talking to you because he is having sex with your daughter or he is hiding something bigger. Just to be safe, you should buy your daughter birth control or advise her about condoms. Oh and a key tip: check out your daughters hair, check to see if its either messed up or looks likes it has just been combed through with her fingers alot and if she wears necklaces check to see if the charm is no longer in front or if the chain is right around her throat, those are key clues that something was going on down there.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Have the boyfriend over for dinner, ask them to have game night with you, invite them to the movies!    EDIT: They are going to do what they want when they want to anyway, but at least you could replace some of that with family time!|`|8CPH9l0vaa	Just explain that parental supervision when he is over is a must, and if she doens't like that, then he won't be able to come over period. There are far too many young girls getting pregnant these days to take a chance on it. Even if you trust her, it is just a good thing to do.|`|upK8oN2oaa	Do what my mum does. Just speak to your daughter very calmly and tell her that if he is a serious boyfriend that they need to spend at least some time with the family. Explain that it makes you uncomfortable and perhaps suggest some other room in the house where they can have some privacy but not the whole time.    If she kicks up a fuss then she isn't mature enough and that they now must be in sight of an adult the whole time (like it was back in the 50's)|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Uhm are you the parent here or not?  If you aren't comfortable with it tell her she can't go downstairs with him the entire time, that they have to be somewhere else, like her room with the door open, or in the living room for some of the time.|`|mcywqcHuaa	This is going to sting.    I myself am a sneaky 18 year old. me and my girlfriend have had sex with her mom sleeping in the next room. we also rarely use condoms.  if you think they're just sitting down there enjoying each others company, you must be in serious denial. and, it won't matter if you tell them you don't want them doing it. we're very resourcefull. we have cars, and friends houses, and parents who don't care what we do, so long as its in our own rooms. my dad left me and her alone for an hour and a half in my room. he knows what we were doing.    sit them both down and tell them what you want. you're the parent; buck up and lay down the law.     but be careful. don't be accusitive or mean.|`|xZvzLztZaa	As a 17 year old guy, I can say that teens like their privacy.    As long as you're comfortable that your daughter will make good decisions, don't worry about it, and let her have her privacy.    Good luck,  Micah|`|AA10953999	Hell no its not ok. If they want to be out having sex they should be finding someplace else to do it in. It's called respecting your parents home and rules. You've left them alone for so long I'm sure they have already done everything under the sun.    Maybe now is the time to talk to your daughter about birth control. Teens are going to find ways to have sex, especially since you've made it so easy for them. Now you have to make sure no unwanted pregnancies come from their basement time together.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Your house, your rules -- if you don't want them by themselves downstairs, DON'T LET THEM GO DOWN THERE!  Talk to your daughter before he comes and explain that, whether or not it's reasonable, you are uncomfortable with them being downstairs by themselves. They are welcome to the semi-privacy of the den or living room, but not the basement.|`|KBL79wPqaa	if you trust your daughter not to make poor choices, you let them be.  Otherwise, tell them to keep the door to the basement open and go down and check on them every now and then.  Excuses like "thought you'd like some snacks" "have to check on the laundry" and "your father is going to be home soon" are always good ones.  I had a lot of friends whose parents didn't let them be alone with boys.  My mother left me alone with boys all the time and I wasn't a **** nor did I sleep with anyone until I was much older.  I doubt they will have sex while you're home anyways.|`|AA12115728	Not if it makes you uncomfortable.  Why? Because it's YOUR house.  Make them stay in the areas where the rest of the family is, or make fairly frequent random passes through the basement area of YOUR house.  Here are two expressions my mother used when I questioned her rules: "Because I'm the mother," and "I pay the cost to be the boss."|`|hXKooWj5aa	being open with your kids im a fun way is always the best way. especially if it happens to deal with an uncomfortable topic like sex so just open up in a fun way and she will get to listen and opening up little by little|`|p9SfW62kaa	you can ask them what they do and every so often go down there
cWP73qEsaa	I don't know but you should really get checked out by a gynecologist because if it was a miscarriage they need to clean you and do a scrape or something like that because you can get a very bad infection and i mean serious. take care!|`|DNygQdmVaa	just an iregular period.|`|wTiYbK4haa	I think it was just a normal period. If you have been stressed or anything recently it could have sent them all over the place. I dont think you had a misscarriage as you would have had a lot more bleeding than that.    Take care
Lnpqs5lHaa	I registered at target a month ago. They gave me a cute white cloth bag with booklets & pamplets inside with coupons. 2 samples of diapers from pampers & huggies. & a $20 gift card for shutterfly.com i think?? Shutterfly is an online photo site where u upload & print ur pictures. You can even put ur baby's photos on books, calendars, mugs & etc. So i thought that was nice.|`|3hkCIu78aa	Hey me 2. so when you find out let us all know. lol Thanks in advance|`|3hIr3Dllaa	I didn't find any when registering|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	babies r us is the only place that comes to mind|`|oJzMFaxuaa	When registering at babies r us (in store only) they give you a box full of coupons and samples and stuff.  Also after your due date they'll send you a coupon to help you buy what you didn't recieve.      Target also offers a coupon toward the end of your pregnancy but they have a really bad return policy so I usually don't buy things there.
AeARjAD5aa	I really like it, and love the name Rae for girls! Good Luck with the baby! If I have a girl I'm naming her Liliana a version of my gram's name (Lillian which will be her great grams), since I was named Katelynn, a version of my great grandmother's name Katherine...   I think it's nice to give your baby a name of such a great woman, as well as her own identity since it's not exactly the same name.|`|TX9igTWraa	i like it a lot!|`|fU4pOpeHaa	i like it but not the haliegh spelling|`|wziUVyVoaa	That's a beautiful name. I love the spelling and the meaning gives it even more character. Your daughter will be proud to grow up with a beautiful, unique name...especially if she's named after an amazing woman =). Rae is always a pretty name, no matter what anyone says. And it rolls off the tongue nicely with the last name. I say good job, and I hope you have a healthy baby girl!|`|KkFKdRG8aa	I thinks thats awonderful name;and i like how you put yerr hubby's gma's name it it at the same time!!

AeARjAD5aa	It's the whole name - first and middle (obviously last) to be a Jr. My uncle and my cousin are named after my Pop Pop, but they have different middle names, so they aren't Jr's.  Actually, my Pop's side of the family did that with most of the men, kept the same first names, but different middles to avoid having a Robert Henry the 17th. It still helps keep a family name alive without there being a whole long line of them.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Jr's. are exactly the same name as the father|`|TX9igTWraa	i'm pretty sure he has to have the same middle name.|`|wziUVyVoaa	As far as I know, the child has to have the same middle name too, or else the Jr. is void.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	i wondered that too  no jr.  and i liked it better that way anyway|`|ydPrJeBEaa	My boyfriend is named after his dad except for his middle name and he doesn't have a Jr.
u2EUom6daa	i think it is in between 1-2 months my best friend got morning sickness quite early on in here pregnancy and i never got it at all, everyone is different but i would say in the first couple of months would be the earliest it started.|`|AA11762804	mine started at 5 weeks, it was horrible but i went to my doctor and got some anti-nausa medication|`|HrpeBCRLaa	It really depends on the person. I know my mom started feeling sick enough at two weeks that she had to go in to get checked.  It all depends on your body's chemistry.|`|AEa7HHfmaa	My morning sickness is horrible. It started before I knew I was even pregnant. Right now I am 8 weeks and it started around 5 weeks. I started off just feeling not right at night, like I was going to be sick, but it never happened-went on for probably a week. After that I started to actually get sick. Its been almost 4 weeks and its not getting better! I hope things are better for you! Most things that I have read or look at say 6-8 weeks is when morning sickness happens, but obviously it varies from person to person. Good luck to you :)|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I first got sick one week after conception. I thought it was the flu at first, but it didn't go away. After I missed my first period, I knew I must be pregnant, & by the time I saw the doctor, to confirm it,  I was so sick 24/7. I ate lots of Saltine's for the first three months. The baking soda in the crackers helped calm my tummy.|`|vWnVopWyaa	2 month|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Every one get their different time.|`|KGT1B0Elaa	Nice ques! Im trying to get pregnant.. at this juncture.. any feelings of nausea is welcome.|`|R65Owmebaa	for some its in a few weeks some don't get it at all.
Vf0bmaVGaa	Things like yogurt, all natural. Cheerios are good finger foods because they dissolve easily. Chopped up bananas. We have actually fed ours chicken and turkey that were blended in a blender. What you have to watch out for is things like banana that might constipate and apple that might cause diarrhea. Cooked sweet potatoes are really soft and easy to digest. Most fruits can be blended or chopped up like pears, peaches etc... to accommodate your child's ability to eat and digest.     Ours started eating at 7 weeks. I would have never started him but we couldn't keep up with feeding him. He was growing so fast. He is one year and one month and wears 2T clothes. He is not fat. He started walking at 9 months. He is just maturing and growing really fast.     Our first boy didn't grow near as quickly. He was totally satisfied with breast milk and we added different foods in time. I guess what I am saying is take it slow if they aren't ready for something right now you can try it again in a week or two. They change so quickly. Good luck!|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My son is 6 months and just started a solid foods schedule.  It's planned out up to 8 months.  He only gets lunch (1 tbspn.) now and at 7 months will start breakfast (1 tbspn.).  We'll see if he needs more at 8 months.  I have a list of every food and what age he can ahve them at and then plan 4 days to "introduce" that food.  Once it's introduced it can be mixed with his other foods, so the combos are further down on teh schedule.  At 6-7 even 8 or 9 months food is more for practice then anything else and is not a necessary part of their diet although developmentally they should start by 8 months, so you don't need to be cramming 2-3 jars in their mouth every day.  I make my own mostly (except peas and carrots) adn everything is organic with nothign added.  Unfortunately my son will not eat most veggies without rice cereal mixed in.  If you haeva  problem feeding your baby something, try mixin git with cereal.  My doctor said that it's usually not a taste issue as the ahve nothign to compare it to, it's generally a textural problem.  Adding cereal gives it more texture.  Right now we're still on only veggies, but breakfasts will be fruits.  Here's the next several foods we are trying/have tried:    butternut squash  peas  carrots  oatmeal cereal  banana  pear  green beans   sweet potato  peaches    By the time he's gotten through these foods he'll be 7 months and up to 2 "meals" a day and will be able to have more combinations of foods.    Do you buy your food or make it?|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	My baby will 7 months on Feb. 8th so I want I have been giving her is sweet potato, applesauce, blueberries and apple, organic oatmeal, just tried some bread the other day.  My daughter also loves to takes sips from my vitamin bottle.

We are just starting out.|`|8e5bIYjJaa	My 6 month old son is having a mix of breast milk and pureed foods at the moment. (He started trying foods at 41/2 months).     So far he eats -     Avocado  Apple and oatmeal  Sweet potato  Pumpkin  Banana  Farex (baby cereal)  Figs  Pear  Apricot rice pudding  Brocolli  Peas  Corn  Chicken    I'm trying to introduce new tastes all the time - tonight it's pureed parsnip, steak and potato for dinner with a baby custard for dessert....we shall see how well it goes down!|`|PymLdXM8aa	Well my daughter loves green beans, squash,and sweet potatoes for veggies and pears and peaches for fruits. Oh and we just tried prunes tonight because she was a little constipated  and she liked those!    You can also try bananas, applesauce, carrots, peas, cereal and a few others. You can look up o the internet what else but i just stick to whatever Gerber 1st foods makes which is pretty much all that stuff!
PJYrLxZHaa	I would definitely recommend allowing your parents to talk first. That way they can build trust between the two of them, and it will help them feel more at ease with the situation. I'd also recommend maybe having your parents there when you guys meet (for example- you guys can do dinner with your parents or something, then go to a movie alone or something like that) so your parents can meet him as well. Good luck!!|`|MigBOiUPaa	sure i guess. i bet ur parents will be pissed when they find out tht ur talkin to strangers over the internet and will probably make u get rid of ur myspace...but hey its worth a shot!|`|AA11126544	I would advise against it; but if  you do meet him, make sure it's in a public place, take a friend/adult along, and make sure someone knows where you're going in case something was to happen.|`|DNygQdmVaa	if you wanna meet him youre gonna have to go through your parents.  my cousin met a boy on the internet, shes 17 and so is he..and they live in diff states.  and theyre parents let them meet eachother.    so you never know|`|mcywqcHuaa	I'm not trying to make you feel sad by saying this. and i'm not trying to discourage you, either.     my friend does this all the time. maybe it's just her, but the guys she meets aren't nice to her. she does the same thing you do, calling them and the whole stickam thing.     however, that could just be her. there's nothing wrong with meeting people online. before the internet, people met each other through even more dangerous mediums. we seem to forget that as a society from time to time.     be careful. give it at least another month before you make any plans at all.
TprIqGhCaa	Hm, you should keep an eye on that, and if there's any bleeding then you should go to your doctor.|`|NDnAN4VPaa	i looked on a "pregnancy symptom" site and   it said that having your lower back ache, is a   sign of pregnancy.    so, you're normal.|`|OcoXinSHaa	Is this your first?
BUI9HnH1aa	forgiven ..  u can tell by the tone of the woman's voice that the 12 yr old wasn't " stabbing a toddler" .   The woman should have called her local police department , not 911 .   911 is for life and death situations , not help me control my preteen child|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Honestly, I think fired.  It's something called professionalism.  In your job, you are not there to make jokes.  There is personal time for that.  In this day and age, you have to be careful what you say.  Look at what kids are doing these days...bringing guns to school, shooting classmates, it's sad.  The world is different now and a comment like that should be taken seriously.  Especially coming from a 911 operator who is supposed to be there to help in an emergency situation.  Now if the woman had called a friend or a relative and said something like that it's fine, no big deal you know the person, but coming from a total stranger that is supposed to be there to help you, yes I think he should be fired.|`|DNygQdmVaa	That was uncalled for.  its a 911 call not time to joke around.|`|cg3IaThxaa	AHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!   damn that women sounded like such an incompetent bithc.   i hope he doesn't get fired.  she should get in trouble instead.  9/11 is for EMERGENCYS, not saying you are too poor of a mother to contorl your daughter.  if the girl was stabbing a toddler or something,  mike would have known from the beginning that it was serious by the sound of her voice.|`|L5xLdtVcaa	personally i think that is funny as hell, and if i worked as a dispatcher and i didn't care about my job i would do that too! iv talked to cops and i could see why he would say that, they get the dumbest phone calls about things like that!|`|TSyESseaaa	haha  that was pretty funny  forgiven =]|`|KK3RkRjxaa	Fired! 911 is not a place for jokes unless the caller says something first!|`|LwoOdSycaa	first thing that made me smile tonight. forgiven. it was a joke. seems as if he was sorry.|`|3rda58OCaa	I am not sure he should be fired but reprimanded for sure!  You CANNOT joke about killing someones kid!!  You just can't do it.  Her child may need to be "scared straight" or something, and this woman thought the only way was to call 911-obviously this wasn't an emergency, so she should've just called the sheriffs dept.  They are both morons!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Fired in my opinion.  Her daughter could have been one of those 'teen rebels' like you see on the maury show.    She could have been physically hurting somebody in the house e.g other child/infant, animal or even her mother.      They expect their call centre to be taken seriously like no prank calls etc...They should also take their calls seriously.  Although it did make ma laugh!
	Hey    It depends on how long the person has been taking birth control for.  Some woman's bodies take up to a year to get back to normal and ovulate again.  It maybe possible, depending if the person does start ovulating straight away and the sperm fertilize the egg.    It varies in different woman. Hope this answers your question ok lol.  xx|`|	ugh you ppl need to stop spamming
AA10413046	I do think you should tell your mom most things about yourself and your life.  Here's why, your mother is the one person in your life who would willingly die for you.  She loves you more than anyone else on this earth.  Your mom only wants the best for you.  If she knows what is going on with you for one, she will know better how to help you, and two, knowing what is going on with you will put her mind at ease.  Mothers tend to get paranoid about their kids and what they are doing if they  pull back from us.  Mothers will ALWAYS worry about their children but as a mother myself, I would appreciate worrying about the correct things not the things I have made up in mind because my child wouldn't talk to me.  Yes, your mother has been through some of the same things as you when she was younger.  Trust her.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I am going through the same thing. And all mothers say 'you can tell me anything' but in reality you can't. We need our own space and our own secrets. Tell her the things that won't upset her and go to her for advice, but sometimes friends are just better with somethings then mothers. And yes she was a child at one point but when she was a kid the chance of America having a black president wasn't even imaginable!! Things have changed and she doesn't realize just how much they have. Tell her that you need your own space at times.|`|AA12115728	It is natural for you to gradually grow away from your mother, and no, I don't think she has to know every thing that goes on in your head.  All humans need privacy.  I can assure you that she doesn't "know what's going on in your mind," because if she did, she wouldn't be asking or nagging.      It's too bad that she doesn't know that the one way to create a wedge between yourself and another person is to smother them.  Is there a way you can respectfully explain to your mom that you need space, and that maybe you'd like to talk to her about some things, but not everything, and not on demand?    Good luck.|`|67d2a15ae64481f999d40bb559aeea69aa	its up to you actually.  with me and my mom ((im 14, and a freshman)) i dont tell my mom everything about me. i tell her most stuff, but not things that i dont think she would approve of, people doing things she wouldn't approve of, or anything of that nature.  everyone has secrets...  i figure that its okay, as long as you tell her enough to keep her out of your hair and dont get into drugs or lots of sex or something of that nature!

HOdblqIkaa	high school sucks for most people at first. you have to start over, many times youll lose the people you were close to in middle school, making you feel very alone. but it gets better, much much much better. go out to football games and other sporting events. talk to some kids in your classes you have things in common with. 2 of my best friends i met in american history because we didnt know anyone else in the class and had to work in groups alot. if you like to cook sign up for those classes. alot of guys will take the class because they think its easy, some actually enjoy it, and plenty of girls love it. if you think a girl is cute try to get to know her. if you teachers say you have to work with someone you havent worked with before ask her to be your partner or during a project sit near her and ask what shes planning on doing. it sounds corny i know but it does work. even if nothing exciting comes out of it, youll at least have talked to her and thats better than admiring her from across the room. since she is in 2 of your classes then you can just bump into her and ask if she got the homework from the day before or notes or something. try joining a club in an activity you enjoy. there are lots of things you can do to gain more friends in high school but sitting at home watching re runs wont help you any. high school is a really good time in your life, if i could go back i would in a heartbeat. if people think your immature maybe you need to evaluate your actions and see if your doing something(s) that you think are amusing but others dont.|`|xZvzLztZaa	Don't try to be someone you're not.

UUpsa35Daa	If she's doing inappropriate things, she shouldn't have as much privacy a you used to give her. Start supervising her computer usage and have her earn back her privacy. She's a minor and lives under your roof...she should be following your rules.    Other than that, have a sit down with her and let her know what you found out. She'll complain about the "invasion" of privacy but that's beyond the point. She needs to clean up her act and attitude and that's what the talk should be about along with the actions you decide to take.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Tell her that you don't care how she dresses but you will not be having her swear. Delete her myspace and her e-mail. And not let her on the comp. I personally think the 'scene' style is hideous!|`|fjkRIUSnaa	you need to shut her myspace acct DOWN. take her phone take her computer . put parental controls on the computer where she cant access it from home. i would definetly have her myspace closed down if yo need help doing this let me know . i can be contacted at vanillafudg02@yahoo.com|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Sounds like a normal teenager to me! being 'scene' is currently very fashionable and trying to change it will just make it worse. Can she stop the language when the situation calls for it? if she can then its just a matter of following fashion and all you really can do is sit back, shake your head and take solace in the fact that in twenty years time she'll look back on her photos and think "oh my god, what was I thinking". Actually, thinking about it get the camera out, start playing the proud mama and strt taking photos! You'll have heaps of stuff to embarrass her in front of the grandkids and thats the best revenge a mother can take!|`|upK8oN2oaa	Put parental control on the internet and have a serious talk about self-respect and bullying. All those people who say you shouldn't 'invade her privacy' are being immature. How is it 'private' if it is on the internet? If she is bullying people this needs to be stopped immediately. However, I will say that there is probably little you can do about the slutty pictures etc on myspace and it probably isn't a great way to build trust between you. I would assume she has done or said something that made you look.     The world would be a better place if everyone acted like their mother was looking over their shoulder.|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	Parental controls on internet - make her change her MySpace to be appropriate. .  Ttake away her phone  Have a serious talk with her personal presentation and attitude - sounds like she needs your guidance. Come up with some expectations - and priveledges for desired behavior.

Confront her now. She can easily offend someone with her swearing, her sluttiness could lead to her being promiscuous, even pregnant, or have and STD.    And with her cyber bullying, she could end up driving someone to suicide. Cyber bullying is illegal and she can get in major trouble for that.    You need to make her delete her myspace, and talk to her about what she's doing and where it could lead her.|`|rWeLFd2daa	Let me say one thing you dont want her to catch  you snooping she will be really really upsset just let her do her own thing she has to make mistakes and learn on her own.

VClxXNs3aa	well at least you'll be able to pay for the doctor's office visits.....     now start working on the hospital bill, diapers, clothes, crib......      oh, uplifting words, um... well... good luck.|`|HOdblqIkaa	well first your going to have to tell your parents. thats the best place to begin because of your age. just sit them down and tell them your expecting. they will be mad, i mean your 14, but it really wouldnt be much better if you were 15 or 16. that much money is a pretty substantial amount but its going to go fast. if your parents insurance will continue to carry you while your pregnant thats really good. if not then apply for medicaid which requires you to be on welfare but because of your age, your still living with your parents, and your savings you might not get on but it cant hurt to try. once you tell them you need to set up an app for an ultrasound to determine how far along you are and to get an estimated due date. your boyfriend should be involved in as much as he can if hes going to take responsibility. that means someones gotta tell his parents. its good that you want to finish high school but with a newborn and all the drs visits youll have, i suggest you either tansfer to a school that helps with pregnant teens or take time off. if your against abortion thats your choice remember no one can force you into it no matter your age. you should keep adoption in mind though. there are plenty of people willing to adopt a newborn who will be able to care and support it better than you(no offense meant by that but with school and work for you itll be difficult) the best thing to do is make the decision with your parents, theyve had children they know what to do. maybe theyll agree to take care of it while your at work and school, but if they dont and you do keep it childcare costs alot. many day cares will provide free care if you are an employee so maybe you should look into that. a baby costs about $9000-$12,000 before birth and an average of $10,000 each year.   im not trying to be rude so dont take anything the wrong way, im just being realistic. having a baby is hard work and you may think your prepared but chances are you have no idea what your getting yourself into. best of luck to you no matter what happens.|`|Rngq461zaa	it depends on your parents  if your parents understand you, you are not screwed  but if they are strict about teen pregnancy, what can i say?...|`|AA11126544	I'm praying for you, and glad you decided to keep the baby, instead of abortion. :)|`|DS4HDNiHaa	Tell your parents.  They will be upset and really mad at you, but at the end of the day, they will accept you despite your mistake.  If they love you (which I think they do) they will support you through the pregnancy.  And they will help you raising the child.  Be ready for a very long sermon though.    You should also tell your boyfriend. His parents should also know.  I think your parents will talk to them.      I admire you for deciding against abortion.  Having sex at your age was a mistake but the baby is a gift from God so it is only right to accept it.|`|x9REbxP1aa	S l u t.       You're dumb|`|AA11635397	u trying to be grown so face whats coming to u|`|2AZim0rUaa	can you talk to another adult that you trust? get them to go with you and tell your parents. Things are scary right now, but you are going to need the support of your family to be able to handle this and finish school.  You also need to get to the dr and  get checked over and get some vitamins. Your age makes it important to not wait to see a doctor. Remember that your doctor cannot tell your parents, if you do not want to go to your family doctor check out the local health department, they can give you advise and options. I think you are saying you want to keep the baby but adoption is an option even if it is within your family.|`|LgvkgsOtaa	Obviously, your parents should see how responsible you are being in regards to funding the baby.    Just sit them down and say,   "Mom/ Dad, I did something very selfish and stupid. I'm young and I make mistakes, but I promise to take full responsibility, but for being my parents, I need you are your support. I am pregnant, but I will do everything I can to raise my baby, and I am truely and deeply sorry, and I hope that you can forgive me and focus on helping me get through this rough time."    I'm am very happy you chose to keep this baby alive, and that you are trying to give it a good life.  Be prepared on living an adult life. You have made an adult choice.   This means less time with friends, less of going out, but eventually you'll find that motherhood can be rewarding, and you learn from your mistakes.    Also, please please please stay in school! I know the idea of college seems impossible, but try to graduate in high school. This will be better for you and the baby.    You made a mistake you can't fix, but you are doing a great job of making it work. Congratulations on this, and I wish you the best of luck.|`|mcywqcHuaa	well, you can't hide it forever. you've got about 3 months from when you first found out before it becomes plainly obvious.    i know this sounds heartless, but it might be best to give it up for adoption. a 14 year old is never equipped to deal with a baby. give it to someone who can and will care for it.|`|xZvzLztZaa	Talk to your parents calmly.    You were responsible and used protection, unfortunately things don't always work.    With your resources, and your parents support and help, you can take care of the baby.    Think long and hard about every decision you make and you'll be fine.    I wish you the very best of luck,  Micah|`|hXKooWj5aa	no matter what she has to tell her parents its not like you going to hide her belly foreverjust sit them down gently and open the discussion  never rush it out and say "heY! im pregnant"|`|AA10953999	I know of a few people in their 30's that were born when their moms were 13 & 14 so I know a woman that young can carry a baby to term. However, they are not the perfect examples of a good parents.     You should probably talk to your parents about it, I know its going to be hard but in the long run you are going to need them more than ever. It takes a lot more than money to raise a baby. Who is going to take care of it while you are at school?    What about the father, is he going to put 100% effort into this pregnancy? That baby needs love and support from both your families. You cannot undue what is done but you can make sure that baby grows up to be a happy, healthy adult.|`|Xce2KvGnaa	Consider Abortion:    When you're an adult, delivering a baby hurts like hell!  Your not even an adult yet. Imagine how painful it will be for you.    Your body is still developing which means there's a chance that your baby will not come out the normal way (you may have to go through surgery)    Also, having a baby adds a lot of stress to your life. do you think that's fun??  once you have that baby, your childhood ends which means your fun in life ends. and you'll have to deal things the adult way.    If you're less than 2 months, then abortion isn't that bad. You're not really killing a baby because the baby hasn't formed yet.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Its gd that you take complete responsibility for this issue. Personally, i think you should tell your parents. Your scared, yes, i would b too but its the best thing. No matter how much yur parents may disagree and not want to except it they have to because they are your parents. Parents & friends are the best support you have in times of trouble and no matter how scared you are do what is right for you.     Good Luck. xx|`|TKl5hnv3aa	You know, I'm sorry.

If your parents are anti-teen pregnancy then talk to another adult you trust.  This isn't something you can do on your own but it isn't impossible if you have the help and support of friends and family.  Take it one day at a time and try not to get too worked up, things will turn out alright.  Also, if it's been less than 72 hours (which I doubt if you have a positive pregnancy test) you can go to the pharmacy and get Plan B which will prevent the pregnancy.  Future reference I guess.|`|5ETje6DTaa	ur being a very grown up girl. congrats on keeping the baby and not getting an abortion.kudos for owning up to ur mistake and taking responsilbilit.im glad uve thought ahead financially.     talk to them with another person u trust.it seems scary now but u'll do great!|`|02p9wINEaa	You OBVIOUSLY thought you were old enough for Sex for some unknown reason,  so that means that you are obviously ready to face the world and life in general.|`|QqRARcOeaa	You could always consider abortion. I mean at 14 it is a hard age to bring up a child successfully and it might make it very difficult for you to finish school and difficult for you and your boy friend's relationship. In the long run you could have a child with your boyfriend when you are both older and have finished school, have your own place etc. I think it is a very very hard thing to raise a child and it might be best if you just wait til a little later in life. And you and your boyfriend have been together for like 5 years so you can have time to love eachother with children in the picture making everything so stressful for the things you want to do with your life atm. and also you can always go to local youth centres or medical centre to discuss options. And i have had a friend how has had an abortion and she said it didnt hurt that much and you don't have to stay in hospital ( so then i guess you don't have to tell your parents) because it's a day procedure and your free to leave after 1 hour or so or the procedure. Up to you but sometime you need to look at the biger picture for your future etc when you making such an important dission as this one. Good luck

xklPs0Ldaa	I dont see why your doctor wouldnt be discrete about it. If you are not underage whatever you go for to his office should be confidential. If he is not an OB/Gyn doc. then he will refer you to one. Go to which ever one you would feel most confortable with.

She is 6 months and still likes to use it.    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...  Can be found at Target or Walmart    It is the Rainforest Bouncer.      Product Description  The Rainforest Bouncer features a new rainforest themed fashion and toy bar with a see-thru 'waterfall' as the centerpiece created by lights and clear spinning helixes that create the effect of a waterfall. 2 colorful character friends up top, a monkey and a toucan, keep baby visually stimulated while 2 hanging toys provide lots of activity with spinners and flutters that have lots of bright colors and textures. The toy bar easily removes for getting baby in & out. Two great modes of play include: 1. mom activated - with 6 longer, continous playing songs and 2. baby activated - with 6 shorter songs plus 3 SFX that reward baby for active play with the toys. Also includes mom activated calming vibrations and volume control. 3 point restraint keeps baby safely seated and the pad is sacked out to fully support baby's head, neck and shoulders.    This was a life saver for us when she was a newborn. It soothed her right to sleep. I will admit I even used it in her crib sometimes.|`|qyObFvz6aa	If you have the space for an infant seat, i would recommend getting the one from Bright Starts instead of the bouncer. It has everything you are looking for: control music and reclines. It only has one setting for vibration. My baby absolutely loved it--when we brought her home it was the only thing she would sleep in for the first two weeks.     http://www.brightstarts.com/BSSub14x53x1...    But they do have bouncers too. I'm sure they are just as good.    http://www.brightstarts.com/BSSub14x0x1x...|`|0VUZacRTaa	target has a bouncy seat made by boppy with all that. my daughter, husband and I love it!|`|52U22fiAaa	I have the rainforest bouncer... loved it.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	i like rainforest bouncy seat|`|Lnpqs5lHaa	http://www.target.com/Fisher-Price-Beaut...      http://www.target.com/Bright-Starts-Crad...
