20090309131730AASl89J	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girls, do you know it too?	I'm not like any kind of kung fu master or nothing like that, but i always thought that if a girl would ever go and try to slap my face that i would just reach out and block away their hand. Not hitting them back, but just blocking it so when they try to slap it won't work. Well, this girl did try to slap me, and what i thought doesn't work. But that's because she used some tricky move on me that totally confused me so i couldn't move at all. She stood right in front of me and was standing with a hip out and a hand on it. I only had a second, but i was paying attention to her left hand cuz that was the one she had placed on her hip. But she put her right hand out and slapped me, and there's like, no way to block that move. If there is, i don't have a clue how. It works. Will you tell me if there is, just in case a girl ever tries something like that again? And, have you ever used that on a guy before?

Right i took alot of advice from this site regarding my story involving a girl at work in a very senior position. The response i got was that she was playing games with me,enjoying it and flirting.The advice i got was to avoid her at all cost which i did today but just keep it work related. Firstly i did not sit next to her which i used to but on another table. She came to me and said hello which i did as well and that's it. She then came straight back and said whats up with you which i said just want to chill out . She said fine and left in a strop.I then heard her talking on her mobile quite loud that her belly hurting thinking she was trying to tell me.I ignored her.Later on i was working elsewhere in the building when i looked up and seen her walking pass me smiling at me.I smiled back but put my head down.I even did not offer to buy any tea or chocolates today which i do usually. What do you think she his up to know that i have ignored her all day.Also should i continue avoiding her.

20090309132131AAN4hQr	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think about this?	My coworker has recently split up with the gf with whom he has a son. For this Saturday he asked if I wanted to go to a show w him and his son. I felt it was a bit odd as we don′t see each other out of work. But I figured maybe he felt lonely and asked if he wanted to come out w me and a friend. Ha called me instantly and said yes. Later on that night he calls again and says he can′t make it because of the son. He then texts me and says he will call me the day after and we can meet up. Today I had a missed call from him, so I texted and said what I was doing. He then calls less than a minute later saying that he will be downtown in a couple of hours and we can meet up. A few hours later he texts again saying he can′t make it because his son has fallen asleep. What is this all about? I can′t figure out if he really wants to meet up or if he′s making up excuses not to meet up. What do you think?

20090309132844AAEjYZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if your boyfriend is using you?	Just some background information: My boyfriend is 17 and I am 16. I've been getting some...bad vibes...from him for about two weeks, and I've noticed these things before. Well, anyways...In the beginning, when I first started dating him (about 6 months ago), we broke up after 1 month because he told me he was using me... Then about three weeks later, we got back together because he apologized and told me he didn't mean it. Now it's been 5 months since then, and I'm starting to realize signs and feel really wrong around him...as if he's embarrassed to be dating me. He only calls if I show up at his work, or calls if I ask him...Or only when I am in a bad mood. He ignores me often when I send him messages or if I just want to talk to him...I only see him about once every other week, and when we're hanging out, he's either asking about "rusty nails", our little inside joke that has to do a little bit about sex (but we haven't had it), and it's becoming more apparent that when I'm around him, he brightens up when we talk about it. It has also become apparent to both my best friend and her boyfriend who is best friends with him, that something just isn't quite right... I've been feeling really pushed away lately. And now I'm starting to feel used by him... I don't know for sure, and he wont tell me anything. And I'm afraid to express what I think and what I'm feeling because I really love him and I don't want him to break up with me... But if he's using me, I'm going to anyways (sorry if that's confusing). I just need some advice on what i should do. Please help me.

20090309133241AAsIDaL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I leave him now or wait for him to grow up?	I know I already posted a question like this but I just wanted some more opinions...My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half and I'm almost finished with my first year of college. I have always been a high achiever and am progressing in my schooling and life pretty quickly. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is a high school drop out (he has, however, had a really tough life so far and is dyslexic so school was really hard for him.) He has gotten a lot of his life together and is much better off than he was but he always seems like he's procrastinating everything. He's been "studying" for his GED since last year but it's now a month away and he still barely does anything. He also lives with his mom and I wouldn't care but he doesn't have a job, isn't going to school and barely studying for his GED. We talked about moving in together in the summer but I'm now realizing he probably won't even have his GED. I think I love him, but it's like he's not very serious about the really important things. Should I keep waiting for him to mature and get his act together or leave him and stop worrying constantly about if he's ever going to get his GED. go to college, or even have a stable job?      Another thing...every time I talk to him about not getting his act together with school he gives me a huge guilt trip and makes me feel mean for saying anything because he's dyslexic. I know things are hard for him...but I also know dyslexic people who worked very hard to achieve things like a college degree. I just feel like if he really cared about his future he would really buckle down and study.
20090309132633AAaEwcK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel crazy and need some help?	Before my recent relationship,  I was happy on my own and enjoying life for me.  Since we hooked up I can't stop thinking about him, I dream I can't get it out of my head I fight with myself constantly to stop thinking about him we use to be just friends and it was great,  he gave me kindness, attention, and good vibes and feelings.  Since we got more intimate I just feel more alone and we work together so its hard to control how I feel.  I just never wanted to ruin our friendship but it seems to have went down hill.  I just can't get him off my mind,  and the more I think about him its like the less I think he thinks about me,  I just need to get him off my mind.

When he broke up with me he did it through a text message so im mad about that. so i told him that we needed to talk about it. he said he'd come over and talk. he's cancelled coming over twice now. and it's soooo annoying i feel like he doesnt care about me.

20090309134018AAkkRep	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help on coping with my husband, please?	Sorry all, but I am just having a very hard time today.  This past weekend was absolutely horrible.  My huband started bickering with my 15 yr old over something very irrelevant (like whos darts were whos).  My hubby works with a 24 yr old that has an ego the size of earth and is constantly doging everyone saying he is the best at everything.  I think this gets to my hubby and he brings it home with him.  Anyway, that was Friday night.  Saturday we were supposed to go the a hockey game (which were tickets from last years fathers day present) and instead he had an attitude all freakin day.  My 4pm he was drunk.  He gets so hateful. Says such horrible hurtful things.  Needless to say, we didnt go to the game.  He decided that he just wanted everyone to leave so he could be alone.  I took my son and his friend to his friends house with the tickets so they could still go and then took my daughter in law and granddaughter (who were staying the weekend with us) out to eat.  The whole time we were gone, I got texts and phone calls galore from him continuing to be hateful and controlling. I dont even want to get into what he was saying here.  He finally calmed down for a short while and asked if I would come home, because he was lonely without me.  I did.  He started throwing crap around the house (in front of daughter in law ans grandbaby), yelling  at me and still sending me texts telling me how I treat him so terribly.  I couldnt take it anymore, so I took daughter in law and grandbaby home (a 2 1/2 hr drive) and returned to him still being an a*** once again after he had done the yo yo crap and said he was sorry.  How does one deal with this?  My hubby never remembers all the hateful, hurtful crap he spews out of his mouth.  I do.  Coping with this is getting harder and harder everytime it happens.
20090309134208AAuM2iQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did you discuss how many children you may want to have before getting married?	I have seen questions on here and I know people in real life who don't then get surprised once in a marriage.  One wants a big family one wants only one or none.   Marriages have actually broken up over these things.  It baffles me that one would not discuss such an important issue before hand.  That goes with part of your ability to stay together. You don't bring it up on a first date but somewhere between then and the alter that conversation should come up.    I will give an example my cousin only wants one child has always said so.  If he had not had a conversation with a previous girl friend he may of married someone who wanted 4 kids. She would of either not been happy with the one he wanted or she would of left him or he would not be happy with more kids that he did not want to have.  It was very sad but they broke up and he is married to a wonderful girl who also only wants one child.

I am in a long distance relationship with a great guy and we've been talking on the phone and dating for a few months. He is everything I could want. He's so nice, shows me affection, and isn't all about sex like most guys I've dated in the past. Although I really do care for him and I know he feels the same, I find myself being very insecure and negative about our relationship. Although he is trustworthy, I am always thinking that he is lying or cheating on me even though I have no proof.

20090309134455AAnU8cI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is dating....?	yeah, we've been married 21 years, so if you're married less than 10 and want to tell me to get counseling and be more loving, move on to the next question.      21 years, 3 kids, 8 moves...husband isn't a happy man - has grown pessimistic and negative over the years, and doesn't particularly like being a father, but he generally does an adequate job.  I've major issues when with him when he is not doing an adequate job.        We don't have sex anymore.  I initiated for over 5 years (exclusively - he never asked once), and finally gave up for that and another reason that I won't go into.      We have avoided sleeping in the same bed for over 6 months, and generally I end up on the couch.      In years past, he has had women he has been interested in.  I know he's met them for dinner or drinks - I guess you could say dates.  No sex - I'm 100% sure of that despite the fact that he never asked for sex from me and I used to get tested every year at my annual exam.  The truth is, life is too hard for this guy.  He stresses over everything, and feels overwhelmed most of the time.  He never, ever relaxes.      I'm fairly certain he is "dating" again.  A woman at work keeps emailing him and asking about when will they go out for suishi.  Another woman has asked him to go out for drinks, and he just met another woman for lunch and lied to me about who he was having lunch with.  He says they are all business, but why is it always one on one??  Nah, he's dating.      I have mixed feelings about this.  Part of me doesn't care, but part of me does.  He won't do counseling - no way.  Can anyone give me some insight?

Also, our 4yr do not like to share his momy with no one he says mommy is mine.We just got custody of my 14yr ‘cause her mom was abusing her and she was on tons of different medications. My wife is nice to my daughter but does not spend as much time with her. She says she does not know what to do with 14yr, my wife is 11yr older than my daughter. I just want my wife to be great mom like she is to our 5yr

20090309134953AAkkjqI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are his talks of marriage and family directed toward me?	I've been dating a very wonderful man now for four months. We have been moving along at a nice even pace and seem to be on the same page. He hass began to express his interest in being married and having a family. I care for him very much and he for me. We've started cooking at home and doing very "couple-y" things. I have expressed the same interests. So how much of what he says can I take to mean he wants these things with me?

20090309134354AABNJ5B	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm in a serious fight with my husband,please help!!?	My husband and his mom are always at each others throats.   My husband is in therapy and the therapist told him that his mom is abusive and that he should remove himself from her life. I don't know what he told his therapist but,it seems like a 2 way street to me. She is a WONDERFUL grandma to our 28 month old son. It would break my sons little heart if he did'nt see her. My husband has now banned HIS family including our son from seeing her. I told him that my child is a person not a pawn or a weapon and that I will not allow him to be used as such in some foolish mind game. I work evenings and his mother babysits. I have continued to take my son over to his mom's house. My husband is now FURIOUS with me. Am I in the right or the wrong?
20090309133556AArcJEc	Family & Relationships;Friends	It is okay for me to ask a teacher..?	This may seem like a stupid question, but I am uncertain about it. I have become close to a teacher recently and we talk a lot and I really care about her. I noticed today that she seemed a bit out of sorts, and I am worrying if she is alright. Is it alright for me to ask her how she is doing or why she seemed upset? Or is this crossing some kind of line between students and teachers?

20090309134018AAEPLwS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could he like me at all?	So there's this guy I like, but I don't know if he likes me.   We're both sixteen and at the same school, but he's the captain of the basketball team and I'm the head of the drama club (I know, how cliche.)       But in the two classes we have together he insists on sitting next to me (as in he will kick people out of the seat next to me if they take it first), always ensures that we're partners for things, we have all sorts of stuff in common (music & movie taste, same religious views...) && he'll randomly reach over and play with my hair or grab my hand or stuff like that.       Also, we have the same homeroom teacher and she's told me that we'd be a cute couple. Could he like me? And if he does, how do I get it across that I like him too? I've only been in one relationship and it lasted four years, so I'm sort of emotionally behind one that level.      THANKS!

20090309134229AAbMSfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats up with these guys ? Guy problems !?	There are these guys that me and my friends were involved with about 8 months ago. My friend was hooking up with one of them untill he tried to pressure her into something she did not want  to do. They used to harrass us and call us bad names ( i.e.: the c bomb ) and spread stuff about us. Heres the catch, now they try talking to us, and people tell us they are always talking about us ( not in bad ways). They started complimenting us the other day, but yet they still talk about us with another GIRL in a bad way. Everyone says they are with this girl to use her ( which wouldnt surprise me at all, we all know its true) . Everyone tell this to says that they are trying to make us jelous and still want us. Also I told one of them that I didnt like there new style, and he changed it.    I know how immature this sounds but its all so confusing and hard to understand. We really are not immature at all, but yet were in this situation.

20090309134322AA0lgsW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need help reporting abusive marine Husband?	My husband and I filed for divorce ten months ago. he was physically abusive many times and he was cheating, I found out he had girlfriend for two months. I left and reported to his sergant and his reply was;" There is no way he could of done that." Few months went by and he started harrassing me so i went to his sergant major and reported it, it seemed to stop. So recently I found out that the divorce papers had been rejected and he has had them for three months. he is not filing them because he is receiving $3,000 a month for BAH and being married to me and claiming me as dependent. By claiming me he has messed with taxes and i now owe goverment $600. I have contacted his sergant, sergant major and 1st Sergent to no use. Them won't help because its one of their own now I'm behind on medical and mental bills and he is getting all this money. How is it fair that I get no support but I'm in intesive therapy because of him.    I need help I'm at my wits end and no one on base will help because I'm only his wife. If anything I want to report his behavior so he can get brig time.

20090309134856AAdJ49u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it a mistake? I need honest opinions. Boys and Girls.?	I got myself in an online relationship with a guy who lived in another country. He's older than me and was very much successful with his career. We fell madly in love with each other and was just absolutely happy with each other's company. He even saved money to come and visit me here.      When we met, we were so much happy and excited to see each other. Half of the day we got into a serious conversation about how we were going to work when I needed to stay in my own country and him with his. Until we came into a painful conclusion that it won't work simply because we wouldn't be able to focus on our real lives and just want time to be online. Be frustrated about the whole distance thing especially when we encounter physical needs (hugging, kissing, etc.)      He leaves and heads back to his country. Arriving at his country, he communicates with me again saying he thinks maybe he has made the biggest mistake of his life. We both try to part and do our own thing. Christmas time came and he sends me messages that he still loves me. But we both just can't sum up the courage to plan. On my part, I can't find enough strength because plainly he broke my heart for giving up and leaving.      Now months passed and I have tried to focus on my life. I recently messaged him saying that we both know we were still in love with each other and are still somehow saving ourselves (by being single and available) but that I cannot do it anymore. Because I feel I am just daily torturing myself when I know I can be happy. I wanted him to say something like "We'll find each other again" or "We'll meet each other again" but he didn't.      And so I deleted him from my contacts. Celfone and emails and IMs. Was it a mistake deleting my communication with him? Should I truly move on or is there something on his part am not seeing?
20090309134654AAb4RSL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Guys, i need your opinions could he like me as more than a friend?	i'm a little confused.  we've been friends for a couple of years now.  i've been going to his parties a lot more lately.  last time i saw him he'd just broken up with his girlfriend.        at some point we both ended up alone in the hallway.  he approached me and asked me to kiss him.  i hesitated a lot.  he said he knew that i used to have a crush on him, as if that were a reason should kiss him.       we kissed for a few seconds till someone came out of the room, i went back in, then later i gave him some of my drink and he kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room.       then later that night, in front of several of our friends.  he was like "i just remembered something, i almost forgot.  remember a couple hours ago"  and i was like "what" and he was like "you know what i'm talking about.  and then he was like "it was weird, right?"  i'm not sure if he wanted me to agree with him, or tell him no, i didn't think it was weird.        i know he's probably confused because he had just broken up with his first serious relationship, but i feel as though we've always had some kind of attraction to each other.   opinions?

20090309150227AABw4py	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many chances should I give him till it's over for good?	I met this guy about 2 years ago, and we dated off and on for those past years. We've been through some rough times, but always got through them and still like each other a lot. He had dated other girls when we were on breaks, but I never did. Well lately, we aren't dating but are still talking to each other like we practically were. Anyways, we recently got in this huge fight about him being all over another girl. When I confronted him in person about it, he said that he didn't like her, that they didn't do anything and that the only thing he wanted was me. So me being dumb, I believed it.. and then come to find he lied! I had 4 people tell me, including the girl before he told me that he was doing stuff with her. I had to ask him about it and I told him it's a little too late to say sorry.. See now, if he would have told me the truth straight up I wouldn't have cared as much as I do now because were not dating.. He just had to lie.. Then I got an email from him saying it was an honest mistake, and that he told the girl he doesn't want anything in her, and that he only did it cause he thought I "lost interest" in him.. Now in it, it says forgive him! BUT, I did forgive him.. and i've always after every thing he's ever done to hurt me.. I've tried many times to not like him, but I can't help it! Cause when I don't have him, Im always down.. He honestly keeps me going through the day.. So im really frustated and hurt, and just ugh I've been crying about it for the past few days.. Im so bad with second chances, but I can't help it cause I honestly like him a lot.. I never thought I would meet anyone like him, I feel like he is everything I've ever wanted! :( And I know he never intended to hurt me, it always seems to end up that way though. I've given him multiple chances. Should I give up, move on? Or give him another chance.. Just give me your input on this. Thanks..

20090309135431AA64RSv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE answer!?!? What if my mom won't let me date him because he comes with so much "Baggage?!?!?!"?	Ok, well, about 4 months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've basically become best friends since then, but I've liked him as more than a friend for a while... So this weekend, I finally let him know that I like him as more than a friend, and he said he liked me back... But anyways, he's very emotional, and he's metro... A lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms, and because he's really into fashion and stuff... But I think the reason he's so emotional is because of his past... His parents both got shot in an awful accident when he was very young... And worst, he saw it happen... So he's lived with every family member (But he seemed to keep losing everyone he loved), and he's been in foster care (Still is, but may be adopted.) He's never had a stable home... It's awful, but he's a very strong person, because he's still so positive and everything. He's a really loving person, and very touchy-feely. So today, there was no school, and he came over, and we went for a walk, and he kissed me. <3 lol But the thing is, my mom doesn't know we're dating yet... She loves Nathaniel... but that's with him being just my friend... She's said that having a relationship with someone like him isn't good, because they come with so much "baggage," and such a hard past, that the emotions and everything make the relationship too hard and almost impossible to keep going... But Nathaniel doesn't seem like the kind of person who would let his emotions from what happened get in the way... I honestly think that us being together, either as friends, or dating, is good for him because... well, he just needs someone to love him... And I want to be that person... What if my mom won't let me date him, though? I really, really like him, and I'm SO happy that we told each other how we feel... what should I do?!?! What do you think??
20090309144549AArmnTx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Your best pick up line?	hahaha    i want to hear the best one you know.      dont waist your time with sending links, i wont read them
20090309145632AA8Zyjb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really need the advise please help 10 points for the best answer?	i really like this girl, and i asked her out by text (i had my reasons) anyway after i asked her out she didnt seem to text me as much and it was me texting her to meet up and after a while i meet up with her again but she started to do jelousy things inffront of me like mentioning ex boyfriends and saying she invited 2 other boys to her birthday and that she could only take 2 people her best friends and yet only about 5 weeks before she had said im her new best friend. and she was saying things like when i got intimate with my ex boyfriend i would have to take her dog out the room cause he would start barking and that her next boyfriend will have to get past her dog before going out with her, and yet on other occations shes said her dog seems to really like me. anyway my dad interferred and sent her a valantines card which had a clue that made it obviose that it was from me she then followed to ignore me for a whole week and wasnt replying to my texts in the end she did and i told her the valantines card wasnt from me, she then invited me down hers on and she started talking about that she would love to get married and that she wants a rich husband and that she would want him to ask her to marry him within 4 years of going out or she would walk away and that she would like to get marryed then divorced then remarried to the same person just for the drama. wtf all that about the next day i went to the photograpy class which both me and her go to and she said had dressed up, and on are way back from photography she was mentioning her earings and was mentioning her clothes and that it didnt cost much what she is wearing, i mean she had come with large earings on loads of rings on a pink skirt and different boads and special tight things, anyway when we got to her house she didnt invite me in like she usually does and said see you when i see you and walked in. after i left her i text her saying would she like to go to starbucks which she said on her way back from photograpy that she did, she then replyed saying she was busy now i replyed saying never mind btw you looked nice today i said this because i thought she may have got funny and not invited me in because i hadnt said this. she then follwed to ignore me again the next 2 days when i text her saying if shed like to meet up, so i decided to send her a text which i regreat saying "why are you being so funny, what is the problem, you seem to be ignoring me and never invite me around anymore, what are your feeling on this" she didnt reply but i saw her the next day, as me and a friend of both mine and hers (luke) were going to a bithday party and me luke and her were walking down together. anyway she was really angry with me she didnt talk to me all the way down and only talked to luke, she said i was creepy walking inbetween them, she then said i was kinda strange before we walked down as well we were watching tv and this guy came up and kissed a girl on an advert with no warning, and she turned around and said i wish a hot guy could do that to me,and then said not both of you though.she also said that she wants someone who can handle her and that luke and this other person can and that im nowere near there she then when on about the guys she likes eg tall, dark hear which btw im not, she then was saying to luke that she thinks i may be gay but not realise yet, and that she could set me up with one of her gay guys, she then said she missed her ex boyfriend because he knew how to handle her. she was bassicly being a bully towards me. after this i didnt contact her for a week and missed the photography class she and i do and after a while i sent her a text saying sorry about the text i sent you a few last week, are we still friends she text back on another number saying "hey, its jeni, im using my mums phone as have no credit, yeh we are still friends" i replyed the next day saying sorry to hear you are not well, hope you are better soon, are you up to a short visit if your not feeling too unwell" btw luke told me that day that she had just been told she got chicken pox, anyway she didnt reply to this and i havent contacted her since its now been 4 days since this, please take into note that she didnt act like this before i asked her out only once i asked her out. what should i do what has all this been about. i still dont know why she has been ignoring me and why she has been doing what appears to be jelousy games since i asked her out and why after i sent her the text saying why are you being so funny what is the problem on the saturday on the way to the birthday party she called me gay, she must no im not gay as i asked her out about 7 weeks ago. what should i do and why has she done this. she acted like all this since i asked her out and she recieved the valantines card thing. please help really need the advise and sorry for the question being sooo long.

I don't know why. I can't ever talk to her. I'll talk to her if she talks to me but I won't start a conversation. I'll text her and talk without a problem. One of my best friends(a guy) has a crush on her so we chill with her when ever we can. I'm def not jealous of her, she is really really really cute but i'm not the jealous type. I don't l like her, but it sure would be fun to make out with her;). But I won't because my best friends likes her and I could never hurt him. Well unless he said it was okay, But that is not the point.   Why do I get so shy around her?

20090309140009AAdDDt6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I got her number, but shes out of my league, what should i do?	(asked before, but question was deleted...)   to sum it up i met this girl at a bar friday night. she was about to leave but somehow ended up staying another hour and hanging out with me. we had a very good convo. i compliemented her by telling her she was pretty. i asked her why a pretty girl like her was talking to me and she said because im nice and im cute. keep in mind we were drunk. we kissed in the bar, and outside before she left i made out with her. i got her number, she told me she would answer if i called, and said we should get together sometime. but i cant help feel after all of that, that she is out of my league and isnt interested in me. i did call her yesterday, she answered but she was sick so we agreed that i would call back today. and she said she has to work so if she doesnt answer, to definitely leave a message. she was very pretty, and on that fact alone is why i dont see how she could see anything in me, and it was all just a drunk night at a bar. should i still try to get a date with her or let it go?
20090309144515AAOoUiK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever not pursued someone because you thought they were out of your league?

20090309142253AArXIEg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she doing this???...?	A girl I know in one of my classes likes a boy in one of her classes.(I found out about this through a friend that has her for that class). We are friends, and we talk almost everyday. We usually dont have long conversations. But ever since January, I have noticed she has been looking at me. At first I didnt pay attention to it. But now, it happens EVERYDAY. Whenever I catch her, she quickly looks away, or sometimes she'll keep staring, and we'll hold eye contact for about 4-5 seconds. Ive asked her why does she look at me like that, and she said she looks at people randomly, but I feel like she's lying to me. I dont mind this, but it seems pretty awkward, as we are both friends and we dont talk about it. Plus she likes that boy in one of her classes. So why does she look at me that way?. Its one of the weirdest situations Ive ever been in.
20090309150307AAtlmRw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What will it be like with my LDR ends?	So I've been with my boyfriend for about 3 years. We met in college and were together for a little over a year together. He then transferred colleges and for the last 21 months or so we've been long distance and see each other for a weekend ever month or two. It has been going for the most part wonderfully. I'm about to graduate and will be living in the same city as him and I'm actually getting nervous. I'm afraid that we're now so used to each other from far away that we are going to have a hard time seeing each other more often. It seems strange, I know. I'm just worried that we'll get on each others nerves more quickly. (Right now this usually starts to happen by about Sunday when we spend the weekend together due to the fact that we spend that time 27/7 together in a place where we can't afford to give ourselves a little break during the visit from each other.)      Has anyone been in this situation and how did it go/how did you handle it?

I work over 70 hours a week, sometimes more for 6 straight days. I work from 12pm-12am monday through saturday. I don't have time to hang out with my friends or do things that I would like to do. I feel depressed all the time when i come into work, not because i don't enjoy my job, but because i'm exhausted all the time.       In case anyone is wondering I don't get paid overtime and I only get paid a $100 a week for 70+hour work (I work for my father, and I'm supposebly the manager.) I don't know if that is legal, but I'm only doing it to help my family. My mother is sick and my father is not feeling well either, but its just so frustrating. I know what I should do, but I just want to know what anyone else would do if they were in my situation.

20090309150027AATfLrT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said he likes me a lot, but he has a girlfriend. What should I do?	I've liked this guy since about October and everyone always told me that he liked me too. Neither of us ever made a move. But on Friday, I finally got sick of waiting and got a mutual friend to just tell him that I liked him. When she told him, he smiled, but had no other reaction. Today, she reminded him of their conversation and he said, "I really like her a lot, but I'm in a relationship right now."       It makes me mad because I'd been seeing him with a girl, that I didn't know around school. I guess that's his girlfriend. Anyway, my friends keep telling me I should get over him. Or they say I should break them up. They say he'll probably break up with her for me. But I don't want him to. I wouldn't want to be in her position if that happened.       Ugh. I'm so confused.

20090309144651AA9TENp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I might like my guy friend?	I think I might like my guy friend, I'm not really sure.   I was under the impression my guy friend was going to ask a girl from another school that he liked to prom. So I was completely surprised when he asked me. He did not clarify if we are going as friends or more. He asked me right before other people arrived to hang out, so after I said yes I hardly had a chance to say anything else.      Ever since then I've had butterflies in my stomach when I see him, and I haven't been able to act normally like I use to around him.   Now, I've never really been in a relationship before, so I'm wondering if I'm just getting caught up in the moment, or if I like him.    I never really thought of him that way since we are such good friends. Should I let it go and ignore the feelings or try to pursue something?

20090309143919AAfrlXR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can someone help with this...Is she crazy or what?	My Ex Wife and I just recently concluded with our divorce in July after being separated for 3 years. At the end of July she called me on several occasions asking me to forgive and to try get back together and work on raising our 4 year old together as a family. Due to what I endured while married to her I declined to reconcile our broken relationship. She put me through a great deal such as verbal, physical, and emotional abuse - Constantly threatening to revoking her petition for me to obtain my green card if I did not comply with what she wanted to do. By the way, we did not marry for the greencard, but she used it as a way to maintain control over. She know how much I cared about our 3 month old son and knew that I couldnt just easily leave the relationship if I wanted to. The situation was just out of hand to the point it took one more incident where she was battering me and when I went to leave for good she called the cops on to accuse me of battering her and or 3 year old son. When the two women cops showed up I thought that I was going to jail - but they didnt believe a word she said ....she claimed that she paid the rent on the apt we live in...When they asked where she worked she said she was going to school - They asked me what I did and I said I'm an accountant. They looked at ther to see if there was any signs of me beating her they found none - I was almost double her size and yet they found no signs of bruisings...wierd huh?! After that incident I didnt want any part of her anymore. She tried begging to for me to change my mind, but it was too late. She has made my life extremely difficult even after our separation. And recently to my surprise this last July'08 she was once again asking for us to get back together and I declined as I knew how it felt to be with her..AND IT WASNT PLEASANT!!! Now she called a week ago claiming that she plans on moving out of state. I currently spend time with our son every other weekend......What do u think??? Is she mentally imbalance or what? Please help!!

20090309141844AAkPH1v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy weird or...?	I've been with this guy for over a year and a half now, I met him on MSN, he was 17 and i was 14 and now he is 18 and i am 15, and I love him and hate him at the same time because he's so damn childish.. he claims to love me      Also, my best friend for 4 years now was talking to him on msn and she and her twin told me that he had said to her that she is attractive and that she made him sexually excited.   I know that I believe my friends, but he completely denies it.      Plus, after 2 days of talking to him when we first met he put his webcam on and started humping the door and rubbing his crotch infront of the cam..       ALSO!   He was having a long distance internet relationship with another girl called Stephanie, and he told her he loved her, and she told me that he was doing all this pervy stuff to her on cam too.. I think he really seems like a paedo..      And around a week after talking to him he randomly told me he was going to come to where I live and rape me and went through all the details in how he would.. which was aparently a joke.      He wants me to meet him but I'm not sure because I don't know if i trust him or if he really is a paedo that will rape me.      He really doesn't seem like a paedophile when you talk to him, he still lives with his mum, dad and brother and has the mental age of a 3 year old?

20090309140238AA9HkEB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend, still has his house exactly as it was when his wife died 3 years ago, he claims for his son, 34?	I'm 45, he's 66, and everything in his house is exactly the same as it was when his  wife died 3 years ago, her jewery still out, pictures, clothes still in the closet, perfume still in the bathroom, I mean it's as if she is still there, and he can't understand why I don't want to go over there.   We've been dating almost a year, and I've told him, that he needs to take all her stuff and give it to his son, who is 34, and he claims he keeps it that way because of his son, which only visits once a year, doesn't even live in the same state.  Am I wrong that he's not moving on, because I told him, I'm not waiting around anymore, that he's not over her, and he shouldn't be involved with me if he's not, and he tells me I saved his life, that if I left him he would die, ect, which to me is manipulation, which I told him he would not die, he would go on, but he needs to move on with his life and I know it's very hard to lose someone like that but if he wants me in his life, he has to move on.  I don't know what the grieving process or how long it takes, but I know, I am still young and have men asking me out all the time and I turn them down because I love him, I'm not in love, and he does treat me really well, but, every since I met him, the longer we are together and he keeps all her things around, which I just quit going over there, he comes to my place, it's literally making me a nervous wreck, why, I don't know, well, I do know one reason, I am not sexually attracted to him even though he is nice looking and looks younger than his age.  When we met, he came up to me, talking and I thought he was younger which he thought I was in my twenties, which at first I thought was flattering, but I have twin daughters 21,  and he's always talking how pretty young girls are, which now kinda gives me the creeps, not that I think he's a pervert, but it just seems as though the more we see each other the more I tell him I'm working more, just so I don't have to see him because he wants sex all the time, and I just don't want it with him, and no I havn't cheated, but I know I still want other guys when I see a nice looking one, and I have gone through early menapause.  My family loves him, and they think I would be a fool to let him go, but, he makes me nervous with wanting the sex all the time, and I've told him, and he says sex, not make love and I told him as long as we've been together, it's make love not sex, don't call it that  and also, when he introduces me to people he starts out talking about his dead wife then says, this is my girl now, "girl", which he calls me his "girl", and I told him quit calling me girl, I'm a woman and don't like being called a girl, which he said it's only a saying, which I guess to him I am a girl, he's almost 67next month and that's 22 years difference so in reality I guess I am a girl to him, don't get me wrong, he's really sweet, and kind and loving, but my stomach is always in knots lately.  I guess I never thought it would last this long, and now he says he couldn't go on without me, and I don't want to hurt him, because he is so sweet, but I can't quit dodging sex all the time, and I do want it just not with him, gosh I know this sounds crazy, but am I wrong to tell him it's time to let go of his dead wife and  get rid or at least put her things away? Help please I need some advice

20090309145952AATQGFj	Family & Relationships;Family	He has started hitting me, what can I do?	My husband verbally mentally and physically abuses me. I've kept records of every time it's physically happened in written form with dates and information, i've even taken some pictures of bruises etc. I don't mind the mental abuse, but it's really hard to take the physical stuff. When I first met him, he never did any of these things to me, but literally the day after he married me it started.   The problem is that I'm too scared to actually gain the courage to leave, for one thing, I really really love the man I married, and keep convincing myself everytime that he'll change. The other problem is that he has sociopathic tendencies, lack of remorse etc, so when he hits me, he always manages to convince me logically that it was my fault, because I provoked him in some fashion, he's even keeping his own diary after the hits happen explaining how I provoked them each time with terrible behavior towards him that just drove him to hurt me, and that if only i'd be better behaved, that he'd never have to hit me again. I'm too scared to tell the police, because I know that if I went to court, i'd never win, he's too charming and clever with his words, no one would ever believe me! i'm 19, he's 37, I can't drive or anything, I have no money or a job, he married me in England and took me to America where i've been away from my family and education etc. I don't know anyone over here in the states, I stay at home all day while he works, i'm even dependent on him for food, If I left I'd have no one to go to. Apart from his phsyical abuse, he is the perfect guy, he is super nice to his ex wife, and the perfect dad to his son, it's only me he ever hits, and I don't understand why :(  I really do love time with him, and when he isn't abusing, he is he nicest guy you'd ever meet, vegetarian, against animal abuse etc, I know my family would buy me a plane ticket back to London, but i'm too scared to tell them :(  Is there anything else I can do??? His grandmother is sick so he is going to Texas to visit her, and I'm staying home alone for the week, so this would be the perfect time to leave if I could push myself to do it. p.s I don't have any kids or anything like that with him, it's just me living here.

20090309160417AAa1vrJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it wrong for my mom to make these excuses?	sometimes my mom goes to the casino to gamble and she say shes going to be back in 4hours and then shes gone for like 14 hours straight. then shes comes back and i find out that she lost. then shes tell me that me and my sister don't want to hang with her anymore so she goes off to the casino and shes says she feels empty. what really made me mad is when i told her that she needed God in her life she sayd "who cares about God" i maen come on through out all the years me and my sis spent time with her. we did not miss a single vacation with her and we massaged her when she didn't feel good. it's like shes being selfish and she wants us all to her self. i mean for God's sake i'm 19 in college and my sis is like 20 trying to transfer to to the university of the pacific for engineering but we need the money to help my sis transfer because my mom is single and doesn't get child support and my mom is like gambling money away. i maen even if she lost 40 bucks, that coulda been half of the money spent for my sister or other things. do you think that's such a lame excuse? saying that she goes to the casino because we don't want to hang out with her? i mean just seeing her all depressed is making me feel depressed.

He always asks his friends where I am. And every time he cracks a joke he'll look at me to see how I react.       Thank you!

20090309150757AAyc4Fi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE just answer?!?!?! He comes with a hard past?!?!?!?	Ok, well, about 4 months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've basically become best friends since then, but I've liked him as more than a friend for a while... So this weekend, I finally let him know that I like him as more than a friend, and he said he liked me back... But anyways, he's very emotional, and he's metro... A lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms, and because he's really into fashion and stuff... But I think the reason he's so emotional is because of his past... His parents both got shot in an awful accident when he was very young... And worst, he saw it happen... So he's lived with every family member (But he seemed to keep losing everyone he loved), and he's been in foster care (Still is, but may be adopted.) He's never had a stable home... It's awful, but he's a very strong person, because he's still so positive and everything. He's a really loving person, and very touchy-feely. So today, there was no school, and he came over, and we went for a walk, and he kissed me. <3 lol But the thing is, my mom doesn't know we're dating yet... She loves Nathaniel... but that's with him being just my friend... She's said that having a relationship with someone like him isn't good, because they come with so much "baggage," and such a hard past, that the emotions and everything make the relationship too hard and almost impossible to keep going... But Nathaniel doesn't seem like the kind of person who would let his emotions from what happened get in the way... I honestly think that us being together, either as friends, or dating, is good for him because... well, he just needs someone to love him... And I want to be that person... What if my mom won't let me date him, though? I really, really like him, and I'm SO happy that we told each other how we feel... what should I do?!?! What do you think??

My crush sits to my right side and one seat in front of me (to my right upper corner). I flirt with her a lot and she flirts too so today I was sitting there and the teacher was talking blah blah and she started doodling on her worksheet. She drew a heart and colored it in and positioned the paper in a way I could easily see it. After 2-4 seconds she flipped the paper over quickly and started doodling other girl things like a sun and dots. Did this mean anything, I always feel like she does things that are meant for me but I don't know. She dressed nicely today in a new outfit as well.

20090309152153AAzcN4P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he is forseeing a future with me?	This guy & I have been friends for awhile, & have been more serious about each other since around last October. We've been doing the long distance since then, since I live in St. Louis & he lives in Chicago. We visit each other as much as we can, but it gets hard at times. We are exclusive yet we don't label each other gf/bf, as of yet because of the distance. But we've also said we do love each other. I asked him today (since I wasn't feeling sure "of us") & asked him, are you still in this? He asked what it meant & I told him that the distance is getting to me more i guess, but that I'm trying. He said back, he knows & he is human too. then I asked him what he wants to do or how do we approach this & that having an answer is better than guessing. He said back, "one day at a time" I told him that's fair enough & that I really miss him, he said he feels the same. Then I told him it's good to hear & that I'm still refusing people because I want to stick with him, he said back "I understand" So with all of that said, is he reassuring me that there is a definite future with us but has to take his time, & how long do I wait?

But I'm thinking he likes me, but here are some signs.   1-he teases me such as poking or taking my binder, holding it out of reach or holding my pencil so I have to grab his hand.   2-he always comes and talks to me.   3-sometimes if he really wants to talk he'll put both hands on my shoulders and say "Okay, Adair," and say what he was going to say.   4-When I leave a class that has him in it, he'll run up to me and say "Adair, who do you have next?" and I tell him and he says "Oh ask her if she remembers me" and he always tells me everyday if I forget to ask her. He walks with me a bit to talk then turns around to go to his class.   And other things too.   Sooooo, what do you YAers think?   (by the way, we're thirteen.)   ;D
20090309153837AAt5qk5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am venting, could someone please read?	I am 16 and never had a BF....i feel like a waste, even though i know i am not.       The guy i like has been metaphorically screwed over by my good friend twice.    but he doesn't dislike me because of that.      Before he got screwed over by her the 2nd time, he liked me...but i didn't like him back. so i feel like it's partly my fault for him getting hurt the second time.         but now i like him, but i don't know if he likes my other friend, or this girl i HATE.       fgjkjfdghakjdflgjkgbcvkbn i am so mad and upset and sad.

So I found out that my ex was talking trash about me and I told him I was sorry I ever associated myself with him.

20090309160226AAkv9ZV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I know that he likes me?	So there is this boy , I like and I think he might like me. The only thing is that I don't want to go up to him and ask. But, hes always friendly with me and I know that he like talking to me. We both take the bus together in the morning, and he always says hi to me. If i don't notice him he yells something out to attract my attention. He jokingly touches my hair and always makes sweet jokes about me? What do you think?      (And last year in the bus he was looking at me for about 3-4 minutes aand as soon as I looked up he looked away. He did the same thing in class)>

20090309163703AA4Ytua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me? Help me please!?	Ok, so I like this guy named Myles. Myles knows that I like him. So do two of my friends. I've been wondering if he likes me for a while. He's one year younger than me, and two grades below.   We've talked on facebook a bit. The first time, he actually initiated the conversation by saying hello. I said hey, he got off a little later, and came back on about an hour later. I asked him why he said hello and he said 'idk, maybe i felt like it at the time. should i not say hello to you anymore' and I said no, and I was just wondering why.   When I told my best guy friend about this conversation (he didn't know it was Myles at that point but he found out later that day), he said that when Myles said hello, he was putting himself out there.   The other day, on facebook, I said hey, he said 'you like germany' (he must have been looking at my profile). Then we were talking about Germany for a bit. He tried to ask if I can speak German in German. I answered in German, and said how it could be corrected. He said, 'wow, im impressed' Later, I had a notification that he had tagged me in a note (25 Random Things). Then he signed off.   We have one class together, band. The other day, Myles saw a bit of another side of me... Normally I'm insanely quiet and stuff. I was talking to my best friend across the music room. Throughout our conversation, Myles was there and I think he was listening a bit, and he seemed to have a bit of a smile/smirk on his face. That's like the first time that I've been like that near him.   The other day, I was walking in the halls, and there weren't many people in the halls, I was heading one way, and as I was passing Myles, he looked up, I smiled, and he returned the smile.   Yesterday, a few minutes before the bell rang for the end of the day, Myles and I made eye contact for maybe two seconds...   The other night we were talking on facebook, and he said 'you looked nice today, if you dont mind me saying' then I said 'oh, thanks' and then he said 'haha, not to be random or anything'. (I told two of my friends this, one guy, one girl. The girl said 'awwwwwwwwwwww that just like made my day' and the guy said 'good for you' and 'wonderful'. They both know I like him... more the guy than the girl.)   Most of the time when we talk on facebook, it's because I said hey first. He's said something first twice... And sometimes when I say hey, he doesn't say anything back.   The other day, I was signed on to facebook, but I wasn't actually there (I was idle I guess) and Myles said 'heyy'   And we don't really have any mutual friends... But one of my friends has a brother who is friends with Myles.   Do you think he likes me? And if he does, why do you think he hasn't made a move or anything yet?   Ok, and if you think he does like me, and you think I should do something, what can I do? I have no idea what to do. Neither of us can legally drive (alone that is) and I'm the shy, quiet, laid back kind of girl...   THANK YOU SO MUCH

20090309155119AAbHBh3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kissing someone after they've been smoking weed?	Hi, I was just wondering what it tastes like to kiss someone after they've been smoking weed. I already know what it tastes like for cigarettes.. And I hate it. Absolutely disgusting for me.   But I've never tried with someone who smokes weed.       I would like to know:    - In your opinion does it taste nice (whilst your kissing)?   - Does it put you off kissing your girl/boyfriend?   - Did weed slowly become priority for him/her?   - Did they change? (eg: listening: Did they listen less)      Hope you can help?

20090227151838AAtLkQR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Spoke with my mother-in-law for 1st time in a year and about estranged husband, should I listen to her?	we mainly talked about how the kids are doing and how she's glad I am doing so well (kids too). She said she hates it that things are not working out with my estranged hubby, but she says maybe it will change once we start talking again. We haven't spoken in more than a year.       I'm planning to visit this summer, for the kids' sake. She mentioned that she is REALLY excited about the visit and she says my estranged husband would be glad to see the kids....and me.       Would he really want to?       I told her that I believe he would just be happy to see the kids and that the visit is about them and that I would most likely not want to see or talk to him unless it's about getting back together, getting a divorce, or any important legal information about the kids.      Should I just take her advice with a grain of salt?      She said that maybe when we start talking, things will change.

20090227151820AAeI0hd	Family & Relationships;Family	My Dad talks too much...getting to the breaking point?	As a sophomore in High School, after only meeting my father 2 years ago (Mother kind of lied to me about him)...I find myself dreading going over his house, and/or talking to him on the phone.       He's a good guy, but I just can't take it anymore. He rambles on and on, all about stories about how stupid people are or what he did that day, or what he did ALL WEEK while I was "avoiding" him or playing phone tag.       He will sit there and tell me completely pointless, or unfunny stories, which he thinks is funny. I just sit there and either wander my eyes around or stare and "uh huh..mhm...ha...ha...funny.." etc. He never gets the message that he's been talking way too much, and rarely stops to ask me how I am or how my week went, at least not after he's done rambling on and on about his life.      I never really get to participate in many conversations with him. I just took it as "Aha, he talks a lot. Oh well." But now its got me dreading being around him at all. Its actually destroying our relationship!       Anyone have this problem? How can I get the message across without being rude? He'll drop me off at my house, and come in and blab on and on to my mother for literally hours. He corners people with words, and its got me pulling out my hair.

He states at me, like intensly stares at me with real wide eyes just to annoy me and he's always telling me I'm hot.       Well my best guy friend now started helping him out to annoy me. Like passing on messages from him and making fun of me about it all. But he told me yesterday that they don't really make fun of me and I am cute and have a nice personality. Anddd that the kid is like a second grader who pulls on a girls hair because he likes her.       I personally don't know what to believe right now...

I rarely ever see him, I only saw him once during the summer, but now I started seeing him again. In the summer, we were talking, and I never saw him again until now. When he comes around, we make eye contact, but he doesn't say anything to me. I guess he doesn't remember me.    Anyways, next time I see him I'm going to start talking to him again, only this time I want to get his #. I've never asked a guy for his number before ever so it's going to be akward for me. I want to tell him that I want to hang out, but I don't wanna be like "Let's hang out sometime." That's being too direct. I wanna like say it in a way that he will still understand that I wanna hang out with him. What should I do? How do I let him know I'm interested? We're in our teens.

I seen her about 40 times now lol. Whenever I wait for the elevator she is waiting as well and than I'm scared to talk to her because I dunno if she likes or dislikes me because we never talked in that 40 times just simple "Hello" "Thanks" and what not probably because I always have my speakers at loud [phone speakers] (music) What would you do? How would you start the conversation?      I am 16.

20090309162120AAWUQsW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for the ladies?	Ok so my wife dug through the history on our computer and found that a few times and I mean few ( I think it was 4) I visited a porn site and watched a little freakiness going on. She freaked out on me and said that meant I thought she wasn't good enough for me etc, etc. I told her it was no big deal she was out of town at those times and I needed to take care of a little business eh hm. So imagine my surprise when I'm transferring all of our stuff on to a new computer I just bought when low and behold I stumble across a few sites she has visited and tried to delete and or hide away in some what she thought were locked files! The kicker is she railed me for watching straight porn and I find out she's been looking a little more than a few times (15 that I found) at gay male on male porn! When I confronted her she said it was no big deal she was curious about it and just looked once or twice! She was upset that I watched another woman and here she is watching two, three and four ugh other guys! Is that a normal fantasy for women? Do you ladies really like that kind of thing? She told me she didn't really like it because it was "so gross" and now shes saying she barely ever looked at it and didn't do anything when she did see it! What is the deal with this?

20090227152220AAkMN2T	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I say to my sister to show her I do not support her unhealthy relationship without creating distance?	My sister has been in a relationship for nearly 2 years- every 1-3 months, he kicks her out (locks her outside with no keys, and puts all her belongings out with her), I pick her up and she stays with me or our mom until he decides to "let" her come back.  They are in the middle of one of their "break ups" now, but she has admitted that when he wants her to come back this time, she will.  I just CAN NOT see her do this anymore, but don't want to "abandon" her.  I have tried talking to her, telling her she deserves better, offering my emotional and financial support, but she always goes back.  What can I do?
20090227152638AA8IoBC	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help talking to my parents about this?	I've told my parents about a million times that I want to go to acting schools and classes so that I can get into the acting business. It's my dream, and what I've always wanted forever. But, I really don't think they understand. I feel like they don't believe that I'm serious about it, but I feel so uncomfortable talking to them about it. I don't know how to approach them. It's not that they're not supportive of me, it's just that I think that they think I'm not serious about it, and I know I am because it's all I think about. And, I haven't been able to do any school plays because I'm in cheerleading and the schedules don't work out together, so I haven't been able to do that to show them, and I know if I don't do cheerleading next you to be in the plays they'll be upset. And it just makes me so frustrated to even think about it because I want it so bad, and I really just want to chase my dreams. I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been telling them this since I was like seven, and nothing has came out of it. My best friend is also very into acting, but her mom actually understands - she's gone to auditions for schools and everything. And now I'm freaking out because next year is the year to look at colleges, and I know that they probably won't support me in going into a school for acting. To be completely honest, I don't even want to go to college. Well, I do, but it's just that I don't want it to slow me down. I would rather work my way into acting, and if for some reason it doesn't work I could go to business school, because that would be my second choice. But that means now would be the time for me to really start.        What made me post this, was because about 5 minutes ago a talent agency called and my mom picked up and I heard he say that she was my mom or whatever so I picked up the phone and listened, and it was a talent agency the I set up an account online with, and they said that they wanted to talk to me this weekend, and I heard my mom say, I'm sorry she wont be able to make it this weekend, and then I just hung up because I was so frustrated. And when she got off I asked her who it was, because she didn't know that I knew, and she was like "It was nothing for your concern sweetie." And now I'm just really mad, like for real mom, come on. I mean, I know I haven't brought it up to them in close to a year, but it's because I'm scared. And I shouldn't be because it's my dream, but I don't want them to take it away from me. And this makes my parents sound like awful people, but they're so loving - they just don't understand.   Like this summer, me and my friend want to do all these acting camps, and courses for on screen acting, but if I do cheerleading again - which I'll probably get sucked into, then I'll have cheerleading camp like all summer and I wont be able to do it.   And I'm at the point where I just really don't know what to do. I know this is what I want so bad, but I can't get myself to talk to my parents about it, because I'm scared of what they'll say.   I really hope someone can help me with how to talk to them, or what to do myself - because I don't even know anymore.

But she proceeded to give me more signs and I asked her to the movies twice and she said yes, but she was busy both times. Her friends are also a lot nicer to me now than what they were. But a few days ago she wouldn't reply to my texts and she said it was cause I told people that she likes me, although I didn't do anything. Then she talks to me the next day like nothing happened. Now she doesn't give me any signs but is asking people I talk to a lot why they think she likes me when they have no idea what is going on or she asks if they heard the rumor about us, which only 10 people have heard. None of which I talk to. So does she like me or not and why would she go around asking people those things about the rumor?

20090227151741AANIFe9	Family & Relationships;Family	How should i help my mum?	my mum has been having a stressful time at work, and I know that there has been quite a lot of tension between her and several work colleagues (and them between themselves), which has all occured since the new manager is a real ****. anyway, my brother is also getting married in the summer and she is helping organise some things, at first i thought it was just having lots of things to do that was stressing her out, but in reality me and my sister helped her and its all sorted. However recently she's been getting angry at little things and doesnt ever seem to be relaxed, she's always thinking about work or the arguments between colleagues. She's just been arguing with us (the rest of the family) about nothing really and its clear to all of us that she's just really stressed. its the weekend, so i was thinking maybe I could do something with her? have a bit of fun, so she could relax a little, any ideas please???
20090227151629AAxSLHl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i have the right be jealous ?	K so here's the deal, my boyfriend who I've been dating for almost 2 years, treats me like royalty. But he always seems to be hanging out with girls. Like He got asked to prom by this one girl, who constantly asks him to go on *dates* with him. He works at a restaurant and the hostess always bakes him desserts, and they often go out. Yesterday he almost came to watch my swimming competition with 2 girls? Then today he said he plans on being like Gene Simmons ? These are just some of the things that happened....I know he loves me, but he accuses me of being a very jealous person.

20090309161133AAitgdO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he a guy likes you, does he always call?	I make out with this guy at clubs when we see each other when I'm drunk - he's tried to take me to bed before & I didn't let him 'cus we don't know each other, I don't sleep around & I don't want STDs. But this one night, I was REALLY wasted & I wanted him to come back to my apt. I was like "honey, we both know you only talk to me because you want to sleep with me - & right now, I'm drunk enough where I really don't care - why don't you just come in?" - he looked offended about this & said that he did like me but he had to take care of his brother. He doesn't call me (but I don't call him either).      His girlfriend is visiting him now (she lives in another country) - he came up & talked to me in the club while she was around. I waved to be polite but didn't talk to him 'cus I don't need drama with some chick who's jealous because her boyfriend is an asshole who messes in front of her.       This guy is definitely not serious relationship material. But I was wondering if he does like me 'cus I'd REALLY like to make out with him more (no sex tho - I'm pretty sure he has a billion stds). How do I let him know this whole complicated thing?

20090309155847AA0Ec4l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS HELP ME ON THIS PLEASE!?	Ok so I can already assume ALL of you are going to think I'm a COMPLETE A$$HOLE on this one; so here it is...I cheated on my girlfriend a month ago.  I know I shouldn't have, I regret it so much.      But here's the thing, I've been talking to her recently and things are looking better.  Just yesterday though, I asked her if she ever saw herself forgiving me and maybe getting back with me and she said she was unsure but then proposed something...      She said that she’d like to make me her little slave by making me get on my knees and kiss her feet and smell them.   She even said that she’d like to walk barefoot and make me like the bottom of her feet (cleaning them with my tongue).      I was a bit thrown off by it but she said that would definitely fix everything since she kind of has a fetish for that sort of thing.      I’m wondering, should I do this? Would any of you girls like your guy or just any guy to do this to you? If so, what else should I expect her to make me do? or what would you make a guy like me do?

20090309153622AAjT6YT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Stay in my marriage for the kids?	Hello, I am a young married mother of soon to be 3. I have been with my husband for 3 yrs. We just got married a few month ago. I knew when i married him,   that i don't know if he was the man that was right for me. We are just 2 very different people. We really have nothing in common. Why do i stay? I guess for my children. I had a single mother growing up and my father wasn't in my life. I just want my kids to have a stable home. But in order to do that i'm feel like i'm living this pretend life. I am a stay at home mother. I have a 5 yr daughter & a two son. Also i'm 4 month pregnant with our 3rd child. Thanks to the failure of the birth conrtol shot. My husband is so hard to live with. He is very controlling over me. I lost all my friends due to him. He gets mad if i want just want to go out to eat with the 1 friend i do have. He is 4 yrs older than me. Looking back on our relationship now, I think he wanted a younger woman that he can control.  He doesn't hit me but when we do get into a disagreement, he will raise his fist and act like he is going to hit me. When i felt like i was ready to leave him. He told me he was going to kill himself, so i just stayed. I don't have a college degree since i have put my life on hold to raise my children. I just don't know if i can Support  them off a high school education. I AM CONFUSED AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO..

20090309153602AAV0e5y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've honestly wrecked everything?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309155926AAtOaHB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 13 and have a very bad relationship with my mom...(WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG!!!)?	OK... This is pretty long, but I will try to make it as simple as I can...      So, ever since my mom got married to my step-dad in November 2008, my mom and I have had (and still have) relationship problems. I don't like my step dad at all. My hatred for him is so unbelievable that you don't even want to see the thoughts that I want to happen to him. This is because he has caused my only 2 siblings, that I was very close to, to leave the house and now both my brother (or siblings) hate our step-dad AND OUR MOTHER. My mom chose to represent his side and not stand up for us. She has a greater love for this man. One day, my little brother's teacher called our mom and said that he was behaving very poorly in school and class. When my little brother got home that day (when he was living with us last year), my mom and step-dad beated him with their hands and a belt. I would hear my little brother scream and his body bang against the wall as hard as you can imagine. On that same day, my little brother was so mad that he decided to go live with our dad (whom lives near Fort Lauderdale, FL). Before all this occured, my parents got divorced and my father moved out on my 11th birthday (May 17). OK. Let's skip to this year... So, sometime last week, I was working on my homework on my mom's computer until I came across some photos. When I looked at them, I was so in shock that I couldn't believe it. They were pictures of nude, old people and my mom and step-dad were in them/it!!! I saw my mom sucking other guys dick(s), being eaten out by other men and women. I even saw here posing naked in our jacuzzi!!! My mom never was like that/this until she met my step-dad. I always looked up to her as a big influence in my life until I saw those pictures. Now I think of her in disgust and as a **** and whore and everything bad. I get so mad when I look at her face and when ever she touches me (kiss, hug, handshake, etc.). She gives out the worst punishments ever! My cell phone is my life and my biggest protection. Where I live... It's very unpredicatable. There are a lot of creepy, old(er) guys that watch girls walk home after school and I have a big fear of getting raped. She could at least take away my radio or computer or something. And now when I look at the future, I see that it is horrible. I want a good future. If I do the same thing that my little brother did, which was move out and move to my dad's house and live with them, then I will be able to start thinking positive and do every thing to have a brilliant future. But I feel as if I can't do that if I continue to live down here. My step-dad kicked my oldest brother, of 21 years, out when he was 19-20 years old. My brother is stuggling as of today and I feel so bad for him. He wants to go to college and get a good job, but he's so low of money. I am so pissed with both my mom and step-dad. I want to tell her, "EITHER I GO OR HE GOES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THE SH** HERE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD ANY MORE!!! IT'S NOT FAIR THAT LUKE AND MATTHEW DON'T HAVE TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND FACE THIS CR** EVERYDAY!!! I WANT OUT!!!". Did I mention that they both argue everyday, non-stop, over the stupidest things?! It's so rediculous that I can't even barely find the love in that relationship. Anyways, I went to school today and got some transaction papers for me to move to a school that is closer to my dad's house because after I finish FCAT this month, I'm going to try to make this mission successful. I want out and I am so for real. I'm done with what I'm going through today. My mom has countinously gotten worser. She doesn't cook, clean, lazy. Everything oppostite that a good mother is like. I don't know what to do. Should i just leave forever and not talk to her anymore or just deal with reality?

20090309160139AANgfam	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she really worth it or should i give up now?	After breaking up with my girlfriend I had pretty low expectations as for us being the friends we used to be. For details i have another resolved question up:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Anyway to cut a long story short shes ignoring me at this particular moment in time.       Earlier today i was having an IM conversation with her mum (another long story) and one of our collective friends. I was having a great conversation with these two and at this point i was feeling pretty good about my life as a whole.      However, Her mum went to put something in the oven for dinner and while she was gone my Ex came into the conversation via her mums IM address and began talking with our 'neutral' friend. While this was happening she completely ignored the fact i was even in the conversation.       This really hurt me as it feels like its not enough that shes ignoring me but she has to draw attention to that fact and try and take over MY conversation.      The main question here is, do you think its worth trying to be friends with her anymore? Even after her brutal attempt to hurt me i still have feelings for her.

20090309151557AATud6E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She rediscovered me and wants me back?	I liked this girl a lot and even to the point that I wouldn't stop bugging her. But we had our confrontation and she rejected me after admitting she liked me but not the way i like her. Things have changed since then and I'm dating another girl which I like every much but still shes in my life and she sent me a text the other night. I refused to talk to her because she ignored me and never spoke one word to me. I explained to her that I'm happy with the girl I'm with now and that I don't want to be associated with her at all. But just today she was in our library and she kept starring at me constantly. She then again later was walking to the bus zone and starred at me as she went by. I don't like her anymore but its almost like I feel a slight hesitation to feel sorry for her. So what do I do?

20090309151710AAlbrZ2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Could My Bestfriend Possibly  Like Me? We're both girls.?	Ok I have a question. I met my bestfriend back in the beginning of the school year. We were cool for a minute, but some time in early October we just kinda clicked and have been almost inseperable after that. Well, I Love this girl to death and i would do absoulutely anything for her and I know she feels the same....and ever since we started getting close in october, ive known her to be very "friendly" (touchy-feely) towards me. But recently, its kinda been different...She's always forcing her arm into mine (interlocking them), absently rubbing my arms when she talks to me (even when shes not looking at me or talking to me directly she does it), she'll go as far as holding my fingers when we walk, smiling when she sees me (FOR NO REASON!!), she sits really close to me at lunch, when she laughs shes always touching me  in some manner, When we hug, she hugs me either at my shoulders or around my waist/midsection, resting her head on me for at least 10 seconds... 4 to 5 seconds at the least.There are just ALOT of little things that she does that, you know, makes me question whats going on with her. I really dont care if she does like me like that, my view of her will never change. It would just be nice to know some outside opinions. I dont want to ask her and be wrong! Plus, in all honestly, I cant stop thinking/worrying about her! I dont think i like her or anything, but recently she has been on my mind alot. More-so than my boyfriend that i ABSOLUTELY adore, love and cherish.I just have all these weird feelings about her.....When she cries, I cry.   If im having a bad day and she smiles, i forget my problems and cant help but smile with her. If someone does something bad to her, i cant help but get upset...so yeah, what do you guys think? What's going on here?? Let me know because im completely baffled!      P.S. She came out to me as a lesbian back one morning in late November. (This was after some boy hurt her though) She walked me to class and interlocked arms with me.Then started talking about all the "gay and bi girls" that liked her at the time. Then that was that....Later that day at lunch, the story changed! She wasnt gay anymore! She changed her mind, I guess....but like 10 minutes earlier she had pushed me (BY MY BUTT) into the door of the cafeteria and when i asked her why she did it, she said because she wanted to.....

20090309152634AAQNZFx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I broke up with my boyfriend last night, but i realize i made a mistake now. Can i get him back ?	We've been dating for 2 and a half months, pretty seriously.   We've broken up twice, once for less than a day and another time for 4 days.   I broke up with him because i thought that he was going to do it again, and i wasn't going to be able to handle it if he broke up with me.   I thought this because i texted him 3 times and he didn't respond.   i found out that really he just had his phone taken away temporarily, and he was going to call me to tell me when he got home.   realizing that he wasn't going to break up with me, i really want to take back what i did.    All me friends are against the two of us being back together because they think that 3 times is enough.   #1) should i ask him back   #2) how do i get him to ask me back ?

20090309153634AAXy6rz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Caught boyfriend cyber cheating?	I recently found out my boyfriend of two and a half years who I live with has been sending messages to some girl he doesn't know, about how much he loves her and wants to see her naked.  I confronted him yesterday, and he said he wouldn't do it again.  And he sent her another message saying he loves her.  He apparently doesn't realize I know his passwords.        So I told him to leave and he took some stuff and left, but I can't stand it.  I really love him and want to give him another chance.  Has anyone had a good result from giving someone a second chance?

20090309154536AALUF1T	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can't understand my bf - need a man's perspective...?	I've been with my partner for 1 yr and 7 months. We love each other very much, I'm 26 and he's 34. When we first started going out, I wasn't as in to him as he was with me. He use to question how much i cared for him etc... Over time he won my heart and i haven't looked back since.      We share the same future goals..i.e marriage etc. He tells me that he wants to settle down and doesn't want to waste his time. His friends and family tell me this to. I feel that I'm ready to take it to the next level, but he is reluctant and tells me although he is happy he could be 'happier' in the relationship. He tells me I need to reach my 'full potential' before he can commit 100%  and feels that we are not at that stage yet. He use to complain that I wasn't caring enough, too independent and I act like a man etc. Yes, I am independent and I have learnt to let go of my pride and let him in more. I have compromised in areas I have weaknesses in. I just don't get what more I'm suppose to do to show him I am trying to be the woman he wants me to be.       Any advice?      Olivia

20090309155317AA8aZSx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just broke up with my girlfriend and have no one to talk to. Can someone help?	My relationship just ended after 4 years. I'm 24 and I might be depressed. If I am depressed..........I've been this way since 2003. I don't have any1 to talk to and I'm afraid I may become severely depressed and I may be capable of harming myself. I think this because I've had "thoughts". We broke up because I haven't been providing like a man should and I've noticed for the last 7-9 months she 's been hiding feelings and I can tell that I'm hurting her. And at the same time she wants to be with me and is constantly telling me that she's willing to stay by my side. I was the one who made the decision to separate. I can't watch her hurt because of my failure to make her happy and do things a couple should be doing at a young age. I feel like if we have a lil break maybe I can "find myself" and break this cylcle I've been in for the past 5+ years. I feel like I'm holding her back. Was this a good decision and does it make sense to do what I did? Have you ever been in a situation like this? What should I do?

20090309155508AAcnGgd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What does marriage really mean?	With so many marriages these days, it seems like the true meaning of marriage seems lost. My sister, for example, dated a man for five plus years, they married and were separated just a few months later! I have been in a relationship for a while now and my significant other and I have spoken often and with great fondness on our marriage but I want to understand what I'm getting myself into!   He was married once before and that marriage failed. I'm not looking for a starter husband, I want to spend the rest of my life with this man but I just don't understand - I know marriage means living together, forming a (hopefully) permanent partnership with another person but what does marriage really mean? What makes marriages work and turn from being a word and a nice idea to reality (besides marriage itself)?   And please, no dictionary definitions. I'm really confused on this one.

20090227152445AASRLkF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Simply a long term booty call or not patient enough?	So I have been having a sexual relationship with a coworker for over a year and a half now and I'm getting tired of how things are between us.   First off he is twice my age (I'm 25) and while we have a lot in common and get along great, he isn't interested in spending time with me outside of the job. Where do we have sex? Wherever we can have a quickie without being noticed (it was fun at first because it was a dangerous rush but the novelty has since wore off) and I have never been to his place.   He is separated from his wife (she lives in another state) We have been out on a "day-date" once.. To the movies. I have told him I'm upset with our situation and He claims he loves me and all that b.s and we will spend more time together soon but I'm sick of waiting around. So am I a booty call or should I be more patient?

Ive known he was married and knew that he was having issues in his relationship. (Not becuase of me at all. Ive spoken to her about why they are separated.) Over the course of the last 5 months, shes moved all of her things out of the house and back home. They have filed for divorce and no longer have contact with each other. (I know all of this for a fact. Ive seen her moving her things out and been in his place many times to see all her things gone.) Now I want to try to take things to the next level which would be me leaving my unsatisfying boyfriend and telling people about us. Ive mentioned it to him, and hes open to the idea and just wants to be happy, but we havent really decided on anything. Im having trouble brigning it up to him again because im a little nervous. How do I do it?       Please dont sit here and lecture me on how its wrong to be with a married man and what not. I know its wrong and I'll deal with my karma when it comes back to me. If your not going to focus on the issue at hand, dont respond. Thank you.

20090309162302AAorEiO	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i in the wrong, or are my parents?	I'm very frustrated and would greatly appreciate anybody who would take the time to read this and help me out.      Ok so my family went to the mall this weekend to buy new clothes because we received a tax refund. i asked my parents to buy me a single pair of pants that cost $98, an expensive amount i realize, but that was it; i didn't ask for anything else. They told me they wont spend that much on clothes so i left empty-handed. However, this was the second time this month my sister has gone to buy new clothes and spent $150 on about 4 outfits for the second time, probably totaling at over $300 this month alone. My mom also bought 3 shirts for $30 apiece and other clothes. The last time I got new clothes was 3 months ago when i threw in $150 for $220 worth of clothes and told my parents they no longer owed me the $200 that they took from me earlier that month.       Am i asking too much of my parents to buy me these types of clothes, or are they at fault for denying me less than a 1/3rd the money on clothes as they give my sister? I can see where they are coming from that it is much smarter to buy cheap clothes, but i see my sister in a new outfit LITERALLY every day, which cannot be cost efficient no matter how cheap! Are they right and I'm just a whinny kid? or should i at least be allowed the single pair of jeans i want?

20090309163641AA4R8dX	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend fell in love with me but I don't love her... :/ *sigh* (I'm a guy.)?	I met my current best friend 8 months ago, and we've been hanging out together all the time ever since. We would often sleep over at each other's house,hang out together and so on. She's like my soulmate.Everything was fine, until I found out she might be in love with me... A few days ago, I read an article she wrote on her blog where she wrote something like "I love him. I wish he told me he loves me too".   I stumbled upon her blog by chance. She used to tell me pretty much everything, but she's changed somehow. For instance, last Saturday, she, another friend of ours, and me were in town and she suddenly said something like "Could you please leave us alone a few moments? I would like to talk to her (our friend) in private"   I think they may have been talking about me back then :/   I don't want our relationship to fall apart for such a thing. I just want everything to be like before... I love her, but only as her best friend...    Is there anything I can do to prevent our relationship from falling apart?

20090309172614AAVi95Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about this. CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA?	pre-view   i'm in such a bad situation. so me and one of my guy friends live pretty far away as in a 3 hour plane ride. a couple months ago i started getting more and more feelings for him, more than a friend. we were talking one day and he pulled the "your like a sister to me" i was shocked and i still am. i know that means whatever i feel is just one sided and i need to forget about him like that, but its sooooooo hard he'd s really good friend and he's such a great guy that i don't wanna just forget about him. i'm going down there in a couple of weeks to visit a college i'm def going to be seeing him because he told me he'll come up from college to come see me, but i don't know if i can do it. its gonna be so hard. i'm a wreck and i don't know what to do about it? i don't know how to handle the situation? its makes it all the worse that he pulled the sister card on me a couple days ago and i can't avoid him because i'm going there. what should i do.....(btw he's also my cousins best friend, and me and my cousin are really close hes my brother)      now   so the trip down there could not have been anymore awkward. i was extremely quiet and barely talked to him. and he was like "why are you not talking, you're so boring now" little does he know how uncomfortable i was. we went out on Saturday my cousin, him, my sister, me, and his cousin. we were drinking and i got pretty faded. i basically clung to him all night and he didn't in anyway push me away. my sister said he was pretty much attached to me and was holding me and what not. the next day it was really awkward and we barely talked at all. i texted him before i left telling him thanks for taking care of me and he said it was no big deal he didn't want me to fall or anything.         my sister is convinced that he likes me, but he can't pursue anything because i'm his best friends sister, and the only reason he was holding me and clinging to me was cause i was faded and it would look like he was taking care of me, so my cousin (his best friend) wouldn't get mad.      does this make any sense? i'm not sure i totally believe my sister, then again i don't remember everything except that he walked with me all night.

20090309172926AAomfc4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I recently Went to Prom with the girl of my dreams?	But I don't know what do think about some subtle moves she made during the Prom. We have gone on 3 previous dates, and she told me that she is not ready for a relationship right now and that she is still going to be dating other guys. She has told me she likes me twice and I really like her. Right after we (me and my group) finished dinner, she and two other girls in the group went to "wash their hands." Idk why girls do that!! But anyways, at the dance, she asked me to go to the bathroom twice, and by now I'm stressing thinking I'm the problem, and that I've been boring so I decided to be a little more flirty. She asked me, " what are you thinking right now?" I said, "If I told you I would have to kill you." She then said, "I will take my chances." I kept avoiding it on purpose to see how she would act and she would do a sad puppy dog face but I kept making her laugh. She would hit me then rested her head on my chest a couple of times. I then told her that I was glad hat I was at the Prom but even more glad that I was with her. She thought that was sweet. Later, on the car ride home, she told me that I'm one of the most respectful guys she has ever met. The night didn't end with a kiss, but I was really happy just to spend time with her and hold her hand. My questions are:    1. Is her going to the bathroom so many times a bad sign?   2. Does her laying on my chest symbolize she is getting more comfortable with me, or is that just a normal thing all girls do??   3. What do you think by her meaning I'm "respectful" meant?? Cuz it can mean many different things.      *These may seem like stupid questions, and I'm sorry, I've just been stressing. THANK YOPU TO EVERYONE WHO HELPS!!!

20090309170409AA6UEqa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am in love with this guy and I can't stop myself.?	There is this guy named Jason in my Spanish class and I met him during the summer before Freshman year started. We kind of have a love/hate relationship. He teases me all the time and everybody thinks we hate eachother. Except, we're actually good friends we just put on a show for the laughs.       I've liked him since I met him, but he has a girlfriend. He's nice, rich, tall, popular, smart, good looking etc...... and seriously he seems like THE PERFECT GUY. (like no joke ......)   I CANT STOP LIKING HIM. like in Spanish class if he starts joking around with a girl sitting next to him my mood goes from "wheee happpy!!!" to "i feel like jumping off a cliff"      After class we walked together and to get to the stairs at our school you have to open this hugeee door that has like windows all around it. We were joking about how short I was and we were like standing together looking at our reflection in the window and it just felt really home-y and I just felt like crying.   I like him so much.    What do I do??
20090309171140AAgPF0w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Answerrr!  HELP!?	Okay I have been scared to death for the past few weeks. I am 19 and I do not want to take a pregnancy test because I am deadly afraid of the outcome. I have sex three times this month with my boyfriend. I had sex twice two days after my period, (because it was valentines day) and we use condom for the first time and I think that exclude the chance of me being pregnant. That night we had sex but it didnt last over a minute. Next I have sex with him just last week and once again I think it didnt last a minute because I was kinda asleep. He wasnt horny at that time I just went on top of him because I was horny I guess but I dont know why or how I get horny when I was half asleep but eventually I woke up and get away. My period came on the 5th of last month so now it is late. I have been crying for the past week and it has just been so miserable for me. I had a little headache, no cramp but I feel like my body feels weird. I cant be pregnant because I need to finish school. I am freaking out but my boyfriend said I am over reacting, he said that he didnt ejaculate and my mind is just messing with him. As much as I want to believe what he say I am still really worry. I kind of figure that fact it is impossible for me to be pregnant because thinking about it he didnt ejaculate in me, but then my mind turns upside down and think 'oh crap maybe there is a chance I am'!   Thinking about this drives me crazy and I dont have anyone but my boyfriend to take about because I am kind of embarrass so can you please tell me what you think? I know I need to get a pregnancy test but thats not my question, my question is am i pregnant? What are the chances?   Thank you!   P.S. I am 90% sure it was under a minute, we moved in an out for about six times and the other time he just sticked it in and let it stay there.

Like this guy in one of my classes, if I have my stuff on the table. Anything, like pen, notebook, paper, he will touch it. He will pick up and fondle my stuff. If he would have asked I would've been like sure check it out but no he just grabbed it.      Am I the only person who doesn't like people to touch their stuff?

20090309164741AAl9p5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to ask a crush...to go...to be???....WHAT?	lol, forgive me for the title. I wanted to feel special... Lol?      Anyways...   Lets not beat around the bush.      If you and a girl cast each other glances once in awhile, and you are sure enough that she likes you back and its not all in your head, what exactly do you do to get past the glances? All I see is really bad jokes and awkward silences in my future, so I could use some insight.      And you go on dates first, (if you don't know them as a close enough friend) BEFORE asking them to be your girlfriend right? How does that work? "LETS GO TO THE REALLY DIM THEATRE SO WE CAN WATCH THE MOVIE AND BARELY SAY 3 WORDS TO EACH OTHER?" and what to talk about? ......as you can see....please help.   -_-      Thanks to you all.
20090309171152AAYPOaz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..       I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now,  I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

I got this email:      Dear Tara,              Hi I'm so very sorry for the way that I have been acting to you like having an attitude I don't mean to hurt you but I think I'm getting moody and moodier by the minute. So sorry again! Being a girl is very hard I mean we are all so moody!! LOL I'm probably going through a stage of being mean sorry I really don't mean to be hurting your feelings! So if I'm doing anything mean just tell me okay....                            From,                              McKenna          so i sent this:       Hi Mckenna! How are you? Is anything new? hey,  Mckenna? I just wanted to know if we were still friends. I will SOOOOO not blame you if you say no. Its just that i don't want to be bugging you.  Don't get me wrong here... I just don't want to be like Makayla. I'll talk to you later Bye      Then i got this:      I'm sorry Tara but I think it's best if we are not friends and it not just because of the other night it that we all haven't been getting along. I'm sorry.                          Bye      The other night i was at a party and i started crying because she was talking smack and i wouldn't tell her why i was crying.      then i sent this:      oh. I understand.       Then i thought that that was too simple to match what i feel so i sent this also:      Hi Mckenna. I am so sorry this whole thing turned out so wrong. I feel like such a mean, horrible person. i wish that i could go back in time to make things right. But i cant and i just want you to know that even though all this happened i still think that you are very sweet and i love you like a sister.  nothing you could ever do that would change that. I might have sounded bossy or rude lately. maybe i thought something that wasn't true or asumed somthing. Oh boy, don't girl hormones suck right now??? I really don't know why i acted so mean and i feel like one of those people that you see in movies. You know, the ones who act all snobby and mean. I hope you know that i wasn't talking behind your or Bri's backs today. Shelby asked me if you guys were the ones who made me cry and I said, "NO NO NO! you have it all wrong. they wouldn't do that!!" and she said ok. i will stop emailing and talking to you if you tell me what i did wrong. I swear. i feel like i just got punched in the stomach. I am crying soo hard right now. Even hayley, kayla, and bri don't want to be my friend. (sob) i just wanted you to know i take everything back and i am sorry. Love you, Bye      What should i do? please i need emotional support. (sob)

You were not calling the cops on your kids if they were not at the supper table by 6.,, you just stepped outside and hollered for them to come home.   You refered to your elders as Mr. and Mrs.,  ppl said yes mam, no sir, etc.   Most of all, I miss the fact that at one time.   A MAN'S WORD AND HANDSHAKE were all you needed to seal a deal!   My brothers still say, "If I look you in the eye, shake your hand, you can bet you'll hear the truth!".

20090309100949AAh3XD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I text him or wait for him?	This guy & I are getting more serious, as though I thought anyway. Recently we were talking about a future relationship, we both said we want one with each other, but he told me he can't have one right now with me, because of the distance he said. (i live in st. louis, he lives in chicago) He said he isn't ready for anyone to move in with him just yet, which wasn't my intention, I just told him I could make it easier and move there in the future if anything. So since we had that talk, we've been the same, he says he likes me ALOT and loves me, but he needs to work on some things which he said his job will be picking up in the summer. Anyway, we usually text each other equally, but this past weekend I haven't heard from him which is sorta unusual. I last texted him (first) on thursday. And I wanted to wait and see if he took the initiative to text or contact me first. But hasn't yet. So should I still wait for him or text him today? I don't like games but I have no choice, I'm kinda disappointed in him.

20090309165949AAG8aFy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy do that?	For guys:      U are starting to get to know this girl, and if you are not interested in her whatsoever, would u ever ask her to hang out with u one on one every time?       I've just watched the "He's Just Not That Into You" movie, so I know if a person is not interested in a girl, they won't bother calling you.  It's actually pretty common sense.      The thing I don't get is, why would a guy be around you so much to a point where you think they like you, but they just disappear a week after that, then stop contacting all together?  That guy basically being hot one day, then cold the next day.  Then out of no where, maybe a month later, they talk to you as if nothing is wrong.  But the end result is still ignorance.      This is when I don't know how to draw the line. Are we even friends, because friends are suppose to talk to one another instead of avoiding you.       Thanks

20090309174719AAgMYE0	Family & Relationships;Family	What's you opinion on my situation? (Sorry,Long post)?	I am 23 years old and until few years ago I did not know I even had a half-sister from my father's side. My father died few years ago and recently a relative of mine told me that my sister wants to establish friendly relations with me and would it be ok if she'd send me a letter. I said sure, but its been 3 months and I don't have a letter. I remember ten years ago being shown a photo of a little girl (I was now told that this photo was of my sisters), but back then no one told me that this was my sister. For some reason that photo stuck in my mind for years. I mean, I forgot about it, but once it got mentioned I immediately remembered it.      This is what I know about my sister. She's 17 years old and is probably dependent on her mother. For some reason I feel like her mom does not want us to establish family ties.   Recently I even heard a town, where she lives, but that person(a relative of mine) who told me that did not tell me her address.      Who do you think most likely caused the fact that I still don't have her letter?      I am leaning towards thinking it's my half-sister's mother. My half-sis is 17, so maybe her mom refused to let her reconnect with me. My relative does not seem to want to even mention my sister anymore. My biological father left my family and then hers. He later regretted it. Could her mother still be mad at my dad? I am not my father, I am just a half-brother who wants to establish relations with his sister. The best I can hope for now is that my half-sister will soon grow up and put some effort into reconnecting with me, without being influenced by her mother. I heard she's eager to establish family ties, but after initial conversation, this relative is quiet about it (maybe that person was told to keep quiet by someone).      I know I probably should not blame my half-sister's mother, but I don't see any other reason why I would not get this letter and why my relative is suddenly quiet about it.      Thank you in advance if you could answer!

20090507075154AAL83jN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls! how should i proceed?	I've gotten to like this girl in a lot of my classes & labs, we've started talking a lot and started spending our mornings together (breakfast and hanging between classes). When I asked her to go flying with me over the weekend she agreed sounding really excited, but I had to cancel because of the weather.      we went on a really long walk in the rain after our lab last night and she kind of opened up and i learned that she had a boyfriend that dumped her a couple months ago the same day that she lost her dad. she kept telling me how shes over him and has moved on even though hes tried to get back with her last week.      How should i proceed in this situation?
20090309103923AAbcIig	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do for my boyfriend?	Well, i'm ill at the minute, and my boyfriend has been an angel. He has taken me to the doctors, then when we found out the trouble i was having, he understood that it wasnt a comfortable illness for me, so he let me have some space, and sort myself out.       I'm still ill, and my boyfriend said he really wants to help me so i allowed him to. He's just amazing. He brings down the duvets when i feel tired, and lets me fall asleep in his arms. He cooks me meals when i dont have enough energy too.   How can i repay him? Any ideas?
20090309100757AAwrX0S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Update on Should I tel my boyfriend I'm Pregger?	Well I took some advice that I got here. So I went to the alley where he spends most of his time and found him buying drugs, I was going to turn around then but i remembered my unborn baby, So i went up to him and he just stared he said your pregnant I was like 8 months. he asked me Is it mine, I said yeah. he then ask what you want me to do it's to late for an abortion. Then I fussed at him I just said I want you to be part of our son's life and I want you to get clean. He just walked away then. a few days later my mom saw him and he told her that he is going to get clean now he is in rehab and I'm so proud of him now we can be a family once he gets out
20090309164436AAQtbHi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(Girls)Is it normal to always want to be with your boyfriend? Long distance trust?	I always feel the need to be with my boyfriend. we don't spend enought time together on the weekend and when we're in school together we don't get that much time together either. I hate being seperated from him. I often feel like i'm being too clingy...but i can't help it.      Question 2:   Soon my boyfriend will be going off to college. I want him to stay in an in state college, but he's had thoughts of going out of state. Just recently i found out he's not though. The reason why i want him to stay in state is because:       1) i want to be close to him and so he can visit me on weekends besides just sending me emails or talking on the phone.   2) We've planned our future right here together. it just seems like our plans will be ruined if he goes of to out of state. but it could be all the better for his education and he's doing it for the both of us.   3) the thought of him going out of state makes me think that when he does, we won't be able to reunite after a long 4 year wait of not being together.       I've heard of distance makes the relationship stronger...and my boyfriend always says that two people make a relationship work, not one. And he also says that you can't hope to fly with just one wing. It takes two. I feel like i'm being selfish for not wanting to leave, but i want my boyfriend to suceed in life and return to me happy.       I guess what i'm asking is, how do i get over from feeling so lonely when he's away, and how do i deal with always wanting to be with him?   Please help. thanks.
20090309172757AAKlycX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hmmmm.........................…	Hmmmm.........................…   .... WTF why is it that I always end up the friend and never anything more?It's always the guys who are assholes and I may be outgoing but im not like that. I mean I have lots of friends that are girls and like i'll be nice and help them out,not being too available but it never ends up being anything more...yess i flirt with girls, not alot though but again im always the damn person who's asked for advice about their relationships and honestly it's kind of depressing...and the fact that people sayy oh she'll come along or it'll happen someday is really annoying because i've been wating a real long time and it hasn't happened yet..am i just destined to be alone? according to girls im supposedly cute but i'm seriously starting to doubt it..
20090309173206AAm0P57	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't seem to find a relationship?	I have had guys like me before, but i never seem to like them. I have liked boys before but it never went anywhere. (they usually ended up being stupid and i didnt want to waste my time with them.)       It always worries me that i dont like the boys that like me. It makes me afriad that i will never like anyone who likes me back. I think i might be afraid to be in a relationship but i dont know that for sure. I have never been in a relationship and i would like to but everytime someone is intrested in me i find something wrong with them and turn them down.
20090309175657AA8aCfQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is bi, am I reacting the wrong way?	I just found out today that my best guy friend is bisexual and that he has a boyfriend who I am also friends with. I love my friends to death and if they're happy being bisexual then that's fine with me. My best friend has been teased since elementary school that he was gay and he ignored it. I wasn't one of the people who constantly made fun of him about his " gayness ". He told me today that he came out of the closet 3 months ago. There's a bisexual fad that's going on and the problem is that I don't want my friend to be bi because of a fad. So what I'm wondering is if he's really bi or if he's just taking part of a fad and because everyone else is doing it. I care about him allot and I don't want him to get hurt.I don't want him to just be bi because everyone else is bi. If he was doing that, it would be sad because I wouldn't want his boyfriend to be hurt or him.      His boyfriend said that he's been bisexual since he was in 6th grade but just didn't tell anyone because he didn't want to receive a backlash. I doubt that he's taking part of the fad since he's been bi for like 4 years.

20090309172912AArlkRu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need Help Please! Middle school drama?	ok well I have a best friend and sorta got mad at her. I am afraid we might not be friends anymore and I can't afford to lose her. She is always there for me and I treat her like crap. She is a lot more open hearted then me and I really don't wanna lose the most important person in my life. We have been best Friends for two years now and we really try to look more towards the things we have in common then our differences. I have 4 other friends and two of the always treat me and Frankie (best friend) like we are a piece of crap. So today I got mad at something I shouldn't have and I think I might've lost my best friend. I sat in my normal seat for my class and she got mad at me because she wanted to sit there today. Carly(one of the girls that torture me) said to move to the other seat and to let Frankie sit there because I always sit there. Well that ticked me off so I moved to a different table and called Frankie crabby. Then Frankie thought that Annie( one of my other friends whom frankie doesn't get along with) told me something that made me mad at Frankie. Then a little bit ago Annie called me and told me Frankie flipped out at her online and blocked her. Then later after I had dance I called frankie and told her nothing had to do with Annie and that I hate being the Guinea pig in the group. I am so confused. Someone PLEASE help me.

20090309103514AA68o1t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this guy?	Ah, I'm so confused. :(      So I went to a concert and the opening band was really good. We met eachother there, but VERY briefly...   We added eachother on facebook and he sent me a message and said that he didnt want to ask me at the time, but wanted to go out with me and thought i was really pretty...   We've talked a bit online and texting...   Then his band had a little concert a few days ago and invited me, so I went along with a friend.   When I came he basically ignored me at first, but later came and gave me a hug & said hey and happy that I came...   Later he was outside with his band, and my friend and I went out to get some air but didnt go up to them and I saw him like looking at me....   During his performance we kept making eye contact, and he smiled at me.   Then at the end he said bye....      We like didn't talk at all... he seemed really anti social and maybe even shy.....      but then the next day he chatted me....      urhghhh      I just thought that maybe he'd be more talkative and happy to see me....      anyone know maybe what's going on????      He's always been the one to start the conversations...   Should I do it this time?  maybe or no or yes??...            thanks :)
20090309102111AARqW0C	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when a friend is jealous of you?	Recently I moved to a new city and met a new gal friend at school. She's a nice person, but recently I get the feeling that she is jealous because she makes all sorts of passive aggressive comments directed towards me. For instance my parents still help me out financially (which I appreciate) but she'll make comments to the effect that I'm some spoiled little daddy's girl that doesn't have to work for anything. Also I'm getting married soon, and she called me "vanilla" and "boring" because I told her I don't think group sex is normal. She's a smart person and she's helped me out in the past. She has a lot going for her, but I'm not sure if I can really be friends with someone when I can't shake off the feeling that they have ungrounded sinister feelings towards me. Should I tell her how I feel or should I just distance myself from her and just move on? The only reason I'm torn is because I don't know that many people yet and I don't want to burn any bridges...
20090309094030AAi1mxN	Family & Relationships;Family	Family issues, HELP!?	Ever live with someone you were uncomfortable with, how do/did you deal with it?..?   I'm asking because my as much as I love my dad (step-dad), he's the only "father" figure I've known since I was young, Im happy that he retired and reclocated, because our family was miserable being together.      My family consist of my mom, my twin, rabbit, and him.      Now, he retired and left as he's 15 years older than my mom, hates the US and has family down in central america. He loves it there, he's only here to file taxes and fix a couple of things regarding financies and then he's leaving, but it could be like 2 months.      I love him, but I know its better than we're not together, my mom can remarry, and I don't have to come home to him being miserable and always being negative and in my business, which really pisses me off, as I have other things I'm dealing with right now.      How do I handle him for the time that he is at home?...   I go to college and work, I have a place im moving into in the fall.    But for the mean time, I thought I'd just find ways to keep busy, be nice to him, but not over do it, *** I can sense tension in my house with him being around**, he's a great guy, but its better for us to not live with him, he just causes us misery with his attitude.      What advice do you have for me?      Ever experience anything similar?, Do tell..thanks.

20090309180051AAhLxyc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What rights do I have as an expecting Dad when my current wife is being stubborn and divorce prone?	Suppossedly she has had a miscarriage, however I don't believe that.  She insists upon no visitation as she hated it when she was a teenager and her Dad left her Mom.  However, don't I have rights to know if she did indeed have a miscarriage?  If she didn't have a miscarriage don't I have rights that way also?      She insists upon no contact because everything I did was always wrong.  She wouldn't ever let me lead anything, no discussions, no part of our marriage.  She always had to have control, the last say, the final verdict, etc.  I don't blame her, lessons learned from childhood are always the hardest to break.  However, don't I have rights to know anything?  She refuses to answer my call, she refuses to let me email her, etc.

20090309165613AA9pPT7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help with this relationship issue.?	I've been in love with my best friends girlfriend since long before they were going out. Now that they are going out I can't stand it. I never asked her out because me and her became very close friends and I didn't know how she felt about me. My emotions were all confused during that time. I love this girl and can't stand hearing about her and my best friend. She then told me one day (when they were going out) that she really likes me and always did, but gave up when I decided to go out with someone else. I can't stand it, I'm depressed and don't know what to do. It's bad, but I would never ever want to hurt my best friend. She is still okay with kissing him and stuff even though she told me that she loved me and that she would have gone out with me if I would have asked and would rather be going out with me. We can't hurt my friend, I know I just can't. Now I don't know what to do, should I just forget about it and find someone else? I love her and can't stand it, stress is getting to me and I will just sit in school and not think of anything else. I'm going to be graduating high school soon. Please Help! I know this is a complicated situation, but what should I do. Again, I couldn't stand hurting my best friend.

20090309173120AAVib3k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get over this frustration?	My fiance broke off our engagement recently. He's been acting very irrational and immature since. He asked me to move out of our home via text message and this was all over something very petty. Anyway, long story short, the most frustrating thing is that when he gets angry, he completely shuts down. He won't answer phone calls, he won't respond to emails or text messages. I just have so much I want to get off my chest and I know its only making it worse when I keep trying to get through to him through texts and emails.Its just so hard because I really want to be able to talk before I move everything out but he just refuses and once its done, theres no going back. Has anyone dealt with anything similar? How do I just accept I may never speak to him again?

20090309093947AAZzkg6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Think this guy might of liked me but something has quickly changed his mind :S Please Help?	I started a new school and on my first day i met a guy and thats all fine and normal. I had my eye on him right from the start and i think he noticed me to, just the way he was around me and that. My whole first week he always said hey when he saw me round school and he was looking at me in lessons and we talked a bit on facebook and that.      Then one day I told one of his girl friends who I'm also friends with that I liked him. she seemed like she wanted to get us together a bit and as soon as i told her (because he was in the same room) she called him over to talk to him privatly. i don't know what she said and i'm sure her intentions were good but since then he hasn't been as talkative around me, i don't know if she told him and scared him off but what should i do?
20090309063029AAVEAc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she doing this to spite me?	My roommate is very inconsiderate. Early in the semester her boyfriend would be over 24/7 and they were always under the covers together which made me uncomfortable. When I'd ask her if I could "borrow" the room with my boyfriend or friend's she'd make nasty comments and not allow me to use the room or say she was tired      Finally I spoke to her about her boyfriend & her being under the covers and how it made me feel and she "somewhat" stopped doing it.After that they were still constantly over all day they didn't even go to the dining hall to eat.      Finally I sat with her again and talked and tried to see if we could agree on something regarding her boyfriend always being here I.E. (monday, wed.) she can have the room (Tues Thurs) I could have the room to study. Well, she "didn't like that idea."and he continued to come over.      After spring break though....I didn't see much of her or her boyfriend during the day. (He lives down the hall) The only time she came back was when my boyfriend came to my room for the FIRST TIME this year I wrote on the door "Banana" and had a hair tie on the door (figuring it would give her a hint) and she didn't get the hint cause she walked in on us.      She moved her furniture so it's closer to my bed and her light is literally right next to my bed and she now blares her music at 11PM as I'm trying to sleep. She also now every morning at 5PM turns on her light and gets ready for class and I'm unable to fall back asleep. She leaves her light on for 2 hours while she gets ready.      Could she be doing this just to irritate me?   or to spite me?   we haven't said much of anything to each other since after break.

20090309180009AAsJT9L	Family & Relationships;Family	I need to pick a last name and it's harder than I thought?	I might bore some people but I would like serious answers.I am the youngest of 6.Only me and my brother J have the same father  (yes my family is a class act). I've been living with my oldest brother R and his wife for almost 5 years.They have raised me and I don't want to leave their home.For years they have had custody of me and recently they offered to adopt me to make sure I never leave.This is what I want.At first I thought I would change my last name for my brother R's last name.I grew up with my nephews and my niece,I sort of think of them as my younger siblings and I want to share their name.Plus,I hate my father's *** and I don't want to pass on his name along with his crappy genes.I told my brother J about this and he didn't like it.We have the same last name and now he feels offended by my idea of changing it. J and I see each other every other weekend.I like him and I think we have a good relationship considering we don't see each other everyday.I know that if I keep my name the way it is R won't be offended.Now I don't know which one to pick.What would you do?

One of the girls said to me the other day that im cute and that she liked me but I don't really like me. So, the other 2 really hot girls, I already know one of them and am friendly with her. Seriously, she is so cute. So, she came and sat next to me today, the other girl was sat the other side of the room. So this hot girl goes to me 'oh dan your so cute' and we were having a really good time together and chatting and having a laugh. So, I like this girl but im not sure about if im good enough for her. I get a quite a bit of interest from the girls, i mean im not stunning but i dont think im bad looking either. The other day, the girl who said she liked me said to me that this hot girl gave her the evils as she was talking to me, and said that she thought this hot girl liked me but im not too sure. This hot girl always hugs me when I walk in to lesson and we get on so well.      What does it mean when she called me cute? Do you think she is just messing with me?

20090309165722AAJ01qJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUY PROBLEM!!! Please give me some advice! Thanks!?	So I got into a huge fight with a guy that I have been dating and we haven't spoken for over a month. And recently I was sitting with my friends in the college lounge and he comes over to us and asks one of my friends a question. We did not talk. But my friends told me that he was looking at me from time to time.      Then this week, he comes to me again and he asks if i still have his papers and I said I did and he said if he could have them back! (By the way the papers are for Calculus, and he already finished with that course)   Then he left and I went after him saying I am sorry for what happened and he told me he would like to be nothing more than friends. He said he was very busy with school work and such. He also said that we either could be friends or if we still were not talking then he would be fine with that. During this time I was VERY nervous!!!! I didnt know what to say and probably babbled on and on.          If he wants to be friends or if he says he doesnt mind NOT being my friend, then why is he making an effort to show up randomly in my face like that, TWICE??? I really need an explanation      Thank you so much   Jill

20090309091701AAyCCJl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you believe him that he didn't cheat?	I was engaged to a man who I dated for 2 1/2 years. During that time, he actually broke up with me, and married his ex girlfriend. Then he said that he made a mistake and it was me he wanted and loved. Yes, I was stupid, I was in love. Well, we continued to date and he asked me to marry him. The thing is, he would get mad at me a lot and break up with me. Like about every month. We are both in our 30's with children, so we are not young. He not only asked me to marry him but did so on Christmas day in front of all our children. He broke up with me February first and since then I have been told that not only was he having sex with a woman since the breakup, but that he was having sex with her through our whole relationship. When I confronted him on it, he got mad and called me a crazy psycho B... He said he didn't care if I believed him or not. Let me add in there, that until I had confronted him on this, he was going back and forth on wanting to get back together, and even made love to me. So? What do you think?

20090309104005AAjf82y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! What should I do!?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now. When we first stared going out he stopped doing pot because I didn't like druggies, also he was on probation. I'm a pretty optomistic girl, I veiw the world as if someone has a problem I should help them and people can change. Christmas break came and he was off probation [he was on probation for possesion of pot] he told me he wanted to start smoking. I went to his house and begged him not to. Without me knowing he did anyway, he has been doing it for two months without me knowing. I thought he was acting weird because of his back pain killers or because he got a new inhaler. But it was the drugs. I found out a week ago and I told him it was me or the drugs, I told him i could offer him a better life and a future, the drugs could offer him permafryed and a stress relever. He choose me but I'm having a hard time trusting him, I want to, but everyone I talk to says that he will hurt me again [they don't know him since they go to different schools] I just don't want to be hurt again, he told me he learned from his mistake.

20090309110927AACOtEU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Athletic, good looking woman.  Will she find me attractive?	I was introduced to a girl about a week ago.  We've never met in person, but we've seen a picture of each other.  She is very attractive and athletic.  I'm average looking (not bad looking), but I'm a bit overweight.  We have set a date for next week, and I'm nervous she won't find me attractive!  We connect and get along great on the phone, just hoping that it won't change when she sees me.  Any one able to tell me about their experiences in this case?

20090309173318AAcM0RC	Family & Relationships;Family	To tell my son the truth or not?	I've been struggling with a situation for some time now and thought I'd get the opinions of some others.      My eldest son doesn't know who his biological father is. Right now he's only 5 so he probably wouldn't understand what I was saying if I did tell him but I'm not sure if I ever should or not. My husband was there when I found out i was pregnant, when I gave birth,and has help support and raise him from the beginning. We were married just last year.   Before I ever knew I was pregnant or met my husband I was living with another man. Two weeks after the estimated conception date he committed suicide.    So my son only know my husband as his father. Heart, soul, and mind, my husband is his father. I was adopted at 13 and I know who my biological parents are and I wish I didn't. Perhaps this is partly what is making this so hard.       Do I need to tell him about his biological father at some point in his life, obviously when he's old enough to understand, or do I let him live, have children, and die believing my husband is his only father? My husband is puerto rican also, we have another son who we had together and you can see the difference in the boys. myself and his real father are both irish. so my eldest is red hair, fair skin and all, while my youngest is dark hair like daddy, fair skin like me. Should I let him think he's part Puerto Rican when he's not.    Part of me thinks it's right to tell him about this one day, but another part of me doesn't want to hurt him with the truth.       It seems so easy to just forget it and let him be as he is, but is it right? Like I said, I was adopted when I was 13, I know who my biological parents are but also remember my life with them before I was taken when I was 3. I wish I had never seen them after being adopted but I did. Because I would rather not know, I wonder if my son would feel the same way.      Any helpful thoughts? Thanks.

20090309164759AA84pxg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls ONLY! Kicked his balls before?  What happened?  Confused!?	This weekend I kicked this dude in the balls (I think?) cuz he was harassing me at a party, but nothing happened!  He just like backed up and was like "woah, baby!" I talked to a couple of my friends and some of them had similar experiences like half the time!  I always thought they would just go down right away?  So, wondering if any of you girls who have kicked guys in the balls:   1) Have any special way to do it?   2) How much experience do you have with this?   3) What happened each time?   4) How many times did it "work" or not "work".   Thanks for your input! :)
20090309170202AAJYJQC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Advice; I am so confused.?	There is this guy in my French class that sits right next to me. I like him a lot and we talk everyday (during French). He looks at me a lot and always says stuff to try to make him self be more impressive, Like when I am texting my friend Nick (from middle school, we're one year apart) he goes my friend knows Nick and says he really weak, when he comes next year I'm gonna beat him up and during Freshman hell week torture him. (in a joking way.. i think). He does get really flirty at times.However when ever Samatha is near him he completely ignores me and just get all flirty with her. In English he sits on the otherside of the room and he just stares at me but he never talks to me or pays attention to me other than that and he again starts flirting with other girls.I don't know if he likes me... Or if I should just like someone else.

20090309172429AA0PA6E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does BBW mean? I've been told one thing, but there is no way it can be true.?	I hear that BBW means "Big Beautiful Woman" and is applied to heavy set women, but that just cant be true. Heavy set women (I'm just going to call them fatties from here on in) are not very beautiful. An ocean going whale is a wonderful sight, but these land whales send people running for the harpoons. I find it impossible to imagine some one thinking some 400 pound (about 181.436 kilograms) fatty (fatty is an understatement) is a a sexy and or beautiful thing. What worse is those hideous blubber mounds have the stomach (lol) to call themselves "beautiful". no matter how nice your face looks, you still have trouble breathing while walking. So can some one tell me what BBW really stands for?

Until the end of the night when all my drunk friends decided I needed to be stripped naked becuase it was one of my last nights as a bachelor. So all my drunk idiot friends gang up on me and end up stripping me naked and tapping my hands to the railing beside my friends front steps right there on his front lawn. They used so much duct tape that I couldnt move my hands, then they went inside and left me there butt naked with my hands all tied up. I had to stand there bare naked all night and I couldnt yell for my friends or I would wake up the neighbours. The next morning before I was spotted by anyone my friends wife and sister pulled up in the drive way. They burst out laughing the moment they saw me and then the sister said "well ill go get the scissors before our neighboors see you" and then my friends wife walked up infront of me and pulled out a digital camera from her purse and snapped a shot of me and then said "wow Jason I thought you would have tried to cover up your little package" and then she started laughing again. Eventually I was cut free and got my clothes back, but that picture still remains at large. Overall though it was still a fun stag night.

20090309175411AAd2Vxt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think my husband is cheating on me?	I have been married now for almost a year.  My husband travels a lot on business and works really hard. He often goes to Washington DC (about 8 hours from where we live).  I recently discovered that he went to a strip club (not a huge deal to me) while he was in DC.  I wasn't too concerned about it until he started treating me really crappy- he would often "roll his eyes" at me or just seem generally irritated every time I talked to him.  He says he is just stressed with work and it has nothing to do with me, but that he just needs "some space" when he is home.  Last week I went through his computer history (he recently changed his password- which I found strange too) and saw that he was on just about every website (google, facebook, myspace, people search, 411.com) trying to find the name of this stripper that he met at the strip club. (apparently she gave him her "real name" not just her "stripper name")  I confronted him about it and he promises he was only trying to find out who she was and if there were any naked pics of her online.  This entire situation completely blows my mind.  I cant see him as the "type" to be unfaithful but he is really testing the limits.... I also was upset that he was trying to find naked pics of her, but mainly I am just paranoid that he is just trying to "connect" with her before his next visit out to D.C.   What should I do?  I don't trust him at all now and I never felt like this before.  I just don't know what to think.... He is married and should not be acting this way.  I talked to him about it multiple times but he made me feel bad for going through his "personal things" and said if he wanted to be with other women, he wouldn't have married me.   I just dont know what to think or do.... what should I do???

20090309175742AA6lyMn	Family & Relationships;Family	Resentful and hurt over what my dad said about hubby?	ok heres the deal. I recently went home to my parents house after a bad fight with my husband. He has anger management problems and can be very difficult at times.He's impossible to communicate with and can verbally abusive. I try not to go home when all possible, but sometimes its unbearable and i have to. Now, my parents know all of our business and my dad starting talking bad about my husband which i now resent. he said he was greedy, selfish and that he's using me. I feel so bad now and resent my dad for these things he said. My mom and him had a horrible marriage when i was growing up.They cheated on eachother and ect. I feel like i have nobody to turn to. Should i resent my dad for what he said or is that natural for him to want the best for me? he even questioned me when i was leaving to come back home. I'm so upset,any advice welcome. Thank you

20090309180740AAMaj5Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I break up with this guy?	Alright, me and this guy have been going out for a little while now. Are relationship has been up and down but i really do care for him. However i know i cannot be with him because he is bad for me. Theres things that he does that i don't agree with. I knew he had issues but today I found out more about him and the kind of person he is. I know he cares about me to but the things that he does i cannot allow myself to be with someone like that. In my mind i want to change him but i know he has to do that on his own and i need a guy thats good for me because i know i deserve better. I don't want him to know the things i found out because it will just cause drama so i just want to break up with him the best way possible. And im not sure if i should try to be his friend or just push myself away from him. Any thoughts on what to tell him?? Or how to say it. =( Thanks!!

20070524132153AAZxczP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm thinking about leaving my 15 yrs relationship with my boyfriend.  Is being single hard?	We have 2 boys, 2 and 13.  As the years progresses, we're just growing out of each other more and more.  Now it is to the point where I don't even want to be seen with him.  One thing that makes me think of leaving the most is the fact that we do not see eye to eye when it comes to disciplining the kids.  I beleive that the kids will be better off with me.  Of course he can see them but I will be the main provider.  So since I've been with him for a long time I'm just curious to know, what is one or two thing about being single that you regret.
20070524185648AAJjrHU	Family & Relationships;Family	Who can I contact about a teenage runaway?	my father was seeing a woman who had a child from a previous marriage. The mother past away about 2 yrs ago of cancer and my dad was left to care for this girl  now 13. My dad worked nights and never knew that this little girl would runaway because her mother would cover for her all the time. Now that she (the mom) has past my dad has noticed that she runs away for days and doesnt go to school doesnt call to say she's ok and when she comes back she acts as if nothing happens. My dad is tired of it and has 2 other kids one of which is autistic and he himself is getting bad headaches worrying about this girl. My dad has asked Family and Children Services for help and they were no help. The police have brought her home and he's even asked them for help. Which of course were no help. What other options does he have?

HOOKED      Hey, I met a guy yesterday in school. We talked and he seem facinated about my situation. Eventually he asked if we could get together and grab a sandwich at Micky D's. I said yes and he shocked me when he left by saying "Leave your hands at home." and he winked at me and smiled. I called him to come back and he said that he really wanted to go out with me without the "mechanics".       I think I'm going to do it. It will be strange not having hands but I think I can do it. What do you all think about it? Am I doing it right?      Cynda ... formerly "Hooked"

20070730081330AARLBJK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? Or is he just a player.?	So there is this guy that I work with and hes ten years older than me. Im 18 and hes 28. He has the physical attraction that im looking for and everyday he makes a point to come see me. Hes bought me lunch a few times and we just spent the whole day together over the weekend. I like him but he seems to be one of those player kind of guys. I have only known him for a week and hes already trying to get in my pants. I havent done it yet cuz it seems like thats all he wants. But then he looks a little nervous sometimes. Like he doesnt know what to say. He is 28 years old. Why would a 28 year old at like an immature high school student? Or would he?? I have told him that "Im a lady and you have to treat me good to get anywhere with me". And he said that he tells me that hes going to show me but still it seems like its all he wants. But then he always is calling me to see what im doing and when I was sick he offered to bring me soup and somthing to drink. What do you think??

20070806034347AAygIxj	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i even fix this?	i'm really lost.. please someone give me some advice.       i moved into my best friend's house about three months ago after inpatient treatment for an eating disorder. during my stay in the hospital, my parents suggested i move out again (which is very common with them..), so i finally took their advice.      the problem is that i'm miserable here. i miss my family. things dont seem to be working out well for me at all up here. i can't even find a job, i cant figure out a way to get back to school, i dont have a car.. or any space to breathe!      plus, i'm beginning to realize that this friend may not be a healthy person for me to be around... it's always a question of what type of mood she'll be in when you see her.      i'm thinking i want to move back home... i'm so scared to do that, provided the history that my parents have. i dont even know what to do. i see my life going down a path that i dont want it to. what in the world do i even do? in terms of friends and family. all opinions welcome.
20070823103000AATRWhB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm so confused.?	Last November, I met a pretty and nice young lady and I really started to like her.  We kept on talking, and I found out she had a boyfriend.  Ever since then, I've been trying to talk to her and sometimes I try to avoid her, but sometimes I still manage to run into her.  She seems pretty moody at times, and overall she's pretty quiet.      The last 2 weeks, I have been talking to some other girl.  She looks a lot like the first one, and she's so easy to talk to (even though she's taller than me).  The funny part is that I also met her on the same train line as the other one (except that I see this one on my way to work).  I think I really like her.      Anyways, yesterday I managed to peek at the first one as she was boarding the train home.  However, I decided to get in the other car.  I also left through the other exit, and walked rather than take the bus with her.  When I got home, I started crying.  I don't know, I think I still have feelings for her.  What should I do?  I'm so confused:(

I could then hear my own voice and his in the background. I could hear us speaking about what we had said earlier on in the conversation and when I asked him if he was recording us cos I heard our voices in the background, he said no he was just talking to his mum.   Why would he do this and why would he lie? I am really confused.

20080405143539AA3rtrM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Por que todavía hay chicas que piensan que la virginidad se nos entrega como un regalo muy preciado??	que tontería mas grande. Vamos ya a dejarnos de tonterías y ha hablar de la realidad:      1. Para mi no es ningun regalo, de hecho el solo hecho de tener que hacer de profesor me aburre y en esos casos casi no hay tiempo de pensar en mi propia satisfacción.      2. En el sexo una pareja entrega placer uno a otro, no es que uno goce mas que otro, y en ese caso, tecnicamente uno como hombre goza menos, ya que la mujer puede tener dos tipos de orgasmo y nosotros solo uno. Ademas las mujeres tienen mas zonas erógenas, sienten mas placer. de modo que el regalo es al contrario.      3. Una mujer con experiencia puede dar mas placer.      En conclusión dejense ya de tonterias y mogigaterias y bienvenidas al mundo real

We like the same music, and playing the guitar. Those very few moments with her were awesome, but now I'm starting to like her. She's shown some really subtle hints of liking me (I think). But with the vacation and everything, we've kind of separated, with me moving to other places, while she has her life to pursue. She keeps drifting into my mind, and I can't get her out. I just need to forget her for just a while.

20090127163550AATgMMj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does this happen...?? help! Guys' help mostly, Girls' help okay too?	Okay there is this guy that I like. All of my friends say that it seems like he likes me, and i have noticed some signs like:   1. He will be walking with his friends in a group ahead of my group and he will look back and stare at me    2. When standing next to me he always is touching me, like with his arm touching mine, or his hand on me, or whatever.   3. If i talk to one of his friends and he is somewhere else, his friend will go over to him, say something, and they both look at me.   4. He just looks at me and stares, either im standing there or walking by   5. On his good days, when I say hi, he gives me this really sexy smile and says hey and give me a really tight hug      You will probably say he likes me when I say he does those things but he sometimes does a 360 on me and is a B-Word towards me. For example when I say HI he will give me this weird, mean look towards me and will just wave and not say anything. Maybe he had a bad day or whatever, but idk.      All my friends have dreams about us being together (dont ask me why) and they think we would be a really cute couple.      My question is: Does he like me? or is it just a friendship realationship? What does he mean with his actions?   ALSO: Should I tell my friends that I like him, so they can try to get us together??      Sorry if I sound like a little kid who knows nothing, but I just have no idea what he means with his actions and he just confuses me.      please help! I just need to know what I should do!

I don't want to hurt his feelings or lead him on, because any relationship we would have would be long-distance. The last time I had a long distance relationship, it was a disaster and he was the one I talked to about it. So maybe he'd understand. But we have an overwhelming amount of heat and chemistry between us! Soon I'm seeing him for the first time since I moved away and I don't know what to do! (But I'd prefer it if we kissed at one point and then he left feeling happy)
20090309090822AAslEfn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend cheated on me.. what the **** is wrong with me?	I just found out my girlfriend(16 yrs old) of 5 months cheated on me(18 yrs old) like a week ago with her ex-boyfriend(20 yrs old). I loved her with all my heart and i did everything for her. I stopped hanging out with my friends, stopped drinking, stopped smoking pot and using pills. I'd sit at home all day and wait for her to get off work just so we could hang out. She would always lie to me about everything she did and she told me she loves me.. then i found out from him on her msn that she went over there like a week and a half ago and had sex with him and said she misses him and all this ****. and the day she did it she was supposed to be at work, but i called her work and she didnt have work that day. Her excuse was that she told me that so i wouldnt think she was doing other things because she was stuck at home all day.       After she cheated on me like the week and a half ago we broke up for like 4 hours until she came over  begging for me to get back together with her. So we got together again like 2 days ago and she promised me she was done playing games and that she would never lie to me again. And i asked her why she was messaging him on myspace and she said because his grandma was dying and she was just his friend. And he sent her a friend request on myspace saying "im sick of this **** we're over" i asked her and she said he meant as being friends.. i mean im not that dumb so i knew something was up. She gave me her hotmail password and i went on her msn and he sent her offline messages for like the last week asking her why she wasnt answering him and why she wouldnt hang out. And i started talking to him and he told me she came over like a week and a half ago saying she missed him and loved him and that she was single and he said they had sex and then after that he never answered her. And he said his grandma isnt sick at all.       So i ask her and she tried to lie to me saying she went over there and nothing happened. then i asked her again and she was like okay we kissed, and i asked her "did you **** him?" and she was like yeah.. so i told her it was over and all this stuff...      Now she is telling me shes pregnant with our baby and all this **** to try to get me back. And she told me she did it because she felt unloved.. and im just confused about it. i mean i did everything for her i told her she was beautiful everyday and that i loved her. I just want to know whats wrong with me and why she would do that.. i mean i know im not ugly i always have girls hitting on me everywhere and she always gets mad about it. i know its not sex because when we have sex (4-2 times daily) she orgasms like 10 times. I know she really does love me or she wouldnt be lying about being pregnant to try to get me back (shes not i made her take a prego test like 3 days ago and she went to the er for a heart tumor and i made the doctor give her an ultrasound when he was checking her ulcers). So is there something wrong with me? Or is she just a bad person...

Is it just a compliment or is there something behind it?     will the guy get offended if all i say everytime he compliments me is thank you?

20090309100806AAUiUaH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you make of it?	So there is a stunning girl who I bumped into a friends house - next time I met my friend she told me that her pretty friend thinks I am 'cute' - I ws flattered to find that out and I told my friend to tell her the same so she told her 'he thinks your rely pretty' - now over the weekend we met at a party and she knows that I found out about what she makes of me and visa versa.      So I wanted to familiarise myself to her I chatted normal with her - complimented her - lil bit of flirt too - but everytime I went close to her for a convo she would respond to what I ask her and then gently skip away or her best friend would come in and interfere or on occasions her sis - I found that confusing why they kept coming I have a feeling they already know about the situation.        Her best friend was a bit even more friendly she asked if I wanted to dance which I oblidged to - she said I am rely 'cool'      Basically I got compliments from her close ones but she herself kept skipping away WHY???      Is she embrassed that I know what she thinks of me???      Does she not feel the same or she dont want more???      Why would her friend keep interfering??? is she interested in me??? (Please no)      BTW we are matured people we both are 27!!!      She is stunning and I egt my share a attention too when am out.  But we dont see each other often .... how do I make things roll???

It wasn't me misreading the signals because my friends recognised the flirting as well. Even now after she rejected me she seems to crave my attention if I don't speak to her online for a night etc. even though we see each other at 6th Form every day.       Do you flirt just for the sake of it to get attention or like me do you think that you should only flirt with someone if you ACTUALLY like them.

He told my friend to shut up when she askes an important question & everyone laughs.   He calls on everyone but when he calls on me, I'm so nervous too say anything, because I'm scared of saying something stupid, so I end up saying idk.   He told our whole class once that we should all be sent back to pre-algebra because we couldn't multipy fractions. Now, we aren't dumb, and I'm postive ALL of us can multipy fractions, but he expects us to do it HIS way, with HIS extra steps; it gets confusing.    He does WAYY more than what I listed, but what should I do?! I'm so nervous and jumpy when he calls on me, so I forget everything. All I'm thinking about is, OMG OMG HE'S GOING TO MAKE FUN OF ME :(

20090309134839AAbZ9Aq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I win her trust back?	This lass who i adore so much, she means everything to me. We text everyday used to meet up, go drinking, watch films together, she'd tell me anything what was wrong with her, i looked out for her.   She has a psycho bf, who hits her, stops her from leaving her mums house, checks her phone, stops her from working and talking to guys etc.    Three weeks ago she tells me someone has been texting her saying her bf is cheating on her, i heard something about this as we live in a small village, however she thought it was me and we never talked for 4 days then she apoligised and we made up and we went normal, however her bf claimed to have changed and keeps trying to make an effort to keep her :( although she said it wont last long. Then last week someone put petals on her car and she thinks its me and so does her mum but it wasnt me, i wasnt even any where near her.   She said she thinks its me or something to do with me and hardly speaks to me no more although she text me last night when she was upset about something but wouldnt say what, and she wont meet up either.      Help how do i win her trust back?

I have been crushing on this guy for a while now and I don't know, he seems like he'd be a great guy to get to know and I have never felt so captivated by a person ever. I know that trying to get two shy people together can be very hard to do and it is tearing me up inside. I am pretty certain that he still likes me but whenever I try to talk with him, I either second think it, or he walks away from me. I guess I am asking if I should pursue him or would I be better off trying to forget him. I just don't think my heart can handle this confusion.

20090309124726AASvs0l	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help with my friend?	My best friend just randomly decided to stop talking to me a few months ago. When I asked her why, she said she "couldn't tell me." I tried everything. I tried to leave her alone and not talk to her for a few weeks then tell her "hey." She would either not answer, or say "I don't think so!" So, I just left it alone because I thought it wasn't worth it.  I really miss her and she doesn't even care. She spreads rumors about me and tries to make all my friends hate me by lying to them about things I said about them. I'm in 8th grade and I had to be home schooled this year for several family reasons. So, I really need friends to talk to everyday since I don't really see people my age that much and I have lots of things going on with my family. But, she's getting people to hate me more and more. She already made one of my other friends hate me and is acting just like her. She controls who talks to me and everything! I talk to this guy that she also talks to and she told him to stop talking to me and she made up all kind of lies to make him stop. Thankfully, he didn't because he's more mature than her. She even made my boyfriend break up with me because she lied to him!! Then, she just laughed!! I'm really fed up with it. I miss her so much and I don't know what happened! Please help!!
20090309134552AAieqXR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i make him leave me alone?	so i met this guy.. he seemed nice enough so i hung out with him a few times.. we got drunk and i told him i didnt want to do anything sexually.. well he kept on and kept on so finally we did even though i didnt want to... then he kept telling me he missed and how he would love me for the rest of my life.. this creeped me out since i had only known him a few weeks so i told him not to tell me he missed me and that we were nothing more than friends.  he wouldnt stop so i flat out told him there was nothing between us and there never would be that i would appreciate it if he would not call or text me any more... he continued to text me which i ignored for awhile but last week i just got fed up with it and replied to him again that he needs to leave me alone.  he said that he wanted closure and wanted to see me once more time and asked if he could come over that night.. that totally creeped me out and i said no me saying goodbye is the only closure you are getting.. that was the last time i texted him but he STILL keeps texting me, i have not replied to anything since i told him goodbye.. so HOW DO I MAKE HIM STOP and leave me the hell alone????     i tried to block his # but apparently you cant do that with my cell company.. i asked the police what i can do and they said i could file a restraining order.. and i guess if it comes to that i will.. but so far he was not done anything to harm me or make me think that he would... its just sooo damn annoying... any suggestions?????

20090309155728AA7Hxx9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy says he only wants me to invite mypretty friends to event...I say he's being superficial...who is right?	Please tell me who is right in this...I'm sending the responses to the guy.      Okay this guy I have been seeing for 2 months is going to rent a yacht with him and his friends for this big water event they have in our city in a few months. He invited me and when he asked me to bring friends he continually mentioned that they had to look good. I took offense and said I shouldn't choose what friends go based on their looks but on who I want to hang out with and who will have a fun time and bring a great personality to the party. His argument is that if his friends are paying for the boat and the girls get on free then they should be girls that his friends would enjoy mingling with (good looking). I don't see why it matters because his friends are inviting girls as well...in fact there will probably be more girls then guys on the boat.      Does he have a right to suggest I only invite friends that fit the part for what they are attracted to or am I right in thinking that he is being superficial and sexist and he should want fun people to come...not just base women on their looks especially if either way the women are not going to end up with his friends?

20090309123056AA732Pv	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is this guy doing?? Does he hate me or is he making fun of me?	I had some strong eye contact with a guy last year in the hallway at school. He was just looking at me so I looked at him back. There was no smiling or anything...pretty much a stare down and then I had to look away.      I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.
20090309153217AAde4Wf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean?(guys and girls)?	Ok so I asked one of my guy friends to ask this other guy what he thinks of me. He responded that he thinks I'm "kinda cute" but wishes that I would talk to him more and that he really likes my personality. What does that even means and how should I react?!?
20090309124914AAuqTst	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ignore my bf for a week to teach him a lesson?	He hasnt been showing me he cares, not just recently, but for a while now. He has a tendency to blow me off for friends (I guess its not 100% his fault, but he could at least call me to tell me plans have changed...) and he doesnt think its important to talk to me everyday, but I do. He will say "ill call you tomorrow" and when tomorrow comes its like 10 pm and than he calls me. Or sometimes, it will end up that I call him. He never tries to like the the things I do, even though I do for him. He hates going out to places to walk, and I love doing that. He seems really busy with school work (college), and he will tell me he cant talk to me for a while because of it, but next time I talk to him he is complaining about he didnt get any work done because he was with friends....      He blew me off the other day to help his friend with HW, but he didnt even call me.... im thinking about not calling him for a week or ignoring his phone calls for a week to teach him a lesson.... I dunno if it would work, it would be really difficult to do though...      AND PLEASE DONT TELL ME TO DUMP HIM. Maybe for you people, its easy to just throw your relationships around, but weve been together for 2 years and I -do- love him. Its not that easy to just say BYE and find some one new.

20090309151414AAfoHys	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you move on from your first love? :(?	I am so misreable. I feel like I am not special in my boyfriend's eyes. He is my first love, my first boyfriend, and he's my "first time", so I know it's going to be difficult but lately I am just about to give up on him. He's so two-faced it's unbelieveable; One minute he loves me, the next I'm just the girl he sleeps with and hangs out with. We've been together for a year and almost five months now. He has hurt me many times in the past, which haunts me now. I just want to forget. I just want to leave and never look back, but it's so hard when I think about him acting like the sweet boy I've fallen in love with...      How did you guys moved on from your first love? Please I need some advice... :(

20090309142308AAoHrsJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Alright need both female and male help......?	um...i don't know were to start on this. I have a crush on this girl (for about 1 1/2 years now) and she is coming into my class next year. She doesn't know me, and shes very popular (i am too but not with her). I think i have caught her staring at me lately but im not sure because she always looks away and i am questioning my imagination now). She also has this friend who absolutly DOESN'T like me. two friends who hate me, actually. And she hangs out with them constantly. When i try to talk to her (it takes a while for me to be able to actually try) they like tell me to leave or get away or something. How should i try to talk to her for her to get to know me? Few more details - we meet twice a week, im homeschooled, and i usually don't have trouble talking to girls. And i hide my feelings well (eg i don't look at her for like a really long time or act shy around her, etc...)   hope you guys can help,   Mr. T

One of my best friends is really mad at me because I looked inside her locker at school when she told me not to. I apologized to her but she keeps ignoring me. She won't answer text messages or anything. It is really starting to bug me because we usually get along so well. What can I do to make her talk to me again and forgive me?
20090309130335AA1hNK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long have you and your partner been dating?	Just curious. How long have you and your current partner been dating? OR how long was your longest relationship? You can answer either one or both. Your choice.
20090309125509AAut6mv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he sending mixed signals??? he wants me to come--only to ignore me?	It's guys like him.. that make me think about girls.   (haha, I'm kidding)      Okay, but seriously here's my situation:      This guy I use to work with got ahold of my cell/facebook/myspace/AIM ... and Ive been talking with him for awhile now.  Well, he always.. ALWAYS flirts with me, and I recently went to a play that he was in (and my friends).  Anyway, so I get there and I went to say congrats to him after it was all done.. And he totally blew me off.      He turned and was lyke "thnx 4 comin..bye"   ...........UM?   Well lateron that night he called me lyke 3 times and texted me several and was like "hey...sorry" and such    and then on AIM the next day he came up with these excuses lyke 'i waz talkin 2 this lady who i kno and i had to chose to be mean to 1 of u' .......???  But then he goes to say how he really would have loved to talk to me more and how he went looking for me, but didnt know i left         what the hell is wrong with this guy  or am i crazy in thinking he lykes me.. even tho he flirts all the time?????????????????         ps.  i went to this thing bcuz he begged me for weeks to come so i finally gave in
20090309133937AAtWlQc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell him without feeling dumb, that I'm not getting enough of it?	My boyfriend and I have been together for about 1 1/2yrs. Sex was not and everyday thing but at least it was twice during the week and once during the weekend. Since he switched hours and started working 2nd shift he doesn't even make a move when he gets home at 2am unless I do, but of course I want it. Then Friday comes along and he's home and still nothing. Last Sat. he said "Tonight I just want to cuddle." In my mind, I was like WTF!      I know he's not cheating because he's too busy with work and school, plus I have access to his e-mail, facebook and phone.       I'm getting tired of always being me chasing him for sex, so finally this sat I asked him if he was sexually attracted to me and he said "Of course, why would you ask such a stupid question."       Perhaps because instead of having some intimate time together the days that he has off, he rather go to sleep... But I didn't say that... I just walked away.       So, how would I bring it up to him, I've made comments before but it's not helping...      Thanks in advance.
20090309122439AAOL1Dc	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP ME! PARENTS EVENING TOMORROW!?	okay well basically I really want to be a doctor when i'm older, and i've recently discovered that to become one I will need to do well in chemistry. I'm good at chemistry so it's okay. However, recently in chemistry lessons these two girls who sit in front of me and a friend have been turning round at us, whispering about us, giggling and imitating us - even laughing at us when we got anything wrong. We told the teacher and asked if we could move and so we did today but it still carried on throughout the test. This caused me to get a very low mark (along with being distracted in previous lessons). However, my parents are convinced that i am good at chemistry and i keep telling them that i am. But today, after the test my teacher read out a list of names of people he needed to see at parents evening, and my name was on the list (because of my bad grades). I then literally begged him not to see my parents and he said it was that or a phonecall home. So after that i was like 'well it's not my fault that i've got bad grades it's just that i keep being distracted!' so he goes to the student manager and tells on the girls who were annoying me and my friend. Now the girls are gonna be a hundred times worse, and i have to sit there listening to my teacher go on about my bad grades to my parents who will be disappointed in me - but it's not my fault! I know that if i tell them then they won't help me, so what should I do?   PLEASE ANSWER SOON!! :(
20090309131225AAEv5GI	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm worried about my friend?	My best friend split up with her boyfriend last month, a good move as he was making her unhappy, but as a way of getting over it, she's been sleeping around quite a bit. She's absolutley gorgeous and could have anyone she wanted, but just goes to parties, gets really drunk and gets with anyone. I've told her this, and asked her why she's doing it, to which she just replied 'I just like having sex, and as long as people don't find out about it I wont be called a slut'. I mean obviously I'd never say anything, but these things do get out and I'm just worried aout her.. she's also been really obsessing over her appearance and can't seem to talk about anything else. This just isn't like her, she's one of the least superficial people I've ever met and this change in personality is quite a shock. What can I do to support her?
20090309140908AAokVrp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is holding me back from asking her out?	I went out with this girl like 1 year and a half ago. Now, I still have feelings for her. I liked her for like 2 weeks now. She makes me happy. We never talk though. I look at her a lot because I think that she is so beautiful. She looks at me sometimes, but I don't think she likes me. I try to smile at her when she is looking at me, but something stops me. I think I am afraid of rejection, but I don't know what is holding me back from asking her out though. Earlier today, I was going to ask her out, but then I just stopped. I don't know why though. I really like her. When I was going out with her, it was so amazing. We both really, really liked each other a lot. What is holding me back from asking her out? Questions? Comments? What is holding me back from asking her out? Thank you.      P.S. You can e-mail me through my link about it if you want. Also, I am a 13 year old male.
20090309132305AAC94Fc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IDK if I want to be with him anymore?	I love my boyfriend to death, I really do...but, I feel like things are moving to fast. He wants to get a place together, and all this stuff, and he acts like things will work out perfectly because "we love each other"...I don't think he's looking at it as realistically as I am. He doesn't have a job or his license or permit and we are almost getting ready to graduate! He doesn't know what he wants to do, and he doesn't really want to go to college...And admittedly, I do like have little crushes on other guys, but I do not cheat. But I usually never even think about other guys, but now I'm starting to think, maybe I'd rather be single until I'm done with school and what not. My brother says he doesn't think things are going to work between me and my boyfriend, and I'm starting to think, maybe they aren't either?...Idk, it's just so hard to think about life without him. We've been best friends for so long, and we do love each other...but I'm just starting to have doubts...What should I do?
20090309125145AAz1eYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel really bitchy, did I do the right thing?	Ok, so me and my ex are friends, but still kind of on bad terms. Well, he's 20, and I'm 17. And he decided he would add all my friends on myspace who are even younger than me. And he's been talking about really sexual things with them and some of them are 14! And he is kind of freaking them out. But they are too nice to say anything to him about it. But...I reported him for abuse on myspace....And now I feel really bad. I don't know if he will get in a lot of trouble for that, and I really don't want him to know it was me. So I hope the report is anonymous. But still...it seemed really bitchy to do. But at the same time, he was doing something bad...Was I right or wrong?
20090309130008AAqFsdG	Family & Relationships;Friends	I reported a "friend" on myspace, was I wrong to do so?	So, me and my ex are kind of friends, but still kind of on bad terms. Well, he's 20, I'm 17. And he decided he would start to add my friends on myspace that are even younger than ME! And he's been talking about his penis to them and that they are hott and other sexual stuff. And yea, it makes me mad and jealous, he even asked me if it was okay to add my friends because he wants a hook up and I said I guess if you want to [even though I really didn't want him to]. And he could have added my older friends like 18+, but no he's adding the ones that are like 15 and younger. He started to make one of them feel really uncomfortable and she told me so...so, I reported him on myspace for abuse....But now I feel really bitchy about it. And I HOPE the report is anonymous. Did I do the right thing?

20090309145246AAaEF6b	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help him become sober?	Well, I'm only 14 but I have this friend who went to a techno party at an arcade with me and my best friend. He's 17 and he's been through some hell. He was raised in "the ghetto" and his father was abusive and a drug dealer while his mom was a prostitute because his dad sold her out to men and bars.      Anyway, he's been drinking since he was 12 and he still goes to school and doesn't wish to drop out, but he wants to write manga (he goes to Japan every summer and loves anime and manga just as much as I do) But he's so sweet and kind and awesome!      But at the party there were some college students who got drunk and started bothering my friend and I took care of it but he said he wants to change really badly because he feels like it was unbelievably rude of him to show up drunk and he didn't notice what happened (which wasn't anything).      I'm his best friend, and I just want what's best for him because I really like him. How can I help him become sober though? Is there anything at all I can possibly do? I REALLY wanna help him T___T He's trying so hard... He got emancipated when he wa 15 and moved out. He's rich now though from working all the time.      He says it's really hard on him because he buys alcohol and stuff about every month and he has about $600 worth of liquor left in one of his cabinets and he's tempted but the only reason why he's fighting it is because o me, so I feel like I just really really wanna be there for him even more than I already am.

On the weekend we we're hanging out, we went on a trip to calgary on the bus with other people from our group.   there are older girls who sat in the back while i sat with him, we chatted for a while and i felt very confident talking openly with him and all, then he ditched me and went to go and talk to the girls in the back, i think it made me jealous somehow i think. then he moved seats i followed him and then he moved away from me to go and talk with the girls again. when he talks to me its mainly about the things we share in common. so i sat alone on the bus since he moved, feeling some mixed emotions. i just need advice, how should i approach him and all      Thank you

20090309152110AAniL6j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm mad at my boyfriend. I wanna break up with him for being a jerk. What should I say when I call him?	He told a girl that he had a gf, which is me and then told her that he likes her.      When I told him I needed I break from him, he didn't give a $hit. He didn't say anything he just smiled and pretended to be all happy.      Why would he do that after 3 months that we have been together? Didn't it mean anything to him? He kept telling me that i met more to him than his own da,mn family. What's the matter with him?      And whenever I'm sad, why doesn't he try n cheer me up. that's all I need. but no he has to go and be sad too. how is that gonna make me feel any better if my own bf cant make me laugh when i'm down.      he may cry over me, and that does kinda show that he cares for me. but why can't he fight for me y is he too chicken to help me when I'm sad was he pretending to be happy just because his friend was there?      What should I tell him when I call him?

It's been one month since the guy I like asked out another girl and I'm still not over this guy.  It's not that I'm all depressed because of him, but he's still all I ever think about.  We've never even gone out.   I think mostly I'm just not over it because he was the first guy who ever liked me, so there's sort of like a natural attachment there (but I made a mistake and that's why he asked out the other girl).  How much longer will it take to get over it?

Then again the next day i saw his friends pushing him towards me and he was like going back again and again laughingly.

20090309133557AAwcFj7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What if my mom won't let me date him because he comes with a lot of "baggage?!?!?!"?	Ok, well, about 4 months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've basically become best friends since then, but I've liked him as more than a friend for a while... So this weekend, I finally let him know that I like him as more than a friend, and he said he liked me back... But anyways, he's very emotional, and he's metro... A lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms, and because he's really into fashion and stuff... But I think the reason he's so emotional is because of his past... His parents both got shot in an awful accident when he was very young... And worst, he saw it happen... So he's lived with every family member (But he seemed to keep losing everyone he loved), and he's been in foster care (Still is, but may be adopted.) He's never had a stable home... It's awful, but he's a very strong person, because he's still so positive and everything. He's a really loving person, and very touchy-feely. So today, there was no school, and he came over, and we went for a walk, and he kissed me. <3 lol But the thing is, my mom doesn't know we're dating yet... She loves Nathaniel... but that's with him being just my friend... She's said that having a relationship with someone like him isn't good, because they come with so much "baggage," and such a hard past, that the emotions and everything make the relationship too hard and almost impossible to keep going... But Nathaniel doesn't seem like the kind of person who would let his emotions from what happened get in the way... I honestly think that us being together, either as friends, or dating, is good for him because... well, he just needs someone to love him... And I want to be that person... What if my mom won't let me date him, though? I really, really like him, and I'm SO happy that we told each other how we feel... what should I do?!?! What do you think??
20090309155758AAv8mFu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE answer?!?!?! He has a hard past?!?!?!?

20090309131739AACjB8Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was this guy inpressed on how I looked that day!?	I wore a blue gown, we went to a banquet that day, later on I had to go to a evening affair which required us to wear red so I changed into my red gown which is the same make as the blue one. Anyway, a friend of mine who constantly ignores me, called me to him and begin to talk to me just flirting away.  I was in another room he came and stood next to me, then he called me into a vacant private room and just begin to flirt with me. That day he said I looked real nice touched my dress and rubbed my legs the gown was to my knees.  Then he gave me a hug and picked me off of the ground and smiled at me. When I changed into my red outfit he called me into that same room and was showing me a catalog of what he wanted to purchase or something.  I think he just wanted to be around me still because he knew I was leaving to go to the other event.

I enrolled in a free dating site and each time I begin chatting with a new guy, at first he seems interested but then a few weeks later, he acts like he doesn't want to be bothered.

He decided to be on a break because he can't handle it I guess because he's a senior getting ready for college and he has track and work and also school. I'm a sophomore and this is my first boyfriend and I really like him we would of been going out for 4 months. And we talked what were going to be doing and were going to be on a break I'm going to give him his space and when he's ready to back with each other he will let me know. But last week he would still text me and talk to me like everything is fine. I really want to get back with each other. But I don't know what's going to happen because I think he's confused and he's in his own world. So I really don't know what to do. What do you think of this????????? And like it's hurting me so much it's like my feelings are crushed =0(...   Thanks!!!
20090309121706AA2UFN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really need advice on what to do?	My boyfriend out of the blue told me he wants a break. He wouldn't tell me why but just that he doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. He also said he's not doing it to be with other girls and he loves me and wants to get back together and that he doesn't want me to move on. He said he's not using this as a way to make breaking up easier, he just really needs a break.      What do I do and why do you think he's doing this? The only thing I can think of is that he has been really busy with work and stuff and he's been really stressed out because of it. We also live farther away now then we used to by about half an hour and he hasn't had much money for gas lately. I've also been kind of giving him a hard time about not seeing him as much...so that's the only thing I can think of.

20090309155935AAiJjFs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I hook up with a girl I never talk to and barely know?	I want to hook up with her. I don't really know her except she was a friend's sister that I barely knew years ago. I'm trying to flirt with her over Facebook. What should I say next? She just added a Facebook app so all message will go directly to her phone. Here's our conversation so far (start at the bottom when reading):      her:   Haha this is a late response but I don't pay too much attention to my facebook, I got a bunch of texts haha pretty much it. I bet you had a bunch of secret admirers!      me:   lol, it's not that bad. how was your v-day? I bet you got got a ton of stuff from secret admirers and such :P      her:   [name of college] is alright haha I think my teacher is crazy   how are you liking it?       me:   hey, how's [funny name for college]? :P
20090309140904AAXVxsr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does a kiss on the nose mean from a guy in this sense?	This guy and I have been stepping around each other for ages. We both want to hookup, but by circumstances we haven't just a gentle kiss, and him always holding me and doing many other cute things. But that isn't the point. Just wondering if in this case, when he was holding me in his lap the other day and he kissed my nose, what this meant?   Thanks
20090309134633AASQYrW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i say this without him really realising?	Ok, I'll start from the beginning:   I had a crush on this guy at school called Will, and then he started going out with someone because she asked him out, then a couple of weeks ago she dumped him and he seemed really upset.   Then the next day one of the boys in my form told me that someone fancied me and i was trying to figure out who.   Then on Friday, me and my best friend were talking to his best friend and i mentioned what the person had said the other day and if he knew who it was, so he told me he didn't know but that Will fancied me before he started going out with the girl, and that it might be him and since last week, everyone has being saying that has a crush on me again (they were doing this before)      So the problem is i don't specifically have a crush on him any more, i'd go out with him if he asked me but I don't know how to ask him if he likes me, remember i'm 12, and plz don't say ''you are too young to be going out at your age'', because it is your opinion and i don't happen to think that and by saying that you are not going to get yourself a best answer      Anyway...   Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance

20090309134950AAEQOK1	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I tell my religious friends that I'm bisexual?	I'm a 16 year old female in the UK who is now pretty sure that I'm bisexual. Trouble is,although I personally am not religious, my two best friends are - one is Hindu, and homosexuality is against her religion, and the other belongs to a slightly more obscure religion, which also does not condone homosexuality. I feel like I cannot be truly myself around them (neither of whom I am sexually attracted to) unless I tell them, but I'm afraid that if I do, our relationships will be, if not completely destroyed (which I feel is a distinct possibility) then severely affected - both of them worrying that I fancy them or something. I really don't know how to confront the issue. Please help.
20090309134642AATclXf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One for the guys really, anyone can answer?	I got a text from an ex, about 9pm last night on my old mobile. Just asking how I was. (We've not spoken for about 3 months, split about a year ago).   So I text him back at 1am this morning, saying I was fine, gave him my new mob no. Asked him how he was.   He replied to new mobile, just saying he was fine and that he'd had a lazy day today, and commented that I must have had a late one last night!   I just told him I'd got up for a glass of water and had an urge to check old phone. (Which is how it was).      Why do guys text exes? What do you think he wants?      I know no-one can know what someone else is thinking but just some opinions on this would be nice.   Thanks
20090309135108AAInF8p	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends don't like my other friend?	I have a friend called corrine, and i introduced her to my friends. she sat at my table for a good two days. then my friend (kinda best, but whatever), says to everyone on the table about how she doesn't like corrine and she says the dumbest stuff. two days later, apparently "corrines really stupid".. and everyone was laughing behind her back. they purposely made it obvious that they were talking to her.        Corrine got the message and told me that she didn't really feel like hanging out with us anymore. so then today, her bus pass got stolen, and she had to walk home, and i offered to walk with her. (me walking with her meant that i wouldn't go home with the gang). i was talking to them with corrinne while they were waiting for the rest of the gang to come. then one of my friend sees Corrine and starts running.        I'm really upset, what should i do...

20090309123558AA13y8o	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship & Boy Troubles?  Please help!?	Recently, a really hot guy has told me that he likes me.  I'm overjoyed and I like him too.  But the problem is that my other friend likes him too and she has longer than I have.   I know that there's the rule, never let a boy come between friends, but she's very ignorant when it comes to these things.     She knows he likes me, and she's obviously upset about it, but I can't do anything about it or my feelings for him either.  She posts these nasty status messages on networking websites about how she's upset and other things.      We've had this problem before too.  There was another boy who she liked for a longer period of time than me, but we got together.  We still remained friends though but we stopped being so close. She eventually got over it but it wasn't my faulut because I didn't know she liked him.  But now I do know who she likes and unfortunately, I like him too.      Please help me, I don't know what to do!   Thank you(=

20090309145659AA8MjUQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i make friends ( i need answers badly)?	i have barely 1 friend, and everyone else makes fun of me for being overweight when 3 other girls are my size. one of the most popular girls in my class is bigger than me. when they make fun of me, they do it for no reason. if i walk by, they say something rude. and the girl bigger than me calls me "big girl" or " hey there big girl!" i hate it! even other kids in different grades make fun of me. like this one kid, and he usually says something like this, "do you exercise? if you do, do you have a sandwich?" for this one kid, he is bigger than me and he's bowl-legged. he also twitches his eye, and it hilarious! (if you have a twitch in your eye, i'm only saying its funny when he does it) how do i become popular? i don't even do anything unless someone says something to me. do you have any tips or suggestions to make me popular or any good comebacks? i am basically desperate!   i cry a lot, and there's this school that you can go to if you have any mental disorders such as adhd, bipolar, asbergers, behavioral disorders, or social issues. i have adhd, social issues. and behavioral issues, so i am asking my psychiatrist if i can go there. should i? i really need answers!!!!!

20090309142558AArWBuY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl trying to give me a hint that she's not into me?	This question will make more sense if you read this first:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       After two weeks, I finally saw this girl that I sent the flowers to. I didn't get a chance to talk to her long, since she was busy at work with a customer. She thanked me for the flowers, said it was nice and she was surprised. I said I didn't want to get her in trouble at work, so I slipped her my phone number and told her to call me if she wanted to talk or hang out--or something like that I was REALLY nervous!! I said bye and left.  I am also worried that I didn't write anything down at all-- or worse yet, the wrong phone number!!      Did I pretty much screw myself by giving her my phone number? I know it's better to get a girl's phone number, but I thought this way she would call me if she really liked me or wanted to talk. It's been three days and she hasn't called yet... should I give up hope? I also go into the bank once a week, and am nervous to go in again next week, if I see her again... :( Any suggestions?
20090309122356AA3vgoV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	10 points! How can I make it up to my boyfriend?	Yesterday, my boyfriend went through my Answers account while I was out of my room for about an hour.   He did because sometimes I minimize the screen on here when he comes in the room because I'm afraid he'll freak out when I'm asking a question about something that may bother him.   When he told me, I got really upset that he would do that.   Another reason why he went through is because I'm having some issues with my first love, who broke up with me about a year ago because of distance. My first love admitted to still loving me, and that was a pretty painful time for me when I found that out, as well as my current boyfriend when he found out because he was afraid of not having a girlfriend the next day, as he told me.   I really want to show my boyfriend that I chose him over my first love for a reason - because he's perfect for me and because I love him with all of my heart! :)   How can I do that?      And be real with your answers, please.

20090309124901AAytMWS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok now there's major confusion?	I know this is long, but please just hear me out!!!!      I spoke to my bf yesterday. I tried to brake it off with him. It hurt me so badly to even think about braking up with him when I saw him. I do love him so much. When he moved away 3 years ago I thought my life was over and it took me so long to just put the feelings I had for him to the back of my mind. Then I saw him at the store over 4 months ago, and it felt like all the feelings I had for him came rushing back and crashed into me. When I'm with him I feel so... so alive I guess you could put it. I know I said I liked someone else before and that's why I'm so confused. The guy I like is great and he can relate to me. But my bf right now actually understands me in some odd retrospect. No ones ever really been able to understand me before. When I saw him yesterday I told him that I didn't think it was going to work between us. He told me to think about the decision I'm about to make, then he came over to me, hugged me, and told me that he loves me. That he always has and always will.    You have no idea how hard it was for me not to tell him that same exact thing. Because its true.   My best friend came with me and when we left my bf's house I told my friend that I wanted to tell him that I loved him so badly and how hard it was for me not to. I've been in love with him ever since I met him all those years ago. He was the only one that I've ever loved and will always love.   The thing is that the person that I like is amazing and we get along really well.   Please can someone help me... Please

20090309115745AAbKWAa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who should i invite to the concert?	im getting three tickets (for my father, myself, & a guest) to a concert and i dnt know who the guest should be. i narrowed it down to two people and i can't decide which one should come along. they both adore the band like I do.      person A - has been my bestfriend since we were kids. she lives 5 hours away, but she has family here & is always visiting here so it is most likely that her dad would allow her to come (plus the concert is in the summer). she took me to a concert about 5 years ago - but since then i have already taken her to multiple places such as new york and canada. since i've known her for a while, i know shes comfortable being around my dad. we're always talking about how we'd die if we ever meet the band. being with her is fun but at times she requires alot of attention.      person B - my bestfriend who actually lives here. she threw me a suprise party for my birthday last year and honestly, i did nothing for hers. we are always together though. just today one of my friends was like "whenever i see [person B] i always see you." she's fun as well, but can get really annoying after a while. when i casually mentioned to her that my dad plans to get tickets, she didnt seem excited .. it could have just been that she was preoccupied with something else though. also, she hasnt been doing alot lately since money is tight (but not to an extreme) so this could be nice for her.      if you were in my shoes, would you invite person A or B? i really need help =/      *getting a forth ticket is out of the question. and because im somewhat young, having my dad give up his ticket is not a good idea either.

But he started talking to me on Facebook just sending me messages saying "Did I see you yesterday?" "I swear you were at the theatre since I work their!"      just random stuff like that.      He wants my msn and I gave it to him and he wants to chat.      But what should I say? I have not had much experience chatting to women and "No" experience chatting up men either.      I really don't know what to say, I don't even know if he thinks I'm gay or if he is trying to chat me up?      What should I say?      Help
20090309142414AAEQ8pG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys do you cry a lot in private? males only?	I told my uncle that i thought guys don't have feelings because I've never seen a guy cry for love like when a girl dumps him or when a wife dies. My uncle says that guys do cry but in private. He says that he would cry in his own room and he made sure no one saw him cry. And he also says that guys get drunk in order to be able to cry and talk to his friends about problems because ppl see that is more acceptable for a drunk man to cry b/c he does not know what he is doing. But than again i heard guys saying that they only cry when a family member dies. So do you guys cry a lot but keep in private or hardly cry at all?
20090309154644AAlyb5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys if a girl did this to you, would you think she doesnt like you?	ok so this guy likes me very much,and i dont know why but i didnt show any interest to him liiike when...he talks to me i dont say much back like i answer yes and no and etc. and everytime hes near me i pretend that i dont see him until he comes talk to me and everytime he walks by me he like brushes against me or like mess with my hair and i just look and say nothing (its sooo cute) but anyways    now he doesnt talk to me but he still brushes against me etc.   i think he wants me to follow him but i dont think i want to follow him cuz when he does do that he just turns around and smiles then walks away   and today i kinda bumped into him on accident and he didnt do anything!   i think he thinks i dont like him   and when he doesnt talk to me, it makes me feel like he doesnt like me anymore   so my feelings for him will disapeer a little      i feel like he doesnt want me to talk to him      what should we talk about if i go talk to him?   does it seem like he thinks i dont like him?   if it were you, would you think i didnt like you?
20090309160344AAkR2ok	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy trooublless??please help me!!?	Okay, theress thiss guy that I really, really like. I have liked many guys before but I never liked a guy as much as I like him. But the problem is I am scared to death to talk to him. I really want to get to know him better. I really want to walk up to him and just start casually talking, but its not that easy for me. I am a shy person. I try my hardest not to stare at him because thats just a little bit creepy. I'm kind of sad all the time because I just can't talk to him. Liking him is eating me up inside because I am just keeping quiet about it. I'm not saying anything. I just sit there wishing he would come up to me and start talking. I have his cell number but I am afraid to text him.       I just don't know what to do anymore. Its difficult to go about your daily life knowing the guy you really like just doesn't understand the way you feel.    I cry myself to sleep every night because that I don't have him.          Any advice?   PLEASE don't tell me just go up and start talking to him. Because its not that easy for me to do.      Thanks soo much
20090309143259AAUvgrW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He won't accept any physical contact!?	Hi,      I've liked my best friend for awhile now. I just told him and we just started going out. I've always known that he isn't big on physical contact, but I thought that would vanish after we started dating. needless to say, it really hasn't. I can brush his arm or pet his head (hehe), but that's about it. Whenever I try to hold his hand, he gets REALLY sweaty, and last weekend I tried to kiss him and he took my shoulders and looked into my eyes and said "well aren't you the eager beaver?". I mean, I don't mind this. I would still date him regardless. It's his mind I'm in it for. But a little physical contact would be nice. Why is he doing this, and what should I do?
20090309150243AAJUuMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did he tell me this?	Okay so I have this guy friend and he was going out with this girl he has been in love with for like ever. And she recently broke up with him so he IMed me saying they broke up and I didn't get the message when he was still online so the next day I wastalking to him and he brought it up again. Why did he do that...or and btw I really really really like him and he sorta knows it.
20090309125218AAbYvcM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it okay to pay for someone else?	I am 17, I know, it's young, but I'm an honor student and very achieved so here's what I need ur advice on...      The choir at my school is going on a trip to Hawaii this summer & I have no issue of paying for myself, but my girlfriend which we've been dating for almost a month & have been priorly best friends for two years is having trouble affording any of it.    Is it okay to pay for her? If so, I will need it back, so do I do a contract? I just need all I can get because this is new for me & it's an opportunity like no other to spend time with me, chorus buddies, perform, represent the state of FL, and tour Hawaii! It's $1550 a person.      Thank you so much!   Chris

I went out with this girl like 5 weeks ago but she told me she wasn't interested in starting a relationship. (Yeah, maybe she was just being nice in saying she didn't find me attractive). At any rate, would it freak her out if I called her and be like, "what's up, just thut I call and say hi?"

20090309135557AADrMnw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you put yourself out there, showing that you are interested?	So, i've had a lot of self-esteem issues throughout my life, and i think that i am finally able to say that i think i am a pretty girl.       in the past, whenever i found out that a boy liked me, i immediately pulled away, and completely ignored them. because only a weird guy would like an ugly girl, or so i thought.      and now, with my new mindset, i want to be able to put myself out there, but its realllllly hard. sometimes i don't know if a guy likes me or not, (eg. i feel this connection with this guy who is kinda popular with the ladies, haha, and i am not popular with the fellas) and i dont know!      so all in all, i don't know how to flirt.   i can (sometimes) start a conversation, but it needs to be a really good day for that to happen.
20090309122547AAVd8WX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would she do that?!?!?!?	OK so I was at lunch on Friday and I was sitting with my friends, blah blah blah. So, I went to use the restroom and my "friend" decided it would be funny to go through my stuff and embarrass me. I didn't leave my purse with her or anything, but I trusted her enough to watch my other stuff. So when I came back I sat down and she took something out from behind her. I was like OK, until I saw what it was. Some stuff and "personal items". She's laughing and is like "What's this?" and all that junk. I was really mad at her and I was trying to talk to her about it, you know why I thought what she did was wrong, but she was being really immature and every time I tried to say something she would be like, to my other friends (who were in on this and laughing along with her) "Do you guys hear something?" and "I'm sorry but I don't speak to people that don't have a sense of humor or that would be stupid enough to get mad about that". So in my last class of the day that I have with her, she asked me why I got mad and I said I felt like I couldn't trust her. She got really mad and after the bell rang she went to my other friends and said I was mad at them, hated them, basically made me sound like a b**ch. What I need to know is should I still be her friend? Sorry for this being so long but I really need to know.
20090309142401AAiscYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you tell by what she said if she likes me?	Tyler - Why are you never on facebook? lol   Anyways.. my father used to paint on a daily basis when he was younger. His paintings are scattered on the walls all over our house haha. He loves to paint and draw, and now he does photo retouching for a living. :)   Oh, you work at subway right? Maybe that's why you aren't on myspace haha.      Her - yess! im always too busy to get on the computer..but when i find some time i normally get on here for a few mins..lol! but thats soo cool!!!!! so he like paints of canvas's? i normally paint like objects..like little figures and picture frames.. and stuff like that! and i ALSO love to work with photos!!! freakkayy! hahahahaa! but yeah i like taking pictures and messing with editing them..its pretty fun!! then i like doing like scrapbooks..but i can never finish one! hahaha!!      Tyler - Yea he does all of that stuff. One time he took a picture of my brother in several different poses, and put them all on one photo so it looked like we had quadruplets of him! haha. We didn't order the retouched version of the prom pictures either! My dad just did the retouching himself by taking the logo off! I'm not quite sure what he paints on, its just thick paper i guess? Probably canvas. He likes to draw too :)   That reminds me - I have a model car I need to paint haha.   Me and my brother went to subway across from Shanes today and we didn't see you there :( I told the lady "Where's Sarah?" and she said "Sarah?" haha i don't know.   I find it funny that we also have the same music in common too! As I Lay Dying is one of my favorite bands, along with Lamb of God. I like the songs 94 Hours and The sound of Truth.      Her - thats really cool!!! hahahaha! is it like absract pictures he paints or is it like full on picutures..like landscapes or people or stuff..lol! and im not too good at drawing that much tho..thats one of my faults when it comes to art stuff i guess..   and you do model cars? thats pretty neat! how many do you have done?   and nahh..i mostly work night shift at subway..i hate night shift tho..we have to deal with all the moody customers..clean up the store..take out the trash..AnD prep for the morning shift! its CRAZY!   I LoVe allllllll kinds of music!!!! its so wild! 94 hours is awesome tho..and i dont think ive ever heard of The sound of truth..i might just have to go look that up! haha!! Do you like Devil wears prada, or Slipknot, or Underoath???      Tyler - He paints everything! He painting a picture of my mom next to this lake, a picture of this old abandoned house, flowers, and several others!!! He doesn't draw often though, he does sketch group every now and then, but he isn't too much into drawing..   I don't do model cars that often. There is a corvette I bought a few months ago and never really got around to building it. I found it earlier and I was like waaaaaa! How could I forget this?!? I like the exotic cars, like Lamborghini, toyota supra's and stuff like that.   The subway staff looked liked they could have used your help. There were only two of them and there was like 30 customers lol. And there was this pack of girls that looked like they were from softball or something idk, but they were very annoying and people were leaving the store because of them haha.   I love all kinds of music too! There isn't really one type of music that I listen to. I'll listen to anything that has a good beat to it. I listed to mostly heavy metal and electronic/dance music. i LOVE devil wears prada, and I've always like slipknot since they started. I can't really say I like underoath though, I've only heard a few of their songs.   I like just about every band there is because they usually have atleast one song that I like haha.      Do you mind if I text you on the phone? Your profile said you were a big texter :)      Her - uhhh i hate it when like a entire team comes in..it makes the place soo crowded! one time the girls basketball team and the girls soccer team came in at the same time and i was so maddd..i was about to slap somebody! hahaha!   but i have a good mixture of both soft and hard core rock..then some pop and alternative..and hip-hop stuff..   so mostly everything! hahahaa!   and thats not really true..now i dont text as much as i use to bc my phone is always on silent and i can never really get anyones messages on time..   :/ hahaha!      Tyler - Really? Everyone was staring at them and people were walking out! lol! The two people working were telling people not to leave lol. The softball people decided to go eat at McDonald's AFTER they just got eating at subway... jeez. They left the place in a big mess too.   That reminds me.. me, Mark, and Micah are probably going to have a barbecue this weekend, I need to get stuff for that...   Yea, I like mainly everything but the only thing I listen to on a daily basis is alternative and heavy metal. The only music I have a hard time listening to is country.   Well if you you'd like me to text you that will be great. Do you mind if I get
20090309141145AAWyfb3	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to live in school without friends?	no one seem to like me in my new school its highschool freshmen 9 th grade and i am always alone and i feel embarrassed like this because in all my other old schools i went to had friends i cant go to lunch because i hate being seen alone. i feel stressed when i am in school, i feel like a loser, i feel unimportant, i feel that there is something wrong with my me that people dont like. its a public high school like ghettolike. im not a nerd or anything, i know some of you are going to be like join a club im already late for that. what do you think i should do and how to survice high school alone?
20090309125258AAWTRJV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does Facebook ever make you feel like a loser?	I created a Facebook account a couple months ago.  I found a lot of old friends from highschool.  While it was cool to sorta see what they're up to, I noticed that most of my old friends are still friends with one another.  Besides a few times here and there, I haven't talked to them in forever.      Maybe part of it was that I married at 18 and had a baby a year after.  While I shouldn't care, it bugs me that I never maintained any of those friendships.  I liked a lot of them back in the day.

I have been going out with my bf for 3 weeks now and he is wayyyyy different from normal guys. he watched chick flicks, has a lot of female friends, doesnt care about looks, and is super sweet. Well i have had a best friend since 1st grade and we r like sisters. Well every day at lunch my bf sits to my left and my bff sits to my right and there are a bunch of other friends but aren't a part of this question. Well, today my bf wanted to tell me something important that only i could know about. And he said i cant tell my bff. So i said ok fine. So my bff wanted to know wat it was so she was like "She will just tell me anyway, you do know that," And then it was time for us to leave lunch so we started walking and my bf found one of his friends. SO me and my bff were walkin to class and then my bf came back beside me. And he told me he was going to tell me the important thing right now. So i said ok. And then my bff was like "Tell me tell me tell me!" and then my bf shoved her and then she slapped him and then so on and so on. then a teacher saw him shove her and he got yelled at. But they are always yelling at eachother and he maily starts it by saying something rude about her when she isnt doing anything. She hates him caz he is really annoying to everybody, thats just who he is, he annoys everyone. And he hates her because he thinks she is a bad influence on me....idk? But please help me I dont know what to do. My bff now has a ton of bruises and she REALLY hates him even more then she did. They are always doing this and i dont know how to stop it or to make them be nice to eachother. I told them to have a fresh start and then my bf just antagonizes again. He is always doing this and its mainly his fault.How do i stop their fighting? Help!

20090309160247AABcnUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean? nothing right? Over 21 please. kinda long. your advice would be nice :)?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.   Also, my friends are in a couple of his classes and they keep saying he looks really sad or somethings just on his mind.   oh, and no he did not cheat on me haha.      ok, so its been a month and a half after trhe break up. I texted him last last saying sorry i forgot to drop off his laptop and will get a friend to drop it off :)      his reeply was soo cold just    "ok"      i replied and said "by the way, you made an excellent decision. I totally agree with the breakup now:)"      his reply was "ok"      i replied again ( i know i shouldnt)   and said that i didnt think it would be so awkward between us but whatever makes him happy and that this was the last time id be texting him.      his reply was "im just busy"      Why is he being so cold ?? i dont understand. I know he is going through something but he was NEVER mean to me like this at all.   & no, he was not busy at all. How can someone who dated you for 2 years and showed so much affection and care evenn during the breakup period and be like this now??         ok....so Its Monday. And he sent me a text this morning asking if i was at school   i said "yeppers, you?"...but this was 2 hours later as i was in a lecture at the time.   He replied "too late..i needed to borrow your calculator :p "      i replied "ok"      wtf is his problem? I am just leaving this. he needs to figure his stuff out right?

20090309121608AAK1uNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this okay in a relationship?	me and my boyfriend are both 16.we've been together for 5 months, the first couple months we talked allot about like movies and shows and crazy random stuff. but now we still talk its just not as much and it seems very awkward and different from before. now this is just (what i think) .also, he seems to talk Way more with his friends but he does still talk to me and cuddles but he seems to be closer with his friends than me and him, is this wrong? is it normal to not have so much to say further down the relationship even if its not about the person just about like shows  movies and other stuff.
20090309160325AA2fMNl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love her and I can't stand it.?	I've been in love with my best friends girlfriend since long before they were going out.  Now that they are going out I can't stand it.  I never asked her out because me and her became very close friends and I didn't know how she felt about me.  My emotions were all confused during that time.  I love this girl and can't stand hearing about her and my best friend.  She then told me one day (when they were going out) that she really likes me and always did, but gave up when I decided to go out with someone else.  I can't stand it, I'm depressed and don't know what to do.  It's bad, but I would never ever want to hurt my best friend.  She is still okay with kissing him and stuff even though she told me that she loved me and that she would have gone out with me if I would have asked and would rather be going out with me.  We can't hurt my friend, I know I just can't.  Now I don't know what to do, should I just forget about it and find someone else?  I love her and can't stand it, stress is getting to me and I will just sit in school and not think of anything else.  I'm going to be graduating high school soon.  Please Help! I know this is a complicated situation, but what should I do.  Again, I couldn't stand hurting my best friend.
20090309133334AAJWjQK	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about this?	Well, my best friend is mad at me. See, I kind of liked this guy for a couple months and didn't tell her. However, I DID tell another friend who I've only known for about a year and another I've known for three years, whereas I've known her for five. The reason I told them is because I'm just closer to them; I feel as though I've lost touch with the best friend.       So my question to you is: is she right to be mad?   And my second: what should I do to fix this?

20090309124522AAIKFwb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help with this shy girl 10 easy points?	im saying everything without changing anything, coz im really confused of the situation.      so this girl and i usually see each other for 5 mins a week just when we walk from our lockers to the caf or b4 going home, we dont really see each other that long and not everyday. at first i thought she liked me too and so evn though im really shy i tried to be closer to her. i talked to her everytime i had the chance, but the thing is she never starts the conversations with me, so i always have to go to her to talk to her. and so i knew she was at the library during break with her bestfriend. so i said one time if i could go with them. were both really shy and so when i got to the library we didnt really have a steady flow of conversation( also because we were both trying to do our homework) but we did talk, had a few laughs but it wasnt really that great as i thought it would be, me hanging out with her wasnt really a fail but it kinda is. then after that i see her after school and walked her to the exit, but this time we didnt evn talk, it was awkward i just said hi then walked with her while b4 we usually talk. then today, i didnt go to the library anymore i saw her at the cafeteria then went to the lobrary and i just decided not to go with her. and when i saw her after school today, i said hi as ususal, but she didnt walk with me anymore she just walked away :( i dont know whats happening, we were close b4 i went to the library she talks alot to me when i go to her, but then this time she just left help!!!
20090309152154AAO3oDf	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about her?	Okay, me and my friend have been close for a long time. But now we have another girl in our group who is always trying to steal her for herself. Actually, I shouldn't say that because I do like both of them, but sometimes I feel like they keep me out of stuff. They recently got  into a fight and didn't speak to each other for a week. I was sort of hapy because my friend was spending more time with me, and she told me that she was going to slap her because she was being so mean, and that she never wanted to talk to her again. However, the next day they were all friendly with each other just because the other girl started talking to my friend again. It made me mad because she forgave her right then and there, AFTER she said she was so freaking mad at her. They didn't save me a seat at lunch, or talk to me almost the entire day! What should i do? This is tearing me apart inside and out, I don't want another bfff. Lord knows it's hard enough to find one as good as her. I don't have a problem with the other girl at all, I really like her, but I don't want to be ignored and forgotton.

20090309150221AAYCP6F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Let me tell you my story...i need advice...?	alright, this is another one of those mushy gushy questions that confused, hopeless romantic people like me ask...      2 years ago, i met this guy. i really hit it off with him and naturally began to have feelings for him. i never said anything however because...well... you would have to know him to see how unbelievably amazing he is.... anyways. so i never said anything.       last summer, i moved away, from north carolina to miami. i was excited to go but it hurt to because i was going to have to do a long distance relationship with the guy i was with....       i recently broke up with my boyfriend. The reason being this:      i can honestly say that for the past 2 years, the first guy i mentioned (we'll call him David) has been in the back of my mind. i have never stopped thinking about him, even all throughout my relationship with this other guy... so i broke it off with my boyfriend because i felt horrible and like i was leading him on...      here's the deal: "David" and i have always continued talking. like, we always are online chatting or emailing, etc, just about random things, and we have really gotten very close and gotten to know each other extremely well... he tells me all the time how great and amazing he thinks i am, and how he misses me living there... i suspect he might have feelings for me, but he has acted like this in the past with other girls, only for them to discover it was just mere kindness, not attraction...i dont want to be one of those girls...         i am headed back up there to NC for my spring break which is coming up very quickly (a couple weeks) and David and i have agreed to meet up and hang out.... i strongly feel the need to tell him how i feel but i honestly cant read him.. i have no idea what is going on inside his head.... but some of the things he says to me, i cant really see him saying to anyone else..so i dont know.      should i be brave and make a move, hoping for the best with the risk of looking like a fool....?         trust me... this guy is one in a million. He is that one person in my life that i would immediately drop everything and be with should he reveal to me that he cares for me...

So i met this guy back in jan and lets just say that me and him were both going thru a breakup in which we were both broken up with in november. However his relationship was longer than mine. Anyways me and this guy connected pretty well and so i thought ok lets see where this goes. As we were getting to know each other we talked about the past relationships and he had told me that if his x were to come back he would take her back i was like ok thats understandable you were with her for a long time. As time went by i thought that he was starting to get over his x bc he would be like oh im starting to get over her the more i see u and talk to u the more i care less about her. He would always tell me how much he liked me and how i always made him smile and laugh. The other day he got a phone call from his x they met up and got back together. I wasnt so much hurt bc i put in my mind that he was going to get back with her however i was just confused bc he would be one min i really like u and u give me butterflies and now hes back with his gf. I dont know if he really was intrestd or was confused or what it was.
20090309151347AA9NHjM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need major friend help... I'm Confused!?	Im an 18 year old guy and I have this friend whos a girl that I met on facebook, and we’ve been talking online for months. She gave me her cell number, and wants to hang out JUST AS FRIENDS, but when I ask her to hang out, she keeps coming up with stuff to avoid hanging out. for instance last friday we were gonna hang out but her girlfriend (shes gay) left her for someone else and she wanted to be alone. and then 4 days later her mom lost her job, so she said she couldnt hang out cuz she needed to be with her family cuz she feels bad for her mom. thats a lot to take in 4 days. after telling me that, she blocked me on facebook, so i cant contact her. After finding out she blocked me, i texted her and called her and she ignored them all. my theory is that she just has too much going on, like too much drama and doesnt need me talking to her, asking her to hang out, cuz she said she feels bad when she blows me off like last week with her girlfriend leaving her. I then told her if she doesnt want to hang out with me, then she could just tell me. i've told her this numerous times and she keeps saying that she didnt say that, meaning she would want to hang out. plus she suggested we hang out and promised she'll make up for the time she blew me off last week. i just think she needs space for a little while. since she blocked me, i havent been talking to her, i havent texted her for like four days since she blocked me. i then texted her asking how shes doing and that im sorry for putting pressure on her to hang out... no reply. I'm now going to call her on thursday and if she doesnt answer im going to, on Sunday, go to the mall where she works, which is an hour away from my house, go in the store she works at (journeys), say hi and ask if its cool if we talk on her lunch break. And so i dont sound desperate, I will tell her was at a friends house around here and decided to swing by to run some errands and see how shes doing. does that sound like a good move, and one that she will appreciate/welcome??    thanks! =)=)=)
20090309144831AAUeL3h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to be in love with older women?	- i fell in love with a beautiful mature woman at the school canteen, she's been really nice to me, i heard her say that i'm gorgeous behind my back ;), and i had the best conversations with her. It was my last year at school and now i'm at uni, and she said that i should drop by and visit her and that she'll miss me, maybe she's just being nice and i'm the only one who talks to her. Oh yes i had a nightmare about her that she stopped liking me, then grabbed an axe lol. i was a distraction, as she'd hear my voice then quickly jump to me and serve.      -at work, every time i work i get into a conversation with one of my regulars, typically and older woman, they're really nice and i always crack them up      -i often have women looking for items they can't find, and i find it for them, then they say "thanks" in such a kind way, not like other people when it's its just a simple quick thanks.      -they always have something sweet to say, especially when i'm feeling down, then i feel better.
20090309120740AA1yjuz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I read some disturbing things about a girl I like on facebook, should I believe them?	I really like this girl I'm friends with. We're both Christians and I think she is really an amazing girl.  Well, I was looking through her facebook page, and I saw under friend details for two guys she's friends with, it says "they hooked up and it was pretty much the greatest ever", and "they hooked up and it was pretty good I guess".  I found it really disturbing to read, and if it's true, it really destroys my image of her.  I didn't think she was the type who would ever "hook up" with someone, and on top of it, even post it on facebook and say how good it was! I heard that sometimes people put stuff like this as a joke.  Do you think that is the case?  She's even talked about saving herself for marriage, but even people I know who have had sex with a lot of people were at least in relationships and not just in a "hook up" situation.  Does this inconsistancy point to the fact that it is probably a joke?
20090309133607AA8rU2x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I thought we were going somewhere and she no longer writes me. Why?	I was best friends with this guy. We graduated college and started a business together. I was best man at his wedding.      It all fell apart after I confronted him when I discovered that he was cheating on her. His wife never found out and I never said a word, but he was always afraid that I would.      This happened two years ago. Eventually their relationship fell apart too, and though she never found out about his cheating, she left him on her own terms. He was just a difficult, unhappy person to deal with.      She moved to another country and started emailing me. That's when I found out that they had separated. Through our emails we became closer and gave him my opinion on the guy. I did it a few times, and told her that she was too good for him but I never told her about the cheating.      A year after they separated, her ex husband paid her a visit, hoping to rekindle things. I felt angry and thought he didn't deserve a second chance.        Me and her were becoming more intimate in our emails and I had the feeling that we were going somewhere. I've emailed her a few more times after his visit and I haven't got an answer from her since December. I suspect that he may have badmouthed me she no longer wants to talk to me, but I don't understand why. I'm going crazy thinking why she won't answer my emails.
20090309144833AARrXSN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you guys answer this for me?	i've been with a guy for 14 years and i know for a fact he's a cheater and a lier.He can be the nicest fun guy,but yet such the looser.He see's how much this hurts me but continues to stay out all night and do his guy thing.Says he loves me and spending time with other girls is not a love thing.Well what the f...?How can this guy really love me?I could never cheat on him.But i am saying goodbye.I can't do this any longer.Do you guys out their think he really loves me?What is he doing this for?

20090309151124AApjv7p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong to reject someone?	Is it wrong to reject someone if you dont think you could ever go anywhere with them. or be really attracted to them . I have done it like 3 times and I feel really bad when I have to do it but It seems like all the wrong guys like me. I have noticed that some girls go out with the okay guys(ones that have asked) and end up with the really  good guys. is their some sort of initiation in highschool dating ?

20090309121615AAubJzd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you feel awkward too?	My roommate is very inconsiderate. Early in the semester her boyfriend would be over 24/7 and they were always under the covers together which made me uncomfortable. When I'd ask her if I could "borrow" the room with my boyfriend or friend's she'd make nasty comments and not allow me to use the room or say she was tired      Finally I spoke to her about her boyfriend & her being under the covers and how it made me feel and she "somewhat" stopped doing it.After that they were still constantly over all day they didn't even go to the dining hall to eat.      Finally I sat with her again and talked and tried to see if we could agree on something regarding her boyfriend always being here I.E. (monday, wed.) she can have the room (Tues Thurs) I could have the room to study. Well, she "didn't like that idea."and he continued to come over.      After spring break though....I didn't see much of her or her boyfriend during the day. (He lives down the hall) The only time she came back was when my boyfriend came to my room for the FIRST TIME this year I wrote on the door "Banana" and had a hair tie on the door (figuring it would give her a hint) and she didn't get the hint cause she walked in on us.      She moved her furniture so it's closer to my bed and her light is literally right next to my bed and she now blares her music at 11PM as I'm trying to sleep. She also now every morning at 5PM turns on her light and gets ready for class and I'm unable to fall back asleep. She leaves her light on for 2 hours while she gets ready.      As I am typing this I AM litereally RIGHT next to her bed at my desk and she is under the covers AGAIN with her boyfriend...she had class till 11AM and I left at 11AM I JUST got back....and he HAS no roommate!!! wait, and lives down the hall      Could she be doing this just to irritate me?   or to spite me?   we haven't said much of anything to each other since after break.

Since we're not married, how can I hold her & kiss her, knowing she might lose interest in the future?

20090309124022AAlv8Jj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	URGENT! What should I do? I need suggestions?	Okay, so here's the deal. I like this guy (ha ha, how many problems have started with that!) and, I'm guessing, note, guessing, that he likes me too. We've been out on one date /ish. And yeah, we talk a bit, (but tend not to, because it gets reaallyy awkward) So getting to the point. I have this gig type thing coming up, and I would really really really like him to go. But I don't quite know how to ask him. Should I just go straight up to him and ask him, or would that be to obvious/desperate? Should I ask my friends to ask him, or would that be weird? (as he hardly knows my friends, and suddenly all these random people coming up to him) Or should I just leave it to fate, and hope he buys a ticket. I really don't know what to do guys!! HELP ME!

20090309152214AAHiPbI	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend left her boyfriend??? And i was just wondering?	So my friend just broke up her boyfriend, she said that he kept making comments about have Threesome, and then said he was joking. So she decided to ask him if he is really serious and he said yeah he would like to make love to two girls at once. So she left him      She said it made her uspet knowing that he would want to make love to another girl. Even though she gets to be involved she felt hurt. She said When a guy really loves you and is interested he would never want to add any other girl to his sex life. She think sex is something only two people share when they are in love.       What do you think about that, i always wondering how could any girl let their man they love make Love to any other girl how could they even watch that?    (I know they also had trust issues and always seemed to be arguing, so that isnt the only reason they broke up)   No rude answers thank you   Just want to know how that would make you feel. and Guys how would you feel if your girl wanted to have you and another guy make love to her.

20090309125256AAAfb1g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I talk about it or just end it?	Been with him three months now. Our first dates was one of the most comfortable, one of the nicest I've had. Great guy, great kisser, good person. He was nervous at the beginning (we're only fifteen), he hadn't really ever been with anyone. I made him more comfortable, and we're getting on okay.    Recently though, there has been a slow-down. I don't know whether he's seeing me just for the sake of it, or if he really wants to. He did mention, "I should see you more - "   not the word SHOULD. He's not been mistreating me or anything.    I want someone who wants to be with me, not because they feel obligated to be there, but because they WANT to be there. Does that make sense?    Do you think perhaps he's not taking any action because I tend to be very laid-back? Why would he stay with me if he didn't want to?   We don't really spend a whole lot of time together alone.    May I add he's the one who asked me out.   Is the spark gone, or should I just try to make him see how I feel? How could I do that? What if he doesn't feel the same way, and I create confusion? Am I just being Ms. Paranoid-Pants?   Thanks for reading.

I had two kids b4 I met him and they believe he is their father, he loves them very much and is a good dad. the kids have my last name. Although I want to get married I dont think it would be right for me to get married without him adopting our two kids first. he doesnt feel that legally adopting them is important as long as they know he is there for them and will always be. Am i wrong to feel this way? i would rather not have a different last name then my children.

20090309115537AAlF0dp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend who is my first and only shag wants to reunite a year after he BROKE my heart. What do I do?	He completely lied to me and I believed him fell in love with him and slept with him. He was my first/only.   Then about 7 months after we started dating, a woman he has a baby with calls me and tells me that they are married bla bla bla.   So I broke up with him, I didnt want to be a home wrecker.   He said they wernt married they just had a child together.   The baby was born about 6 or so months before we met.   Then four months later I found out I was pregnant. My family were shocked they went on and on about it for a few days then they calmed down and asked to soeak to him. He efused.   Unfortunately I miscarried about three weeks after finding out I was pregnant.   I was completely devastated. I wanted to die also. I had started making plans and my mom had gotten baby clothes... I had even started picking out the best school for my baby to go to! Anyway he came to see me in hospital but did absolutely nothing for me after that.   He totally blew me off - I know I was just heartbroken and unaproachable for a while but I think he should have risen above it.    With the help of God friends and family I slowly got better and I have just started law school and not meaning to brag but Im looking really good these days. And who should now want to be part of my life and meet formally with my parents and "marry" me? My ex!   He claims to have seen the error of his ways and is sorry that he abandoned me when I needed him the most. He goes out of his way to bbe nice to me and help me out...    I wont lie, I felt a bit of the old love I had for him. But I think it was just familiarity and not real love now and he is the only man I have ever slept with or loved.   Can people change and should I forgive him?

20090309114800AA1ftY1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Trying to find sincerity in this relationship?	I just let my boyfriend move back in in December and the last 3 months from him have been a constant rollercoaster ride. It's like one week he's cool and we get along fine, but then the next 3 weeks he's running the streets with his friends, doesn't want to spend anytime with me and I know deep down in my heart he's cheating.      Two weeks ago we got into it because on his first off day in a while, he chose to go hang with his friends or so he says. When I kept calling him repeatedly he wouldn't answer or return my calls right away. It took him a few hours to call me back and when he did he had an attitude that I was calling him so much. So after we had a fight, he left. He'd come home when I wasn't here but he'd stay out all night for 2 days in a row. He's been working a lot so he's here more and he even took me out last week which is something he hasn't done in a long time. But that was our one good week that we sometimes have.      Now he's pulling his disappearing acts again, staying out with his friends to all hours of the morning and getting calls and texts that he doesn't want to answer or respond to in front of me. How do I find sencerity in this relationship? Am I addicted to drama? I know he's not going to change but I keep hoping that one day the other women will be gone and it'll just be me and him. Any advice?

20090309143426AAHJxOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm a shy guy & I went to a spa last week, what mental image is so hilarious about my story to people?	So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

20090309150953AAuO1TP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused over a boy! Help ?	alright, so i started talking to this guy. (his secret name will be GERM.) He has a girlfriend. We are only 14 so its not like serious dating or anything. but he started talking to me and i had liked his friend(his secret name will be PABLO) before but he didn't like me back. anyways, i started telling Germ how every guy i started to like, they would just continue to disappoint me or hurt me. and he seemed really different. then he told me he liked me and we were soon gonna be more than just friends. Nobody was supposed to know about this though. so me and him decided not to tell anybody until the time was right. but the next day his best friend was hanging out with me and asked to see my phone, so i handed it to him, and i had NO idea he was looking at my texts and he saw everything we talked about and he is friends with Germs girlfriend and he got so mad at Germ and started texting him from his phone asking why he did that while he has a girlfriend. Then Germ said he was just kidding with me. i cried because he said he would never do anything to hurt me. Then i texted him and he said not to text him. the next day i texted him demanding him to talk to me. I asked him why he played me, and he said he didnt play me, he just denied liking me to people, because he didnt want everyone to know yet. I still like him but people say he is a jerk and to forget about him. But somehow i think they are wrong because he is the nicest boy ever to me when we talked. Help? good advice please?

She said that she was going to make me be her ***** and all of the other girls' *****.  And what she meant by that was, she was going to make me grovel at all of their feet.   Then, she said that I would be tied down to the floor, on my back, and be forced to smell her feet and her friends' feet.  She basically told me she was going to make me her personal footslave.      Now my question is, would a girl actually make a guy do this??? I think she may be joking but I don't know.       What would you do?
20090309155129AAFjd4k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a female's perspective and opinion...?	Ok, so just a couple of days ago it was my girlfriend’s b-day.   Long story short, I was unable to see her throughout the entire day until 1:00 am.   The reason was because I had a shift and I didn’t want to get rid of it.  She was already aware of that b/c I told her I wouldn’t give it up.  She’s been upset with me this entire time and I just want everything to be ok again.      Now, I told her how sorry I was and asked how I could make it up; she said that she’d like to make me her little slave by making me get on my knees and kiss her feet and smell them.   She even said that she’d like to walk barefoot and make me like the bottom of her feet (cleaning them with my tongue).      I was a bit thrown off by it but she said that would definitely fix everything since she kind of has a fetish for that sort of thing.      I’m wondering, should I do this? Would any of you girls like your guy or just any guy to do this to you? If so, what else should I expect her to make me do?

20090309131831AAPDgpH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over a guy?	Okay so I had dated this guy for quite some time and we were always on and off. So after a while, we decided to stop going on and off and just stay together. Well, a while later, he cheated on me online...I know it sounds weird, but it's the truth. So I was dumb enough to take him back. I thought that maybe he would change...uh yea right!!! So he cheated on me again...it was WAY more serious than the last time. I was crushed. We broke up and I was miserable. But it gets worse. I was so stupid to take him back...AGAIN!!! I have a weird mind so don't judge me for that. So it really sounded like he was gonna change. Well, he broke up with me a few days later and a little while after that, he went out with one of my friends. I had only taken him back because he said he loved me and missed me and all that crap...I have to admit...I still had feelings for him. So after he dumped me, we haven't gotten back together. I know I cannot go back, but my friend thinks that there will be a time when he'll want me to take him back. She's afraid I'll be stupid...again...and take him back. Well anyway, so ever since the last break up, I've been crushed. It felt like my heart was ripped out and stomped on hundreds of times. I felt awful. He was the first guy I had ever really liked. I've even gone through a depressed stage...I'm kinda emotional too...and I've also cried over it. I doubt he ever really cared about me or even cares how I feel at the moment. It hurts to think that way, but that's just what I do. I tend to overthink things and be very emotional. So the problem is...I cannot get over him. I've tried forgetting him, but one of my friends has the same name and that doesn't help at all. I still talk to him too. I don't know what to do...you got any advice???
20090309132259AAWeuqI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Plz tell me what should happen here?	i know this doesn't fit the category, but i'm posting because my girlfriend told me to. basically, i feel like an idiot because i cheated on her and we've been dating for more than a year (big deal because we're both 18). she just found out and is really hurt, and we're trying to find a way to stay together. she is still really pissed at me, obviously, and we both know i made a mistake and don't wanna break up. i told her i was really sorry and that i would do anything to keep her. she asked me to do some stuff for her, and then asked if i would let her kick me in the balls. i said i didn't know about that, so she told me to write this---and get your opinions. should i take the kick(s)? if so, how many times and how hard should she do it? plz keep in mind how sensitive guys balls are :-/

This kid wanted to fight this another kid for fun (I know like WT*)   He is my friend and he was so stupid he bought a knife for the battle   it was pretty pathetic.   I told him to not do it on school grounds but that retard did it anyways.   He showed the knife to him and that was pretty pathetic too.   I could've even beat that kid up in 5 seconds but I guess he wanted to go guarding. Well I was watching and I ended up holding someone's phone.   Some one snitched on us and we got in trouble. There were lots of witnesses and I was one of them   I'll get suspended if I don't know what to say or lie   Truth is that dean is a BlTCH I hate her.   I get called down there for random reasons.

20090309153806AAyFSK4	Family & Relationships;Friends	I've honestly wrecked everything?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309145625AApYS9L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think we can still work out?	i recently got drunk and made out with a friend of my girlfriends.  We have been dating for two years and live together.  .  I love my girlfriend.  I would never do that sober.  You can think what you want and say alcohol is no excuse and all that, but i really do love her as far as i can tell since it's a tough thing to figure out.  After the incident i kept thinking about the girl and the whole situation and it was driving me crazy.  I love my girlfriend but i thought i liked this girl.  I think i may have a self esteem issue because i look for attention wherever i can get it...and fall for anyone that gives it to me.  anyways a month went by.  and i still hadnt told her.  i didnt think i ever would.  but the other night i got really drunk because i was depressed and started talking to the girl i kissed.  i told her things i didnt really mean like i cared about her and wanted to be with her.  It was all a lust thing i think, its all very confusing to me.  My problem is that i think that i actually believed those things i was saying to her when i was drunk (i understand that i probably have a drinking problem).  So in a drunken moment thinking i wanted to be with this other girl i told my girlfriend what had happened when she called me on her break at work.  she told me to leave and that she would pack all my stuff.  the girl told me i could stay with her that night, so i did.  we ended up having sex.  me still being drunk.  i didnt sleep at all that night.  as i began to sober up the guilt set in.  Any feelings i might of had for the girl were washed away.  All i could think about is my girfriend and all that she had done for me and how much of a dick i am for hurting her like that.  I'm still staying with my girlfriend.  for some reason she dosnt want to kick me out  im sleeping in a seperate room.  I havnt told her about that night.  i just can't.  i don't think i can bear to see the pain it would bring to her.  plus i know there would be absolutly no hope for us ever again.  it took me making this huge mistake to see how much i love my girlfriend.  They say you never know what you have until its gone.  I told the other girl there is no hope for us ever being anything.  an of course i hurt her as well.  I don't mean to be such an ***.  i'm just stupid.  My girlfriend still wants to be around me all the while saying we will never work.  we talked like nothing had happened last night.  she let me sleep on the floor next to her bed cause after 2 years its hard to sleep alone.  i know funny right.  Should i just move on?  try to better myself and leave this poor girl alone?  i'm just so tierd of starting over with new people.  i honestly could see us getting married.  i learned my lesson from all this  it's obvious she still has feeling for me, but she seems so certain that she will never take me back.  she is a very stubborn girl.      tell her and except the pain i deserve and **** my whole life up?  or try to remedy everything?  my brother offered me a place to live in another state.  i don't want to leave everything i know AGAIN (ive moved a lot since my paretns kicked me out a few years ago.)        Anyways...any advice/criticism would be appreciated.  please keep the insults to a minimum cause i already feel about as low as i can.  i understand i have some issues i need to work out.  and i want to fix them so out relationship can work.            Update:  As i was writing this write before i was about to publish it.  she came in and said that she doesn't want me to move and that under certain conditions (no drinking for one) we can try to work things out and be together in the future.  now im just at a loss.  Life sucks.  Do i live a lie?  or do i live in pain without her?

20090309135025AAeoZwK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How tall do you like your guys?	This can be a question for girls who date guys or guys who date guys, and would be interesting to read the feedback. Am just curious. I'm roughly about 5'7''-ish or so myself. Not short but not massively tall either. Kinda average, I guess, though I do often feel quite short compared to other guys. I'm quite comfortable with my height as it is kind of in between. I'm naturally fairly slim so if I was much taller I'd look pretty scrawny, I'm sure.   May seem like a shallow question but the fact is, we do notice attributes such as heights in others, whether it's those we're attracted to or just our friends.

20090309120313AATaWIb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend is the perfect package... And I feel suffocated.?	My girlfriend is perfect. She is beautiful, talented, smart, people-oriented. She wants me to succeed in life so she pushes me to great lengths to connect the dots; succeed with people, build my business, explore my talents, come out of my shell.      But over the last year, all of that good stuff that she wants from me is leaving me feeling suffocated. Logically, I know she is right, and all of the thigns she wants from me are the things I've been telling myself to do forever. But for some reason, I fight her tooth and nail. I feel like I am losing part of myself to succumb to her requests. To admit I'm wrong constantly, and accept her TRUTH.       Any man out there would want her, and she is constantly pursued by other men (whom she doesn't give the time of day). She's loyal.      What is wrong with me? How do I change my perspective?

I know of a lady who was a beauty queen in her college days, infact she is a beauty. but her husband cheated on her with a "not so beautiful" lady with a "banging" body.

20090309154722AAHjwcL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating a man 22 years older, his wife died 3 yrs ago and he still hasn't moved any of her things out?	He's twenty something years older than me, 66 and his wife died three years ago, and he hasn't moved anything in his house, her clothes jewery, nothing, it's like she still is alive.  We have been dating for a year and it is really getting to me to the point I can't go to his house because it's like she still exist.  He says he keeps it like that because of his son, he's 34 or 35 and lives in another state, and never comes home but once a year, and doesn't want the house, the part of town the house is is getting bad, dangerous in fact, yet though he wants to marry me, I can't move into that house.  If he won't move her things out, and makes no attempt to put her things away or give them to his son, and I wouldn't live in that neighborhood, because of the danger, yet he says if we married he would move, but he does nothing to attempt to show me he's trying to move, nothing.  I've asked him to at least put her jewery away, her purfume, ect away, so I don't feel like I'm going into her house, yet he won't do it, because he says it's for his son, which like I said, never comes home.  Even his brother, sister and family think he needs to sell the house, and move on, and love me to death, but it's gotten to the point I just get him to come to my house.  Although I'm not ready for marraige yet, and love him, he's really clingy, wants to be with me 24/7, and I've been divorced 19 yrs and have children in college away, and raised them on my own, so I'm very independent, and I like my space, and I don't want someone around me 24/7 and told him, I just don't think if we married it would'nt work, because I need my space.  It's so bad, he can have something going on, and he won't do it, because he says he doesn't want to stay away from me.  I have to say my kids are coming in town for the night and spending the night just so I can have a breather, but that's not the problem now, I'm wondering, we've been dating a year, his house is like a shrine to his dead wife, he says he's over her, but refuses to change his house, and then he tells me if he ever lost me, he couldn't go on, he would die, which I told him, you would go on, but you arn't going to lose me, you just need to look ahead and go on with your life, and I've gone to counselors, which he thinks are quacks and think they tell me what to do, which they don't they are really good ones, and I don't go just for him, I rarely talk about him, I go for me, because I was in a very abused relationship 19 yrs ago, had a terrible car accident which I almost died, post-tramadic symdrome, been raped twice when I was in my twenties ect, and been going though they say I'm fine now, I just feel better going, since I've been going all these years and they know me, and think it would do him good, he just refuses to go.  My concern is, am I allowing him to manipulate me, with this I can't live without you, blah blah blah, and it goes beyond that, where it's gotten to the point I don't want to make love with him anymore, and I caught him in lies before, not cheating but lies, small ones to the point I think, he watches my house, maybe has tapped my phone, ect, which creeps me out, when I see him around my house, he says he was just in the neighborhood which I know isn't true.  I'm 45, but look in my thirties and he knows in my line of work I meet alot of men, and is always saying I know guys hit on you all the time, and I'm like what, I don't pay attention, which I don't.  He's very sweet, kind, gentle, if you didn't know better you would even think he's gay, but I know he's not, he's that sweet and kind and does things for me out of the blue which is so sweet, but I know from him and his brother I've found they used to have a very devious, wild side, and would resort to tapping the phone and such, which I use my cell now when I need to talk to my friend about him.  I'm getting off the main subject though, which I guess there are alot of things going on, and the more I date him, I love him, but just not in love, and don't know maybe one day, that will happen with the way he treats me so good, if we could just get beyond the wife deal, and the smothering thing.  I'm not trying to sound cold or mean, everyone would tell you I'm the sweetest person in the world, I volunteer, and help homeless ect, plus work and pay for my daughters to go to college when I'm not even supposed to be working with all that's happened to me physically from my car accident years ago, but had no other choice and they work two jobs so they do do their part, and they are going to be dr.s, but if you looked at me, you wouldln't be able to tell, because it's all inernal, plus I'm deaf.  Someone please give me advise on my relationship.  It's a year, and I'm still young and attractive and not to sound vain, get offers everyday for dates, but don't act upon them as I do love him, I'm just not in love, and he is sooo sweet and kind, I just don't like little lies, and don't like him saying he's doing the house bit f

So - I started dating my boyfriend about 3 weeks ago - and so far I get a feeling that he's just very jealous?

There are great sides of him, but some sides that I'm just questioning...him and his ex girlfriend had a very toxic and emotionally abusive relationship and I'm nervous that it's trickling into ours...ah!

20090309120410AAWzvcH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do. details below?	ok so ive been going out with my boyfriend a month now and our relationship is very stable and we have very few problems. we talk all the time but not usually over the phone because its always easier to text. so i see him at school and he almost doesn't talk to me at all when we're walking. also in class he goes off with his friends and hardly acknowledges me  at all. i usually go over to talk to him but he will never say anthing unless i do or we're texting. he pretends like were just friends unless we're texting. i tried talking to him once about it and he said he just doesn't want to say the wrong thing. and i told him to be himself because i like him for who he is. and later i asked him again...today and didn't know what i was talking about.....so should all this be happening because it hasn't happend with past relationships and it really really bothers me and i don't know if thats just him...or hes a jerk or whatever but someone please give me advice
20090309120619AAcXCLM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	ok so there is this really shy girl who i never spoke a word too in my class but she starting talking to me. I can tell from the non verbal communication and how I always catch her stairing at me, she likes me however she has a boyfriend back home. One day I told her that I thought she liked me and I like her too but i'm confused cause she had a b/f. After that she said she felt awkward, so why is this awkward and could she be embarrassed? All I did was ask her a question cause i was confused.
20090309120813AA5FYUG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the most sensitive way to tell my gf I will be less physically attracted to her if she shaves her head?	OK, so I love my girlfriend a lot. She is an amazingly beautiful person inside and out. She is very very physically attractive and I Find her very sexy. The problem is, she now wants to shave her head completely bald. I would never dump her b/c of something like this, and of course I'll still love her, but that is a major turn off physically for me. This is because when I was little my mom got very bad cancer and had chemo and was also bald, except it wasn't by choice. because of this women with shaved heads  turn me off sexually, and I equate a lot of bad memories with it, as well as it would remind me of my mom, which is also not good in this context. Even if Shakira or Beyonce shaved their heads ( and I think my gf is just as beautiful) I still wouldn't go for it. Now, it's her hair and her life, she can do whatever she wants and I'll support her, but I know because of the mom issues and stuff I would not be able to be into sex or making out with her, and when I don't " rise to the occasion" she will ask why, and I don't know how to tell her without sounding like a total asshole. What should I do?
20090309121155AAY1TPp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend cut his hair and I can't help but see him differently. Help!?	My boyfriend of one year has always had long, georgeous hair and that's how I know him... But he thought cutting his hair would help him land a job in an interview.  He already has a job and his hair looks fine pulled back...      Last night, he let his mom hack away at his hair and if he had acne, he'd look like one of the nerdy kids no one liked at my middle school... or, if he wore the right clothes, a total asshole.  I guess it's not so bad, and it IS shallow of me to think this way, but he just isn't as attractive as he used to be.      And yes, this will take a major toll on our sex life.  I don't think I can ever take him seriously enough to have sex anymore.  It's such a turn-off, especially considering that his hair was one of his biggest turn-ons.  He just looks so different it feels like he's a total stranger!!  I don't have sex with strangers.      Does anyone think this will go away?  Is there anything I can do to make myself not be so shallow like this?  Like a different way to think? I know it's not break-up worthy, but what do I say when he wants to have sex and I just can't do it...  The truth?  Which would be worse: avoiding it or telling the truth?

20090309123243AAud4Wf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will he fall out of love with me?	I've been getting these images of my ex-boyfriend in my head these days. He'd walk out of my life and come back saying he missed me. And I would take him back simply because I was madly in love with him. This happen thrice in that whole year. He'd often say things like "Oh, I love you but I'm not in love with you." The last time he walked out on me, he said that he had fallen out of love with me.       Right now, I'm with someone really wonderful. I've known him since 2005 and he was my go-to guy when I had problems. 3 months ago, he told me that he's been crazy about me for a long long time and that he wanted to be with me. I've come to realize after these few months that I love this guy. I know I do. We connect on a really spiritual level. Things are great. However, ever since I've been getting these images of my ex in my head, I'm distressed. Does it mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend? Oh also, I'm really careful about what I say to my boyfriend - probably because I'm paranoid that he could fall out of love with me too.
20090309123517AAivqnF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it bad if all your friends are mainly guys?	ever since i was young, i have made friends with boys easier than girls.  i began to figure out that maybe it was because i was raised by my dad and i seen things differently.  i do have some friends that are girls, but i don't hang out with them as much as my guy friends.  is that a bad thing?  i would like to try to make other friends that are girls, but some girls seem to act better than everybody else, and that is what i dislike in a person for them to be that way.  i'm not trying to be judgemental of them. advice please.

20090309124534AAVm9M3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So my boyfriend confessed he has cheated on me.?	My boyfriend( of 1 1/2) just told me that the first month we were going out he had cheated on me twice. He said the he made out with one girl and the other girl gave him oral sex. He also lied about his previous sexual relationships. He had only told me that he had slept with one girl, but infact he's slept with 3 in total. The reason he gave me that why he had never told me any of this is because he didn't want me to look or think of him badly(dumb right?) and that the only reason he's telling me right now that he had cheated on me is because he didn't want to keep lieing to me. He keeps saying that the reason he cheated on me was because he was super drunk and that he regrets doing it. He's never cheated on my again...and he's always with me it's just that I can't get over the fact that he did it. He keeps reminding me that it was the first month we were going out but he still did it. The month doesn't really change that fact. I don't know.. I'm the only girl he's ever said 'I love you' to. He doesn't even tell his family that. What's your guy's opinion on the situation?Why in the hell do guys cheat in the first place and say they didn't mean anything...is that really true? Girls? Guys?   Thanks.   Oh and we're both 20 years old, if that helps.
20090309124640AA65WAB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should i do, will he ever stop annoying me?	I am 15 years old and i live with my dad as my mum isnt around. It is only me and him now as i used to live with my great aunt as he has always been to busy t look after me. But my great aunt died 7 months ago and i now live with my dad permanently. He is always been good to me money wise. He owns several business which i will inherit as he has told me so. But i have been living with him for 7 months and since i moved in he is always annoying and tormenting me. I have been arriving in late a few times and he has told me not to be late ortherwise he is going to tan my backside, i have said to him i'm sorry for being late and that he cant abuse me. But i've arrived in late several times and the first time which i arrived in about 1am and i was meant to be in for 10.30pm, he said he was giving me a warning, but i never thought he would ever hurt me. But he put me over his knee and he pulled my trousers and boxers off and bent me over the side of my bed and he spanked me about 20 times. My dad thinks he is a joker, i admit that we are close but i can never really have a serious chat with him. He always tries to torment me, when we went camping he also used his belt on my backside again as he said i was being smart and i wouldn't help him put the tent up. Even when i go to football training, he stands and watches and he shouts " your a r s e cheeks will be burning hot if you dont score a goal soon". While he is saying this all the other dads who come to watch their sons all shake his hand and they think he is funny. I have also been in shops when he is flirting with the women at the shop desks and he shouts at me infront o all the people in the shop move your a r s e small balls. If have also tried speaking to him that he is a control freak but if i argue with him he just trys to humiliate me as he thinks he is in control of me. At the end of the day i ove him and he loves me, but he is just trying to impress his friends as he always humiliates me infront of them. I also had a party on saturday as i thought he wouldnt be home all night as he usually goes out on a saturday and wont come back but i had a party and he came back and he asked me what was going on and then when i approached him he pushed my head in between his legs and pulled the back of my boxers up infront of everyone. I have now been grounded for 5 weeks as i was drinking at the party and now everyone in my school has videos of him pulling the back of my boxers up and they are all laughing at me. He also used his belt on me for about 40 times that night. He says i cant do what i like, but he is trying to control me and he loves winding me up and i feel as if he gets real satisfaction when he uses his belt on me. there is times we are ok, but he likes to annoy me sometimes. He also wants me to concentrate on football all the time. I'm actually quite good, but he wants me to get better every match i play. I have also tried telling him im too old to be spanked, but he doesnt listen. What am i going to do???

Well, my friend just found out that her boyfriend is cheating on her and she is currently still with him. She doesn't want to break up with him, but wants to still be with him. I am currently trying to calm her down. She wants to get revenge on the girl who he is cheating with by sending an e-mail to everyone in the girl's work place that she did this. The girl who cheated with the boyfriend, knew that he has a girlfriend. My friend wants me to help her write the e-mail and I feel that she shouldn't write it and don't want to be involved. But there is also the possibility that I am not supporting my friend when she needs me. What would you do?     Thank you so much to all who answer!

20090309135322AA1CbMR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I choose between two amazing guys?	I know this question is long but i really need help. I will love you forever if you take the time to read it, think, and try and help. I really really would because i don't really want to talk to any of my friends about it. I know i shouldn't bottle it up and i should trust my friends but saying out loud will make me feel one hundred times worse.  So i have had a boyfriend for six months and i'm crazy about him and he is amazing and sweet and funny but there's something kind of missing. i think it's that we didn't start as friends. We met and he asked me for my number and he pretty much just became my boyfriend. And at my age (14) where a lot of stuff is really confusing, i want to have a boyfriend who i can talk to about anything and have tons of fun with and who is first and foremost, my best friend. of course i'm not looking for a totally serious relationship right now, just a fun, trusting one. Theres this guy at my church named johnson and i've liked him since i was little. we kinda weren't exactly friends for a while (meaning we just didn't talk a lot) but recently, we started talking more and more, at church and on facebook. he's really and geeky (i like geeky :) and super nice and he makes me laugh and i make him laugh and yesterday at church we kept looking at each other and we laughed a lot in sunday school and my knees started to shake every time i thought about him. and i feel like an awful awful person because i like this guy thats not my boyfriend and i've cried over it a lot which makes me feel worse because i wish i would just do something about it but i don't know what i want. i feel like i don't deserve either one of them because i'm such a terrible person!! ugh. it's just...   johnson brings out the best in me and we have so much fun which is really important to me and we laugh a lot together. but mark (my boyfriend) makes me happy and respects me and just wants to make me happy. which makes me feel even worse because i so DO NOT want to hurt him. he's just so amazing...   but so is johnson. i try not to look at johnson or flirt with him at all and really we don't flirt...  we just have fun. but it's so hard when you have this kind of connection with someone. blarg. i kind of only know mark as a boyfriend and not as a person. but i was hanging out with mark yesterday and he was so happy and smiley and he kept kissing me and then breaking out in a grin and telling me "i love you. you're amazing." and i really do love him but i feel like he doesn't really know me and sometimes i'm just a different person around him and i HATE IT! how can he really be in love with me if he doesn't know more about who i am. Arg. i'm crying again. i feel so terrible!!! i don't want to hurt mark at all but i want to tell johnson all this and i don't really want to tell mark. well i do...   the thought of telling mark is just way scarier than the thought of telling johnson. is this a totally bad sign for mark and i trusting each other more than we do or just more of me NOT WANTING TO HURT HIM? sometimes i when i'm with mark i just want to be with johnson. isn't that terrible? but sometimes i'm perfectly happy to just be with mark. i'm so awful! uuugh. it's just that...   i'm loud and kind of slow in the head and i run around screaming with my friends. thats how i have fun. being my loud obnoxious really weird self. and johnson knows the weirdo me better than mark does even though mark and i have been hanging out for six months and johnson and i see each other about three times every two weeks. mark is always telling me how much he loves me and how he would do anything for me...  and for the past week, which is how long i've been thinking about johnson, all the stuff he says just makes me want to cry. AAAARGH! i'm so terrible!! mark was acting kind of weird the other night so i asked him what was wrong and he said "i just have a lot on my mind lately" and i asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he said no...   this wouldn't really bother me if he told me other things...   or really of i just felt like we could talk about anything without judgment or weirdness. ahhhh. i'm crying so hard because i really do care about mark and i think that if we break up we're just plain over. we go to different schools we have different friends and he doesn't go to my church so i think theres pretty much zero chance of us just being friends because why would he want to hang out with his ex girlfriend if you guys never really had just a friend relationship? and what of i break up with mark for johnson? will that create a habit of me just leaving guys when another one comes alone? is it cause i've liked johnson for a really long time as just a friend and i've only ever known mark as a boyfriend? am i being a horrible person or am i just forteen and confused about dating and really have no idea what falling completely, madly, head over heels in love is like? i've tried to ignore my feelings for johnson but i can't and i've trie

He says he loves me all the time.  He is affectionate when we are together.  But he doesn't like to spend his free time with me.  I don't understand.  I tell him that he does this and he says it isn't true.  He told me he loves me only 5 days after we got together.  I've left him 3 times because he avoids being alone with me unless for sex, of course.  If we are going to do something together he will invite a friend along without asking me.  I don't think he wants a USA passport because he is not keen on moving to America.  He says he wants to have a baby with me.   He was raised in the Malatya area but I don't know if that matters.  He's very sweet, passionate, and he cooks!  His English is not so good--could that be it?  I'm trying to learn Turkish but it has been slow going.   I'm totally confused.  Can someone help me?

20090309142608AAFuaFh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex who is now also a best friend? Help!?	Right well this is like the first person I have really really truly loved instead of just infatuation/lust etc. And well we broke up about two months ago. I'm finding it really hard to move on as I talk to her everyday.       This is affecting me negatively because she's the one who broke up with me. I used to be a confident guy and I'm feeling a lot less sure about myself. Also, I just find it so hard to flirt or be interested in any girl now.   The thing is I also know it is impossible to get back together with her, and I don't want to either.      But I can't move on either, it's really difficult because we are close friends and we talk to each other everyday, we see each other at least twice a week or more in the stuff we both happen to do.       How do I move on?

20090309142824AASdO3w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've broken his heart. What can I do?	I've really broken his heart and I have no idea what to do. I'll explain what happened. I had been going out with this guy for a few weeks and I really enjoyed his company. But as time went on like when he tried to kiss me and stuff I knew I didn't want it. I really loved him, but more like a brother than a boyfriend. As time went on I kept telling myself that things would get better, but I knew I was just avoiding talking to him about it. It got to the point where I would make excuses every single time that he asked to do something with me. I was in pain, and I knew I couldn't speak to him without crying. When he texted me, and put love you xxx ect. I was angry at him, I broke my phone several times by throwing it about in anger. I even started self harming because I felt alot better afterwards. I nearly started screaming down the phone because he said I love you. I knew that I would never be able to say it back to him. I punched the wall and broke my hand, because of it. On new years eve, everything got spilled out. After copious amonts of alcohol. I told my best friend everything. She decided for me that I was going to end it before I caused myself anymore pain. But still I kept avoiding it. I kept saying just one more chance. But about 10chances later I finally plucked up the courage to tell him. I let him down as easily as I could. It took me about an hour to finally get to the point, I forced myself not. To cry, but I did manage to make my hands bleed as I was clenching my fists so tightly. I couldn't even look at his face. I wouldn't. But afterwards I felt even worse. A few weeks ago, this other guy asked me out whom I am totally and irrecovbly in love with him. But I still feel guilty about my ex. I have stopped punishing myself physically but I can't stop thinking how I broke his heart. He cry over me everyday. And there isn't a time where hasn't loved me. And me getting a new boyfriend has even more destoryed him. What can I do about this? I feel so guilty,
20090309143227AAVwstF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or is just messing with my feelings?	i like this guy in school i've never talked to him in person but i decided to talk to him on myspace. at first i asked him if he liked me because he brought up about how last year i liked him and he said that he doesn't know me enough to like me, so then i asked him if we could be friends and then something else. he said he would be my friend but has a son with someone already and i didn't get upset i actually asked how old is son was but then he told me that he was just kidding about having a son.and so then i asked him why he lied and was he into me and he said that he was kidding and doesn't know me to be into me. i've notice that when we started talking he would write on his mood saying "i want you in my life" and "i'm crushing on you" i asked him who he was crushing on and he said i'm not going to say. now when i was trying to talk to him about other things his respond would be short.so now i think he's not interested in talking to me so i asked him if he likes talking to me and he said "i guess so" and when i asked what do you mean you guess so? and he wrote this rude replied saying " Exactly what I said I suppose so" . o and another thing i asked him why do you keep looking at me because he stares at me whenever he sees me and he just said that he looks at random people which i know for a fact that he looks at me. what is he really feeling why does he put "i'm crushing on you" or "i want you in my life" if he doesn't know me well enough and doesn't seem like he wants to?      would he like it better if we were talking in person???

20090309145228AA5Jzya	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I really look younger than 21?	Alright, I have always been told that young girls (13-16) check me out all the time, even though since I'm almost 21 go for 18+. I mean, I actually have people who walk with me tell me this. Also, younger girls seem to smile at me, which is nice and I appreciate it, but obviously I'm not into younger girls. I would much rarther the 18+ girls smile at me.      Anyway, I even had a security guard one time when I was 20, say he thought I was 15.      My pics are:       http://adam.250free.com/l_383ab259f4c88c...    and    http://adam.250free.com/l_0d88f5c4b6c5f7...       Both pics would have just been last year.      My question is, if I do actually look younger, even though this may attract younger girls, does it actually hurt when it comes to older girls? Like in college, girls sometimes turn me down saying they want an older guy and I look kinda young. LoL. I mean, I want people who walk with me to tell me how that 20 year old girl looked at me not that 15 or whatever girl, LoL.
20090309145409AAKYwuq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Age 16, and not one "proper" relationship!?	I know there must be hundreds of requests like this on here, but...      I'm 16, just about to take my GCSE's, and have yet to have a proper relationship with a girl.      I personally think that a working ethos has been put into me by my parents, and kinda has gone into overdrive, I care too much about my schoolwork, and my social life has suffered! In School, I have female friends, but dont think of them as girlfriends if i was to ask one of them out!      Outside of school I do alot of volunteer work, and dont socialise with anybody my own age who is female...I'm just generally unsure where to go to find a girlfriend, or just to wait until I go to University.

20090309154855AA8c3h8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it slutty for a girl to let a guy touch her breasts?	ok my girlfriend is uncomfortable with me touching her breast. I do not constantly try to touch them, in fact I respect her decision so I don't without her permission. Now the problem is that I feel like she should at some point be ok with it. I mean if we end up staying together a year I think It shouldn't really be a big deal, I mean I am not asking to have sex, but she says she won't even then and for some reason I can't let it go every time I kid around about it and she says no it frustrates me and I keep bugging her about it. I wish I could get over it, but it is just that I am ok with wait a while but not never or till marriage. I don't see why she is so uncomfortable about it or why I can't just let it alone and I keep making her feel pressured which either makes her sad or angry at me. I am not meaning to do but am.       Plz don't say I just want her for her body. It is not that I love to talk to her and I always look forward to seeing her.      any advice
20090309154957AAZFxd3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help with a girlfriend problem?	Hey guys and gals,      I have been going out with my girlfriend for about five months now and everything seems to have been going smoothly till this weekend.  We are both seniors and we went to a high school party where we both had a great time.  During the party I confronted her because she left me and I couldn't find her for about 10 minutes.  I later found her and one of my guy friends in the bathroom so I asked her if they were doing anything and she replayed no.  My friend also ensured me that nothing had happened.  I believe them.  After I had asked my girlfriend about it though she hasn't been the same to me.  She is awkward around me in school and doesn't feel like texting me.        I was thinking about giving her some time and some space to settle down a bit because I think she is just upset with me not trusting her or something.      I do know for sure that nothing happened because the door was open and many people were around and they all ensure me that nothing happened.        What do you guys think, what should I do?    Do you think that she could just be upset with me for confronting her about it?      Thank you guys very much!      P.S. I love her...a lot

Then I talked bad aabout him to my friends because I didn't want them to go for him and I was just really upset.  Now he's mad at me and won't even talk to me and likes another girl.  I at least wanna be his friend and try to win him back, so how would you like a girl to apolagize?  Andd what would you want a girl to do to win you back?  I really need a guys help, but girls are okay, too.      I told him that we shouldn't talk for a while because it might give him time to think who he really likes and it will stop us from fighting.  Did  I do the right thing?  Also, I know this probably sounds cheesy and stuff but I was thinking about writing him a letter and sending it to him instead of just handing it to him.  Good idea!?  Guys, got any other good ideas?  Oh, and we went out for a little over a year, btww.

Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave.       *I was at my bustop one day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.       Today I passed by her two different times and both times 2 different guys had there arms around her. Then friday i was gettig on the bus with my cuzin and i turned behind me and there she was with one of my friends but I kept seeing her looking at me by the reflection of the window. Then on the bus she was talking to my friend the whole bus ride but she would keep looking at me?? So does she like me?      im thinking she doesn't since she hangs out with alot of guys.Plus recently I see this guy talking to her alot on her facebook so im thinking somethings gonna happen between them.
20090309164244AA1wN3V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why the heck would a guy try to make you jelous when they broke up with you?	My ex is so confusing! He says one thing, does another. Tries to make me jelous when I dont even give a crap about his gf...so why does he still try?   He broke up with me I didnt break up with him...
20090309170414AARS8d1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would a guy flirt with a girl he doesn't like or wouldn't be more than just friends with?	This guy is driving me crazy. We talk every day, he usually starts the conversations, and we flirt a lot.       He says that he isn't a very smiley person but he told me one night that he likes talking to me and that he's been smiling a lot more lately. He told me he didn't like phones so I don't call him much, but now he says he doesn't mind them and things like that.      He jokes around a lot, so I know he might just flirt with me because he knows we're comfortable enough with each other where I won't take it the wrong way. I don't know any of his friends so I don't know if he likes anyone (he never talks about girls) and I don't know how he acts around them.      Anyone have an answer for me?       Just a side note: He moved away a few years back, so we hardly are able to see each other so it's usually through phone or IM, so the flirting isn't the touchy kind.
20090309165348AATzea1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a woman orgasm off of shared sexual energy alone?	I mean  just purely off of sexual energy.  Sometimes, I may pick up vibes from girls and if I feel her energy and she feels mine, sometimes we'll raise the sexual energy.  I notice other people doing this too.  No physical touching at all and perfect strangers.        I was sitting at a computer in a library doing my homework and there was an attractive looking girl sitting about 5 feet away from me.  We both picked up on eachother and the feelings and sensations kept on rising.  Usually at somepoint, the feeling will subside or if a person isnt comfortable enough, they kinda of fizzle off, but this girls energy kept rising, and rising, well past alot of other girls I have felt.        By the time the whole experience was over, felt like about 5-7 minutes, I picked up a climax sensation on her part.  Ihonestly think if we would have been having sex that her energy would have been equivilant to an orgasm.      I also had alot going on with the chakra ( i think its called the base chakra) around pelvis region.        Any experiences that you guys want to share, because I dont know where I would look on the internet.      Thanks

20090309164359AAvtpLh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to know if a girl is interested in you?	If you are single and shes single. Youre a guy a dont know how she feels about you. You both are friends already and have been hanging out before although ofcourse nothing meaningful. Tell me.       Give me all the hints possible that indicates she is interested in you.   All the physical signals. Touch.   The things they say.    The spin they do (as in tricks, mind games, manipulation and hidden messages and hidden interrogation)    any other signals that says shes ready.
20090309165222AAeVyQN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ughh...The girl actually likes me backk...?	I love to indulge my eyes in eye candy. Well this girl that I been staring at is hot and everything likes me back and shows signs about it. I kind of want her but not too much...      The thing is. I'm in high school. Relationships are such a waste of time. I kinda don't want to have a relationship. But I been giving signs to this girl that I really like her. So I really don't know what I am doing and what to do.
20090309163246AAMc0RC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to make  people stop hating me?	Ok this is what happened, I found a test and all the answers to. i then sent this test to a bunch of people on myspace. The next day, I got caught by a snitch who snitched me out, becasue he found out that I sent it. I got detention, then the people who looked at the answers started to get detention. Right now it is like 25-30 people. No one is talking to me and people yell at me. And I hear girls talking bad stuff behind my back. What can i do to make people stop hating me, I don't think they will ever get over it.
20090309165118AAd34x9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are you attracted to looks or power?	I have noticed I find powerful people attractive, even when they are ugly (if you know what I mean).   Powerful as in having great power/influence in society not strength lol.          :)
20090309162443AAfU5lk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok how can I ask one of my best friends younger sister out?	Ok there's this girl we will call her Lucy for now she is two years younger then me and she went out with brother about 5 years ago. Then they broke up and Lucy became best friends with my younger sister. Anyway Lucy is a party girl so everyone knows her and she is like a best friend to me also because we see her everywhere and she's a really nice. Anyway a little while ago I went to this party and I met the most hottest girl on the planet. I'll call her Mary for now so things don't seem too confusing. My friends don't think much of Mary but Mary is soooo hooot and me and her just clicked. I mean we got along great and ever since I seen her at that party I can't stop thinking about her. I love the way she does her hair. I like what she wears, her smell and she has the sweetest personality on earth. I mean Mary really is something. Only problem is Mary is Lucys younger sister (Mary is 3 years younger then me). I've been friends with Lucy for so long I'll feel I'd only be betraying her by asking Mary out but I've never met a more gorguos looking girl and I've never met anyone who I get along with that great. Now everytime I drop by Lucy's place I see Mary walking around in these short shorts and well basically you get the picture. So what do I do?> Betray my best friend Lucy and ask Mary out? I really think Mary likes me too we get along there's like a certain click about her when we were talking. Or should I just not ask out Mary and go on for the rest of my life without the best girl I've ever met and kick myself for the rest of my life? If you agree on me asking her out how? What should I say? What do I do?
20090309163928AAiOPmI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why don't men ever approach me?	I have people in general (but more men than women) who come up to me and tell me that I "look great" or they "like my style", but no man has ever seriously approached me for 5 years. I wear a lot of vintage, dresses, and high heels. I'm a pretty happy person. I walk with my head high in public. I don't do crazy tans, cleavage, day glo makeup. I think I look pretty good most of the time but why no attention. I'm 22, have a university degree, a burgeoning, and so far successful career, I'm 5'6 and wear a US size 6.
20090309163703AAw56nB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE answer?!?!?! He has a hard past but I like him a lot?!?!?!?	Ok, well, about 4 months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've basically become best friends since then, but I've liked him as more than a friend for a while... So this weekend, I finally let him know that I like him as more than a friend, and he said he liked me back... But anyways, he's very emotional, and he's metro... A lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms, and because he's really into fashion and stuff... But I think the reason he's so emotional is because of his past... His parents both got shot in an awful accident when he was very young... And worst, he saw it happen... So he's lived with every family member (But he seemed to keep losing everyone he loved), and he's been in foster care (Still is, but may be adopted.) He's never had a stable home... It's awful, but he's a very strong person, because he's still so positive and everything. He's a really loving person, and very touchy-feely. So today, there was no school, and he came over, and we went for a walk, and he kissed me. <3 lol But the thing is, my mom doesn't know we're dating yet... She loves Nathaniel... but that's with him being just my friend... She's said that having a relationship with someone like him isn't good, because they come with so much "baggage," and such a hard past, that the emotions and everything make the relationship too hard and almost impossible to keep going... But Nathaniel doesn't seem like the kind of person who would let his emotions from what happened get in the way... I honestly think that us being together, either as friends, or dating, is good for him because... well, he just needs someone to love him... And I want to be that person... What if my mom won't let me date him, though? I really, really like him, and I'm SO happy that we told each other how we feel... what should I do?!?! What do you think??      He's a junior and I'm a sophomore.

20090309161811AAhbXIc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this kid wanna be more than friends?	me and this kid have been really good friends for about three years now and my other friends have always said he had a thing for me.      hes always been a little flirty and has asked me for stuff (my water bottle, gum, money, etc.)      but this time its a little different. he steals stuff off of my desk and throws it on the floor, he destroyed my calculator like COMPLETELY, and broke my pencil in half.      does this kid have anger problems or is he sending me a message?
20090309170033AAyPKnU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am crazy about this man. HELP?	can't eat, I can't sleep!!! He's my partner in work and I often go to his home to work with him. He has someone, but I don't know if she's his wife or girlfriend. I am confused - if she's his wife, then why do we chat often via skype till late (in this case - she should be there in this time) and even once we chatted in 5.30 AM (he woke up after he'd been fallen asleep in front of TV)? If she's not his wife, then why does she call him often to make something for dinner? Also she's not in home during the day... I really know nothing about her and I feel uneasy to ask him about his family. Last time, after we finished work, I said that I will take a taxi to go home, because I don't feel well. He suggested to drive me home with his car. His woman called and he told her that he's going to the shop to buy something and he winked at me (he gave me a sign to don't speak).    I know he has a kid.   He'd been taken me to cafes a couple of times but just as friends, I guess (one time we met in the evening and we were in a cafe and drank alcohol (a little).   So,this is the situation. Any opinion?
20090309164416AAO53xe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GF broke up with me very confused?	My gf and I had dated for about 3 months until the other day when she called it off and it makes me so sad I love her very much. I can't think of a reason why but it might be because I peed in the shower while we were in there together but it was an emergency. I didn't think she noticed and I don't want to bring it up in case she did notice. We are young and were wearing swimsuits so there is no way she could have known. How do I convince her to get back together with me she said I'm very gross and I would hate to have her break up with me because of an emergency. Also she still a little mad I kissed her best friend during spin the bottle last week (she was playing to and kissed another guy but I don't care) but she forgave me for that. She caught me texting her and she started crying and said I'm disgusting. This is my second girlfriend if this helps.
20090309175352AAOdZQC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can a person just stop liking people in general, being attracted to people too?	I have a husband and we have been together for 6 years. I feel like I used to love him so much more and it's not anything he has done, it's all me. I just can't stand people at all. I don't find anyone attractive, not my husband, not someone walking down the street, not celebrities. Nothing presses that button anymore. I feel what is the word? A sexual maybe? I don't know how to describe it, I just feel like I hate people in general. I have no desire to have friends, I am isolated to the point that I never see another person besides my husband for months. We don't get along very much after I had our baby 7 months ago. I used to be so sexual and so outgoing and now I am the opposite. Sex makes me sick. It's just so over rated and I just don't want anyone to touch me or look at me. It makes me sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me?
20090309170511AAStoyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he doing this? Please give me some advice!?	My boyfriend's fashion-sense is... not exactly modern shall we say... just to give you an idea , he buys clothes from charity shops that would look suitable on a granddad. I never used to mind so much but people mock, point, laugh, stare and bully the both of us.. I asked him to just tone it down a bit and maybe start wearing more modern colours or something but he refuses to do so.      At the beginning of our relationship, I had to take my lip piercing out, dye my hair brown and kind of stop being gothic so he would be happy with me... but then he says that he doesn't see why HE should have to change. Hey buddy, didn't I change everything about myself for you?      I'm just fed up of being bullied and ridiculed... he doesn't care and I know I shouldn't either, but it's hard when everyone is laughing at you.      Shall I just end it? I'm so fed up and I haven't got the energy to keep it going. It seems as though I put all the effort into our relationship.      Any advice would be great. Thanks.

One day at lunch my best friend asked me who that boy is and I said his name is John and that he seems nice but is very quiet. Well I think someone at my lunch table heard me and told him what I said so when I got home I went to check on his online away message and it said "Think im quiet probably because you never said anything that I could respond to, so pissed off." Why would he be "pissed off"?   I didn't mean it in a bad way Im really quiet too. I want to talk to him but I am scared to and he keeps looking at me but wont talk. He stears at me alot but wont say anything, my friends tell me he is a psycho for acting all dramatic..then one day he had on his away message saying " I have given up on you." Then it said "No one takes me seriously eh its all good"   what does he mean?    I know though away messages where about me because it happened the day that I said he was quiet.   why is he getting all mad?      also my teacher changed our seats in class and he sits up front now and I sit in the back and he gets like nervous and I always see him looking out of the conner of his eyes and sometimes he will get up to get a tissue witch is right near my desk but wont talk but just stear?

I have asked out a countless amount of girls, all of which said no, but when I saw her picture on myspace, after almost 5 years, every feeling that I had for her rose up again. We go to differen high schools and the extent of our conversations are on myspace. We don't talk in person because we never actually see each other. She is a popular, beautiful girl and I'm your average guy, fit, but not slim and athletic. I just wanted to know if I should just tell her that I have liked her since 1st grade and hope she feels the same way or just talk, as friends on myspace and be haunted every day thinking if I would have just told her, there was a slim chance she would have felt the same way.      Please help, this is probably the biggest dilema to hit my life so far!!!

Today in art this girl I just met (and who I have a crush on), went up to me, and ask me to help her draw a shell...and we pretty much sat together, and talked during the whole class...Like I offered to help her, on AIM, but yea, she asked..      She also saw I had a bread, and said she doesnt like facial hair, but then said the way I cut mine was cool...and then whil eI was drawing, she said "Your big", cos Im pretty tall, and I've been lifting weights. Could she had been checking me out?      Its either 1 of 3 things. She just used me to draw for her...She was just being friendly, or she likes me, and used that to get to know me...I wanna ask her out to hang to get to know her better, but I think its to soon...we just met a week ago.

20090309162054AArWDi5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do so many people say woman that date rich men are gold diggers?	I don't understand the double standard. A guy can say he only dates Blondes with Big Boobs, constantly use us for sex, and lie about the fact they will never commit to get in your panties, but a girl can't choose to date only wealthy men? Wealthy men need love too. The main cause of problems in relationships/marriages is money, so why not eliminate that factor? What woman doesn't want her first date to start with reservations at the most exclusive French restaurant in town eating 3 course meals accompanied by a bottle of wine, followed by sailing on a yacht drinking champagne, eating strawberries and listening to jazz while enjoying each others company? Why do some woman and men hate the fact some woman dream of they're cinderella stories, while others actually make it happen? Why does one have to be a "gold digger" because she falls in love with men in rich places? Some women go to school 10 years to get masters and prominent degrees and work really hard and I think that, that is great! But some women don't want that for their lives, and who are we to say that they are wrong? If a man can pay your way through college, and by you a shiny new mercedes to go along with it all b/c of how much you loved him, would you not be satisfied with the relationship if it didn't work? Or would rather have got nothing and still be in the same place struggling through school, and working at the nearest retail store? Tell the truth ladies. Do you want to marry a handsome multi-millionaire, or a handsome Mc. Donald's manager?? Especially when you can fall in love with both.

20090309162737AAILgB4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think i should break up?	My gf and i have been together for 3 months, we're happy together and we love each other so much. However, i have some doubts about our relationship. Over the last 3 months, she broke up with me 3 times, but she always wanted me back. However, although i love her very much, she always makes me feel sad for some reasons - but i must admit that we had good times together as well.      Firstly, my friends and my classmates tell me she's kinda avoiding me at school and they think that she's not comfortable around me at school, they think that she is not her usual self with me at school and as a matter of fact, we dont spend breaks together - i really wanna be with her in break but she doesnt like to spend time with me at school, she also does not let me give her hugs at school. Secondly, when i talk to her about something or she wants to talk to me about something important that concerns us, she ends up never telling me. Thirdly, i think shes hinding something from me, and she's always shy around me and i think she has more trust in her friends and she is more open with them as well. In addition, she wants to break up with me when we graduate (we're sophomores) and i really want to be with her in college but she apparently doesnt.      so i thought to myself, why am i wasting so much with her? why am i gonna waste 2 years of my life with her if she wants to do that? and why am i still with her if i am having so many doubts about our relationship? what do u think i should do?

20090309161237AAWgOlm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to ask out a friend of mine?	OK i go to a Saturday Polish school and want to ask this one girl out on a date. the problem is I'm a year older then her, and i only see her around her friends on Saturdays.   i just don't know what to say if i get the opportunity to talk to her alone, which occurs like once in a while   and if i don't get that opportunity should i ask her out by her friends and what should i say      i just don't want it to seem awkward      and i have known her for more then a year   she is a sophomore and I'm a junior in high school   she is almost the opposite of me where I'm quite and she is not   so that is the problem i have never asked a girl out before and I'm definitely going to ask her out on Saturday      and i think she likes me, this is what she does   she smiles when she talks to me   is always watching me   goes by my friends and starts to eat and drink my stuff   call me by my little kid name in Polish         so what should i say to her, like do you want to go in a date fri. or thurs., or do you want to go to the movies      and if i don't get the opportunity to ask her out when she is alone, what should i say to her by her friends without it being awkward

20090309161631AA0i7oV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's mom, what should i do?	Me and my boyfriend have been together now for a little over a year. At one point we broke for you know typical boyfriend and girlfriend issues. (I was being too clingy basically is what it was…wasn’t the cool girlfriend, jealous and insecure.) But were past that phase now and we have moved on from that. I love him more than anything and we both have changed our ways. Back when we were together I slapped him on the side of the face twice…once in the beginning of the relationship and the second time was in the middle of our relationship, I had my reasons why but I came to realize there is no excuse to ever slap your significant other and I learned that the hard way after we broke up. But now that he has forgiven me for that and were trying to move forward it seems like we can’t. His mother which I don’t blame her for being upset with me for what I had done to her son back when were together in the beginning is still very upset about what happened. I apologized to both my boyfriend and his mother for what I had done, that I am ashamed of it and it will never happen again. My boyfriend has forgiven me and we want to be happy but it’s hard his mom doesn’t want me around. She doesn’t want me to come near her house, when me and my boyfriend first broke up she didn’t want me around he kept seeing me without her knowing and I wasn’t allowed in the house but then when I spoke to her and apologized for being disrespectful I started coming around again and I have been for the past 2 months, she made it seem like she had forgiven me, but this past weekend out of nowhere she was upset that I was there, and she told me upfront I’m not over it, things haven’t changed, please leave. I don’t understand so much time as passed since this has happened like 7 months since the slap in the face incident took place and I have done everything in my power to try to make it right. Were trying to move on but it’s hard when his mom gets involved and brings up things from the past that were both trying to let go of and now I’m not allowed in his house, or see his family, family is a huge thing to me and it’s important that I get along with my boyfriends family just like I would want my own parents to get along with him. It’s crucial to me. What do I do…this is so hard because I just want us to be happy and move on but she is making it impossible. She makes it seem like I cheated on him or did something extremely horrible, but all this keeps re-surfing and I can’t take no more. I am good to him now we respect other more than we ever have, we don’t deserve it, I don’t deserve this, I made a mistake how much longer do I need to be given crap for it. He has forgiven me we have been through so much which is why we’re still going strong. Even an unplanned pregnancy where I lost the baby and now we’re trying to leave that chapter behind… all the mess that dragged us down but how are we able to move on if she just won’t let it go? I care about him so much and I’m afraid that she is pushing me away. If your a girl reading what would u do if you were in my situation? If your a guy reading this and you really cared about your girlfriend and your mom was this way what would you do?

I don't want to ask him and i'm way to shy to ask him anyway. I would just like an honest opinion so I know.         Here are some of the signs:         He stares at me a lot from the other side of the room.         When he is with his friend he isn’t shy and makes me laugh and smile but when we are on our own he is quiet and shy.         He said a band I like sucked and when I was gone asked my friend if I said anything about it.         He pushed his friend into a drum kit when I was watching and looked for my reaction....

20090309164000AA7JlEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have some boy confusion?	OK, so my boyfriend (of 6 months) and I broke up in November. He called me about 2.5 weeks ago and said he missed me and regretted letting me go, blah blah blah. So we started hanging out again. I spent the night at his house a week ago, he was very sweet, and as always we got along incredibly...he hasn't called me since. He said he would call me later in the weekend which would have been yesterday, but didn't. What the heck? Should I not be pissed?
20090309164406AA2xydI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I break up with my boyfriend without turning it into a disaster?	Okay so me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 2 months, and I'm starting to go crazy, but I don't know how to break it off? He's really sweet, and I do care about him, but i just don't see us working out or anything changing. So here's some details:   -We met this summer at a concert   -I found him again two months ago on myspace.   -We started officially "dating" the first day we hung out.   -All his past girlfriends have cheated on him, so he can't trust me worth ****.   -He has attempted suicide after one of his exes dumped him (and he tells me our relationship is stronger then theirs was)   -He tells me I'm the love of his life, I'm 17 and he's 16.   -He gets offended if I don't say it back.   -He makes me promise when I tell him I love him.   -He talks about getting married when I turn 18.   Don't get me wrong, some of the things he says are sweet, but I've been in a clingy relationship like this before and I hate it. I know we aren't going to get married, and i just can't see this working anymore. I need to get out now, but I don't know how? And our 2 month anniversary is in 3 days. Any suggestions?

20090309170149AAJVeNo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have problems in my relationship, what should I do?	I feel like lately my bf and I haven't been doing as well. I know that each relationship changes as time goes on but I'm really confused. He says things that bother me and that I think a boyfriend should know not to say, for instance we watched a movie with a bunch of friends and he kept talking about the graphic sex scene and how it was the same as 300, he was the only one talking about it while his friends and my friends were just quiet. The last couple of times we've hung out he invites his friends and they always want to do their own thing, like golfing. I'm not really into golfing and he knows this but yet makes plans with me and then his friends. I told him how i felt and how I wished we'd hang out just the two of us and he said if he knew he would have done that, but I mentioned that day that we should just hang out by ourselves. I just think he should know these things. I'm not saying we shouldn't hang out with people but its nice to be alone sometimes and do our own thing, and it feels like lately that hasn't been the case. He also lives on his own and his friends usually stop by a few times a week, and he lives with his best friend. And because of what I've said  on how i was kinda upset and kinda hurt ...we're all weird, I don't know if its normal to have these phases or what, I love him but I'm really confused now.

And he doesn't say or do anything for her to do that.      Just saturday night, me and him was in the living room at his house, he was on the computer, and I was watching tv, not even touching each other, and she comes yells something at him.   (I don't know what she said, cause she yelled in Vietnamese.)      So, my question is, is there anything he can do, to fix things with his mom?      Cause this is getting awkward.
