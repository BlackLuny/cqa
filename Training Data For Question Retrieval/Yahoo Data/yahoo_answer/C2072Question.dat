20090219183312AAvWXEQ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Disturbed about yahoo answers? Is yahoo and hotmail the same so I can switch?	I asked a question about mailing things to Puerto Rico and some idiot for some reason got my question deleted.  I complained to yahoo about the person who did this and how she didnt answer my question, just ranted and insulted me and my family( I have no idea why).  Anyhow, after they deleted the question and emailed yahoo explaining what happened and they said that I was the one in the wrong instead of the girl who insulted me.  Than after I blocked her, she went into her other account that she just opened that day and responded again to the answer, but not answering the question but she continued insulting me.  Im thinking about closing my account because yahoo is not being fair in this. I dont get why my question on mailing things to my home should have gotten deleted when she was  the one insulting me. Why the stupidity?! Is hotmail and yahoo the same comp, Im going to switch and to hell with yahoo.

20090219204427AAi8quq	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Accounts & Passwords	What could I do to get my password for my real account that some one changed the password to.?	Ok my real account    http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...    was hacked into by some guy and then changed the password for my Yahoo account. I have tried contacting Yahoo, but they said there was nothing they could do. Now I know I'm typing my password in correctly because I wrote it on a piece of paper and hid it. The reason my avatar is blurry is because right now, some one hacked into my real account, but I guess you knew that. The reason I am telling you about my avatar is because this happened before. Every time I'd ask, some one would think I was the troll because of that. I don't know why. Also, If your wondering how I got back to my account last time, they changed the password back to my old one when they were done messing around. They sent me an email saying "Haha! We really screwed up your yahoo answers account but now were done. We changed your password back to normal haha.". Only the email was from my email address. It's like they sent the email to my email form my email.

This morning my BF asked me why had I sent him an email at 4:32am, and said I sent his spam, however, I never sent him anything. When I came home and checked my email, all my contacts were erased and indeed all my contacts received the same email he did this morning. But my password was not changed and my personal info on my profile was still the same but I purposely never put the right info in my personal profile except for my name. The spam says      Dear friend,   i would like to introduce a good company who trades mainly in electornic products. Now the company is under sales promotion, all the products are sold nearly at its cost. They provide the best service to customers,they provide you with original products of good  quality,and what is more,the price is a surprising happiness to you! It is realy a good chance for shopping.just grasp the opportunity,Now or never!   The web address:  http://www.jvccn.com       I never gave anybody the password, nor did I give the info on any website. I already changed my password and ran spyware, nothing came up. Is my computer also at risk? or just the email account? I usually do online billing but at this point, I'm not sure if that is safe. Any suggestions?????????

Firstly, please do not answer my initial question as I don't want this one removed as well!!      I asked about websites where you can download owners manuals.  This was a legitimate question as I had in the past visited such a site and acquired manuals for my bosch oven and also a panasonic dvd player.  Since finding the question deleted, I myself found the website again - it is still there and legitimate.      Why would this happen?  Any ideas?      Thanks in advance.

20090219202926AABvZ1f	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	This is great! Read and reply if you want!?	There are inspirational stories I stumble upon that make me say, “I wish I had written that.” This is one of those stories. The author is unknown, but, no doubt, she was a wise woman.      “The Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box. ‘There are five things you need to know,’ he told the pencil, ‘before I send you out into the world. Always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best pencil you can be.’      ‘One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in Someone’s hand.      ‘Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, but you’ll need it to become a better pencil.      ‘Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.      ‘Four: The most important part of you will always be what’s inside.      ‘And, five: On every surface you are used on, you will leave your mark. No matter what the condition, you must continue to write.’      “The pencil understood and promised to remember and went into the box with purpose in its heart.”      I think we sometimes forget our purpose. We stumble through the day, doing what has to be done without thought to what needs to be done. Henry Kissinger is credited with saying “the urgent takes all the time from the important.” We need to get back to the important. Like a pencil, we leave our mark on each life we touch.        http://likemylife.homestead.com/parableo...

Every other day when for the past 2 weeks I have logged into my email account and a message appears that I am being disconnected from yahoo chat because I have logged into another device. I do not have messenger on my pc and i do not use internet on my phone. I am the only one that uses my computer and I have changed my password several times. I have AVG, spyware blaster and spyware doctor and i do not go to malicious sites.    I assumed my account was being hacked so I kept changing my passwords. Tonight it had the same message until I clicked on my yahoo and then my mail. The 2nd browser said I was connected and the 1st still said I was disconnected. Does that mean I have a browser problem? Or is someone hacking into my mail?   By the way my friend was online before me and said he didnt see me online until the time I chatted with him so I'm guessing I wasnt already connected?
