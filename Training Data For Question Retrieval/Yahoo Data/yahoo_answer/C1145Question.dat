I went for a 'pre-op' last month, and the nurse claimed that it was unnecessary for her to carry out MRSA swabbing on me, to see if I was a carrier, as the chanced of me being a carrier were low. Today, I recieved a package with swabs, and a note from her saying I need to do it myself, I sent the samples back, and now I am worry that if I am a carrier, do they still proceed with my surgey, and just take extra precauctions and put me on some medication, or will they cancel my surgery????? :(

20090304075420AAEkLr0	Beauty & Style;Makeup	What do you think would be the perfect foundation for me?...?	I'm 23 and I love make up, I wear it (almost) everyday, and I have no problems at all with my eye make up, but I still haven't found my perfect foundation.    When I was younger I had really good skin, and hardly ever wore foundation, from the age of 16-18 I wore just a tinted moisturiser to give my skin a little more colour.    After suffering from Hyperthyroidism my skin got a little more oily, and although I don't really get spots (just the odd one now and then) my skin doesn't look as good as it used to, I started using Maybelline's mineral (powder) foundation, which worked quite well, but I have quite fair skin, and recently I've noticed that the lightest shade seems to have got a little too orange for my liking.    Right now I'm using Maybelline's liquid mineral foundation, with an oil/shine free powder by 17 (from Boots) on top, which looks really good when I first put it on, but a couple of hours later my face looks too shiny. I even tried using GOSH's make up base, it makes my skin really soft, so the foundation goes on really well, and it helps give a flawless finish, but doesn't stop my face from getting shiny after only about 2 hours.    I'm looking for a new foundation for no more than ￡15. Could anyone recommend one?   Three foundations that I've heard are good for oily skin are: Maybelline Super stay foundation, L'Oreal True Match foundation (powder or liquid) and L'Oreal Infallible foundation.    Has anyone tried them? Which is the best? Do you know of one which works better than those three?   Thanks in advance.   Sam x

Hi,   in the past few months I've started to have bad underarm smell, the problem is, it doesn't smell like sweat, I've changed deodorants five times, it doesn't help, and it happens within a few minutes usually in the late morning or early afternoon.. it just smells kindda old I guess.. it's weird! i do have excessive sweating (which has gotten a bit better since the summer) but i've never had BO.. it really bugs me because I don't like to get near people when I start smelling the smell.. which is a big problem at work and school.. ughh.. :(

Okay, so I want to get my tongue pierced, but I'm a bit nervous... I already had my lip pierced... Actually my friend Kimme did it for me on our lunch break from school. We went to my place, and she had a professional piercing needle. We boiled water, dropped te needle in, sterilized it for five minutes. Placed it in a shot glass, poured hydrogen peroxide over it, wash our hands, pulled it out, dried it with a napkin, put some Vaseline on it.(It's supposed to make the needle slide through better.) And she pierced me lip. Apperenately I have stretchy lips, because my lip gave her the worse time of her life. She said it stretched so far before the needle even poked through the back of my lip. She's pierced quite a few lips, and said this has never happened to her before. When I got her to pierce my ear shortly after, same thing. Lol. She also had a really hard time getting the ring in... But not once did I wince. Even when I had to change the ring the day after it was pierced, and the second day after it was pierced. Anyways, it never got infected, neither did my ears.      Just wondering, which hurts more? Lip or tongue? Or what would you compare the pain to?

20090227063105AAjiN4l	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Need help, Guns in Tattoos?	My fiancee is saving up to get a large chest-piece and he wants to include the image of a revolver he owns in the tattoo.       Now here's the hard part, he's o.c.d and has this freakish sense of Symmetry. He feels if he gets the gun tattooed on him as part of the chest piece the gun has to be present on the other side for balance which is reasonable but then he also thinks its silly to have two of the same gun tattooed on you if you only own one of the gun (which costs about 2k).       So should I tell him to go ahead and get his 2nd gun first and worry about the tattoo when he can afford it, or tell him he'd never need to carry 2 of the same thing so it'd be a waste of money, and hope that he can make himself ok with the concept?      or if you have another idea I'm open to suggestions.

I got it pierced last year in the summer holidays and it was done with a gun, and pierced with an earring like stud.   I kept it in for 6 weeks for had to take it out for school, as they dont allow it but always put it back in after school.   It healed and cause of this i once didnt put it in for a couple of days (thinking it would be okay) but when i did it wouldn't go in and when i did, i think i might have re-pierced it again.   So either way i've carried on this way, taking it out when im going to school, but putting it back in when im at home.   But now i've got like a little bump on top of the piercing hole, i always get them but is there anyway for me to get rid of them permanently?   I have quite oily/spotty skin and wear a lot make-up, and i also have a bump, inside the the nose.   I can feel it, but not see it =/   Is it cause i wear a lot of make-up?

Then not too long ago, maybe about a month ago, i dyed my hair black and im still straightening it. the only difference now is that when ever i get out of the shower, my hair does this really weird frizz thing that doesnt look normal and  it does that even whyen i blow dry it, when i straighten it, it looks fine but it looks sooo dead and i cant even wear a white t shirt anymore, because i look down on my shirt and my hair has fallen out ALLL over it. when i brush my teeth in the sink, ill look down and see my hair all in the sink. and all you have to do is pull my ends and you got a pretty good size hand full of my hair in your hands. :O how do i fix this??? i NEED help!! i gotta save my hair SOON!!

20090304110155AA6mSte	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Need a new foundation?	I used to use clinique foundation, but stopped because of the expense and switched to the maybelline dream matte mousse which you can buy at any walmart. It's worked pretty good I'll admit, but I'm ready for a change. I have dry skin, some wrinkles that I shouldn't have for my age, and an uneven skin tone, and my pores show. In other words my skin is not perfect. I feel like the foundation just sinks into my wrinkles and sometimes just makes my skin look worse. Above that, I feel like it's just contributing to my problems! So I need something new, something that will make my skin look great and have it's benefits. Any ideas? I'll take cheap to expensive. Cheap would be best since I'm a college student, but I'm trying to do what's best for my skin so I'm willing to pay a little more. I've heard brands like mineral wear? Or something like that? Are those good?  What should I look for? Help please. I need a good change :)

We have decided we are going to get a tattoo together on our tenth anniversary. We met in 9th grade french class and the movie "A Walk to Remember" changed our lives!!!      We have decided to get the phrase "A single soul dwelling in two" tattoo on us. It is not only a phrase describing friendship from Aristotle but it is also said in the movie "A Walk to Remember". The final touch would be to translate it into French.      Please if you know how to translate it or tell me where i could find a place to get it translated. We took french but neither of us were good at it LOL!        Also opinions on this idea are definately welcome!!!      Thanks so much cuties!!!

Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

The needle is specially for ear piercings, says so on the back, and ive pierced a lot of stuff before with hollow needles, but i got 100 of these and would like to know how to use them.      They are basically looking like a safety pin end with a hollow tube around it that can slide off, do i put the whole thing through then pull out the needle and insert jewlery? Or whats up?      Both the needle and sheath are metal.

20090304122356AAsaJyv	Beauty & Style;Hair	Greasy hair, never had it before?! HELP!?	Hey, I have never really had greasy hair and I was my hair every day in the morning around 5am in the shower. Ive always just washed, rinsed, conditioned, rinsed, and was done. I would put a tiny bit of product in and blow it dry then straighten. One day I blow it dry and my roots by my part are supersuper greasy! I figured i didnt wash out my conditioner enough so no biggy, but the next two days it happened again and i didnt use product after, switched brushes and shampoo and conditioner! Nothing is working and i am rinsing even more :( Help me pleaseeee! I have to go to a big show tonight!! Thanks:)
20090304122546AAzliAa	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Girls...do you find hollister jeans to be too tight and uncomfortable?	Okay, this is a serious question and I am seventeen, btw. When you girls, especially those who wear a lot of hollister jeans and stuff, do hollister jeans ever get uncomfortable? Like do they ever get uncomfortable to move around in? Cause it seems like I always see girls, again those who wear hollister, having to constantly pull them up by the belt loops and they look really embarrassed doing it. I've even seen some girls do it every five seconds. They look really awkward, like having to shift and pull to only get a couple of centimeters. It must be soooo embarrassing...      Not to be a jerk or anything, but I think its kinda funny when girls have problems with their jeans.  I mean, why torture yourselves by wearing tight jeans to show off the body but then be all worried about what's showing?
