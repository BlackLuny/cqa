Does anyone have more info on this or any other alternatives? Peace.

20090205041928AAFS5LT	Environment;Conservation	Do you feed wildlife in winter, if not please give a moment of thought for our wild birds and animals?	Do you feed wildlife in winter, if not please give a moment of thought for our wild birds and animals that are finding life difficult with this weather. Even if you simply cut up a slice of bread into small pieces and put out a dish of water it will help?   If you can buy fat balls and other wildlife food all the better, if you buy fat balls remove them from their netting as this is dangerous for the birds that can become stuck whilst eating from these nets. I use a gage and hang them on the washing line and in shrubs.
20090205052906AAlcNZy	Environment;Global Warming	Why can't "Global Warming" Believers and Skeptics just compromise and get along?	Why are believers and skeptics fighting each other so much?  Why can't we just get along?      Why can't a compromise be reached between the two sides that can make everyone happy?  Why are some people so attached to a political philosophy that they can't compromise for the good of everybody?      What are your ideas to help bridge a compromise between the two sides?  What should each side compromise on in order to come to an agreement about the science of man made global warming?      What would you compromise?

20090205071126AAc6207	Environment;Global Warming	What do you think about Chu's worst case projection that up to 90% of the Sierra snowpack could disappear?	The Secretary of Energy  warned climate change could wipe out California's farms by the end of the century by destroying snowpack that supplies much of the water to the state. In other words, the nation's "salad bowl" could become a vast dust bowl instead.      In his first interview since taking office, the Chu said his home state would suffer some of the most devastating effects of global warming if the world did not act to slow its advance.       http://www.reuters.com/article/environme...     http://www.thedailygreen.com/environment...

20090205081337AAWxtpa	Environment;Global Warming	Why should we limit our panic to just 90%?  Why not claim 99% or 100%, or even 110%?	Extremist claim that 90% of our water could be gone in just a few years.  They base this information on nothing but their own emotions and the amount of fear their predictions will generate.      So why do they stop at just 90%?  If a person gets scared at 90% chance, wouldn't they be more scared if you claimed 95%?  Would 99% or 100% be even more scarier?  And since people accept made up numbers like 90%, wouldn't they also believe numbers greater than 100% chance?      Why not just claim that there's a 110% chance that all of Earth's water will be gone if we don't act on "Global Warming" by noon?      Clearly this would cause just as much of a scare, right?
