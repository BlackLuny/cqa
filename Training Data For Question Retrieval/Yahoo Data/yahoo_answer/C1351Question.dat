20090203121250AALL10c	Social Science;Other - Social Science	The future......50 and 100 years time....?	What position do we think the world will be in in 50 or 100 years time from today?    For example in 1950s:  Decolonization was in motion  It was the first full decade of the cold war  The European Economic Community was formed (later to become the European Union)  Communism came to the American continent in the form of revolution in Cuba  Television was expanding to become the mainstream of home entertainment  Organ transplants were born  The first satellite was launched    In the 1900s:  Mass production of the car  Wright brothers flight  Last cavalry charge in modern warfare (Boer War)  New Imperialism  Death of Queen Victoria    Keeping in mind we have gone from age of Empires in the 1900s to age of democracy in 100 years, with all the technological, political, economic, social and militaristic advances we have seen through two World Wars and countless regime changing smaller wars, will we see much of the same in the next 100 years, or will there be new empires born (ascent of China, re-emergence of Russia, new powers [India, South America, Africa?]). Obviously new technologies will be born, perhaps we will see cures to AIDS and Cancer.......    Any thoughts? Any indications of how things will go....?

Lat night I dreamed that there was like a herd of Brachiosauruses walking in the field and they were huge! and the people from Jurassic Park was surprised to see them walking into a massive peanut patch field, even though they crushed all the peanuts. and one of them walked through a city and destroyed half of the towers, but they weren't gonna kill it because it already left.      Then the next dream was that I turned into Lady Gaga and there was a boy that wanted to go out with me, so I let him know that I was actually a boy, but we still went out together anyways, and I woke up. lol

20090221024841AAPZYEY	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I frequently have strange dreams when I'm sick?	Generally speaking, my dreams are pretty normal (the ones I remember anyway), but I've noticed lately that whenever I get sick, no matter how mildly, my dreams are much less realistic.        Could this be attributed to fitful sleep?  When I'm sick, I often wake up in the middle of the night, most likely from not being able to breathe out of my nose; could this uneven sleeping pattern cause such weird dreams?      As a quick example of a normal, memory-consolidating, instinct-preparatory dream I would have, I might be working on a set for a musical on the stage of my high school auditorium.  This is to be expected; I'm working on scenic drops and platforms in the theatre almost every day, so it's practically expected to turn up in my dreams at some point.  I might see my drama teacher in the dream, a fellow actor or techie.  Quite honestly, the best way to describe it would be a "real situation."      But let's say I were sick; the dream would make very little sense, and usually be a situation I would never find myself in.  I remember being sick and having a dream about pirates that transitioned first to the Silent Hill video games, then to a tornado sweeping through the town, and finally with me learning to surf.  Really random, unrelated stuff, you know?  And it usually feels very disjointed, like something is always wrong.      Does illness really cause your brain to process things *that* differently?
20090203121343AA95YSO	Social Science;Economics	Macroeconomics - Simple CPI and Inflation?	Well I was studying for my next macroeconomics test and I tried the sparknotes online test.      Link:       http://www.sparknotes.com/economics/macr...          So on the very first problem, 1.1, the question asks to find the inflation from year 1 to year 2.       So what I did was trying to find the CPI is:      (nominal price of year 2)/(real price of year 2) x 100 = and got CPI value of 100...       To be honest i thought the formula was nominal/real x 100 = CPI      and from there on I am stuck of finding out the inflation because I cannot compute the CPI value. I know that sparknotes show the solution, but it doesn't show you how to compute the CPI value for this very particular question.      So can anyone compute the CPI value for each equation for me ? (like show me your work and what formula you used)       Thanks in advance.

Even people I was pretty close to in the beginning. I am acting completely weird, not functioning at work at all!.

But I dont feel anything at all about this..    I am aware of the fact that I am behaving like ****, but my emotions wont follow, so no ability to feel remorse or  guilt. I dont think about anything at all, it is crazy. I feel retarded. This has been me my whole life, initiating relations to other people and than they have just ended. Same with my family. They speak about things and I show no interest, I am a hypoconder trying to find a reason for my behaviour while it is all in my personality...

20090221035514AA44jVt	Social Science;Anthropology	What do you think of the term "democracy"?	I feel like it's a word that's thrown around without much consideration. An overwhelming majority of people in America would tell you that they live in a democracy, although our government is actually classified as a federal constitutional republic.      On a social note, isn't it strange how tied up the American psyche is in believing that the government is a "DEMOCRACY"? It feels at times that people without democracy are looked at as less than by Americans, although they don't even live in a democracy themselves (let alone understand the term).      Thoughts?      P.S.: I am an american, and I don't wipe my *** with the flag. Thank you very much.

20090221023328AA0uMTE	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	So I had a dream about this boy I kinda like...?	1st off this is the 1st time I ever really went after a guy...they usually come to me.      He's slowly becoming my close friend and he's really sweet and nice to me and flirty. He's a really nice kid so he could just be being friendly but im starting to get the idea that he likes me...and im definitely getting a crush on him.      so last night I had a dream that we became boyfriend and girlfriend. The only problem is that in my dream I kept feeling like it wouldn't work out. I kept getting these vibes that he didn't like me as much as he said he did...and I felt like for some reason my personality was changing once we started going out and he didn't like that. It didn't feel like a good relationship, or one that would work out.      Is that a sign of things to come or something? Like is my dream trying to tell me we would make a bad couple? I can't imagine myself with him as my boyfriend, maybe because he is the complete polar opposite of my last b/f and I've never been with anyone like him. But I do like him a lot so I don't know...       any ideas? thoughts?

In my dream i was at school and it was the beginning of lunch. so we went to our usual spots to eat lunch. however when we got there the wall where we normally sit didn't seem to be there. instead there was a gorgeous beach with beautiful soft clean sand. and the seawater was a beautiful shade of blue, like something u would find on a tropical island. the people who we normally eat lunch with were already in the water with there swimsuits on,they called for us to join them so we took our uniforms off to find that we had our bikinis on underneath. and we went and joined them. then like an hour later the bell went and we all went to get changed. i then realised that i didn't have a towel so i asked if any1 had a spare and they said that i could go buy one over there (pointing towards the science block). i went to have a look and instead it being filled with chemicals and gas taps it was a shop like the kind u would find on the side of a beach where it sells stuff like swimsuits and towels and inflatables etc. so i bought a towel and went to get changed. as i didn't know where they were i followed some people (who looked like they had just come out of the water as well) into the d+t block instead of workbench's and sewing machines and cookers there one long corridor  so i walked down it and at the end i turned a corner into a room as big as a cathedal. and there were changing rooms cramped into every space u could see. i walked around trying to find a free one when i woke up.      what on earth does it mean?

It usually goes away and i can move if i stay awake for 5 minutes or so but its a horrible experience! If i try to keep my eyes open, my ears start making a loud ringing sound.. and it hurts. But if i go back to sleep, i usually just wake back up again-      the other night it happened 3 times in a row (the same night)      Its been happening (not every night but occasionally) for about 5 years..      My sister says its because the brain shuts off the muscles so you won't literally act out your dreams, like dogs do. So if you wake up in the middle of it, you are paralyzed?      But is there any easier way to stop it then just going back to sleep? Because when I wake up from it I usually want to.. actually wake up

From the personal message I can perceive that she had a fun time last night. Because I feel my life isn't fun at all. I just read book and watch videos to learn something to improve myself. My whole daily life is to struggle for survival. So the fact that she had a fun time puts me to a great shame. All my activities every day is to struggle for survival while her life content is to have a fun time. She doesn't need to worry about survival. She is superior to me. I feel inferior. I think she may look down upon me even if she won't say it. I feel shame and uneasy. Help

Please read the questions and the concluding sentence before answering these questions. Thank you.      We don't have surplus money to draw from, these government projects are being done from borrowed or printed money.      How long will this continue in your opinion?      1. What happens when they stop funding the US?   2. What happens when we have to pay them back?   3. What happens when we have to raise interest rates on the Treasury Bonds to satisfy their worries about us paying them back in full value?

20090221023510AAoHM74	Social Science;Economics	Economy Idea: Smart or just dumb?	I am not smart nor do I know how the economy really works, but I was just thinking while reading the sad news that why cant these lenders forgive everyones debt since they are not getting it anyways then automaticly re-fi every morgage, loans, students loans,credit card debt and come up with a new payment so people can start paying. People that are currently un-employed will be givin three months to find a job and then start making payment if not then they may repo. If this has to do with tax issue then have the goverment wavie that. Then they should erase everyones credit report and start over. THen become stricter with lending and make it hard for people with low income to get in a finicail bind.I mean if you house has been repo take it off the credit report if you car has been repo take it off the credit report credit card debt in collections take it off the credit report. Pay off americans debt by paying off these collection agencys. Once american have a perfect credit score and still have a good job and are making payments again we will start investing and borrowing smart and have the goverment reg the lending services. I mean any one that has lost a house remove it from there credit score. Any one with 1-3 months past due for give it and not go after them but re fi to a low rate 5-6% then get them a lower payment say if you house payment was 1200 lower it down to 900 then set it on a fix rate and dont adj just my idea tell me if it makes sense or just dumb

20090221025216AAifLok	Social Science;Psychology	Do you feel that you are different from everyone else?	I just realised why I feel I cannot form close friendships with the people I know so far - I have completely different values to them. I'm never satisfied with being ordinary and I have high standards, both in  academics and extracurriculars. When others are shopping or watching movies, I like to plan my next project, whether it is applying to Ivy League or winning major awards/prizes. I don't like many of the typical teenage activities, e.g. pointless partying, but this does not mean I'm an introvert. I am an outgoing person and heaps of people tell me I have an awesome sense of humour but I don't like participating in social activities that I feel waste my time, which can be better invested in doing things I value more.      And because I actually achieve the high goals I set for myself, most people use me as some sort of benchmark and idolise/admire me or are resentful/jealous of me. Due to such factors, I never feel that I can form a close, mutual friendship with anyone, even though I can easily make friends (however, when circumstances change and people move away, I often don't bother to keep the friendship as I never felt that we were that close anyway and I can always meet new people).      Perhaps I do isolate myself by not participating in the typical teenage activities, but I never feel lonely when I'm by myself as I always know what I want out of life and how to get there. I know I have to try harder than the average person because I have higher goals in life than the average person. Am I wrong for wanting more out of life than the normal person? I always feel that other people and I are playing by different rulebooks, driven by different principles and steered towards different life goals. Does anyone else feel the same way as me?

In the dream,    me and two of my friends we're going to this building which was still in the early stages of construction.   we decided to get the lift round the back to go straight up to the first floor,    we got in the lift, which was basically just a cage, and my friend pushed the button to go up.   i watched in horror as the lift went up straight past the first floor and hundreds of feet into the air.   turns out it wasn't a lift for the building, it was attached to a crane.   the builders notices straight away what had happened but could not get us down so we were just hanging up there.   something happened and one of the cables snapped and the door to the cage/lift was open.   me and my friends we hanging on to the sides of the cage so we wouldn't fall out,    and i noticed that although my friends were hanging on without any trouble, i kept slipping and almost fell, then i hung on again and it was no problem for me.
20090221034600AAbxubZ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Would feminists be up in arms if?	VAWA was WAMA?      Many feminists argue that VAWA is gender neutral in it's writing - which isn't entirely true (it has various sections which specify women only). However, even IF it were the case, the title alone still implies that only women are victims and children & men are of no consequence.   As women are the primary abusers of children (especially male children) and men are the primary targets of violence - would feminists demand the title "WAMA" be changed to "VAPA" if we had a sexist title as "VAMA"? (M=men)

20090221060546AA73kBp	Social Science;Psychology	Am I over-analyzing or what?	Because I'm known to do that since I have OCD.

He cares about me enough to care about my best interest but not that much.      The only reason I can think of why he gave me the side hug instead of a regular or shoulder hug is because his pants were bulging(if you know what I mean).  I know that if a guy has an erection it means nothing.      3years before when he left for 2 years he gave me a long tight warm hug and wouldn't let go unless I did.      What does that tell you?

I seem to be having realistic dreams, and ones that can really happen like once I was in Math class and there was a real question that I figured out.      And when I was little (like 7) I dreamed that my brother showed me a pokemon card (Charzard or something) and it seemed a few years later it happened and I felt really weird.      Also there was one with the girl that I "think" I like, and well it seemed to be in a few years time. Me and my friend were going to ask some girls to the prom. So we were in a lunch room I walked up to her, and I was to nervous and ran away. The next day I went up to her and asked, then put my head down waiting to be rejected. But she accepted, I was so happy but then I woke up.      And well if you can explain both of those it will greatly help. And with the think part, i really don't know if I like her lol. Sorry if these aren't detailed enough or they are too long :p. (These all happened in different dreams).   Thanks.

20090203064904AA9IkAp	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	well first, I had this dream yesterday where I guess I was like in the ghetto? and I left me phone in the car so I asked my mom for the keys, and went back. but when I got there the passsenger door was open and my ipod and phone were gone. then these black guys startd walking over to me so I started screaming and shut the doors real quick, I thought I had just locked the doors in time when someone came in from the truck. and they were saying "no, let us do just one thing" so I started screaming more. then they buckled my seatbelt for me. (LOL, i knoww!) so then we all started cracking up and hanging out. next a little black boy came and he had a dildo, and they just said he was "jacking off his penis" which he really was, the whole time. and in my dream we were watching something about elephant ***** in my car.         then the dream I just had last night, I was having sex with this guy I know, I went out with him last year but now were just friends, Were pretty good friends too. But in my dream it was like we were in a shower together and ended up having sex while another one of my good friends watched...         what do they mean?!!   :\\

20090219171409AADg32x	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you do when you don't like any of the women who like you nor what turns them on about you?	I hate how I look. I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something.      I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments. Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure. Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more.      I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature. I hate it, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know how to get over it.      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty". I'm immune to pop psychology platitudes.

20090219173946AAygMqX	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I dreamed that a boy I have no relations with was in love with me.?	The other night I had this really odd dream about this guy in my classes . His name is M. The thing is I don't talk to him nor are we really friends, but I do find his conversations in class interesting and find him to be a very funny person, even though sometimes if I were the teacher, I'd want to hit him lol.      So one night  I slept peacefully and this is how the dream goes:      I have my winter coat, hat and gloves on after my 4th class and I am on my way home. Before I leave I remember that I have to wait for my friend C since she is in our schools theatrical production. So I go downstairs to the auditorium where all the cast is practicing and some of the senior english teachers are involved too. So I walk into the rows where a number of my classmates are in the audience. I don't sit but stand in the audience as my friend Randy talks to me for a bit when a few of my other male friends along with M (the guy in my classes) come up to me and start talking to me. As most of my friends walk away I grow confused as M and one of his friends (who has two other classes with me) continue talking to me. The whole time M seems not like his usual sarcastic playful self. he seems a bit more mellowed out but at the same time he's like kinda chuckling a bit. So he's acting really nice to me but because of the way he appears I think he's just joking with me trying to be funny or something. I ignore him for a bit and watch them practice. Even though the actors are screwing up a bit.      This is where the dream gets wierd. M is staring at me while I am watching the rehearsal and after a while pulls me onto his lap. I am in complete shock. I try to get up and say stop joking around but he has me in a tight grip. So I sit there and watch the play again while his friend looks at him as if to say "good job" and turns back around. I feel a bit akward while on his lap because he's hugging me from behind in a loving embrace and last time I checked we don't even say hi to eachother. So the dream felt sooo real because while on his lap we're both watching them practice and I feel these vibes running up my spine. You know, the feeling you get when someone's staring at you or when you can just tell someone likes you. So He begins to rub his cheek on my shoulder and after a while kisses my cheek a few times in a really sweet and kind of funny way. The whole time I have a confused  look on my face. While his face is on my shoulder I can tell that his cheeks have flushed so I turn and look him in the eye and he's smiling up at me and he looks so innocent and vulnerable. He looked genuinely happy. It was odd because he normally has a bored look on his face...or he's scowling...sometimes both.      I get up off his lap and turn to a few other people and we talk about something un-important for a while when his friends come around him and they start talking about something quietly while he frequently turns around to look at me all weird. So one of the english teachers Mr Sidomer rushes past me and exits through the side door and a few other students follow and that causes me to fall along with my notebooks and papers I was all of sudden carrying (like, where did those come from?) And I'm splashing around in the papers all frantic sitting on my butt when he comes next to me and helps me up and starts helping me pick up my papers. So when finished he pulls me on his lap again as we watch them practice once more and at this point the mood is a little more calm but I'm still thinking in my head "wtf?"      So as the actors are ending their practice I get up off his lap and he grabs my hand and holds it as we both walk out of the row but he doesn't realize that I'm trying to get away from him. So he lets go of my hand as we near the door and I contemplate hugging him to say goodbye out of fear of him thinking I like him. So I just quickly mutter bye as I run over to Ms. Schlossberg and I ask her what the name of the play is (it has something to do with fairies and Shakespeare like stuff) and she says something weird that I can't really spell but it's pronounce "faw-vro!" and as she walks away that's when I wake up.      Ever since I had that dream, M and I have had just a little bit more   interaction in class and in the hallways and has been a lot nicer. What on earth does that dream mean? Of all people, him AND my English teacher??? this dream was more "normal" compared to my other dreams. But it felt real.

20090219173328AAPc2mi	Social Science;Psychology	Do you ever feel like life just ''SWOOSH" on by fast these days?	I always feel like life is going so fast these days. It won't slow down. I am happy but I am getting more depressed because of the thought of death. And being old and not being able to do much.      I just want to live with no fear of that. Everyone has a fear, but I'm only 16!! Why do I feel like this! I think about death and growing up and everyone I love dying too. It's something I think about all the time and everyday. You have no idea. I want to think of something else. Something a teen can think about. So I do not have to feel like this. I feel 80!      I even thought of suicide to end the pain of growing up and losing the ones I love. The thought of all of it is to hard. I do not want to commit suicide (I would never). I am not a fan of giving up.       Graduation. Getting 18 (an adult) and getting out of the house you can not be dependant on your parents anymore you have to be independant now going off to college getting your own job and home and not being able to do the old things you could do when living with your parents. Like asking your parents for permission to do this or that or asking them for money or having your mother take care of you when you are sick. No...I would have to take charge of MYSELF. Dealing with my loved ones deaths. Turning 40. Getting older than that and being to old to be, to be a kid again and have fun. Then your not attractive anymore and then your looking around and seeing all the young people live their young lives and being young to do all the fun stuff like dating(while I am knitting In my rocking chair) I would not be dating because I will not be attractive anymore and guys these generation want really young women.       Alzhiemers. That could be my biggest fear. :(...........................   I am terrified of getting old. I know that It Is going to happen.....soon   Does anyone else get worried?   Or Is It only just me? :-/

His friend, however, is wary of getting himself into a situation in which he might be responsible for Jeremiah's debts. What can Jeremiah do to alleviate this fear?

20090219172633AABO4H9	Social Science;Psychology	Why don't I feel normal?	Lately, I've been feeling extremely odd. (actually, I'd say it started towards the end of December) I kind of feel empty, with no emotions? I mean, sometimes I'll feel alright, but then i go back to feeling nothing again.           It also feels like i have to fake being normal or whatever around my friends, because i cant seem to make them understand how i feel. I've tried telling a few of them, but they either don't understand, don't listen, or they write it off as depression, which i really think it isn't.          Nothing new has really happened to me lately, so i can't think of why i feel so messed up in the head... gosh, I'm trying to make sense, but it really isn't working, is it?        okay, lately i haven't been able to fall asleep, and when i finally do sleep, i either have really weird dreams or it seems like i was just lying down for a bit, and the day started again, you know? My grades haven't slipped- they've actually been improving, but I can rarely concentrate in most of my classes, unless we're doing something really interesting.        Sometimes i feel like people are listening to my thoughts, and i know that's irrational, and then other times i feel like people are watching me, or something? Sometimes I'll look at windows or pictures or something and it looks like there's someone's face, and they're watching me. I also hear people saying my name occasionally, when no ones said anything close to it. I ask my friends if they heard anything, and they say no. This really freaks me out.       I've also been having communication problems. Whenever i say something it seems to come out wrong. Oftentimes i get really nervous while trying to make a conversation with my friends, so i stutter and stuff, which isn't usually like me.      Oftentimes i also find myself freaking out when i see water, because i almost drowned this summer. If i see anyone in lakes or oceans (even if it's on the television) or if they jump into the water, i find myself gasping for air, and i get flashes from the incident last summer... that didn't really have anything to do with my question/explanation, but i thought i'd throw it in there.      I worry a lot about random things most of the time, and it gets really irritating because i can't make it stop. Random thoughts seem to flow through my head almost all of the time. That's another problem. I can't seem to stop thinking about everything.       A few weeks ago, when a warm front moved in and the snow melted, i actually felt a lot better. I was bubbly like usual, and i didn't feel like i had one monotonous emotion, but then it snowed recently, and this weird feeling has come back.       I don't want to tell my mom how i feel, because I'm worried that she won't take me seriously, or that she'll think I'm saying that to get attention. I would like to think that she'd understand, since she's on anti-depressant/anxiety medication, as is my grandmother, but I really don't think she will. When i was younger (in middle school) I had some issues, and my school sent me to counseling, but my mom seemed to get mad at me for it, like i was doing something wrong, or like i shouldn't feel the way i did. At least, that's how i felt she felt at the time. (i think those are all the details)       I don't want to sound like I'm throwing a pity party for myself, because I'm really not, but i feel... weird, and i can't figure out why.

20090203095518AA64Gwb	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies,  do you think that the term "old maid" is sexist, and is it a stereotype towards unmarried  women ?	Unmarried women who are getting older,  I should say.  I was just reading this book,  about what we call women and why.  The name   of it, is somewhat graphic,  so I will keep that to myself.  But anyway.   So some people consider,  if you are a strong, independent, successful   woman,  then you are a "b".  Then there are those who have never   been married, and are very independent.  AND are aging.  Sometimes,   society dismisses such women as old maids. You know the woman   who may be bitter towards men,  and found her way through life   without being under the hand or influence of a male occupant.  Mama   may say,  son,  stay away from that woman.  You see she aint got no   husband,  and she never will have one.  She is washed up, and worn   out.  She is just a bitter old hag,  she is no good to you or anyone.   anymore.  Now is that a way to talk about a woman who was productive to our society.  Ladies,  what do you think about the   "old maid" label..............

20090203095332AA5LjO9	Social Science;Psychology	How do you think is it normal?	I just noticed that my co-worker talks to me in a lower voice than with other people. I mean when there are other people around us he speaks in a normal voice.  But today we were alone and he was talking to me in a low voice, and I without even willing it start talking in the same way. After such talk there is a very strange feeling left, cause generally we talk about work.   I think why does he talk only with me in a low voice? Is it normal?

20090203094814AAidOrB	Social Science;Psychology	I'm miserable... I don't know what to do. Is it normal?	I am 22 in a Master's Counseling program at my university. This is my second semester. I am taking 12 hours. The only problem is I have grown to really hate counseling. I just know it isnt the right field for me. Of course in grad school grades are easy but I really do not want to be a counselor. But I feel like I already have so much progress towards the degree that to stop and try something else now would be throwing away all that time. I already know I cannot drop my classes for a refund this semester but I really dread taking more counseloing courses during the summer, fall, and next spring to graduate. I really like cooking, nature, sports, and christmas stuff... I don't know... I just am rambling on because I need someone to let this out. I have talked to a career counselor but it's so frustrating b/c they dont really tell you anything. Well people just post your opinions. thanks
