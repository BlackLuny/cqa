jLTDqVHsaa	FireWire transmits the HDV recorded on your tape, and is the  way to transfer taped recordings.  No quality difference from the original footage (unless you set your camera to output DV instead of HDV via FireWire).  I am reasonably sure about this, but not 100%.  I admit that the technology is still rather new to me, and I haven't worked with it much.    This thread should clear things up a bit:  http://www.hv20.com/showthread.php?p=572...    If you capture to your computer via HDMI, DIRECTLY from the CAMERA (i.e. live, not taped), the quality will be better.  Once it's on the tape, though, it's HDV, and that's the same whether FireWire or HDMI.    Of course, in order to do that, you'd need a way to get HDMI IN on your comptuer.  That thread explains.|`|9mTctb7jaa	Use the "firewire" cable. firewire is not a video format, but rather a protocol for sending serial data. If you send data that represents HD video, it will pass just fine to the computer. HDV is the same datarate, 25 mbps, as regular miniDV which is why it is compatible.     I am not aware of any consumer or professional grade product that can record uncompressed HD video like you have in the HDMI cable. This data rate is about 1400 mbps! some day they may make devices with HDMI as an input, but most assuredly they will compress the data stream before recording.  But that will require multiple conversion(HDV to HDMI, HDMI to something else) each being lossy for quality. The firewire option requires no converting to make transfers, so it is lossless.|`|rhANJ8nuaa	To import uncompressed HD video you need the Black Magic Intensity capture pci card. They are extremely expensive, and just to capture you need a massive raid setup. Alternatively, there is the Canopus Pegasus pci card, which allows you to connect HDMI (or it might be DVI via hdmi-dvi adaptor) and it compresses it into their HQ-AVI format (so you dont need a raid to capture) which is still better quality than HDV , but is still very expensive. The other problem is that to get the benefits of HDMI you must capture 'live', therefore it is not practical for the average person, rather professionals who want the best and have lots of money to burn.
w4I9oj2Maa	OUCH...that sounds like a SLOW TV set. How old is it?    If it's older than 2 years...then it's SLOW.  3 years ago, gamers started complaining about LAG and Low refresh rates.    That's when engineers resolved the problem with 120 Hz refresh rates and 4 to 6 ms response times on the LCD panel TVs.    Now a work-around might be to use the LOWEST definition possible with your component cables OR even switching down to the old yellow-red-white connectors if they are available to you.  I know...that sucks.  But at least you get to play and WIN.

b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	You can get specialist IR lights for recording bats - these have a peak output of 810nm, so 830nm should be OK.  I don't know that it's "ideal" though - the "bat lights" are  a compromise so as not to disturb the bats, and the cut-off for the IR detector is around 1000nm.  I don't know where the peak sensitivity is, though.    I'd have thought that IR emitting LEDs would be a better option than using a filter.

x0lGvsJXaa	You can put them all a a sub-directory or sub-folder on the mass storage drive. E.g., put it under the sub-folder "Other".    After you eject or unmount the E71 from your desktop, you need to install them individually on the phone, i.e., it does not do this automatically.    To install the .sis file, start the "File Manager" application (can be found under the "Office" folder. The file manager allows you to browser the storage, both phone and mass memory (use left/right to select), navigate to the "Other" folder where you put your .sis files.    Selecting (click) the file you wish to install will launch the installer.    p/s: Some .sis file are self signed and will not allowed to be install by default. To allow installation of self signed application, you need to disable the "install signed only" option in the "Application Manager" application settings.    Good luck and have fun.

w4I9oj2Maa	DON'T WORRY about it...    First, TV's are MORE COMPUTER than they are TV sets nowadays....    How many times have you had to RESTART a program, or even the whole computer to get it to work right ?    Well, that's your TV set acting like a computer...    And it doesn't happen often...it may happen once in a while, and it's usually due to a glitch caused by a finger spazz...or a poor UNTIGHT AC Power cord connection to the wall...OR if you have the SAMSUNG ANYNET connection between your SAMSUNG TV AND YOUR SAMSUNG DVD (only)  then it may have spazzed because the DVD was told to turn off, while the TV was told to stay on....    That happens if your remote doesn't get it''s signal to BOTH units at the same time.....    That's why I would worry...and you did the right thing, unplugging the power cord to reset both units.
oUjuw66uaa	I think you have some confusion in your terminology and what you are asking.  As noted, you need the converter box if you are using 'free', over the air signals for your TV and your TV doesn't have a digital tuner. You don't need a converter box if you have your TV hooked up to cable. However the converter box is NOT an HDTV converter, it simply allows you to capture an over the air digital signal and convert it to analog so your older TV set can display it. This is NOT an HD (high-definition) signal. Your cable provider IS capable of giving you an HD signal through the cable box (usually for an additional fee).  Hope that clears things up a bit...|`|vJwl2uoBaa	if you have cable, you don't need a converter box.  It is only for people with old tv's that get their reception through an antenna.|`|243cf04be15a2b663bfb5ba083f58c1eaa	If you have cable service right now you do not need a converter box to watch basic channels.  You do have to have a digital box if you want to subscribe to HD channels, HBO, Showtime etc...  But, most cable companies will require you to rent the box from them.  If their system is setup on a S.A. system you would need and S.A. box or motorola would need a motorola box and so on.  An HD box is several hundred bucks and if it goes out you would have to spend several more hundred to get another so renting is your best option even if you could buy one.  Those boxes are controlled by their head end so you probably have to get one from them.  Contact your cable provider and ask if you have questions because they are the only ones that will know their system.  Hope that helps ya.
R7vE8IwRaa	Yes. I've done the exact same thing and my case fits just perfectly. Actually I bought one specifically for the 8350i and it seems to fit the 8330 better so I think that they didn't even bother designing a new one and just relabeled it.

F9nDI2x6aa	Tough question, here is the deal, i owned first generation iPhone and still own a 3G iPhone, couple of months ago I bought T-Mobile`s G1 that runs Google Android.    To be perfectly honest, iPhone has more polished OS, it si fast, reliable, beautiful and really simple and useful. On the top of that it has Multi-Touch which is really cool and easy to use, and the best browser in the class. But,  Apple has locked the OS so in order to use it in its full potential you will need to jailbreak it. It has tons of cool and useful applications and flawless design and appearance. But, like I said there are quite a few limitations with the OS and the functionalitys ( no BT OBEX transfer, no sms delivery report, cant sync music except trough itunes.. etc etc)    Android on the other hand is super ppowerful, it has some really innovative and cool applications (geo aware wikipedia for instance , Locale ) and it is open source that means in the future there will be tons and tons of free and paid applications. But, G1 (at this time the only android phone (google phone) is ugly and badly build. It has slidable qwerty keyboard, but its sometimes really awkward to use, they both have similar HW specs with some minor differences. The Android is still flaky, slow, sometimres unresponsive and sometimes buggy. It will be one of the top mobile OS es in a year or two.     If i were you I would go for iPhone ( or wait for World Mobile Congress in Barcelona 16.Feb 2009 and see other Android devices that will be annnounced)|`|JPqFgjuiaa	If you're just interested in the apps you should get the iPhone but if you would be ok with an iPod touch and a regular cell phone this would be an much cheaper alternative.

If you're into RTS then I'm suggesting you wait for Starcraft 2 or Dawn of War 2. Also Bioshock is a great game. GTA 4 is out but also needs a pretty good comp and if you don't mind the maturity level then go get it. I suggest Fallout 3 since it takes ages to complete and the DLC just came out so you can survive longer in your class. Or if you want a fast past go pick up Mirror's Edge. So to shorten it I mostley recommend Fallout 3 or Mirror's Edge.|`|GcpLsdA2aa	Lol keyboard is far easier.  Fps: Cod4 or Cod5, Crysis (and Warhead)  Rts: Dawn of war series,Command and conquer series.  Sports: Grid and DiRt  Anyone is great :)
HBNx77BBaa	You don't have any direct control but you can influence the camera's decision by making use of the different scene modes. Try the different modes on the same view and then look at the exif data to see what shutter speed and aperture combination the camera used.    You can also exert some control by using exposure compensation.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	No. The DSC-W120 is a simple point & shoot camera which doesn't give you the option to manually adjust your shuuter speed and/or aperture.

And you should be fine, Hope this helps you.!!|`|HFuI8oVYaa	Lithium ion batteries are pretty easy to deal with. As others have said, charge it fully before using it. After that, keep it topped up. If you go out and shoot 50 pictures, give the battery a charge when you get back home. A Li-Ion battery will give you years of service. The Li-Ion battery in my camera is two years old (about 12,000 shots) and still going strong. I keep the battery topped up as much as possible in my camera and always make sure my batteries are fully charged before a picture taking session.    There is no need to go through silly antics with a Li-Ion battery unless you want to store it for a long period of time without using it. This discharging the battery fully stuff is not good advice as you may miss a wonderful photo opportunity with dead batteries, plus, it isn't necessary. Going through full cycle antics may give you a little edge, but it ain't worth it. Draining the battery down to zero is a really bad thing for all battery packs as you risk damaging one or more of the cells in the pack. Heat is also bad for batteries (e.g. don't leave it in a hot car). Since your battery charges in your camera, you may want to remove it a few times per year to wipe the contacts clean. This is allows you to inspect the battery for visible damage like leakage.|`|AvysJPnDaa	as above and discharge battery fully before recharging,     And keep using your camera on a regular basis ( like going to the Gym, Ya have to do it aleast a couple of time a week so the it won't fade away)

pG15wDfRaa	The sd card should still work with your phone except that your phone will only recognize 1gb of your card. If  you get lucky you'll be able to use the whole 2gb of your card but most likely, your phone will only recognize 1gb and you will only be able to use 1gb of your 2gb card which sucks. If I were you, I would just get a 1gb micro sd card because they are cheaper and since your only going to be able to use 1gb, might as well. Hope this helps

q3lzWKkXaa	The N73 runs on a Series60 operating software, which is a very advanced and multitasking software, that can run many applications and background and pop-up operations at the same time. So, this operating software require fast processor and high RAM (minimum requirements for good performance- 70 MB of RAM and 369 MHz processor). Unfortunately, the processor of N73 is too slow and the RAM is insufficient for multitasking. That's why, the processor and RAM is often overloaded and as a result it hangs. There's nothing you can do for this, but if you don't use too many programs at the same time, you might not face the problem. I recommend you to use a better task-manager like Handy Taskman and Jbak Taskman, which can show you the current status of your phone's RAM and allow you to manage active tasks. Handy Taskman can be downloaded from http://www.epocware.com , but it is not a freeware. So, you can download Jbak Taskman (for Symbian 9.x) from http://jbak.ru/jbaktaskman_en.php instead. Jbak Taskman is a freeware.  -  Many Nokia handsets have a Series60 operating software, so this is a common problem. For this reason, Nokia has recently started making handsets with faster processors and better RAM.|`|FKXG3IPiaa	check if it has the antivirus software , i suppose most new nokia phone have that feature.

It is maybe because of the corrupt memory card, your cellphone access your memory card from time to time to read or access some files, and when it is corrupted then the phone will wait for the memory card to respond but it can't (more like a PC with a corrupted harddisk).     Try to remove the memory card, and see if still hangs.  If it does not hang anymore, then it is really the memory card problem and you should just replace it with another.    If it still hangs, then you should bring it to the Nokia Care Center.

COh882Pxaa	The first thing I'd try is listening with another pair of headphones. Does it still sound bad just playing through the iPod's internal speaker, too?    Edit: That tells you that it's not the headphones and likely not the jack, at the very least.    If it's happening with all of your music, and the music plays fine through iTunes, I'd try resyncing your music first. If that doesn't help, maybe try restoring your iPod.|`|RMdfXuT0aa	Ok well you should try going to music in setting and changing the play settings to whateveer sounds better does this help?

c1Di5GrYaa	I've added my videos to the on-the-go, so if you're asking if it's possible to have videos in there, it's possible.  If you're asking if there's an on-the-go for just videos, I don't think so.  But I have made my on-the-go hold only videos, and go through and play them.  But keep in mind that if you play them from the list of songs, rather than the list of videos, they play as you hold the iPod normally, with the home key at the bottom, rather than holding it on its side. (Sorry, can't think of a better way to describe that, fried brain! haha)  I hope this helps :)

But if you play call of duty 4 or 5, and notice lag every game, then it would probably be your connection. Reason being that gow2 and r6v2 are games where you must connect to a "host" player that is randomly selected, thus if this host has a bad connection, then everybody is going to lag.

Solid state drives (SSD) have no mechanical parts and are more reliable. But most netbooks come in sizes ranging from 20GB to 60GB.

noU2uKEoaa	There could be a number of reasons for this.<br>  It's possible the phone is not reading the sim. Try sim in another compatible phone you know to be working. If this works then sim is fine. The phone you have purchased may still be locked into a different network from your sim. If this is the case then a network unlocking code will have to be requested from the network who originally supplied the phone. This would be charged for as you will be unable to prove when phone was originally purchased.<br>  The phone may simply be faulty.<br>  <br>  Finally, the phone may have been reported stolen and the IMEI blacklisted.You can check by calling customer services on your network and giving them the IMEI.<br>  This can be found by typing   *#06# into phone which will then display the 15 digit IMEI. This is a phone function, not a network command and should work on all mobile phones. The IMEI can also be found on a sticker inside the battery compartment.<br>  If the phone is barred I'm afraid there is little you can do as all UK operators co-operate with each other and no network will remove IMEI from the blacklist unless original proof of purchase can be provided.|`|AA10341358	Did you activate the sim?

t8SucbqFaa	Canceling your service and starting again with the same carrier is considered false churn and they will not let you start new service within 30 days if cancelling service. What you can do is upgrade your current account which is cheaper, instead of paying activation fees of $26-$36 per line you only have $18 upgrade fees per line.    If you cancel service you will either need to port your numbers to another carrier or lose your current numbers.     You will not be able to get these phones for free unless you go through a 3rd party like wirefly, letstalk, or amazon. The problem with this is they are 3rd party groups that make you sign a separate contract through them. Lets say they have you add a data plan for $30 to your line and a month later you don't want it. You will break their contract by removing the feature and be charged the full price for the phone. It is best to stick with buying from the carrier and pay the extra amount.

7Kxnf2w5aa	As far as I know, you cant do this. I'm pretty sure the console games don't mix with the PC games. Just imagine if you had to put up with someone using a mouse and keyboard in a shooting game while you had to use a controller.     However, if you could play together, then you could do it with a switch or router. If you don't have a switch or router, you can connect the ethernet cable directly between your PC and the Xbox then set your PC's IP address to something like 192.168.1.1 and the XBOX to 192.168.1.2 and the Gateway to 192.168.1.1 . If your PC has an auto-crossover capable ethernet card, you can use a regular ethernet cable. If not, you will need to use a crossover cable. If you dont have a crossover cable and cant find one to buy, you can make one out of a regular ethernet cable by splicing the wires together a different way. google search "how to make a crossover cable" for instructions.

fdd5c5b5d35c694b40560fd4c8109e54aa	Don't go for w580i, the phone is very weak...    Go for the K770i, the camera is superb and above average~  3.2mpix with flash and autofocus, its excellent for taking great quality pictures anytime... Like in public if you see a worth-wild image, with this camera phone you wont ever miss a chance like that.    Mind that K770i doesn't have the 850mhz frequency that at&t uses, so the signal is not that strong...    If you're with T-mobile it's perfect since they run on 1900mhz and the k770i is a triband    900  1800  1900    It's very popular in europe~ It's around 85 euros @ Vodafone.    2 megapixels suck! The pictures always end up very crappy.    The w580i is a quadband so no worries about signal, it does have megabass music player so your quality for music is excellent~ But I would maybe go for w910i, it's another popular handset in europe for around 90 euros.    Stay away from LG's and Samsungs unless they're the high-end stuff like Prada or Pixon. Their regular phones like the ones you get from at&t break really fast...    an LG has been just recalled in canada... It's been a while since they recalled any cellphones.    The 6300 Nokia is really average... it's your basic bar calling/ basic text phone... nothing special.      I would maybe suggest K550i/w600i/w810i of sony ericsson  They're not that new but they're sony phones with autofocus and flash LED, they're fairly cheap for sure that will probably fit your budget which is about under 200...     LG shine is okay too~ the slider one.     I would say for $120 you can't really get any decent phones... spend a few more maybe under 200... then use it for 2 years or so and then get a new one.|`|DWotzqlSaa	What about a Nokia 6300? They are awesome.    I don't like Sony, as you need to use a memory stick duo/pro to copy your data, and they suck (issues with compatibility). I could suggest a Samsung or LG, they are both good.

fp9bOiVFaa	The cheapest price I can find for the SX-1 is $600. eBay has Canon Rebel XTs with the 18-55mm going for as little as $300. Add a Canon EF-S 55-250mm lens for around $225 and a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 for $100 and you're coming out to pretty much the same price, except you have a DSLR with three good entry-level lenses.    The SX-1 is a good camera but I see no reason to get it when you can get a DSLR for the same price.

If you have that as an option on both ipods you can un-chek the music your mom doesn't want and check the music you do want.

AA11322322	Many dongles and modems have a little rubber plug that can be removed from the case to reveal a tiny coaxial socket.... This can be used to connect an external antenna!    You may be able to purchase a suitable antenna through a good car accessories shop, as they are usually used on vehicles!....  Through-glass coupled antennas are also available!    If you do not have a socket on your Dongle/modem, then you can improvise an antenna by winding some stiff copper wire (approx 6 turns spaced at about 5-6mm apart) and leave the end of the wire for a length of about 20-25cm pointing vertical...     You may need to experiment with the exact length depending on the turns you made.... so cut wire to a bit beyond 25mm and snip off with wire-cutters about 5mm at a time until best signal is obtained!    Hope this Helps!            `|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Actually yes - I have one iin the loft which has improved my signal dramatically.

Not all other controllers are compatible with current generation games.  Hope this helps.

j5Apt8hWaa	As a former wildlife photographer, I can tell you that either company makes excellent cameras and have the lenses that will support the needs of such a photographer.    NONE will make you into an African Wildlife photographer however.  That can only come from the necessary schooling in photography and many years working shooting animals in a controlled situation, so you can learn the animals behavior.    Then you can choose a nice Nikon like the D3 or Canon like the 1Ds, Mark III as well as the lenses you will need for shooting such animals.  At a minimum you will need a 400 mm f/2.8 and 600 mm f/4 lens to compliment the camera ... why such lenses?  1) most animals are out and about at dawn or dusk and most wild animals have a large scare radius, so getting close can be difficult and most of the time dangerous.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	you might want to read some photography books. canon 5D|`|jVe7NaEqaa	i just ordered a nikon 6.1 mp d40, one of the best beginners cameras out today. not too pricey either. if you're going to be shooting wild animals tho, you might want one of those telephoto long lens, the ones that give you good pictures without having to be close up.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would suggest Nikon D300

URncTuxxaa	The people who have GHWT havent played Rock band for very long have they?  Rock Band 2 is the best for younger people  and GH for older.   Just because GH has old songs I mean.    I like rock band a lot better because all of the songs are new and exciting and it doesnt have that "ugh I hate this song!" feeling everytime you play :P  The point of the game is to play the songs, and that's ruined if you don't like the songs.     Also, with rock band the game has more of a point. You use the money to make to personalize you character and band! This alone is why I chose RB.    The drums in GH are really no big deal.

127a78058a3f2d74d66572e17915dc80aa	You bill should not change since  you're getting an unlocked iPhone through an unauthorized seller, which means you will not have to sign up for a data plan. If you do want to sign up for a data plan, just add the cost of that plus taxes and surcharges to your current bill.    as for the unlocked verizon phone, the most probable answer is that you can't. GSM phones work when you insert a SIM card in them. Verison's technology is not SIM-dependent. The phones come programmed with the carrier data. Lately, though, I've that Verizon has released phone with SIM support for overseas travel. But other than that, you can't.    Good luck.|`|yv1ahRJ0aa	Well, the phone bill for the iPhone is around $80 to $100 base price. Whatever other features you want can affect the price greatly. Just make sure that you get the unlimited data plan or you could end up like the guy who had to pay nearly $5000 for a month of service. Hope this helps. Oh and using it on verizon is most likely a no because it is a strictly AT&T. But it may be available by around 2010 if you're willing to wait.

c203a90c14b101770dd33a82ba1bc9e7aa	You want to take the pictures in the internal memory to the memory card (assuming its already inside the camera).  Well, I think you must find a Menu Option where you can "copy" or "move" the pictures in the internal memory to the memory card. Usually digital cameras has this option, but name it in different ways.    A second option? Maybe less easy, you can plug your digital camera's transfer cable (USB), insert the memory card into a laptop and send the pictures from the camera to the memory card, at the end you take out the memory card and use it in your camera again.  I hope you got the idea.  Bye from Mexico.

HBNx77BBaa	You haven't given many details.    If the picture is there but just too bright there are several possibilities.    If it is very bright and you can only see blurred patches here and there you may have put the camera on fireworks mode by mistake.    If you are using the flash you may be standing too close to whatever you are taking pictures of.    If you are not using flash you may have exposure compensation selected. The camera will show something like +1 or +2 on the left side of the screen. On auto mode you can't do exposure compensation so this is only if the camera is on 'manual'.    Snow and beach scene modes could both cause the pictures to be over exposed if they are used for indoor scenes, though it would have to be quite bright indoors for this to happen.    If the pictures are completely white without any trace of a picture then I think the camera may be faulty and you would have to contact Canon if you want to get it repaired. Any repair would be expensive and unfortunately it might be better to get a new camera even though the A460 is not very old.    I hope you get the problem sorted out. Canon will have a help line and they may be able to suggest some other things that you could check.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	read the manual about white balance

chKSL0Ewaa	The battery on an OLD iPod shuffle (long, white, first version) costs $60, after asking an Apple associate. It will be cheaper for me to buy a new version iPod shuffle rather than try to replace the battery on my old one. I now own an iPod touch as well, noticing that the battery dies off much quicker than it did when I first bought it. This is because an iPod can only be charged so many times before the battery life dies down. With the iPod touch prices as low as they are now ($220), You'll be better off buying a new 2nd generation Touch rather than spending probably over $100 on a battery. To save battery life, dim down the backlight when you are playing on your touch at night (before you go to sleep etc.) ... do not have backlight as ALWAYS ON, and do not leave your iPod as charging when it is already fully charged. Also, if you has BOSS PREFS for a jailbroken iPod, be sure to turn OFF WI-FI, and SSH CLIENT when you are not using them. Those kill the battery tremendously.|`|1ykhOBLuaa	ask the apple store ppl|`|6621a0c207bb39a5161a464ebbaef97caa	I found one for $19 on allbatteryworld.com.   Check the link below
HBNx77BBaa	I think that they are generally good value for money. You can always argue that for a bit more money you can get something better but you have to draw the line somewhere.    You can't really look at all the Kodak models in one light. You have to look at a certain price range or a certain set of features and work out which camera manufacturer offers the best value. Some Kodak models are a little out of their depth in their price band while others, particularly at the lower cost end are winners.    You might like to have a look at this review of several lower cost cameras. I think the price of some of these will be well above the price you are wanting to pay, but you will be able to see how the brands compare, including Kodak. In this review the Kodak under test, the C1013, did not do particularly well.    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q408budg...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	hahaahahahaha, get a canon|`|9OMEGZiZaa	no, they suck.  trust me and spend a bit more on the canon elph powershot series cameras.|`|AA10958614	Kodak makes mediocre cameras at mediocre prices. It's a middle of the road brand. If you want great pictures, easy operation and use, go with Canon or Sony. Canon are more heavily discounted and there are a multitude of models to choose from. Decide the zoom (1:4 is typical), Megapixels (8 or higher) and other features you want, then pick the model that has them. Be aware that going to higher zoom may cause more "shake" in your pictures. Most of the top cameras have Image Stablization ( a must have) and facial recognition (great for family shots). Higher megapixels may cause higher drain on the battery and slow  shutter speed or flash recycle. If you want a nice pocket camera consider the SD 1000 or 1100 ELPH line. While replaceable AAA bateries are convenient, You get longer use out of the brand rechargeable Li-ion. Look for sales on the popular models. Don't over-buy! A $2000 nikon is overkill for family vacations and will break just as easy as a $200 Canon Elph. All brands have problems. Check your pick out on CNET.com before you buy.

xTioPxaVaa	Since the problem has been there with the headset and the mic, it's pointing to the soundcard itself.    Depending on how the adapter is wired, your ground connection could be floating.  That would cause a lot of buzz.  Best to get a mono-to-mono adapter.    My bet is that the ground connection on the sound card is compromised.  If you can, try the mic on a friend's computer and see if the buzz is still there.    Greetings from Austin, TX    Ken|`|JuHpVfUBaa	The PCB mounted 1/8" input jack on your motherboard may have lost it's shield connection and could be repaired simply by resoldering it. but that means dismantling your laptop to access the motherboard.      For good quality recording it is better to use USB microphone rather than using the microphone socket which often gives noisy recordings.  The other point to consider is that the Mic input is designed for an electret condenser mic and feeds power to the mic on one of the jack pins.      A dynamic mic is not really suitable for direct connection to the Mic input because it's output is much lower compared to an electret mic.      The recommended method is to use a Mic preamp or small audio mixer and plug it's output into the laptop.  If your laptop needs repairing the quickest and easiest thing to do is go out and buy a USB Mic and you should be good to go.    Here's one that I just bought recently   http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam...    cheers,    Sound Man

fwdsp3dVaa	I would go here for the differences between 1080i & 1080p:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080i    If you set your x-box to 1080p, your TV has to downscale it to 720p which will degrade the image. Set your x-box to 720p and you should get the best image. If you set it to 1080i, you may notice slight blurring or juddering when viewing fast motion content. This is because the signal is being interlaced(every other line) instead of progressively(one by one) scanned!    The best website to go to for unbiased HDTV lingo & technolgy is CNET!|`|qHEpR92Gaa	1080p is the shorthand name for a category of HDTV video modes. The number "1080" represents 1,080 lines of vertical resolution (1080 horizontal scan lines),[1] while the letter p stands for progressive scan (meaning the image is not interlaced). 1080p can be referred to as full HD or full high definition to differentiate it from other HDTV video modes.[2] The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels. This creates a frame resolution of 19201080, or 2,073,600 pixels in total. The frame rate in hertz can be either implied by the context or specified after the letter p (or i), such as 1080p30, meaning 30 Hz.    1080p is sometimes referred to in marketing materials as "Complete High-Definition". However, 2K/4K digital cinema technology is commercially available, and ultra-high definition video is in the research phase.    In addition to the meaning of 1080p as a display resolution, 1080p is also used to describe video equipment capabilities. Use of 1080p and the closely related 1080i labels in consumer products may refer to a range of capabilities. For example, video equipment that upscales to 1080p takes lower resolution material and reformats it for a higher resolution display. The image that results is different from the display of original 1080p source material on a native 1080p capable-display. Similarly, equipment capable of displaying both 720p and 1080i may in fact not have the capability to display 1080p or 1080i material at full resolution. It is common for this material to be downscaled to the native capability of the equipment. The term "native 1080p-capable" is sometimes used to refer to equipment capable of rendering 1080p fully.    1000/1001-rate slow versions (e.g., 29.97 frames per second instead of 30). Higher frame rates, such as 1080p50 and 1080p60, could only be sent with more bandwidth or if a more advanced codec (such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and AVS) were used. Higher frame rates such as 1080p50 and 1080p60 are foreseen as the future broadcasting standard for production.[3]    In the United States, the ATSC is considering amending its standard to allow the incorporation of the newer codecs for optional usage like the DVB Project consortium already has done with DVB-S2.[4] However, doing so is not expected to result in widespread consumer availability of broadcast 1080p60 programming, since most of the existing digital television sets or external digital receivers in use in the United States would still only be capable of decoding the older, less-efficient MPEG-2 codec, while the bandwidth limitations do not allow for broadcasting two simultaneous streams on the same broadcast channel (e.g. both a 1080i MPEG-2 stream alongside a 1080p MPEG-4 stream).      [edit] Production standards  The movie industry has embraced 1080p24 as a mastering format in both native 24p form and in 24PsF form. This may be the first universal video standard which transcends continental boundaries. This is an area previously reserved for film.[5]    A new high-definition progressive scan format is not available for picture creation, but is currently being developed to operate at 1080p at 50 or 60 frames per second.[3][6] This format will require a whole new range of studio equipment including cameras, storage, edit and contribution links (such as 3G-SDI) as it has doubled the data rate of current 50 or 60 fields interlaced 1920  1080 from 1.485 Gbit/s to nominally 3 Gbit/s. It is unable to be broadcast in a compressed transmission to legacy MPEG-2 based HD receivers. This format will improve final pictures because of the benefits of "oversampling" and removal of interlacing artifacts.      [edit] Availability   This section does not cite any references or sources.  Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unverifiable material may be challenged and removed. (March 2008)       [edit] Broadcasts  In the United States, the ATSC standard allows 1080p24 and 1080p30 video. In practice, all major networks use a 60 Hz format in the MPEG-2 header  either 720p60 or 1080i60. But that only dictates the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process, not the actual means of encoding the frames.    For material that originated from a 24 frame/s source (such as film), MPEG-2 allows the video to be coded as 1080p24, irrespective of the final output format. The progressively-coded frames are then tagged with metadata (literally, fields of the PICTURE header) instructing a decoder how to perform a 3:2 pulldown to interlace them. While the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process from such stations is 1080i60, the actual content is coded as 1080p24 and can be viewed as such.

If you try to display 1080P on a 720p screen, it won't work and it could possibly damage your tv even though it is unlikely. Your TV wont be able to use the 1080P signal.  1080p does look a lot better than 720p though, especially on a larger TV. Your TV may be able to take a 1080i signal, but it would simply scale it to 720p.
uu8qQwWpaa	Magic Jack is a somewhat unreliable VOIP service. I have heard all the horror stories of cut-offs, service unavailable, unreliable or no incoming calls, echo, etc. They run their own network, which is not nearly as reliable as a good VOIP service like Comcast, Vonage, etc. You, of course must have the computer on to use it, and if you lose power, you cannot use your computer or Magic jack.. It also requires a fairly fast Broadband internet connection to work properly. As for power losses, several providers like FIOS, or a hard wired landline will still work.!!  I do not even consider a cell phone a 'reliable' service, as it may have a dead battery, or the cell site may have lost power, or you may be in a poor reception area..!!|`|AA10413444	Yes I have one and love it.

What I believe is the case with Magic Jack is that it only works if your computer is on and connected to the internet.  It makes me fear that it's not as reliable as other VoIP options.  I've been looking into Ooma and Vonage.  I'm not sure what we're going to do yet though.
iheRlxhdaa	BS. Bluetooth headsets actually help cut down the amount of radiation directed to the head, versus just holding the cellphone next to your ear.      The reason you don't see MANY doctors using it would be because of strict cellphone rules in the hospitals, where they must turn off or store their phones in certain places as to not interfere with people's pacemaker and life-saving machines.      Also, it would be quite inappropriate if the doctor that told you your child just died and he had a flashing bluetooth in their ear.  Morals I guess.    It hasn't been proven that cellphones directly cause cancer.  Think about it.  CNN and all the other huge new people would be all over it.  The risk is very low.|`|GBC39wHAaa	The cellular phone has to emit radiofrequency energy at levels high enough to reach base stations (antenna towers) tens of kilometers away.    Since the energy is emitted as a microwave ... there are concerns about the safety of this technology.    There are reports from cell studies as well as animal studies that are most worrying.    Among other effects the double DNA breakage is among the fundamental och disturbing findings.    This may indicate that there may be a significant risk of developing cancer tumours, foremost brain tumours in the user of cellular (mobile) phones.    The design of the cellular phones casing, electronic and foremost the antenna construction gives widely different near and far fields around the phone.    It is at present time not completely clear what parameters of the field gives biological effects, however as an intermediate cautionary step one can use the simple measure of absorbed radiated energy into the tissue of the head.    This is given as a SAR - Specific Absorption Ratio and is measured in watts per kilogram. This may not be a true measure of the biological hazard from the phone but may be used as an indication of the energy recieved into the head. See it as prudent avoidance.    Niels Kuster, a radiation expert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, has developed a new measurement technique to measure cell-phone EMR towards the user's head. He measured 16 popular cell phone models, and published the results in the Swiss Consumer Report magazine. The table below was initiated based upon data from his study:    (see site for ratings - http://www.bemi.se/founder/clips/cellula... )    SAR is given as Cenelec value for average EMR exposure of user's head, measured in Watt per kg of user's body weight. (A low number means less radiated energy into the users head).    The fact that Ericsson SH888 is given two different SAR values  reflects the uncertainty how SAR should be measured.    The same radiation will give different SAR values  depending on calculation or measurement method,  whether the ear is a loss one or just a distance,  and if the SAR is calculated over 1 g, 10 g or 1 kg of tissue  (and also the shape that region is given, eg. a cube).    Note that Star Tac exists in various models, some have low SAR and some don?t. Also note that despite the low SAR for Star Tac many people complain of headaches or other symptoms when using those  (just another indication that SAR may NOT be the best way of describing health effects from cellular phones).    ( comment from submitter: SAR is one factor, and likely,  use of ear pieces, and length of exposure, and power output of phone to reach the nearest tower, are the other important factors. )    So to answer your question the answer is; Yes, it can possibly give you cancer with long term exposure.

You'll need to upgrade to HD cable to get an HD picture. From there you will use HDMI or component cables to carry the signal from your HD cable box to the TV. You will never use your digital tuner if you pay for your TV service.    And no, you don't need the converter. The converter is only for people that have TVs without a digital (ATSC) tuner, and that get their signals over the air. If you purchased a digital converter, you'd just be buying something your TV already has.|`|1d193a581f413c8f01296a8f36389636aa	Your Sony HDTV comes with a built in HD Tuner.  You do not need to purchase any digital converter box to receive your local channels.  All you need on your new Sony HDTV is a good indoor or outdoor antenna and hook it on back to your television.  You should then receive all your local channels for free.  You have to go to your television menu setup and scan your channels once you hook your antenna to your television.  Your local channels should be more clear and resolutions should be around 720p with a good antenna.    However if you want more programming in channels and selection then you can subscribe to cable services.  They offer more channels in high definition.  Of course this will cost you monthly fees.  They will provide you with their own cable box.    So it depends if you just want free local channels through your antenna or you want a variety of programming through your cable services with monthly fees.  You do not need to purchase any digital converter box.|`|rHhtn7plaa	i have a hdtv i just got my box through cable company the channels are alittle blurry when there not hd in hd they are clearer you can tell the difference

Are you using a PC or a Mac?  Do you want to copy songs from one folder to another on the same computer?    If you are using a PC and you want to move music to a different folder on the same computer do the following:    First, open your "My Music" folder.  If you have XP this is in "My Documents".  If you have VISTA this is in your user file.    Open the folder titled "iTunes" and then open the folder titled "iTunes Music".  In here you will find the music that is in iTunes.    Next click on the folder you want to move and then right-click and choose copy.    Go to the folder in which you wish to place the folder and right-click and choose paste.    You can also use CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste.    I hope this helps.
joQ6cZ5Maa	This should be in PC Security but...oh well.    You were either hijacked or have a virus or both. The first thing is to get your computer checked for viruses. There are many viruses that can hide from anti-virus programs, especially if the program was free. If your anti-virus was a downloaded free one, I would recommend buying a anti-virus as there is usually a reason that something is free, and it is never good. You can do this or take it to a tech, virus scans should not cost more that $50-75.     After the computer is good, then it is time to change your account password on AOL. Next is the important step, do not run your computer on the admin account unless you need to install an item. Use an account on your computer that can not install. This little trick can prevent many viruses and malware from infecting your computer.     Good Luck|`|PIraq2b9aa	You prob got keylogged..

If you can't, be sure to update the definitions in your spyware program, or try getting a highly recommended spyware program.
HBNx77BBaa	It sounds like the white balance is incorrectly set. Have a look in the menu for the white balance setting and check that it is set to 'auto'.    If it is already on auto then you may have to play around with the fixed white balance settings. The GX8 has a couple of flexible white balance features. The first is 'one push', which I think will prompt you to press the shutter to calibrate the white balance. The other is 'white balance bracketing' which should let you select from images processed using different white balance settings.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:    Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.    However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.    However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak.     A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).    Don't worry too much about megapixels. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels , i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.    Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature.   Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .      The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about basic photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.    For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...    The "perfect clarity" is up to you. If you know what you're doing, you'll get clear photos.|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.    Good luck!

Sorry but you'll have to get up there.|`|d9fe0b4cac101ad13733ed5b5c28b3beaa	The satellite dish may have been moved a little bit therefore no longer getting the signal from the satellite. Climb on the roof and check it out.|`|54ef14aee629dde270e28b8db2534f5daa	maybe not the answer to your problem,without hands on sight cant tell,  my satellite dish had connecting wires to the box which entered the dish horizontally,and whenever we had rain and bad weather the signal was "lost" i had to get a replacement dish when i upgraded to Sky Plus and on this dish the wires enter vertically from below and hence were not being constantly saturated with water and i have had no trouble with the signal since,hope you solve the problem

loSG0rTxaa	The iPod headphones aren't great so I wouldn't expect them to last long term. I've never heard of the apple retail store doing that, but you can try. I would just bring a reciept or something just in case.|`|Vxx95wxAaa	I recommend getting new headphones.  It's not worth your time and effort to get them to exchanged when they will just break in 6 months time again (if not sooner).  I use a $14.00 Sony pair and they work fine.  As for the answer about if they will exchange them for you?  Well I'm not sure about in an actual store but if you send them to them by mail you will get a new pair (My friend got her pair replaced).  But honestly, probably not worth your time.  :D|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	I don't think that's true.  I've always hated Apple headphones; they hurt my ears.  Phillips "virtual surround sound" headphones (about 20 bucks) are excellent and have amazing sound quality.|`|HDS268fOaa	not true|`|x5ygIz3oaa	i really hope so. if they do will ya tell me? im gettin mine really soon and if that happens i wanna kno what to do

3TqPF1zMaa	The reason you bought an SLR camera was for its ability to use interchangable lenses. Not to screw cheap toys onto the end of it.    If budget is a concern, consider renting lenses. A Yahoo search for "lens rentals" will find several online companies who rent lenses through the mail.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com/ in Canada.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	limited use, save your money|`|pZGLhV2Waa	They pretty much all suck. Unless you are using a real fisheye lens. There is little difference with these screw on adapters. All of them have very poor optical quality and will seriously degrade your image quality.       That said they wont hurt your camera so go ahead and play around. When looking for one just find one that is the same size as the threads on your lens. If you have the kit lens it should be 52mm. Make sure the one you choose is a fisheye and not just a wide angle adapter. All fisheyes are wide angle but not all wide angles are fisheye. Keep in mind that your autofocus wont work properly with these on.

ec876298f79d2c839e85e03a4b74b2c7aa	Ive got one on contract from O2 and its 40pound a month, its a sat nav version and i get 1000 texts, 600 Min's talk time and 600 Min's internet time for that, its good as E:Mail is free and so is instant messenger.. but my phone the curve could be better, it don't take videos, bluetooth is a nightmare, it freezes up quite a few times too, the only good things are its music player and inbuilt speaker are good, and it takes a decent photo and the keyboard is good to use too, it has lots of other features too but im sure there must be better phones out there for the money, when my contract is up i will choose an iPhone as they look much better !.  Hope this helps a little ?? :-)|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	varies abit.. dont get them there rubbish!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	300 pounds|`|g5000MHBaa	130 but if u go on contract it will be better, the phone aint all dat anyway, but if u like it u should get it|`|8ORwpuTuaa	About 160.    Contract appears to be a better deal than pay as you go as you can sometimes get the  phone free e.g. the 8900 Javelin.    Online have good deals but from experience  I  find it better to go into a Mobile phone store (most high streets  have them) and compare deals and prices.   It appears that the longer contracts offer free phones.
Cvcklfddaa	Maybe your hearing's going    Don't bother with the iPod headphones, get a pair of Sony ones    I bought one pair of iPod headphones for 20 a while ago and they broke very soon after and because I was a bit skint at the time, I just bought a pair of cheapy Sony ones for a fiver and they've lasted me much longer and actually have better sound quality    Hope this helps|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	you can get new ones at the apple store for 19.58 or go and see them at the store and see if they can fix them|`|eLjcGsHcaa	i dont think they can get fixed. you might need a new pair. =(
tWoN22rRaa	I and thousands of other photographers can tell you from *personal experience* that yes, dust does in fact get on the sensor. Dust gets in the mirror chamber when you take the lens off (and sometimes even when its left on... some lenses produce a significant air flow while in motion), and then is attracted to the sensor when it's active. So it doesn't matter if the camera is off when the lens is changed.    Fortunately it doesn't always happen, and setting the camera to cleaning mode and giving it a quick burst or two from a bulb blower will solve the problem most of the time.

qGfAlDd2aa	"If you cannot remember your PIN code    While the PIN code entering screen is displayed, press [RECALL] four times within five seconds.  The PIN code will be cleared and you can enter a new PIN code."|`|qHEpR92Gaa	1Turn on the TV and grab the remote. In most cases, you will need the original remote to unlock the TV if you aren't sure of the unlock code. If you don't have the original remote, you will need to purchase one.   Step2Look at the screen. If you see a blank screen with a red key on the bottom of the screen, press 'Function' and 'Mute' at the same time. This should unlock the channel. This is an option for people who want the TV to stay locked but, want to be able to bypass the lock to watch a certain show or channel. All other channels will remain locked and the TV will fully lock when it is turned off.   Step3Unlock all of the channels on the TV by entering the factory reset code. There are three main reset codes that TV manufacturers set. These are 0711, 6688 and 3308. Try each one until you find the one that works. This will reset the TV to original factory settings. When you do this, you will loose any information that you have stored in the TV, such as favorite channels, automatic timers and the clock. You will have to go through the full initial set up.   Step4Call the technical support service number in your owner's manual if none of those codes work. A technician can help you troubleshoot the television because the problem may not be the locking control. When you call, make sure that you have the model number and serial number of the TV.   Step5Take your television to a TV repair shop. In some cases, a professional who access to wiring diagrams for your television set may have to rewire certain components in order for the television to unlock. This is usually the case when the TV locks by itself while it is on.|`|AA10645224	TRY TOSHIBA .COM    IF UNPLUGGING IT DOESN'T WORK

qIR9DB9Haa	You have a few choices: Gadget Infinity triggers, very cheap; cybersync trigggers, my favorite; skyports; and pocket wizards very expensive. You will need one trigger and one receiver so for the cybersyncs and skyports that means about $140. GI triggers are like $40 total but you get what you pay for. The you will need this http://flashzebra.com/hotshoes-shoes/006... which will connect the receiver to your flash (the cord you need should come with the triggers if you get good ones like cybersyncs, skyports, PW's).
