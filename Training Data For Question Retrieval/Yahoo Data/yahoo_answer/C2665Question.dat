20090203074012AAPJ1f8	Pets;Dogs	Could vaccinating cause liver problems in Dogs?	I have a little shih tzu poodle mix who's a little over a year (15 months as of Jan 7th). At her first vet visit, she was proclaimed healthy and  she had all of her first shots ... yet a couple of months later when she was in for her preop (spay) blood work, the doctor says that her alt levels were through the roof, consecuitive blood tests show no decrease. So i'm wondering, as she's on the go constantly, is a finicky eater (but so are our other dogs) and is showing no symptoms of liver disease (gum/skin color, no pain) is it possible that her vaccinations did something to her liver?

All of a sudden, he starts peeing and pooping everywhere!  We can't stop him, he isn't marking with his pee, he is PEEING, like crazy!  He is a year old, and was rescued.  We don't know why he's doing this, is it a prostate issue?  If we don't get him housebroken as soon as possible, my Mom might take him to the pound, and I love my puppy too much to let that happen.  Just like my dog peeing like crazy, I have been researching, and I found this system that worked with us before, when we lived in NJ, but we cannot put the pad outside anymore, since we live in NY now, and it's not right.  Don't know what I'm talking about?  First take the pad and have him pee on it, next time  you take your dog out for a walk, put down the pad on the grass, and he will learn to pee there.  That's what we did with him, but now we live in the city.  I need help, please.  Please, I am seriously desperate, drowning in my tears BEGGING my mom not to take him away from me.  HELP!!! Please...

20090220161625AAmvsKn	Pets;Birds	What mutation and gender is my cockatiel?	I bought this cockatiel today.  I believe it is a female whiteface split to pied.  She looks like a whiteface with no white cheekpatches.  The puzzling part is the back of her head and some of the shorter crest feathers have white (randomly like a pied).  I read that some birds that are split to pied will have spots on the back of the head.  My main question is "Is it male or female?" and "If it's not whiteface split to pied, what is it?"

I am little bit worried about my Syrian Hamster Coco,   I got him on the 11th june 08 so he isn't really that old, i just noticed that on his back near to the end of his bum he has got dried skin (like dandruff that humans get) should i be worried about him?    He is still eating and drinking and still very lively and runs about in him ball like mad! when i touch the bits that are are like what i said coco doesn't seem to be bothered and doesn't flinch at all, the skin is not red and inflamed just normal like the rest of him, i watched him quite a bit tonight when he is in his ball to see if he scratches himself, and he just seems to be running about like mad and then stops the grooms for about a minute then starts running again.    I told my dad and he said if it does get worse then we would take him to the vet and see what they say. so im keeping a close eye on him and just looking to see anything that's abnormal, and if there is he will be down the vet!    So should i be worried??   also i brought him when he was i think 6-7weeks old.      Thank you to people who answers i really do thank you!!   Hannah xx

We had to move to town home because we  got this huge dog- Black Russian Terrier...    http://www.mistylakespetresort.com/image...       See link above , if you  don't know this breed. After I had my baby I started to hate him. He is the sweetest, smartest dog that exists. But he  has so much hair, I have to wash floors all the time, his hair on baby clothes, in the laundry. 1st year was total mess because he would have  very weak stomach, so if he would eat somthing wrong he would throw up all over the house or  have diarhia... so I was the one who end up cleaning it all the time... I am so sick of it!      Now, I come home every day and he destroys something, 1st he was destroying my baby's toys, and now he destroyed that thing  in the play yard where u hand baby's toys... what the heck, seriously?         My husband is in love with him, but I hate him... How do you live with our pets? Any  problems?      Can any one suggest something?

Details:   It's been about 3 months, he's not moved from the corner of the cage, he's not eaten or drank anything either. When you pick him up, he doesn't fall out of his shell and his legs are still a nice reddish-brown color. Also, his legs feel very stiff, like they would break really easily. All signs point to him being dead....but when crabs die, don't they start to smell fishy or lose their color..? (there's no smell at all)      Any ideas/suggestions? Thanks!

20090220162258AA4wxcU	Pets;Dogs	What to do about a friend that is neglecting her dog?	A friend of mine has a large dog with a split nail. It is a pit-bull and she loves to run round and play outside. The dog was running and jumping around and split her nail. The nail split on the right and left side, almost up to where it begins. You can actually look into the front of the nail and see inside. I feel absolutely horribly for this dog.  At first the nail was bleeding, but has now stopped but is obviously still painful and keeps splitting more and more. It has been over a week and she has still not taken dog to the vet! I know my friend does not have the money right now.  She has just lost her job and is staying with me until she gets on her feet. I offered to pay for the dogs vet bill, and told her that she did not even need to pay me back. She refused my offer and I think that I might have offended her. The dog keeps licking her wound and her paw is red and irritated. Also, her dogs ear were very dirty. My friend was gone visiting her parents so I thought it would be a good time to clean the dogs ears. They were so nasty! There was lots of hair build up, a foul odor, the poor dogs ears were so irritated! I cleaned them and now they are healthy and fresh.       I do not think that she deserves this dog at all and am getting more and more irritated with every day that passes. I made a vet appointment and I will be taking the dog in to the vet tomorrow! I know that I am doing the right thing, but what can I tell my friend? She is never around and does not even walk the dog. I have dogs of my own and a large fenced in yard and would like to keep her… what can I do??

Also like those little flower like things with the leather strings have mostly fallen off, how much will it cost to replace all of these?

20070505072827AAYu87H	Pets;Other - Pets	Is it my fault?	I got this little squirrel a while ago, maybe not a baby, but young.  It's not like i trapped it, it followed me and crawled all over me, so i took her home. I let her outside for about a half hour everyday and she would always come back. Yesterday i let her out and took my dogs for a walk, but when i came back i couldn't find her. I figured she just decided it was time too leave. But this morning i found her dead in the backyard, the ******* cat killed it. Everyone says it's my fault and i shouldn't have left it outside. I can't seem to get over it.

20070818181843AAsrNZX	Pets;Other - Pets	Horse medical question. Please help!?	My boyfriend has a horse that got hit by a bull and the horn punctured the skin on the inside of one of her legs. Not deep but enough to make her walk with uncomfort. We couldnt afford to take her to the vet but they have been around horses forever, they have done what they know to do. The leg eventually got swollen and it got so swollen that it slit a hole on the skin and that relieved that pressure. With pinicilin and pain killers, it got better. Hwver, now the other leg has gotten swollen. We dont know why and it makes me sad to see the horse in this condition. I dont know if she's in pain but I want her to get better. She's so nice and noble. Does anybody know what we can do to help her. We cant afford to take her to the vet. Will the infection go away with the pinicilin?

Chester, né le 15 juillet, est arrivé à la maison le 17 Ao?t, ses maitres n'en voulant plus car soi disant une portée de 5 chatons leur revenait trop cher !! Bref j'ai déjà un gros matou, Baloo, agé de presque 15 mois et au bout d'une semaine il continue à grogner et à pschitter ce petit chaton. Combien de temps pensez-vous qu'il mettra à "accepter" ce nouvel arrivant ou à ne plus lui pschitter dessus.   En fait, Baloo est très intrigué par le chaton, il le suit du regard sans arrêt, va le renifler quand il dort dans son panier pour le pschitter. Il lui a même donner un coup de patte, heureusement sans sortir les griffes, mais comme il est énorme et pèse un peu plus de 6 kilos, j'ai peur que sans le vouloir il assome Chester qui lui ne fait que 380 grammes!

Here's the product:  http://www.petco.com/Shop/petco_Product_...       I was wondering if anyone has any feedback on the product? The reviews on the website are great, but wanted to get more opinions. Yes, I know, Huskies are a shedding breed, but with the right amount of omega 3's and fatty acids, the shedding can be minimal to nothing between the 2 times a year they blow their down coat. My Husky sheds an awful lot in between, I really can't tell the difference when he is blowing his coat or not. I'm trying everything I can. He eats Natural Balance, and I'm switching him to the Sweet Potato & Fish formula within the next week because that formula is more aimed towards a healthy coat. Also have an undercoat rake and I have to get him groomed to get all the excess out. This is going to be my last option, so has anyone ever used the product (especially Sibe owners)?

He has nevre done this for over a day. It's been a total of atleast 3 days. His twin brother, sister, and other two brothers(dogs) are really sad. Espically Logan(his twin). We have put up flyers, posted on Craigslist, Petfinder, and Pet911.com we even called the animal shelter and asked if they brought in/picked up a cat that matched his description, they said they brought in one ran over cat that matched it apparently. We do not think it was him as he doesn't go far from home, the place where that cat got ran over was a LONG two blocks. We have only known him to stay in our yard, on-top of roof(house), and in the grassy field(behind our house) and we think if he did go past that, not all the way to a busy road. He is fairly young & fast so even if he did(which we doubt he did) I'd think he could get away.    Any suggestions? I have aniexty,depression,ocd&hewasmy...

20070404074434AA9SUOs	Pets;Cats	Will a cat call as a result of a new dog in the house?	I have a cat who is almost 2 years old.  She's been spayed for over a year.  I also have a dog who just entered our household a few months ago.  Now that the cat and dog can stand to be around each other, my cat is sometimes peeing where the dog has made her mistakes, and wandering the house calling out all night long, as though she's in heat.  By the way, at night the dog is not out with the cat, but in the bedroom with us (the only way we can all sleep peacefully).  Does the dog have anything to do with the cat acting that way, or is it hormonal?

20070506234710AAJSr0O	Pets;Other - Pets	I want to train horses!!!?	I have been contacting trainers to see if any are accepting apprentices, without much luck. I finally found one who is, and I need to write up a resume. I have written resumes before, but never for something like this (and never for something this important to me). What should the resume contain. To be honest I'm 22 and my experience with horses isn't that extensive. My parents bought a mustang when I was younger, but we had to get rid of her due to a move. In high school I volunteered in a therapeutic horsemanship program, but we had little to do with the horses other than leading them around. I moved back home and for the past few months I've spent a lot of time with my parents horses. (feeding, riding, and some groundwork) and I've come to realize that this is something I really enjoy and would like to turn it into a career. The only training experience I have is from watching RFD and Clinton Anderson's Gaining respect and control on the ground 1,2, & 3, and Riding with confidence 1, 2, & 3. It seems like a lot of trainers want apprentices that have been around horses all their lives, are already trainers, and have shown horses. Can this be worked around or did I strike out. Thanks for taking the time to read this, any help is very appreciated.

My mom adores kittens and i guess they are pretty cute, but my sister was really lookin forward to the puppy, and we have researched a lot about it as well.  As for my dad, he doesnt really want part in this cuz he dislikes animals, but my mom says that a cat will not put him down as much as a dog will, because of the barking and accidents and stuff like that.  I am not sure if a cat will be as fun or nice or affectionate as a dog.  right now i am 60% dog and 40% cat.  School is coming up as well, and my mom says a puppy will be a big responsibility added to the usual hours of homework.  A cat seems so much easier, but will it be as enjoyable in the end as a dog???  HELP PLEASE!

20081026032547AAb2VBt	Pets;Horses	Excluding clothing, how much do shows cost?	Ok, well let me explain first. This upcoming year (2009) I'm finally getting a job. I'm finally old enough, know a place that is good to work at, and I'm willing to work. Anyways, In about 11 months (I want to get a horse in december since it's my birthday month, christmas, and new years. i know, i know, it's busy and i shouldn't but i'd really love for me to get my horse around my bday) I will have enough to pay for my horse, pay for all front-up costs, pay for the first month of board, and put $1000 into savings for all future reference. (if my horse gets sick and what not). There's also a side-savings set up for all farrier fees and regular de-worming, shots, etc.      I have this really planned out (it's not even funny lol) and I've come to realize, I only have about $200 left over for me to use anything for showing!       Now, I plan on training my horse myself and learning many different disciplines on him, so I won't have a trainer, I won't be having lessons, and I will only be going to local shows, mainly small ones but a few big ones here and there.      So for one show, how much is it? That includes the body clipping, renting a trailer, show entry fees, and any other fees. I know it's hard to actually determine since everywhere is different as well as shows, but in the US what's a rough estimate for small-medium shows??      -body clipping and trailer renting shouldn't vary too much, i would just like to know what you pay in small show fees-      Thanks!!      Oh, and if it helps I'll be doing most likely reining, western pleasure, hunt seat equisiton, and hunters. :]

I'm needing to know "Will it be too late/much harder to tame them after they're totally independent(eating solid foods)?"   Their eye's aren't open yet, I'd say they are around 4 weeks of age.

20081209103108AAL6TUB	Pets;Horses	To blanket or not to blanket?	The gist of this question is- should I blanket our 8mo. old weanling?      It is 25* out, but "feels like" 15* with the wind chill.   It is starting to snow.   He hasn' been blanketed before, except for a chilly trailer ride home, so he has a good deal of fuzz on him (but I wouldn't call him super-fluffy, like ponies tend to get).   He also has a shelter, but seems to prefer not standing in it.   He's 15hh and around 600 pounds (so a bit ribby, but the breeder told us to keep him that way as a baby to prevent leg strain).      He has seemed to be fine so far this year, but this morning when my bf went out, he said his body overall and particuarly his ears felt colder than usual.      If we blanket him now, will it affect his ability to grow a winter coat later in life? (Even if he has a head start on growing the coat?)   What weight turnout blanket would be good in this situation? (I was thinking medium?)   Can you point me toward some fairly inexpensive, durable brands with pony sizes? I know he will need a small size this winter, but I don't want to spend a ton if we get a blanket because he will surely outgrow it.

The dog, Toby n ever made messes in the house, no matter how long he was left. mY boyfriend and i split up back in september. MY ex wasn't close with Toby so he didn't really notice he was  gone.

I walk him right before bed and he never has to wait to go back out again for more than six hours (most of which he is asleep) What can i do to stop his mess making. my new man and toby don't have problems with each other and spend all day together.

20081026081223AA9faUk	Pets;Horses	Re-training an ex-race horse ?	I'm interested in purchasing a 5 year old AQHA gelding, who just finished his racing career, apparently he made about $40,000 dollars in his career. Anyways I want to re-train him to barrel race. I've worked with difficult horses before, but I was just wondering if re-training ex-race horses is extra difficult to do?   And does anyone know what race horses are taught to do besides run? Do they know leads, collection, ground work, etc?   -Thanks in advance!
20081026002725AAOWDEf	Pets;Horses	Am I a bad person/horsewoman?	So I've created a secret identity on here. Most of you would recognize me from all my posts and it's a tad embarrassing. Anyway, here it goes.         So I went to my lesson the other day and everyone knows I'm adamant about tacking my own horse. However it just so happened I was called out to help a younger girl tack up for her private lesson that was running the same time as mine.      So this snooty stable hand girl, whom I don't get along with, decided to do the job for me even though she knows how I feel. By the time I rushed back, he was all geared up and ready to go. I really didn't have time to check it over as everyone was in the middle of the arena. Yes, it's my fault, not hers.      So I was leading him through the arena gates when he decided to have a little bit of a fuss. He's usually always so placid and calm, and at that instant I knew something was off.   Shameful as it may sound, I decided to get on with the lesson instead of dwelling over his behavior.      As I was mounting, he did a pivot away from me and I half tipped forward. I moved him back into place and he did it again. That stinking girl decided to shout at me to hold him still. No, I don't mean shout in an 'I'm a little far away, I'd better raise my voice a-bit' sort of shout.   I mean an "I'm so great and I know everything and you seriously suck" sort of shout as she stormed towards me looking like a mad cow, which really put me off. She tends to have that attitude with everyone and yet she's only been working there for 3 weeks.      Anyway she waddled over (lol) to hold him steady for me, literally grabbing the reins out of my hand. I decided to ask if he played up on anyone before me and she said this was his first ride for the day. I then asked if I could check or re-do his tack incase that was the problem for his behavior and she replied that it was fine (in a "how dare you ask me that question" sort of way) and that I had no time and Amy (instructor) was on her way and to just get on the horse.      To which I replied by pointing out that his blanket was scrunched between the cantle and the panel and it's probably causing him some discomfort.   Know what she did? She literally yanked and tugged the pad forward like an insane woman! Each time she yanked, he would get tenser until he had enough, stamped his hoof and whipped his bum around, knocking me to the ground instead of her! (What a traitor!)      At that point, almost in tears, I’d had enough. I got up, grabbed the mounting block and proceeded to try move the saddle back in place as to smoothen down the hair she'd so evidently shoved the wrong way. However, to my dismay, Amy ended up coming through the arena and got a little ticked off that I wasn't mounted and ready to go like the rest of the group.      I tried to explain his behavior but she dismissed it and I stupidly mounted the poor horse!      The lesson started off fine. He was quite tense and not completely complying to my aids but other than that he was O.k. It was until we got into jumping that he started to act up. As soon as we landed on our first jump, his ears went back, his body tensed up and he pivoted sideways. I just managed to hold on.      I was asked to do it again he refused. He would not go over. I ended up getting an ear bashing by my coach and asked to step behind the group. It was the worst blooming lesson of my life.      I posted this on a different website the other day and half the people were with me, yet the other half thought I was having a whine about stable hands which isn't true. Only this stable hand in particular.      So I'm thinking, is it entirely my fault? I know I must be partly to blame for my lack of initiative. What about the instructor and the stable hand?   I felt as if Amy should have had a look at him and explored all possibilities instead of ignoring my plea. I'm really considering changing stables. I've been riding for 4 years now and attended that stable for almost 2 years. I would have expected at least a little bit of respect.   Am I right to be upset about the behavior of the stable hand? A lot of people thought I was a complete idiot for being angry at them both.      What are your thoughts?   
20081012155951AAyhIE0	Pets;Birds	Dwarf Cockatoo Destroying Toys??	I have a female Dwarf Cockatoo that keeps destroying everything in her cage. I don't know how to stop her. She has a big cage with lots of toys and still has flying space. I take her out for atleast 3 hours a day, when I get home and I rearrange her cage about once or twice a week. I alternate the toys that are in her cage too, I have about 15 toys for her and only 8 - 10 go in her cage. Her cage is in the computer room, and there is also another bird (Indian Ring-Necked Parakeet) and 3 Degus in here. She has only been in this room 2 weeks, and she is already starting to imitate the sound of the other bird. I just want to know why she has been destroying her toys. I used to have about 50 different toys, and now there is only about 15. All of the toys that are still okay are the really tough ones that are hard to break.      WHY IS SHE SO DESTRUCTIVE?

Ils discutent tous les 2, ils font des petits bruits comme s'ils se parlaient et ils jouent surtout à cache-cache et ils se font peur! Le déclencheur a été une boule de papier d'aluminium que j'ai fait à sphinx hier soir et ce matin, kiwi était très intrigué et à commencé à se raprocher! A midi, c'était le summum!

My dog Maya has really straight legs and when she stands her ankles aren't bent like a normal dogs. Any explanations?? Her legs never bother her. I feel them all the time to make sure they aren't getting sore or anything and it never bothers her. The only time her legs ever seem stiff is when she's been laying down in an awekard position for a really long time. We plan on getting xrays done whenwe can afford them but in the mean time I'm just wondering if anyone knows what this could be. I've never seen any dog with such straight legs before. They are only like this when she stands straight. While shes walking and running she bends them normally. She also can still run REALLY fast, so I really don't think they ever bother her...can dogs be double jointed?

One of my students has this really pricey Anglo-Arab, great mover, flashy, pretty obedient and willing to please. But in the past 2 lessons I have noticed her horse tripping with his back right leg.

He's not lame and he shows no signs of swelling or heat in any of his legs. I don't really know what to tell her about why he keeps doing this, there seems to be no reason, he doesn't even seem to be sloppy and misplacing his feet or anything. Any ideas?

He's a generly great horse!       A little history: Retired from the track when he was 4, then he was a barrel racer for a short time. Then I got him and he was great for the first month, introduced him to the english pleasure saddle, and doing great! Previous owner said he always went in a snaffle so I kept him in my loose ring snaffle. I started training him to jump and  to do dressage. He started to get bad and tossing his head. Hes tarted to get upset and do little rears and jumps when I try to make him do accurate 20 meter circles and other general stuff. Sometimes he will try to break into a canter. When ever I mount him he will immediately start tossing his head into his chest and out away from his chest.   We have changed his saddle twice, switched him from a loose ring to a JP oval mouth, chiro was out, nothing wrong with his back, teeth were done last year, feet were recently done about 4 weeks ago. Im out of options! What do you think?? He's not on any hot feeds either, just a timothy alfalfa, brom mix type grass.        PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

20080927105224AAt4tr2	Pets;Horses	We are looking at buying my first horse! Any pointers?	I've been riding for 6 years and leasing several horses for 5.5 years. I've had 9 different trainers(some sucked, some moved too far away, some we really liked) so I've learned lots from each one of them. One of my trainers did what she calls "Western Dressage" and it really was. I had two huntseat trainers, a Parelli instructor (we loved her but she moved to Colorado to the School of Parelli:( ) I also had a wonderful amazing dressage trainer for 2 years. And for the past year or so I've really wanted to pursue eventing. I've been jumping for slightly over a year, went to horse camp for a week and jumped 3'3" on a awesome Saddlebred. I school 2'9". We are looking at several horses, and are leases are not working out so well (one is a pony that I've leased for 5 years and I love to death but is way too small and the other, I've leased for over a year but she's just not working for me) so I'm pretty sure it's the right time. My mom says it's up to me and my grades now, but she really expects a lot more than I can handle. I'm in 7th grade, second year of middle school, and I am having a huge problem with one of my very verbally abusive friends. I'm trying to deal with that, and have the added worry of trying to get perfect grades, and trying to make sure my baby (leased pony of 5 years) will be in good hands cuz I have strong doubts about his owner. I want to do some school related things, like go to the dances and try out for the school play, which my mom assured me I could do, but I don't know. I'm not worried about my homework, but that my moms says that a B- is unacceptable. She basically wants straight A's. So basically what I'm asking is for mom and school help, and pointers on my first horse. Thank you!

20080929092020AAIwMa6	Pets;Horses	Horse tendon injury?  Treatment?	My thoroughbred has soft, "puffy" swelling around his fetlock joint and up the cannon to the knee on his right front leg. There is very little heat and he doesn't mind flexing the leg but he can barely put weight on it. He still has a normal appetite (rare for him) and normal behavior other than limping and lying down more frequently. He is kept alone in hilly pasture with soft, dry footing. He has bad hooves and is not in work at this time, but had no difficulty moving, bucking, running etc before this injury. What could this be? It doesn't seem to be a major tendon injury- no bowing, no drop in the fetlock joint, he wasn't in work etc. Maybe it's a small strain? In which case what can I do to help? I hesitate to call the vet out (he's very far away) if it's something that only requires stall rest and wrapping.

They get really swollen when it gets cold outside and today they hurt so bad it was hell riding. They're worse now than ever. My mom wants me to get surgery but I would like to avoid that. I could barely get my boots on today because they were swollen.      I am wondering if anyone else has knee problems from riding and what do you do about it? Did not want to post this in other section since other people would not know what it feels like while riding. I tried braces but then I can not put my boots on and things like icy hot blister my skin and don't really help? Linimint helps just make it feel better when I'm in home but effect goes away once I start walking or riding.

20081023141057AAx9t1T	Pets;Horses	Anyone know of an online support group for people with injuries caused by horses?	I was riding my horse, Jack, 3 weeks ago and he began to spook a little bit so I began to dismount.  I was riding bareback so I slipped a leg over him and landed on my feet, but the problem was that when I landed, my knee buckled and shattered.  I had to have surgery and am now not able to walk or ride for months.  The pain and bed rest are not what is bothering me though, its the thought that I have to be away from my horses for 3 months at least!  I was wondering if anyone else has been through this and what they did to reverse the depression that I am sinking into.  Horses have been my life for 25 years, and I just feel so incredibly lost right now without my babies, and it's only been 3 weeks since the injury!  I've read horsey books, watched horsey movies, but nothing seems to be filling the hole in my heart being away from my 5 loves. Anyone know of support groups or anything similar?  Anyone have similar stories?

Well, the horse I am adopting is a 4-year-old Quarter Horse filly. She was ridden as a yearling by a man who weighed 250lbs, so she has a swayback now.       Does anyone have any tips for me and my new rescue horse? Like types of training, certain excersises I can do with her to help her swayback, etc. Even helping her build up her trust towards me. When I first met her, our personalities just clicked, and we bonded immedietely. However, that doesn't mean that she trusts me completely. This horse was going to be slaughtered as a yearling.... :(

Also, the smells are so bad I'm thinking of changing his food. Any suggestions on great organic food that won't make my puppy have gas and bad breath? Thanks!

He's an attention wh*re and extremely loving, but he gets in these moods where he chews on everything - boxes, trashcans, blankets, pillows, etc.  Sometimes he's particularly feisty and will nip at anyone close to him - they are soft play nips and he's never attempted to bite a stranger.  He's with me while I work and I don't always have the time to direct him to his toys or give him complete attention when he's bored. Sometimes even long walks won't work.  Any experts out there have some advice?  As a pit mix owner I want to be extra careful he grows up a safe, loving dog.

20090220124453AAckFpq	Pets;Dogs	Dog starting to bite, and growl?	I have a 2 other dogs one is a Chihuahua and the other is a dashound. The dashound has come into heat just a couple days ago. Now my mix breed dog is going crazy. He is starting to destroy my house. Which he has done before but not this bad.  He has started to hike his leg instead of squatting. I figure it is a sign of sexually maturity. But what has got me so worried is he has started to bite my husband and growl at me some. When he bites it is never hard.  Only time he does so is when he is in trouble or we are trying to get off the furniture or away from something. He has all ways been a sweet dog. Never growled, bite or hardly barked which he is also doing now. Especially if we are busy and not petting him when he wants it. I am scared that he will eventually start to bite harder. I and my husband are trying to have a kid and it scares me that he may harm a baby.  He is my baby and I don't want to get rid of him. But if the behavior continues my husband will make me. If it helps any my husband is the main person to discipline him. Thanks so much

20090220165720AAcWE7a	Pets;Birds	Taming an aggressive budgie (not mine)?	My friends have a budgie, they are on holidays so I'm looking after it. I want to tame it, even if its not gonna be like super tame, but just so it wont bite so much.      We let him out every day, not like our friends they never let it out. It bites so much. It flies on your head but if you put your hand there it'll bite it. It keeps biting, if it flies on your arm it just starts biting it and it really hurts.      I don't know how old it is, but it's not young... This is gonna be hard but I want him to stop biting. Please help.

20090203080503AALZVOu	Pets;Fish	What is the best way to redecorate an active fish tank?	I have a ten gallon fish tank with two large goldfish.  Currently is it decorated with normal gravel, some fake plants, and large stones.  I am tired of the large stones, and would like to remove them all in one day, then vacuum the tank, and maybe a little while down the line get something like an old shipwreck model or something like that.  The  question:  Is this going to hurt the fish?  Could I take the plants out, clean them, and put them back into the tank without hurting the fish?  How should I go about doing this?

I recently purchased a Black Bear Hammie and am wondering what experienced hammie owners prefer...wire cage or aquarium for a home. Sophi...right now is in a small aquarium and I plan on buying her a new home this week. I have 2 other dwarf hammies and both are in separated wire cages. Sophi is taken out allot and given allot of exercise and loves to ride in the pocket of my robe....very interesting lil critter.
20090203075759AAKjBsd	Pets;Cats	My cat keeps pooping on the floor. Need help and advice.?	I have a cat that keep pooping on the floor around his litter box instead of in the box itself. He doesn't do this every time he poops, but quite often. We have a simple, non enclosed litter box that I scoop everyday and empty and refill once a week. When he poops on the floor, I clean up the mess and use Brawn Cleaner with Bleach to clean the spot (it's a cement floor). He has been doing this for a couple years now.      One idea I had was maybe I should try switching to the clump litter so when the cat pees in the litter box, the soiled litter doesn't just get chopped up and mixed around. Any other ideas and suggestions?       My cat is male, not sure how old but had him since I was in 3rd grade and I am now finishing my second year of college. Also, I'm not sure if this means anything but my cat's poop has been mushy for awhile but we only feed him dry food and he doesn't get any treats or wet food.

I only got her yesterday and I'm leaving her to settle in, but in the meantime I'm trying to think of a name.   She is a golden colour, with a white belly.      My previous hamsters were called Coco, Fudge and Honey.      I'm thinking maybe Cookie?   Any thoughts or ideas welcome.

20090203080844AATYJQ6	Pets;Dogs	What could be causing her dry skin?	I have a weimaraner. She is almost 2. Ever since she turned about a year old she has had dry flaky skin. We have had her on strongpoint food for the past 4 or 5 months. She was on canidae before that but the new formulas messed up her stomach. Both the canidae and the strongpoint are high in omegas. She also had been on fish oil for a few months while eating the canidae food with no improvement. It doesn't seem to bother her or make her itch. I bathe her maybe once every two months. I use Tropiclean shampoo, it is a natural shampoo.      I realize that it is dry this time of year, but we do run a humidifier and the problem doesn't go away in the summer.      My vet just thinks she has dry skin and hasn't suggested any solutions or testing.      I'm wondering if anyone knows what could be causing her issues besides food and bathing. Can there be some type of chemical imbalanace internally?

20090220165713AAYM0RC	Pets;Fish	Fish Tank trim color change...?	Hey all, I recently upgraded my 55gal. tank to a 75 gal tank but it came with a black stand and a tank with light oak trim. I believe it is hard to find/replace the plastic trim for the tank (and plus I believe it acts as a support for the tank) so not sure if I would like to go that route...but have any of you painted yours? If so what is the process and what kind of paint do you use? How many coats? A clear sealer for water spillage? Any other advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone in advance. Cheers!
