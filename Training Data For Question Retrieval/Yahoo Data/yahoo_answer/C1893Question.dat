What is, in other words, the interest of the companies that make this kind of software if they give it away? I'm sure it's not out of charity. In Europe, Microsoft was convicted for tying the sale of Windows to its mediaplayer and so blocking the market for other mediaplayers. So I know it's pretty high stakes, I just don't understand the rationale...

20080926133105AAY3iPK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Original printer cartridges are better than cheap ones is this true?	I used to have an epson dx4200 printer and everytime I printed using the original cartridges that came with it, the quality would be great. Then I started using cheap cartridges that were ￡2 each and the quality of the printouts went downhill and I started getting thick white lines down my printouts. 5 years later I have recently bought a canon pixma ip4500 printer. I did the same again...used the original canon ink that came with the printer and the printouts were great then I started using cheap ink that is ￡2 each and now when I print i get red and green stripes down my printouts. Is this due to using cheap ink and if I bought the original genuine cartridges would I have the same problem? Ive done a nozzle check pattern and it came out fine and ive even cleaned the heads. Ive had the canon pixma printer for a month.
20081015161640AAOZaFR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	USB Device Not Recognized arrggggh?	I have got a ice digital webcam by Lanjin electronics limited. I installed the driver in the past and it worked perfectly. Instead of using the 'safely remove hardware' feature on the taskbar i would just unplug the usb and i dont think it has done the webcam anygood. Everytime I insert the webcam into usb, it now says: 'USB Device Not Recognized. Ive gone to device manager and removed everything to do with USB (including the USB hubs and controllers). Ive then restarted the pc and it has recognized them and reinstalled them again but im still getting the same problem. It will say that the hardware has been installed and ready for use while in a seperate yellow bubble it still gives me a message saying the USB device is not recognized. How can I sort this problem because I have been without a webcam for months.

Im tempted to see how a chipped cartridge would printout but want to know if the printouts any good 1st.
20080928125457AAB45FP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	How can i sort out this problem with my printer?	I bought a new canon pixma ip4500 about a month or so ago. I installed the original canon cartridges that came free with it and the print out quality was excellent. The cartridges eventually ran out so i got the red (CLI-8M) and black (PGI-5BK) refilled and bought the other 4 colours for ￡2 each out of a computer shop. i had to take the chip off original cartridges and put them onto them. The printer continued to printout in excellent quality but now the ink levels are under half way my printouts are coming out terrible. Either in the absolute wrong colour or with green and red stripes through. Ive used all the built in cleaning things that can be accessed in the printers menu and its still doing it. When i print out a nozzle check pattern the pattern comes out perfect. What should I do?

I want to do this over a network preferable without password access between both PC's       HERE'S MY PROBLEM   on windows XP (which im more familiar with) i could just set up a network and put the network install on a jump drive and configure it with the jump drive files. Vista is new to me and very confusing. Im knowledgeable in computers just not in vista.      please help. (i am able to add details to answer any questions feel free to ask)   Ps:  i do not have wireless on my desktop to run an ad hock or temp wireless connection.

20081018160957AAqMVGh	Computers & Internet;Software	Why does "End Task" in Vista not "End task"?	Ok, I have a new and powerful computer, but often MSN and YIM crash for whatever reason. Fair enough I can live with that. But what I am having difficulty in figuring out, is why when I try and end task, it doesn't end it. When I give up trying to end task, I restart the computer, and then it freezes with hard drive going crazy. I have too physically hard turn off the computer which in long term may damage my computer. Sometimes when Internet Explorer crashes, I am not even able to run task manager due to "unknown Error" (very rare), and same happens when I try to shut down. So what I am asking is why when my PC is incredibly powerful, has no viruses or malware or spy files, with all the up to date versions of both IE7 MSN and YIM, can Vista somehow not be good enough to end task? Many Thanks

Ok,when I did a virus scan Symantec let me know I had a trojan.Brisv.A!in f and it is not in quarantine but it is still an unresolved security risk. I guess I need to download the removal tool and remove it.It says for windows xp and some others to save certain files first but it does not say you have to do that with windows vista, so I guess you don't have to right?Or if you do, how do I know which ones?Also I am not a computer whiz it sounds pretty hard but if I follow the directions should I be able to do it and will it remove it completely?Any info on this will help.Thanks!

It's really just for practise/learning use.      I can send emails from a client's Outlook 2007 inside the domain AND outside the domain successfully.      However, I can't email any of my users from OUTSIDE my domain.        If I send an email from my cox.net address and send it to user1@mydomain.com, user1 doesn't get the email.  And, the cox.net address does NOT get an undeliverable.  (It did get an undeliverable prior to me figuring out that I had to set up the MX record, which now makes sense to me.)  It's almost as if the email is out in limbo somewhere......??      I bought my domain from mydomain.com and I set up my MX record there.  I used servername.mydomain.com for the MX record.  This is correct, right?      Also, on Exchange, I have the smtp connector configured to, "Forward all mail through this connector to the following smart hosts" (smtp.east.cox.net)      And finally, I have the properties of the POP3 connector Manager configured as follows:   Email server: ns1.mydomain.com <---per www.mydomain.com's Web site....I think this is the correct entry that I am to put here, right??   Port: 110   User name: user1   password: ^^^^*****   confirm password" *******   Mailbox type: User Mailbox   Exchange Mailbox: User1      Why won't Exchange recieve emails?!?!

Lets say you created a library that puts the users functions in multiple threads. So the user passes a function pointer to your thread creation function. Is it possible in C to not know what their parameters are, thus making it polymorphic parameters and have them fill the parameters before passing to your function.      Example:   // Takes in function, creates thread, manages context switching    threadcreate(void* (*fptr)(void*), ... )      Use:   int myfunct(int, int, char); // Funct def, body doesn't matter      int (*fptr)(int,int,char);   // Fill somehow the parameters ?   threadcreate(fptr, ...); // Put function on thread

Also, I see that there is an "Intel Proset Wireless" program running.  Could this be colliding with something I'm already using?

But what I want is to access the server itself. I'm actually using jdbc connection but I'm not sure what to write in the url.   I use this url to access the server and it works fine when I access it from the same network that the server resides in:   jdbc:sqlserver://  :1433;DatabaseName=mydatabase      But it gives me an error "TCP/IP connection has failed".

Have to access by wireless using my laptop where the main desktop some 20metres away is surfing using the eternet cable.      My wireless remains weak, 56.0Mbps, signal strength is very low. It frequently disconnects itself and then connect back again.      Router and adaptor is provided by my broadband plan.      Any idea how to help stabilize the wireless network?

I have a telecommuting job for a large s/w company, but want to telecommute from somewhere warmer in the US for a couple of months, and don't want to let my boss know :-)  Can the IT dept easily know my whereabouts if my boss asks them?        I am using a company laptop and use the following s/w to connect:   - Verizon air card (completely 100% my own) - based on Qualcomm 3G CDMA   - VPN client: Cisco v 4.8.x or higher   - VOIP soft phone: Cisco Communicator 2.x (I use this for internal conf. calls)   -  MyDesktop: is a company proprietaty software, which allows system admins to automatically upgrade your laptop with upgrades; and a central location for IT messages/warnings.  Also supplies licensed sw delivery      My initial guess is that the company's VPN server will be able to see the VPN connection request coming from an IP address that is owned by Verizon.  However, what I am worried about, is that the cell tower / satelite uplink company name will be added to the foot print, such as "Florida Telco", "Hawaii Telco", etc...      Thanks in advance !!
20090225104311AAY4Ce3	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why is my computer playing internet videos so choppy and google error keeps coming up?	I've noticed recently that my internet has been acting strange, I haven't done anything different, and I haven't downloaded anything so I can't figure out why it's doing this, but when i try to play a youtube video or some other web site's video it loads just fine and quickly but when it plays the video it is choppy. The audio is just fine and plays without skipping. Also, I've noticed that around the same time as this problem sometimes when I click a link on my toolbar it would send me to google saying there was an error and the page could not be found when i know for a fact that the page is there. Sometimes I can keep clicking the link and it'll then go to the site, but sometimes I have to close firefox and start it again. I have an acer aspire 5610Z running windows vista home premium on a school network and also on my home wireless network whenever I go home. Both networks have the same problem, so I don't believe it is a network connection issue.
