JERUSALEM (AFP) - Hawkish Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday named Iran as Israel's main threat after accepting the task of forming a new government in the wake of the tight February 20 elections.   "Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon and constitutes the gravest threat to our existence since the war of independence," he said at a ceremony at President Shimon Peres's official residence.    http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/090220/wo...       ------------------       Netanyahu claimed that it is 1938 and Iran is Germany citing misquoted speeches and ignoring the fact he himself has a nuclear arsenal of his own told the world they have to strike Iran as quickly as possible for their own survival        Russia sees Iran and Poland and watches Hitler tell the German people that the Polish are a threat and will attack Germany if action isn't taken immediately ignoring the fact that the Polish have a calvary from the 1st war no tanks and no air force --       Russia has told the Israeli government and the world -- An attack on Iran = an attack on Russia        China -- buys oil from Iran and hasn't been pleased with the US and it's economic tragedy stories India and Pakistan are at each others throats right now but untied on their need for oil from Iran        Why shouldn't I believe Russia who has blamed Israel and the US for the Georgian attacks on them ? Why shouldn't I believe Russia who asked Bush how he would like war ships in the Caribbean as a come back to US war ships in the Black sea --- and then put war ships in the Caribbean ? Why shouldn't I believe Russia when he said he would match NATO plane for plane and ship for ship and then did so        Russia --- will end Israel forever should they attack Iran --       Why shouldn't I believe them ? Why is  Netanyahu so foolish as to dismiss this warning ?

I received a 40+ page fax today that was meant to go to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. I tried to stop the fax but it just got sent again. It has the social security and medical history of over 30 people detailed in it, it even says what schools they have gone to and allot of other private information that I shouldn't have. I called up Mount Sinai and told them and the secretary gave me a huge attitude problem because I did not call to speak to doctor or have an appointment.

My ex boyfriend picked me up in a stolen vehicle, which his friend has lent to him. He didn't know it was stolen and neither did I. We were arrested while we were parked in a parking lot. He was charged and they threatened to charge me unless I told them the truth due to the fact that my ex had told them that he was't driving and his mates were down the road and coming back, due  to the face that he has no licence and was trying to cover his ***, not knowing the car was stolen. This looks bad for him. I made a witness statement verifying that he was in fact driving and had told me to confirm the story that his friends were around somwhere, which is of course a ridiculous idea.    Now I am worried and want to withdraw my statement in case he does something to me or his friends do. If I withdraw my statement will they then want to charge me for the initial crime of being in a stolen vehicle? Is that even a crime if I was unaware and they obviously knew that?      How can I go about withdrawing my statement?   Please helppp.      I'm in Australia by the way.

Regardless of if you are Liberal or Conservative, Democrat or Republican, would you support this plan and vote for it.      Mandate that the Government cannot spend more than 90% of revenue and that the other 10% go towards paying off the National Debt.  If the Government spends more than the designated amounts every Congressman, Senator and the President all get a 25% PAY CUT that year.  In addition, no elected official can get automatic pay raises, there must be a televised prime time vote with plenty of advanced notice so that the people and media are aware that Congress is voting themselves a pay raise.      This isn't about party affiliation, it's about leaving a future for our kids and grand kids.  Do you agree and tell me if you are a Conservative, Liberal...etc.  I am really curious if this idea appeals to a wide cross section of people.

Holder was also involved in Clinton's decision to reduce the sentences of 16 members of the Boricua Popular Army, an organization that has been categorized by the FBI as a terrorist organization. The clemency request was initially opposed in 1996 by U.S. Pardons Attorney Margaret Love. When Holder was elevated to Deputy Attorney General in 1997, he was asked to reexamine the issue by three members of Congress. In July 1999, Holder recommended clemency to President Clinton with a report from then U.S. Pardons Attorney Roger Adams that neither supported nor opposed clemency. A month later, the clemency was granted by Clinton. According to The Hartford Courant, the clemency was unusual because it was opposed by the FBI, the federal prosecutor and the victims. According to the newspaper, it was also unusual because, before the commutations, the Boricua Popular Army members were not required to repudiate their actions, and they were not asked to provide any information concerning the whereabouts of Victor Manuel Gerena, a co-conspirator and one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, or the millions of dollars stolen by the group in a 1983 robbery of Wells Fargo in West Hartford, Connecticut.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder       Am I the only one that sees what's going on in our nation?

My cousin tried to enter the US illegally by land. She got caught a couple of times by border patrol and each time they caught her they took her fingerprints.

20090220081014AA5myeo	Politics & Government;Politics	Quick question for everyone...esp. those people who are making a living and never went to college :)?	So I'm having a dilemma. I realllly want to be a Nurse, but it's honestly taking a HELL of a long time to get into a program. I swear, if I'm lucky I'll get in within 4 years. I live in NYC, but I'm from San Diego..it's insanely competitive everywhere.   Well, I'm thinking..what do I do if I don't go to college for Nursing? Not much else interest me that I am willing to sacrifice 4 years of my life. I mean, yeah, I LOVE dance, psychology, health administration...but in the same time..I can probably just save my parents they 20k a year (80k TOTAL) and work at an office somewhere...save up a LOT of money in a few more years..and start my own small business..nothing ridiculous..but where I am my own boss...and maybe bring in 60k after taxes..and that's not a lot in NYC..but pretty decent .   So I'm wondering...why don't more people do this? I see so many people wasting their parents money on college to get degrees that honestly, I hate to say, got them a supervisor position at Starbucks. Is it fair? No...The only people I know with reallly stable jobs are ones who majored in engineering, finance, law, medical, science, and maybe computers. The rest are just floating by.      So are there any of you out there that make MUCH more than college graduates that you know? If so, what do you do and do you like it?    Don't get me wrong..I believe that education is invaluable..but I also realize that if I go to get my degree in Criminal Justice (which I find SUPER interesting as well) that my options aren't going to be that broad..and what difference would it really make? For that, I can skip college and go right into the police force or something....      Please don't take my examples literally. I know those of you who are intelligent will understand this question and give me great answers :).

How does she stop when she's not doing anything in the first place?  My question, Doesn't an accuser have any burden to prove a charge? Can a person be cited for a false harassment charge?

20090203130846AAOLGwc	Politics & Government;Elections	Are you a Obama Supporter? ?	Are you a Obama Supporter? If so, how????????      the Senate began debate on an economic stimulus package that is intended to get our economy back on track and help Americans who are suffering through these difficult times. Unfortunately, the proposal on the table is big on the giveaways for the special interests and corporate high rollers, yet short on help for ordinary working Americans.      I DO NOT support the package on the table from the Democrats and the Obama Administration. Our country does not need just another spending bill, particularly not one that will load future generations with the burden of massive debt. We need a short term stimulus bill that will directly help people, create jobs, and provide a jolt to our economy.       I believe we need to evaluate every bit of spending in this stimulus proposal with one important criteria - does it really stimulate the economy and help create jobs - if the answer is no, it does not belong in a so-called stimulus package.       Furthermore, the stimulus must include significant direct relief to American workers in the form of payroll tax cuts and programs to help homeowners keep their homes.       Finally, we need an end game to this stimulus so that when our economy recovers, these spending programs do not remain permanent and saddle our children with a skyrocketing national debt      I appreciate the discussions President Obama is having with  Republican, but the time for talking has come to an end and we must now begin some serious negotiation.       But as of yet, Republicans have not been given the opportunity to be involved. The House of Representatives passed a stimulus bill without a single Republican supporting it. In the Senate, the Democrat leadership is trying to jam the existing proposal through regardless of reservations from a number of members. With so much at stake, the last thing we need is partisanship driving our attempts to turn the economy around.       we face extraordinary challenges with our economy today, but that is not an excuse for more irresponsibly from Washington and Obama admin!!!       I hope you will join me in saying no to this stimulus package as it currently exists by signing this petition.        http://www.countryfirstpac.com/petition/...

20090220084854AAApplQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Child support question?	ok so here is the story my brother in law has a four year old daughter that he has never seen and today i went his court hearing because he doesn't speak english and he needed help he is unemployed and behind on his child support. he wanted me to ask them if he could get a DNA test and if it is his daughter than he also wants visitation. They told us we would have to find a place to do the test and even if it isn't his kid he still has to pay the back support and they also told us that we would have to go and file papers for him to get visitations. so my question is if the child isn't his how can they make him support it and why cant he see the kid he has done nothing wrong legally except not paying of course. also he will be working again in april and we told the judge that he could start paying again then.

20090220090825AAgbZxc	Politics & Government;Politics	At what point if ever will anti war liberals demand action from President Obama?	While Washington and much of the media routinely crow about a supposed “return to normalcy” in Iraq, the conditions facing the country’s 28 million people remain appalling.   The human toll from nearly six years of US occupation is estimated, according to the most credible surveys, at over one million dead. According to the International Office on Migration, 2.8 million Iraqis are internally displaced persons, forced from their homes by the violence, and another 2.4 million are refugees who fled the country.   Having decimated Iraq’s infrastructure with the “shock and awe” bombardment of March 2003 and more than a decade of punishing economic sanctions that preceded it, Washington has done next to nothing to rebuild the country outside of efforts to reconstitute its security forces as a puppet army of repression. Instead, the so-called reconstruction effort has consisted of a massive looting operation by corporations awarded cost-plus contracts for work that in many cases was never done and in others done so badly as to be worthless.   The result of this corruption and negligence is a continuing social catastrophe for the Iraqi people. According to a recent Oxfam report, the share of Iraqis without access to adequate water supplies rose from 50 percent to 70 percent from the start of the war to 2007.   According to the inspector general’s report, two-thirds of Baghdad’s sewage flows untreated into the city’s rivers and waterways, finding its way into the drinking water. The result is repeated deadly outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.   At least two-thirds of Iraqis are still plagued by inadequate power supplies as a result of the war’s destruction, with frequent and prolonged blackouts making normal economic and domestic life impossible.   The population remains mired in mass unemployment. According to official figures, 18 percent of Iraqis are jobless, with another 10 percent unable to find full-time employment.   The criminal US war in Iraq has not ended with the inauguration of President Barack Obama, and there are growing indications that it will continue even as his administration escalates the war in Afghanistan.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...

20090220092837AA0YEgY	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are people only holding Republicans responsible for the mess?	In 1995, President Bill Clinton asked for a revision of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 that was more streamlined and would allow poorer Americans to own their own homes. The result was the Community Reinvestment Act of 1995, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic President. This created the so-called Subprime Mortgage Market. During Congressional hearings in 1995, one William A. Neskanen claimed this revision of the CRA would, in the long term, contract the banking system.      In 2007, the Subprime Mortgage Market crashed and the banking system contracted drastically - leading us (partially) into this recession.      RESPONSIBLE PARTIES: Republicans (Passing the Bill) and Democrats (Signing the Bill)      The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was accomplished by passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This act allowed banks to acquire other financial assets such as mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. The passage and signing of this bill essentially encouraged banks to practice predatory lending. When this Act was combined with the CRA95, it became the main force behind the 2007 financial collapse.      Responsible Parties: Republicans (Passing the Bill) and Democrats (Signing the Bill)      So...when are you Democrats going to man up and shoulder your fair share of the blame? You can't keep blaming Bush forever.

20090220082642AAGFwd2	Politics & Government;Politics	Where are Democrat Principles?	"We believe in balanced budgets and paying down our national debt, while Republicans continue to put huge burdens on future generations by borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from foreign nations. We want to restore the budget discipline of the 1990s that helped eliminate deficits and spur record economic growth."       Source: 2006 Democratic Party Congressional Promise Nov 1, 2006    http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Democra...           Why did the Democrats push their spendulus bill through Congress if they clearly stated above they want to pay off the national debt. So Democrats plan to pay off our national debt by increasing it by trillons of dollars as proposed over 10 years in their stimulus bill. With the quote above being proof the Democratic party is either hypocrites or corrupt politicians who will say whatever it takes to get elected. What has happened with Democratic morals? I'm not saying they had any to begin with, but for you democrats who believe you have any left, you can go ahead and answer the question.
20090220093408AAFqW1h	Politics & Government;Government	Are the American people already going sour on Obama?	-First and foremost if you need to replay with "Bush did this" or "at least" just go on and finish growing up. This country deserves better than at leasts-      What has me upset is two things 1) I don't care what anyone says, gasoline instability is what sparked this recession. there are a hundred underlying issues but Gasoline going to 4 bucks and people scared it will happen again, triggered this. It's not rocket science that a man making $10 and hour who suddenly started spending $50 a week on gas isn't buing anything. I haven't heard Obama even utter a word about it, muchless address it. He is an oil company whore the same as all the others.   2) If I understand correctly the 200bil of this stimulus going for mortgage relief is just more money given to the banks in HOPES they will pass it on to the people. No Guarantees. ie here's another $200 billion from the people for the wealthy.      Those are my major problems but what do you people think? The media says his ratings are high but EVERY board I am reading, even the ultra liberal ones, people are lighting his *** up!! I am really shocked not for good or bad but I have not read a positive word on the man. I don't believe he deserves anything positive but I am amazed at how quick the new has worn off, I'm kind of proud of the people. His major points since election have been abortion, gay rights and giving a billion dollars away.

20090220084801AAsoRD9	Politics & Government;Politics	Did this student deserve to be violently attacked for wanting to ask Ann Coulter a question at a book signing?	"Ann Coulter spoke at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, NJ on Wednesday, 2/18. I am a student at the university and was in attendance. During the Q&A portion of the event, I asked a question that referred to a remark Coulter had made earlier in the evening. She said something along the lines of Republicans being justified in their attempts during the 2008 campaign to brand the Democratic party as soft on terror because its presidential nominee's middle name was Hussein."      So I asked Coulter if she meant to suggest that everyone with a Muslim sounding name should thereby be considered sympathetic to terrorists. She responded, "You can't possibly be that stupid," and went on to say something about Dan Quayle. In short, she did not address my question."  (So the student got on the book signing line to ask the followup question.  They asked him to leave because he didn't have a book)      "I believe there is a video, which hopefully will be uploaded to YouTube soon," he says.      "I did not resist, nor did I shove or strike the officer in any way. I simply started walking in a different direction. I was then tackled to the ground by the officer and surrounded by several others. It was impossible for me to tell how many of them were involved, because my face had just hit the ground head first. One officer restrained me to the floor by my legs, while another knelt on my head, with his knee crushing my face."        http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v452/b...       "He applied a considerable amount of body weight, and my head was pressed against the carpet. I have a relatively large abrasion on the left side of my head and on my left ear. Here is a photo. At this point, I was handcuffed.      I was then literally thrown out of the building via an emergency exit located right across the aisle. I again hit the ground, this time the grass. My glasses flew off my face. I'm very nearsighted, so I could not see much of what went on throughout the rest of this ordeal. Several times I asked for my glasses back and the officers either brushed me off, made some kind of joke, or flat-out refused. When asked why, their explanations were, "Because I said so." and "Because that's the way it is." '      Is there better way for this to be handled?

Regardless of if you are Liberal or Conservative, Democrat or Republican, would you support this plan and vote for it?         1. Mandate that the Government cannot spend more than 90% of revenue and that the other 10% go towards paying off the PRINCIPLE, NOT THE INTEREST of our National Debt all interest payments must be made out if the 90%.       2.  If the Government spends more than the designated amounts every Congressman, Senator and the President and Vice President all get a 25% PAY CUT that year.       3.  In addition, no elected official can get automatic pay raises, there must be a televised prime time vote with plenty of advanced notice so that the people and media are aware that Congress is voting themselves a pay raise.      IMPORTANT!!!  PLEASE READ!!!        Our Government still could run a deficit but all the elected folks from the President down get a 25% pay cut if they do.  This is not about higher or lower taxes, it's about doing what we all have to do which is budget and pay our bills.  If you make $40,000.00 per year you cannot qualify to buy a $25 Million Dollar house...the Government is buying steak on a Cup O' Noodles budget.  Again, I make no statements about where we spend the money or what is spent where...only that we spend less and pay off our debt.         This isn't about party affiliation, it's about leaving a future for our kids and grand kids. Do you agree and tell me if you are a Conservative, Liberal...etc. I am really curious if this idea appeals to a wide cross section of people.

I was driving through town at 43 mph and got a city issued ticket.  The speed limit is posted at 45.  My automatic red Toyota Camry 4 cylinder shifts into 4th gear at 45 mph, and it was not shifted yet, so I know I was under the limit and operating lawfully.  Plus I have my daughter as a witness, I am the one who leaves early and gets flipped off on the freeway for driving 5 mph under speed - just so I cannot be ticketed.  What should I do about this?  I do not want to admit to guilt by just paying it, I have a perfect driving record, and safe driver points on my insurance which saves me money.  I know I am innocent because I had come to a near complete stop in front of the only CLOSED quick station in town.  I needed to use the rest room, but it wasn't urgent.  I told the officer I was looking for a restroom and did not admit anything.  I did apologize, but that was basically because we did not agree, not because I was admitting guilt.  I was courteous, and did not argue with him when he asked me why he pulled me over!   They hold traffic court every 4th Sat.  I have a month plus a week to wait, and I would rather go on the 4th Sat. of this month.   Is that an option, to just show up a month early?  OR is that a HUGE no-no?  Must it always be scheduled?  It is a micro-tiny town, so if I call, they will know my plans.      Thanks in advance.

I exceeded all expectations, brought sales where they needed to be and cut my food costs and cut my labor where it needed to be. They fired me after i got the store fully staffed and running. I was only there for 3 and a half weeks before they fired me without warning. I did not breach my crontract in any way. I was told i was terminated because they didnt want to keep paying me overtime and the person who hired me (who was never in my store) had "personal issues" with me. Is what they did really legal? They kept 2 old managers for over a year when they had stolen large amounts of money and were put back on probation.Why were they never terminated?

My husband recently opened his own business and had to get insurance for his company.  They had a great health coverage package to go along with it so he decided he would go in that direction.   I am currently trying to drop him from my benefits plan, but I am being told that one of two options may occur. #1) He will have to wait until the end of the year to come off my plan.    #2) I will incur a $50 surcharge each paycheck.  I do not understand this.       Can someone please explain?      Thanks!

20090220093126AAwwcI2	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can she file a police report & try to have her own son arrested for this?	Okay. My stepson, lives with his Dad & I, visits his mother.  [and the safest way to explain it--there are a multitude of reasons he has lived with us for 11 years].  Anyway, he was grounded from his cellphone due to bad grades and not watching his texting.  But before & during Xmas holidays his mother let him use a tracphone type of phone while at her house.  Even told him he could take it to our house & she promised she wouldn't tell his Dad.  Over the holidays he even told us about it since he was getting close to being "ungrounded" here anyway, we decided not to pick this battle and let him use the phone at his mom's. (he's 16).   Mid January while visiting her he asks for more minutes.  He claims she added more minutes later that day.  She now claims that she had said no and that he got in her purse, got her debit card, got on her laptop & increased the minutes.  When she saw the charge on her account a few days later she even called trying to get it reversed, even telling the bank & phone compnay that she did not have the phone.  Technically true, she did not have the phone, but the phone was in her apartment with her son as he was in the apartment with her.  He confronted her reminding her about the adding minutes (we dont' know if he did it or she did it--that part is a toss up), she grew angry and he gave her back the phone WITH the minutes on it still.       Now, two weeks later she is demanding that he pay her the $64.87 and has threatened him by saying she is going to call the police and have him arrested. (YES, she even admits she still has the phone, both to us and to him.-- and yes we have proof that she said she has the phone & has had the phone.)      So, does she have a case?  Will she be able to press charges?  Would the police take the report or just laugh at her?        She's even told him he should give back the shoes she bought him and a couple of other things (none very pricey) she's bought him since the holidays.        By the way, as a note of character-- she does owe over $13K in back CS still & a $10K judgement from an earlier court action with us-- like I said, there are a multitude of reasons he lives with us.       So,,,,, does she have a case now against her son?      Thank you....

20090220093841AAedK0O	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If my father had a loan that was not tied to anything and only in his name, do the children have to pay it?	Our mother passed in 2003 and my dad ended up with some of her credit card debt because his name was tied to it, which he paid.  She had other credit card debt in her name only, and the company wrote it off.  Now our father passed end of 2008.  The estate has been in one of our brother's name for about 20 years.  My dad had a loan out in only his name, it is an unsecured loan.  Now that both parents are deceased, are the children responsible for this loan?  We don't think we are in any way shape or form responsible to pay this off.  Us children are getting harassed by the bank to settle up the loan.  The banker talked to one sibling within a week after our father passing regarding paying off the loan that our dad had.  Then one sibling received a letter within a month of our father passing.  Now a second sibling received a same letter within two months of our father passing.  Two of us siblings have talked to the banker already and told him we were not responsible and to just write it off.  To begin with, the banker set up that loan as a interest only loan and my dad was getting nowhere in paying it off.  According to the figures I received today from the bank, my dad would have only had a little over $100 left to pay on it if it were not set up as an interest only loan.  We even asked the banker why he set the loan up like that ... he really did not have a good answer.  Now he just keeps on harassing us.  What do we do?

20090220102357AAWO56T	Politics & Government;Politics	Should the governor of South Carolina refuse ALL federal money?	According to the tax foundation, a non-partisan information group, south Carolina takes in 1.35 from the federal coffers for every dollar they put in.  So they are supported by states like New York, which only takes .79 for every dollar they put in, or New Jersey (the lowest in the nation) which takes .61.       So since the governor of South Carolina is grandstanding about not taking stimulus money for his state. (which he will of course take, he is just posturing) how about we cut off ALL federal tax expenditures in the state?  They would be bankrupt in the matter of weeks.       BTW Comparison for the other governors who are complaining:      Alaska: 1.84 for every $1.    Louisiana:  1.78  for every $1.    Mississippi: 2.02! for every $1.   Idaho: 1.21 for every $1.    Texas: .94 for every $1. (the only governor not being hypocritical of the bunch)       So why are these governors complaining when they have been sucking at the federal teat for so long?

And await many months or years to get this document. Undocumented workers, pay taxes and Social Security fees too. They aren't stealing ID's, they are victims of your laws.

Letting illegal Immigration stay in our country. We have no jobs now in the USA it needs to stop and as well the illegal need deporting. It is time for the americans to take a stand.

So she got one of her friends to come to me and say that he was HER fiance and he had a girlfriend as well. Fortuantley she found out and she is no longer interested in him. Also another girl who clamied to be his girlfriend no longer is interested in him either. I have talked to him about it. He assured me that he was not cheating and he loves me and wants to be with me and blah blah. He talks always of us being together and starting a family. So on and SO on. I want to trust him again because we have been together so long and I really do love him and he is like my best friend. We have done simply everything in life together. He still calls me on a daily basis while he is in Korea. Nothing has changed with him...as far as how he is acting towards me. I want to trust him but I dont know how. Its like I dont understand why he cheated and the other girls are HIGHLY ugly. So I know he didnt cheat because of looks. HELP?? Did any of you stay with your lover and actually work things out?

He did the sobriety check on me and I was sober, like always.

I go on monday, so is it just a hearing, or will the cop who gave me the ticket show up and we go from there?

So I signed myself off on thrusday, worked Sat and Sun and the doc signed me off today.

20070423053421AA9KNI1	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Polygraph test:  can you be unsure?	Let's say the question is something like:      Have you killed a man in the last year?   -and you're not sure if it's been over a year or less than a year since the last time you killed a man.       I thought the answers had to be Yes or No      what if you're not sure?   can you take a guess and the results will tell the examiner that you're not sure?   or how does that work?      please note that i have never killed anyone   that was just an example      do they give you the option to say "I'm not sure" and then have you explain later?      I know pretty much how the polygraph works....i just don't know what happens when you don't know the answer to a question.       Thanks to anybody who can help.
20070331105113AA4f4yt	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Have you ever been caught speeding?  What happened?	I was caught the other day for the first time, but I got a very understanding police officer.        It was midnight, the speed limit was 50, but there was no one on the road, so I was doing 100.  I may be a fast driver but I am a safe driver, I don't speed if there are others around, even on the highway I drive in a manner where I don't have to touch the brakes (I hate people who hit the brakes for everything on the highway).        Anyways, I see the cruiser about 20 meters away, hit the brakes, after passing him, I coast to 60 tryiing to not make it too obvious that I was speeding....he follows me for a bit and pulls me over.  I was heading to work at midnight.  It was then I realize I didn't have my license on me, it was a nice night so I didn't take my jacket with me...dohhhh.  The officer comes over, tells me how fast I was going, and asked why I didn't have my license.  After some talk, and seeing that I have a clean record; he just gave me a warning....I got a great officer that day!

No passado, pregava-se que quem doasse boa parte de sua fortuna ou toda ela, teria vaga garantida no Reino dos Céus. Vendiam-se a peso de ouro as chamadas indulgências.      Junto de muitos esqueletos ou parte deles foram encontradas "cartas de recomenda??o" para que o defunto adentrasse o Paraíso e assim, por diante.      Os políticos, em troca de votos, prometem mundos e fundos. Prometem até aquilo que está acima da competência administrativa deles.

I want to start off a cop, but my question is this, if I want to get into the FBI/CIA should I major in a language such as chinese or arabic? I think this would be a good idea since most police departments will hire you with any 60 credits (you dont even need a degree, just 60 credits). So i want to start off as a cop than get into Fbi/cia.   Most people are telling me major in accounting or computers, but i think arabic or chinese wiould be a smart choice. help me!
