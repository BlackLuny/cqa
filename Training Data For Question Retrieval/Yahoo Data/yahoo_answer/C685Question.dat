20090227102744AASN2WE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Candles during the day?	Trying to plan a low cost wedding in September. Flowers are so expensive, and the church looks beautiful with candles in all the windows. However, it will still be light out for the wedding. How ineffective would candles be as flower subs? If we didn't turn any other lights on, it might be dim enough that the candles are ok... Any thoughts?

20090227103522AAuei7t	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A foreign student looking for home stay host family(or person) in Ontario state, Canada.?	Hi!   I am a 24 years old female graduate school student who lives in Seoul, South Korea. I am very polite, reasonable, and bright person, and no smoke, no disease, no drugs. I am looking for home stay host family or old lady in Ontario state, Canada.      I'll leave for Canada at the end of the March, 2009 (at latest before middle of the April) for under 6 months. The first and most important purpose that I go to Canada is to improve my English ability. But I don't want to spend all days in English academy, cause I think that's nothing but wasting time. If anyone who can think reasonably, she will know there are much less opportunities to learn English in academy.       I am sure that the best way to learn foreign language in abroad is meeting a friendly warm hearted home-stay host family. So I decided to find really nice family who lives in Ontario states. To tell the truth, I really wanna live in the area where is just few Korean lives to use only English when I talk. But as well, you know, what I am studying in school is kind of organize(curating) art exhibitions, I can't possiblly live far apart from galleries, neither museums. So, I just wanna live in nearby these cultural things.       In a words, I want a host family which is satisfy some conditions.   First of all, I prefer to live with family which having little child or old lady, cause I could learn more, through lots of communication with them.   Secondly, please be nice with me, even though I can't speak English well, and also I don't know your culture. I could learn if you and your family let me know about your systems.   Thirdly, I will stay at your place up to 5 months if both of you(and your family) and I like each other. In case that I believe we can't make it, I'll notice you 2 weeks before I leave.   And last of all, I want you to suggest me with resonable price. Please let me know are there any deposit, and how much I have to pay for live with in your house including one or two meals every day.      I wish I could make a good karma, friendship with your family.   Please give me a e-mail with your suggestion.   If there's anything that you want me to answer, please do not hesitate, just ask me.       Thank you.

I'll have the lights really dim.   Or should I just answer door with only a bathrobe on.   when he picks me up and drives me to the beach at 12:00am should I just take off all my clothes right there on the beach.
20090309184751AAmhOKm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy is bugging me and it's not his fault but I'm just not interested! How do I tell him?	One of my contacts on Facebook who used to go to my school started chatting to me. He suggested we met up for a drink and I half agreed and gave him my number...That was about 2 months ago and I've been blowing him out ever since! I'm just thinking that now he may want something more than friendship and I'm just really not attracted to him! (not that he's ugly, just not my type!)      Also, I met my last boyfriend on Facebook and really liked him. He dumped me in December and I'm still not over him, so I'm not looking for a relationship.      It has been about a week and a half since he contacted me. Then last night I had a dream about him. I dreamt that he came to my house and tried to kiss me. It was a terrible kiss so I pulled away. He became offended and ran off. I felt really guilty...Then I woke up and saw a text message on my phone saying "hey are you free anytime this week?" -- a bit spooky lol      What do I do? He hasn't actually said he wants a relationship (although he did suggest we go see a film) so I've got no reason to say no! And I can't tell him I don't want a relationship because he hasn't said he wants one. But I hardly know him! And I don't want him to get the wrong idea. I know how it feels to be ignored and rejected so I can't do that to him...He asked me before if I was purposly ignoring him. I had to say no, but now he thinks he still has hope! Help!      I need to reply soon but what do I say?
20090309184808AALxjMo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm "dating out of my league"?	Well, sort of. I'm 15 and I met this guy who is 16. His name is Jesse, and he is REALLY goodlooking. There's lots of girls that like him. He's really funny and sweet. He respects girls and doesn't pressure me for anything. Such a gentlemen... It's like he's perfect!! I feel like he could do way better. I don't think I'm very pretty. It's just so unbelievable to me that a cute guy could be so modest and... not shallow. I don't know what to think though. I still feel like when people see us together they think "what is HE doing with HER?" =\ Anyone experienced this? I get upset over it sometimes.
20090309184318AAXpUjJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Congratulate Me (this is a statement)?	So today i finally got up the nerve to break up with my girlfriend! i have been wanting to for like 2 weeks now but i cant ever find the right time. so she took it pretty well and i think we might be friends now. we had been dating for 5 months and so now i am single. she was nice but i always felt like she was watching my every move so now im less stressed! so guys and girls congratulate me and girls put up pics of yourselves ;P no im just kidding u don't have to that was just a little humor don't take offense to it.   lol!
20090309182818AAgNWjU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls....I really need your help..........?	This girl rejects me 3 times      But I SWEAR on my life (I would bet my life) that she likes me why?      1. stairs and looks over at me EVERYDAY, twice she stared straight into my eyes and held them there until I looked away (so about 3-4 sec).      2. when I'm around she strokes her hair, (something I never saw her do until recently my junior year) when he does this she either has her head down or turned away from me. And she only does this when I'm around.      3.Have you ever been in a auditorium or a very crowded place, like a stadium and out of everyone there you tend to always find the location of someone you really like? I do this but the thing is she dose it to I know because all the times I've ever been in the school auditorium she has found my location, I know because she looks at me then turns her head when I look in her direction.          4.She treats me different (now this is a key to something that I'll get to later). Now she is a VERY social person but when I'm around she talks to everyone (he friends) but me. And when I do talk to her sometimes well, the way she answers me is different, its pretty quick, and its harder to keep the conversation going, basically  quickly ends it and try to talk to someone else. And the big thing is four boys that like her (she told me, they did because they made a move, b4 me) and another I think likes her sits at our lunch table, and she talks to them way more easier and much more frequently then me, which I know is a good thing, because we are friends and I never made her mad or anything its just like that, I consider this although it may seem a little worst, the "special" treatment, but don't get me wrong there are some times she talks to me and she is smiling and things like that. (in fact friday). I think this is one of the keys to why she is acting like this...............       Now it seems she only talks to me when its excusable, mainly school work (like did you know when was the homework or how you did on your essay, but nothing else) or something big that happens in the school. And she doesn't sit next to me, but almost every time I'm in the library or auditorium she sits next to me, and if she can't she gets as close as possible (If she can get to me, but sometimes classes are given assigned seats so sometime she can't get to me, but she still tends to find out where I'm at)  like one time, in the library she sat next to me then ask me to help her with the computer with something that was ridiculously easy, (she wanted to know how to get up Microsoft word, she used it plenty of time in the library I saw her) and when she got it up she did nothing she just clicked some things then she logged off.       Girls have you ever act like this?       I think I know what it is but I not sure and I want to see if someone else is thinking the same thing I'm thinking.   After some people answer If you end up thinking the same thing I'm thinking then I let you know
20090309184854AAoyO4Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love my boyfriend but..?	Hello I was just curious what you think about this.  I am still in love with my boyfriend we've been together for about a year +, but he likes to watch news mag channels (CNN, FOXNews) basically 24/7 and it's not my favourite interest, at all.  I get annoyed by it because of how much he watches it and doesn't even comment on any of the stories.  When he rarely does, he starts off about something rediculous like "**** if I were going to hi-jack a bunch of ships I'd take their tea and crumpets too"  I'm like....oooooookay....  I know he likes to go out, but then he complains that we can't afford to do the things he wants to do.  Anyways, this news watching thing is really getting on my nerves.  He sits there silent in front of the TV for hours, but then gets all odd and says he will "just go upstairs and watch TV" if I am going to change the channel on him.      SO what do I do?  I don't even like watching TV, he just does it incessantly.  Nothing comes between him and his precious insiders.
20090309184610AAL7yU8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Girlfriend broke up with me but...?	My girl broke up with me and doesnt want to work it out, yet she tells me she misses me and still reads the love letters that I have written her and still looks at any memories of us, pictures, etc. What does that mean? She doesnt want to work it out or want me but why keep the memories??

20090309184501AAOXQ8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you ever wish it was like back when...?	Ok, I know most Y/A users are alot younger than me and most are probably in their early teens, But this question is for someone who is at least 40.   Do you all ever remember the way the world was when you were growing up?  Do you ever miss these things?      Neighbors actually helped neighbors.  They expected nothing in return.      If you grew up in the country, you knew your neighbors and called them by their first name.   Your children said, "no, sir, yes mam", etc. and our Moms didnt call the cops if we were 15 min late for supper.  She simply walked to the porch and hollered our names, and we KNEW to get our butts home immediately.     Country follks didnt need to lock their doors at night.  The only reason there was a loaded shot gun in the house, was in case a wild animal attacked a child or person.       Your mom got you off to school everyday, and she made sure us girls were dressed appropriately.       OK, this is my favorite!    Anyone, do you remember when a man's word and handshake was all you needed to close a deal?        My favorite quote today, is, "If I look you in the eye, shake your hand,,you can bet you are gonna hear the truth"!
20090309183458AAM2RiO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she totally breaking "girl code"?	Ohkay, this is prolly gonna sound all drama-ish.    But here goes;   Ohkay, so this guy, me and him got really close and were planning on going out in the summer possibly. And i thought that, that meant that we would both stay single. Then about a week ago i found out he asked a girl out, and it really crushed me. And so my best friend, she has been talking to that guy, like alot. Before and after he asked out that other girl. And it was sorta bugging me cause like she talks to him ALL the time, and he has told me that he is cute and stuff. So she basically was liking him behind my back and flirting and talking non-stop. And so i was gonna go to a concert with my best friend on friday , but i wasnt able to anymore. then i just found out that she has invited Jeff(the guy i used to like) and so its gonna be a them at a concert alone. And he has a girl friend. And it really hurts cause it was some of the people i cared about the most!!   Sorry, that probably sounded SO seventh grade and stupid but idk. Its just tough cause i am still trying my hardest getting over a guy who really made me feel happy and he respected me, not many guys do that. He was literally just that cool, but now i am rambling! Should i confront her about what i feel about the situation!   Any advice? Thanks for reading :]

And I just tell him, he doesn't need to spend things on me in return. I don't think there always needs to be an equal plane with things, and I don't mind gifts. But is it cheap if I just tell him that I don't really want much from him in return? I'm just being honest to him. Plus, I know he's tight with money, and he doesn't really need to spend things on me. I just tell him, it's ok. It's not like I give him ALL the things he wants and every single item is expensive.

20090309183406AAOJwhM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need some ideas for penalties to be used for a bet between 2 girls and 2 guys?	My GF & I were talking with our best friends, also bf &gf and the conversation turned to the athletic ability of guys and girls. After a lot of debate it was decided that we would in effect create our own biathlon (running and swimming) guys vs. girls. One girl and one guy would run a two mile course and then the other guy and girl would swim four laps in the college pool. The winner is the team that finishes first but the girls will get a 30 second head start at the beginning of the road race. If the girls win the race then the guys will do whatever they tell us to do and if the guys win the girls will do whatever we tell them to for one weekend beginning on a Friday and ending on Sunday evening. What we agreed to do is post the terms of the bet here and ask for ideas for penalties for both the guys and the girls. What we want are penalties that make it very obvious that the losers are paying penalties. To that end with the exception that no one gets hurt and the penalty does not break the law anything goes no matter how humiliating.      In case anyone is thinking of things to do outdoors we live in the south near the water and the weather is already in the 80s.

20090309182442AAirc5P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DOES HE LiKE ME OR NOT?	ok well theres this boy in my grade that i have a HUGE crush on, and i have liked him for like 2 years..so heres my story type-ish thing lol.......      well it started when are parents introduced us at my 4th of july party last year((were family friends)) and like the whole time i caught him looking at me, and one time we were in my pool and a bunch of kids were  playing sharks in minos, and when i was swimming across and jokingly tried to push me under. but it didnt work verry well cuz im like 4 inches taller than him. and then at that school that year ( 6th grade) we barely saw each other cuz we were in different parts of school, but on the last day of school we had an hour to just walk around and get people to sign out yearbooks, so me and friend were just hangin out in the halls and he came up to us, and asked my friend if he could sign her  yearbook, and then he just looked at me, smiled and walked away, WiTHOUT SiGNiNG MiNE!!!! and then that summer,  he was at my cousins( who is also my grade,and their friends ) 4th of July party, and like every once in a while he would talk to me, and then i was in their basement texting someone, and he came  up to me and was like is that the LG Shine??? and i was like ya, then he asked if i could do that mirror thing with the screen, so i did and he was like cool and smiled then i walked away. so then later that summer he slept over that same cousins house and i had to sleep over to becuz my parents were goin on a mini vaca. so then for dinner we had tacos and he was like "so do u like tacos, and i was like ya i love them, then he was like, me too".. then the next day we went to this banquet thing, and he brought his skateboard, and i was like wow your really good and he asked if i could skateboard, and i said well i can move and turn but that it, so then he let me try and teached me how to do an ollie(i wasnt very good lol).and  then later that day, we went to some relatives house and he was there( he spent the whole day with my cousin) and everyone went swimming except my cuz i didnt have a bathing suit. so i just like walked around the pool and put my feet in, and a couple time he squirted water at me, and then i eventually jumped in with my clothes and chased him around the pool( we were just jokingly fighting), and then later that night he and my cousin had a skating competition and he asked me  to be the judge, and i said that he was better, and he gave me a quick hug.   then this year he is in my math and english class, and at the beggining of the year we sat next to each other in class and he was always talking to me( i guess you could call it flirting) and getting me to laugh,and the teacher was always yelling at us for being soo loud. and when we saw each other in the halls he was always smiled at me, and then once after school i was staying for cross country and he was staying for soccer, so i was walking out of the locker room and he did that little gun type hand motion, with the i winking thing, and the noise you make with your mouth to me((( really bad description thing i know, but its like what you would do if you were 'checking someone out')))   so anyway then after both our practices i was walking through the gym and was sooo tired that i asked one of my friends if she could get my bag, but she said she would but she had to leave, and wasnt going that way, so then he was like   "ya francesca, shes not going that way" like in that joking type way   and then when we were moved away from each other in math we barely ever talked anymore. and like a few months later when i just got back from being sick, i kept coughing so he was calling me 'diseased' and then later on i went to the nurse to give her a permission slip and he past by as i was walking in and he was like " your going home again?"so i said no and he was like " oh good"   and then we just talked like every once in a while.   then last week i went away on vacation to hawaii and i asked one of my friends for his cell number. so i texted him and he was being friendly and asking how my vacation was, and about my arm(i sprained my elbow) and then it kinda got awkward cuz we were both just like lol and lol so he just was like k, so i didnt text him back cuz i didnt want to be annoying, and then the next day that same friend dared me to ask him out, so i texted him saying that i was dared  to ask him out so he could just say no (cuz i didnt wanna be embarresed if  he rejected me)  and he never texted me back, so then i asked my friend and my cousin that was his friend to text him, and they both said he didnt answer. so i just guessed there was something going on with his phone. and then the NEXT day i texted him again  and he still didnt answer, so then today in school he didnt talk to me, but in our classes i saw him look over at me a few times and when i looked back he just quickly turned away. and he also a little more popular then me me, and he flirts and hangs out with alot of other more popular girls,

Do you think he still cares, the other dai he wrote on his pm: living the single lyfe?

20090309183246AAJVWwJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why has my best friend grown apart from me?	Ok, long story:      Basically i was best friends with this girl while we were in high school and we were dating for a time. We have regularly hooked up every now and then over a period of about 4 years, but ultimately we were extremely close. I told her everything and she was the only person i trusted. We spent hours together talking and we just clicked. Her humour and my humour were one and the same. I just fell in love with her personality. She knew that although we were friends, i had very strong feelings for her but she always suggested she felt the same way.   For some reason though, she would never commit to a relationship.   Last summer when we had left school i asked her what her feelings were and she said to me... "i really like you, in that way... but i dont want to be in a relationship because i don't want to ruin our friendship" Now obviously i can understand that but i dont think it would have ruined the friendship as our friendship was that strong.   We ended up going to the same university together and after hooking up with her again a couple of weeks in, she has since changed.   She is now with a different guy and does not even speak to me anymore. I respect she might be with this guy and that obviously she doesn't have as much time anymore but i feel very hurt to have been chucked aside like this.   My first year in university has been miserable. Although i have many friends, i have no best friend and i feel as if a part of me is missing. Whereas before she would always notice if i was down, she now seems none the wiser. I am so depressed these days and have been for the past 6 months now. The situation is hurting me so much i am seriously considering leaving my university and going somewhere else just to get away from her. I just do not know what to do to get her back. I don't understand how she can go from telling me how much she likes me and spending so much time with me to now basically not even acknowledging i exist. People from my past know me as a comedy value guy who always has a smile on his face and is up for a laugh, but whereas i also regarded myself as this before, i am now very depressed and cannot see a way out of it. People have told me that she just used me all those years and loved the attention she was getting and that now there is someone else i am nothing to her anymore. Is this true? HELP!

20090309184005AAQM1Sv	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with this? Suggestions pls.?	OK, so i was out sick on mon and tues of last week. thought i had a cold.  by weds am i was really, really sick and didn't show up to work.  had meetings on thurs and fri (professional job) and didn't show because i was really, really sick with the flu and couldn't even get out of bed... got dehydrated... high fever. Only told one person at work on weds that i was getting worse.  Now here comes the hard part....      I thought i had great relationships with friends at work. I've worked there 3 years. I get invited to things all the time. we spend great time together. I care about and love them.  I thought they were my friends. I do things with and for them all the time.  SOOOOO how come when I didn't show up at work, no one contacted me to see if I was all right?  I ended up in the hospital and nearly died, and a week after I took my first day off, no one has contacted me to see if I'm OK.      Since I work long hours, work is where I build most of my friendships.         How the heck does someone deal with the fact that no one cared enough to check on me and see if I was OK?  How do I go back to work and act like it didn't even bother me?

20090309190659AAjQOXE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you give good love advice please help me with this prob?	Hey im a 15 year old girl in high school and ive liked this guy for about 11 months now & he knows i like him. We havent ever been together or anything but he was the 1st guy to ever give me that kinda attention, or hit on me. He was my 1st kiss and 1st guy to ever tell me i was pretty. A few days after we kissed, i thought i wud finally have my 1st bf i was so happy so i asked him if he wud wanna b 2gether. he said no. He said he doesnt wanna b in a relationship because he has stuff to take care of.All that was last school year. I thought of him all summer. He started to like me and tried to kiss me and i didnt let him kiss me cuz my cousin says dont let him use you. After that i got really worried, being psycho thinking he prolly doesnt like me now. I went to the school councelor & told her about everything from the start. She said i know him personally,  do you want me to talk to him? I said yes hoping things would be better since i really havent liked anyone more than him. After she told him,and after that i cud tell he didnt like me that much anymore. He said i just wanna b friends :( ...ANYWAY a month ago i looked prettier and dressed nice and he came up to me and said "so yea we should talk more" The day after that he did talk to me, but the following weeks, he didnt try to talk to me anymore. He doesnt come up to me anymore and doesnt seem to even care. I found out he has a gf too </3 Sometimes i get soo shy & nervous when i am around him. I love him soo much but what sucks is how he cant see how great i really am =[ Im really really fun. Hes gonna graduate this year and im gonna miss him with all my heart. I barley get to see him at all.    And out of this whole situation, i get soo regretful and get s mad at myself thinking you ruined it! TWICE! Once by being shy and twice by saying yes when the councelor asked to talk to him! I blew it with the guy i like soo much. Ive NEVER liked anyone more than him. He will never want to be with me now and i dream of him everyday...   Did i ruin everything? I feel like such a lozer....      Sorry for the long read...Thanks so much guys<3
20090309192741AARpbVC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I help my friend meet guys when I'm taken?	Kind of awkward situation: my friend was dating someone a few months ago, and he introduced me (single at the time) to his really good friend. Now, they aren't together anymore, and we are. It's a little awkward! I don't consider myself single anymore, but she is... and she is really looking for someone new. It's almost a little desperate, but I feel awful and want to help her meet someone.      Thing is, I only get to see my guy on the weekends so I'll see her during the week, and him on the weekends usually. She gets kind of bummed out because we used to go out a lot together and meet guys, and now I don't really want to do that anymore. If I do go out with her, how can I help her meet people without flirting with guys/being bored at the bars?

She's had guys get into fistfights over her, and I have none. Do guys seriously prefer girls with a size C over size A? (Bra size.)   And while your answering, out of curiosity, for guys, what bra size do you prefer?

20090309185155AAu12j7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is such a weird situation. HELPPP?	Okay, so I really really like this one guy. He's 15 and I'm 14, we're both in eighth grade. He sometimes totally flirts with me like...   -pushing me around in rolling chairs   -telling me to feel his hands because they're soft   -putting his hand on me leg   -helping me with technology and asking me for help when he got it      But then, his sort-of friend that's in our tech class came up and asked if I liked him. I said no even though I did and still do. Then he kinda stopped flirting for a couple days, now he on-and-off does. The only problems are...   -I think he might just think I like him so he wants to see if I'll let him do that stuff   -His little sister is one of my best friends   -He always sits next to this one girl at lunch.      I know the one he sits next to is not his girlfriend. His sister invited me over (I couldn't go) but today he asked why I didn't go over. I'm not sure if he likes me or not. I don't want to embarrass myself if he doesn't but I want him to know I like him if he does. I text his sister and if I ask for his number, she'll find out easily. What do you think?   xoxo?      P.S.   He also leans REALLY close to me in health class. We're learning about... uhhmmm... reproduction.
20090309185457AAni85i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he stare at me?	Theres this guy in one of my classes.. one day we were sitting in a circle, and i looked over at him and he was staring at me... very weridly, he looked, kind of... absorbed, yet not as tense, ya know what i mean? and he was staring staight into my eyes, and he never looked away when i looked at him. he has a girlfriend too!! he just looks at me when i walk by in the halls, but in class he makes jokes (idk if he is usually being that funny) and when i looked at him and laugh he is always looking at me!! i might be paranoid (cause i might like him, idk) but down tell me if i am just give your opinion on what you think this means. :)
20090309193639AADda2S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which Guy Would You Choose? (girls preferred)?	GUY A - He's sweet, mysterious, nice, smart, handsome, popular. His friends are friends with mine (some of them are dating my friends). He sometimes can get angry over something not so big, but he cools down quickly and will laugh about it later. He is very charming but can sometimes be shy while other times be larger than life. I remember one time he acted like a cowboy in front of the whole school! He is a little bit flirty, and really, really handsome. Even my mom said he was a hunk. xD      GUY B- He's funny, class clown, loves to read, smart, weird in a cute way. He randomly hugs people (he's not gay tho) and he's just well... odd. But it's cute.      GUY C- He is really short, we share a lot of moments that we just get and we start laughing, he's a great friend. He hits this nerd though, and I don't really like it. He also is sort of a wannabe.

20090309192957AA7TE4p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told him I stopped liking him in PERSON, good or bad move?	(BonGart: This was all you. Finally I applied the "being direct" thing!) Alright well this guy found out I like him by his cousins telling him bc I was too shy to say it myself. Turns out he "really likes me a lot a lot as a friend and doesn't want anything to change between us." ..He used to sit next to me in class, and after he found out he moved to the other side (lol.) He claims its because it was since his participation grade was slipping from talking a lot he moved, I don't know. Well today I went up to him so nervous, and was like "I dont want you to feel weird around me, I know your cousins said I like you but it was just a little crush and I'm over it now." And he was so nice about it saying "oh no I know I understand I didnt feel weird." I'm not going to lie though, I still DO like him lol but I can't have him think that. (Maybe not as direct as I thought, but I thought I had to do it.) Feedback please, thanksyou.

20090309191940AArgSsY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I help a friend out ?	My husband and I have 3 lines from Verizon Wireless. He uses one for business and one for personal while I use one for personal. My friend, who is 30 and has a daughter, asks me if I can open a phone line for her from AT&T. She had a phone before but her bill got so high that they cut off her line. Now she's asking me if I can start her a line with my name because she can't pay her balance and if she opens a new line, she'll need a security deposit. I feel bad. What am I to do? I asked my husband what he thinks, he said No.      She's usually always asking me for money and for favors. But what should I do? Should I trust her? How should I tell her No without sounding like a b*t*h ??      Thanks a bunch!

There is this girl i like in my class, Ive been friends with her for quite a while, some people know i like her.      But anyways, I can walk up to her and say hi, which is no problem, but i figured out that i was not interesting enough.   All i say when i talk to her is asking her how was your day, and many minor questions that ive already asked her before.   Im not a very good conversationalist, But can anyone think of anything i can say to her that would be interesting, cause i'm afraid she might lose interest if i'm boring when i talk to her.      Sorry its quite long but, i would definitely appreciate the advice. Thanks.

I flirt with her a lot and she flirts too so today I was sitting there and the teacher was talking blah blah and she started doodling on her worksheet. She drew a heart and colored it in and positioned the paper in a way I could easily see it. After 2-4 seconds she flipped the paper over quickly and started doodling other girl things like a sun and dots. Did this mean anything, I always feel like she does things that are meant for me but I don't know. She dressed nicely today in a new outfit as well.

20090309191856AA10CtM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give up on him?	I'm full Asian with just a hint of white, and he is 1/2 white 1/2 Filipino   I've heard from his friends that he likes white girls.      We've only talked like a couple of times,   He has A LOT of girls liking him and hitting on him all the time.   He's really good looking.      When I'm alone I feel like its easier to talk to him   but not in front of his/my friends.      Like today, during passing period, I said hey! do you remember me? and he was like of course i do! and he gave me a hug (we never touched each other before that) (he broke the barrier)   I guess he was just being nice,      But sometimes its awkward when we're with friends.      I heard he likes someone else      From one person I've heard he likes this girl who is Mexican (but is very very pretty)   And I've heard from another that he likes this really pretty white girl.      I know both girls cause we're on the same volleyball team      and he is on the guys volleyball team      Should I find someone else?   and just be friends with him?      I always seem to have the worst of luck with guys.. =[

20090309190725AAzRuYT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I comfort her or give her a reality check?	The story's way to  long to explain in detail, but basically my bff just broke up with her bf a couple months ago and she just can't get over him. Hes cheated on her and worried her so many times, but she has never been mad at him. When he cheated on her, she wasn't mad that he cheated on her, she was worried that they would break up. I just don't understand. And theirs been so many lies thats been badly covered up. anywho... this is her first REAL boyfriend she had two others but  they only lasted a couple months. and this was her first make-out etc. and he fingered her. well... he broke up with her two months ago and for a while they didn't even talk but not they talk as if they are still dating and she hung out with him the other day and he fingered her and crap again, but they're not dating. Now hes "mad" at her again and his name says missing someone, most likely one of his other million girls (funny thing is is that he blocked her so she can't see it) well long story short, shes all sad now and wants my comfort but I keep telling her to forget about him and move on but she can't and she keeps putting herself in the same position.      What should I do?         we are only 15

They're always chatting him up and stuff,and i mean this is even when we're out together.      He always politely declines and says he's taken,but i don't feel safe?   I don't know how to put it,i feel like i could lose him at any moment to a girl who comes along who's prettier or something.      I don't think he'd cheat we've been together 2 years with no problems,but it's like i don't know for certain - there's always this doubt in the back of my mind.   I'd be totally crushed if he left me,and knowing there's plenty of other offers for him isn't helping.         Should i talk to him about it? I don't know if it'd do any good,there's not really a lot more he can do.      Or should i just ignore it? It worries me,but then again i don't think he would cheat or something.I don't know :/

20090309192135AA2wNtW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do relationships that begin as a result of one person having an affair last?	She lied and cheated on him for almost a year with me. Now we are engaged to be married next year. She says that I am a blessing to her. She didn't give her relationship with him a 2nd chance because she wanted to be with me. A buddy of mine asked me had we set a date and I told him when she set it for. He shook his head and when I asked him why, he said that was her ex birthday month. Of all the months she could have chose, I don't know why that one. I know she still communicates with him from time to time and I know they both still have feelings for each other (words came out of their mouths to each other via IM). But I got the feeling she only with him out of gratitude because of everything he'd done for her. Considering how our relationship began, am I in for trouble or am I just being paranoid?

20090309192732AAQaoC4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please just give me some advice about what to do with my relationship?	Ive been in a relationship for about half a year now, and everything was great for the first 3 or 4 months(it always is). Now things have just changed a lot, and usually I would just say that I should get out of the relationship and let it be. I'm sick of running from my problems and i'm starting to think the problem might be me. I dont know about other girls but i cannot stand when guys play video games 24/7. Its literally all my boyfriend does now he plays xbox live for at least 5 hours a day. I CANT STAND IT. we never do anything anymore and going out to dinner has become ordering chinese while he plays games. And the other downside to leaving him is I have become very close with his family, including his son. I love them both so much and I just really dont know what to do.

20090309193826AA1tenF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell if someone is drunk texting you?	My boyfriend texted me a little while ago and told me that he was "tipsy." We continued texting and I told him I was really tired and that I was about to go to sleep. He was like "Ok! Well, love you!" and he asked me a few times "Are you my baby?" and when I said yes, he was like "Aw! You are!" It's not that he never, ever tells me that he loves me, but he just doesn't say it all the time. Is it possible that he was just saying this because he was drunk? Or do you think he means it? He didn't say anything out of the ordinary, like he didn't say anything dirty or anything. He just talked like his usual self. Any help is appreciated! :)

20090309192350AAxD7oF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get out of this lie?	I've been seeing this guy for about two and a half months now and just decided to tell my friends. I didn't mention him earlier because my last relationship was a disaster and I wasn't sure how this one would work out. But I'm crazy about this guy despite him being really busy these days (I only talk to him about once every 2 weeks) but I know that what we have is real. We have this connection that's impossible to explain. All I know is that he's the first guy who has completely captured my heart. I don't want anyone else and talking to other guys just bores me.    I told my friends that he lives closer than he does and lied about the school he goes to. Now one of my friends says that she used to go to the school I said he goes to and she wants to look him up and tell her friends that go to the school about him. I don't know how to get out of this without my friends gossiping and getting upset about me lying to them. I know that I shouldn't have fibbed to begin with but I figured that if I told them he lived closer than he does they would at least be a bit supportive. Help?
20090309193715AAo2gdJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He smart, cute, but does he like me?	Well his name is Travis. And he is extremely shy around me, yet everyone else he's not shy.  I did everything, I helped him with his stuff he droped, I tryed to talk to him but we always can't talk because he always looks at me and talks but when I look at him and we talk his head looks away. Once in gym, Travis was dribbling the basketball and shooting the baskets. Someone took his ball an I offered mine. He blushed very slightly and said "No thanks, I'll put it away for you though." I smiled and blushed "Well I'm gonna keep my ball then thanks anyway". He said "Ok" and walked away. And he stared at me while we were talking! Then my friend elbowed me playfully and winked. Well does he?

Everyone I know has a relationship interest every other week if their single and has been in at least a few. I'm 21 and in college and I have yet to meet anyone. Heres how I see it   1. School: 95% of my classes are straight lecture where nobody talks to anyone the majority of the time.   2. The gym: only girls I see there my age are with their boyfriends.   3. Friends: I havent met any new friends outside the ones I havein a long time so I have little to no ties from them anymore.   4. Asking: asking a complete stranger for a number or date just seems creepy to me.      So i'm not sure what im doing wrong. How does it all work?

20090309192915AAhs00w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Serious question here:  would you date or begin a relationship if you had a terminal diagnosis?	Curious because I have a cousin in her late 20s who has cancer (in remission) but knows she will die in a few months, a year, or years. She has a form that is not curable and will eventually spread and get worse. She does not date at all. But I'm wondering if she found a wonderful guy if it would break her heart to know she couldn't do anything about it. She feels well now but knows she will die in a few months, a year, or few years. It's horribly sad.          What would YOU honestly do? Would you be MORE bold to pursue someone you met of interest and just see if they were interested or would you not want to start anything thinking about how it would be hard for them to have you leave forever?

20090309191458AAnSTAM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know if he likes me..help!! ( long detail..) <33?	I know youve probably heard of a million stories like this..but this is really important to me..   Okay..there's this guy at school and I really really like him.   I don't think he likes me,but every one of my (wierd & idiotic =)) friends says he does.   I used to sit right next to him in class.. but now hes sad..and now Im sad cause hes sad ( but thankfully he seemed happier today =DD)   Anyways.. Every time I look at him he looks at me at the same time and then we both turn our heads (and its sorta embarrassing because I think he might know because of that..)   I act a little wierder around him then I do when Im with my friends but not much..   One of the main things that freaks me out is the farther away I am fro him, the sadder I get and the more I miss him.. (remember me mentioning we used to sit by each other?? Well my teacher moved me because I was always talking.Since I moved weve both been feeling sad.And Kandice *best friend* said "Well yeah we're all sad because she switched you and Lori *other best friend*" and Im like "No hes not, somethings up wrong with him!!" (Hense the horrible excuse) As I think about that one thing more and more its starting to make more sense..(but he still doesnt like me)   I want to ask him whats wrong but I dont want to because it might hint him (plus my friend asked and he made up a horrible excuse..So I dont even know if he would tell me whats wrong ( or what WAS wrong anyway =\)   I get waaaaay too excited whenever I hear someone say his name..(which is a lot..)   And I think of myself as wierd because this has never happened to me before.. (my friends tease me about "being in love". But I believe love is like one of the strongest words there is..)   Sometimes he gives me chills when he walks past me in the hallway (whoa!! o.o)   And I bought a journal and the first page and a half (or first day) is all about him.   I really hope he doesnt find out I like him because that would be embarrassing!!   My friends are encouraging me to ask him out but I dont necesarilly want to because I know he deserves better than me..   And every time I try and explain that to y friends they just shake theyre head.   Soo Im like "you know what?!?! screw it Ill ask on yahoo!answers..   I really need some help.. and especially someone elses point of view other than my best friends..   **PLEASE NO MEAN COMMENT!! ='(**   GUYS & GIRLS opinions welcome!!   Btw!! :: if you read this whole thing then you are the best people on earth.. =)   But it would be a complete waste to read all of this stuff and not even comment (answer) it!!

20090309193515AAaUFha	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUY PROBLEM!!! PLEASE HELP!!!!?	So I got into a huge fight with a guy that I have been dating and we haven't spoken for over a month. And recently I was sitting with my friends in the college lounge and he comes over to us and asks one of my friends a question. We did not talk. But my friends told me that he was looking at me from time to time.      Then this week, he comes to me again and he asks if i still have his papers and I said I did and he said if he could have them back! (By the way the papers are for Calculus, and he already finished with that course)   Then he left and I went after him saying I am sorry for what happened and he told me he would like to be nothing more than friends. He said he was very busy with school work and such. He also said that we either could be friends or if we still were not talking then he would be fine with that. During this time I was VERY nervous!!!! I didnt know what to say and probably babbled on and on.          If he wants to be friends or if he says he doesnt mind NOT being my friend, then why is he making an effort to show up randomly in my face like that, TWICE??? I really need an explanation      Thank you so much   Jill

20090309185822AAV8eKJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do? I am so confused... Urgent help please?	I dated this girl for almost six months, we broke up and then i started talking to a junior at my school. We hit it off from the start, me being a sophomore i thought i had no shot with her but she told me that she liked me etc.. Then we kept talking for about two months. She started talking to a college guy over christmas break and hanging out with him.      During that period she started to like him and me at the same time she said she couldn't decide. Over christmas break i also started talking to my ex again and when i got back into town we hooked up. We kept talking for about another month and then went out again, The whole time i was still talking to the other girl.. and i still had some feelings towards her.       In the middle of january me and the other girl hooked up (the junior) i still had feelings for both girls, she told me that i had messed her and the college guy up and that she couldn't keep doing it so we broke it off for the most part but we kept talking still... the same talking i was talking to my ex.       To make a long story short, i like both of them but i decided i want to be with the Junior girl. The only problem is that she found out that i had been hooking up with my ex and her at the same time. Now she says that she can't trust me or anything, but just last night she snuck over and we hooked up again. It seemed she had forgiven me, i care so much about her... Me and my ex are done, completely. I just wanna know how to get this girl back to trust me and keep it going. She says she is extremely close to breaking things off with the college guy.       WHAT DO I DO!?

There's this girl i really like, but i'm not sure if she likes me as a friend or actually like likes me. To start whenever she gets to class i'm always the first one she talks to. She tells me about the "hilarious" moments she had the last night. Second whenever our teacher or a another student cracks a joke she always smirks at me(it feels like she is checking if i am laughing). Third, when she found out  like her (I told her) she seemed a bit shocked or scared, i couldn't tell. But right after she found out she and her friends always whispered about me when i pass in the halls.I'm not sure if thats a really good thing or a really bad thing.   P.S. We've been good friends for the past 2 years.

20090309191157AA2DtPm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Learn To Take Things Day By Day?	My boyfriend and I broke up just recently because I was unhappy. Granted the break up didn't last a day, but I wasn't happy at all with our relationship and how it was going. (We'll be together a year and a half Friday) But the whole deal was that I am CONSTANTLY stressed out because I am home all the time and I have a lot of time to think. Probably too much. But I think everything can be fixed if I just learn to take things day-by-day instead of jumbling everything together and trying to plan everything. But I am an extremely structured person.

I even try not talking to him but i just think of him even more.PLEASE help me on what should I do, i really need some advice.
20090309191447AAbzg84	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did my friend come out to me?	I have a close friend that I really just started talking to in the past year. He's cool and all, he takes care of himself A LOT and i think he tried to come out to me the other day. Out of nowhere while I'm talking to him at school, he just interrupts, "I'm bi", i stop and ask, what? then he just smiles and says "nothing" and changes the subject, but it wasn't done in any way as if he was trying to cover it up or nervous. I'm so confused, can anyone give me some pointers on how to ask him? I know there's no real easy way to ask someone if they're gay/les/bi whatever but I like to know everything about my close friends and it bugs me that he just left me halfway there. He acts really straight, not feminine at all, likes sports/video games/all the stereotypical guy stuff but he still throws off that vibe of bisexuality. Please give me some suggestions. Thanks

20090309191914AAz5YU0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I asked a girl out a week ago and now have concerns?	I asked this girl out in my college class a week ago and she said she was seeing an old friend right now but said yes, and I gave her number and she added it to her phone. I think really she did that not to be mean, and probably wont call me ,but I give her more time. Meanwhile I am thinking about asking her friend out as well within a few weeks, because I think her friend has a thing for me, and she likes to run and I like to run so I am thinking about asking to run with me in the park sometime. A little bit about me, is I don't develop feelings for a girl until she goes on a date with me, so I don't get hurt. To me love someone, the someone must love you back. But I don't know if this girl has a bf or will it hurt her feelings that I asked her friend out first, but I will be honest with her if she gives me a chance. So how will I know if this girl likes me not just kindness? How do I know if she is available? Or should touch it because of the friends thing? And How should I go about it?

After that, I saw him at school a lot but since he is in a grade lower than me (and I don't have any classes with him) I've never had an actual conversation with him. I looked on his facebook profile and started to develop a crush on him. I was too shy to approach him at school, so I sent him an honesty box message on valentine's day. He didn't reply so I thought that the message freaked him out and I tried to get over him. A couple hours ago (which is almost a month later), he replied with "awwe, thanks so much".   What the hell??   What am I supposed to do?

20090309193620AAZXftp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested?! Am i wasting my time!? Help please!?	A few weeks ago, I noticed I was very attracted to a guy at my school.  After seeing him a few times afterwards, I started getting butterflies.  Him and I were aquaintances, and have been for a little over a year, but I wanted to get to know him more.  So one day he was on facebook so I started a conversation.  He added me on msn and we started talking.  From there, we started talking a bit more at school.    The other day my school was holding a fashion show, and he asked me if I was going.  I wanted to but I couldn't get a ride home, so he offered to walk me (at 11pm on a Thursday night, and it is an hour walk, to my house, then back to his).  It turns out that I couldn't go, but he have me his number to call or text him whenever I wanted.  When he got home from the fashion show I asked how it was, and he said it was alright, but it would have been better if I was there.  After that we were discussing hooking one of my friends up with a good guy but there was no one in my grade good enough for her.  He said in return " aww dont worry if you fall i can be the ground you fall on and i will always help you back up".      ....The only issue is, I am always the one that has to start a convo, or text him first, otherwise we wouldn't talk.  He could be one of those people who never starts a convo on msn first, but I'm not sure.         Does he seem interested?  Is he just being friendly?  Should I act on anything or just stay friends?

We have been going out for about 6 months, we are both nearing the end of  High School, and we have a really good relationship I think.

Sometimes it seems like a chore for me to kiss her and stuff, but I know she likes it.  I have been dealing with a lot of issues like depression and anxiety, and I really am not that attracted to Anyone anymore.

I want to have sex with him,    how do I get him to make the first move?

In the past there have been things which made my husband not like my parents. His belief right now is when my father asks me for any financial help my husband will not help him. In the past my husband has taken financial help from my father several times. I am a housewife and my husband is working. Is the son-in law supposed to help wife's family or there is no obligation even though the son law has taken favors from in laws?

20090309194028AAqoGhQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women, how many times do you get approached daily?	I am recently single and so I've been approaching a lot more women lately. Funny thing, after talking to these women they say they rarely get approached during the day.    Also the better looking they are, usually the less they say they get hit on during the day.      At night, it's a different story, but I want to know how many times women get approached by guys during the day if ever?

I quietly moved away to the other side of the bar, and came back a half an hour later and acted as if I knew about nothing that had happened.      And then I started hitting on her. Was that OK? I got her email.

I cook, I clean, i do the laundry, I handle a majority of the finances... and still, still he's saying he doesn't get respect! are you kidding me!  The man can't open his eyes to see what he's got, its like he ignores the fact that I do all this stuff... when I point it out to him all the things that I do. he just writes it off. doesn't say thank you, doesn't show appreciation... i get nothing in return!      So my plan.... he can do his own laundry, he can cook his own food and he can feel the pressure of handling the finances.... what do you think? is this a good plan?       Seriously... I am really frustrated with this, I put so much work into the everyday duties and responsibilities here and I feel like I get nothing in return, not even a gratitude of appreciation for it... I feel like he thinks he's some sort of king and just deserve it... I'm trying to burst his bubble here, my life goal/plan was not to serve any man... and especially for lack of appreciation.  I do what I do because otherwise it wouldn't be done!  know what I mean?  advice please... comments... whatever your thinking..,.
20090309201853AAKGB34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Age difference question?	I had already asked what people thought of a 22 year old male dating a 17 year old female and they all said it was perfectly fine. But I was thinking, and it's actually illegal, isn't it? I think people would give weird looks if a 22 year old was interested in a 17 year old just because the female is "underage". Thoughts?

I moved in last week with my bf, but since then he never seems to want to do anything with me besides cuddling and then sleeping. So I asked him if I wasn't sexually appealing and he said, "It has nothing to do with you, I'm just not into sex"      How can you not be into it? Sure he's a virgin, but this is not NORMAL! Does he need medical help or am I just not appealing enough for him to be aroused!
20090309203605AApJBxI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the women, are virgin men a turnoff?	Would you want to date a guy that is planning to stay a virgin until he's in a very serious relationship, or possibly even marriage? I'm a good looking guy, 20 years old, 6'7" 245 lbs muscular/toned build, black hair blue eyes. I'm extremely smart and nice too. It just seems like all the girls I meet are just looking for one night stands or short flings, when I'm not like that at all. I've had drunk girls try to come back to my place more than once but I don't want to have sex until I'm in love with the girl. I want to find a girl that's looking for something serious, but it's hard to find. So if your a girl that's had sex before would a guy that choses not to have sex be a turnoff?
20090309201935AAd4kRN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How was it all a lie, my fiance is in JAIL?	he had a drug problem over 4 years ago, that's why we broke up, b/c I wasn't dealing w/ it.  He got clean, was was clean for 4+ years, he was nearly off of parole for what I thought was stupid mistakes he made when he was younger.  He was a month from being off parole, and got new charges, basically he stole to get money for drugs. I found out when he was arrested.  We did not live together so that's why he was able to hide it from me.  He did start acting differently, I did suspect something was up w/ him, but nothing like this.  I do love this man, but I know he is no good, and I will not be second best to his addiction, why does he chose this lifestyle over a potentially amazing normal life????

Basically, I've been friends with this guy for about a year and half (Quite a long time in Middle School) and lately, everyone is freaking out saying that he likes me. They say this because:   A) I'm the only girl he hugs everyday.   B) He lets me call him funny names and doesn't care (Which he does when other people do).   C) He attempts to be nice another one of my friends who he dislikes, all because he knows that the fact they hate each other makes me sad.   D) He recently came up to me and we had this conversation-   "Hey, what's going on, O short one?"   "Not much. Your hair is different,"   "It's called a straight-iron,"   "Oh, well, you look prettier with curls," Then he turned really red and laughed nervously.   Does he like me? I'm really not too sure.

20090309202833AAB3Bft	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How come guys only want one thing from me?	I don't dress slutty. In fact, I  try to dress in a way that makes me fit in to the culture...all covered up. But when I least expect it, there's some guy trying to touch me, then bragging to his buddies that there's some easy girl he's never seen before. What's the deal with that? Oh, I'm not from india, but even if I don't act like what they see on tv about western women, the stereotype still prevails, and well...I got used. I got married first, so technically I wasn't a "whore". But still, just because I come from a permissive society, indian guys think they can toss me around. Y? I don't act the part. Sure, I talk to guys, but not nasty. On the net it's different, but no one knows me. But out in india, I'm different. Shy mostly because I'm uncomfortable. But no, since I'm an NRI, I get type casted n blacklisted, n some get offended when I say no...as if they're gods gift to women.

My sister wants to go to this fancy smancy (lolz) boutique this week that;s having a really good sale that she saw in the paper. The only catch is that it's on my ex's side of town...more specifically right next to where he works (no details bout him needed, just something that had to end). I haven't had to go anywhere near that side of town in about six months.       For all my grown people who know the rules, know that if you're serious about distancing yourself from someloser then you have to avoid areas where they might be. You don't accidentally show up somewhere you know they'll be, pretending to be surprised that they're there (take note teenagers).       I've been good. I've moved on. I love shopping sales. So zip in & zip right back out?

I'm looking for honest answers. So do you think she would love this? Can you suggest a title for it too? The one I've in mind is "A Wish".      Lost into each others eyes,with hands so closely held,   Cozy smiles on our faces,we lay on the flower bed!   The dewdrops falling over,sound like the church bell,   Then your eyes open wide,seeing the lovely sea shell!   Wondering what is inside,your hands are shaking,   Tears cloud in our eyes,our hearts start racing!   As we shake the seashell,pops-out a beautiful ring,   Twinkling and sparkling,our hearts begin to sing!   I slide it onto your finger,and it fits you perfectly,   No words are being said,as we are kissing gently!   Even if it is just a dream,Love is all I wish for you,   Standing by you I wish,your dreams do come true!

In fact, he lost his job after the company closed down. I have not heard from him since I saw him on Saturday.

Guys, do you like to spend alot of time alone just being with your girlfriend as opposed to hanging out with her in a group of people? Does she ever ask "can we go on a walk", or "lets go sit outside"? My girlfriend Jessica and I like to spend alot of time just sitting, walking and talking together. One of our favorite things to do is to sit on her roof as the sun is setting and just talk about things that have been happening... Weird it may sound, but it is actually a pretty cool thing. We also like to go on walks around a lake near our house. Any other guys do this kind of thing with their girls?

20090309202226AAUs7iy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wondering if I'm overwhelming my boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years.  We rarely fight, we've been relatively happy together, and we're both in college.  He lives four hours away.      Here's the thing.  A lot of things are happening in my life (parents are losing house, might be moving 7 hours away to find work, my tuition can't be paid and I don't know if I'm going to school next quarter).        It's a lot for me to handle, especially because my mom depends on me for emotional support.  I feel like I'm the mom and she's the daughter.  Although I'm not making enough money to support myself yet, I do everything I can to be as little of a burden financially for my parents as possible.        I feel like my life is too dramatic for other people to handle, especially my boyfriend.  I tell him what's going on, and he never knows what to say - not that I expect him to.  I just feel like I'm weighing him down.  Lately I've been quiet and sad, and it's bad because he's loud and always the center of attention.  I wonder if we're a bad match...      More than that, I keep having dreams about being with other people (imaginary and real), and that my boyfriend is with someone else too.        Basically, I'm wondering if I should break up with my boyfriend because I don't want him to share my stress.  Also, I guess I'm wondering if we would be happier with other people.  I'm so stressed out right now, I don't want to make a brash decision.  Any outside advice?

Why is it these guys I know are able to get gf but I can't?   --These are not friends, just guys I work with or friends of friends.      1st guy: GF found out he goes to strip clubs with friends often. She let it slide. Later found out he had been looking at porn on computer. Again, let it slide.   2nd guy: Repeatedly puts his gf down. Never respects her, tells her she is stupid, etc, She is now engaged to him.   3rd guy: Cheated on gf with her best friend of 20 years for 2 months. She no longer talks to her best friend but she is now married to him.   4th guy: He treats his gf like a slave. He doesn't even get his own coffee in the morning. She has to get it for him.

I know its the 21st century and woman no longer have to sit and wait for the guy to approach us but a female making the first move is simply not my forte. Until last week that is; I was hanging out at a bar with friends and saw this really really ridiculously good looking guy, now while most guys in the lounge were offering me drinks and trying to talk to us, he didn't even look our way or even notice us. Heck he didn't seem to notice anybody for that matter he was just in his own zone. This intrigued the hell out of me in a way I never felt and so I had to get him...I saw him dancing an walked right up and started dancing with him and he looked up at me and smiled, then we both talked, he asked for my number walked me to my car and gave me a goodnight kiss (not tongue but like a cute peck) bla bla an then he didn't call the next day...so the day after that I text him and he wrote back and we text back and forth a few times until he called and made plans to hang out this thursday...now is this totally cool or am I not giving him space to chase me lol i figured cut the bs we are adults here no more game playing..ok sorry this was long
20090309201323AAMWyN8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Actually, the questions should be "Does she like me?" but i had 2 hav 20 characters.   I need to know...lemme tell you details.   I see her every weekend twice. Saturday and Sunday. She works at a donut shop and that's when i see her.      1. First time I saw her, she immediately asked my name and age.      2. Everytime we meet, she always "Hi [my name]" and "bye [my name]      3. She begs me to but more stuff and even offered 2 pay once.      4. Once I added her as a friend and she immediately messaged me "hey it's you"      5. i once did not show up to the donut shop, and she asked me why i didn't go      6. I gave her a $10 and she jokingly refused to give me $5 dollars back change.      7. She once messed up my name and looked so embarrassed, she turned her back to me for a second kind of laughing      So does she? I have a feeling she does, but im not completely sure.   I thought writing in a list would be easier to read than reading a long paragraph lol.   Thanks   Real Answers Only

Anyways, so when I got home from school today, I heard from my friend that goes to his school that this morning, he was talking to all his friends about me and telling them he really liked me, and then at first recess, he asked out this other girl! One of my other friends who goes on his bus saw him kissing the girl too. I am just so confused right now! Why would he tell me and all his friends he likes me, and then go out with another girl??

20090309201118AA5VCaH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband cheating?	Today i received my telephone bill and it was outrages.i could not believe how high it was.i decided to look over it line by line thinking that the phone company probably screwed up.there was a number that appeared almost everyday,from 30 minutes to 4 hours.i asked my husband who it was and he insisted it was a friend,but it is very hard to believe because he had been erasing his call logs and that for one is suspicious to me,second he talked to her after midnight lots of times.He got furious when i told him i was going to his job to confront this person,he told me that i was going to embarrass him,i don't understand why. i should be the one feeling like that cause i know that she knows he is married.i have been calling her all day and she has not picked up all day.im seriously thinking about leaving him because i was raised to not put up with this kind of behavior from a man.
20090309194249AAM1vLn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's up with my problem?	I literally have no confidence, game, whatever you want to call it, when it comes to girls. I can't even go up to girls I know and have a decent conversation with them. I don't think looks are a problem; I'm not the best looking dude around but I'm in pretty good shape and strong as hell (on the wrestling team ). I just don't understand why I can't believe in myself.
20090309210338AAFlSfK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I losing her?? What should I do?	Okay so there is this girl i never really talked to, but then i started and we really started to like each other and then i accidentally said something to piss her off but she says shes over it now. Its like she has lost all interest in me, and all I said was that she acts a little different in public than in private.      I keep trying to get her alone to talk about it but every time i get a chance she has "Homework" or she has to call one.. its like she is avoiding me for some reason i dont get. I see her in the hallway and make eye contact and smile but she like looks away really quick and i dunno what it means.      She liked me before and we got over the awkward stage so it was all going ghreat.. but since the problem i havent felt like im connecting with her, she wont answer any serious texts and wont talk on the phone. Im seriously about to give up but i just dont know what the issue is and i kind of want to know before i drop her... or get dropped by her.      I just cant figure it out.. but i asked a good friend of hers a while back and she asked me if i liked her... at the time i was confused and i said no, so I am thinking maybe she said something and now she is afraid to talk to me because she doesnt want to like me??      what do you think I should do? Or what do you think her problem with me is?
20090309195942AAMKmib	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am confused and need help about a guy?	Ok..well this guy and I have been pretty good friends all through middle school.  Just recently I started liking him and he started liking me.  We would stay up for hours talking on the phone and through IM.  We told each other everything.  Then he asked me to the dance and Lock In afterward.  We slow danced and hung out.  That was Friday and now it is Monday.  He like ignored me at school.  I kept see him staring at me, but he never talked to me.  He spent the whole day talking to his best friend who happens to be a girl.  And then tonight he sent me one e-mail.  Does this mean he doesn't like me anymore?
20090309200208AA6IyN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Promise ring help.10 points!?	first thanks for looking at my question.well I love my girlfriend so much and I know she feels the same way.I rele want to ask her to be my wife , but I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of commitment being that I'm so young and I don't want to hurt her. I've already asked her parents If they were ok with me asking her to be my wife and her mom started crying and then hugged me for like three minutes and her dad shook my hand and gave me a hug as well , so i guess that means they approve. But should I give her a promise ring and tell her in a year or two I will give her a real ring? and If I should get her a promise ring can you help me with the style and give me a link to picture? thanks oh and below there's a pic of the engagement ring im planning on giving her when I'm ready.

20090309205449AAtaFeM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl I like rubs boyfriend in my face?	Ok, so about 2 months ago, i had a class with her. we got to be REALLY close friends, but she had a boyfriend. we have this really weird schedule for school, we get diffrent classes every quarter. anyhoo, she broke up with her boyfriend, and was a mess for about a week. i did what i could do to comfort her. then, the quarter ended. now, i only get to see her durring passing period once, (or if im lucky) twice a day. also, we have the same lunch, but we dont hang out together. she used to act real into me, up untill around Valentine's day, when she got a new boyfriend (so um, i see why shes not too into me anymore). now, shes completely ignoring me. i feel lucky to get a "hi" from her anymore. about 3 days ago, se started showing off her boyfriend, and rubbung him in my face a little. im not angry, just,disappointedd in her, that she would do such a thing. she knows where i hang out, and she'll show up, like, 50 feet away, with her boyfriend, and start making out with him. why would she be doing that? is it to give me the subliminal middle finger, or to make me jealous, and have me make m move when she breaks up? i hate trying to understand the female mind. its too complecated for me. lol...      also, dont call her a jerk. i know her better than that. trust me, shes not.
20090309200733AAfpVha	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So do i still have a chance?	i've known this guy for almost a year, we work next to each other and we went out on a date a month ago. we had a really good time i even got to kiss him a few times. but a few days later i said something that sounded like i was rushing things when i actually meant something else. so its been a month and things are a little different we dont talk outside work like we used to and things seemed a little awkward. i was told that i should act aloof and vague with him. so last week i figured id not initiate a conversation or anything and just act well aloof. up until yesterday i didnt talk to him or see him for a week.       so heres what happened: yesterday i went in to get a couple of drinks for me another girl. i didnt see him but as i was walking out he came out of a bathroom. i just gave him a look and continued to walk away. i was walking back to where i work when he stepped outside to shout at me 'oh so youre just look at me then walk away yeah i saw that' later on i was over there to get a little something to eat before i left, and i didnt see him again. i was talking to another guy that was there when the guy i liked yelled at me from a table he was sitting at along with a couple of his friends. i looked at him smiled slightly and turned back around. he then came to stand beside me to ask for a small fry basket and elbowed me a little saying i could wait for my food. he got a large basket and when he said he wanted a small one i said well go around and get one, you work here. he hit my head with the basket. so do you think hes warming back up to me? i think he his, he hasnt acted that way towards me in awhile. my bestfriend seems to think that its a good sign what do you think?
20090309195206AAcpFhq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i say to him?	i havent talked to him really in 5 years idk what to say cuz he wants to talk on the phone because its easier than text and blah blah blah      lol anything would be helpful

20090309203238AARhrol	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At first he called constantly, now he doesn't why?	I told him that I was not looking for anything, but he continued to tell me that he loved me (after a month or so). Then wants to know where I am, but I can't ask him where he has been. He will take my keys so that I can not leave him. I would tell him that I have to go home, but he decides to keep my keys and phone, saying that he wants me to be with him everynight. It's only been about 3 months, and I don't know how to continue? Should I continue? I mean should I try to be with him? He didn't call me today, so is he really worried about me being with another?

He texted me before and now he doesn't respond to mine.      Idk, i just don't understand why he's doing it. Any tips?   thank you

I was sitting in class and was partnered up with a boy that i have a small crush on; nothing major right,  but then i sat on the side of him and i began to like get really nervous & i had nothing to say & i always have something to say. & he was really quiet too (long story short but in middle school he had a crush on me too) so anyyyhoo he lemme copy his notes cos he had them all already which was cool, &&& the whole time im thinking "you smell terrrrrrrrificccc!" and then i started thinking if i should mention that he smelled good out loud or about his new class (cos we use to have another class together) and i didnt say anything...   should i have?

I am just curious   How much do you girls have a orgasm (per day, and if not per day but per week, per month, etc.)   and when you do masturbate what do you usually think off, and what gets you so horny?   And have you ever watched porn?   and why do you watch (same reason as guys)   And if you see (for example a hot guy, and you can see his abs, do you get turned on, or is it something else)   just tell   thanks, just trying to undestrand the opposite sex:)

20090309210423AAmweI2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok so why is nobody interested? (pic included)?	Ok I just turned 16 and by telling you this, I'm sure that many of you are rolling your eyes. I've never had a girlfriend but I don't understand why I don't draw at least some interest. I mean I'm not great but I'm not horrible either.      Anyway I guess I'm a typical guy. I'm not too too athletic, and I am a bit smart and I guess kinda nerdy to an extent but I don't understand why that's a bad thing?      I'm down to earth and I think I'm a nice person. I'm always willing to help anybody with anything. Maybe I'm too nice sometimes but again, is that really a turn off?      And here's a pic:  http://s554.photobucket.com/albums/jj434...       I don't think I'm too bad looking. I'm no George Clooney, but I'm not ugly either.      I have braces also so i'm not sure if that's a factor, and I sometimes have some facial acne but it's really not that bad ever and I've seen it overlooked by girls on several occasions. So any ideas why nobody's interested? Honesty is appreciated.
20090309200649AAfHIsO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused, loved or not? What do you think?	So I have been with this guy for over 2 years.  I feel like I love him, but we keep breaking up.  Well it only comes from his side.   Sometimes I feel like he loves me, but I don't know.  We live together, but he still can't commit to be my boyfriend even after we moved in together.  Becasue we broke up last January and he we got back together in November.  He asked me to marry him.  Then he started to try to cheat, so I broke up with him, we still live together && Everything is still there, even sex and dates and everything.  But he just doesn't want the status of a relationship.      WHy?  What should I do?  I feel like i am wasting my time, but I love him too much to let go.  We are both almost 19 and graduated.

But lately my husband has been bringing up the subject about having kids. I still don't want them. But he suggested surrogacy. I’m not sure about this. He been looking on the net about this, and reading up on this. I don’t like the whole idea. I don’t want my marriage to break up over this issue. But how do I persuade him to drop the whole idea?  I’m 33 my husband is 39.

I looked and narrowed down to two places. The first was a guy and his place was nice and really easy going - a good roommate. The other was two girls also very nice easy to get along with. Both were equally rated in my mind. Would I be better off with renting from the girls or the guy? The only issue is the one girl gave the strong vibe that she is very interested in me. She is very pretty. Should I steer away from renting from the girls if this turns into something else? Would it be a problem you think for the other roommate if it did?

20090309210356AAIUwNt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people assume I am a **** because I hang out with just guys?	I have had people call me a **** and it is really annoying. I only hang out with guys, because girls are such backstabbers and I am sick of it.  I will be walking around in a group of five of six guys and people are always looking at me funny, and whispering when I walk by. They didn't do this before I started hanging out with just guys. I am dating one of the guys, and we have been dating for three years. I usually ignore it, but it is so annoying. Why do they think I am a **** just because I hang out with just guys. Other girls aren't jealous, because the guys aren't really popular, and not the best looking, their just really nice.

Would you think I was 2 easy? would that ruin the chances of having a date with him?

I caught my boyfriend cheating on me for the second time (that I know of for sure) It isn't as simple as he wont change so I should leave him.  I'm pregnant and if I leave I will have to put my baby in daycare almost immedietly and go back to work. Maybe that makes me seem lazy but i just don't think that a neworn should be in daycare, i think he should be at home with mom. If I stay he will let me stay home for atleast 6 months, if I leave he probably won't do that but then I have to deal with a cheating boyfriend. What should I do? I need him financially and I can't live off of child support.

There's a guy that I've had my eye on since the beginning of the semester, I haven't told him that i like him yet. On the other hand there's my friend whom of which i am certain likes me. At first i was certain that if he asked me out i'd gently let him down, but now I'm not so certain because I'm starting to have feelings for him. But i still like this other guy and would regret it if i don't act on my feelings. What should i do? i really like the first guy but I'm starting to like my friend.

20090309195911AATzcZ2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Asking a girl at work out?	So, I worked with this girl for about 6 months. She all of a sudden quit and her last day is Wednesday. I’ve talked to her at work whenever I worked with her and a little on IM but no super deep conversation. She is a senior in high school and is two years younger than me. I went to the same high school as her and we have a lot of mutual friends but never hung out together. And so on whensday on her last day I planned on going in and asking her on a casual date because I figure I have nothing to lose seeing as I may never see her again. I also found out she is interested in older guys(which I am) and guys who can take care of themselves(I Live on my own) To be honest I feel like I have a good chance. So my question is should I ask her on this date or do I not know her well enough for that? If so does anyone have any advice for me when I ask her.
20090309195145AAKZIFt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	**Girls only!** What did I do wrong?  Confused?	This weekend I kicked this dude in the balls (I think?) cuz he was harassing me at a party and then grabbed my butt, but nothing happened! He just like backed up and was like "woah, baby!" I talked to a couple of my friends and some of them had similar experiences like half the time! I always thought they would just go down right away?       So, wondering if any of you girls who have kicked guys in the balls:   1) Have any special way to do it?   2) How much experience do you have kicking guys?   3) What happened each time?   4) How many times did it "work" or not "work".   Thanks for your input! :)

20090309194925AAtgRM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she just toying with my emotions, or is she telling the truth and just unsure?	ok, I recently caught up with a friend from high school, one who I had feelings, ithad been 5 years, and I still felt the feelings, but stronger! We became **** buddy's and started acting like we were in a relationship, and she's been telling me she has feelings for me and that she wants a relationship, and I feel the same (she told me her feeling's before I said mine, maybe there's more of a chance it's true?), the other day she told her aunt that I was her boyfriend, so I asked if that meant she wanted to try a relationship, and she said yes, then yesterday, after 2 days, something was wrong, she wouldn't say what, but I guessed it was her having second thoughts, I was right, it ended up her saying let's just be friends, and then I spoke to her later in the day, and she said she definately wants a relationship, and definately has feelings for me, and that she wants to go back to the **** buddy acting together thing, just so she can have time to think about it, and be sure that it's not going to turn out like her last two relationships (which were very bad, one hit her the other was overly controlling) and that she is ready for a relationship, I got it out of her that she want's a bit more of the single life aswell, which I originally wanted, but now being back around her, my feelings are stronger then I've ever felt before, and it's only been 4 week's.. I think that's all the main point's of it, but what do I do, do I let her take aslong as she want's/needs, or do I give it a couple of weeks and ask her what she's thought, I've never been in a situation like this, so I'm really unsure, and I want a relationship with her, but I dont want to let her take ages, then either lose her to someone else, or end up getting told she doesn't want a relationship.. So if anyone has any help or anything, thankyou in advance :)

20090309195724AAK2URY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't get over, it's really hard. Please help.?	Ok. So over the course of maybe a month or so me and my ex (before we were going up) built up a extreamly well friendship. I would go as far as to say she was one of my top 3 best friends at the highest point, and she had told me about the same thing. We both liked each other, but never really did anything about it, or brought it up. It got to the point where you could say we were "Dating without the title". All of our friends were waiting for us to go out, and we knew that. Mostly by my own desire to take things further, and backed by a little bit of pure pressure I asked her out. Not that I didn't want too, but if it was totally up to me I would've waited a little bit longer before I did.    She said yes, and we had been going out for about a week when we went on a trip with one of my other friends. This is why I wanted to wait before I asked her out, I wanted to see how this trip went, because we were both going.    To make it simple, the trip was really awkward for some reason. It was probably because we both felt that we were "pushed" into being in a relationship, not that we regretted it though. When we got back from the trip I was talking to her on the phone and she said the trip was really awkward and that stuff, and that she could only see us being friends and wanted to break up. She also said that since her grandma had died last November, she didn't think she could handle still dealing with a relation ship and dealing with her grandma (This breakup happened early Februrary btw)   I tried to argue a few points with her, but when she brought up her Grandma reason, I couldn't say anything, because I knew that I would be an asshole for denying her that reason. She said she wanted to go back to the Best Friend state that we had been in, and I had said that was ok.   It didn't turn out so well. It has been over a month now and we barely speak, were friends, but not nearly as good as we used to be. She stopped texting me completly, and all of that stuff we used to do while we were just best friends.    Even though we were only going out for a week, I took this extreamly hard. I still get in tears about it, I'm considering going to the counselor at my school about it, but I would feel stupid because I had already gone to her once this year about another breakup. I really don't know what to do.

When i came out my boy friend was laying on the bed naked with a condom on...but the condom was over his testicles as well. I told him that's not how it goes but he insisted it was the right way. I didn't know if he would of got hurt if we did it like that or not so i told him i didn't feel like going though with it that night. so yeah we ended up just playing xbox the rest of the night...what a downer. i want to know...next time should i just roll with it and make love to him like that or try to convince him to fix it. Please don't bash him he has slight autism. Thanks so much for your help guys.
20090309201055AAQbHnN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you answer something I've always wondered?	Well, I'm 16 and I'm straight, and the age old question I ask myself every time I'm seeing someone is "Should I tell them about my one embarrassing hobby?"       That hobby is baking and decorating pastries, my favorite of them all being decorating cakes. I can do it all, make buttercream roses, various other flowers, all the borders, fondant, gumpaste flowers. anyways, should I tell girls that I bake or is that a huge turn-off? I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks and I don't know if I should tell her! She's the artistic type, just like all the girls I fall for hehe, I'm sure she wouldn't mind. I used to make cakes all the time for my ex and she loved it, but the last girl I dated gave me a weird grimace!       Tell me what you think about a 16 year old baker. haha, peace.

My feelings for him increases and decreases over time but never fades away. I want to tell him how i feel but i am just afraid it will ruin our friendship. I told him once that i like him more than a friend, and he told me "you too?' but at that point he was with his girlfriend. He have broke up with his girlfriend more than a year already.

But we just started talking again about two months ago.We met when i was four and ive known his sister all my life but he and i never really met again after i moved from next door when i was 6. Then i met him again two years ago when he was on leave.We started talking again on myspace a few months ago and then he had me over when he was on leave for 3 weeks. It was amazing to be with him and he was the first guy to ever make me feel the way i do...He will be in Iraq until November with one 30 day leave.   Im not use to this long waiting period to wait for any boyfriend and while im willing to wait for him i definately need somebody who gets what im going through. Nobody seems to really understand what im dealing with...hes always on my mind and all i keep doing is talking about him.

She told me like that her boyfriend doesn't treat her right sometimes and he even said to her face that she's not the perfect girl for him. She seems to confides in me about stuff like this, but I just seem like a good friend to her, I think. Should I just tell her that I like her? Or just keep on being a good friend/a "nice guy"? Has anyone been in this situation?
20090309202226AAVDcbX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if he just wants sex or if he wants a relationship?	Theres this guy at work that I'd like to date but I have certain reservations about dating him. First, he may or may not be married, I just can't get a straight answer from him or anyone else. Second, he has a reputation for being slutty. Third, I know that he lies to me. Fourth, a part of me thinks he just wants to sleep with me, hit it and quit it. On the other hand a part of me thinks that he has genuine feelings for me and that makes me curious about him and makes me want to date him. I've known that he likes me for a while now but nothing has really happened between us. Is it even worth it to try? Should I just stay away? The big question is how do I know what he really wants from me? Sex or a relationship

20090309202441AA0C8t1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I date this guy or just try to move on and forget about him?	I'm seventeen and so is the guy that I'm currently interested in. This guy I like is best friends with his ex-gf. They dated for a year & a half and she is the first and only girl that he lost his virginity too. I'm really into him but he won't cut ties with this girl claiming that they are "just friends". She put recent pictures of them up together & it looked like they could be more than friends. I feel like if he decides to officially call me his girlfriend, they should not be hanging out together anymore. Because it is like he is dating two girls at once since he obviously can't get over her.      What should I do? Date him or not???      My ex-bf said that he was "just friends" with his ex too. Now that we are broken up, they are back together again. That's why this really worries me... but please, tell me what you honestly think.      Thank you.

20090309203012AA8rnS7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when your guy friend likes you?	ok so i have this guy friend, hes really awsome we have alot in common but i jus met him through another friend and well we were talking one day and he asked me to go to slipknot with him (band) and asked for my # i gave it to him and we ended up going. he seemed a lil nervous around me though.

20090309203350AAVyf5F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are girls intimidated by guys, if so, why?	Ok, I'll start by saying I am college aged.      I have a bit of a sarcastic sense of humor and am one of those 4.0gpa type students.  I don't think of myself as a nerd, but as someone who applies himself.  I say this now to let you know I am no stud muffin, lol.      At the same time, I have no problem talking to people.  Well this one girl had told me "you seemed intimidating at first."  I'd like to know what causes such a view?  Is it arrogance?  I'd prefer not to have any "kind and nice" answers.  I know if a girl is intimidating, it means she's really good looking.  I know if its a guy, it's really bad and denotes arrogance, standoffishness and it means a girl doesn't want to open up to a guy.      Well we talked for a good month or two and then stopped for a good few months.  Now I'm in the same boat with this girl, she's not really conversing with me a lot 1 on 1 but has no problem doing it when we're in groups with other people.      Is there a way I can dig myself out of this "intimidating" hole.  Lol, it's got to be personality because physically, I'm not intimidating (I'd actually like to be called it from other guys because it would mean you're macho or something).  But if a girl says it to a guy, I know for sure it's a bad thing and it suggests an attitude problem.  Is there a way to dig myself out of this hole again?  The 2 months of not talking is what got me back there.
20090309203255AAKlU7d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you girls ever get involved with a bi guy?	This is a long story but the gist of it is that I'm struggling with my attraction towards women which is much stronger than my attraction towards men. I broke up with my boyfriend who I love and respect as a person but he proposed that I stay with him and date women to see how it works out before I make it final. The thing is I just don't believe any woman would give me the time of the day considering these circumstances. Would you ever seriously date a guy who technically still has a boyfriend?

20090309204217AA9LIl8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking up with long term boyfriend...?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 5 years, however it's gotten to the point where I feel I'm more friends with him than a partner or significant other.  I don't get excited the way I used to when we were first together.  I've tried different things to make me feel differently but nothing works.  Our intimate relationship feels more like an obligation that anything else at this point.  And saying "I love you" feels forced for me.        I'm ready to move on and be single but I don't know how to tell him.  He's already talking about marriage, which makes it more difficult.  He truly is my best friend, but that's all I see him as at this point.      How do I  tell him  I'm ready to move on without losing him forever?
20090309204413AAA6nzv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unpredictable behavior?	My boyfriend and I have had a little problem over to go food the other night (I got the wrong order) and somehow a fight started. All I said was that he did not order the food I have asked him to so there was no mistake on the restaurant's part and I couldn't take it back. He got very mad, cussed at me, F word after F word and would not stop yelling. At the end he told me to work towards moving out and insulted me...   I said, OK, I would move out. After he cooled down, he started being super nice...like nothing happened! and all he wants to do is hug me...I am very confused and cannot get over his words. I do not like being in a situation where I feel so vulnerable! His temperament is simply unpredictable, we can be okay one minute and miserable the other. Have you known someone like this? Should I move out?

20090309205544AAHtuUz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I kissed HIM... Now what?	On Saturday night, I went to a party at my boyfriends house. There was only six people there. Me, 1 other girl, my boyfriend, and 3 of his friends.      We watched one of the most funniest movies in today's generation: The Simpson's Movie.      We sat on the couch next to each other; nothing could separate us (unless of coarse you were one of his friends and you jumped on him from behind).      Towards the middle of the movie, two of his friends said they would give him 5 minutes and then he had to do it. Of coarse I knew what they were talking about, but I ignored them.   They put up a pillow to hide us from them in case we would kiss.   Every stinking 5 minutes, they would yank down the pillow and one of his friends would say, "Did you do it yet???"       One of the times, his friend did it so I replied, "Hey, how do you know we haven't kissed already??!!"       He looked back and forth between me and him with a face that was a combination of confusion, laughter, and wonder. As this happened, he quickly asked, "Wow wow wow... Wait a minute... Did you???"      I looked at him, laughing at the previous sight, saying, "No!!! Ha ha! I got you their for a minute."      Once they put the pillow back up, we both knew this was our chance, but I let him make the move.      The next thing I knew, we were sitting their kissing!!!      Then, of coarse, his friends yank down the pillow...   And, in time, we stop kissing. All four of them looking at each other with that amazed look on their face...         Ok That's what happened... The first kiss is over...      Now, What do I do???      I can't stop thinking about the kiss...      I don't get to see him every day, but I talk to him every day!!!   Now, all I want to do is kiss him...   What should I do???   I know I should keep in mind that he's isn't going to want to kiss all the time. But right now I just want to hold him...      Please Help Me!!!
20090309205608AAwAsLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I in love? What is love anyway)?	Here's my situation : atheres this woman in my life. She is currently in a relationship, but we are good friends. Everytime we're together, I get butterflies in my stomach and I sometimes feel like my face is on fire. I could talk to this woman for hours and never get bored. I think about her almost 24/7. I care about her a lot. So much that I couldn't imagine us having a relationship together if it meant she would no longer be with her current boyfriend because they are madly in love and I am happy for her and couldn't bare to see her sad. But I have such strong feelings for her. And this isn't really a physical attraction. She isn't the worlds most attractive woman, but her personality is like solid gold, and we have so much in common. Because of this, everytime I spend time with her she appears more beautiful to me. What is going on here? Am I in love? Why do I have these feelings? By the way, I am 25 years old and she is 26.

20090309205838AAOO4jU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do if I'm in love with a girl from UC San Diego?	I'm currently a 1st year at UC Davis, and I think I'm doing well in school. Keeping myself busy with homework and studying, working out, and I'm planning on staying here this summer to go to school and teach kids how to swim. Family is awesome and I love them a lot. Basically, I have everything I can ever ask for, and I'm focusing on the right things.       Only thing though, is that I'm in love with my ex from high school, and I don't know how to deal with it. I think about her all the time, and I always find myself thinking about her once I wake up.       I messed up our relationship in high school by giving up when things got really bad. Since then I just dated around figuring that I'd find someone I can have a stable relationship with, but the only person I really want in the end is her. Any advice?

20090309205900AATf6nj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be insulted?	someone said they would not describe my face as pretty but would say it is cute, they went on to say it's a good thing. A pretty /hot face is more of a slutty look, while cute faces are loved by all and much better. I was a bit insulted but I was assured by this person that I shouldnt be, they'd rather be with a cute faced girl than one with a hot face... I'm still a bit bothered by it. Guys tell me what you think

20090309210306AASxf6b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems, who needs them?	I already posted this but didn't get answers - so please, answer.      Okay, I will try and make this short and in point form:      -girl meets boy, they become friends (grade 7 - young, I know, but whatever!!)    -a stupid middle school "romance" that girl cannot get over for whatever reason. (grade 8)   -Still thinking about this guy, no other guys seem to be attractive, even though the guy has definitely moved on. With girls who the girl used to be friends with....WEIRD. (grade 9)      And now I'm in grade 10 and I still cannot help liking him! We barely talk, and when we do he makes fun of me and my silly ways. I turn red almost every time I see him, and no guys pique my interest. (even though I left the middle school into high school where I assumed there would be at least ONE new guy to get my mind off this boy.)      Now I have two questions, that I am willing to hear whatever opinion you have on them:      1) Why do you think I still like this guy, who has proved time and time again that he's a jerk and not the guy for me?      2) How do I FINALLY get over this guy I've liked for 2.5 years! This is soooo pathetic, haha.      Anyways, most thorough answer is appreciated and awarded ten lovely points! Thanks =)

There's this guy (Chris) I know from church.I've known him a year,and he used to be nice to me--Say hi, sit next to me @ youth functions.Called me a few times.We're 17.    Sunday,the last spot in the parking lot was next to his truck,so I parked there.I drew a lil smiley face on his passenger side window.After church,I was on my phone in my truck when he came back to lock his truck.When he got the passenger side,he saw the face.He glanced at me,erased the smiley and sauntered away.   I went out to lunch with his family (his mom, dad, 16 year old sister and him)Chris was in the bathroom,There were 2 empty chairs next to me.His mom said, "Oh,Chris is gonna have to sit next to Ellie." In that like-all-knowing-mom tone.WHAT does that mean?But when he came back from the bathroom,he sat in the 2cnd empty chair.His mom was like, "WHY can't you sit next to her?" And he said, "Oh,I'm sick.I'll get her sick." He has allergies--Not sick.   Last night I saw him at the bowling alley,and I told him bout a truck I'm buying (it’s from 1979--it’s an abandoned vehicle).He was like, "Oh." Then,as I was walking out to my truck in the parking lot he called, "You don't need a truck!" I glared at him, "But I already have one." (I drive a Bronco) and he smiled, "EXACTLY!THAT'S WHY I SAID IT." AND then laughed and got in his truck.

20090309220946AAVDboD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever been this hard up for sex?	Man Pleads No Contest to Getting Intimate With Car Wash Vacuum        Michigan: On Wednesday, a plea of no contest was submitted by 29-year-old Jason L. Savage to the Saginaw County Circuit Court after being charged with indecent exposure in a sex act with a vacuum at a car wash in Thomas Township.      Although an agreement was made with prosecutors to drop the aggravated indecent exposure charge, he still faces jail time of up to a year. While in court, Savage admitted being on parole until June for a 2004 incident when he fled from police.      A resident said in the report that at around 6:45 a.m. Oct. 16, "someone acting suspicious" was seen at the car wash. A nearby officer caught Savage in the act after approaching him on foot.            Source: www.mlive.com      Have you?

20090309211955AACeZyQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys can you help me on this one please?	I had some strong eye contact with a guy last year in the hallway at school. He was just looking at me so I looked at him back. There was no smiling or anything between us...pretty much a stare down and then I had to look away.      I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.      We are in college
20090309210606AAkdL1H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your help.  i can't figure this out. please help me?	my mom is crazy. she always makes me feel guilty about everything and let my younger brothers and sister get away with everything. i'm the "good one " , but she gives me a hard time.  i grew up with her always telling me that  when i do things to her.. bad things happen to me. how could i possibly do anything to her being the respectful one ..?mean while the other kids get away with everything.  now i have children of my own and my daughter has a hearing loss which requires surgery to improve her hearing. my mom keeps giving me this vibe like ... yeah see, look at your child. that's what you get for being insensitive to me ! how could she ! this is her granchild. how do i handle her? please help. i'll take any advice. thanks. by the way she's 54, a single parent. i'm married with 3 kids. what is wrong with her.
20090309214043AAW89qC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay, so what's going on?	I've caught the guy I like looking at me during class and in the halls for a while now. My friends always say 'He was checking you out. He probably likes you' and I thought he did too. Over the weekend, there was a big party and this morning at school, everyone was talking about it. Someone asked him why he was flirting with some girl at the party. I didn't think of it much because I flirt with other guys, too. Then others agreed and were like 'you were with her all night. you were definately flirting with her; it was so obvious.'      Then my friend told me she talked to him about me. I asked what she said and she just asked him if he knew who I was. It took him a little over 10 minutes to finally respond 'oh, that one chick in one of my classes. she has those red shoes?'      Part of me feels incredibly stupid for thinking he might actually like me when he only knows me as the 'girl with red shoes'. The other part of me can't help but feel hopeful that he still might possibly like me; that he was just playing around when he took forever to remember who I was. But I know that's highly unlikely.      What do you think? Is it possible that he might like me? I make it pretty obvious I like him; always staring at him during class. Is he completely oblivious, or just not interested? Ugh, I'm so confused.
20090309222054AAjwbID	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are there hot girls on dating websites?	most of them are ugly but there are some that are hott. i haven't actually met someone off a dating website but yeah. i wanted to c how those girls look.   i would think hot girls get approached by guys all the time so why dot hey need a dating website. i noticed some of the hot girls are mothers but ther eare some that are not mothers.
20090309223658AAEBuZH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think are his expectations of me?	Three months ago I met this really nice boy online. I'm 19 and he is 21.  He is in the Navy and is currently deployed and will be back in July.  We really click, at least emailing each other. The other day he sent me this cute email and asked me if I would have dinner with him when he got back :) (that is in 4 months).  Do you think he expects me not to date anyone until then?  I mean, if our communication keeps up I don't think I would want to date anyone else, but I just wondered.
20090309214342AAr1vN4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding photographer....sketchy?	I should have know everything could work perfectly right?  lol      I found a wedding photographer, that was affordable (very affordable), and actually had very lovely pictures.  (Unlike some I'd seen...who expected me to pay $300-500 for pictures my 6 year old could have taken)       I was supposed to meet with her,  but she never answered her phone.  I left a few messages.   We had agreed to meet Friday, and if that wasn't possible we would meet Saturday instead.  Both days, I called and left a message but she never returned my call.  No e-mail...nothing.      Should I just move on and try to find another photographer and if she contacts me just tell her I'm not interested anymore?        Call again (I'm starting to feel like a stalker lol)?        Or look at other photographers as maybe a backup encase she flakes out again?

20090309233058AA8uEzv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it so difficult to speak to and meet black women?	Seems like EVERYONE i try to meet has like this chip in their shoulders or bitter about something or just have negative attitudes.. I'm sure very race from Hispanic, Whites and Asian have a few but its nothing like black women.. I would say 8 out of 10 are just awful.. Maybe this is one reason why black men go for other type of women because black women are running them away with this kind of attitude.. What do you guys think?? I'm a black man and i get more love from Asians, Whites and Hispanic women, go out on dates, movies etc but cant get no love from my own people, maybe its because I'm not a thug or look like lil wayne, 50cents and other thugs with their pants half off their asses which black women find sexxxxxxy, that's why black women do this dumb **** is to impress black women and they love this crap that's why we have soooo many knucklehead black men doing dumb ****, black women find this attractive and they will show off and do something dumb and instead get their asses locked up in jail or been to prison a billion times,(Which black women find attractive by the way, to them this shows they are a REAL MAN!!) If black women would up their standards and not like the dumb-*** thugs then they wouldn't be doing what they are doing but black women love it so they will just be stuck having single black-mothers and still hearing them complain after saying, Oh there are no good black men where are the good black men??? what a shame?

I'm trying to get over this guy that I had a lot of history with and I'm just tired of things between us. I wanted to be friends with him but I regrettably had sex with him this past weekend and I came to the realization that we can't be friends and that we're probably always going to have that sexual tension, and I don't want him to hurt me again. So just in case he calls, should I answer?? For sure I'm not calling him!! What about if we see each other at school (college).
20090309213512AA59mYj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it too late for me?	To fix my life?       things that are currently screwed,   1) I've cheated on my b/f he doesnt know   2) I'm pretty sure I'm in love with my best (female) friend   3) I have NO Motivation or self control   4) I don't know what I want from life   5) I feel like I'm at a crossroads      Just random facts,      I'm overweight and can never stick to a diet   I'm at uni and don't do any work til the last minute and somehow scrap by   I work full time (i do uni externally on top)   I own a house with the b/f   I have like 2 close friends, the best friend from earlier, and another female friend, one lives nearish to me the other lives forever away   I have one closeish male friend that I actually get to see unlike my other friends, but I'm so worried that it'll turn out the same way any other friendship I have with a male does that I'm keeping him at arms length, and switch between misinterpreting things to seeing how far i can push him with comments i should make to him. (whenever I call a guy a best friend I end up sleeping with them or they end up liking me or something along those lines and it all goes to ****)   I dont know if i still want to be in a relationship with my boyfriend, i love him and i love what we have but I feel like im missing something. It feels like we're best friends that happen to own a house together.   I want to be young and have fun (I'm 21) but at the same time I want to be settled and secure and have the life i always dreamed of, the husband, two kids and house out bush...   Oh and I currently have a guy I talk to online who i would have classed as a friend (not a close friend but a friend) who wants to have a threesome with my friend and i... and i started to organise it and im so glad she couldn't get time off looking back on it now. But at the time i was soo keen and soo interested...      what the hell is happening? when my boyfriend and i bought this house i thought my life was finally working out and that everything would be perfect :'(
20090309215635AA1xaLD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm so confused. My feelings are hurt and Im afraid to talk about it. What can I do?	So things started out great. He was so sweet and considerate. And i just feel hard for him. I never told him cause i was scared to. Well i had a 300 dollar bill come up that HAD to be paid and i was 275 dollars short for my rent.        I asked him to lend me 275 dollars so i could pay my rent and that i would pay him back as soon as possible. He said yes. He said "I got you." And then he didnt return any of my calls or emails after that. I was so hurt that i started crying at work. The ladies at work pooled 300 together for me so i could pay it and get some food.       Im 21 and in college. My hours were cut back drastically. From 30 to 14 hours and I cant even FIND a second job. I've been looking high and low but so many ppl are unemployed right now jobs are hard to come by.       Anyways he finally wrote me and asked if he did anything to me. I was so scared to say that he left me hanging,I was upset and that i coulda ended up on the street with NOWHERE to go....but i didnt. He told me that he hadnt heard from me in 4 days and it wasnt nice.       I hope it was a mistake. He knows my situation. I dont have any family. My father is dead and my mother is on drugs so i moved here to go to college and make something of myself. I'm a junior now and i am under alot of stress already. I really thought he might be "the one" from the time i saw him, i felt it but i guess i was wrong and...i feel terrible.       What do i do?
20090309233402AAMSy94	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What am I to do? I have a crush on this girl...?	I travelled south for a week with 15 other kids to the Region V basketball tournament in Ketchikan, AK. I spent a week there, and for the majority of the time, I was with a girl whom I'd met about a month or so ago. Over the course of that week, I had come to realize that I had developed an attraction towards her; however, her boyfriend is one of my friends. I can't stop thinking bout her! What am I to do?
20090309222448AA934S9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is testing my GF to see if she really loves me...?	.... low-down? I broke up with her awhile back because she was nuts about half the time we were together. Then she got some meds from her woman doctor that make her totally passive, never gets mad and falls asleep at 9 every night. Tonight I took the toilet seat completely off and told her I was tired of putting that dang thing up and down -- nothing. Last night I told her that dinner tasted like sewage -- nothing but smiles. This morning I instructed her to go find a part-time job (she already works full time at the truck stop) -- she said OK. Can this be for real or is she going to snap one night and hack me up with a machete?

Basically i found out he was on some sites like true.com and a bunch of other ones where u meet women or men.We have been together over 2 years.We are also expecting a child.Im a nosey gf,thanks to him and his ex.In the past they would be lovey behind my back.So i have had trust issues.One day i tried his ex's name as his password and it worked.I came to find out that most of the emails he reads is emails from these sites.Saying new messages or meet new girls in your area.We are a very happy and loving couple.He is extremly attached to me.So i was wondering why would he be reading these emails?Makes me feel that hes interested in meeting others.I have asked him and he said he made the accounts years ago.before we met.So any ideas?
20090309231002AAcVsta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys is this flattering or not?	Guess you can call me the "good girl" - no matter how bada$$ i joke around and try to be, i'm just those laid back girls that can get along and be one of the guys yet still classy lady who respects herself. I'm friendly, approachable. I'm in my early 20's and yet I get along way better w. older people (Yes, I know I'm a weirdo - one of my closest friends is 27). I think girls my age (and in general) are way too dramatic, jump to conclusions, are super judgemental and so narrow-minded...and i really try and stay away from that. I'm a picky girl yet I wouldn't mind being friends w. guy - they just need to respect me and I'm not one to like being hit on...I'm not an easy girl.       ANYWAY (sorry - no self promotion, i promise!) this guy I was talking to called me a "heartbreaker". I'm not mean, I just don't say "yes" to every guy who wants to "hang out". I was at a clib w. him and 2 of his friends (who weren't even aware we were "talking" at that point), were asking him about me and said I was the "prettiest one" out of all the girls he's encountered...they were hittin on me RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM (which i think would be rude on their part as hommies...oh boys) and I just stood there uncomfortable signaling for that guy to help me haha Later on, he kept tellin me how I was a "heartbreaker" but I turn down guys on the spot. HEY, at least I'm being honest and straightfoward and I don't lead guys on. There      sooo is this a "compliment" in guy world?
20090309213113AAQX3ws	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Calling it quits or overreacting?	After finding out my fiance lied to me, I told him I needed some space.  He asked me to marry him - and 5 months later told me he was married more than once!   He broke my trust.   During this separation I found qualities I like about him, but can't seem to get over the trust issue and now finding out he owes 6K from his last wife on medical bills....he divorced her 8 years ago!!!  That should have been paid off (if he made any payments).   He sends me txts and emails daily saying he loves me and wants us to be happy forever.   He said he will get a job and will pay the bills and everything will be fine.    I think he is dreaming.   he lost his job, he is obviously behind on bills and didn't tell me he was married more than once!  I gave his ring back and now I want to tell him I don't think I am in love with him anymore.  I think I would rather be alone than with someone I don't trust or can't trust.   Any ideas of what to say?    Or do you think I am over reacting?
20090309222646AAtLnXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like this guy won't accept me because i cut myself.?	there's this guy, and things are getting kinda serious. we've never hooked up before, but I think I want to soon. he knows I cut myself, I just don't think he knows how seriously sick in my head I am, and how much I cut. my legs and torso are covered in cuts and scars and bruises. and the stuff that goes on inside my head is ridiculous even to me. I'm such a freak, I don't know how anyone could be able to accept me for who I really am. should I break things off before they get too serious to avoid any heartache, or do you think I should just confess everything to him?

20090309220758AAjfVGj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A Question for women?	Do you think I have so many trust issues because my mum tried to kill me before I was born? Or maybe it's because I got my finger chopped off in a red wagon toy? Or could it be because of the time my family and friends abandoned me in a psych ward for over a month? Or is it all just genetic? On the other hand, it could be the head trauma when that cop tried to beat me to death with a baseball bat..? Or maybe it's "the thing" growing on my brain? *muses*      .. So much fear and anger. This is why I will never find Mrs. Right and raise a family together. .. Oh well.
20090309210859AAKnjjO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy at school like me?	There is this guy who is in one of my classes. I have liked him since September. I sat close to him for a while and we would get our notebooks for each other. Then I had my friend tell him I liked him but he said that he just wanted to be friends for now. (I didn't know he had a girl friend at the time.) We stopped talking for a month or two because he sat across the room from me. Then one day out of the blue he came and sat right next to me. I was delighted. We started talking all period long. He compliments me and sometimes he gets me my notebook and stuff without me asking him to. I want things to move faster and I think he likes me too. What can I do to kick up the speed (I'm not good at confrontation)? Do you think he even likes me? Please just give me the truth no matter how brutal.

20090309222802AAFJ3zR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I start talking to this girl and explain my feelings for her without freaking her out?	Okay well there's this girl (that supposedly likes me according 2 my friend) at my high school. I'm really into her and all the only thing is I don't really talk with her. We only pass when changing classes or in our period 2 (Honors Bio) so we don't c much of each other. My friends told me that I should go after her and just start talking. Today they said "Go up 2 her and tell her u like her." I was 2 afraid 2 cuz it might have freaked her out, she's kinda shy trust me very shy. What should I do? Should I just skip the friend part becuz it's been very hard for the both of us 2 talk 2 each other and become friends without getting nervous and knowing that we have more than friend feelings 4 each other. Also can u give examples of what I should do?

20090309220116AATc4V9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I really MISS feeling Desired sexually, AM I WRONG?	My husband and I have been married 20 years. We don't look our age. We get told this all the time. Anyway I happened to find out that my husband would have dreams about having sex with my friends and even a threesome with my sister and I. That he would even carry these thoughts with him to the restroom and jack off. He'd be dreaming of having many of my friends sexually including some women he'd see during the day. He would use the excuse that his dreaming sexually would start with me and end with me. So he felt like it wasn't wrong.      Seems to me that he must be thinking of women in a sexual way pretty regularly. I have a VERY VERY LOW-SELF ESTEEM now that I found this out. I struggle to go any where with him. Always wondering whose he eyeing next sexually. He has mad me feel so unattractive. We were out the other night for our 20th wedding anniversary and we were walking downtown in the city when we passed a bunch of guys. They all seen me and took a double take and it made me feel so good. I have guys hit on me pretty regularly,  I have had men say I'm HOT,  Seems I am more Thankful when a stranger tell me I look good than my husband anymore. After all he can't seem to get a Bunch of my friends and other women out of his mind sexually. So BLUNTLY I don't FEEL good around him anymore, Not sure why actually, I guess the hurts to painful.      I really MISS feeling like "I'm" he's Desires sexually, I don't want him Wanting my FRIENDS sexually AM I WRONG? DO all Men treat there wife's like this???
20090309213552AACIJCi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some women act so crazy and stupid?	Ok so a couple of weeks ago I wrote my ex a letter expressing how I felt about things. The next day she replied to mine with one of her own. It took me a few days to figure out what to say to her after her letter so I wrote that I needed time to figure stuff out and until then we can be friends. So the other day she came around and told me how she loves being free and not having anyone to worry about and that she can bang whoever she wants and blah blah. So for a moment I slipped up and told her she couldn't but as soon as the words came out I knew I had just stepped on a landmine. So she says "um no I'm FREE and I can do whoever I want remember caz you made your lil choice" So I told her "well it looks like I made the right choice so can you leave now" Like wtf was her problem? What should I do?

20090309212325AAda1mu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is is appropriate to sleep over at his place this early?	I've been dating a guy for about 3 weeks. I'm 20, he's 22. We met through a common extra-curricular: running, and he lives downtown near our university while I live in the suburbs.      I often drive to town. He invited me to go to his friends party on Saturday. Obviously I will drink (saint-patricks!), so I won't be driving... I could always take public transport back to my house late at night (it would take over an hour) But I'd also have to be back downtown early the next day for work... so... If he offers to me to stay at his place (which I think he will), should I accept?      It's very expensive to take a cab because it's a 30 min drive      I really wouldn't have sex with him, nor would I sleep in the same bed with him! But just for convenience sake since we will be drinking, I wont be able to drive, and I also work the next day practically right near where he lives!      Is this a good idea? Or should I really make my way home that night?      What do you suggest I do?

20090309230623AAQoRsa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should a man hit a woman even if she deserved it?

20090309212429AAKnTh2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do???  I'm in a bit of a crazy situation...?	Ok I really like this girl, like REALLY like...  She's incredible.      I've been talking to her recently and it seems like she likes me...  she's called me a good guy, "sweet" on a number of occasions and she's told me that I'm "the best!" and the signs she gives off when we talk could suggest that she likes me...      She however, just told me that she got back with her ex...  I think he's a jerk and he's done some disrespectful things to her in the past which she is aware of but I don't think fully aware, and I'm in the process of letting her know of what's been happening...  I don't know why she'd want to give him another chance but whatever...  She is aware that I know of these things tho and has asked me to tell her.      Now the tricky part, I want to be with her so badly and I don't want to be considered too much of a friend for telling her all this...  Or too much of a wuss, sucking up to her or anything...  It's just that I feel that she needs to know about her ex before she dives into another thing with him...  I'm worried that telling her may ruin my chances to be with her if all goes well and if, say, she likes me back.  She is literally the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, inside and out, and I'm totally falling for her especially in the past month or so...  She doesn't know this yet I don't think...      Either way, its already to the point where I have to tell her...  Did I get myself into something I shouldn't have, or if all goes well, do I still have a chance with her???      Thanks!

He said he still does have feelings for me and that he i happy that I am in his life because I'm exactly like him.

20090309215001AAv943f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do you think it is appropriate to have sex?	I don't really want to hear answers like wait until marriage, or until you and your partner are sexually mature.  All I really want is a poll of ages in which you believe it is appropriate for someone to have sex.  If you had to pick an age, what would it be?

20090309210642AALDQ7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where to meet good guys?	Most of my friends are in relationships, yet they are not with good guys.  The guys either treat them poorly and don't value them, or they don't have any ambition, or they are selfish or unintelligent, and usually they are all of those things.  Wherever I go, those are the only types of men I can find.  There are some really great guys at my university, but most of them are taken.  Why is it that all of the men at home are losers?  And where would I eventually meet a good guy?

20090309223358AApDyXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I asked him if he wanted to break up... and?	My boyfriend and i were fighting over why he's been so distant and focuses more on his friends now. He hasnt been sacrificing not even 30 minutes of his time to talk to me during the day, and we only get to see each other once a week. Were both in our late teens, and he doesnt work. So, he's definately not tired from work or busy with that bcus hes always playing games with his time. But, when we were fighting, he just kind of.. gave up and started saying how he didnt deserve me, how hes such a bad boyfriend, saying that i should dump him & all of that junk. Sp, i simply asked him if he wanted to break up, but he hung up right when i asked. So what is that suppose to mean?

20090309222522AAVw6n0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the matter with me? You'd think a guy would learn.?	So, here I am, a guy of seventeen years old, I've only had one girlfriend my whole life, who I went out with for two months, and who dumped me about a year ago. I'm left with a broken heart, and the realization that that's two months I will never get back. Then, what do I do? I go around, hoping that some girl will have it in their heart to give me a chance. Now, in looking for love, I've found one girl who I've got a good feeling about, cute, friendly, and another girl who is sweet, and as a bonus, is a total fox. But I get this feeling in the back of my mind that no matter how hard I try, there's a strong possibility that I might not get either girl. I really want a relationship. I deserve to be loved. I am told all the time that I'm attractive, and sweet, but if that's the case, wouldn't more people accept date offers from me? I really want a loving, caring, happy relationship with a girl, but I don't know how much longer I can hold on. Should I even bother anymore?

Should I just act non-nonchalant?       One detail that may be of importance is that we only see each other once a week...so our relationship is highly dependent on phone conversations.

My boyfriend became friends with him over the weekend and is now stuck up his *** like crazy. It scares me so bad because now my boyfriends going to parties and he's just not that kind of guy. I don't mean to sound selfish but it's like we barley see each other during the week so the weekend is usually our thing. Now i dont know what to do, he's already changing on me, and thats the only person he talks about anymore.      He swears up and down that he's not going to change but I've known this kid for 4 years and he pressures anyone into anything and doesnt take no for an answer. I'm not even happy with him going to this party because the girl that's throwing it, he knows I can't stand her but he thinks its okay because he's going with my friend. I'm very upset about this and I just think he's going to change into him and end up cheating on me, getting drunk, and smoking every single weekend. I just don't want to loose him.       Can someone please help me. Btw; i'm 15 years old.

Well, this girl asked me for the sadies hawkins dance at our school. She seemed really happy when i accepted. She once liked me and i did too but we came to a conclusion that it would be better if we just remained as friends. Well, the other day my friends at the hospital voulunteer with her and have heard that she is still very much into me. But then again yesterday, my friend told me that she had second thoughts about her being with me at the dance. She said that i might just talk to her rather than dancing. I really know how to dance and i still like her very much. Also, she said i was a sweet guy and that i was a guy that is really hard to find. I just need to know what to do. Should i go, or should i just make a lame excuse and skipp it. I have already bought my ticket and i tried so very hard to buy hers but the school wanted her present with her id. She also said she will buy her own, but she felt flattered when i said i tried this. I still like her.

20090309230800AAqJfuZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This quiet girl is hard to read but i think she rejected me. should i text her tonight?	i've been going to my college's library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, because i like the girl who works there, since shes nice and good-looking. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing, compared to the others who work there   so last monday, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name.   last tues, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, hesitated, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about the upcoming weekend (which was this past weekend)? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town. i then asked about any time that week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop      finals are in a week from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up this week for coffee even if she agrees, since shes was busy last weekend, and last week, if shes was honest. maybe we can meet up 3 weeks from now, in the new semester?      i just called her tonight (its currently 11pn in my timezone) but she didnt answer. its been an hour now, and still no response      should i text her? or is it obvious she rejected me?

20090309215431AAg4juJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl still like me? ladies help me!?	so i met this girl at work and asked her out on a date and we had an amazing time together and recently i had decided to give up on her because we just didnt see each other that much since she only worked with me every other weekend. and whenever i would text her we would text and once i asked her if she wanted to hangout, she would stop texting and never reply back. this last weekend we worked together and we both took our breaks together and i must say it went well. after work i texted her the whole night and the conversation never died. so basically after this i have once again fallen for her and have decided to go after her again. but i wanna know if its a good idea that i do this. does it seem like she still likes me?

20090309220319AAvZ1Ag	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Seriously girls are confusing, what did I do to make her hate me?	Okay long story short, I was good friends with this girl a couple of years ago. I told her my feelings and she ignored me and over the past 2 years she either ignore me or became friends with me as it kept going back and forth. I still like her.      Okay now a couple of weeks ago she decided to talk to me again for the first time in like 4 months. She told me she didn't hate me anymore and so we had a nice conversation. She knows that I liker her as her friend asked me that earlier.The next day we also had a great conversation, said she didn't like me and don't want me to get the wrong idea and then added her on facebook later on. She didn't accept my invitation nor did she ignore it but she just didn't do anything to it as she did some other things on her facebook.      So I don't get to see her until Monday as it was Friday since we talked and the rest of the week I didn't really get to talk to her. On Monday I said hi to her and then on Friday I talked to her briefly on how she didn't talk to me the whole week, she just said that's unfortunate and din't really bothered. Then today I tried talking to her but she just ignored me and walked as fast as she can away from me. Later during the day I noticed she blocked me from facebook.      I honestly have no idea what I did wrong. I didn't really say much to her and nothing I said was really insulting to her as we had good friendly conversations with each other. She's really confusing as she said she didn't hate me a couple weeks ago and now she hates me even though I only said like no more than 20 words to her between that time.      BTW:During the week when I couldn't talk to her, I didn't have a lot of chances to talk with her so I only talked to her once that week and said hi to her that's it

Yo, I have never cheated on my wife of 8 years, but I keep seeing cuties all over the place because I'm at college and I would never flirt or anything, but i just keep wondering about things like...   what their Uccys smell like and how good it would feel if they gave me head, and do they think I'm cute.

20090309234224AADedJ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I act this way?	I have a problem with emotions. Like I'm very emotionally detached. I'm like incapable of loving someone. I care about my friends and i care a little too much about people I don't know but whenever a guy I like likes me back I don't like him anymore. It's like once the chase is over, I'm bored and I don't care. And its really starting to get annoying because i can't help it and i feel bad for leading them on, but i don't mean too. i think i like them and then i guess i don't.    i don't know if its just that i haven't found anyone that i actually care about at all or if its my age. (I'm 17) and I'm just not ready to care about anyone yet.    i don't know. just something that's bothered me for awhile. haha. been wondering about it because it doesn't seem like any of my friends have this problem.      I've never asked a question like this before so this will be interesting. haha.   feel free to say dumb things.  ; )
20090309213211AA97vLH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask her out again?	I've known this girl for almost a month now and we talk almost every day after class on our way back to our dorms. We have gotten together a couple times outside of class for studying and lunch.      So I decided to ask her out on a date the other day and at first she seemed really taken aback but said yes. When I asked if she was sure she said she "kind of have someone" and that its really "weird/awkward" between them. When I asked her to clarify she just went on about how her life was really complicated and even she wasn't sure whats going on. Long story short I got the "not right now" response.      I dropped it and moved on and we continued to talk everyday as if I hadn't asked her out.      Lately she seems a bit different, she laughs at just random things I say and give me detailed plans for her weekends. Also when I texted her about homework she would reply every time with "lol" at the end even though it wasn't something funny....but after a few back and forth she would stop replying....      Shes the really shy and innocent type so its been really hard for me to decipher what her feelings are.      Anyways, sorry for the wall of text but I'm really confused as to whether to ask her out again or just move on.
20090309230106AA7Y1iP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Drama - my roommate's girlfriend?	OK, so I know this is going to be long…sorry.      Well, the situation is that I’m friends with a guy and a girl.  They’ve been dating for more than 3 1/2 years.  We’re all seniors in college.  He’s my roommate – has been since we were sophomores.      Last week, I got to talking with the girl a lot.  Like for hours a day.  One night we talked for like 8 hours straight.  We were flirting (we have been on and off for months now) and talking about the past, and all of her relationships, and stuff.  And then we flirt some more, and she asks how long I’ve liked her for.  And I make the mistake of actually telling her – since our first semester, but by the time I really got to know her, she was already dating my (current) roommate, so I never acted on it.  And then we flirt some more, and then she starts saying about how she’s not happy in her relationship.  She said she’s basically been looking for an excuse to dump him for a while now.  They have no interest in getting married, and plan on not being together after college (May).      And then we talk about her past some more, and her relationship history, and then we go back to flirting.  And then she decides to send me naked pictures of herself.  And all the time, she says that the two of us might be able to end up doing some things together if she were single, but she’s still officially dating my roommate, so nothing can happen now.  But she says since she doesn’t see herself staying in her current relationship after graduation, she might as well break up and be single until then (an experience she apparently feels bad about never really having at college).      So I saw her last night, and she was with her boyfriend (my roommate) so I didn’t really get to talk to her much.  But we chatted a bit about what the boundaries would be between us while she’s still dating my roommate.  Then she says that maybe if she was a bit drunk, she wouldn’t care so much about those lines, and the two of us could end up having some fun.      So we had dinner together today, and we were supposed to go back to her place afterwards (we had talked about maybe taking some more pictures or something).  So when we met up, I put a bag in her car.  It had 2 bottles of liquor, and a change of clothes.  We didn’t really talk about anything special at dinner, but when she asked me what was in the bag, I told her I had packed some alcohol, if we wanted to have fun later.      But after dinner, instead of going to her place, we came back to my place, and she ended up screwing my roommate instead of breaking up with him.  Then she had him bring up my bag for me when she left.  They looked inside, and saw the change of clothes.      I said I just used the clothes to keep the bottles from rubbing up against each other (which was partially true).  Anyway, when she got back to her place, I asked if I had done something to upset her.  And she said that she didn’t like that she thought I was trying to get her drunk, and how even if she was single, it wouldn’t mean that the two of us would ever even do anything together.  I told her how I never expected that we would automatically end up messing around just because she broke up.      She said how in past situations like this, other guys have taken advantage of her, and she didn’t want that to happen again.  Then she said she was paranoid about things, but it was OK, because the two of us were on the same page now.      The thing is, is that I would like to get with her for the little time we have left before graduation.  But she just keeps putting off breaking up with him.  And even if she did, with what she said today, she’d just think I’m a dick if I tried anything.  And even though she has STRONGLY implied that she would like me to initiate something with her, and that alcohol could help that quite a lot, now she’s saying that she might not even want to do anything with me anyway.      What gives?  What should I do now?  I don’t want her to end up mad with me, and would hate to hurt our friendship, but I also don’t want to let her go, either.  I had sort of gotten used to the idea that we could be together in a limited way until she gets around to dumping my roommate, and maybe more seriously after that, but I don’t even know if that’s even possible anymore.      And don’t give me crap about how I’m being disloyal to my roommate or whatever.  I’ve always respected their relationship, but now that it’s pretty much over, I don’t feel bad at all about what I’m doing – except to the extent that I don’t want to hurt her, and would like to make things as easy as possible on her.  So how do I get her to trust me and feel better about possibly having a bit of fun together again?      Thanks.

20090309234049AABnGvr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I get my bestfriend back?	Well it all started when I was fighting with my friend Susie. Susie's bestfriend is Donna. Susie got angry because I wrote Daniel (my bestfriend) & Donna bestfriends on my nickname. I put an angry face on my msn name, and then Daniel asked me whats wrong so I told him.      Me: Susies getting so angry, because she knows that I had a fight with Grace (another girl) because she was trying to take Daniel away, but back then I was too overprotective and I admit it, but I still hate Grace.      Daniel: Don't bag Grace she's my football buddy      Me: Sorry but she is extremly gay :-) And I will hit her if she says anything about my brother again      Daniel: *shocked face* Oh no you wont, she plays football :D      Me: So what? Haha nevermind you can go on her side *thumbs up*      Daniel: I'm not on anyones side I just hate being included in things you get yourself into.      Me: I was joking lol, I'm not including you in anything like that dont worry.      Daniel: good!      *logs off*      2 minutes later, it says 'life sucks' on Daniel's nickname.      Me: Hey, whats up?      Daniel: Nothing, life sucks.      Me: Why?      Daniel: It just does.      Me: If somethings wrong, you can tell me, you know you can talk to me about this stuff? Whats wrong man?      Daniel: Nothing! Look for yourself!      Me: What did I do!      *Daniel loggs off*      2 minutes later      Daniel: I'm sorry I love you.      Me the idiot, being busy at the time, only said ok :-)      Daniel: I just wanna be bestfriends with you, are you still upset at me?      Me: nope      --------------------------------------...   And until then we have been angry at eachother and we both have gotten new bestfriends. I have told my 'new best friend' that I don't feel that we should be best friends because I still want my old one back. And my new bestfriend understands. Well as for Daniel's bestfriend, Daniel actually LIKES her. How can I get him back?   .. i know its a long paragraph or two, but this is really important to me.
20090309211838AAe3Dva	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To all. esp.MARRIED MEN. do you really think of having sex with another woman? aside from your wife?	Do you really guys think of having sex with another girl even you are married? If yes? why? is your wife not good enough for you? Is your love not that strong for your wife to not think like that?      If a girl that is really pretty came to you and wants to have sex with you? would you do it? even your wife wouldnt find out about it?      I am just curious. My husband have a very strong sex drive, and im trying so hard to understand it. But him mentioning that he wishes he can still sleep with another girl, hurts me the most. And he said he is just being open, but wouldnt do it even girls are chasing him. But if I will allow him then he will definitely do it. and he said its not just him, its all guys who think that way. and if he is right, then why do guys have perverted mind(sorry for the term,but cant think of the best word for that)?       what would you feel if your wife think and wishes to sleep with another men? dont you think thats dirty?

20090309225143AAIFrN1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do? Should I tell my best friend?	Ok, so last year I had this boyfriend. It lasted three months. He was cute, loving, funny, and caring. Perfect. Before we were gong out, about two months before, on Myspace he talked about me with this girl he used to like. They talked about how weird I was and how I was seemingly trying to get closer to him and do these crazy things and how I was a loser (the girl said this and that I was weird). Then he got so angry because he was stupid enough to do it on Myspace and everybody saw it, and they jumped to the conclusion that all he was trying to do was hurt me. He punched a hole in a wall in a public place. After that I was scared, but things got better, and he hypnotized me again. Two months later he asked me out. It started out innocent enough, but then towards the end I left for a competition, and when I came back, his cousin told me he liked Jamie (names have been changed) again. The following week I had to leave for another competition, and when I left everybody had been angry at him for being such an indecisive dick. When I came back (only a week later), everybody was friends with him again.          After we broke up I found out he'd cheated on me several times, that he had just wanted me for sex, and to get over Jamie. During our relationship he talked about how pretty my friends were and we got into a fight where we both cussed at each other for about half an hour and then he degraded me. Then a few weeks after we broke up he faked an overdose while we were IMing each other. I threatened to call an ambulance, although I had a feeling he was faking it, and I never spoke to him again. It was the worst way to have a first boyfriend.       Now, he's started going out with my best friend. She is gorgeous and tall and very kind and innocent, and he's going to ruin her. It's been a year since we broke up, and they've already been going out for four months. He jokes about her losing her virginity to him, and has talked to her cousin about how hot I am. I admit, I have changed and I have a whole different appearance now than when we broke up, but that's no reason to disrespect your girlfriend like that. He's already gotten her in public places, pressed himself against her and made her fall back on a couch, where he gets on top of her. She tells him to get off, but he doesn't listen, until her tone gets very serious.       Now, this is my question. I've known this girl for forever, and I don't want a girl as gorgeous as her or as important to me as her to get hurt like I did, and much less by the same guy. Whenever I am in the "possible relationship" zone I back out, because I'm afraid that the same thing will happen, since I was taken advantage of for over a year of my life (we liked each other for that long). I know he wants sex out of her, and I hope she isn't blinded enough to actually lose her virginity to him. So what do you think? Should I tell her to break up with this guy no questions asked because he's already doing to her what he did to me? Should I explain to her exactly what's going on so she knows what she's getting into? Should I not even tell her at all? (because she might think I want him back, even though I wouldn't ever want him back).       Please tell me what to do. I don't want her to be afraid to start another relationship again. I don't want her to end up like me. Thanks.
20090309221034AAjqHjS	Family & Relationships;Friends	GIRLS!!  Are These Signs That a Girl Likes a Guy?	(We're both sophomores in college and she lives two floors below me. We've been friends since the first week of college but lately we've gotten very close)   1. She comes up to see me all the time, even when she's drunk   2. She talks to me about a lot of things, including deep things   3. She ALWAYS sits on my bed (not really anywhere else to sit) but she also always lays on my bed and uses my blankets   4. She made a sign and put it over my bed that said it was her territory   5. She came over drunk one night and sat next to me on my roommates bed. She sat VERY close to me and our bodies were touching. I felt some sort of tension(She is NOT A **** AT ALL. Shes got a lot of good morals and values)   6. She always comes to me when she needs someone to talk to         By the way she already has a boyfriend. Does that change your answer at all?? I'm starting to fall for her and I'm just curious if you girls thought that these would mean a girl was interested. I didn't say that she had a boyfriend first because I didn't want you to be biased. But whats your answer for before and after you found that out?

20090309222627AATPbHV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Anyone Have Any Dating Advice?	Hello there, I have been seeing this girl for a few weeks and have some general questions.      1)We have alot in common, but we cannot seem to keep a good conversation going, the only time we can is when others are around to "boost" our conversation. Is there a good way to keep a conversation going without saying "So, what's up?" or asking random off the wall questions?      2)I have taken this girl to 5 dates and am not sure when  I should kiss her. Every time I either work up the nerve or know that she is ready to, something inconvenient happens, such as a phone going off, or family running into us. How can I give her a nice little "I love you" peck at any moment?      3) We have gone on 5 dates in 3 weeks, and here today when I go to ask her out to dinner, she tells me "We don't have to always go on dates, we can....you know hang out and chill." Now does anyone know what this means? She seems to be happy and I know she doesn't want to break up, so....yeah.      Any help on these questions will be greatly appreciated.

20090309215955AAwe7qy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How did I score a guy who's out of my league?	I am not sure how this happened, but I met this guy I worked with (my job is an independent contractor where each job is different and can go from 1 day up to around 20 days or more). When I first saw him, I thought he was SO HOT, but of course he never talked to me so I never talked to him. This went on for the 21 days we worked together...at first I thought he was shy but I saw him talking to everyone else, so I figured he must hate me. Then around the last 3 days for some reason he all of a sudden wouldn't stop talking to me and now he's my boyfriend. He's out of my league...so why the change? I would try asking but I am embarrassed to. Any ideas? Thanks!

20090309220809AATdpTQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	20 or older advice please possibly from men!?	I'm asking this because I am 20 and have been through my share of horrible men.  I have a friend that I have to call a friend because he so has it in his head he does not want to be in a relationship. Hes married but separated and has a child. was i guess married for the childs sake of future benefits for the child. we have been friends for about 8 months now. we have been active but not everytime we see eachother. he does call me over to hang out when he wants to go out and come watch movies with him. we have been on and off friends because i have seemed "impatient" with him and once hes gone back to his soon to be ex wife but not as in a relationship with her. because i openly just wanted to be with him. and my dumba** has quit talking to him to try to pursue other guys b/c im getting he doesnt want to be with me. he has once before told me if he did want to be in a relationship i would be his pick. Now hes saying that he doesnt look for love or care about it and im the opposite. IDK if hes testing to see if i can be a faithful girl which i can be. or if id be good in a relationship which no one knows till they try it and see how they work out. or if hes plain and simple just not wanting to be with me. but when hes drunk hes very vulnerable (we both are) and its usually when we hook up. but ive never seen a grown man look at me and giggle the way he does when i look at him and smile or play around with him (but when hes drunk). ive recently told him i love him and have been trying to not be the one calling him all the time and tryin to hang out. i saw him today and that was to give him a ride somewhere :-/. wat do i do?

I then went out and met this really awesome guy *dan and made-out. Zack found out but didn't break-up with me. I like this other guy *Dan way better. He just lives a little further. *Dan didn't know that I had a boyfriend. Before all of this I really liked this one guy *Lance. Lance happens to be Dan's brother. And now Lance got very angry at me for making out with Dan since I had a boyfriend. Now I think Dan doesn't like me that much. I was going to break-up with Zack for Dan. But now I just look like a snank. I really want Lance, even though he's being a jerk. But I need him to be on good terms with me. How should I do this?

20090309210529AAlDApH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is okay really ever ok?	so i went out with this guy peter for about a year. to sum up our relationship he could make me feel the best ive ever felt and then the worst. he cheated, we broke up, he appologized. we got back together, he cheated we broke up, we got back together, etc...       well now four months later im with a guy named zach. he doesnt give me butterflies or make my heart beat fast. he doesnt make me blush, but he doesnt make me cry. he doesnt use me. he doesnt lie. he doesnt make me feel bad at all, but he doesnt make me half as happy as peter did.       so i guess all together hes average and our relationship is adiquate. its nothing great but nothing bad. i guess what im trying to ask is should i just stop looking for that mind numbing, heart pumping, palms sweating kind of feeling that i know is out there because ive felt it before or just settle for okay?

20090309211221AAqkB40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you don't have Fancy Career aspirations( Engineer, technical)Women will never like you?	I'm 29 . I have no dreams of a great career. All i want is a simple Office Assistant job or Filing or something of that sort. And i don't see anything wrong with it. Some people go back to college etc and like learning new skills , I prefer to do that on my own by going to the library.       I've heard many Women who want their man to be great and have a great job. But what's wrong with having a simple job? I dont think there's anything wrong.      I already went to college and I dont want to go there again. Plus i dont have money PLUS i dont enjoy schools at all and i don't learn in school-type environments.       One of example of the Women that think Men who dont have great careers are crap are Asian American women. Everytime i hear Asians Americans or read Asian forums.. they always talk about having great high pay careers and how they think poor men are stupid.

20090309214059AACuPq0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She Dumped me for another guy and i want her back?	Ok, that's just the gist of it, now that i have your attention here's the scoop      Late January i started dating this girl who i've liked since november.  I know she was really into me, that's not even denial on my part because she honestly really did like me.  She snuck out of her house and skipped school for an entire day just so we could spend the day together and she's not the type of girl who would do that for even her friends.      But then this guy who she had written out of her life a long time ago came back into the picture.  Apparently in high school she had this major crush on him but he was dating her best friend at the time.  Things got awkward between her and i for a few days, but i didn't know why she was acting so weird at the time then she finally told me that she really wanted to try a relationship with this guy.      I took the news really hard.  At first i thought that i was just the guy she came to when her life got boring but the night she told me about him she said, "i thought about not even telling you," which yea, means that she thought about cheating on him with me but the only reason she wouldn't tell me is because she still had feelings for me and she wanted to see where her and i were going to go as well.      Anyways, i stopped talking to her for a couple of weeks, then we started texting again, and now were going to a concert wednesday.  We've been friends since november and we decided to revert back to that for now but the thing is i don't know if i can do that.      I want to get her back and any of you can try to talk me out of it but it's probably not going  to work so please don't waste your time.      Anyways, i wrote her a song a while ago so tell me if you think this is a good plan.      A few nights after the concert i tell her that i know exactly how i want her in my life and i'm sorry but i can't be just friends with her.  Then i tell her i hope she's happy with him and that i can't just wait around for them to finish what they've started.  that if things don't work out between them then she should give me a call and if i'm not seeing someone else then her and i will go from there.  Then give her a recording of the song i wrote for her (trust me, it's good :)) and tell her that i don't think that any of this will change her mind but i just think she deserves to know how i feel about her and just how amazing she really is.      And i know i sound like a pathetic geek who doesn't get out much and whenever a girl enters my life in a romantic sense i get overly attached.  I really did get overly attached to her, but honestly i'm kinda a man whore (not a good thing, i'm just sayin), but she was different.        I either want her in my life romantically or not at all, so with that being said do you guys think that this is a good approach? or is there a better one?  And i really really don't wanna be stuck in the friend zone with this girl because i can't think of her that way anymore.      Please help

20090309214233AAnU45l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you ever reconnected with an old flame?	We got into a huge fight before we parted. Now we have not spoken for months. I am not sure if he will ever contact me. I do not plan on contacting him, but of course, I miss him.      We both have responsibilities for what provoked the fight. I do take the larger share. However, I think he knows why I was so angry at him.      I know he loved me...but I'm wondering if he has let it go forever. I am okay with that, but I will be sad! Are guys likely to hold grudges? I know that girls can be very stubborn when it comes to not being the one to break the silence.

20090309214412AAcJjea	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm in love with a married man...?	He's my boss. I do not feel ready for a new relationship yet, since my most recent one ended 6 months ago. Also I need to finish my studies. So, no stable boyfriend for me now. But, I do have feelings for this man... . And, as vulgar as it may seem, I have some basic needs...       He has been clear and said that he would never leave his wife, because he is too old for me (we have 25 years of age difference). He said that it's an impossible love, and that if I decide to see him again, that we should take from each other what we can and accept the fact that we can't make our lives together. He said that he has feelings too, and that he was in love ''in a certain type of way'', that he cnould not tell me more because he does not want to create false hopes.       I have not seen him outside the job for a while, resisting temptation. But it's difficult, since a  lot of times he comes back to me. I always have to say no. But then when it comes from me, he tells me to really think about it before making a move, so that I won't be hurt.       I feel that I have something to live with him, but at the same time, I am really afraid.       Also, he's my boss, there's no way I am losing that job, I need it for my studies !      I'll make my final decision from those answers...       Thanks for your time, I feel quite depressed.

20090309220501AAvijJ3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I use my ability to get girls??? ANSWER PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	My ability is this: I can think of anything quickly in any situation. For insance, I can forget all my homework for a class and I will get out of it by just thinking of sum excuse or sumthin 2 do real quick. I also have a business talent. I can think of a business/way to make money off of anything. I can also debate either side of anything. I often find my mind wandering into the realm of philosophy and thinking about astronomical type stuff.      My point is not to brag but to ask how I could utilize this to talk to girls. I'm 18 and never had a girl. I dont even know what to say to girls...If I was to walk up to a girl on the street, I would say hello, tell her my name, ask for hers and then just go blank probably. The thing tho is that if I knew anything about talking to girls, I would be TOO nice wit spittin game. Please just tell me the type of stuff girls like to hear....I'll take it from there.

20090309215611AAqmB6s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I call him and apologize?	I was with a guy all last summer, i ended things early fall, then we got back together this past december.  In January, things got pretty intense, and then.. to be quite honest, i don't remember exactly what triggered it.. but we had a huge falling out and i vowed not to speak to him again and i was ashamed of myself for ever having any kind of relationship with him. at the same time, he told me that i was never good for him, etc. we left things really terribly, to say the least. i haven't thought about him at all in the past month and a half or so, until recently when his band's songs have been appearing  on shuffle. it got me thinking back to when we were "us." granted, it was never a good relationship, but we did care very, very much for one another. i know i can't see him/talk to him (as frequently as we did) ever again due to my own emotional needs, etc, but I feel as though I owe him an apology for the way I (sometimes) treated him, and for the hurtful things I said to him during our last conversation.  I miss his friendship and conversation, but I cannot let myself slip back into those intense feelings I used to have for him-- it would ruin me. Should I call him to reconcile?  I know this is all very choppy, but I'm confused right  now. I took his songs coming onto my iTunes as a sign, but I'm just not sure...
20090309215758AA75jAd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?	I bet you've had many a question about this but you men are just that confusing.       Alright. So the place is my math class. There is this guy in front of me... lets call him Jake. I sorta like him and I think he likes me. He's always looking back at me (yes me not my work lol) during class and tries to make me laugh. He looks back every time I say something and smiles at me a lot. After class he likes to walk with me a little bit before we go our separate ways. On Friday we had to fill things out about things like who we thought had best hair, most athletic, ect. So I decided to put him as best smile and prettiest eyes. So when I went to math and said "Jake! I voted you prettiest eyes!"and he was like all smiley and said thanks or something but it was a super cute smile. Anyway so then I was like "I don't know your last name so I just put like... p. 5 delia(math teacher) or something" and then he said "well I'm the only jake so they'll probably get it. *insert more smiles here*" and even though that was all that was said... the atmosphere changed, you know? Like I could feel something. Anyway so then I was looking in my pencil bag for something to stick to his back and I found this heart I made out of the slip to go to the vice principal's office. And then I was like "Jake!" and he turned around right away.. And I swear his eyes had changed color. They're usually a grey-ish blue but at that moment they were this beautiful ocean blue. Not grey at all...anyway, I had put it on his other shoulder and I was like "There! there it is! *pointing to the floor* Get it, it's super important!" and he picked it up and smiiiled more and then he said "Thanks, I gotta get you something too"... And today he kept looking back at me and smiling at me as usual. And talking to me. I hurt my thumb this morning. I broke my super long natural nail past the part it connects to the skin and it seemed as if he cared...      After reading my novel... what do you think?

20090309215543AAkdKlW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question about Attachment Issues?	I have a weird thing going on in which I develop 'attachments', for lack of better word, with people. It has only really happened twice majorly, and minorly throughout my life.      I feel I need to tell people I develop attachments to everything that is going wrong, or just wanting to be near them period. It has been disrupting my whole life and now just only got worse. It is in no way romantic, its more familial than anything. But I also have trust issues and so I can't trust anyone, therefore making the situation more complicated. It causes emotional pain as well, if I disappoint the person or I fail to 'connect' with them. Is there a name for something like this? Has anyone else dealt with something similar to this? Answers are appreciated.

20090309220022AA9sxOv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex-Wife Has Me Confused...REALLY CONFUSED?	I was with my ex-wife for 12 years. Divorced last summer, have 2 kids. We have not got along since the divorce. She started dating another guy about one month after the divorce. They are still together. So for the last week we have been having talks on the phone regarding the kids. She has turned the talks from the kids into personal things. How are you? I want the best for you, I hope you succeed in life, etc. So today for the first time in 8 months we sat on my porch and talked. She spoke about how she cant get the connection with anyone else that her and I had. She misses the way we were. She asked if I thought we could go out for a drink sometime and "Try to keep our hands off each other once we got drunk". She told me she misses me and how we were a family and how we could talk about anything. So after an hour she finally got the kids and left and hugged me goodbye-but it was more than just a simple hug. It was a long one, for like a minute-that ended with a big sigh by her. Now clearly-after 12 years, I still love this woman. It's been on my mind all day since it happened. I am trying to read into what she could possibly be thinking with the actions of today, because as I said, her and I DO NOT DO THIS> It has been bitter since the divorce-very bitter. And perspective into what may be going on here? I'm VERY confused and conflicted. Thanks for all answers.

20090309220440AAhda0h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Good birthday present for 26 yr old guy i've been dating for a few weeks, his birthday is St. Patrick's Day?	So I've known him for about 8 years through mutual friends and hung out on several occasions in the first 4 years when i was married. Now i am divorced for 2 years and we have reconnected on a different level in the past few weeks. We've gone out twice, had him over for dinner once, and text throughout the day and talk on the phone every night. Nothing serious yet, just taking our time. So his birthday is March 17th and i need to do something for him, but nothing over the top since this is all still really new. He is a true country boy, hunting, fishing, boating, mud ridin', shooting pool, and just hanging out is what we do here. So does anyone have any ideas for any appropriate gift and/or celebration for him without coming on too strong??
20090309220456AAOX0hN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I stay in my relationship?	I've been with my girl for about a year now and sometimes I think that my girlfriend is truly crazy. Things were kind of rocky in the beginning due to her (likings) but I stuck it through. The thing is that as of late its gotten really bad. If she calls me and i don't answer she calls me like another 50 times with in a time span of like 10 minutes. She tells me that I can't talk with no girls because the only girl I should be talking to is her yet she has guy friends which by the way she knows are after her because they wanna get with her. She loves to post her pictures on the internet to get response from guys but if a girl friend request me or comments me on myspace for example or even out in the street, she goes ballistic. She tells me all of the time that she likes some famous people, like she thinks that they are hot or sexy, no biggie we all do I mean that's what they are there for right? But if I even say that a actress or female singer is pretty........forget about it. Also she seems to hate anything that women do. Singing, acting, wrestling, sports, whatever it is. I think she is somewhat out of her mind and i haven't even gotten to the half of it.

Her parents broke us up and said that I was not good for her and that i'm not the guy that she always visualized she'd be with. Now that I've grown up i realized that she must of left on her own free will... because no one can make you stop loving someone. Her name is outlawed in my house and mom threw out all of our pictures from the 2 proms we went to.. yet if she were to call me to apologize and work on a friendship i'd accept it..its not that im dying to be with her again.. Because i really do believe i'm past that... but I view it as a chapter in my life that I never finished writing. She was my best friend also for 3 years... i haven't spoken with the person i've  spent the most time in my life with besides my  direct family and it bothers me. I want to make peace with her so bad and it just haunts me. there still has not been one day where i don't think about her. her way of coping was very destructive by  thinking the worst of me so I don't think approaching her would be a good idea..She drinks a lot, get smashed... sleeps around. totally doing everything she said she'd never do. Everything she used to view as weakness in other girls.Deep down in my heart i feel she did this to try and convince herself she hates me.. but i think one day she will come around and face her problems...Im going to let another year go by...see if her anger towards me can heal and maybe some of my pain...Will I always suffer like this?

Okay, so this guy has liked me for a year now and I have never shown my affection back to him, even tho I do like him! he is my best friend I think I may even love him. We spent the day together and we kissed and just watched a movie together, but he has a girlfriend who he has only dated for two weeks and she is 5 years younger than him and is really imature. I don't know what to do, should I talk to him about going out? I really love him!

20090309221855AAi9bIn	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't get it, y am i so different?...?	How is it, when a guy likes a girl, the first thing he looks at are the girl's looks. THEN personality, maybe. See, im soooooo different from any other girl really.  hate to shop, tomboyish STILL, not girly watsoever, hate the color pink, and i dont just follow the crowd. I'm not trying to be sexist against girls or anything, but it just seems im sooo different. Is anyone else like me? I like this one guy but he just wants to be friends. (as always) all of my bestest guy friends just want to stay friends, is it cuz im not girly enough? i dont get it! If you knew me, i'd be TOTALLY different. I'm smart, pretty, and very easy ro get along with. It's just not the same way with me and other girls. I get along better with guys and my soccer friends, and i feel alone in this. the question im asking is why is it im so different from any other girl? and does anyone else feel the same way?

20090309221851AAv4FiT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does she seem like a good friend?	Alright, so last year I was best friends with this girl, but then we kind of grew apart, but we still hang out and talk a ton! Her birthday was lat week, and I was the only one who decorated her locker and gave her bday shoutouts. But anyways, yesterday was my brithday and she forgot all about it, but she remembered a different girls brithday which is the day after mine. But, she planned a party for this grl which was like yesterday night, it was a sleep over. She invited me, but I didn't go.   Like I wanted to sort of go, but I didn't. I think it may have been because its spring break, and I didnt get why she had to throw the other girls party on my birthday but im not sure. I dont want to seem selfish, so if im acting like it, sorry.   but now, my friend is mad at me, like, i dunno what to do.    Please, give me advice!!

We've been dating for 8 months now and every time she gets her period she gets really sick. She throws up at least several times, gets headaches and has really bad cramps.

We used to have a lot of fun together, not so much now. The other guy is someone who i have been friends with for 5 years. we have lots of things in common but enough differences to make it interesting. We have common goals, history,  etc. I truly love both of them but in different ways. My family love my husband and thinks he is perfect for me. They have also met my friend and like him also, before i got with my husband my dad asked me why I wasn't dating him (the friend).     Not real sure what to do here.       If your just gonna bash me and call me a cheater don't bother writing anything. I have not messed around with the other guy since I have been married.

20090309223708AAVEzN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i even pursue the relationship with this guy?	okay,   here's the issue:   I met this guy in one of my classes.   we started talking like a week ago, and -instant connection-.   We're in the stage right now where we talk non-stop   on the phone. we're constantly texting eachother.   It's like we never run out of things to talk about...   can't see a problem with that?   here it is...   I'm only 18 and he's 25..with a 6 year old kid.   this would be an obstacle for me, but if i really liked this   guy, i would be more than willing to change my lifestyle...   but that's not all...   problem #2:   He's decided that he wants to stay abstinent until marriage.   -yeah-   he has been abstinent for over a year now and he is    very dedicated (due to religious reasons) to keep his promise   to himself.   first off, i'm not very religious.   second off, i rather enjoy sex.  not just sex, but intimacy   all together.  he has said that he finds it hard to even kiss   because it leads to too much temptation...      should i even pursue this relationship?   I really like this guy...   but i don't know if it would be immature of me to   go after a man that is obviously on a very different   stage of life than i am...       sorry i wrote so much!!!   :]   thanks guys!

I was dating this 13 year old girl for maybe a week (i am 15 years old) i felt attracted to her at first then i dont know something happened and i just wasn't attracted to her anymore so i broke up with her.      recently however i considered asking her back out as i guess im sort of a lonely kid.      i find out that she has a new boyfriend who's 16 which i think is wrong and to make matters worse this guy is a pot smoker and a stoner which i dont think is good for her but i cant really say anything.      recently i've been feeling overly jealous and i normally don't   how can i stop myself from feeling jealous when i see them at school?

20090309224412AAvyfNF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I care for a longtime friend, what should i do about it?	Used to be friends when we younger - like since i was 3. We used to spend all the time together... I remember like watching the stars with her, swinging on the swings, just runing around the neighborhood - good times! Now im like 20, we still stay in contact. Get together here and there, like a once a month sort of thing - parties and stuff. But now i know i'll have a very hard time getting close to her because she's been through alot more then i have. She's been living on her own for like 4 years - shes dated before, and is just a lot maturer then me. As for me, I've been traped at home going to community college and never been close to a girl! I've had a couple of heart to heart talks with her but never had the courage to just tell her much I care for her. I guess im afraid of making things ackward between us. I know she cares for me but can't tell if she could ever see me attractively. I don't think im man enough for her - I've seen the posters in her room of the guys she's attracted to. I'm not quite her type. I don't know why i care for her so much - perhaps it's just our childhood, I don't know. But I want her and don't want to screw things up. I think i will remain friends untill i finally get out of my gosh dang house, start living in the real world and gain some confidence. But the thing is she's starting to date this one guy and it's making my stomach churn. I don't know whether to tell her or what?...

20090309224708AA1Ug3I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She loves me but misses her ex and finds it too hard to let go and at the same time doesn't want to lose me.?	I guess my crazy question above pretty much said everything.      I met my girlfriend about 8 months ago and we've been living together since.      About 2 months into our relationship I found out that a good friend of hers was actually her boyfriend for 4 years before we met, and that noone was supposed to know that they're a couple for some bizarre reasons.      A month later they officially broke up and I managed to stay calm and caring throughout the entire ordeal. He went overseas for 3 months and everything was great until he returned. She continued seeing him (as a friend she claimed) but I found secret messages of love and lust. I confronted her but again I decided to take it easy and gave her another chance.      Never once I threatened to kick her out of the door, and never once did I feel like I'm losing my love for her. I stuck by her through her 'I'm-just-going-to-see-him-as-a-friend' period until she admitted that she still misses him and she finds it so hard to let go.      I even told her before that if she wants to be with him, she can leave anytime and I will not condemn her actions. I will let her stay with me until she finds a place and I will still be nice to her. She told me that she wouldn't want to lose me and that she will try her best to forget and let go.      Just this weekend we had another falling out because she did something stupid in attempt to ruin her ex's relationship with another girl and she felt extremely upset about it.       That's about everything until now, of course there are so many details that happened on a daily basis but I'll spare everyone off that.      Here's the thing: She said she loves me heaps, she wants to have a future with me but at the same time she is finding it very hard to let go and even if she were to leave me, she doesn't want to be with her ex anymore.      WHAT'S GOING ON!? I myself can't seem to let go under pretty much any circumstances and I have stuck by her every inch of the way until now but I feel like I'm being taken for granted again and again and again just because I couldn't and I don't want to let her go. I want to help her forget so we can finally move on but at the same time I know it's bad that I'm doing this to myself.. It's not fair.
20090309225446AAPKkVA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this possibly a condom/latex allergy?	I have never had sex without a condom, and after each session, I never really enjoyed it. I would feel swollen and tender for a few days, sometimes itchy - almost feels like friction burn - and on more then a few occasions, I got a UTI (urinary tract infection). So I didn't have sex that often.      The last time I did, I had sex without a condom and I've had none of those symptoms, at all!      Could this be another allergy I have to add to my list??      ** I'm already allergic to bee stings (anaphalactic), bandaids (mild to moderate) and suspect penicillin (mild) due to a rash, I don't really want to add another **
20090309234120AAiHkCL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I jealous to my best friend?? Please help me...?	Okay I've been best friends with him since who knows when (lost count- more then 3 years) and he say's that I'm his best friend too.   Anyways, at school when we get to see each other he say's that he has to walk really fast to his next class or else he will be late (and the 5 minute bell hasn't rung yet). While later in the day, he walks with another friend (who i'm friends with too) and he takes his time and they ran late to class yesterday (the friend is in my math class, that's how I know).   Anyways, it's really bothering me that when we're together he walks fast and when they're together they walk slow. Too, I talked to our friend about that and she say's that "he always walks slow" so that bugs me way more. idk why it bothers me, but I'm thinking could it be jealousy that I feel??   How can I fix this problem the best way??      He doesn't like the girl. He likes someone else. Too, I talked to him about it and he said that they're coming from the same class and he has nothing else to do besides talk to her.

20090309231139AAO5VP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Competing with a beautiful girl for a beautiful guy. Help!?	Well, I'm really attracted to this one guy because he has a cute smile, very intelligent, sensible and funny. Well, this girl who happens to be my nemesis is incredible intelligent, funny and amazingly beautfiul. After she found out that I like this guy, she's been using her sly attracting tactics. Wearing short shorts around, laughing and showing happiness. Gets really close to him where they are close enough to kiss be she doesn't. She's really beautiful, so of course he lusts for her. aaaaggghhh. I might as well throw in the towel to hell because I am not very funny or beautfiul and my intelligence is limited to text books. He's a jock. His intelligence is mainly in the opposite field. I do realize that I shouldn't even try put a hand in my losing battle but just for desperate's sake, what could I possibly do to compete with this girl?
20090309231238AArVWDP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this girl?	Alright let me give you a little background information before I go into the question. I'm a junior in high school and there's this girl who has been in my life for about a year. Last summer I went out with her for a couple weeks and she left me for this guy who I later became semi-friends with. She broke up with him a couple weeks after getting together with him and then when school started up again this year she went out with me again. She then broke up with me again for the same guy...and she broke up with him again a couple weeks later. The girl and I have become close friends since the beginning of the school year and I have tried to be as nice as I could to her because I've still got feelings for her. I just got information over the weekend from a friend who told me she likes me again. Now normally I would just forget about this because she would probably leave me again, but the guy she left me twice for has long since been forgotten by her. Now I am asking all of you whether or not I should go out with this girl. I really really like her and now that I have the opportunity to go out with her again (hopefully for more than a few weeks this time) I don't know if I should take the opportunity and risk a good friendship or not. Thank you.
20090309231536AAUf6l1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you think she feels?	I have a friend that has mixed emotions, one day shes happy and nice, the next she wont talk. She's the like that likes to feel sorry for herself and shows it. So I was cool with her, Im really nice, and she randomly said your so attached to girls, I guess it was because I was talking to all the girls while most of the guys watched. And I found this disrespectful, so I decided to be cool about it and not deal with her mood swings. So since that day I've never really approached her to say hi, if she saw me i fake a little smile, but will only hug her if she comes for it, I also try not to talk to her as much as possible, even if shes standing there while im flirting with some girl. I don't understand her, so I don't want her to say something stupid again when I am actually very nice. But what would be on your mind if a guy did this to you?
20090309232806AALqWib	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it the right time to ask her out?	Well to get things start, there is this girl I know. She is extremely beautiful and I really like her a lot. I've gotten to know her really well over the past several months. She goes on dates here and there with people. Her and I've gone on several dates as well. She likes to hug me and tickle me and such a lot which tends to be signs of someone liking you. She is well aware that I like her. I've kissed her once, and then occasionally on the cheek and the like, however she's never kissed me but never stopped me from kissing her. She tells me things like I always know the right thing to say to cheer her up. She tends to call me when she's upset even late. I do worry sometimes if maybe she has friend zoned me, or if she just likes to date but doesn't want anything else or not. But as I've gotten to know her I honestly don't think her to be the type, but its why I'm here.      On valentines I didn't ask her out cause I figured she'd already have a date cause so many guys like her, and got kind of upset when she was going to this party on valentines, she eventually said that she did it cause nobody asked her at all, and she heard I was going with someone else, and she was upset I was going with someone else, but I wasn't. So I asked her, she said yes, we went out, I bought her flowers and all etc. And ever since she's seemed closer to me.      She also flirts with me often and has even told me somethings that she doesn't tell others, and I don't mean something you'd tell a friend, something you'd tell someone your with.      So, I guess I wanna know what everyone thinks, do you think she's just a flirty girl? Cause she does flirt occasionally with people but she doesn't do bad things or anything.      If you think I should ask her to be more than just friends, or go beyond little dates, how should I do it? Any help is appreciated.

I know I made some bad decisions a while ago, I chose a bad group of friends and they got me in some trouble (nothing with the law) i just stayed out past curfew sometimes and she still brings it up and that was like 2-3 years ago.

20090309233518AAQiPb4	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help dealing with my grandpa's health?	Tonight I was just sitting around minding my own business when my mother came to my bedroom door. It looked like she had been crying. I ask her "what?" and she motioned me to come out to the living room, where my dad was on the phone. I asked her "what happened?" and began to tear up. My mom said "listen to your dad". My dad called my uncle and was telling him that my grandpa was in the hospital. My grandma had taken him to one hospital 15 miles from where they lived and he had an MRI done and it showed that he had a growth in his neck. I guess he'd had some neck pains lately, but didn't think it was bad and yet decided to go to the chiropractor. (My grandpa is 64 years old).    They took him back to their town's hospital, where he is now being monitored. My grandpa used to smoke (way before I was born-I'm 19 years old now) and he still chews tobacco, but not as often as he used to.   I'm really scared. They're gonna run a biopsy on his growth, but everything is still scary for me. I don't know what to do. My grandpa is the person who taught me to sing. He helped me learn to play the guitar. He was in a band at our campground, and included me in it. He's the only person in my family who encourages my love of music. He means the world to me. He's my best friend. I could always trust him with any of my problems...and if this thing is cancerous, what am I going to do? I feel like I'm going insane right now.       Please help me with your support, your thoughts, and your experiences with this kind of situation...

20090309233031AATUxKz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? I guess he does?	This guy has so many school periods with me that we used to sit together in Language Arts and we talked randomly about things.    - It would go something like this:   "Ugh, im so tired today," he smiled, yawned, and stretched , "I went to this party late at night"   "Oh, I stayed up too doing nothing really." I said.   Smiled again and turned back into his seat.      OK that is only one example:   I finally got the guts to ask him a question about something for history. he is like "I don't know. I'll ask for you." He asked the teacher and told me the answer to the question.      So now and then when i laugh at his jokes and I smile really big he smiles back at me.       Now we moved our seats so it is all different now but I still talk to him a tiny bit and just yesterday he asked me a question about history too.      So the question is does he like me?

20090309233838AAx56Xd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a good thing to give into the peer pressure of kissing him?	There is this guy that I have been going out with, and we hear all the time that we are a cute couple, and it's quite true. Whenever we are together, we either get pushed even closer together, not that we are close enough. Or, they physically turn our head to face each others, intentionally wanting us to kiss. Although I don't mind kissing him, I want to know if this is showing him that I give into peer pressure easily. Sometimes, they want us to kiss, or make out, just to make someone jealous. As for me, that's not the way to go, or even mature. I feel like I should kiss him because I love him. So, please help, I don't know what to do!

20090227113521AAb2zkc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	All of you who claim you would marry someone with bad credit?	Are you currently married?  Does your spouse have bad credit?  Do you?  If you're not currently married have you ever BEEN married to someone with bad credit?      Personally I think it is very idealistic to say that love conquers all and that you'd marry someone with horrible credit.  I'd like to know what happens when something unforseen happens and you need to access credit to pay a bill or take care of an unplanned medical expense?  Generally the way someone handles their money when their single is how they'll handle it when they're married and most people (I said most not all) with horrible credit got that credit by their own doing.  So tell me, do you feel it's idealistic to think that good credit and proper financial management is not a requirement for a happy, healthy, successful marriage.  Keep in mind that money is 2nd only to infidelity in the leading cause of divorce.
20090227133609AAiD9oT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this fair? or am I over reacting?	I met this guy well over 5 years ago, and then I moved away but we stayed in touch. He's now my best friend I wouldn't change it for the world. Its never gone any further than friends and neither of us would want it to.   However, here's the problem......his girlfriend of 2 years, who I have never met because we live really far away from eachother, well she emailed me today saying:      "Hi, hope this doesn't come across as mean but I know you & my boyfriend have been talking a lot, I dont mind him being friends with you, but I'm sure u kno tht me and him have been having problems and I'd like you to back off so that we can sort things out."      Well, I spoke 2 another guy friend who lives near him & is his best friend too...& he thinks its totally out of order. apparently they've been having problems for months now & she hasnt asked anybody else 2 "back off". tbh, neither of us could actually figure out how me "backing off" would help their relationship........   I was tempted 2 tell her to go f*ck herself coz I'm not giving up my friends for nobody...but I didnt want to cause him more problems.      What is her problem???????

Up until recently I had no problem dating a separated man because I believed him when he said they were divorcing. Our dating life is normal in all that we do. He lives like a single man and me his girlfriend! We stay at his place or mine 3-4 nights each week we aren't in hiding or sneaking around. Our families, friends and co workers are aware of our relationship. Basically EVERYTHING is on track except he is married.      PROBLEM: Both of my 2 best friends (1married 16yrs & the other 12yrs) has said it's time for me to demand proof that divorce has been filed. Would this be an ultimatum? Should I just cut off communication cold turkey? It won't be easy since we both have valuables at each others house. Please tips on walking away.

Like how many months, weeks, years did it take to think they were the right person. did you "know" the first time you met them? i have been going out with my boyfriend for a couple of months. we are both early thirties. When I saw his profile picture I just thought "oh my god!"  and we met up and it's been great. on the first date I thought this is going to be the man I marry. I know it sound ridiculous, but I feel I just know. Any thoughts?
20090310000751AA1wdcV	Family & Relationships;Family	Will this change work for us?	Well I have a 21 month old son and I am currently 10 weeks pregnant with my second child. I work nights from 8:00 pm - 4:30 am. I get MAYBE 4 hours of sleep a day. And thats only in pieces. I get about 2 hours after I get home and finally fall asleep and then maybe another 2 when my son takes a nap. This schedule and lack of sleep on top of being pregnant and sick is absolutely killing me! My hubby works full time during the day and I work at night because we can't afford daycare and we don't want our son in it. I really want to switch to working part time. Probably two 10 hour days on the weekend nights. I have gone over all over our bills and as long as I downgrade the cable, the cell phone, get rid of the internet, and conserve more of electricity and spenidng on things like eating out and shopping I think we can make it fine. We will have to cut back on going out and doing things but we are fine with that. I just can't go on with this schedule. I am literally ready to fall over and just call it quits! I am nervous about asking my manager for fear that she may say no. I was thinking of asking my Dr. to give me some kind of recommendation to switch to part time because this schedule just isn't healthy for me. Do you think a Dr. would do this? Does anyone have any tips on how to save more money on bills? I would like to get rid of my hubby's car but we would be way in the whole on that one. I just need some advice and sugestions. Do you think it is plausible? I currently make 12.52 per hour. Plus another 1.50 on top of that for night differential. And if I work on the weekends at night i would make another 1.50 on top of that an hour for weekend differential. That would put me at about 15.52 an hour. I think just my portion of the bills will still cost me around $1000 per month. So what do you think? I need advice and encouragement! This is a big step and a big change. I am really scared.

20090310002148AAN1mt5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would you do in this situation?	Let's say that you were walking through the park and you happened to see a missing persons poster with the picture of a teenage girl on it. After reading it, you continue on your way, but then suddenly notice a young girl sitting alone on a park bench looking at her cell phone. Something about the girl looks familiar until you realize that it is the very same girl that you saw on the poster! Having no doubt in your mind whatsoever about who she is, what would you do? Would you approach her and try to talk to her, or would you call the police, child services ect? For me personally, I would try go up and talk to her, but I want to know what others would do in this situation?

20090310011330AAQ53Tv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you have done in this situation?	My Son's Mother and I own a home together. We still sleep in the same bed and we even have sex every now and again! Until She told me she was dating this other guy! I was extremely mad! She slept with this guy like 4 times at his house but she did nothing and I believe her! Well 1 week after she made this decision I caught her and him in my bed in my own home! They were clothed for I gave them no time to do anything! I did not assault him but I did show him where the door was! Well after a few other things he split up with her! So now I am trying to keep my family together while she is blowing me off. Well tonight I decided to give her a little space and I went to my cousins house. I was over there for 4 hours. When I came back home she was in bed. Well next to our bed is a box of condoms in which I count all the time now. My last count was 4 and I looked down to 3 and a wrapper! I was extremely mad once again! So I asked her did she have sex with someone in our home! She repetedly said no! Well I asked her to prove to me that she was not lieing! I asked her to show herself to me and let me smell her without even touching her. I felt that this was the only way to prove that she was telling the truth for you can notice a different smell on someone who recently had sex. Well she said hell no for about 20 minutes and finally decided to prove herself. She did to an extent but I did not believe her still due to a smell. So she called her sister and took my son with her saying I was Psycho for wanting to know the truth. After she left I went searching for the condom and I did find the 4th condom still in the wrapper! So she was telling me the truth! So my question what would you have done in this same situation. By the way I did appologize and I am truely deeply sorry I did not believe her!
20090309200635AAsHjCI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone help with boy trouble, ugh...?	Okay...   So.   There's this guy, and he ended up finding out that  have feelings for him, and he told me over the phone that he would ask me out, in person because over the phone was not proper.   And his previous relationship didn't end well, he was dumped, and then he told me that he needed time to think. Which I understand, because he may have cold feet, or be afraid that I could do the same thing to him. Then he told me that "Not to sound shallow or anything, but when Im single I usually like more than one girl so Im extremely indecisive right now.." etc.   This was two weeks ago, and now we've been talking normal..   but apparently now he likes two girls, and he claims he has a chance with either one. And I have a feeling one could be me, but I really liked this guy.. and he may end up picking someone else, and I may not even be one of the two.   So, I need any tips or advice on how to overcome this situation, what I should do in the meantime and weather I should confront him or not.. and what to say?   Im so confused right now, I don't know where I should begin.   And all my friends either want to beat him up, which I made clear to them not to do, or they think I should keep talking to him in a friendly manner.   Some say I should just forget about him altogether, but they don't understand, it's not that simple.

20090227114614AAEDtNk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To the those married over 35, what can I do to feel sexy and attractive?	My husband gives me the occasional compliment standard "you look nice".  Says I love you.  But it doesn't make me feel very desirable.  I long for the days when I felt like I was pretty and men would want me.  I work out daily, dress well (love shopping), and feel and look better than I have since getting married - I'm 43.  But sometimes I have trouble reminding myself why I bother.  Why not wear sweat pants, get fat and get rid of the makeup, oh and cut off my long hair.  Sex doesn't happen very often.  I think I'm having a midlife crisis. I worked in the past and I think that helped with all this need for attention but now I can't work (long story but have to take care of children and can't hurt them for my own selfish reasons). Has anyone ever had to deal with this before, guys and girls?  What did you do?

20090227114111AAGBqXE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I really this crazy? Bipolarisms haunting me!?	I have a long laundry list of issues, that I will spare you kind folk.   My most difficult one to manage is my being bipolar.   What worse, some crazy guy fell in love with me and was dumb enough to marry me!!      He and I both go to my crazy people doctor appointments.   My doctor told me that I have a tendency to be self destructive because I do not believe that he loves me. And that I have a tendency to push away anyone who becomes close to me. He said I subconsciously start behaving so badly that I expect them to stop loving me.      That my way of dealing with possibly being hurt is to just eliminate any possibility of love in my thought and actions.      After that, I thought maybe he should be seeing a shrink.   Can anyone help me to better understand what that means.   I can't wrap my brain around it.         My poor husband :)
20090227143959AAM0kCr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I think her boyfriend abuses her!?	There's a girl at my school and I think her boyfriend may be physically abusing her. Well, one time I was walking by in the hallway and I saw them together. I didn't see the whole thing, but what I did see was him pushing her and then she walked off and looked really mad/scared. He was calling her name but she kept walking. There were also numerous times that she looked upset when she was walking with him in the hallway. The time he pushed her was about 2 months ago but I see her look upset frequently. I may be to quick to assume but I don't want anything to happen to this girl. He's kind of buff and she's about average size, so let's just say he could really hurt her if he got mad. Also, she's a sophomore and I'm younger so I don't talk to either of them. What should I do?

Well I done it last night, we've been quite turbulent recently, sometimes we're good, sometimes we row with eachother, ultimately there were a fair few things which she seemed to do which made me unhappy which I tried to communicate with her but never seemed to change, she seemed to find me annoying when I was giving her attention if she wasn't in the mood, we seemed incompatible sexually as I always wanted it and she was more of a once or twice a week person and on the weekend we both got drunk and we had a massive row which ended up in people having to get involved to split us up because we were screaming and shouting at eachother (this started from me trying to dance with her, her not wanting to and dancing with her mates, me asking what the problem was and getting called clingy) ! I decided we had to call it a day there because that was unacceptable - most couples when they're drunk end up all over eachother, we're like the exact opposite!    She's really upset and can't believe I've ended it over this and I wish I didn't have to, I love her more than anything but the stress is near enough killing me with the rows... I'm now sitting there wondering if I've done the right thing and to go back to her or just to leave it for the best... it's really got me depressed :(

20090227130009AAhOHEg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why isn't anyone answering the question about chemistry?	In Hope's earlier question, many women said that chemistry was important in a relationship.  Then I asked "what is chemistry" and only 2 people answered, and those were sort of flimsy answers.      Is this one of those "woman" things that makes no sense, or it's some girly secret, and that's why no woman wants to try and explain it?

20090310001342AAOsKG0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This quiet girl is hard to read but i think she rejected me. should i text her tonight?	i've been going to my college's library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, because i like the girl who works there, since shes nice and good-looking. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing, compared to the others who work there   so last monday, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name.   last tues, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, hesitated, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about the upcoming weekend (which was this past weekend)? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town. i then asked about any time that week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop      finals are in a week from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up this week for coffee even if she agrees, since shes was busy last weekend, and last week, if shes was honest. maybe we can meet up 3 weeks from now, in the new semester?      i just called her tonight (its currently past midnight in my timezone) but she didnt answer. its been 2 hours now, and still no response      maybe she doesnt answer calls from numbers she doesnt identify?      should i text her? or is it obvious she rejected me?   i forgot to leave a message. should i call again?   OR   i could just wait to see her at the library tomorrow?

20090310013812AAhuPz1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this the right time to tell?	Prom is coming up. I'm going with this girl i love to death. (she doesn't know yet) I've been holding out on telling her since october because timing is everything and since October I've been having shitty luck and timing.       I've also have some other problems working against me.      1. My parents will not allow me to date until I'm 25   2. The relationship would never work if it was secret because my sister is a squealer who is also in high school.   3. My sister has a huge amount of friends which will spread the news even faster to my sister.    4. There is another guy who likes her but she told me directly that she didn't feel the same spark he felt for her. She DIDN'T tell him this.   5. My parents rarely let me leave the house. Yes they are overprotective and care too much. I would rarely see her if the relation ship worked.      Why are my parents like this?   They believe education should be the first priority in high school and shouldn't be distracted with relationships. This is nonnegotiable.      Is this the right time to tell? If not, then when? I'm willing to risk it all. I don't really know what the consequences would be.

20090227142148AA7MFhd	Family & Relationships;Friends	"bullying" issue in high school?	So basically, There's this guy that I've had a LOT of issues with. He was "in love" with my best friend, and kept saying he'd kill himself if she didn't love him, then he threatened to kill her. Later, he told me he wished he had.      Naturally, we no longer speak to him or anything. But now he keeps saying he's changed, etc, etc. I still wouldn't believe him and go back to being friends with him.      Now, whenever I see him, he makes snide, rude comments about me, and basically puts me down. I have to sit next to him at lunch (thats where all my friends are and we never switch seats) and he's always just saying "nobody cares" "you don't have any friends" "you're ugly," etc. I know thats stupid trivial stuff, but as someone who is recovering from a self-loathing problem and eating disorder, It really messes with me.      My problem is, everyone just thinks its high school drama. There's nothing I can do to make him stop, because I have no proof of the threats and things he's done. I try ignoring him, but it continues and I end up crying every day when I drive home from school. I'm afraid to walk past him in the hall, so I take the long way because I don't want to hear about how fat I am.      What is there for me to do?
20090227132503AAaZU9q	Family & Relationships;Friends	Jealous/Dont feel like im doing enough for my friend?	Well Here's a Few Examples..      - My BESTEST Friend,Georgia, Asked if she could get 2 yahoo accounts (in one of her questions) for asking 'private questions she dont want her friends to see'   We have been best friends for 11 years and i have never kept any secret from her, and i didnt think she had any from mee..   And i was sitting there thinking    'So she would rather complete strangers know about her personal problems than her best friend?'   :'(   Or am i just a Jealous Person? Or am i going way over the top?      Another example;   - Me and my other friend walk home and have really funny times and i go round her house quite a lot and i do feel out of order for leaving Georgia out but i always forget when we play the Playstation2.. But if i here them talking about something funny that happened beetwen them i always try really hard NOT to listen or to change the subject... Coz i think i get a bit jealous.. even thou georgia doesnt see her as much as me..   Am i a jealous person ? :(   i feel like she thinks other people would be better to talk to than me.. it isnt a bery nice fact to know..   what do i say to her ? i told her it makes me feel.. a lil depressed.. and now shes been trying to talk to me but i dont really know what to say coz i haevnt been talking for like 20 mins now.. im really so confused and i think im overreacting,  but.. idk!   Is our friendship fading? Why does she feel that they could help her more?!   i know its personal questions and stuff but, yunoo, i ask personal questions on my other account too (i only made this account to ask about this, coz i really dont want georgia to see this stuff about her)   i would ask the personal stuff on my other account!

Basically, we're both juniors in high school and good friends. But that's the catch - we're friends. I've asked her out (she said yes), and she says that she thinks she likes me and likes being with me. This was all 3 weeks ago.      But we're friends - we go out for lunch sometimes, and we don't do any "physical" things to each other (you know what I mean). How do I take it a step further? I really like her, but idk what it is - is she just not ready for a relationship?      It's fine if you guys give just a general answer about relationships. I know that it's impossible to give good help without really knowing us.      What do I ask her now? I can't say "will you go out with me" again, cuz that would just be stupid. What is the "next step"??

Then about 2 weeks about I told him how I liked him and he said he likes me too but its not enough to date me so I just was like Ok .   5 days later I found out he likes my friend Jessica and everyone found out he did and everyone knows she dosnt like him, so the next day i told him I knew and he said he was moving on from her and that he didnt like her that much anymore.    The problem is I dont know what to do.   I dont know if I should let him be because he dosnt like me enough and he also said it would be kind of awkward to date me...why? idk he never opens up to me.   So please tell me what would be best to do on a situation like this.   It would be very helpful.   Thanks!

20090309234819AAuNlmo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend the rock star.....?	He's in a rock band and i love him very much. I think i saw him checking me out when i freshened up after spending the night with the band, innocently. However, he was with his good friend and troy, as i'll call him, thinks the rock star life is about getting laid and wasted. I've known the band for a while now. They would not approve of that at all. what should i do?i'm not a groupie, the lead singer is like a dad to me, the bassist and other guitarists are uncles, and the drummer is like a brother... I'm not just some dreaming girl, this could happen...

20090309234632AAqnVQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just give up?	I am 31 yrs old. I just got "rid" of an abusive relationship of 16 yrs (married 10) its a long complicated story, but for years and years I have had a friend that even at one point was my X's friend, but over the years has become my best friend. For about 7 years I have told him that I loved him. I have loved him but in the last 6 mths I have fallen IN love with him. We live 800 miles from each other and my plan    (our plan) was for me to move closer to him. (not the problem, well financialy not related to my question) I need to move away 1. because of my X, but 2. I want so much to give "us" a fair chance after all this time. After 16 yrs we finally spent a weekend together... a first everything. It was wonderful like perfect, then we spent another weekend together, the hardest thing in my life was to get on the plane and come home. I am 100% convinced he is THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. After talking day and night, telling each other i love u's a million times a day, and talking about forever....he's backed away. Why? I know it all sounds so perfect. The reality is I have 4 children. 3 of which will be going with me. Hes scared. Of my kids (2 havn't seen him ages, 1 not at all) We decided not to rush into anything from the get go, but hes afraid of their father giving us problems and "poisioning" the kids minds to hate him, and since my children havn't been raised in exactly the best enviroment hes afraid of how they will take to him if at all. He has only been in 1 serious realtionship years and years ago and has no children of his own. Its understandable for him to be afraid, and I think if I was there it may be a little less fearful, but I'm having a hard time convincing him. This is also why we decided before we went any further with "happily ever after" we would have about a 6 mths "getting to know you time" for him and the kids. I feel like hes slipping away again and I don't want to lose him. Unfortunnatly its quite expensive to move with a single income. I don't want to pressure him, but I don't know when I can get there. I know he needs time, but I am willing to move mountains to be with him. I don't know what to do. I do know the only nights in the last 4 mths I havn't cried myself to sleep is when I was laying next to him.
20090309235100AA4WDgM	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother does not act nice to my daughter, what can I do?	I had my baby when I was 14, she is 15 now. She's my only child and she's my whole world, she's beautiful and very sweet and we're very close. But my mother will always blame any troubles I have onto my baby, she always says that I should have waited and not gone through with the pregnancy. Recently she's told me in front of my daughter that I would have more money now and a good husband if I hadn't had the baby. (I'm still single and I have enough money for myself and my child but I'm not rich, and I'm fine like this). She wanted me to be a surgeon or a lawyer which I haven't done, and she blames it on my baby. What should I do? I live near her and she visits me and I have to see her at family gatherings but she always brings something up around my daughter which hurts her feelings. I've told her to stop but it doesn't seem to work. What approach should I take and how can I make my child not feel sad about any of this?

I'm going out with this boy called Jamie and I know that he loves me very very much, and I did love him but I am having major doubts about our relationship. First of all, he smokes, and for some reason I really don't like people who smoke and he knows this yet he constantly smokes right in front of me. He says he doesn't like smoking in front of me BUT HE DOES. We have barely anything in common, and even my horoscope thingy says that if I got in a relationship with someone of his star sign it would be a disaster. I know you're all going to be like 'Just talk to him' but I know that if I do he'll just talk me back into this relationship that I really want to get out of. I'm so scared of hurting him-I know how bad he gets when he gets heartbroken and it's so sad to see-please help me. BTW I WANT detailed answers!

20090309184049AAMHD67	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wait for this guy I really like to make up his mind on if he wants me or his ex.?	Ok so I really like this guy we have been friends for a while & I knew he liked me, but at the time I was not interested in him. So he moved away and came back & I found out he finally got a girlfriend. She is 36 with 5 kids & he is 20. After a while I realized I liked him, and he admitted things were not working with them, because of the kids. So he ended things with her. We soon got together, but he felt sad for breaking up with her. They continue to hang out and she says I'm 19 and to young for him. He feels really confused and we have been together intimately and I feel really hurt and used. He says he feels he rushed into things to fast with me,because he needs to get over her completely. They still see each other everyday at tae kwon doe practice so my friends think that he will never get over her. He says they will always be friends. He also says he doesn't not want to be without me friend or girlfriend he wants me either way. I met the ex oneday and she told me not to hurt him which kind of sounds like she is accepting the fact that he likes me. But she continues to call him and beg him to be with her. I'm so confused I understand it is hard when you get out of a relationship, but it seems like he is leading me on. He also says he wants to make the right choice and doesn't want to get hurt in the end. So I told him he has until the end of the month to make his mind up. Is this the right thing to do?

I've included all debts in my name. I am not sure if after I file, my ex wife's bills will start to haunt me. I don't think IL is a community property state. So, I'm hoping I am not responsible for her credit card or past due utility accounts gone to collection that are solely in her name even though they occured before the divorce was entered. I do worry about those still.

My son has had baseball practice two times this week, to include a 1 1/2 hour batting cage session.  His baseball pants have completely irritated his stomach and caused his eczema to look bad.  I have used medicine on his stomach and since bought him some under armour to help.  Are these pictures going to destroy me in court?  He had practice on Thursday and went to visit her on Friday night, so it only got redder.  I just got my son back today and his stomach does look bad, but my ex took him to the doctor on Saturday.  I would have done the exact same thing had he been with me and now I am worried...

We talked to each other and gave each other advice about everything.       He ended up liking this one girl, who does not like me and visa versa, but he always never found the balls o ask her out. So i talked to her and then talked to him and tried to convince him to just ask her out. he finally did after 2 months, she said no because she was "over him,"        Then for some reason they talked one night, the next day my friend told me he didn't want to talk to me for a long time because I had "lied" to him about everything I told him.

He even stole old pictures of me w/an old boyfriend and text them to me along with pictures of women in sexual positions.  He has been secretly stock piling my personal items for months I had no idea he thought these things of me and had been methodically copying / keeping my stuff (even from old relationships) including my underwear, vibrators etc..

20090310001743AA50POp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My parents are getting a divorce and i feel so lost...?	Hey all. I'm 19 and I'm still living at home with my parents. Well the story is that my parents don't really get along that well. My father has been sleeping on the couch for about a year and a half now. (because of his snoring) and well recently they got in this fight. My mother said that she had had enough and asked my dad to leave. Now when she said this it broke my heart, but i told myself that it was only for awhile to let them cool off for a bit. And Ive been texting and calling my father and just keeping in touch talking about my day because i miss that. Well today my mom dropped the biggest bomb on me. She said that this is permanent....WHAT?!?!?!  Now that this lovely information has been thrown at me i feel completely depressed and lost. I'm lashing out in anger at my mother and just don't feel right.       Now, Ive been trying to take an adult approach to this, telling myself that some people just are not supposed to be with each other. But there's a part of me that wants to be the selfish kid and just wants his dad back and for everything to just go back to normal. And i know that perhaps in the long run this will all blow over and things will eventually be better. But right now...I'm just completely lost.      I guess what I'm asking is for some advice. Maybe from someone that has been through this before. Anything would be greatly appreciated.       Thank you
20090310001925AAP3WxM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HEY GUYS...WHAT do you think of this?	OKAY SO there’s Lola, Dean, Fred and Nina. All of them are best friends with each other, it’s like a group.   Some Facts -    = Dean used to like Lola, a lot. He adores her still but only as friends. He gets very jealous if she has anything to do with another guy.   = Fred and Nina, just recently got over this whole SECRET **** BUDDY thing they had going on which Fred never spoke about because he was embarrassed and Nina was confused about because she secretly hoped it would become something more, like on an emotional level.      = THE ISSUE IS that Fred likes Lola and Lola likes him too but Lola is having problems with everything in her life because everything has become stressful and isn’t sure if she can handle a commitment.   = Nobody knows that Lola likes Fred   = Dean and Nina are both aware that Fred likes Lola and so Dean is very angry at Fred because Dean used to like Lola so much and Nina is also angry at Fred.   Need advice on the following…   = Should Lola tell anybody how she feels even though she doesn’t want to go ahead with anything?   - Reasons for not going ahead are   - Doesn’t want to ruin the group   - Can't be bothered with the commitment of time and headspace   If so, who should Lola inform of her like for Fred, out of the three?      Any other thoughts…      Thank you

But i see him in a awkward way. He tells me how much he cares for me all the time, he gets jealous when i hang around with another friend that is close to me and gets mad at me for it when all we are doing is hanging out he gets jealous if i talk or hang out with my other friend more than him, he tells me in text messages every time that he loves me when he has to go or when he goes to sleep he wrote me a poem that he loves me but not in a he likes me way its written like sort of a friend way but says i love u in it everywhere and if i fall asleep with no blanket he will cover me up if i start drinking and he thinks im drunk he will talk so many things about me and how he tells his friends about me and he asked me for a hug on a message last time because he said that we have not given eachother a hug and we are really good friends best friends but that he never hugs me because hes to scared also he always likes to offer me some of his drink or his food and always tells my other friends that if this happened he would do this or that for me and that i always come first... my question is,if my best friend is normal or is that being not normal (gay) cuz i am really confused and i wouldnt like to judge him so idk what to think.

20090310004912AAlFtqE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it alright to have a guys as friends?	you see, i hang out with guys. well kind of. i have a best friend called Rebecca and we like to play this game called buildups with boys. its kinda like a chasing game. the girls at my school find the game weird and too freaky to play with boys. but i like having guyfriends. they're really nice and they come up with weird clever ideas that girls never thought of. i get along with most guys and they usually enjoy having me around. some of my guyfriends tell me personal secrets and even ask for my advice cause they trust me. three of the guys are actually quite close (but not as in family friends). me and Rebecca don't think that boys are dumb or stupid.    we are still buddies with girls at school. they dont mind that we hang out with boys but they just dont think that guys are good friends. they are always trying to 'release the inner girl' from inside of us. i like having guys as friends. i actually find them better friends then girls (no offence!). the teachers at school want me to be a girl cause they think that im going to be a 'bad boy'. but i dont think thats gunna happen cuz im a straight-A student and ive never been in trouble.    should i accept guys as my friends or as my classmates?
20090310004918AACupkD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was this just a hook up or do you think it could mean more?	i hooked with a guy recently and it was really intense the whole time he didn't stop kissing me and touching me when i would touch him he'd move my hair back and my body stayed really close to him the whole time the farthest we went was him fingering me do you think the way we were together means anything?
20090310004935AAw9a0w	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My long term partner has foiund someone else, after everything.?	we were together 4 years, lived together, and shared our lives. My previous relationship was abusive and pretty bad, and i made sure i did not get involved with someone else for a very long time after this, until i met J.      It was love at first sight, we stayed up all night, did everything together, then my mum passed away, he flew to the other side of the world to be with me.       The relationship was very off and on, until we both decided it is time to gorw up and make something of this, so we moved in together. I bought a house in a foreign (his) country to establish our 'home'..things were hard initially as i wanted everything to be perfect, he was working very late all the time, and i hardly saw him, i was really unhappy and suffering from drepression, so i said i was not happy, he replied he would move out. I was shocked and tried to gain some control in the situation and kept asking him when...he did leave, and the night he was packing his things i said to him this is not what i want but to work things out. He would not tell me where he was going or anything. A week later i met with him and asked him again to come home and work this out. He said he see's no future and that we are not compatible, but he still loves me.      I was going away for a month and thought the break and time apart would do us good.       I have spoken to him once since i have been away and it was a nice conversation, so i thought, but just today i have found out he has spent the weekend with another woman!      I am heart broken. We still have financial affiars to sort out, but knowing him he wont even care.      I want him back desperatly, i am not sure if this person means a thing to him and how he could even do this?      any advice?

20090310005341AA0fMpC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Going to court with no papers?	My friend was caught shoplifting and there's a possibility that she might have to go to court. The problem is she has no legal papers at all meaning no Social Security and whatnot. Is there anything she can do to avoid court? or can she do other things instead of the worst case scenario...getting deported? She's a good student and still wants to continue her education...
20090310005546AAvb4YN	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I tell my Friend?	Alright, Theres this girl  who has been recently spending a lot of time at my house with my Mother, since they used to work togethor and dont now.  I was just recently introduced to her not that long ago but it seemed like we clicked due to the fact that she stayed at my house into the early morning chit chatting with me and it was completely fun.  We laughed about everything and had so much in common. There was defintely what I would consider chemistry. But IDK if im her type or anything.  The problem is she's hanging around my MoM looking for a relationship, which she believes she can help her with by introducing her to people She and I know (Not my idea!!!).  My MoM mentioned it to me that she should hook up with my best friend even though I would kind of like to get to know her more and see what could happen. She's mentioned this to him and he was all for it since he recently just came out of a relationship.  The thing is I'm going into the Air Force in several months and I don't even know if it could work out.  Do I selfishly tell my friend  to back down to save myself the pain of not knowing what-could-of-been or stand by and regret it?  Is it fair to her to mention this possibly causing somethign bigger when I'm leaving in such a short amount of time?  IDK what to do.  It would be selfish to say a long distance relationship could work but I don't want another regret among the many I have.

I have spent endless money helping him out.  And the other day I spent $600 on him helping him with his car.  But when I ask him does he love me.  He doesn't say anything but thank you.  He says it out the blue sometimes.  But when I say it, he never says it in return.  I just don't want him to leave me because I love him so much with all my heart and soul.  Is this an indicator that he might leave me in the future?  Because sometimes he just acts like he doesn't care about anything sometimes?

20090310012331AAZGwPt	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is she doing this?	A girl that moved here for a year from Belgium came to be my best friend. From the moment she arrived here I talked to here, and for the whole time she lived here we were best friends, I would like to say I still consider her my Best friend..but something happened.   even though we made plans for me to go see her,  she never calls, we talked on the first of every month after she left, and now we havent spoken since november. I left her a message on FB about how my bitrthday was and updating her on my life, and that was 3 weeks ago, and she has been doing other stuff on FB, but not respondnig to me. She left in July, so has been gone for 8 months...Why do you think this is? do you think maybe we arent friends anymore or she is just busy, or maybe she will realize she is making a mistake...please, this is so confusing to me!
20090227112949AAXldM4	Family & Relationships;Family	Teenage stepkids....?	I have 6 stepkids and some issues with all of them.  When I got with my husband of 9 yrs I knew them and we had custody of all of them.  They ranged at the time from 2-13yrs.  His ex lied and won custody and got section 8.  We still saw them every chance we could.  His ex told us we could bring a pumpkin to carve outside with them and when we did she wouldn't let them come out and had him arrested.  I had to get our caller ID and prove that she called us the night before at 11p.  and she never even got a slap on the wrist.  This went on for years.  She got sick of the oldest and put him in placement so we got him out and kept him with us.  He had a full time job by then and when he went to her house for vacation he never came back and quit his job and after all this has 2 kids and no job.  The second oldest yelled at her so she put him in placement and we got him and he was a straight a and b student, but once again went with her and dropped out and has 2 kids also.  Then she moved to mass and when we found out we kept in touch with the kids.  All this time she had been collecting child support from us for all 6 and didn't even have them.  She then had Mass and NH collecting support from us for the same 6 kids so we had to pay both states every week.  I finally proved she was collecting in 2 states and once again she got away with it.  She moved to NH with a guy who had 2 kids and left hers down in Mass so after weeks of taking notes and calling the 2 states on her we finally just told her we were going to get them and moving them with us. I had been using my own check to bring them food because the house we were in was to small to fit them all. She then called and said I am taking the 2 girls to NH and if you want the 2 boys you can have them.  Of course we took them.  We made her sign papers to not collect any child support because the 2 oldest were gone and the younger ones were split.  She still tried.  She never even talked to them until they called her 8 months later and then only let them visit just recently.  She got a new boyfriend and they got to stay over this past vacation and now she is on some high horse.  The oldest she has just smashed her mom's ex's car all up and had the cops called on her and the youngest stays at her grams because mom is never home.  The 2 that live here think life blows because we have rules.  Their only chores are one does the rubbish and one does the dishes.  I raise my kids to have respect and behave and they go around telling everyone that they want to move out and live with mom.  Needless to say she has moved 5 different guys into her girls lives in 9 yrs and dated neighbors and the youngest with her is only 11yrs..  I want to go away, but it is not fair to my husband because he tries to teach them respect, but they don't have any.  Oh and the oldest one that went with her just recently got out of jail and she never even went to see him.  I did.  I even watch his kids now weekly.  How do you live with disrespectful teenagers when they just want to live the life of their mother is living?  She has only had a job for the past 4 yrs and she is almost 40.
20090227120049AAnwNpW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my ex husband do this?	My exhusband and I divorced last year. We kept seeing each other off and on but also tried dating other people. I stayed in love with him and was very hopeful that we could work it out but his heart just wasnt there. We were married for 4 years, had a baby girl and financial problems set in making us fall out of love and become very bitter toward each other. We always were fighting and he never was home. He finaly just told me he wanted a divorce. In his mind, he thinks he had no part in anything that I just didnt have respect for him. I own my mistakes and I begged to try to work it out even after the divorce was final.He is a very depressed person and really doesnt know what he wants out of life. Well now he has this young 21 year old girlfriend. We are only 28 but I got very jealous and hurt when I found out he was with her and made the mistake of telling him I was devistated he was with her. She is so unattractive ( And yes, I know its not all about looks) but he still texts me and asks things like " how are you? I dont want you to be sad cause your the mother of my child." and "I worry about you a lot" and he reasures me he wont have the new girl around our daughter for a while. Its like he wants to string me along but at the same time Im wondering if he really is just confused and is using this young girl to fill a void of his own depression. Why does he continue to text me and make sure Im ok? Ive begged to work things out and he says if we are meant to be together again then one day it will happen that he just needs to be with someone else for a while and try something differant. My biggest mistake through all of this was that I kept sleeping with him knowing he was just using me. Im just so sad and I dont know how to make the pain and jealousy just disapear. You cant just snap your fingers and it be gone. How do I try to start making it better?

Reason being, he is a very good husband, good father and good son to his parents.My only problem , which is making me psycologically ill now , is , he gets drunk every night. It is now taking a toll on his health also. He is suffering from high B.P. and B.P. medications are affecting our sex life very badly. I have tried my best to convince him but he refuses to listen to anything pertaining to his drinks. Otherwise in the day time he is very sober and caring husband. But sometimes I am so mentally disturbed by all this that it leads to bigger fights between us. I love him very much and he also looks after us very well. I am depressed all the time and can not find any solution to my problem.

20090310020538AAeq3jS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm feeling paranoid about virginity...in need of encouraging words please?	I'm in my 20's and just those "good girl" types. I've got a laid back attitude, can almost get along w. everybody, and fun to be around. I'm a modern, classy lady w. values who respects herself. I'm not like other girls my age (who I think are way too dramatic, jump to conclusions, are super judgemental and so narrow-minded)- i really try and stay away from that. I'm a picky girl yet I wouldn't mind being friends w. guys - they just need to respect me and I'm not one to like being hit on...I'm not an easy girl....and I'm also a virgin...by choice. I've had oppurtunities in the past but it just never felt "right" at that moment w. that special person...not yet. Guys react to it weird. I don't come out and say it but overtime, when it eventually becomes of topic...they either really like it (and want me to lose it) or they "respect it" but deep down inside they freak out.      Anyhoo, my cousin (we're cool but not super close) was trying to set me up w. one of her good friends. Here's the thing: you know when before meeting someone you get the "goods" on what they're like? YEAH, she told him I was a virgin. :( i'm not ashamed but I felt disrespected b/c it was not HER place to tell HIM something like that about me...whether she knew it or not or if it is fact or fiction, my virginity is not a random stat on the back of a basketball card you share to "know" someone. (Am i right?) I feel that once someone knows that piece of information about you, it takes away EVERYTHING and no one really gets to look at you fairly...some can get egos fr. it or become judgemental. Girls will look "down" at you saying it's "sweet" and they're "respectful" but you know their egos went up by 100 thinkin they know "so much more" and i know so little. Guys may be like this in way also.       It never worked w. the guy (which is fine...nothing to be heartbroken about)....but I felt that b/c of that info, it was ALL he ever talked about or would bring up. Not sure if it was b/c he was insecure about his own self (he's def NOT a virgin) but...I felt that him being a guy knowing that info killed it.    I feel so paranoid now that it's just a "random stat" to people. "yeah, she's a virgin, she's special" like it's some sort of "record breaking stats for kobe"...

Hey, Ive known this girl for about 3 months now, and last saturday night I asked her out - and when i asked she said nooo 'not like a rejection but a regret' so we talked after that which was cool, then i got home and we were on msn and we started talking, and she said she always screws up relationships with boyfriends and is horrible at dating...so i asked her 'do you love me, thats the main question' and she said yes, so i told her to think about whether she wants to go out with me.      so last night we went to coldplay together (BTW its incredible, go see it!!!) and the whole night i was just behind her with my arms wrapped around her wasit, and she was holding on. I am gonna call her tonight because im sure she feels the same way...I just need some girls opinions on how they would feel, also i know girls won't usually talk about the topic unless someone brings it up for them. should i do it over phone or msn?
20090310020415AA7FC9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is his problem? why is he acting like this?	So I met this one guy through a friend while I was struggling with my ex and he was exactly what I needed.   He was kind, nice, and sweet and I naturally started to like him. He was also having problems with his ex but he admitted that he had feelings for me anyway.   we didnt go out, we just messed around, but we both were still into our ex's and I guess we got together to relieve the pain.   I ended up really really liking him, but he told me that he was in love with his ex still.   He was my best friend, I mean, as much as I wanted to be with him he wasent in love with me and I respected that and I wanted him to be happy even if it was not with me.   we both agreed that we would "tell eatchother" everything, about how we feel with eatchother and if we wanted to end it.   And then like 3 months go by, i dont get calls, texts,  or anything. And then I find out hes going back out with his ex.      Which was fine, I just wish he told me instead of leaving me hangging so I wouldent have to look at my phone every 5 seconds waiting for him to call. But I got over it and moved on and started dating this other guy. but it ended quickly,      So a few days ago I see him again for the first time in 5 months and im smiling and being all nice and he ends up being so MEAN to me!   He acts so immaturely and I cant understand why!      I mean, I didnt confront him about going back to his ex, I gave him space and everything! and I didnt bother him at all.   So I cant really understand why hes acting this way. I didnt do anything to him. He pretty much stopped our lil "relationship" and I just let it go.

My dad lives in the United States, We live in Australia, he says he can't send us money because he's poor, turns out he lied, and spent all the money, (200,000) on selling/buying drugs.      I've been failing in school terribly, and I really can't concentrate anymore. I haven't seen my Dad for 7 years, and I expected him to be an actual father. Now it's not working out so well, and we're struggling to keep up financial-wise.        since my Mum is working 13 hours a day, for 7 days.   Plus the economy rate in Australia.

My partner doesn't reply to my emails anymore or answer his phone to me or even call me up anymore.  And if I want to see him, I have to always go to him, He never comes to see me.   I think it must be his way of telling me to move on.  Am I right?  Should I just not call him anymore or contact him at all?   and wait to see if he ever does contact me.  or would that be stupid?

20090310023611AAyzu4l	Family & Relationships;Friends	DID I DO THE RIGHT THING BY EMAILING HIM THIS?	HI, was talking to this guy for a whle, went on a date. went awesome..he called me the next day, and he emailed me today. but he didn't write back to my emails. He is such a good lucking guy , he's got a milion girls on his myspace...his ex was not very pretty and I believe him when he tells me "I've been on his mind". I just have a feeling he is dating other people...I know we've only gone out on one date but I don't want to date multiple people... so, I sent him this email...Did I do good or bad?   READ MY EAMIL:         "What's up? I can't sleep...it happens sometimes.   Well, I have a question to ask you because I like to know things up front.   I see that you read the email I sent u on myspace, I sent you two other messages today..you say you really like me...but it's feeling like a game.   I haven't dated in forever, all I know is I don't want to be someone's "date" for a day of the week or whatever while this person may be dating "other" people. I believe that people know pretty soon whether or not they just want to date one person. I'm not quite sure if you just want to date one person, and you know what, that's okay.   You've met me, when you decide you just want to date one girl, maybe I'll be around. And I hope this doesn't come off as sounding pist or mean, cause I"m not at all. Just telling you how I feel.   I just hate games, if you really want to talk to someone or enjoy their company, I think courteous responses would be reasonable.   Anyways babe, if I "hear" from you (via whatever method) cool, very cool.   If I don't, I can take a hint.   xo"

I m a mom of 2 beautiful sons, 7 and 8 yr old.I always try to spend more n more time with my kids. Few days ago we 3 were playing a game at home in which each one of us had to guess a movie turn by turn, which was being enacted by any of us.My 8 yr old was enacting a movie which i had to guess,but my other son was constantly interrupting in between and trying to guess the movie. So i cupped my hand over his mouth from behind so dat he doesnt say in between,the name of the movie. It was all in fun and laughter. He started scratching my hand,but i didnt let go off my hand from his mouth till i correctly guessed the movie. Suddenly my hubby came and started scolding me for doing this. He said that i shouldnt have done that,as it might had suffocated him. We had a fight over the issue and my whole day was spoiled. I tried to explain him that it was in fun and laughter and i wasnt smothering him as i m his mom. I dont know how i should get back things to normal.
20090310014820AAdkVN6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I do if I'm not happy in my marriage?	I have been married 2 years now. When we got married it was in a rush, and we were very much pushed into it by his parents. I had just wanted to move in with him, and be engaged for a while, but when his parents found out I was moving in they freaked out. So we decided to go ahead and get married. The only problem is, is that after being married for about 2 years, I still don't feel anything more for him, than that of being a best friend. There is no sexual attraction, and most of the time he kind of gets on my nerves, like a friend who has stayed over to many nights in a row.       The thing is, is that, he is the most UN-romantic guy I have ever been with, and he doesn't put in any effort to make our relationship have any passion or excitement. I'm not very old (20) and neither is he (26), so I don't know if it should really be like this. I'm really not sure what to do, and I could just use some advice.      Thanks,   RM

20090310021111AAmUO5I	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girl next door bikinis?	I am 17 yr old lad, in the middle of last summer, I saw mum talking to the woman next door, who she has been friends with for along time. Anyway to cut story shorter, the woman went back in and few minutes later she came out and gave mum carrier bag with something in it.       Mum brought the bag in and then put in old chest of drawers under stairs in our house.   Little while later mum went out and I looked in bag, and I found that it contained woman’s daughter who was 15 at the time 5 bikinis that I had seen her wearing.      I told girl about it and since then we have been seeing each other and I have been taking bikinis whichever one she wanted out of house so she could wear at local pool.      But now there is a problem because she wants to go swimming Thursday and when I went to get the bikini I saw.      All 5 bikinis have these triangle tops and the strings that hold them together are missing, 2 bikinis have side tying pants that had strings that could be pulled out they are also gone.   The other 3 bikinis the bottoms have the legs sewed closed.      I think mum has found out about it and put stop to me helping girl to wear the bikinis. Do you think I am right about this and what do you think in general about it.

20090310021919AAP7JCu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i decide if this decision of breaking up is right or wrong? My mind and heart is playing tricks on me?	Hello every one, what you are about to read is a true story of my life and it has left ,e between the devil and the blue sea, I was in a relationship for almost two years, My girl friend moved to Alberta for university and i lived in toronto. There is no doubt about the fact that we loved each other. Few weeks ago we had a misunderstanding and i was very annoyed with her and decided not to talk to her for somedays to make her understand the importance of me, so i decided to ignore her calls for three days( which at this point of time was our only mode of communication), she thaught that i have broken up with her and she got very upset, she called me numerous number of times for two days to which i gave no reply, out of frustration( or madness we can say) she complained against me to the police which jeopardise everything for me, my job, my career at this point of time and even my relationship with her...   Though my situation hopefuly will become normal, the fact that she did this to me( which is serious because how could you complain a file to police about some1 whom u really loved specially in a country like Canada where you can be really in trouble) just because he ignored you for three days and made u feel like he will break up with you.....      I understand that whatever she did was out of anger but my big question is   1)" should i accept her back in life because i know she loves me?"   2) The moment i think if this my heart tells me what if she does it in future and what if things get worse legally??   3) I dont know what she did can be forgiven, sometimes it feels love sometimes it feels madness and childish   4) what should i do, should i accept her back and take this risk of being with her, we dont know if she may or maynot do this again   5) or should i let her go because a person ca never change and its just not a game , its a matter of life      I know she is broken and i know she realises that she made a big mistake of her life...but should she be forgiven or should i let her go so that she learns a lesson for her own good and never does it again to anyone else knowing that she lost me whom she loved so mmuch and who loved her equally      Does this love needs to be sacrifised for two peoples better future??
20090310022001AAPMnYU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing girl - What can I Do =(?	Sorry for repost =(   I just want a decent answer       Basically I've known this girl for about a year, just chatting on msn and stuff, occasionally saying hi and talking. But December we started hanging out a few times as friends, I've hung out at her place 3 times and we talked, baked stuff and flirted alot with each other. I was sooo sure she liked me because of her flirting and wanting to hangout with me all the time, so I tried to ask her out before I left the third time, she wouldn't listen and said she was late for work and had to go, I promised myself that I'd ask her out that day, and i'd get mad at myself if I didnt. So i emailed her and told her how I felt (I wish i didnt now, I just had to tell her), so after reading it, she sent an email back over a week later (wtf) and said she didnt want to ruin our friendship because she fails at relationships and i sent one back saying that i dont think we can be friends because i'll always like her more than that, she got offended (again, i wish she let me tell her in person) and said that she got mad because i said we couldn't be friends.      I mean she's the most perfect girl to me, we had so much in common and we both made each other laugh so much. I've never felt this way about a girl before      I told her i guess we could be friends, I was just upset we couldnt be anything more and I missed hanging out with her, but she hasn't replied, I know its lame messaging, and i feel silly doing it but it was the only way at the time. I think i've absolutely blown it now and i'm really depressed and still like her, is there anyway I can say/do to redeem myself =(
