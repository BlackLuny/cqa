I have one English Budgie in a cage with four parakeets and I'm getting him a mate of his own kind because he seems left out. He is very quiet and shy. My question is, in this case is it, opposites attract, or should I get one for him that is like himself? And yes, I have read all about how to properly introduce new birds to existing birds. Thanks.
20090219225557AAnWTvJ	Pets;Dogs	My 5yr old staffy has become very aggressive.?	She had her first litter of pups the day my partner moved out, and since then has become very aggressive, with males in particular. She will try to bite any male who comes anywhere near her, or me. We kept one of her pups, and she is turning on him.      Its very unpredictable, she can be playing, then she bails him up and bites him. The latest attack required a visit to the vet. She's always been a good dog, and this is starting to worry me as i have two young children.      Have her booked in to be de-sexed in 1 week, what is the best way to combat her bitchiness? Don't want to lose her, but can't keep her like this.

20090219231722AAmRApH	Pets;Dogs	Dog growling in vets office? Please read full explanation first?	I used to have a mixed breed dog. Beautiful, healthy, and relatively young. Sadly, my mom didn't want to "deal" with him anymore and brought him to a shelter when he was about 2, I was 15 at the time.      My question is, how do you get a dog to not be aggressive towards the vet? I understand socializing, and the fact that it's the vets office and they know what it means to be there. But he had to have a muzzle put on, for safety reasons obviously, just in case he did try to bite. Even though he is no longer my pet, I would like to know this for the future.       Also, I've trained dogs before, on jumping, leash/non leash handling, potty training, and a few other things. So training is nothing new to me, I just want to know a good way to approach this type of behavior.
20090219231256AA0eP4m	Pets;Fish	I need help with bettas!?	I got this response:       Betta fish are the easiest fish to take care of! You can skip the whole filtration thing, you dont even need to regualte water temperature. "Wild" Bettas live in dirty swamp water, their a bit indistructible!!   Since i dont know the details of the project i cant go into to many details myself. BUT if thats an acceptable topic then all you have to do is get either a little tank, or a goldfish bowl for like $10 at any pet store, one male beta, one female beta and some beta food. Beleive me the male will take care of the rest, there will be babies in no time lol       How viable is this information?
20090219230631AAEfclQ	Pets;Dogs	I don't know whats wrong with my dog? Vets please?	Last night my Maltese was throwing up. He threw up about five times. And each time it was a white foamy liquid. I was planning to take him to the vet but he showed improvement almost immediately after the last time and started acting like his normal self. He has been passing very smelly gas. He is still eating and going to the bathroom normally. I think he may have gotten a hold of something he wasn't supposed to have on a walk (we live in a very large yard and he got out of my sight momentarily. I'm very careful about watching him when we walk.

20090219233848AArzzbp	Pets;Dogs	My dog is sick? Would it be wise to take him in?	Last night, my dog threw up, and the amount he threw up was incredibly large. It was just about the size of an adult making a "0" with both hands.. He also threw up once again that night, which was also large, but not nearly as much as the previous one.      It kind of looked like it contained poop, but I wasn't quite sure.. I tried not to look as I cleaned it, because it was disgusting. And today, he threw up again and when I let him outside he had diarrhea.       So, would this be something you would think he would get over without treatment? He doesn't act sick, and he still has an appetite.. Should I let it go, or take him in to a vet?

So I leashed him up and sprayed him down with Frontline Plus from head to tail. Instead of stopping the itching and biting, it seems to have encouraged it. Right away when I put him in his crate to dry off, he starts going nuts. He starts rubbing himself on his bed and against the bars like a mad man with a bad itch. I thought it was supposed to not make him itch. What's the deal with that?

20090220003634AAVgPH2	Pets;Dogs	Pregnant stray and stillborn...?	We've been feeding a stray female dog for the last week or so. She was really underweight (still is)... to the point that we didn't know she was pregnant. She gave birth sometime during the night to only one puppy that we know of. When we went out this morning she was carrying the pup around, cleaning it, and crying. We looked for other pups around our house and never found any. Surely she wouldn't leave the rest of the litter to handle the stillborn, right? Is there a possibility that she could have more? I hate to say this, but she's not our dog and we are not financially able to take her to a vet. Any advice would be appreciated.

I was just wondering what I do in that situation if he can't get it out. He went right back to picking at the rocks after he dislodged that one. I also think he cut himself getting it out. What can I do about that???      He's a shubunkin and has a pretty large mouth.
20061116160359AAsa3qg	Pets;Dogs	What is your take on off-leash dog parks? Good, Bad, Indifferent?	The trainer I admire most ( http://www.leerburg.com)  is completely and totally against off-leash dog parks.  He says it's not a matter of if some dogs will fight, but WHEN they'll fight.  My girls are small dogs (chi/italian greyhound and jrt/westie).  Most parks have special areas for the small dogs, but without someone regulating whether or not each pet is licensed, fully vaccinated, spay or neutered, I just don't think I could let my girls participate.       What do you think?  What has been your experience?

20070415201424AAVPD69	Pets;Dogs	Se puede dar bactrim a un cachorro?	Mi hijo compro un cachorro cruza de maltes de aproximadamente 1 mes, ayer lo llevó al veterinario, porque se sentia en el pecho al respirar,  como si tuviera liquido o flemas, mi hijo me dice que el veterinario le diagnosticó gripa y le recetó 2ml de bactrim 40mg-200mg/5ml cada 6 horas.  No se nada de perros pero se me hace muy fuerte la dosis para un perro tan chiquito, hoy lo estoy cuidando yo para asegurarme que el perro se pueda recuperar, lo veo mejor ya no se siente tanto ruido en su pecho, pero empezó con diarrea hace unas horas, creo que pudiera ser el bactrim, no se si seguirselo dando, bajar la dosis o suspenderlo mientras consigo a otro veterinario ma?ana. Por ahora lo estoy alimentando con leche especial marca Hartz.

One minute she'll be a loving dog, and the next she'll turn around and try to take your fingers off.

This is just a small example of this weird behavior!!  Please tell me what to do to correct this behavior.  I am scared that she might bite someone.

I recietly bought a tennesse walking horse, and she is real mellow and laid back till you put a saddle on her then all she wants to do is GO!!! I have messed with her a little and have come to the conclusion that she was used mainly as a gaming horse. She wants to run all the time, I dont want her to run all the time, but to keep her at a walk I have to constantlly keep tension on the reins, or constantlly check her, if I give her her head she picks up speed. Whats the best way to get to her to slow down and stay slow untill I want her to run, is constantlly checking her the only way, and what are my chances of slowing her down anyway, am I fighting a losing battle?

20070104082905AAN8KTw	Pets;Dogs	Hip Displaysia ?'s?	Sirius is a year old.  From the time we brought him home at four weeks, he has had hip problems.  My husband bought him for my birthday and when we noticed it, he offered to take him back and get me another dog.  I declined.      From the time he has been 3 months old, he sometimes is in such pain that he collapses and refuses to move for hours.  The Vet said that he will do some more X-rays on him and that for now I need to be thinking about surgery or the possibility of putting him to sleep when he gets a few years older.      To me, this is an extreme measure, and an expensive one.      He is a Labrador, and weighs around 63 pounds.      Anyone know of anything to ease his pain and make his life a little more comfortable?      Thanks

My neighbor's cat is in labor, and has two blood bubbles that aren't completly out yet, but we are uncertain as to weather it is the kitten in the sac? or if it is placenta? Or what!

One thing I had noticed is the owners had given him straight alfalfa which I understand can cause kidney stones in horses.  I had gotten the feeling this horse was quite depressed.  His breathe stank really bad.  I hadn't smelled a horse's breath that stunk that bad before.  When I went to walk him so the people I was with could watch to see if he was lame, he did not want to walk.  He was very resistent.  Most horses like to walk.  But not this one.      Would kidney stones cause this kind of lethargy and the sense of depression that I got off him?
20070726015629AAmM4wD	Pets;Dogs	Did my dog just sleep walk?	I have a tree-walker coon hound and he is the sweetest, nicest dog anyone could ask for. Sometimes he barks and growls, but I'm pretty sure he would never bite someone unless he was really threatened.      My friend is spending the night and we went to get something to eat out in the kitchen. My dog sleeps in my parents room, so I doubted he could hear us, and it didn't come to mind because he never does anyway.      Well, we were talking in the kitchen and I hear his coller after he stretched, so I called him. He came in the room making a strange face and strange noises. He was doing strange body movements as well kind of as if he were having a seizure(might I add, that he has had seizures, but he was calm during them, so i doubt this is what it was). He kinda showed his teeth and his nose wrinkled, as he made wierd noises, almost like a growl, but more like a moan. He kept following us, trailing back and forth, and even I was freaked out.

Es un tópico de las películas norteamericanas para adolescentes la clase de Biología en la que los estudiantes, armados con un bisturí, tienen que diseccionar una rana. La experiencia, que habrá sido traumática para más de uno, puede que pronto pase a la historia de los tormentos del sistema educativo gracias a una nueva rana, cuya principal característica es la de ser transparente.       El animal ha sido dise?ado por científicos japoneses de la Universidad de Hiroshima, con el propósito de que los alumnos de educación secundaria no tengan necesidad de diseccionar animales para descubrir el funcionamiento de sus órganos. Masayuki Sumida, un profesor del Instituto de Biologia Anfibia de dicha universidad, se?aló que en la nueva rana "puedes ver los órganos en funcionamiento", según se?aló a National Geographic.

Quisiera saber ?qué podemos hacer para evitar la crueeldad en contra de los animalitos? ?Por qué hay gente que cree que los animales no sienten, que no valen nada sus vidas, cuando en realidad sienten el mismo dolor que un humano? ?Hay alguna ley que los proteja? ?Es que no tienen derecho a vivir? Ayer me pasó algo muy feo. Estaba caminando por la calle cuando veo que un tipo viene muy rápido en su moto, en eso un perrito estaba cruzando la calle. El perrito se asustó al ver la moto que se acercaba y se quedó inmóvil. Yo le grité a ese tipo que se detuviera. No me hizo caso y atropelló al perrito. Como castigo divino el tipo perdió el control y se cayó lastimándose una pierna. El accidente pudo evitarse, pero lo que más coraje me dió es que otro viejo quería matar al perrito a pedradas, cuando el único culpable fue en que manejaba. Yo lo evité pero el perrito no tenía remedio y una inyección le fue puesta por un vet. Que gente tan mala, no es justo. Gracias por escuchar.

I have bought everything I will need apart from a cage because I'm not 100% sure on how big he will be, and I don't have a bed yet for the same reason. There's no food yet because we're going to ask the people at the shelter what he eats so its not everything changing all at once for him. We will also take his toys from there if we're allowed, but if not, we can buy some once we have him home. We know which vet we'd go through, and we have most of the things we need. But I've never had a dog before, and I was wondering if anyone has tips and advice on how I could bring him home and get him settled in. We own a cat, so we think we will bring him in on the lead, let him sniff about and then introduce him to the cat. After that, I'm a little unsure. I know the shelter staff will tell us a bit more, but I want to be 120% prepared. So anything is appreciated! Thanks

I've spoke with vet and she is ok but in diet of chicken and rice for now. however once symptoms stop I would like to try her on a food that is good for her senstive little stomach (not too rich) and preferably a compelte dry food. I wold rather she has a proper puppy food as it meets all her nutrients however a diet of chciken and rice will not meet all requirements. Vet has advised Science Plan like MOST uk vets however any one who has a dog and tried it knows dogs do not like it its veryexpensive and I know will be too rich for her.       If any one knows any foods that is easy puppy, dry complete, not too rich/sensitive stomachs. I would be grateful. I know alot of places don't sell certain foods so many if any one knows a decent food brand and a repitable website I cna buy form if not avalaible locally?       THANK YOU!

20081011194157AAeqjRs	Pets;Horses	I am entering a horse costume contest!?	I am going to dress my black 10 year old Quarter horse up as a "Slumber Pony". I am going to put a purple halter and saddle pad on her. I am then going to paint her hoofs with hoof glitter and put glitter on her mane, tail, and coat. I am then going to put purple curlers in her mane, tail, and furlock. I am then going to paint a purple star on her hindquarters! Any other ideas? She is kind of insecure and jumpy sometimes though!

20081009151543AAzp4zg	Pets;Horses	Crofton (weed) Invasion!?	I have been yearning for a horse for years, but the opportunity never really arose - until now! Mum found a cow paddock across the road and the woman who owns it said we can agist there for free.      Problem is, the paddock (having been used to graze cattle for countless years) is absolutely full of crofton (lethal to horses if ingested, but also bad for their lungs if they breathe in the pollen) and bracken. I started pulling some of it out, but three bags and a few hours later, I have only managed to clear a tiny, un-noticeable strip. Mum thought perhaps just whipper-snip the entire paddock. This means, of course, that we are not actually getting rid of the weeds, just keeping them at bay.      Are there any other alternatives? I'm still trying to pull out as much crofton as I can, but there must be an easier/better way..? At this rate, it'll take weeks!

20080315000049AAqDkEz	Pets;Dogs	Girlfriend was bit by our dog...should she get a shot?	We bought the dog here in Beijing, China. We are not sure if it was vaccinated before, but we've had it for 8 weeks now. It has been totally healthy, and had almost no contact with other animals.      It bit her on the shoulder, but not any blood was drawn. The thing is, we are leaving for a trip in one day, and are supposed to be gone for a week. If she gets the post-exposure shot, we will have to cancel the trip, as it needs  multiple shots within a short period of time...I am wondering if we leave it with the vet for the week (or 10 days), if we can check the dog for any signs of rabies after arriving back home, then get the post-exposure shot if necessary.

I have a wolf/husky puppy who is a little over 4 months old who cries and howls every time we put him into his kennel at night and when we tie or cage him when we need to clean the backyard.  He is fine when he is left alone and free to roam the yard.  We have tried putting treats inside his kennel, putting a clock under his pillow (non digital), and leaving a radio on for him during the night.  His crying and howling is driving everyone in my family as well as our neighbors crazy! HELP!!

He is toilet trained during the day but despite taking him for a walk around the block prior to going to bed and him emptying his bladder and bowels he still soils during the night. Because we don't see him do it I'm not sure how I am able to intervene to support him stopping the behaviour - does anyone have any sensible suggestions?

I have done a lot of work with her and she is quiet to catch, brush, rug, float, feed and muck about with but i have no idea what comes next. When should i mouth her? what should i be doing? what prep should i do from now on to get her ready for the breaker? Any advice is appreciated, i know all about the health and care side but not about the breaking and training so young, training to camp-draft and cutt yes but not this bit in between.

I put my horses back into the back pasture until I figure something out. Unfortunately the back of my property is filled with live oak trees as well and I guess my horses had eaten all of the acorns and thats why I didn't notice them before. What should I do? My barn is not built yet so I have no way of confining my horses until its sorted out, and even then, am I supposed to cut down a bunch of hundred year old trees? Most people around us have horses as well and their land is covered with live oak trees too, no one has ever mentioned the dangers of acorns to me. I just want some suggestions, please. :)
