I also watch a lot of Utube, have an MP3 player and and digital camera and would really need the laptop to be capable of handeling those accessories also.

In other words, at lower resolutions like 800 x 600 the desktop is not being enlarged to fill the maximum screen size which is 1600 x 1200. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?

20070404141642AAAnXGn	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Urgent: What does this error message mean??	I walked into my room today, and I know the cleaning people had just cleaned my room while I was out (I live in a university residence) and when I opened my laptop I found this error message:    RTHDCPL.EXE – Illegal System DLL Relocation   The system DLL user68.dll was relocated in memory.  The application will not run properly.  The relocation occurred because DLL C:\WINDOWS\ystem68\**CTRL.OCX occupied an address range reserved for Windows systems DLLs.  The vendor supplying DLL should be contacted for a new DLL.     What does this mean? And does it mean someone was messing with my laptop while I was out? Please help me, if there was a problem, it's important I report it now!! Thanks!

Phase 2:      Add some basic responses to the users guess. Let them know whether the guess is too high or too low compared to the number the computer generated      Phase 3:      Limit the user to only 5 guesses during the game. Let the user decide if they want to continue playing the game.

I was just wondering if it is true that when you are using your laptop while it is charging, it is best to remove the battery. (because I heard that if you charge your laptop with the battery in, it depletes the battery).   Is it also true that when you remove the battery while charging, then your laptop wil last longer when you are use it unplugged? (i.e the battery lasts longer when you use your laptop when there is no power outlet?)      Thanks!!

20090226120111AAKSpIk	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Actiontec Verizon FIOS Router?	I have Verizon FIOS and FIOS TV (w/HD). They put in the Optical Network Terminal and their Actiontec router. The router is, in my opinion, trash. It's only wireless G and it has very few ethernet ports.      I do have a Linksys business router w/VPN that has a 24 port ethernet switch and Wireless N. Can I just take the ethernet line out of the Actiontec router (the one between the ONT and the router) and plug it into the Linksys and everything will work just fine?       My concern is if the Actiontec router has special software in it that enables it to pull a signal from the ONT. If its just a router, I'll replace it ASAP.

20090226122059AAnha0w	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help with C++ assignment?	Okay, so I am not expecting a whole source code (although I'd like that) but I know no one would just plainly give it out so what I am asking is to at least try guiding me on this like an algorithm or something (steps, highlights, slight explanation, anything) ... coz I am unsure on how to do it(more like even start it) .  Here is the question.          Write a program that simulates a questionnair to find a roommate. You will ask the user various questions that might determine a suitable match, such as their age, gender, smoking prefernce, sleeping habits, pets, etc. Use an overoloaded function, called match, to determine if their preferences match your own. The match functions will take a string, Boolean, floating-point, or integer parameter depending on the question and return a Boolean value. The questions themselves will be contained in a function which returns a Boolean value indication whether the roommate is a match (depending on an acceptable number of matches on the questionnaire)         And yes I am a beginner.

20090226121344AAoDOa5	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What is the cheapest (reliable) PSU can i get to run a HD 4830 living in the UK?	I'm planning on upgrading my Graphics card to something like the HD4830. I'm under the impression that i'll need a new PSU. 6-8months ago when i bought this PC i was told the 8800 would be too much and my current PSU wouldn't be able to handle it so i got a 8600GTS. So now i'm on the prowl for a new PSU. What's the cheapest PSU (if linked, a link to a european retailer would be nice) that can handle a HD4830.         2GB PC5300 RAM   8600GTS   2.2Ghz E4500   160GB Hd (7200rpm)   DVD-RW (TSST Corp... Toshiba and Samsung joint venture basically)       http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...  This says the recommeneded PSU wattage with the HD4830 put in is 232watts.      The system is basically a cheap Dell Vostro mini tower 200, aimed at buisinesses. But i picked up a cheap one put in 1GB extra RAm and added the 8600GTS the rest remains untouched. CPU-Z says the mobo is made by Dell.inc, The Model it says :"0CU409" And It says chipset: "P35/G33/G31".

I want to be able to use a drop down for Column A, when I select from the drop down list, I want column B and C to auto-populate with the corresponding info.       So if I select Activity no 1, column B will populate with the appropriate spec section and column will populate with the appropriate description.      How do I do that? What formulas do I need to use in column b & c?      Also, can I do the same with the other columns? So if I select from the drop down in column b, columns a and c will populate. Or if I select from column c, I want columns a and b to populate. Is that possible? Or would that be circular?

My router, SIEMENS Gigaset SE587 WLAN dsl, does not work with Ubuntu 8.10 and Windows 7 BETA every time I turn the router on.   It works with Vista fine, Windows 7 can see the router but not connect, but Ubuntu 8.10 can not see it at all.   But when I turn the router off and on a few times, it will just suddenly work.   It is fine knowing how to get them to connect this way, but it is a problem when my sister and my computer is using the connection and I end up having to stop them just so I can try to connect, it also gets tiresome.   My laptop works fine with any other network.      Does anyone have any ideas?   I think if I change the Wireless Channel it may work as it is set to automatic at the moment, but I'm not sure.

20090225110055AAZnU89	Computers & Internet;Software	Can someone help me with my Windows ME?	Okay, I suck with computers, I'm just gonna say that now. I was deleting programs on my Windows ME since it was going so slow. One of the programs I deleted was Internet Explorer 6 and 'other components', whatever that means. When it deleted it, it told me to restart my computer, which I did. But when it was starting back up, a pop-up came up saying something about SHELL32.EXE (or something like that) had failed. I'd close that window and then all that would come up is just my desktop background. That's it. Does anyone know how (or if) I can fix my computer without having to take it in and paying to get it fixed?

Ive been getting Low Disk Space warnings a lot in the past few weeks and everytime I make more space (like 2 gigs) the space will be gone within a day or two and I'll get another warning for low disk space. I'm not downloading anything. All i really have been using my computer for recently is just listening to internet radio (slacker.com) and playing games, with the occasional lab report thrown in.   I cant find where all this lost disk space is going. I'm guessing i I must have lost 10 gigs of space somewhere by now and I cant find what is being stored or where it is.   I've done full system scans with Norton and my comp is clean.   Any suggestions for what I can do?

I think my computer is in the process of being infected or something.   Anyways, that is not that I am asking.      Okay, so my computer is "complaining" so to speak, and so I put up Norton to fix the problem.      It fixed most of the problems, but it said that the "Backup and Restore" is not protected. I keep clicking fix, but then it says this:      There is a backup problem. Make sure the destination drive or device is connected and retry.      So two questions:   -What is "backup and restore"   -What is it talking about (2nd part)

20090226130217AAKWjPO	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Is this a normal spammer trick?	I got my first spam on one of my email accounts. Normally when I get the first spam I email my friends and tell them a new email address because normally within a couple of weeks the 'odd spam' becomes an unmanageable avalanche.      This one says that my email has been collected for 'selective targeted marketing'. Under the can-spam act, I have 7 days in which I can opt out, by sending someone a $5 'admin fee' by PayPal. If I pay, they will not sell on my email address.      Obviously, spammers are criminals and won't keep their word, and there is no way I'm going to pay them, but is this a regular trick?      Is there any point reporting it to PayPal?

Right, i've recently got a new gfx card as well as a new pc to house it in but i seem to be getting "doubled up" images on my flat screen. The screen is vga and the input on my gfx card is dvi. So i got an adapter to switch from my monitor's vga cable to to fit into my gfx card's dvi. Now i have the doubling problem. Before i had my old pc and old gfx card everything looked fine but now - every time i try to do any artwork - every line doubles or even triples up to the right of it's own image. Here's the gfx card:      BFG Nvidia GeFroce9800GT Overclocked.       So my question is. Maybe my graphics card is not compatible with the monitor's vga and does that mean i need a new screen?
