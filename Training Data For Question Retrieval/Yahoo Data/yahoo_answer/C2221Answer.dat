While the Minmatar Republic is the official state, only a quarter of all Minmatars are part of it. The largest proportion, almost a third, are enslaved within the huge Amarr Empire, while a fifth resides within the Gallente Federation, creating a powerful political bloc which keeps relations between the Gallenteans and the Amarrians in a constant state of tension. The remainder, who are not part of any formal organization, live as freemen throughout the world. Many are itinerant labourers, roaming from one system to another in search for work. A fair number make their living on the darker side of the law, acting as pirates, smugglers and peddlers in all kinds of illegal goods, and many of the larger criminal groups in the world of EVE are run by Minmatars. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gold2us.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gold2us.com</a>
AA11306754	umm ok so i'm 13 so this will work out well.<br>  <br>  ok so for my 13th b-day my mom took me and my friends to boston billiards where we got to play pool, listen to music, watch tv, and eat food it was a pretty good b-day and i enjoyed it. and now its only 8 days till my b-day =]<br>  <br>  ok so for ur son's b-day i think you should have some food somewhere around there like a restuarant or just a caterer at the DJ spot, lose the magic tricks because teens aren't into it really, music: googoodolls, panic! at the disco,the fray, taking back sunday, shakira, nickelback, sean paul, 3 doors down, ciara, and matchbox20 are my favorite singers/bands and most 13 year old boys and girls like them and there on the radio alot so search them and there songs and also dance moves are eletric slide and cotton eyed joe those are what they do at the dances and if u can find more that will be great.<br>  <br>  as for games i think bowling is enough fun but maybe card games or board games like checkers or chess|`|w82ZdEqYaa	You should do like Judd Nelson's father did in the horrible 80's movie "Breakfast Club"; A carton of smokes, and a pat on the back|`|H0lXA1EYaa	maybe what u can do is ask your son what sports his friends likeand what kind of music they all like. and roll with that.

UW93e40Eaa	I had a 2.5 T-Maxx and still have a Revo 3.3. Both trucks did exactly what your talking about. Traxxas said it was normal. The more you bash-in your little fire-breather, the better it will run. Just dont blow it up!|`|XjC2VtPWaa	There can be many different things causing your starvation problem.  First off is your draw tube at the bottom of your tank.   Do you have any air leaks, around the cap, in the fuel tank, fuel line or carburetor.  Finding an air leak can be difficult.  <br>  My first guess is that you have an air leak somewhere.  Also it could be an exhaust leak, not building enough pressure in the fuel tank.  <br>  I would start off by checking the O-ring on your fuel cap.  Then are there any wet spots on the outside of your fuel tank.  At the seams.  Any cracks or holes in any fuel line.  Check your fuel filter is it plugged or cracked.  Is your carburetor loose.<br>  If I remember right Traxxas does offer a fuel tank rebuild kit.<br>  How I check for an air leak:  Remove fuel tank from chassis with all fuel lines still attached to the tank, pressure and fuel feed line.  Make sure to empty all fuel from tank.  Then I fill the fuel tank to about 3/4 full with soapy water.  Now blow into the pressure line, while plugging the fuel feed line with your finger.  Look for any bubbles in the fuel tank and any exterior bubbles.  If you see any bubbles you have an air leak.  If at 3/4 full you see no bubbles then empty your fuel tank to just below 1/2 full and repeat.  <br>  Now for the bad thing about using this method.  You need to be positvie that there is no water or soap left anywhere in your fuel system.  You will need to rinse your fuel tank with clean water to till all signs of the soap is removed.  Blow out all lines.  Now you have to be positive that all moisture is removed from your fuel tank.  Nitro fuel and engines hate water.  You can use compressed air to blow out tank or a hair dryer.  Just be positive all moisture is gone.<br>  Good luck hope this helps.|`|nfCcvA27aa	Hey there<br>   The first thing I would do is check the fuel pick up tube. Open up the fuel tank and look down in it, you will be looking on the inside of the tank where the fuel line connects on the bottom. There will be a plastic tube in there that is part of the tank. Look at that plastic tube and check it for damage. <br>  <br>  Another thing to think of is that when your engine gets up to operating temp it could be getting to hot around mid tank if the fuel tank is in good shape you might want to try to richen up your low speed needle. this is the brass one on the side of your carb. Turn it just about the width of the screwdriver tip counter clockwise. <br>  <br>  I wish I had a guranteed answer for you but as you know these engines can be difficult to tune to say the least.<br>   GOOD LUCK

9NRyeif9aa	Not sure if your talking about the Game of the real Mythology.anyways.<br>  <br>  God of War is a video game for the PlayStation 2 console released on March 22, 2005. It is an action-adventure game based on Greek mythology. God of War was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's Santa Monica division. It is the first installment of the God of War series of games and the second chronologically.<br>  <br>  It was very well received by critics and fans alike and was the recipient of many awards, including "Game of the Year" honors from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. In 2007, IGN named God of War as the greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time, on their Top 25 PS2 Games list.[1] The game is now available in the PlayStation 2's lineup of Greatest Hits. A sequel titled God of War II was released March 13, 2007. A prequel, exclusive on the PlayStation Portable, titled God of War: Chains of Olympus, was released on March 4, 2008. A third title, God of War III, is also in development for the PlayStation 3.<br>  <br>  ARES: In Greek mythology, Ares (Ancient Greek: ?ÏÎ·? [Ã¡.r?Îµs], Îodern Greek: ?ÏÎ·? ['a.ris]) is the son of Zeus and Hera. Though often referred to as the Olympian god of warfare, he is more accurately the god of bloodlust, or slaughter personified: "Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle, war|`|3b28FoTfaa	Totally Greek stuff.

LnYr2dLfaa	After you talk to the owl, continue walking up the river. Not the way to the castle, the way you met the owl. After you have reached the end you should see a big waterfall. Get up to the waterfall and stand on a small square on the ground with a picture of a Triforce. Play Zelda's Lullaby while standing on that square and the waterfall will slow down. Then jump into the waterfall and you will be in a small cave. Keep walking in and you will be in the Zora's Domain.|`|B6Jqb5jhaa	I don't remember much of the game since it's been a while, but I think you play the melody by going to some place. You go to Kakariko Village, I think, don't enter it though. Anyway, you know how on Hyrule Fields there is like a river flowing near the entrance of Kakariko? You follow it upstream and somewhere around there there's a waterfall where you play the melody. If it's your first time getting to Zora's Domain, I think that's what your supposed to do. There is another time you enter it but through another way. That's later though. Like I said, it's been a while, so sorry if I misled you or anything.|`|cJ168hg7aa	After you talk to the Owl, go all the way to the end of the river.

cgAxyyjxaa	You can download it as a torrent file from a torrent listings site. I would say that mininova is the best ( <a href="http://www.mininova.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mininova.org</a> ). But you'll have to install a peer to peer software (P2P) first, i would recommend Bittorrent ( <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittorrent.com</a> ). After it finishes downloading you'll most probably have to extract the folder using a program such as WinZip ( <a href="http://www.winzip.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.winzip.com/index.htm</a> ). If this is too confusing then you can just buy the game again. Since it's old it won't cost a lot.

Have any links to the videos that show the white cars?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Okay, I've looked at the video.  Notice how on the details, it says that it's a mod?  <br>  <br>  Post a comment or contact the maker of the video asking what mod he used to get the cop car.  Most likely it's a mod for the PC version that won't work for the PS 2, but it's worth a shot.

CM7gh05Qaa	Ps3= blu-ray player for ps3 games and blu-ray movies.Xbox= normal dvd player. The new 40 GB ps3 cant play old ps2 games and you cant put a usb stick to watch movies or music. with the Xbox you can play old xbox games and you can play movies or songs from a usb. (The games are better on the Xbox). The ps3= internet browser with online gaming. xbox= only Microsoft site to download updates, patches and xbox live to play online. <br>  <br>  By the way if you have a HDTV i think it would be more interesting to buy a ps3 because it has a blu-ray player (ps3=cheapest blu-ray player) and its got HD games.<br>  On the other hand if you own a normal TV or HD ready then get the Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  Either one you get you will have the three games available that you want.<br>  <br>  (if you get the ps3 i strongly advise you to get the 60gb or 80gb (same) because they can play ps1, ps2 games, 4 usb slots and Flash card readers)|`|WOKbYTe5aa	u shouldnt post a question like this, just gonna start a fanboy war :)<br>  <br>  the difference between the 20,60 and 80 isnt much just 80 has a bit more ports in it, the 40 is the only one that cannot play ps2 games|`|0403c31bc955220e18a117b448cd7391aa	IMHO, the PS3 will be a better buy than the Xbox360.<br>  The price of games shouldn't be an issue because most games are similarly priced for both consoles.<br>  As for online gaming, PS3 is free, while you have to pay for XboxLive. I own a PS3, but I've heard that you get your money's worth on XboxLive [whatever that means!].<br>  The PS3 60gb is no longer being produced, so the only way you can get it is used!! But it is compatible with PS2 games, has a memory card reader, more usb ports, and obviously 20gb more space.<br>  If you're not really bothered about those features, the 40gb is right for you; and no, its the same console so there's no difference in gameplay.|`|3Rk99Lqhaa	Personally I prefer the Xbox 360 although I have A ps3.<br>  the xbox 360 is more better online although it costs $50 a year ,but you do get your moneys worth.The bad point with the 360 is that the RROD situation and it needs to be solved .If your gonna get a 360 get the halo 3 edition because it has a differnet chip in it so it doesnt overheat.the games in most cases are cheaper because it will be easier to put games on dvd format than blu-ray.But if you can hold out,go for the ps3,go for 60 gb or 80gb.I have a 60gb,oh yeah and if you get a ps3 add me: FIFA_KING27.<br>  good luck m8|`|SaygONKsaa	Take ps3<br>  All ps3 games cost same much like xbox 360 games<br>  Xbox 360 online = you must pay more then 50 dollar <br>  PS3 online = free<br>  This year coming best ps3 games out.<br>  Just take ps3<br>  Xbox 360 = red ring of dead<br>  Xbox 360 games coming on pc but playstation 3 games not coming on pc<br>  Halo 3 coming on pc too

asfBo3xmaa	yes it is a good game but i never had a xbox 360 before and it is a good game of all time! (the worst part of the game was to many loading screens.) and the best part is the gameplay.<br>  <br>  if there is too many loading screens just let me know.|`|4lvJUa2Caa	I doesn't matter what your friend says.

Bringing Sonic to the 360 as next-gen wasn't a good idea, but if they did better, it might have been one great game.<br>  <br>  However, Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the X360 Arcade are awesome... (gotta love Sega Classics... :-P)<br>  <br>  GameSpot rated Sonic the Hedgehog (X360) a 4.4 / 10 (Source)|`|cznub7F7aa	well i bought sonic the hedgehog for my missus i played it and thought it was well crap.. its nothing like the sega version as its more 3d and what not now but personally i dont rate the game at all.. why dont you rent it from blockbusters or somet and give it a try.. save your self some monies if you find you dont like it .. <br>  <br>  p.s. id take it back but i never kept the reciept lol..|`|gBcrGJouaa	heres the real deal its a suckish game! on the x box

vHPXAH5Jaa	I was in the same position as you are. I'm very good at Halo but when I first started playing Call of Duty I wasn't catching on. <br>  <br>  You have to be more stealthy, It is not always a run and gun like Halo. Also you have to train yourself to see the opponents hiding because they are not wearing bright halo armor. Once you practice you'll get the hang of all the different weapons and add-ons. The game is great, you'll get it, you just have to play more.<br>  <br>  On the game there is a list of things you caunlockck and it shows you what you need to do it. Whether it's 100 kills with this gun or that gun you will start to unlock things. The red dot add-on is one of them.<br>  |`|n3D7Lccwaa	Your going to stink till you log at least 48 hours of gameplay. You need to learn the crap out of the maps, your probably running out into bad spots.|`|kdbkGMjvaa	Well, every game has a specific gun to use. <br>  <br>  Like if you see the game is close quarters(when you always encounter players 10 feet away or less), use P90.<br>  <br>  But I suggest work on M16 first, then you should complete the challenges and you will get the red dot. Then try to unlock the Perks: Double Tab and Deep Impact. When you finish, you now have a good gun, but it depends on your preferences.<br>  <br>  The AK-47 is also good, with a silencer, so is G3 with a Red Dot, it does a lot of damage (usually pull the trigger three times you can kill an opponent. <br>  <br>  And to unlock the red dot/s on the guns, you have to complete certain challenges, they require an amount of kills to be unlocked. To check them, go to Barracks, to Challenges. There you have a category of challenges that you could do, and if you completed them you will get an amount of experience points (for ranking up) or maybe if you completed them you could get a red dot, silencer, ACOG scope, but it depends on which challenges you do. Be sure to work on the right one to get the right gun part you want.<br>  <br>  Lastly, my suggestion is practice, and don't hide on exposed places, and memorize every place that the enemy usually go to, so you have an advantage. And just keep using the gun that you want (the one you where you want the red dot to go) a bit later you will have the red dot unlocked. Keep in mind that if you unlocked a silencer or a red dot on a gun, you can ONLY use that red dot or silencer on THAT gun. So choose carefully. Good luck, I hope I helped, and sorry for the long lecture.|`|G0TkeRbEaa	you just need to practice i was extremly dump but now i am a 10 prestige lv 55 Commander. Ny kill to death ratio is now 4-1 per match. and as for the red dot sight it becomes aviable on different guns at different time as you level up, you will have all the guns and the red dot sight on all of them once you unlock it on each gun, it is 25 kills per gun you need to get to unlock red dot sight make your clan tag [GCMD] |`|D1pqTFwraa	i am currently MLG in halo 3, and my clan is doing godly in cod4.<br>  try and use one gun for your class if you want red dot. look in your barracks and go to challenges and go to whatever gun you want.<br>  <br>  I dont know how i got to be good in cod4, but practice, get some really good friends, and heres a tip.<br>  when your getting shot at, this almost always works.<br>  prone.<br>  prone down for a split second and at that time you get to make a choice,<br>  shoot back or book it.<br>  <br>  thanks<br>  <br>  mike|`|U4Qz9rqDaa	you unlock it, use a gun for a while than soon BAM its yours,<br>  there is a thing by create a class, its called barraks its like achevements. |`|wpHXgO76aa	unfortunately most cod players that play hardcore or search and destroy camp in corners and pick people off which is annoying and hard to beat sometimes. you should try playing old school were everyone starts with the same gun and no perks. you pick these up as you run around, also you half life and a half, so you can't be killed by just one sniper shot. your health doesn't regenerate tho. very very good game type|`|q3nlEmhnaa	If you have time play on xbox live or any other internet service for your system that you have.

h4bfJcHoaa	Hmm, depends on what you look for in a gaming experience.<br>  First you will need to purchase the original WoW game, you can find it just about everywhere. Get your account all settled with that, and a game minutes card from any gaming/computer store really, or a subscription via credit card. Once your account is setup, you should then install Burning Crusade expansion pack, as it wont work unless you don't have the original World of Warcraft installed. Better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  As far as Teamspeak goes, unless you create your own Guild, then most guilds willing to go far in the game will have already have a server up for you to use. Ventrilo and Teamspeak are the most popular voice chat programs, and both are free to download and use, you can find them by doing a Google on either. To listen on Ventrilo (Vent) or Teamspeak (TS) all you need are headphones, speakers, any kind of audio output device. But of course, you want to be able to talk back; you'll need a microphone or headset that plugs into the pink audio jack on your sound card or motherboard, usually in the back or mid/lower front of your computer. If you want my suggestion, I HIGHLY reccomend you shell out about $25-30+ for Sennheiser headsets, mine is a Sennheiser PC-130. The audio quality is excellent, and the microphone is crystal clear. It hasn't broken/failed to work in over a year now, and it was pretty darn cheap...<br>  <br>  If you opt for a plain microphone over a headset, I would suggest you get at least some good speakers; if you want the 'full experience,' then you will want to hear this game's beautiful music score and sound effects. Even better, is the surround sound systems in a crowded Battleground. :)<br>  <br>  For accessories: Mouses are never an issue in WoW, at least not for me. If you really plan on playing WoW for a long time or have the money to spare for the full experience, search around for the World of Warcraft Z-Board. It is a keyboard designed specifically for WoW, and has several actions and keys made especially for WoW pre-installed.<br>  <br>  Now that you're actually in the game, you want to make that UI (User Interface) look pretty kicking, no? You'll want a UI that's either efficient or accommodating, to say the least. "Curse Gaming," "ui.worldofwar.net," and the official World of Warcraft forums for mods and UI are very helpful to give you the addons you want. Several addons are packaged as a whole for specific classes; you have a lot of time, play around with addons you like and find something that suits you.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you have the computer power, pump up those graphic settings! WoW can look really nice when you're maxed out.<br>  <br>  Checklist:<br>  Original World of Warcraft<br>  World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade<br>  Credit Card Subscription/Game Minutes Card<br>  Teamspeak + Ventrilo Installed<br>  Microphone or Headset<br>  Speakers (Null, if you got the Headset.)<br>  WoW Z-Board (If you opt for it.)<br>  UI Addons<br>  <br>  Have fun in Azeroth!<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|xFmHltRWaa	First and foremost you will need a computer that can handle the strain of running the game.  The graphical bumps in the B.C. expansion make this even more a point to stress.<br>  <br>  As for outside programs/addons the one program that you really should get is Ventrilo or Vent as it is called in game.  Vent is like teamspeak only it sounds much better(5.1 surround sound support) and is a little more user friendly.  Most likely if you join a large guild they will have their own Vent server for use.<br>  <br>  Addons vary by personal preference and playstyle.  Myself I use the FuBar addon package and like it very nice.  If you plan to raid at all most players will pick up a addon called CT_Raid Assist.  They main thing is your playstyle should dictate what addons you want to use, not the other way around. :)|`|7359f8888982a46d1bb48aba5b1757e6aa	teamspeak/ventrillo is good to have.  addons/mods are good too but be careful since lots of people get their account hacked that way.  if you're just getting started you don't really need very many mods.  <br>  Gatherer is a good one to have if your professions are mining or herbalism.  it keeps track of where mines or herbs spawn.<br>  swstats is a great damage/healing meter. <br>   when you start raiding, ctraid_assist is a great mod to get, deadly bossmods too.  they announce mobs abilities,etc.<br>  some specific classes have mods that are helpful for them.  my main is a priest, so i have a mod called MendWatch which keeps track of my prayer of mending.  i know warlocks and pallies also have class specific mods available but i don't know what they're called.<br>  itemrack is a good mod to get so you can change your armor quickly instead of having to find the armor in your bags.<br>  <br>  ui.worldofwar.net<br>  curse-gaming.com<br>  <br>  are the sites i get my mods from.  but please, BE CAREFUL DOWNLOADING MODS!!!!

h4bfJcHoaa	Anyone can make a guild or raid. Raids are easier to form than guilds technically, but both require lots of people.<br>  <br>  To create a guild, you must first seek a <Guild Master> NPC in a main city, i.e., Ironforge, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Undercity, Stormwind. Click the Create Guild option when talking to them, and then type in your guild's name, along with the 10 silver fee. This will give you a Guild Charter, which must have 10 signatures to get the guild created. Your signature counts as one, so you'll need 9 friends or friendly strangers to help you sign it. To get people to sign it, use it in your inventory while targeting them, it will ask to sign. Upon getting all 10, go back to the Guild Master, and hand it in. Your guild will be created with all the members you got to sign it, and you can now start managing your guild.<br>  <br>  A raid is more simple, but you need a lot more people. Become the party leader, and make an average party, any amount of people will do. Then open your Social window (O default) and then go to the Raid tab, and hit Convert to Raid. This will turn you into a raid, and you can manage your raid from that window.<br>  <br>  Its all learned along the way, trust me.<br>  <br>  As for personal experiences, just remember to treat your guild with respect. If you have loyal members, the guild will grow, and you can eventually complete raids with them and everyone will get along. Remember not to make unnecessary raids; raid groups are for the big baddies. Raids are also very unorganized without a skilled leader in my experiences, so do NOT be afraid to speak up and settle from time to time. Be a leader, and you will succeed.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|7359f8888982a46d1bb48aba5b1757e6aa	yes you can make a guild.  you have go to a major city and create a charter. if you aren't sure where to go, ask a guard and they will tell you.  you need to have 10 people to sign it in order to make a guild though.  it probably costs some gold too, but i have never created one so i'm not sure how much.  you can also make a guild tabard, but that costs gold too, i think.
RTfrzZp6aa	The reason it matters is that different races start out with different stats. NEs have one of the lowest +str of the Alliance races so there aren't too many Warriors (lots of agi though, which means lots of Rogues). <br>  As for ranged attacks, I've never played a Warrior, but I think not. A warriors job is to get all up in the action, anyway. Leave ranged for the Hunters and Casters.|`|NYfmqwl4aa	well no, not really. The elf's are good for hunters and rogues. the dwarfs are good for warriors..etc mainly cause they have different racial bonuses
xFmHltRWaa	The reason you might be getting a slow download is that yes it is a mighty huge file.  Also if you are trying to download it within the last day or so the Blizzard download servers are under strain because of the advance files for fairly large patch are being downloaded as well.  I would let it run over night or wait until after Weds or Thurs until the patch traffic slows down.|`|d1a7073040bbfb1bd6feb918b4a30c9eaa	yes cause your going normal and Burning Crusade maybe but there is ALOT of crap you have to dl first also you gota dl all the patches that have been made theres alot of them too|`|1n1d3jRNaa	World of Warcraft is actually a very large file and joined with a slow computer, the download time can be horrible. You might want to close any other open programs and mabey reset your computer. Anything that you can do to raise the computer's speed will help. If you have less than 512MB of RAM then you shouldn't even bother trying to download wow. To check this go to the control panel from the start menu and click the "system" folder. The RAM should appear under the "general" tab.|`|TQ38uaMuaa	yeah... wow takes forever to load i would get it on a flash drive from a friend|`|e5fa3064ffc8952ea4a56aeb822f8e9aaa	Yes, it's at lease 6 gigs!  You might want to just let it run overnight.|`|r4mFLQxVaa	Yes, it is a very large file. There will also be patches to donwload afterwards, but these appear automatically don't worry.<br>  <br>  Trust me though, it is a great game. Definately worth it. Just watch a DVD or something and come back to it   :)

Oder anders gesagt: Sterne szintillieren.<br>  <br>  Wie schon gesagt haengt es mit lokalen Dichteunterschieden der Luftmasse in Sternrichtung zusammen. Sterne sind fast absolut punktfoermig (im Gegensatz zu Planeten, dazu spaeter) und ihr Licht wird durch die Dichtefluktuationen mal warmer, mal kalter Luft auf dem Weg zu Deinem Auge abgelenkt, so dass sie funkelnd erscheinen. Da die verschiedenen Frequenzen des optischen Spektrums des Lichtes auch verschiedene Brechungsindizes haben kann man zuweilen auch eine Farbzerlegung beobachten. Also nicht nur, dass man Hell-Dunkel-Szintillation beobachtet, sondern auch ein farbiges Funkeln der Sterne.<br>  <br>  Je staerker die Dichteunterschiede in der Atmosphaere, desto staerker ist Turbulenz in ihr und desto staerker szintilliert es.<br>  <br>  Je tiefer ein Stern steht, desto mehr Weg muss sein Licht durch die Atmosphaere nehmen, also funkeln tiefer stehende Sterne immer staerker.<br>  <br>  Funkelt es in einer Nacht kaum, dann ist die Atmosphaere auch ruhiger ---> Wetter stabiler.<br>  <br>  Da Planeten nun aufgrund ihrer viel groesseren Naehe zur Erde eher als kleine Scheibchen erscheinen denn als Punktquellen, szintillieren sie viel weniger. Denn Dich erreicht zwar Licht von verschiedenen Punkten der "Planetenscheibe" genauso stark szintillierend wie von Punktquellen wie Sternen, aber im Mittel gleicht sich das Licht verschiedener Punkte von der Planetenscheibe aus und es erscheint Dir daher ein Planet am Himmel ruhiger.<br>  <br>  Das ist auch ein einfacher Test, ob ein fixer und heller Punkt am Himmel ein Stern oder ein Planet ist.<br>  <br>  Sterne funkeln viel staerker als Planeten. Es funkelt staerker, je tiefer die Lichtquelle sitzt.<br>  <br>  Wenn ein tief stehender Punkt daher weniger funkelt, als ein hoeher stehender Punkt, so ist der tiefer stehende Punkt logischerweise ein Planet. Denn ein tiefer stehender Stern wuerde staerker funkeln, denn ein hoeher stehender Stern.<br>  <br>  Oder anders: Meint man, dass ein Punkt ein Planet sein koennte, so sucht man sich etwas hoeher einen anderen Punkt.

vGyCsllcaa	Hey! WOW a COOL QUESTION.<br>  I ll provide u some sites.<br>  Try www.freewebs.com/pspgamefree/<br>  It's preety cool.<br>  Try Youtube.com and try on how to put NDS Games on the PSP but if u see a video with NDS CARTRIDGE on the PSP Scree it s FAKE. Try SOME VIDEOS and i have some HSM 2 NDS Games on my PSP.<br>  8GB Memory Stick is COOL.<br>  32 GB MEMORY STICK is releasing in fall 2009. It s just my ADVICE.<br>  Would u try uTorrent.<br>  Get uTorrent and go to www.mininova.org and search any game u wanna for PSP or search PSP on the search bar.<br>  Download it and then save the torrent and then open uTorrent and click File and then click add torrent and then click the torrent u saved from MININOVA.org<br>  Start Downloading.<br>  U can also pause the torrent and turn off the PC for safety. I mean u PC doesn't get heated.<br>  The site i gave u are not torrents, they re regular.<br>  If u can download it from torrents then it is also regular when u see the WinRAR archive.<br>  When u see the WinRAR archive u click the right mouse button and click WinRAR and then click extract here.<br>  Then u ll get a ISO or a CSO or a FILE.<br>  If u see a ISO file u can make it smaller by using PSP ISO COMPRESSOR. I mean the size. For example the ISO Game is 1 GB and u gan use this PSP ISO Compressor and convert and compress it to aa CSO Fileand make the size smaller.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  I know that it is long but i just gave u for u r enjoyment.<br>  Thx.<br>  Rate my answer.|`|mMy1xzAEaa	Go to  www.psp-hacks.com<br>  all games,software's,home brews,etc<br>  Have FUN|`|GS0qqawqaa	If you have a modified psp (that means you have Custom Firmware), then you're bound to experience the full potential of you're console.<br>  Basically, you can download and play games with or without UMDs, watch movies with or without UMDs, play some music, and connect to the internet via Wi-Fi. Also, you can customize your PSP by placing some themes. The normal themes are called PTF themes while the best and a bit complex themes are the CTF themes. They are flash themes so expect that they will give your PSP a very unique look and interface. Homebrews are also available. Example if your fund of reading, there is a homebrew that allows you to read ebooks in your PSP and other cool stuffs. There are emulators as well for the PSP so that means, you can put other consoles' games. Goodluck and have fun,

If people want to use them and not get the full experience of the game, that's their choice, or if you feel it gives them an unfair advantage, go out and buy one yourself. I personally only use AR if I've beat the game already.|`|e0a0cbbc825163333f34eeb377475ae0aa	Well you can't say that cheats are THAT bad.

But cheating online sucks and ruins the fun for other people.|`|FYYsTtZ3aa	well action replay is okay because it doesn't glitch your game but if you use ANY  to beat a game your a dirty cheater.

Im allgemeinen Sprachgebrauch bezeichnet Sex sexuelle Handlungen zwischen zwei oder mehr Sexualpartnern, insbesondere den Geschlechtsverkehr und vergleichbare Sexualpraktiken, in seltenen F?llen auch die Masturbation.<br>  <br>  Sex erfÃ¼llt zahlreiche verschiedene Funktionen: Er befriedigt die Libido, dient in Form des Geschlechtsverkehrs der Fortpflanzung und drÃ¼ckt als wichtige Form der sozialen Interaktion GefÃ¼hle der Z?rtlichkeit, Zuneigung und Liebe aus. Besonders in Liebesbeziehungen kann das Sexualleben eine zentrale Rolle als Ausdruck der Verbundenheit der Partner spielen.<br>  <br>  Sexuelle Handlungen unterliegen dem sexuellen Selbstbestimmungsrecht. Die Strafbarkeit bestimmter Praktiken dient heute weitgehend dem Schutz dieses Rechtsguts.<br>  <br>  Sexueller Kontakt unter Tieren wird fÃ¼r gew?hnlich Begattung genannt. In der Regel handelt es sich dort um rein instinktgesteuertes Verhalten, das ausschlie?lich der Fortpflanzung dient. Bei einer Reihe von Arten, etwa den Bonobos und Delfinen, ist der Sex ?hnlich wie beim Menschen auch Teil der sozialen Interaktion.

The people we bought the debt card from misspelled my husband's name, and it took us forever to figure it out. ( X-Box live wouldnt take the account until we got it right). Thats the only way we got ours to work.  A few weeks later our X-Box quit working and we had to trade it in for a new one. This is the second time we've had to deal with the same thing.

BndTpGDXaa	By the reviews and information i was looking on it, it looks like a awsome game because not only you have the guitar like in guitar heros you get to have a drum set and a mic to play with your friends. I think it is going to be better then guitar heros i cant wait till it comes out.|`|CGfF8nvDaa	It looks amazing, but I think the vocals might mess it up. In the demo at E3 the vocals were awful and the mic didn't pick up well. The drums will be great though. Guitar Hero is rumored to be coming out with more instruments for the wii. Plus after Guitar Hero got big they copywrote "Drum Hero" and "Keyboard Hero" so more instruments will probably be soon in that series as well. Guitar Hero will always be good because they are the ones who started it all.|`|daa2e634fd4348c290fd13540ea067d6aa	Both are going to rock. I'd take Rock band because it has drums

If you brought it, then you don't have to pay for anything. But you would need a computer to connect to.
BndTpGDXaa	I dont think it is ever comming out for the virtual console because it was made by Rare which is no longer part of nintendo but is now part of Microsoft so i think if they release it for the vitual console it would raise copy right problems and they would like avoid that so they wont release it for virtual console but the only way for you to play it is on the nintendo 64.|`|AA11612795	Ashley is right.  Since Rare, the developer of DK64 was bought by microsoft, it will be extremely difficult for nintendo to get the rights to the program.  It would take some serious cooperation between two bitter rivals to get that game out.|`|AA11688416	IDK|`|LIMrTtjQaa	Donkey Kong Country was released on the Virtual Console with no legal problems with Microsoft, so Donkey Kong 64 should not be a problem.  This is because Nintendo owns the rights to its characters and can distribute their games regardless of any second-party developer involvment.  However, a game such as Banjo-Kazooie or Conker's Bad Fur Day in which Rare itself owns the rights, Nintendo could not release on Virtual Console without Microsoft's consent (and it would be very unlikely Microsoft would give Nintendo the rights).|`|iVWE2wR1aa	hahha i hope so Donkey Kong was the Shiiiiiit!

R02vAa48aa	If you're going to play live poker then yes, ABSOLUTELY tip the dealer every time you win the pot. They aren't casino owners and the tip shows appreciation. If you are going to raise then say, "raise" before you put your money into the pot. Never say, "I'll see your bet and i raise". It's called a string bet and the raise won;t be allowed. If you're unsure what to do then ask the dealer...Although casinos mostly have the same rules - each casino has different variations.<br>  <br>  Tipping also goes for the free drinks you get while playing. $1.00 is sufficient per drink.<br>  <br>  If you're going to play the casino table games then tell the dealer that you don't know the rules. They will be happy to help you.|`|85AoQYh8aa	I wouldnt say tip the dealer if you win a pot i would say if you walk away from the table a big winner throw him something but every nice pot i wouldnt they are already ******* you with rake so screw them.<br>  <br>  Also if you are going to play poker there dont exchange chips with chips in the pot for example if you want to bet 300 but all you have is a 500 chip dont throw in the 500 chip and take 200 declare your bet verbally and put the 500 chip in and the dealer will do it for you.<br>  <br>  Some dont mind, but for a lot of them its a big no no.  i remember one of my first tournies i played a $50 buy in and i did this and this ***** of a dealer goes off on me saying something like this isnt a home game in a real condesending voice i was young.

So if you have both of them, you add them together and get 2 in 200,000,000 which is the same as 1 in 100,000,000.

QukP3WI1aa	i completely agree! i really dislike everything about the new website. :( I used to love the games under the tab "roi games", and now i can't find them anywhere. It's impossible to find new games, as all of the old ones were just put under different titles and icons. i wish they would have kept it the same. despite that the old website was in korean, which i don't completely understand, it was much easier to navigate than the new one in english. <br>  <br>  try the website dressupgames.com, there are many links there. <br>  girlsgogames.com is also a website with a good number of games. also, if you go to deviantart.com and look under flash -> interactive, you can find some wonderful games.

mOTCr8Pxaa	You can't get charmander in game. Although a fire type would fit but the only fire types in D/P you can get earlier are rapidash and vulpix. I used Bronzong in my team, not a good choice unless you ise it for what is was designed for: defense. You get sneasel too late and you can't get riolu until you beat the champ anyway. Gastly works.|`|xjZKpXTTaa	Heracross, Alakazam, Gyarados, and Torterra are great choices, however, Staraptor = fail. I wouldn't go with it if I were you.<br>  <br>  I would replace Staraptor with a Charizard (for fire and flying coverage), and for your final pokemon I would suggest a Jolteon (for electric coverage and great speed). You get Eevee from Bebe after getting the National Dex, and if you get either a modest or a timid Eevee, it would make an AMAZING Jolteon!|`|ou2FKXMhaa	Lucario no contest. or maybe mewtwo. i have the game and my team is onix, turtwig,and a pikachu i think.. i lost the game a month ago|`|CiQwreWHaa	either gliscor togekiss regigigas or floatzel|`|z4KDb5l3aa	Charmander lvl 100 FTW?|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Anyone of the ones you suggested will work.

0TT5q0cUaa	the second version was'nt a huge sucess so i dont think so they would seriosly consider it
QWHpXlNCaa	they aren't opening for a few about a month. that wll probably be your answer. they probably don't like to send all kinds of things out to future help until the last minute. why? because how many people back out in that length of time and never actually go to work there. when they realize you are serious your stuff will show up. they may even make you come in and get it in the end.
wPnJekdqaa	Resident Evil 4 was a reboot of the series, there are very little links to the games before it both in terms of gameplay and storyline. You should be fine just picking it up.<br>  <br>  If you want to know the rest of the stories, instead of hunting down each individual game, try picking up Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii. It'll fill you in with everything you want to know about the series without exposing you to ancient graphics and old gameplay and completely skipping the awful Code Veronica.|`|lVm6TBd8aa	Nah, you don't need the others because it's a different storyline, people and enimies in Resident evil 4 compared to all the other resident evils. Just to let you know the 5th resident evil comes out in about a week. Anyway bottom line you don't need the other resident evils to understand the fourth one.|`|pOL4Z3xAaa	nah number 4 goes into a different direction, there not even zombies in it jus mad spainish people!|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	resident evil 4 has a different story ^^|`|zM0ag4NLaa	resident evil 4 starts all diffrent it begins in some spanish speaking place. you don't really have to play the first ones cuz the story diffrent. i say play re4 and have fun it is an awesome game|`|mvu0yrF8aa	in Resident Evil 4, there are no zombies only people infected with a new type of virus. Get Resident Evil for the Game Cube. It's really scary but fun.|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	they should have made them all like the first three .|`|VlxBs9zyaa	no!<br>  its so good,<br>  <br>  get it for the wii|`|uctxzjIIaa	While most of the earlier games all had a consistently developing story, RE4's story is off in it's own little world. It's entirely possible RE5 (and maybe later ones) will tie RE4 back in, but as of yet it is still quite disconnected.<br>  <br>  If you want the cliff's notes version of the earlier story, check out Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles. Or for a more full version, read the Plot Synopsis guide on GameFAQs under all the RE games (it's the same file linked to from each game).|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Resident Evil 4 was the first (and so far only) Resident Evil game I have ever played, and when I got it for the Wii, I loved it and played it all the way through. It's a great game, I recommend you get it. The story makes sense even if you have not played the previous games in the franchise.
fxF2oraPaa	pokemon is your best bet, unfortunately|`|s4bpeNhDaa	If you have a DS I really liked playing disgaea. <br>  That's a game that you can spend a loooooooooooooooooooong time playing. <br>  By the time you finish with that, I'm sure there'll be a whole lot more hand held rpgs I could recommend to you.<br>  So I'd suggest Disgaea for now.|`|VooQlYt3aa	Chrono Trigger DS.

OZ0DgzrJaa	I am assuming you mean in World of Warcraft.  <br>  <br>  Druids can only wear cloth and leather (I think).  I know they cannot wear mail.  The mail using classes are Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, and eventually Shaman.<br>  <br>  As for the maces, it entirely depends on what the bonuses of the mace is.  Larger weapons do more burst damage in the hands of a warrior with skills specific to it, but I'm not sure how much a caster class like the druid gets out of the weapon itself.|`|Qd6TX2rbaa	druids can only wear cloth and leather. if  u want a toon that gets mail and is awsome with maces roll a paladin.pallys are good tanks and dps depending spec u choose. if u do go pally i suggest u get a human.

xDubataIaa	EGM actually closed its doors back in January, after its publisher Ziff Davis sold them and the 1up network to Hearst. The February issue was the last one, and it was released for free online. It sucks as it was also my favorite gaming mag. Due to high overhead costs the magazine is definitely not coming back (from what I have read) but it lives on through its website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/pubs?did=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.1up.com/do/pubs?did=2</a><br>  <br>  Some of the members still contribute to the website, although the majority of reviewers and editors are long gone.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	It was bought out by another company.  No idea what's going to happen to the mags.  Lots of people are complaining that they haven't gotten any new issues in a while, and they haven't gotten a refund, so maybe EGM is just in a transition period, and it'll start publishing mags again in the near future.<br>  <br>  EGM was always my favorite gaming mag.  I guess there's still Gamepro.  It's not as good, but it'll have to do.

8t5vPDnqaa	That first hand should never have happened.  You should have made him fold before it got that far.  The second hand is a bit of bad luck, but you also could have made him fold before it got that far.<br>  <br>  I used to always get screwed on the river card.  And then I tried a new tactic - not letting it get to the river card unless I really really want it to.  Now I win consistently and often don't even have to show my cards.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Pretty slim, I'd say.<br>  <br>  Take two hands in a vacuum in a 30 minute span the odds of any two hands being exactly dealt like they are would be pretty slim.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	in general, say blackjack for instance only 1% of gamblers us basic strategy and 99% play poorly.   probably the same for poker...99% donkeys....now the second hand maybe the guy couldn't get away from his aces but your piss poor play with the first allowed him in cheaply..you idiots go to the river so often, that sh-it is likely to happen|`|GaGrw9qqaa	I agree that seems a bit weird, however would you be asking this question if it was you that pulled those hands?
f6rHiAe2aa	Yes, it causes a Re-Play. He can attack you but when you trigger Call of the Haunted, he can stop the attack. Only if you activated Call of the Haunted in the Main Phase(saying it was a weaker monster, such as Kuriboh, and he has something like Mystical Elf) and he attacks, then you reveal Rush Recklessly to increase Kuriboh's ATK. He can't stop this attack in this scenario!.....unless the Mystical Elf gained this weird effect by Spell or Trap card. So the answer is he can stop his attack from a monster if you summon another monster to the field. Best Strategy: activate Call of the Haunted, Special Summon Winged Kuriboh, activate Transcendent Wings, and Special Summon Winged Kuriboh LV 10 and tribute it to damage him(I think you would like this nasty little effect)...but then there Shining Angel...instead of Call of the Haunted...Shinning Angel's effect(when destroyed in battle) summons another Fairy-Type from your deck with 1500 ATK or less and surprise him with the combo above!|`|jTLxF4ZNaa	if its is a direct attack, no beause a direct attack can only be done when a monster is not present. When u summon the monster the attack target  is changed to that monster. If he attacks a monster then a attack target stays the same unless the card effect says differently.<br>  by the way, Call of the haunted is banned.|`|ZzgPG5KQaa	yes, the monster count changes, so a do a replay|`|Bmx6AtDCaa	yes because the battle must be replayed dats juss how it works hope that helped|`|uu9fmHqfaa	Yes they can because a replay occurs.<br>  <br>  Whenever the number of monsters on the field change you restart the battle phase. Monsters that already attacked prior to the replay occurring would not be able to attack again unless its an effect.<br>  <br>  BTW:<br>  In situations like magician's circle if your opponents number of monsters don't change then no replay occurs and the initial attack would continue.

4He3bNO7aa	GOOD<br>  <br>  ? It's free. [see note #1]<br>  <br>  ? You will make some great friends.<br>  <br>  ? You can do anything you want. [see note #2]<br>  <br>  ? You have total freedom to make your avatar look any way you want.<br>  <br>  ? You can role-play.<br>  <br>  ? You can build.<br>  <br>  ? You can learn new skills.<br>  <br>  ? You can create a business and make money.<br>  <br>  ? You can go to live music events in SL.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BAD<br>  <br>  ? Everyone on Yahoo Answers who is a moron will call you a moron for playing SL.<br>  <br>  ? There are some serious jerks hanging around in SL.<br>  <br>  ? Land costs money.<br>  <br>  ? You will eventually need money to enjoy yourself. [see note #1]<br>  <br>  ? There are too many people in SL so it gets laggy, TPs don't work sometimes and crashing is something you need to get used to. [see note #3]<br>  <br>  Note #1: ALthough it's free to join and play SL, money is what makes SL work and if you want nice clothes, a place to live or other luxuries, you will need cash. For this you enter your credit card details on your account page and that lets you buy SL Money (L$). L$1000 costs around US$4.80. You never have to buy money though - it's totally optional.<br>  <br>  Note #2: Please look at my past answers about SL as I have answered the question 'What can you do in Second Life?' probably more than any other.<br>  <br>  Note #3: Weekends are bad in SL and it gets laggy to the point where I sometimes give up and go and do something else. Joining at a weekend will drive you crazy as you try to log in for the first time and keep getting login failure messages. Again this topic is something I've covered many times before, so look at some of my previous answers.<br>  <br>  Finally, people who say it's nothing but crap, or those who say it's nothing but amazing are both selling you short. At it's best, SL is wonderful, but you have to have an imagination. Sadly, it's let down in some areas - especially the problems with lag and failed teleports - and the percentage of idiots who come to SL just looking for cybersex will drive you crazy. There is also a fair number of the sort you see everywhere on the Internet, who think that, because they're safely at home and on a computer, they have the right to go around insulting everyone ... a bit like some people you find here on Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  Really, you can only judge SL by your own standards. Whatever you decide is the best answer here, only you can decide if it's something you will enjoy. Try the totally free account and if - after say a month - you like it, consider adding CC details to be able to buy a bit of cash every now and again. If you decide you don't like it, you simply don't log in again. You won't get billed for anything and you'll have lost nothing.|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	Second Life really isn't that great at all.

gGQwr9Gkaa	1.) I'm guessing your friends have to ask. Because one of my friends in town asked to come over. I said yes. He wanted to know what time. I put in the time that I wanted. And he came over.

Sell stuff you don't need or want, don't buy stuff that costs to much, and if you have the silver or golden shovel, then hit any rock you see. If a coin falls out then press "A" rapidly! Until 2 or 3 bags of $$ come out. Only happens once a day. And 3.) I doubt you can have a crush. Hope it helps. :)

Omg how old are you?|`|Rgb3WkXVaa	Why don't you just go buy a webkinz instead of having someone else give on to you?<br>  <br>  Any ways i hope someone is willing to give you their account.

P4YKNZcMaa	Try deleting autoexec if it exists.  Find the steamaps folder (in the steam folder) go to your user name, then CSS.  Then find the cfg folder (probably in a folder named counter strike or similar).  Default res will vary based on your comp, I'd suggest trying 1024X768 if you need a value but aren't sure what to use.
PGvjEvjMaa	With only one tuner youre hardly going to get any synchros so the assault mode cards are going to be dead cards 99% of the time, replace them with torrential tribute and mirror force, also take out the 3 sakus for the 3 solemn judgment. remove 2 zombie worlds, cannon and magical stone for a allure of darkness, sangan, brain control and a ccv if you have 1
FkXt4XLvaa	I am guessing you mean feathers...and the easiest answer to this would be masks.<br>  <br>  Cut out eye and mouth holes from the paper plates.<br>  <br>  Tape the popsicle sticks to the bottom if you want to hold it up to your face.<br>  <br>  If you want it to fit around your face, cut the rubber bands in half and either punch holes in the sides of the plates and tie an end of the band through each or staple an end to each side. <br>  <br>  Do a few of each so both the sticks and bands are used.<br>  <br>  Decorate the front with feathers (and anything else you are allowed to improvise with).|`|vADIpPxtaa	Easter chicks! (If the feathers are yellow). <br>  <br>  Or birds of a different feather (hardy har har)

CysVPqXsaa	Yup!!! That's because they are both a DS system and the only difference is that the DS original is the original design of a DS while the DS Lite is just lighter, and the screen is a little bit brighter. So if you buy a game for the DS system, the games can be played on both the DS original and DS Lite.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!! Good Luck!!!!!|`|DU8zxsKRaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Any game without peripherals that can be played on a DS-fat can be played on a DS-lite or a DSi.<br>  <br>  Any game that requires peripherals (Guitar Hero) cannot be played on the DSi, but can still be played on either the DS-fat or the DS-lite.<br>  <br>  Down the road, there's likely to be DSi-specific games that won't work on either of the prior versions, but if it works on a DS-fat, it will work on a DS-lite.|`|AA11934838	yes ds games can be played on ds lite.|`|tCkhYezwaa	Yes it can because I have a DS Lite and all I play are ds games and gameboy games. The DS Lite is just a new version of the DS with a brighter screen and it is more small and compact. So you don't have to worry about buying new games for it.|`|8FlSSQIGaa	they are the same systems! just that one is lighter and thinner than the other. so the best ds lite games are the best ds games as well|`|YJjUZU2jaa	Yes a DS game can be played on a DS Lite.|`|66AZhLnEaa	Yes, and you can get a printable list from gamestop
3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	You could have your picture taken together by her favorite landmark and then decorate the frame, do a collage<br>  of pictures of the both of you, do<br>  a shadow box and include little memories of a special time together.<br>  Put together a small photo album and<br>  do scrap booking pages.|`|mgeuli7Naa	A picture frame would be nice. Also a little box with decorations might be nice. Maybe some form of pottery.|`|0LY3xWqgaa	A scrapbook of some of the things you did with them would be a meaningful gift.  This is a fun personal gift they will treasure for a long time.  You can keep it simple.  You can create a traditional scrapbook or a digital scrapbook.

5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	I believe that if you just print on regular transfer paper, the background won't be visible (unless you've intentionally made the background white), though whatever you've added will be somewhat translucent.  The paper itself won't look clear though... it's just that parts that haven't been printed on won't transfer since there's nothing to transfer.<br>   <br>  The transfer papers "for dark shirts" though have "colors" that will be very opaque so those papers are often used on non-white and light-colored shirts so the colors will show up well on colored shirts and dark shirts.<br>  <br>  In either situation, I think anything you don't include intentionally won't show up on the shirt after transferring though.<br>  <br>  <br>  HTH,<br>  <br>  Diane B.|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	If there is a background around the letters then that background will transfer when you iron. The only way to<br>  avoid this is to buy individual letters<br>  or cut them out.
xDubataIaa	No the PS3 cannot get a virus. You might just be a bad driver or maybe your controller is messed up but it is definitely not the work of a virus.<br>  <br>  *Edit* There are no known viruses for the PS3. Stop giving the guy bad advice. The PS3 isn't like a regular PC just because it has a HDD. It cannot run unsigned code (unless it is a modded PS3), and unless Sony themselves manage to release a virus through a system update I cannot imagine how you could manage to get a virus on the console.|`|ohhXoCpOaa	Yes i would say so, i didnt think the PS3 could get viruses but if yours does have one that could effect game play. is it effecting anything else on the console?|`|0xp9Oobnaa	it is possible, but none out there yet because the ps3 acts a similar way as  in the system like a PC, your chances of getting a virus is 0% on ur ps3, but if there's problem with a game then must be a glitch for sure or just faulty hardware.|`|hYzi5efvaa	no it wont affect your gameplay soz|`|66AZhLnEaa	Maybe
