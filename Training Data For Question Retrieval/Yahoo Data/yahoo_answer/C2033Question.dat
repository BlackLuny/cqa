20081001152100AAzSu2z	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Why do people insist that 360 is better.?	Even with all the facts that prove that the PS3 is better in both Hardware and Software, why do people still insist that X-Box 360 is better?      Just so I don't get any responses saying "Let's see the facts" I'll list them:      1.No cost for good internet!:   -I've played online several times, no lag at all, no problems, the internet is never down, and is always reliable. Plus the Playstation store loads instantly, and downloads are quick.      2.Better/More memory:   -360 games are printed on 9G DVD's, PS3 games are printed on 50G Bluray Discs, not only are Bluray discs better in terms of storage, but they are more indestructible(they can withstand several smudges and scratches and still work perfectly), plus Bluray Discs will replace DVD's in a matter of 1 to 2 years.      3.Cheaper console:   -While X-box is labeled at $300, which seems like a $100 save, the hidden costs can add up to a lot more! firstly it is $100 extra just to connect it to the internet(not everyone has a computer right next to their console), plus it's $50 a year for X-box live(which adds up to at least $450, and that's without any games!      4.More reliable:   -The X-box 360 gets the Red Ring of Death/Dies at least once every three years(very occasionally does it not), PS3? no, because a console that was made to last for 10 years doesn't have that kind of problem.       5.Sharable PSN games:   -if you download a game, or if your friend downloads a game, you can both have it, only one of you has to pay for it, up to five people can have one paid for game!      6.Easy Charge controllers!   you can charge the controllers using your computer or PS3 console(the charge cord connects via USB. with X-box 360, you either have to continuously change the batteries or pay extra for a charging station. You don't have to waste extra money on Chargers or Betteries, like you would with teh X-box.      7.Blue-tooth!   -almost all of the acessories are blue-tooth, which means they are all connected through wi-fi, so none of them need any extra mumbo jumbo to work.      8.More/Better DLC:   ie: Rock Band 2 is coming out for PS3 a month after it does for X-box, however PS3 is getting 20 Free downloadable songs in return!      9.The acessories for PS3 are cheaper!   -Wireless headset:   360: $60   PS3: $40-$50   -Media Remote:   360 $20(DVD only)   PS3 $25(DVD, BD, Menu, etc.)   -New Controller:   360 $50+(Cost of batteries)x   PS3 $55(rechargable, plus Dualshock, and Sixaxis)      10.Better games:   -Okay, I know I'm gonna get some skeptics here, but listen! Heavenly Sword, Soul Callibur 4(with Darth Vader!), Dark Sector, Disgaea 3, of the ones that are out. and LittleBigPlanet, Mirrors Edge, Valkyria Chronicles, White Knight Chronicles, Bioshock(1-3), Kingdom Hearts 3, and a bunch more games are coming soon. If you think about it all X-box has is Gears of War, Halo, and Fable, and frankly, aside from Fable, those games are pretty mediocre.(in my opinion of course)      So please(X-box fanboys) explain to me why you choose the worse of the two consoles, when facts for facts, PS3 is better.

Observo que inician de nuevo los Ataques de clones o gamers de PS3, XBOX 360 y Wii, Obvio que los de la Catego Wii son los mas atacados puesto que jamas he dado click en catego PS3 o XBOX.      Bueno lo que quiero comentar es que ya paso de Moda esto de pelearse haber que Consola es la Mejor, la Polemica se da solo al Inicio de las ventas primarias de determinada consola, Wii Gano fue la lider y lo sigue haciendo.      Ahora para que pelearse por que consola es la mejor???   Que cada quien se quede con su consola agusto, sin fastidiar a los demas, digo a estas alturas ya no me importan las 3 consolas por que ya pienso en el Futuro por 3 razones-->>>      Wii--------> YA NO INNOVA EN LOS JUEGOS, ESTANCADO DESDE HACE RATO.      XBOX 360---> SE QUEMARON BASTANTES CONSOLAS Y SOLO LOS QUE LOS SALVA ES EL "LIVE" FUERA DE ESO "X"      PS3--->>> SUPER MAQUINOTA, PERO IGUAL NO OBTUVO LA POPULARIDAD ESPERADA, COMO LA PS2 O PS1, SUPER CARA PARA LA MAYORIA DE LA GENTE, Y QUE NO SE EXPLOTA SU MAXIMA CAPACIDAD CON INTERNET DE ANCHA BANDA Y UNA T.V.

Bueno pues mi pregunta pasada la eliminaron, no se si me han de ver reportado o por otra cosa, no me gusta la Hipocresia, me agrada la gente clara y madura, que exprese su desacuerdo de mis opiniones y listo.      La pregunta es que no creo que Wii sea una consola de Nueva Generacion ya que estaba comparando el juego de SONIC UNLEASHED con el de PS3 y no puede ser la diferencia es enorme y claro dejando a un lado las magnificas graficas del PS3, lo relevante es que aka ahi mas enemigos con IA muy amplia lo que en Wii solo son pocos enemigos y el juego es mas lineal, en PS3 son mas largos los mundos, interactuas diferente es decir siento que nos dieron una kaka de juego para el Wii, por que nada k ver con el de PS3.      En realidad si es consola de nueva generacion?    solo por su control remoto?   dejo un video nomas para que chequen la diferencia, espero lo vean en alta definicion y plasmen sus opiniones, saludos camaradas.

Right now, I have this horrible Sony Ericsson phone which i hate and i am dying to get a new one, but cannot decide. It is mainly between these phones, unless you recommend any other great AT&T phones:  - HTC Fuze (looks cool, but is kind of expensive)  - Quickfire (also looks cool)  - Blackberry Bold  - Blackberry Pearl  - Blackberry Curve  - Samsung Eternity    Ok so those are the phones I have been looking into, if you have any info or recommendations on any of those or another one, please answer to help me out!! I want to make sure I pick the right phone this time!!! Thanks sooo much.

In my scenario, to help manage pirates, the game disk will need to be inserted into the PS3 in order to start the game, but this is only to verify that the person owns the game.      During loading, data would be taken from the hard drive to minimize loading times.      When you insert a game 4 the first time, u would be asked weather you want a complete install, or partial install of the game, and just like now, it would be impossible to start the game without the disk.

20090130192053AADirJD	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Text Messaging Delay?	I have an LG 8600 Chocolate Flip.  Got the phone in August, 2008.  Have had nothing but problems with it.  But the most common problem is in my text messaging.  Since the beginning I would get occasional delays.  The last 4 days, almost 50% of my incoming messages are delayed by 20, 30 minutes, even up to 12 hours.  So I brought it to TELUS, AGAIN.  After 5 visits to the store in the last 4 weeks, and several downloads, they have sent it for repairs.  Not sure what they are going to repair though, since text messaging is a network problem, right?        Ok so here is the real kicker....I now have a loaner phone, also an LG, but an older phone.  I sent a message when i got it, worked fine going out then DELAYED incoming again, by 20 minutes.  And this continues to happen all night.        FYI   I have several friends with TELUS, and no one else is having any delays.   It is not always the same contact, it's all of my contacts.   It's not always another TELUS client, I have Rogers, Bell and Solo (I think it's Solo).      Can someone help?  Do you think my phone number has a jinx on it!?  Just kidding!  But please any information will be valued!

I left the console on  and was gone for maybe a half an hour. When I came back, it said that it had lost contact with the wiimote (which I guess is normal), so I turned the wiimote back on, saved my game, and went back to the home menu from in the game.      After the home menu booted up, the wiimote didn't seem to be registering at all,  no on-screen pointer or vibration or anything. Since then I've tried re-synching it (synch button on wiimote + synch button on wii) a few times, and even tried synching it as a temporary controller (that plus the 1 + 2 buttons) (and before all this, I replaced the batteries with freshly charged ones)      It's still not registering on the motion sensor, and there's no response when I press "A" on the start-up screen. In addition, whenever I press any button, it just flashes all four lights on the bottom. Either it thinks it's controller 4 or, more likely, is just blinking.       Please help, I want to keep playing :c

20090130191532AAoWwNq	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Someone called my phone under my nephew's ID, and it turned out to be someone else. help?	Someone had called me recently, and on the caller ID, it said "nephew". But when I picked up, someone i didn't know was talking--and clearly wasn't my nephew. I asked who they were, and they said "Big Daddy". I hung up after.   I don't know if there's something wrong with my phone or what, but my nephew said he couldn't call me with his phone, but everyone else i knew could. The weird thing is that when the guy called, it was under my nephew's caller ID.   I know my nephew didn't do any prank calling, because i called him, and asked if he called me. He said he did, but he couldn't get through, but when he tried to call, it was the exact time the "big daddy" guy called me.   I'm really confused. I have AT&T and my nephew has T-mobile. Does anyone know what the problem is?
