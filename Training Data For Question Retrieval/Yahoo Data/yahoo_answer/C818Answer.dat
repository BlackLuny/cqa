I also made some substitutions. I use just plain cream cheese instead of the mascarpone and Keebler Vienna Finger cookies instead of the ladyfingers.  This gives it a little crunch to the final texture.  The first time I fixed it one of our guests said it was better than the Tiramisu he had eaten when at Harrods in London. <br>  <br>  <br>  Marcia Ivey-Hudson|`|1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	Tiramisu Venetian Style<br>  Dolce all'Amaretto<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  6 large eggs, separated<br>  8-12 tablespoons sugar<br>  2 cups (500 g) mascarpone cheese, drained of any excess liquid<br>  1 cup (240 ml) sweet vermouth<br>  Two 7-ounce (420 g) packages amaretti cookies <br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of the sugar until foamy and pale. Beat in the mascarpone until smooth. Stir in the egg yolks; set aside.<br>  In a large bowl, using a standing or hand-held mixer, whip the egg whites until frothy. Add the remaining tablespoon of sugar and beat until they hold soft peaks. Fold the mascarpone mixture into the egg whites. Set aside.<br>  <br>  Pour the vermouth into a small bowl. Reserve five amaretti cookies to crumble and sprinkle over the top of the dessert. One at a time, dip the remaining amaretti cookies into the vermouth; they should absorb some of the liquid but not be mushy. Place the soaked amaretti in one snug layer on the bottom of a 9-inch ceramic dish or pie plate. Evenly spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the amaretti. Place another layer of soaked cookies over the mascarpone. Repeat the layering, spreading the remaining mascarpone mixture, then ending with a layer of soaked cookies; this layer should be loosely arranged so that the cream mixture below is visible. Sprinkle with the crumbled dry amaretti. Refrigerate to set for at least 2 hours. <br>  ---------<br>  Tiramisu<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  3 large eggs, separated<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  1 (8-oz) container mascarpone cheese (1 scant cup) <br>  1/2 cup chilled heavy cream<br>  2 cups very strong brewed coffee or brewed espresso, cooled to room temperature<br>  2 tablespoons sweet Marsala wine<br>  18 savoiardi (crisp Italian ladyfingers, 6 oz) <br>  1/4 cup fine-quality sweet chocolate shavings (not unsweetened; made with a vegetable peeler) or 2 tablespoons sweetened cocoa powder <br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  Beat together yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Beat in mascarpone until just combined. <br>  Beat whites with a pinch of salt in another bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar a little at a time, beating, then continue to beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat cream in another bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds soft peaks. Fold cream into mascarpone mixture gently but thoroughly, then fold in whites. <br>  <br>  Stir together coffee and Marsala in a shallow bowl. Dip 1 ladyfinger in coffee mixture, soaking it about 4 seconds on each side, and transfer to an 8-inch glass baking dish (2-quart capacity). Repeat with 8 more ladyfingers and arrange in bottom of dish, trimming as needed to fit snugly. Spread half of mascarpone mixture evenly over ladyfingers. Make another layer in same manner with remaining ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.

Dip the top sides of 1/2 of the lady fingers in the coffee and place in the bottom of serving dish. You will need to cover the bottom of the dish, so only use as many lady fingers as needed to do so.<br>  4. Take refrigerated whipped cream and fold into the cheese mixture.<br>  5. Spread 1/3 of mixture over lady fingers and dust with cocoa powder.<br>  6. Repeat steps 3 and 5, ending with the cheese mixture on top.<br>  7.

It depends what type of tea I am drinking. If I'm drinking an English tea, such as English Breakfast, I prefer a bit of sugar and cream or milk and honey. If it is a fruity tea that needs a little boost of sweetness, just a tad of sugar or honey really makes a difference. However, if I am drinking a green tea or a white tea, then it is best without any additions at all. Pure Japanese or Chinese tea is a very sophisticated and wonderful drink.

AA11507775	dont do shots, know ur limits. dont drink vodka cos its disgusting. dont drink on ur lunch break. either that or just dont go back to school and keep drinkin till ur smashed lol.<br>  <br>  the best advice for covering up the smell on ur breath is to take a few gulps of olive oil after drinking. the oil floats as a layer on top of the stuff in ur stomach, that stops the alcohol vapours getting past. <br>  <br>  once olcohol is at a strong enough concentration it will start vapourising into your lungs so u have to chew something minty or liquorice to cover the smell.<br>  <br>  guys are normally bigger which means more blood which means more dilution of blood alcohol, which means less vapour forming in the lungs.|`|4Vojc48Eaa	Firstly, who the f*** drinks during school hours? HAHA Dumb kids. You wanna say you're ready to drink but then you freak out when you realize it comes with side effects. hah.<br>  <br>  The reason "it didn't help" is because the smell comes from your stomach, not your mouth. You can't get rid of the smell, just shower, brush your teeth, and go to sleep.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Best way to not smell like alcohol is to not drink when it will matter|`|ygTSKitBaa	Guys (such as myself) smell bad to begin with, thats why alcohol isn't as noticeable. <br>  Try to eat some chips or cheetos or something like that. It will help soak up some of the alcohol in your stomach and it will cover up the smell much better with something that smells more natural than gum and lotion. Also if you have something like AXE (I know you're a girl and you don't use Axe) try using some of that as well.
5zNwBQZHaa	Your health teacher is teaching junk science and doesn't have a clue about nutrition.<br>  <br>  First - vitamins and minerals are not enriched - food is enriched with vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  For example - salt has iodine added to it.  Iodine is not readily found in many foods anymore - so it we didn't get it from it being added somewhere, we would be iodine deficient. <br>  <br>  There are only a few examples like that where a vitamin is only available though enriched food - but it does happen.<br>  <br>  Chemically the vitamins that are added to food - and the vitamins naturally in food are identical.  If they were different they would not go by the same name.  Vitamins do come in different forms - and some are more absorbable than others - these variances occur in nature as well.<br>  <br>  Man - the more I think about it, the more I think your Health Teacher should not be teaching.

9epL6qjBaa	Here's the procedure:<br>  <br>  1) Start with a cigar, hand rolled that has been stored in a humidor.<br>  2)  Cut the smoking end.  You can guillotine, notch, whatever you prefer.<br>  3)  Use a long, wooden match to properly light it<br>  4)  As you are lighting it, roll it as you puff to evenly light it<br>  5)  The match flame should not actually touch, but be very close to the cigar end<br>  6)  Do not over puff as you have a danger of "overheating the bowl" and it will taste burned.<br>  <br>  Lastly, cigar smoke is not meant to be inhaled, but puffed, rolled around on the pallet and exhaled, slowly.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|ygTSKitBaa	Light it up (I prefer a wooden match) and don't smoke it like a cigarette where you inhale all the smoke, you want to "kiss" it, kind of. When you suck on the cigar you only want to take the smoke into your mouth. <br>  It is a wise idea if you do not inhale, as cigars are not filtered as well as cigarettes.

U3XxUY6Taa	These are some I have tried...I have about 400 chicken recipes, haven't tried them all...yet<br>  <br>  Two-Skillet Herb-Roasted Chicken with Oven Fries  Created by Michel Nischan From the June, 2004 issue of O,  Makes 4 servings <br>  Chef Michel Nischan says that cooking chicken in two separate skillets really speeds up the process! <br>  1 (3- to 3 1/4-pound) chicken                       <br>   1 bunch thyme<br>  1 bunch sage                                               <br>  1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper<br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  6 medium Yukon gold potatoes, thinly sliced<br>  1 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil           <br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper              <br>  1 small onion, finely diced<br>   (3-inch) rosemary sprigs                       <br>   6 sage sprigs, with 3 to 4 leaves each<br>  Canola oil nonstick cooking spray<br>  Preheat oven to 425°F with a 10-inch cast-iron skillet inside. Remove giblets and neck. Rinse chicken with cold water; drain, then pat dry with paper towels. Butterfly by cutting along both sides of the backbone with kitchen scissors; discard backbone. Lay chicken out flat, skin side down. With the heel of your hand, firmly press breastbone to flatten chicken; turn skin side up. <br>  Divide thyme and sage each into 4 equal portions. Loosen skin from chicken over breasts and thighs; insert thyme under skin over each breast and thigh. <br>  Over medium-high flame, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken skin side down in skillet with leg portion closest to the handle. Cook until skin is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Turn chicken over; place sage on each breast and thigh. Remove 10-inch skillet from oven; place on top of chicken (bottom down) so handles match. <br>  Pan-roast chicken 30 minutes. Remove top skillet. Cook chicken 10 more minutes. It is done when meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh (without touching the bone) reads 175° to 180° and juices run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Let chicken stand 10 minutes before carving. To make the fries, preheat oven to 400°F with a 12-inch cast-iron skillet inside. In a large bowl, toss potatoes, 2 tsp. oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, and pepper. <br>  Brush hot skillet with remaining 1 tsp. oil. Place potatoes in skillet. Oven-roast them until browned on bottom, about 20 minutes. Turn them over and sprinkle with onion. Lightly coat rosemary and sage sprigs with cooking spray; add to potatoes. Oven-roast potatoes until browned and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Stack potatoes with herbs on a warm platter.<br>  <br>  BALSAMIC SOY-GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS <br>  Roasting the wings before tossing them with this tangy glaze is our secret to getting crisp skin.<br>  4 lb chicken wingettes  <br>  2 TB olive oil 1/2 tsp  salt<br>  1/2 tsp  black pepper<br>  3/4 cup balsamic vinegar<br>  1/4 cup soy sauce<br>  2 tsp  sugar<br>  1 TB unsalted butter<br>  Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 large shallow baking pans (17 by 11 inches) with foil. Put pans in oven and preheat oven to 500°F.<br>  Pat wings dry, then toss with oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and divide between preheated pans, spreading wings in 1 layer. Roast, without turning, until golden and tender, about 35 minutes. <br>  While wings roast, simmer vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/3 cup, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter until melted. <br>  Remove roasted wings from oven and let stand in pans 1 minute (to make wings easier to remove from foil), then transfer with tongs to a clean large bowl.<br>  Pour balsamic mixture over wings and toss to coat well. Let stand 5 minutes, then toss again.<br>  Cooks' note: To make wingettes from regular chicken wings, cut off and discard tips from chicken wings with kitchen shears or a large heavy knife, then halve wings at joint.  Makes 4 (main course) or 6 to 8 (snack) servings.

Slice half of the lemon crosswise as thinly as possible; discard any seeds. Squeeze 1 1/2 tsp of juice from the remaining lemon half. <br>  In a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, toss the carrots with 3 TB of the oil, the coriander and cumin seeds, the cayenne and lemon juice. Season with salt.

Tonight we had pine nut chicken, asparagus, and some of those fettucini noodles with herbs and olive oil.  MMMM-MMMMMM  GOOD!!  Or, she fixes the BEST baked potatoes in the world, and maybe that's why she was part owner of a baked potato store in the local mall for many years.  Oh, and her chicken alfredo, with broccoli and some noodles or some starchy foods, and of course, I get a glass of White Zinfandel wine.  But then, she fixes some great mesquite chicken, with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  And, she does fix WONDERFUL pizzas, with green and black olives (my favorites), and onion, mushrooms, turkey pepperoni, cheeses and tomato sauce and tomato paste, and sometimes she slips in another of my favorite spices that she surprises me with.  Oh, and her lasagna is INCREDIBLY great, and her chicken spaghetti is "out-of-this-world"!!!!<br>  <br>  But, now, was your question supposed to be confined to what might be served in a school cafeteria?  I hope not, because the last time I ate at one of those, at one of the universities I attended, they couldn't do any food any justice, and highschool and gradeschool cafeterias were a million times worse, so, in those cases, I'd say my favorite food, or the food I'd prefer is any food not served there.  I didn't  think it was fit for human consumption back then, and my opinion hasn't gone up since then.  God Bless you.

6SwaWSoyaa	Do you want this stuff from scratch or a mix? Well first of all, gather your items for making a cookie or gather the items to make a sugar cookie, because it is the true base of all cookies. Gather any of your favorite spices or fruits, etc. Anything that you think would make a great combination get it gathered up and prepare to bake.<br>  <br>  You say that you are interested in cinnamon buns. Mix the cookie idea and the cinnamon bun idea. You could make a snickerdoodle cookie (which includes cinnamon) and add what all you want in there. After you bake it, you could make your own icing with powder sugar and milk, or powder sugar and water. Then after that you could add whatever toppings you can imagine that would be super tasty.<br>  <br>  Also another great way to go is getting out of the box mixes. You can create anything with cookie, cake, and bread mixes. You can add everything you would li\ke, although I suggest non-perishable items. If you must add sour cream, cream cheese or anything, make sure you think it would be tasty cold. You could add nuts, peanut butter, soft drinks, or whatever you like. I recommend if you do different juices or drinks, replace that with the water, and also go for low fat drinks such as fruit juice, koolaid, sprite, ginger ale, etc.<br>  <br>  As for a basic cookie recipe, look at sugar cookies or here is the recipe for a basic cookie.<br>  <br>  1/2 c. butter<br>  1 c. sugar (granulated or powdered<br>  2 eggs<br>  1 tsp. vanilla<br>  2 1/2 c. sifted all-purpose flour<br>  2 tsp. baking powder<br>  <br>  Mix butter with sugar.

There are many vegetables that just should not be eaten raw due to the molecular changes that take place during the cooking process.

The reason the drinking age is 21 nationally is simply money. A basic history lesson shows that any powers not delegated to the federal government by the constitution are reserved to the states. Laws regarding alcohol are reserved to the states, which is why I can go to a bar until 4AM while you more than likely can't (at least when you are 21). Anyway, the federal government used funding to force the states to comply with the federal governments plans, raise the drinking age and you get money, don't raise it and your on your own. So state legislature said "OH F*CK, we want money so we'll comply" and that's why the drinking age is 21.

AA11080618	use this ratio: 2:1 popcorn to VEGETABLE oil. 1/4c vegetable oil to 1/2c unpopped popcorn kernels. olive oil is not good cause it has a low smoking point. the best way to do it is put the oil in the pan with three kernels, when they start popping add the rest of the kernels and continually move the pot so the heat gets distributed evenly. make sure you also keep the lid on and take if off the heat when the popping has slowed to once every 3-5 seconds.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Read the instructions for making it properly.  If it burns than it sounds like you did not shale the pan well. If it is not popping well than it sound like it is old and time to buy fresh.  I use canola oil since it can take a higher heat than olive oil.

vV1hPhfWaa	The old adage "Sex sells" is actually very accurate.  Moreover, if the Svedka ad uses a fembot in their advertisement then they are targeting a specific audience.  Namely, men.

I take semi-sweet choc chips and melt them either over a double boiler, a glass bowl over a pot filled with water, simmering, not making contact with the glass bowl, or I've even been known to just melt it in the microwave and then dip. you put on a cold baking sheet that you have sprayed with cooking spray or wiped oil onto and then put in the fridge. they come out perfect.

Rn7zkS52aa	well, i've made alot of jello shots in my day. i would usually make a couple different flavors in seperate pans...if anything i use the SAME amount of vodka and water if not slightly more vodka than water. i like mine a little stronger, not so weak. you really can't screw it up though, i'd rather have mine stronger than weak.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	About half and half and you'll be fine. Too much vodka wont allow the jello to set. You can probably get away with 9/16th vodka and 7/16th water, if you feel dangerous.|`|ozcm5WGfaa	<a href="http://liquorlive.com/drinks.php?option=com_drinkdetails&DID=801" rel="nofollow">http://liquorlive.com/drinks.php?option=...</a><br>  <br>  Just follow that recipe and you won't have a problem!|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	use half vodka and half water because if you use too much vodka they wont set up right.

zTLuK65laa	This being your first sleepover, I'm not sure. I have personal experience with this stuff. I am 14, and I have had many sleepovers in my life. I transfered schools once, and my first sleepover in my new school with new friends was when I was 13.<br>  Start the party around 6 or 7...that way you don't have to struggle to find stuff to do.<br>  <br>  Feed your guests as soon as everyone is there. That will take you 45 minutes, maybe.<br>  <br>  Then go and spread out your sleeping bags in an area where no animals, or people, come. You can put out a fun, active board game and you can all play. If you are near to a person sleeping, don't be too loud. If your guests get tired of the game, be a good sport and put it away.<br>  <br>  Start the horror movie. If it is really scary, then you can make jokes about it so it is 'unscary.' While you watch you can gossip, paint your nails, read magazines, etc. When that movie is done, get a mdnight snack. Eat it during the comedy. Your guests may be getting tired or bored with movies. If they are tired, let them sleep. No pressure for an all-nighter. If you don't want to watch the comedy at night, save it for the morning during breakfast. Have 'custom' pancakes. Then treat you and your girls to a fun day out. Go to a spa, or a swimming pool, a park, a movie theatre.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tip: When your guests get bored with something that you aren't bored with, don't fight them, just say, 'Yeah, me too. We can play Truth or Dare?'|`|SUKdrAkGaa	4-5 is a good number, too many girls is no fun at all!  and 7 is a good time to start.  you can have a late dinner when everyone arrives<br>  <br>  just make sure you have lots of food to snack on and a deck of cards.  most of my sleepovers were not planned, we just came up with games to play or ate and talked all night.  doing stuff on schedule is not much fun!  so dont stress and just have fun with your friends!!|`|XfyqdwCdaa	Omg!! you can do alot of things. Well im jana, my idea is that maybe u guys should play some board games and talk about your crushes!!!!That will be super! Or maybe not, since im 13 that seems fun to me! but u should also watch the movie "sleep over" starring: alexa vega>The best food is pizza!! That movie is totally awesometastic!!!to the MAXX. So yeah thats some ideas!! <br>  P.S Happy Early Birffday!!! LOL:) hope u have a total blast!|`|AA11124145	first make ur theme and u can base ur activities off of ur theme here r some themes ill go with a princess them decorate ur room or where ever u guys r gonna sleep at if u go with princess u should do every thing pink|`|J30eP8dGaa	I've had plenty of sleepovers. Definitely you should watch a movie. buy some popcorn and lots of candy so you can stay up late. If you know you won't get in to trouble, maybe prank call someone, thats always REALLY funny if you get someone good. but don't if you will get into trouble. maybe rent a video game to play. i request viva pinata party animals. make sure its party animals because i got the normal viva pinata once and it stunk. a good time for them to come should be around 6 or 7. tell them to come hungry, and make some dough prior to your party so that you can each make your own mini pizza or something. put out some red sauce, pesto, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomatoes, ham, sausage, etc. everytime me and my bff have a sleepover, we make movies. So i dont know if you have access to a video camera or camera or a laptop with a video thing in it, but you should make up movie themes and act. It is SO SO SO much fun!! you can make a movie and commercials and shows and even a  dr. phil show!! Then the next day, maybe you can go to the movies or a mini golf course or an arcade or the candy store. (then when you get back, you can spread all your candies out and trade) try not to stay at home the whole second day of the party.|`|bPZlpe0taa	I would start the sleepover maybe 6? depends if you want them over for dinner first or just let them have their own before they come,it's probably easier on your parents this way. So maybe 6-7 would be a good time :) .<br>  You could get some snacks like popcorn,coke,lollies,chips,that sort of thing but don't have too much sugar,pop in some savoury snacks. You could play truth or dare that's always a good one,hide and seek maybe,listen to music,talk,you will find things to do. The next day maybe go to the movies? or go to some kind of amusement park or beach|`|7810b482021aa21d7006247d38601648aa	i know you feel there is alot of pressure to have the perfect party and i understand because you dont want people to think your party was a dud (thats what we use to call it when i was your age). as for food, i would make tacos because everyone can make their own taco and you dont have to worry about what everyone likes. have all the veggies cut up and in bowls and the meat and beans in a type of warmer and you can keep the chips and taco shells under a heat lamp so they stay warm and everyone can make their own taco or taco salad. my kids like sour cream, so you might want to have alot of sour cream on hand. for desert you can make brownies and maybe have one of your friends help you. just tell everyone your in the kitchen for awhile baking brownies and let your friends just have fun without being there. dont feel like you have to be visible all the time. ask everyone to bring a game or come with an idea to have fun. just let the party flow and dont plan on having an agenda for every minute they are there.  have fun and dont worry.

sqPglTDVaa	Add what you like the taste of.  I don't like really salty soup so I generally don't add a lot of salt when I make it.  You can always add more salt when its time to eat if you don't think its enough.    I usually only add fresh chopped parsley to vegetable soup.  I do like lots of pepper though.|`|gnom5J8Naa	Taste it first and see if it needs anything. If it does I always start with garlic powder and salt. After that maybe Italian seasoning.|`|wLgGD63raa	I personally don't like the taste of rosemary, but most people do and it is a very nice herb to use with vegetables. Thyme is also wonderful, I love thyme. Sage is another good one, as is basil and oregano. <br>  <br>  You can still put salt in with them, just keep tasting until you get it where you want it. Don't over salt though, because you can't take it back out. Salt and pepper go hand in hand, so go ahead and use some pepper as well.<br>  <br>  You can also use some fresh parsley as a garnish, if you have it on hand.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	some rosemary, sage. Thyme.
snBeIxpBaa	I prefer 1% milk.  I've tried various alternatives.. soy milk, rice milk, goats milk, almond milk, dried milk... and so on.<br>  <br>  Soy milk just tastes funky... the viscosity is close.. but never quite right to be exactly like milk.  Some soy milks are fairly heavily fortified with minerals/vitamins.. and all soy milk is fortified with calcium carbonate to provide similar absorbable calcium to cows milk.   (Most calcium naturally in the soybean binds to the bean pulp, making it unabsorbable)<br>  <br>  <br>  Also milk provides complete protein, whereas soy milk only has incomplete.|`|41ea25c1de47169e8d9bfb2fc939bd90aa	Milk is better. too much soy intake is not good for the body.

5zNwBQZHaa	Splenda's generic name is Sucralose.<br>  <br>  Sucralose is derived from sugar through a patented, multi-step process that selectively substitutes three chlorine atoms for three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule. The tightly bound chlorine atoms create a molecular structure that is exceptionally stable.<br>  <br>  The result is about 600 times sweeter than sugar - so only a tiny amount is needed to be as sweet as sugar.  It has no calories and is not digested by the body - meaning it passed out of you unchanged.|`|wFXknE2aaa	I think it has less calories and is made from aspartame.

snBeIxpBaa	You are comparing two entirely different food items.  <br>  <br>  The primary reason some people have trouble digesting lactose is because the ability for the human body to digest it gradually weakens.  Lactase (the enzyme used to break down lactose) is naturally in milk, however during the process of pasteurization, the heat inactivates this enzyme, meaning more work for the body.<br>  <br>  People who are lactose intolerant can still consume milk products from cows, many stores sell lactose-free milk or lactase enriched milk. (AKA: lactase added into pasteurized milk)|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Beef doesn't have lactose.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Milk has a sugar in it called lactose.  Our bodies have an enzyme (lactulase I believe it's called) that breaks down that sugar.  The muscle of the cow (steak, hamburger) does not have the sugar.

AA10636233	Black forest cake<br>  I make a boxed devils food cake mix, then pour into the pan, and take a can of cherry pie filling and drop tablespoons of it all over the top of the cake. Then you bake it as usual. When it is cooled, you will have one of the most delcious and moistest cakes you have ever tasted. I top mine with fresh whipped heavy cream with a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanill mixed in, it is divine! Just a tip though, don't cook this in a metal pan, use a glass one, the metal ones react strangely with the cherries and the food tastes metallic.<br>  Apple dump cake<br>   Take a can of apple pie filling and dump into the bottom of a glass baking dish. Then you pour a yellow boxed cake mix(not prepared, just the dry stuff inside the plastic bag) evenly over the top, then take 2 sticks of  butter and chop into little squares and sprinkle over the top of the cake mix. Bake at 350 until pretty and brown. Tastes awesome, and no one would know it was a boxed cake mix!<br>  <br>  Meatball stroganoff<br>  I use the frozen italian style meatballs that they sell in a bag in the freezer section of the grocery store. I pour them into a crock-pot with 2 cans of campbell's french onion soup and some sliced fresh mushcrooms(I buy them pre-sliced lol). A few hours later after it is good and hot, you add a small tub of sour cream to the mix. Serve over buttered egg noodles with some good crusty bread from the deli.

Happy pizza eating!:)|`|bPZlpe0taa	Depends how long i want to wait,the oven takes longer but it makes it really nice and crispy,the microwave is quicker but tends to make the pizza a bit soggy and soft.

I put it on def for 3 minutes and then high for 30 seconds.You are right about the oven though, a touch of the broiler to bubble the cheese is a good idea too.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	the oven might make it too dry.

To sum up, I drank too much, get that wobbly feeling where the room spins, I think I recover but I don't remember the rest of the night.  Friends have told me that on those occasions that I have said mean or hurtful things, even done things that were out of character.  It hasn't happened for a couple years.  It's honestly pretty scary.  I don't like not having control.<br>  <br>  Now I don't get that drunk anymore.  Sure I might have a few at a party and have a 'buzz' but if I start going down that over-drunk path, I tell one of my buddies "Hey, don't let me drink anymore or I'll get stupid ok?"  They know and they say "You got it.!"  It's good to have friends that way.  So I don't tend to have more than 3 beers in a given night...and I've had no regrets that I've made that decision.

bSVlTvlcaa	How about apple juice and apple cider.  They are similar, but the price varies because cider is fresh, natural pressed juice from apples with nothing added.  It's high perishability makes the price higher.  Apple juice goes through processing, they add water, preservatives, boil etc.. So very little apple juice is used compared to fresh cider so the price is cheaper and much more shelf stable. (4.89 gallon for cider about half that for the juice).

Remember to take the bay leaf out before serving as it can perforate the intestinal wall.  It does add a lovely flavor though.  <br>  As for how much water...  If you use a whole small can of the paste, try starting with 1/2 can water or beef broth.  If you believe you need more liquid, simply add a little at a time. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add a pinch of sugar.<br>  This should work for you.

Add a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in heated water to whipped egg whites for a hard meringue that cuts smoothly.<br>  <br>  Add Piping gel: It helps to stabilize the meringue on pies. Just use about one tablespoon for each three to four egg whites. It helps to keep them from “weeping”.  You can get it at a cake decorating supplier.

British-style marmalade is sweet marmalade with a bitter tang made from fruit, sugar, water, zest and (in some commercial brands) a gelling agent. American-style marmalade is sweet, not bitter. In English-speaking usage "marmalade" almost always refers to a preserve derived from a citrus fruit[1], most commonly oranges. The recipe includes sliced or chopped fruit peel, which is simmered in fruit juice and water until soft; indeed marmalade is sometimes described as jam with fruit peel (although many manufacturers now also produce peel-free marmalade).

Most people associate marmalade specifically with citrus fruits, although it can also be made with other fruits like strawberries. This preserve is sweet from fruit and added sugar, with a hint of tartness from the included rinds. It is popular as a spread for breads and as an ingredient in various foods from desserts to roasts. Many markets carry marmalade, especially in the United Kingdom, and it can also be made at home.|`|HxXduL1maa	Marmalade is a fruit preserve usually made of citrus fruits. British-style marmalade is sweet marmalade with a bitter tang made from fruit, sugar, water, zest and (in some commercial brands) a gelling agent. American-style marmalade is sweet, not bitter. In English-speaking usage "marmalade" almost always refers to a preserve derived from a citrus fruit, most commonly oranges. The recipe includes sliced or chopped fruit peel, which is simmered in fruit juice and water until soft; indeed marmalade is sometimes described as jam with fruit peel (although many manufacturers now also produce peel-free marmalade). Marmalade is most often consumed on toasted bread for breakfast. The favoured citrus fruit for marmalade production in the UK is the "Seville orange", Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, thus called because it was originally imported from Seville in Spain; it is higher in pectin than sweet oranges, and therefore gives a good set. Marmalade can also be made from lemons, limes, grapefruits, strawberries or a combination.<br>  <br>  Orange marmalade is a traditional part of an English breakfast. In fact, it's such an important part of British culture that it gets its own name: "marmalade", rather than just being "orange jam". <br>  <br>  Some like it with chunky peel, some like it with fine peel. The beauty of making it yourself is you get to control all that - and the sweetness.<br>  <br>  And this marmalade recipe is easier to make than most fruit jams. <br>  <br>  The key to a successful marmalade is using Seville oranges (in season from January to March), because these are bitter but much higher in flavour than sweet oranges. <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>   <br>  Ingredients <br>  Makes about 10 x 1lb jars <br>  <br>  <br>  1.5kg Seville oranges<br>  2.5kg sugar (you can use jam sugar for high pectin fruit or ordinary sugar) <br>  Juice of 2 lemons<br>  3 litres water  <br>   <br>    <br>  Method <br>   <br>  Wash the oranges and chop them in half. Scoop out the insides (flesh, pips and pith) with a spoon and place in a muslin cloth. <br>  <br>  <br>  Slice the orange peel as finely or thickly as you like - or you can chop it in a food processor. <br>  <br>  <br>  Put the orange peel, water in a large preserving pan. Tie up the muslin cloth and squeeze any juices into the pan. Then add the muslin to the pan. <br>  <br>  Note: adding the bag is important because the pectin in the seeds and pith help the marmalade to set. <br>  <br>  <br>  Simmer the mixture gently for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the orange peel is soft and only half the liquid remains. <br>  <br>  <br>  Remove the bag.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add the sugar and mix well. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar slowly, stirring often. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bring the marmalade to the boil and boil rapidly for 15 minutes. Then test for a set:<br>  <br>  Testing for a set:<br>  <br>  If you have a suitable thermometer, put it in the middle of the pan. You should have a set when it reads 105C (220F).<br>  <br>  OR: <br>  <br>  Put a saucer into the freezer to cool down.<br>  When you think the marmalade is ready, take the saucer out of the freezer and put about 1/2 teaspoon of marmalade onto the plate.<br>  Allow it to cool.<br>  Push your finger through the marmalade: if it wrinkles, you've got a set.<br>  If not, boil for a further 5 minutes and test again. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When you are happy with the set, let the marmalade cool and remove any scum from the top. Let it settle for 20 minutes and then stir, to make sure the orange peel doesn't rise to the top of the jars when it sets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pot into hot, sterilised jars and cover.<br>  <br>  Note: to sterilise a jar, wash the jar and lid in soapy water and rinse well.

53giV6PFaa	I do this all the time as we like to have leftovers for lunches later on in the week.  I don't do it in batches like another poster stated except for baking cakes, brownies, pies, etc.  You can double cupcake, cookie, and muffins just fine since you are baking them individually.  Just don't double or triple the cooking time.  You may need to cook it a bit longer and sometimes you don't - it really depends on what you are cooking.  Just keep an eye on the cooking, you'll need to test it to see if it's done after the time asked for is done.  Then just increase time in 5 minute intervals until it's cooked completely.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	well.......... just apply maths.

ZeTtadY0aa	The easiest way is to rinse them with water, shake off the excess and place them in a ziploc baggie. Depending on the size of the veggies, microwave between 1 1/2 to 3 minutes.|`|DRKrqAnlaa	Firstly, you must have plenty of water in a  steamer or  a pan and bring it to a boil, then place your cut and rinsed vegetables on a dish over a steaming plate for 6 to 8 minutes depending on their size. This method is recommended for cooking root vegetables and not for green, leafy vegetables as it takes longer than boiling them in hot water for a minute to prevent the loss of vitamin c. Steaming is a healthy method of cooking as it makes food easier to digest and the food can retain all its own flavour.I hope this information is useful.
I54KyS8Laa	Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>   <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm " rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally I'd recommend reading a book to overcome self consciousness as most teenagers are self conscious.

Your body senses that it is starving and actually stores fat (it is an evolutionary survival tool that we still have from when people actually DID starve to death but it DOES still happen). Also you will lose muscle before fat and eventually become weak and cause electron imbalences and risk a heart attack. (This is what I do for a living and it is very sad but eating disorders are the #1 mental issue leading to death). <br>  Now, I'm sure you're not to that point yet but don't even start to go there. It's tough to get out of. I was there (yes I am a man and I was anorexic, it happens) and it is REALLY tough to get out of even with a therapist. <br>  Anyway, to the question about the food. Lean Cusine and other companies make lean type of foods that will fill you up, taste good and won't pack too many calories. It's a good rule of thumb to eat AT THE VERY LEAST 500 calories per meal and at least 2, 100 calorie snacks in between. This would result in you losing about .5-1 lbs per week which is all you want to. Otherwise it is too fast and you will begin to see the effects I stated earlier.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aQLIUizbaa	Choose filling foods, and eat 5 times a day as opposed to three. Breakfast, morning snacks, lunch, afternoon snacks, dinner. Try not to eat after 6:00 pm, and keep your snacks healthy. Ex, an apple, or a banana, granola bars, etc.. And eat slower, too. <br>  <br>  But whatever you do, DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF. Contrary to popular belief, starving yourself does the exact opposite of what you think it does. When you don't eat for a period of time, your body thinks your are starving, so it actually kicks up the fat storage hormone, so what food you eat is more likely to be stored as fat, which is what you don't want.|`|AA11336256	foods with protien,they stay with your body longer and give you more energy,stay away from bread's,noodles,rice.

I was going to build a table with all the caps I had collected but never got around to it. If you use epoxy, I would build it upside down, air trapped under the caps will make them rise while the epoxy is setting otherwise. Get some plywood, half inch thick should be plenty strong. You'll also need some sides to build a trough. measure the plywood to the desired dimensions, cut two identical pieces and cut the four side to fit. The epoxy will take awhile to dry so make the sides only slightly taller than the caps. You'll want to pick up some plastic sheathing to protect the floor ant table from the epoxy. The assembly will go as such: Lay down the plastic on top of one piece of cut plywood. Tack the four sides to the plastic and plywood starting on the plywood side, make sure the plastic is very flat before you start. You now have a wooden frame with a layer of plastic. Mix the epoxy (you'll need quite a bit) and spread a thin layer on the plastic. Lay down your caps, top down. If you want a pattern you can draw it and lay it between the plastic and plywood before you start but your finished product will be the mirror image. After the caps are in place, fill the mold with epoxy up to the top, lay your second piece of plywood on it and screw it to the frame. You should get some epoxy seeping out, wipe it up quickly otherwise its hard to remove. Let it dry for at least a day. Flip it over and remove the plywood you tacked on originally and peel back the plastic. You'll have a shiny flat surface with caps embedded in epoxy and a wooden frame.|`|xdXfRcfGaa	just remember to pay respect to your finished table by using proper cups: ReRack Cups!!|`|vzcib55vaa	Use hot glue.

64a4NB15aa	Miss Anthrope<br>  There is some added nutritional advantage to using steel cut oats , but that is because they are less processed . However they will take longer to cook If you are planning to make oatmeal for breakfast or something . Place the steel cut oats in your crock pot the night before and when you wake up you have oat meal.<br>  Rolled oats are equally good for you . I use them in many recipes .

Toss in some salt and fresh black pepper, and you are done. You might need to pass it through a coarse strainer if the skins are tough.<br>  <br>  But take it really easy using a blender with hot stuff--it will shoot out of the blender and all over you and everyone around you.

(Did they try to scare you by telling you potato is in the nightshade family?  It is - but it generally isn't poisonous) <br>  <br>  The problem with potatoes is what people put on them - fatty cheese, sour cream and butter.  A better alternative is to bake one and cut it open and top it with low-fat or fat-free Italian vinaigrette.   They cook quickly in the microwave and you can cook them ahead and re-heat them or eat them cold.<br>  <br>  You may have heard of a chemical called acrylamide associated with potatoes - that is only for deep fat fried potatoes and you would not be eating them on a diet.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	One a day is fine.|`|AA10413990	I know they aren't low in carbs, so thats not right.

I'm a strawbetty gal.|`|oDhSxINLaa	To answer you question, let us start at the beginning of the sandwich.  Most sandwich scholars agree that the first ever sandwich was made by humans' long extinct relative, Cro Magnon.  This was more than 50,000 years ago.  Cro Magnon were a nomadic people, and their first sandwich was most likely pretty crude by today's standards.  nothing more than two leafs from the native trees Slicedium-Breadianium  with a thin layer of mammoth lard spread on either side and thinly sliced mammoth leg in between.  These primitive sandwiches were the precursor to the food we take for granted in present day and were also served with a pickle spear and potato chips.<br>  <br>  Eons later (less than 3,000 years ago) when cro magnon had gone the wayside, lard of any kind was hard to come by and mammoths had been extinct for years.  Homo sapiens retained their ancestors' affinity for sustenance between two pieces of food (which in no way were to be related to the aforementioned viddles).  Julius Caesar was served the first ever jelly sandwich made using pomegranate preserves made by his most loyal of chefs.  An interesting side not, the roll on which this PBandJ preticesor was created upon was called a Caesar Roll, a name the Germans would eventually butcher and market as today's Kaiser Rolls.<br>  <br>  George Washington Carver invented peanuts in the 1930s.  Shortly after that, a group of white supremacists broke into his laboratory and, thinking they were destroying his livelihood, crushed every last peanut invented peanut butter.<br>  <br>  So now the three pieces of the puzzle have finally been assembled.  It wasn't up until this very moment, reading your question of Yahoo Answers that i would ever imagine putting peanut butter AND jelly together.  In a sandwich no less.  brilliance PURE Brilliance!!!!!|`|Gy8kmB6naa	I LOVE PAENUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH IN NZ WE CALL IT PEANUT BUTTER AND JAM SAMMYZ AND IVE GOT TO GO WITH YOUR BF ON THAT ONE STRAWBERRY JAM|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I think i'd have to say grape|`|AA11218003	I'm with you.

The secret to ending your pain is soluble fiber. Think the fluffy white part of popcorn instead of that hard brown shell. Your digestive tract has a difficult time digesting insoluble fiber, which contributes to many IBS flares. Peppermint and chamomille teas are wonderfully soothing for our stomachs.

rn6gY3vLaa	Your mum is just trying to make sure you eat a healthy diet and to take care of you properly. If you can't eat meat then you really should discuss it with your mum as you might be missing out on some nutrients that you need. Try to research how to eat healthily and then talk it through with your mum. She might take your wishes more seriously with proper information.<br>  My mum started to cook two sets of meals when my big sister became vegetarian (she was 12). It was really stressful for my mum as she knew nothing about vegetarian foods and she did cook some funny things to start with. In the end, we all started to eat a vegetarian diet and I would say that our food was better and more interesting then as we stopped eating a plain meat and two veg diet every day. That was just us though and if you do want to stop eating meat then remember it means more work for your mum so you might need to help out a bit. That might also be why your mum wants you to wait until you are older.|`|6fb01d3ed97075a2983d2d2a21fc7e64aa	LOL..THE PROTEIN MYTH strikes again.<br>  Most small children must be coaxed into eating animal flesh, it's not natural. I seriously doubt your illness was due to lack of "meat".. that is a typical cop-out when they can not figure out what is wrong.  A good well rounded Vegan or Veggie diet does not cause any health problems, in fact usually just the opposite.|`|le0zdEmVaa	Some people had been vegetarian since birth thanks to vegetarian parents.

The best way to make your parents accept this is to not burden them with your new diet.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	I stopped when I was five and haven't eaten any since.

I've been veggie since I was 12, my sister since she was 11- there's no age recommendations at all. Maybe your mum just thinks you should be older so you'll be more inclined to cook your own food. Tell her it's better to have a good veggie diet than a poor meat diet, where you're just not eating the meat. Some people have such strange preconceptions about being vegetarian.|`|na9OvpEwaa	there is no age limit to being a vegetarian. your mom might not be taking you seriosly, or heard a rumor or wives tale about it.

Mostly all that matters is that a Vegetarian gets his/her protein intake and making sure they have omega 3's and 6's in their body.

We like to cook like boil or bake our beans and tofu, etc. (I hate tofu btw-there's so many other foods to choose from besides that!)<br>  Also, in the beginning-you have to LEARN and KNOW what to exactly eat and not eat-so then you'd need like a list to read from to require your intake of certain foods so you dont just fall down. <br>  I hope this helps<br>  If you need anymore help, like quesetions on exactly what to eat so your mom and dad don't flip out...let me know...ill be more than happy to help<br>  xox

As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the Psoas major muscle along the central spine portion, which more or less hangs between the shoulder blade and hip socket. This muscle tissue does very little work, so it is the most tender part of the cow. The tenderloin can either be cut for roasts or for steaks.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	Your question has already been answered. So I'll go off on a tangent. Buy a whole rabbit (skinned and gutted), and you will find three usable pieces of meat. the hind legs have the most meat. The front legs aren't actually attached to the skeleton, and don't have much meat. But they can be thrown in with the other bones for broth. On the outside, and along the backbone, is the loin muscle. Technically it is not tenderloin, because that is on the inside of the rib cage. It is really like a NY strip loin, with a bit of the ribeye loin as well. But for all practical purposes, it is the same as a tenderloin, and it is tender.

Ask for more potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, etc.  visit vegan sites also.   Stand firm on your beliefs.

I know you can do this if you try and don't give up I tried even being a vegan for a week and a half but it was to hard so I went back to vegetarian now I only eat cheese and Eggs but if I do get eggs I only want Egg-lands Best which are I think laid naturally I have not checked out the eggs yet for myself but I will or I only want eggs that are laid from my cousins chickens on her farm because these types of eggs are not speed fed chickens I don't think I hope I helped you out and the best of luck.
kfOpbbCyaa	I get a bit squeamish, myself, especially with something like turkey breast. Though you can probably keep it a bit longer, I generally won't keep it more than a week (usually less for any meat). Normally, though, we'll get a smaller amount that will be gone in around three days. Around here we go by the "better safe than sorry" rule. :)<br>  <br>  Some meats will get slimy while other things will start to smell a bit off (if you know what I mean). ***Cathy is right, though. This isn't a great judge of quality. There have been a few times here when something was forgotten in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks and still seemed fresh, but it was dumped all the same (see my rule above).<br>  <br>  I looked online and found some interesting things.<br>  <br>  According to <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_long_does_lunch_meat_stay_fresh" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_long_does_...</a><br>  "That's going to vary with the source, the packaging, handling and storage temperature.<br>  <br>  "Fresh cut deli meats will only last a few days. Discard them when they start to become slimy or smell yeasty or acidic - that's microbial growth."<br>  <br>  According to this site <a href="http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/yf/foods/fn579-2.htm#Cured" rel="nofollow">http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/yf/foods/fn5...</a> , unopened lunch meats will last two weeks, opened will be good for 3 to 5 days.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	1 week is what I have always been told.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Many 'experts' think you can probably get 10 days out of cold cuts if properly stored (ie: not in the bag you bought it in). For me personally, since I have a huge aversion to being sick in any way, I only would leave deli meats in the fridge LESS than one week, 4 days maximum. The reason for this is because turkey meat and roast beef are usually prepared at deli site. Other deli meats are generally shipped to the deli and have far more sodium, fat and preservatives in them (for example, all Italian cold cuts 'salamis', German 'bierwurst', and bologna). However, for all deli meat it is best to eat them as soon as possible or freeze them immediately after purchasing, ideally in plastic storage bags or plastic containers. <br>  <br>  You should NOT rely on whether something smells good or bad; contamination is not always detectable by smell and/or sight. If you are unsure in any way whether the meat is good or not, toss it. You may lose monetarily, but better that than laying in a hospital bed wanting to 'die' (figure of speech).|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	3 to 5 days,  depending on when the meat was sliced.   You usually don't know how long it's been in the case.  If you want to be sure it's fresh,  ask the deli to slice it fresh for you.  The same with cheese.|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I'm not sure exactly how long, but you can usually tell it's gone bad. It definitely gets a sour kinda smell and also has a slimy feel to it. Probably no more than a week and a half to two weeks.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	If you have a really cold frig, I would say about 6 days. You can also judge if it smells weird.

8CbknQuDaa	PepsiCo traces its origins to 1898 when Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist in New Bern, North Carolina, created a curative drink for dyspepsia called Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi-Cola, later referred to simply as Pepsi, was a mixture of carbonated water, cane-sugar syrup, and an extract from tropical kola nuts. To sell his product, Bradham formed the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1903. In addition to selling the drink at drugstore counters, Bradham bottled Pepsi for sale on store shelves. At this time, bottling was a new innovation in food packaging.|`|zskbhOHeaa	i dont get it...|`|x3CXKalvaa	what do you mean what do you mean from PEPSI?|`|rwdc6mLNaa	I don't understand what you mean.

8lYZROjuaa	Since you're cooking your chicken at 375, it will not hurt the potatoes to cook at that temp.  Put your potatoes in about 15-20 minutes before you put the chicken in the oven, and hopefully they will be done at the same time.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	350 for 1 hour<br>  <br>  If you cook them with a metal skewer through them they will cook faster.    And, you can cook them at a higher temp along with the chicken if you want.    Potatoes are very forgiving in the oven|`|FcZU29W6aa	I usually bake potatoes at 400 degrees for one hour, however, I buy the largest potatoes I can find.  At 375 for medium size, I'd go with one hour, so put them in about 15 minutes before you put the chicken in.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you like a crispy outside of the potato, put a little oil in your hand and rub that over the potatoes before cooking them.  This makes a nice crispy skin on the potatoes but they are nice and soft on the inside.|`|6DMnlrhXaa	I cook mine in the microwave,<br>  <br>  Poke some fork holes around each potato pop in the microwave for 10 minutes then turn them around and cook for another 10 minutes.

For an extra flavor, squeeze fresh lemon juice on top of the veggies when ready to serve.|`|1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	Broccoli Salad:<br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  10 slices bacon <br>  1 head fresh broccoli, cut into bite size pieces <br>  1/4 cup red onion, chopped <br>  1/2 cup raisins <br>  3 tablespoons white wine vinegar <br>  2 tablespoons white sugar <br>  1 cup mayonnaise <br>  1 cup sunflower seeds <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. <br>  In a medium bowl, combine the broccoli, onion and raisins. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar and mayonnaise. Pour over broccoli mixture, and toss until well mixed. Refrigerate for at least two hours. <br>  Before serving, toss salad with crumbled bacon and sunflower seeds. <br>  <br>  For Cauliflower:<br>  <br>  Steam the cauliflower in micro or steamer, then melt velveeta cheese over it.<br>  <br>  For Carrots - family recipe from my grandmother.<br>  <br>  Clean and cut up a small bag of carrots into about 1/4 inch slices. Put them in a pan with a stick of butter, about 4 cloves chopped garlic, small chopped onion, 2 chicken bouillion cubes and enough water to cover the carrots. Bring to a boil, then cut back to simmer and let it all cook until the water is gone and it is reduced to a butter sauce. YUMMMY!!!!|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Try a tasty chicken salad- cube cooked chicken breast and add on top of romaine or fresh baby spinach with your choice of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, red cabbage strips, sliced white mushrooms, lowfat croutons and dressing- a vinaigrette is healthiest- or lowfat ranch/ Caesar<br>  *a great way to make chicken is to place boneless skinless chicken breasts on a pan and coat with a little olive oil, sprinkle salt, pepper and favorite herbs (thyme and rosemary or Italian, garlic powder, lemon/orange zest) and bake at 400 degrees until cooked through (25-45 minutes, depending on the size)<br>  <br>  Make a minestrone soup-<br>  saute chopped onion, zuccini, carrot, celery in olive oil. Add a can of diced tomatoes, 2 cups vegetable broth, a can of red kidney beans or chick peas, drained, Italian herbs, a bay leaf, salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes. Add pasta when done for 8-10 minutes if desired. Voila! And you could serve with a salad, and bread sticks with grated Parmesan cheese on top<br>  <br>  Or a nice stir fry- they sell vegetables separate so you can fry some meat in with them, or get the package with the meat included, or if you don't want meat, add Tofu<br>  <br>  Another great lowfat veggie dish to make is Pad Thai- you can get the sauce packet and noodles in a package then you just add veggies- sticks of carrots, radish, raw zucchinis, bean sprouts, shredded red cabbage, your choice. Add crushed peanuts on top. You can make with tofu (which is delicious) or scramble and egg and add to the top<br>  <br>  You could try a butternut squash soup.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	Try my splatter-fry technique (read it all before starting): <br>  <br>  Get a dry skillet (no oil!) really, really hot, to the point where it isn't smoking anymore. Put some veg's ready to saute (I mean already cut up) in a bowl, and toss with a little bit of oil, just enough to very thinly coat all of them. Throw them into the dry hot pan with a dash of salt, and don't let them sit in one spot for more than 5 or 10 seconds. Toss for about 30 seconds, until there are good brown edges on most of them. <br>  <br>  Put a tight-fitting cover on the pan, but drop in maybe 1/2 cup of liquid first. It will super-steam the veggies and cool the pan down, and they'll be ready to eat in about one minute. If you master this technique, the liquid will be reduced to a glaze (adjust the liquid level if it goes dry too soon, or doesn't reduce all the way down), and you can toss in a bit of butter to make the glaze more tasty. You could also toss in some freshly cracked black pepper at that time too. <br>  <br>  Try changing the liquid from water to chicken broth after you get good at it. You don't want the broth to go dry, it'll ruin everything.<br>  <br>  Veggies to cook this way: carrots, baby corn, green squash, broccoli, baby eggplant, cauliflower, peppers, cabbage, etc.|`|sqPglTDVaa	Stir fried is always good...use a minimal amount of oil and add some stock if you need extra liquid. Soy sauce with a little oyster sauce makes a great sauce. <br>  <br>  Quickly steamed vegies, not cooked until they are limp and colorless, are really good if you add some lemon or lime juice and some freshly cracked black pepper.  <br>  <br>  I like to eat carrot, cucumber and capsicum/bell pepper sliced into sticks with hummus or another low fat dip.|`|ZmSd4CGgaa	i love steamed broccoli i can eat plates of it and it's simple to make. i like to slice cucumbers and eat them with some lemo/salt or even by themselves. you cuold make tomato and onion soup.sorry i'm not too creative but i think those are the most delicious ways to eat them|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	Stir fry.

This is the definition most commonly applied by governments in meat product regulation and food labeling, and in religious rites and rituals.

Why can't God be "she"? -<br>  Woman is the key.  GOD formed Himself--not from a mother, but out of the dark womb of space and said before there was Sun, there was a Woman. The woman is made after the womb out of which God created Himself, and in the woman is the Secret of God, key to kindom of  Heaven or Advance Civilization.<br>  <br>   There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God).

It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that (God) desires for His creation. <br>  <br>  She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.

V58rYfEsaa	If you already like your steak rare,,just cook it the way you usually do,,a good quick searing on either side in a hot char grill pan.<br>  Make sure you rest it for a few min's though before you cut it.|`|1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	Put the oven rack on the second level..not too close to the burner.....put in on Broil....cook 5 minutes on each side...put tin-foil under the steak so you can keep the juice and it doesn't burn the oven...Flip up the sides of the foil!!!
hV43wyvJaa	Lasagna is a very personal experience for cooks. I cannot get the drift of what your question is, but here is my recipe. Maybe this will help. (my ex wife, who hates to complement my cooking, still says this is the best lasagna she has ever had)<br>  <br>  Dean’s Lasagna<br>  <br>  15 ounce container Ricotta Cheese<br>  1 egg<br>  2 T dried parsley<br>  <br>  ? pound lean ground beef<br>  ? pound hot sausage<br>  <br>  12 dried lasagna noodles<br>  <br>  28 ounces of plain spaghetti sauce (home made is preferred)<br>  <br>  2 cups Mozzarella cheese<br>  1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.<br>  <br>  <br>  ? Preheat oven to 350F<br>  <br>  ? Cook lasagna noodles per package instructions to the al dente time. Drain and put on paper towels to absorb excess water<br>  <br>  ? Mix ricotta cheese, egg and parsley together, set aside.<br>  <br>  ? Brown the beef and the sausage until cooked, drain and set aside. It is not necessary to pre-heat the sauce.<br>  <br>  ? In a sprayed 9 x 13 inch casserole dish or a lasagna pan, cover the bottom with about ? cup of the sauce. Lay down, overlapping as needed, 3 noodles. Spread ? of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles. Spread 1/3 of the cooked meat over the ricotta. Spread 1-1.5 cups of the spaghetti sauce. Spread ? cup of the Mozzarella, and a shaking to taste of the Parmesan.<br>  <br>  ? Repeat layers: noodles, ricotta, meat, sauce, cheeses, 2 more times, using up all the ricotta and meat in the third layer.<br>  ? Make 1 more layer of noodles, use all the rest of your sauce, and all the rest of the mozzarella and Parmesan on top.<br>  <br>  Note: Lasagna making is not an exact science. A little more or less of this or that only makes a difference to the cook, not the customer.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	There is no white sauce in lasagna - there is cheese, that is the white layer.  Flour and milk?  That doesn't belong in lasagna either.<br>  <br>  To keep the top layer of pasta from burning - you cover it in sauce OR you cover the entire pan with foil until the last bit of baking where you uncover it, add cheese and allow it to melt and brown before serving.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	To stop the bottom layer of pasta burning, put a thin layer of the Bolognese sauce in the bottom of the ovenproof dish. Cover with a layer of the pasta sheets. Then another layer of Bolognese sauce. Then a layer of cheese sauce. Then pasta, then Bolognese sauce, then cheese sauce. <br>  <br>  However many layers you end up with, they must finish with a layer of cheese sauce on top. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top.|`|53giV6PFaa	Don't top with the white sauce.  I just top the last sheet of pasta with red sauce, meat and shredded cheese. Cover with foil for the first half of cooking.<br>  <br>  I also don't use milk at all in my lasagna.  Milk may burn easily, I'm not sure.  But definitely don't put it on top.  My ricotta mixture is ricotta, egg, black pepper, and parmesan cheese.|`|nOVSf06Raa	use a bit of sauce at the bottom of the pan cover the lasagna with foil and place in the middle of the oven bake at 350F the white sauce or Bechamel is to be used in between the layers and not as a base , for that use the tomato sauce .|`|YwcIGtK4aa	I only ever use the flour/milk mix (i assume you mean white sauce) the top of the top sheet of pasta. I use it on the bottom layer as well to stop it from sticking. <br>  <br>  Then I put grated chedder cheese and parmesen cheese over the top, crispy and deadly. You can mix mozarella with the cheese too to make it kinda chewy too. <br>  <br>  There are so many recipes for lasange its deadly, and every family has their own. The one I make is my mother's one which I have added to as well.|`|v4f1oqOCaa	to make a proper "stuffing" as my  grandma would call it, im assuming here you are calling it white sauce.. you need ricotto cheese and an egg.  thats it unless your feeling creative then you can add some fresh basil and oregano. if you do not like ricotta cheese you may substitute cottage cheese, but make sure to drain it before you start mixing it with the egg.  <br>  <br>  the top layer on your lasagna should be red sauce that covers and completely seals in the noodles.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Buy fresh Lasagne instead of the hard sheets, most supermarkets do it these days and then it does not take so long in the oven so the sheets shouldn't burn.<br>  <br>  I take it u mean flour and milk for the cheese sauce?? Thats what i would do.<br>  <br>  Remeber to finish with meat and then justsprinkle with cheese<br>  <br>  xx|`|aTRMObTZaa	Yep.. what Noah said.<br>  <br>  That's actually the reason why Chicago Deep Dish pizza has it's sauce on the top - it's so thick, the cheese would burn before it's completely cooked, so they put the sauce on top. :)|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	well the white sauce is riccotta cheese  and add some sauce and then cheese on the top layer cover for 45 mins with aliumin foil and then remove and put back in the over so the cheese can light brown

440baeb925e1ff23c844737e333e0a7caa	The theory of drinking through a straw was meant to be for beer not shooters, it just got twisted. When you chug beer through a straw it does not digest with your saliva, as well as the lack of oxygen, it forces your stomach muscles to release and opens the sphincter to your liver making all your liquids flush into your liver making you more intoxicated...|`|10cc347f950f894f18f6742a8916032baa	well it has to do with home much air you get when u drink through a straw. When u put you straw into your drink there is air in the straw so when u suck up on the straw you swollow the air that was in the straw. I think that has a big thing to do with it|`|420bb6228fc44b259e555aa460c9dfcbaa	It could be that by sucking down quickly through a straw  the small amount of alcohol isn't diluted by your saliva. Like drinking on an empty stomach,the liquor is quicker.|`|AA11588385	I really doubt it makes a difference, as your body (your liver.....) only works so fast, and I believe it's 1 ounce of alcohol per hour anyway, regardless of ingestion method.|`|b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	I don't think this is true if you're talking about a single shooter.  If you're talking about multiple shooters, maybe drinking it through a straw lets you drink it more slowly, making it more palatable, and you end up drinking more.

e00935edad1715c2b7d62087ae2f2f28aa	I don't know of any real 100% natural fruit juices. The major problem that most people are not aware of is that when a fruit of vegetable is juiced it quickly loses it's nutritional benefits. By the time it gets to the store, it is a dead food. Basically flavored water. Even the flavor is artificial because of all the garbage that is added to "retain flavor" or keep it fresh. Even the "100%" fruit juices are not 100%. Read the label. I have read so many labels and found none that are truly real fruit juice. The FDA allows them to do this. My suggestion would be to obtain a juicer and make your own. Once you taste fresh juice you will realize that the store stuff is garbage.|`|1c4dba4718dcf5821f98a4a352e3a633aa	Florida's Natural and Juicy Juice offer only 100% juices.  Most other brand of juice now offer 100% (no-sugar or artificial sweetener added) juices as well, but they are generally more expensive than the "regular" stuff.<br>  <br>  As for "fruit juice waters"... I'm not really sure that there are any that are 100% natural, because they are all artificially flavored as far as I know.  If you are looking for fairly healthy alternatives to juice and soda, I recommend Honest Tea.  They use only real sugar or honey as sweeteners, and are only very slightly sweetened at that.   And they offer several tasty flavors including green tea and peach oolong.|`|05b3e68a5b0f56fa826441c56ff6231caa	Naked is a fruit juice brand thats 100% fruit and its so good! It's a little more expensive then your typical tropicana but it's a lot healthier and natural.
wLgGD63raa	Just keep it in the fridge. Temperatures between 41-135 degrees are known as the temperature danger zone. This is when pathogens that cause food-borne illnesses grow the best. If you leave your meat on the counter to thaw, you'll have millions of bacteria on your food by the time you cook, and at that point the cooking process won't get rid of all of them.<br>  <br>  By thawing on the counter you run the risk of getting sick, you're much better thawing it on the bottom shelf of your fridge. You use the bottom part of your fridge to thaw the meat so you don't contaminate other foods, such as fruits and veggies and other ready to eat foods with the meat's blood or what have you. <br>  <br>  You can also thaw it by running cold tap water over it or thawing it during the cooking process, any of these are acceptable.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Everyone will say don't do it.<br>  <br>  But I still do it from time to time. Stuff can take up to 2 days to thaw in thefridge so plan in advance.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	You can, but not in the sun, but it is better if you have the time, do it in the fridge.|`|MhfneF0xaa	No! Never thaw meat (or anything else) at room temperature. <br>  <br>  For a quick thaw, submerge in cold water for a while, keeping the water changed to keep it cold.<br>  <br>  This is like thawing in the refrigerator, but using water as a heat transfer medium instead of air. Water is many, many times denser than air, so it is much faster than refrigerator thawing.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	Naw man,that ain't a good idea no more,don't know how people got away with that in the old days,just lucky I rekon !,I let it thaw in the frige and just have a pot pie or something if in a hurry !|`|ILZY7BD0aa	Well people have put it in the sink for years.. But now a day's everyone says to thaw meat in the bottom part of the refrigerator.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	It will thaw, however, if I were you, and from my experience in cooking, I'd wait for a less thaw time rather than 24hrs (which isn't safe if it's beef to have it out that long), and put it in COLD water to thaw from your tap.  Make sure the package is sealed tightly or double bag it in quart sized baggies, so the cold water does not get in.   You will be very very amazed just how quick cold water thaws meat.  <br>  <br>  Good luck now!!|`|6azfzZ6Taa	It is not okay to let meat thaw on the counter at room temperature.<br>  If you have the time, do it in the refrigerator.<br>  If not, I do it in the sink. But...the meat must be in its packaging still and the water in the clean sink must be cold. That means you should change the water every 30 minutes or so to keep it from getting too warm. This method should take about an hour for a pound of meat. (2 hours=2LB of meat, etc.)|`|Nqbn7ZeUaa	it isnt good to put it on the counter because you are bringing the temperature to the "danger zone" where bacteria can grow. It is better to run in under cold water. It is also the fastest way. Just don't put it on the counter. It can be very dangerous|`|Gy8kmB6naa	Yes you can leave meat on the bench to thaw out....depending on when you are eating it....if you are eating it that day you can leave it on the bench if your eating it the next day day put it in the fridge|`|Yl8JZrataa	Unfreeze or thaw in the fridge. <br>  <br>  Keeps the meat fresher, and keeps the bacteria and oder down.<br>  <br>  And it won't take very long.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Any fruit and many vegetables, flowers, etc. can be used but I doubt that the coconut water will add anything to the wine. However, you never know. You might start with a recipe that requires boiling the base vegetable, rather than juicing it. Potato wine is one that comes to mind. Just substitute coconut water for the water you boil the potato in.|`|eDxOYT94aa	Wine is a beverage that contains fermented fruit sugars. Traditionally the best wine is made from grapes.<br>  Coconuts are high in oil so it is unlikely that any fruit that you add will improve the drink to make a good wine.<br>  If your going to do this you'll need a fruit with high natural acid levels, like passionfruit, kiwi etc. however I'd suggest the traditional coconut mixer of coconut milk and rum (Malibu)

Think of it like water with nutrients in it. It enhances your concentration and stamina. The drink is also perfect for those whom think their diet is not perfect because lemonade drinks are specifically made to benefit your body. <br>  <br>  The taste also is great. Nearly all of lemonade vitamin water (that i know of) contain pure water in it that helps you better enhance your bodily functions.<br>  <br>  No matter if it be lemonade water or even orange water, they all have similar benefits but only the great tastes differ...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
7w6HF0htaa	Smirnoff vodka consists of distilled alcohol diluted with purified water, both of which take very very very long time to go "bad"<br>  <br>  other types of alcohol that is not distilled like wine or beer, go bad more quickly because there's still yeast inside and because it doesn't have enough alcohol concentration to have a strong preserving power.<br>  <br>  other drinks (coolers, malt beverage, etc) that contain miscellaneous flavorings or juice can go bad quicker depending on the ingredients<br>  <br>  so if its just the smirnoff vodka you are talking about, and it has never been opened, i think you should be ok.<br>  <br>  smirnoff ice products?  well i wouldn't take a chance with that.|`|7044ecc379ee487d11ad752578ed77f1aa	I wouldn't drink it if I were you! Chances are you'll get sick...it does expire, whether it's got alcohol in it or not!<br>  And to the person above, actually wine does expire, if you don't have it sealed. Red wine is supposed to be consumed up to 3 days after opening! We had a bottle sitting on the wine rack (opened) that we forgot about, and it went mouldy inside. Also I drink Smirnoff and a bottle left outside went mouldy...so do the safe thing and throw it out!!|`|kKwmeOXdaa	no the punch will still be there alcohol gets stronger with age, it wont be flat cause its not carbortated and it wont make you sick the worst thing that will happen is it wont taste as good|`|f4f8ee4adea4d4f3fcee3fa3ae34ef56aa	Go ahead and drink it, shouldn't be bad, alcohol can sit for YEARS untouched an still be fine...<br>  <br>  after all wine is aged to perfection...|`|AA11615501	Smirnoff will taste expired even when it's brand new.  If you like cheap liquor then drink up.  If you have to ask a question like this when it comes to drinking or eating something, you should always rule on the side of caution.  Nothing is worth getting sick over.  Smirnoff is wrot gut liquor and you could probably get a gallon of that stuff for under 17.00 u.s.  Toss it and go get yourself a 12 pack of fresh beer!|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Smirnoff isn't carbonated (well, those flavored "ice" drinks might be...) so it won't be flat no matter what. Generally unopened bottles or cans of just about anything don't expire, so as long as you drink all of it within a few days of opening it should be okay.

bO9p8Kxdaa	That is probably ok.  Sometimes acid will react with metal pans, but since yours is coated it will work ok|`|WqmnQNp6aa	No, the acid in the vinegar will etch into its surface.  You will need either stainless steel, or maybe corningware - pyrex glass will also work.|`|6e5a57787c3f60d43faa7cb6bcd04815aa	One should throw away all their aluminum pans since it has been proven that the aluminum leeches into just about everything you cook in it and causes slow aluminum poisoning which mimics the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.(This part is from me)    Reactive Pan - is one made from a material that reacts chemically with other foods. Aluminum and copper, metals that conduct heat extremely well, are the 2 most common reactive materials used to make in cookware.    Lightweight aluminum, second only to copper in conducting heat, reacts with acidic foods, imparting a metallic taste, and can discolor light-colored soups and sauces, especially if you stir them with a metal spoon or whisk (it is a very soft metal). For that reason, you should neither cook nor store light-colored foods in aluminum cookware. Anodized aluminum has a hard, corrosion-resistant surface that helps prevent discoloration.    Most copper pots and pans are lined with tin to prevent reaction. However, tin is a very soft metal, so it scratches easily and then exposes foods to the copper underneath.    Non-Reactive Pan: When a recipe calls for a non-reactive cookware, use clay, copper, enamel, glass, plastic, or stainless steel. Stainless steel is the most common non-reactive cookware available. Since it does not conduct or retain heat well, it frequently has aluminum or copper bonded to the bottom or a core of aluminum between layers of stainless steel. Although expensive, this kind of cookware offers the benefits of a durable, non-reactive surface and rapid, uniform heat conductivity.    Glass cookware is non-reactive and although it retains heat well it conducts it poorly. Enamelware is non-reactive as long as the enamel is not scratched or chipped. Cast-iron is considered reactive; however, we have to say that our extremely well-seasoned pans seem to do fine with tomato sauce and other acidic foods as long as they do not stay in contact with one another for extended periods.

A.A. is for quitters|`|pG6yaNC2aa	From what i learned in my abnormal psychology (college) class i was told if it interferes with their daily life they are considered to have a problem.  For example, if they get drunk on week nights and that causes them to be late for work, they may have a potential problem.  I believe someone could have a problem if they get drunk alone frequently, and its not for fun anymore.  Also if you can't remember the last time you saw them and they wern't drinking.  I believe the official definition i learned in class though was when i begins to interfere with their daily life.|`|6bc8356604557667c776ceb4e4a5935aaa	its very difficult im afraid but normally they don't go a day without a drink some like myself can drink a whole bottle of whiskey and people will think he,s Only had a couple of pints but usually when they start to drink they don't no when to stop if they were in a bar and there was a bomb scare or a fire they would not leave there drink after a wile they start to get agitated in drink and not enjoying it that's the first signs then it just goes from bad to worse waking up in the morning needing a drink to stop shaking hiding booze all over the place not that your bothered that people know that your drinking but to make sure you get it all bbelieveme i,ve been there and it,s a horrible dark place to be but thankfully there is help out there all it takes is a phone call to aa and they will explain better than i can but they cant cure you that's down to the alcoholic and sadly once you reach the final stages there's no days of for good behaviour iv,e been sober 6 years now but i know that if i pick up a drink i,ll be of again to that dark place<br>  <br>  addtional information <br>      better to be a live healthy quitter than a gibbering incohearant hard man|`|J0G4lRrNaa	1.

The product was probably produced a year or so ago so the company says it will be out of code on Feb 21, 2009 -- but you could have opened it in April 2008 -- got it?

Makes 2 servings.       1. Remove the squids intestines     2. Wash and drain the squid. Cut it into strips (about 2-3 cups worth) and place them in a bowl.     3. Prepare a big plate for your vegetables.     4. Cut a carrot thinly and diagonally and place it on a big plate.     5. Cut 12 green onions into pieces 5-7 cm in length and put them on the plate.     6. Slice 1 medium size onion and put it on the plate.     7. Slice 1 green chili pepper and put it on the plate.     8. Prepare a small bowl and make hot paste by mixing 5 cloves of minced garlic, 2? tbs of soy sauce, 2 tbs hot pepper flakes, and 1 tbs sugar.     9.

Sprinkle some sesame oil and transfer to a serving dish and serve with rice.|`|PenbhD1uaa	This is an awesome recipe.  I never have leftovers. I'm making it for Superbowl too.    5 cups dried black beans (two 1-pound packages) (makes 12 cups cooked beans)    4 dried ancho chiles         ? cup olive oil    3 cups minced yellow onion (one large or two medium-large onions)    two 14?-ounce cans crushed tomatoes (about 4 cups)    1? cups diced green bell peppers    ? cup stemmed, seeded and deribbed, minced jalapeno chiles      4 cloves garlic, peeled, and minced or pressed         2 tablespoons dried cumin seed    2 tablespoons dried oregano    1? tablespoons ancho chile powder (or sweet paprika)    ? teaspoon red pepper flakes (or more if you want a hotter brew)    ? teaspoon ground cinnamon    ? teaspoon ground cloves         2 cups chicken or vegetable broth    ? cup fresh lime juice    2 teaspoons salt (you will probably want to use more, as black beans require a lot of salt)    freshly ground black pepper         Required Garnish    ? pound jack or cheddar cheese, grated    ? cup sour cream    1 lime, cut into 8 wedges    8 sprigs cilantro         Optional Garnish    ? cup chopped tomato    ? cup chopped green bell pepper    ? cup chopped red, yellow, or orange bell pepper    ? cup chopped jalapeno chile pepper    ? cup chopped green onion    ? cup chopped red onion    ? cup chopped cilantro    ? cup chopped dry roasted peanuts          1.    Sort through the beans and remove any irregular looking ones. Rinse well. Place beans in a large non-reactive (stainless steel or enamel) soup pot or stovetop casserole and add cold water to cover by 3 inches. Then, cover and let hydrate for 8-12 hours; or bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and let hydrate for 1 hour.    2.    Drain the beans and rinse well, add to a clean soup pot, add cold water to cover by 3 inches, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 1? hours or just until tender. While simmering, add more water to keep the beans covered by 3 inches.    3.    When the beans are tender, strain them in a large bowl, reserving all of the liquid. As the liquid settles, pour the lighter liquid on top off to a separate container.    4.    Put the ancho chiles in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Let hydrate for 15 minutes, then stain the water into a small saucepan and reduce to 1 cup of liquid. Core the chiles and remove the seeds. Chop finely. You will have about 1/3 cup of chile paste.    5.    In a large soup pot or stovetop casserole, add the olive oil and slowly cook the onions until soft and translucent, about 15 minutes.    6.    Meanwhile, in a small, nonstick saut pan, heat the oregano and cumin for several minutes over medium-high heat, until the fragrance is toasty but not burnt. Add the paprika, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and cloves, and then add the mixture to the onions. Saut for 2 minutes.    7.    Add the ancho chiles, 1 cup of reduced chile liquid, tomatoes, green bell peppers, jalapeno chiles, and garlic to the soup pot. Simmer slowly for 10-15 minutes to meld the flavors.    8.    Add the cooked black beans, 2 cups of the thicker black bean liquid, and the chicken stock.    9.    Adjust the consistency of the chili by adding additional cup increments of the thicker black bean liquid, adding the remaining thinner liquid only if necessary. For this recent batch of chili, I used a total of seven cups of liquid (counting the stock, chile soaking liquid and black bean cooking liquid).      10. Add the lime juice, and season to taste with additional salt and freshly ground black pepper.    11. To serve, ladle 2 cups of hot chili in each heated soup bowl. Put a spoonful of sour cream on top of each bowl of chili and sprinkle with cheese. Nestle a sprig of cilantro in the sour cream. If desired, surround the chili with small bowls of each of the optional garnishes and let guests help themselves.
1zNfZEDdaa	yeah technically they're fakes.<br>  A vegetarian who eats chicken and fish is called Semi-vegetarian<br>  Someone who eats just chicken is called Pollotarian, <br>  Someone who eats just fish is Pescatarian,<br>  <br>  And someone who eats hamburger every once in a while is a (slang term) Flexitarian....<br>  none of these are really vegetarians... but they like to think of themselves that way.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Vegetarians do not eat any animals, and no byproducts of slaughter.  They do not discriminate against any species as being more edible than another.  Someone who eats just birds,  or just fish,   or just cows,  or just horses,  or just dogs,  or just apes,  or just camels,  or just kangaroos,  or just emus,  or just kittens,  or just manatees,  or just raccoons------  is not a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  The Vegetarian Society in the UK states, "We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products."|`|lHlFxeaCaa	A chicken and a fish is classified as an animal, and as a Vegetarian cannot eat an animal, your brother and mother are not Vegetarians. Your mother is a Polo-Pescatarian while your brother is just a poser, no offense though. If you cannot control yourself from eating a hamburger just from seeing them then I'm quite sure your brother is on a constant frenzy of animal devouring.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for those two Polo and Pesca aren't really considered vegetarians of any sort. It completely contradicts the movement.|`|AA11767076	They are both carnivores!<br>  Vegetarians do not eat anything that has (or had) eyes (or any body parts)<br>  Chicken is meat & so is fish.|`|entB7tPQaa	No. No no no.<br>  Haha sorry but TRUE vegetarians get annoyed by this.<br>  Fish and chickens are animals.<br>  Both are abused in the meat industry,<br>  Both feel pain.<br>  Both want to live.<br>  <br>  They are meat. People just twist everything around so they can say they're something good while still eating what ever the hell they want. I'm a true vegetarian, I don't eat anything that is white meat, red meat, fish, or even eat anything with gelatin, etc.<br>  Both of your family members are totally fake.|`|EJ94sMyCaa	no. vegetarians no eat meat. meat is dead animal. chicken is dead animal. vegetarian no eat chicken.<br>  <br>  see... cavemen can understand the concept. why cant you?|`|GGmgXUhbaa	No because if your a vegetarian then you don't eat meat of any kind.<br>  Yes your step brother is also a fake.|`|AHJLrr2Faa	No cuz u cant eat meat at all|`|AA11534382	People often point to some food item and ask me, “Can you eat this?” My answer is always “Sure, I can eat whatever I want.” I choose not to eat certain things. When deciding what type of vegetarian you want to be, think about what you want to include or avoid. You don’t need to fit into one of these categories, but understanding them will help you think about your short-term and long-term goals. <br>  <br>  1. Pescatarian (also spelled pescetarian)<br>  <br>  The word “pescatarian” is occasionally used to describe those who abstain from eating all meat and animal flesh with the exception of fish. Although the word is not commonly used, more and more people are adopting this kind of diet, usually for health reasons or as a stepping stone to a fully vegetarian diet. <br>  <br>  2. Flexitarian/Semi-vegetarian<br>  <br>  You don’t have to be vegetarian to love vegetarian food! “Flexitarian” is a term recently coined to describe those who eat a mostly vegetarian diet, but occasionally eat meat. <br>  <br>  3. Vegetarian (Lacto-ovo- vegetarian)<br>  <br>  When most people think of vegetarians, they think of lacto-ovo-vegetarians. People who do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fish, shellfish or animal flesh of any kind, but do eat eggs and dairy products are lacto-ovo vegetarians (“lacto” comes from the Latin for milk, and “ovo” for egg). <br>  <br>  Lacto-vegetarian is used to describe a vegetarian who does not eat eggs, but does eat dairy products. <br>  <br>  Ovo-vegetarian refers to people who do not eat meat or dairy products but do eat eggs. <br>  <br>  4. Vegan<br>  <br>  Vegans do not eat meat of any kind and also do not eat eggs, dairy products, or processed foods containing these or other animal-derived ingredients such as gelatin. Many vegans also refrain from eating foods that are made using animal products that may not contain animal products in the finished process, such as sugar and some wines. There is some debate as to whether certain foods, such as honey, fit into a vegan diet.<br>  <br>  5. Raw vegan/Raw food diet<br>  <br>  A raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius). “Raw foodists” believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body. <br>  <br>  6. Macrobiotic<br>  <br>  The macrobiotic diet, revered by some for its healthy and healing qualities, includes unprocessed vegan foods, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and allows the occasional consumption of fish. Sugar and refined oils are avoided. Perhaps the most unique qualifier of the macrobiotic diet is its emphasis on the consumption of Asian vegetables, such as daikon, and sea vegetables, such as seaweed.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	The clue's in the name: "vegetarian".

5zNwBQZHaa	If you don't know what is a carbohydrate - you have no clue if you are eating too many carbs or not - how would you know.<br>  <br>  You need to either educate yourself on nutrition - or ask someone who can evaluate your entire diet in order to determine how many carbs you are taking in and what your requirements are.<br>  <br>  Until that point - you should not go on a low-carb diet.  You should not make blind decisions on your diet - you could mess yourself up for years to come.|`|AA11737190	Lentils are a great source of protein.

It would be quite hard for a human to live without carbs, though we could, as it is our main energy supply. But like all food, if you eat more than your body can sustain you'll pay the consequences. <br>  <br>  I basically only eat carbohydrates, all day. Though their not simple, so they're healthy. Anyways my body can sustain the amount I eat without I in return becoming fat. <br>  <br>  So I suggest avoiding simple and gearing towards complex, but only eat as much as you can sustain.<br>  <br>  Umm for your dinner suggestion...wheat spaghetti with mushroom spaghetti sauce, with kidney beans and spinach. I eat that almost every night.

Then I take fresh spinach and toss it into the same pan with the mushrooms and onions. Turn them over and over again so that they wilt in the pan and are well combined with the first two ingredients.  Next take the breasts and pound them between two sheets of waxed paper with  a meat mallet, or a heavy pot.  when they are fairly wide and thin, you roll a long thin chunk of white cheese(I use monterrey jack)and part of the mushroom/spinach mixture up inside the breast. Secure the edges with toothpicks so it doesn't just pop back open. Repeat with the remaining breasts, and then roll them in a mixture of freshly ground pepper and salt (this shouldn't be a lot, it should look speckled). Next, you heat some oil in an oven safe pan and brown the breasts turning a lot until all sides are golden.

Proteins will become denatured and not as usable by the body. <br>  <br>  Of course there will still be some nutrients, but it will be much healthier untoasted. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to toast the bread, cheese and meat then add the veggies.|`|hV43wyvJaa	the inside of the sandwich will not experience the high heat of the toasting, and will therefore not lose many nutrients.... go for it|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Certainly not!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|aKkDWz5Waa	not all its nutrients, but the vegetables will definitely be affected (they will lose nutrients)<br>  <br>  i suggest toasting the sandwich without the vegetables, then putting them in, or if u wanna toast them, make sure u also have portions of raw vegetables throughout ur day|`|PN7XMglOaa	No way , Chris .

fEBOzWeXaa	I would add a bit of cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch and maybe bump up the garlic somewhat.  I have never tasted store bought but the place I work at makes delicious hummus and it has a kick to it and judging from all the folks that buy it, we must be doing something right.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	My wife is lebanese and we make this recipe all the time.    Note that Cumin is not in the basic recipe although, sometimes I add cumin, roasted peppers or sundried tomatoes to make a unique flavor.     Normally, we make it with the following recipe. <br>  <br>  <br>  2 cans chick peas<br>  <br>  1 /2 cup tahini<br>  <br>  1/4 cup lemon juice<br>  <br>  2 cloves garlic chopped and mashed with 1 teaspoon salt<br>  <br>  2 tablespoons olive oil<br>  <br>  Water to thin to taste<br>  <br>  <br>  Put all ingredients in a food processor and puree while scraping down sides.    Add small amounts of water to thin to desired consistency.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hints......<br>  <br>  Mashing fresh garlic with salt heightens the garlic flavor and is significantly better than garlic powder or salt<br>  <br>  Some recipes call for slightly more than the 1/4 cup lemon juice I add.    You can increase it slightly if you like it more lemony<br>  <br>  I find that adding water is usually necessary to get it to the right consistency.   Otherwise it is very thick.   <br>  <br>  I do not use pepper<br>  <br>  Extra virgin olive oil is a must<br>  <br>  Get good quality tahini.    I buy mine from a middle eastern grocer.    I am not a big fan of most store brands.    This can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  After you make it, float some olive oil on top to serve it.|`|uT44Ae03aa	Most commercial hummus I have had is way too salty and has MSG or other free glutamate. Those two things will probably make it taste more like the over-priced stuff. In terms of homemade hummus I usually include cayenne and paprika as well and don't use tumeric or oregano. Roasted garlic will drastically change the flavor. Roasting garlic the "right" way is a little messy. I reccomend during your experimentation to just put some peeled raw cloves on a pan with some olive oil and stick it in the oven at 350 F until they are soft enough to mash with a fork. It gives you a flavor close to what you need. It makes the garlic sweeter instead of hot and sharp like raw garlic.|`|KT0UTX8taa	MISS LYNN'S HUMMUS  <br>  <br>  1 16oz can chick peas<br>  1/2 cup sesame seeds<br>  3 tbsp lemon juice<br>  1 clove garlic<br>  cayenne pepper to taste<br>  black pepper to taste<br>  parsley to taste<br>  <br>  1.

They are usually peeled, coated in flour, pepper and salt, sometimes pounded flat, then deep-fried. This delicacy is most often served as an appetizer.[1]<br>  <br>  It is a well-known novelty dish in parts of the American West and the Canadian Prairies where cattle ranching is prevalent and castration of young animals is common ("prairie oysters" is the preferred name in Canada, where they may be served in a demi-glace, not deep-fried)[2]. In Oklahoma and North Texas, they are sometimes called calf fries but only if taken from very young bulls. [3]. In Spain and many parts of Mexico they are referred to as "criadillas" and are colloquially referred to as huevos del toro (literally, "bull’s eggs" but huevos is also a Spanish slang term for testicles) in Central and South America.[4] Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes confused with lamb fries or animelles (lamb testicles), which are served in a manner similar to Rocky Mountain oysters. A few other descriptive terms, such as "cowboy caviar," "Montana tendergroins," or "swinging beef," may be used.[5]<br>  <br>  The dish, purportedly cowboy fare[6], is most commonly found served at festivals, such as the ones in Montana and Phoenix, Arizona, amongst ranching families, or at certain eating establishments and bars.[5] Eagle, Idaho, claims to have the "World's Largest Rocky Mountain Oyster Feed" during its Eagle Fun Days (typically the first weekend in June).[7] Usually this meat product is sold frozen, as it is inconvenient to get them fresh.[8]<br>  <br>  The primary goal of testicle removal is not necessarily culinary. Castration in veterinary practice and animal husbandry is common and serves a variety of purposes, including the control of breeding, the growth of skeletal muscle suitable for beef, and temperament alteration.[9]|`|u4liwDhAaa	Yes, they are animal testicles.  And, I do not recommend them.  Been there, done that, and it was awful!!!|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Yes. As everyone said - they are testicles.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Pigs testicles.

Definitely not for the faint of stomach!|`|xayYdIfHaa	Yup. It's bull testicles, breaded usually and fried.<br>  <br>  They can also be called Prarie Oysters. I've never tried them but heard they're actually quite tasty.
f2d9c213ef900a74f5759771f3fb61a7aa	I was already into Animal rights before PETA existed but the appeal they had was because of the Real Dedication of it's founders and workers .<br>  <br>  I was just writing someone about this so I hope you don't mind me giving you a copy of what I had just written:<br>  <br>  PETA has literally saved thousands and thousands of Animals in Their  28 years .<br>  <br>   In the US it is one of the Major groups still behind the scenes negotiating with Congress to change laws regarding animal treatment . Below are some of their accomplishments , but on of the biggest is NOT mentioned  below and I was there to bear witness ..<br>  <br>  In the late 90's at a PETA gala in NYC I attended , The CEO of Colgate/Palmolive spoke to the group . He said PETA had come to him and showed him undercover footage of animal testing that was taking place in the labs he was using to test his products . He said "I had nightmares , I was horrified after watching the footage " and then continued to explain that Colgate/Palmolive will Stop testing on animals immediately and will look to alternatives . He added that He and PETA  would also join in working with Congress to find alternatives to animal testing . Since then Colgate /Palmolive HAS lived up to their word and HAS NOT tested on animals  the products that were not required by law. The reason they are not on the good list is threefold , one they still use animal ingredients in some of their products ,two they still do test a small amount , and three they will not pledge to never test again . None the less this alone saved thousands upon thousands of animals .<br>  <br>  Congress has been slower , but has made some changes, eliminated experiments by accepting non animal alternatives and continues to look for alternatives .( as expressed by the NIH this year)<br>  <br>  PETA is not just what you see in their controversial ads ( which is their point ..to get people talking and nothing more)<br>  <br>  They have more influence in Congress behind the scenes then any other animal rights group .<br>  <br>  <br>  I was also their when the Head Bashing Lab at the University of PA was closed for good due to PETA ( Crash dummies became the alternative!!)   This plus , Alex Pacheco  (a founder of PETA) locked himself inside a new GM car at the annual car show and got media attention by refusing to get out of the car and placing a banner in the rear window . GM was using the head bashing primates lab to test their cars  . This was one of the numerous times, Alex,  was forcibly removed and went to Jail to help animals , but he got the LAB shut down permanently  !<br>  <br>  PETA does a lot of behind the scenes and undercover work at farms and labs . You would be amazed . Their workers have gone to jail more times then you can count to help animals .....and PETA has made this country know the word animal rights ,<br>  <br>  These are a few of my personal reasons .. I know about the PETA trial and the two employees who Euthanized animals already slated for death by the shelters ..( they thought they would kill them more mercifully ) I do not always agree with All PETA does , but I will support them , I will voice my opinion to them when I think they are wrong , but I know their fight is a Hard one and I am Glad they exist!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vegan Forever|`|AA11534382	I've been a member of PETA since high school, I'm vegan and my boyfriend works for PETA.<br>  <br>  PETA is a companies worst nightmare if they have anything to do with exploiting animals in any way. A lot of people think that PETA people are psycho. That's not the case. Facts have shown that telling someone about something just isn't enough. People, American's in particular, need shock value these days in order to get the message. That's what PETA does. They tell it like it is and put it out there the way it is. Sometimes people don't want to hear that. Why? Because it might ruin their dinner. Guilt. The problem is that we are all so sheltered and we choose to be ignorant and not take responsibility for the fact that we contribute to the horrible things PETA puts out there for everyone to see. <br>  <br>  PETA employee's are the most dedicated, passionate people I have ever met. They care about not only the animals but the environment and people as well. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you have to break the rules, go to extremes and be non-conforming to get an important message across. PETA does that. <br>  <br>  As the saying goes "Those who obey the rules, rarely make history".|`|acVPPTD2aa	I wouldn't join since their ideas aren't reasonable.<br>  Focus on humans is my thought.<br>  Check out the video it will inform you a bit more about PETA.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	peta is not the only animal welfare organization. do you mean join peta instead of farm sanctuary or compassion over killing?<br>  <br>  i assume that if someone wanted to join peta specifically it could be because they have alot of power, resources.|`|UM8EFzIMaa	"PETA has literally saved thousands and thousands of Animals in Their 28 years "---and they've literally killed thousands and thousands of animals too.<br>  <br>  A gun pointed at my head would probably get me to join PETA. There are much better organizations that don't embarrass their membership, don't fund organizations on the U.S. list of terrorist groups (ALF) and don't lie to the public about their own hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  "I know about the PETA trial and the two employees who Euthanized animals already slated for death by the shelters ..( they thought they would kill them more mercifully )"--what about the 1000's of animals killed in their Virginia "shelter". I've only seen the gov't report from one year but they killed all of the unclaimed animals and made up a **** and bull story after they were outed, as damage control.
4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Corned beef brisket is good and very simple.  Buy a corned beef brisket and put it in the crockpot with the seasoning packet.  Add a quartered red onion, a couple potatoes in wedges, a few bay leaves, and a small handful of peppercorns.  Add 4-6 cups of water and a light beer.  Cover and cook on high all day.  It comes out so tender and yummy.  And the leftovers are good the next day in either sandwiches or hash.
