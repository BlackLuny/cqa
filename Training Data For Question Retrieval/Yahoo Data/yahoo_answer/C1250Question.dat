20090222144319AAjtsZT	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Kilowatt/Hour question?	I am trying to figure this out can u help?         i need help. i got this step:      Number of solar panels: 2   Equipment Cost: $3,800.00   NC Tax Credit: $1,330.00   US Tax Credit: $1,140.00   Total Credits: 65%   Equipment Cost after Credits: $1,330.00   Generated Watts: 380   Generated Kilowatt/Hour: 1.256            it all went fine, but to the next step i do not get the logic behind it:      ? The savings is the number of kilowatt-hours generated per year times the billable kilowatt-hour, which is $0.1048. The billable kilowatt-hour is what you pay if you use power from the grid as opposed to generating it yourself.            so i take the last computed value (that is kilowats per day, multiply with 365 days in an year and then multiply with the price per kilowatt, right)?

20090222145901AADho5o	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does the outer part of a fan go faster than the center during rotation?	This is obviously a physics question.....When a ceiling fan is in rotation, does the outer tip of the fan spin faster than the center?  This doesn't make any sense because the outer part is traveling a greater distance than the center, meaning it would have to travel faster to keep up with the center, but both are fixed together leading me to believe that they travel at the same speed.  Does anyone know how this works or can provide me with a link that will help me understand centripetal force or physics altogether.     This same concept applies to any circular object, like a gear, tire on a car, ball on a string, etc.

HOBr (aq)   H+ (aq) + OBr (aq)        Ka = 2.3 x 10-9         Hypobromous acid, HOBr, is a weak acid that dissociates in water, as represented by the equation above.      (a) Calculate the value of [H+] in an HOBr solution that has a pH of 4.95.      (b) Write the equilibrium constant expression for the ionization of HOBr in water, then calculate      the concentration of HOBr (aq) in an HOBr solution that has [H+] equal to 1.8 x 10-5 M.      (c) A solution of Ba(OH)2 is titrated into a solution of HOBr.          (i) Calculate the volume of 0.115 M Ba(OH)2 (aq) needed to reach the equivalence point                when titrated into a 65.0 mL sample of 0.146 M HOBr (aq).             (ii) Indicate whether the pH at the equivalence point is less than 7, equal to 7, or greater than         7. Explain.      (d) Calculate the number of moles of NaOBr (s) that would have to be added to 125 mL of             0.160 M HOBr to produce a buffer solution with [H+] = 5.00 x 10-9 M. Assume that volume      change is negligible.           I already know the answer to part (ii). It's 7, since the acid and base reach and equivalence once titrated. But I'm confused about the calculations.

20090222160705AApQwsI	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Why is it cold in winter and hot in summer?	So the Earth orbits around the sun. I get that.      Now, since there are seasons, I'm assuming that the orbit is not a perfect circle with the sun in the exact centre of the orbit. So then that leaves me to think that the Earth's orbit around the sun is oval-shaped. And that makes sense. If the sun is slightly off-centre in this oval, then the seasons make sense to me in my head - the sun is closest to the Earth's orbit in the summer, furthest away in the winter and sort of close-ish during spring and autumn.      But then I think that it doesn't make sense because it's cold in Australia while it's hot in America and vice versa. And that totally throws me.      HUH?

20090222160930AAQbDE7	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How do you solve this Conditional Probability problem, please?	You are going to pick a random sample of three parts from a large box of parts, 5% of which are defective. After each draw you note whether or not the selected part is defective and then replace it. Hence, there is a 5% chance of getting a defective part on each of the three draws and the results are independent of each other. What is the probability that you get two defective parts on the first and second draws, followed by a non-defective part on the third draw? Give your answer rounded to 4 decimal places.

On Monday at 10:43 p.m. EST, it will be 38 million miles from Earth, the closest it will ever get. It came from the outskirts of the solar system, 18 trillion miles away. Once it's made the journey around the sun, Lulin will gain enough speed to escape the solar system, so why has NASA not taken any photos for the public to view?

What do you guys really think is going to happen when Earth passes through this magnetice field and has this happened before recently? BTW, alot of people would like to think our planet is immuned to this sort of stuff, but actually in the universe stuff like this happens very regular. We our never really secure and if you thought otherwise I would say that is a false sense of arrogance and security. Really , I am concerned a lil about this since NASA has said something about the Pole Shift that will happen as a result of passing through this galactic field.

It will consist of two oil-filled cylindrical pipes of different diameters. A worker pushes down on a piston at one end, raising the car on a platform at the other end. To handle a full range of jobs, you must be able to lift cars up to 3000kg , plus the 600kg  platform on which they are parked. To avoid injury to your workers, the maximum amount of force a worker should need to exert is 100N.      1. What should be the diameter of the pipe under the platform?   2. If the worker pushes down with a stroke 45.0cm  long, by how much will he raise the car at the other end?

20090222121333AAG2PvZ	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	Can whales and dolphins be harnessed for transportation?	Before the industrial revolution, humans depended on a few species of domesticated terrestrial mammals to generate power and for transportation.  I wonder: could humans have done the same with dolphins and whales, learned to yoke them to outrigger canoes, to steer them, so that they could have a reasonable alternative to trade winds during a calm?  Would bottlenose dolphins have been able to play the role of dogs as hunting partner for the aquatic hunter-gatherer, chasing large fish and diving for shellfish, but not eat them?   And would any species of dolphins and whales have been amenable to domestication?  If not, what about them doesn't work?  And if so, why have humans never done so?

All species depend on sunlight for life processes and therefore would be affected by a period of darkness.   C. Species that populated the location of the impact would die off, while species located far away would survive.   D. Species that are less dependent on sunlight might survive, while others that rely on sunlight would go extinct.      I already have an answer on my mind. But due to educational purposes i would like to hear your answers and your opinions.

20090222133053AAbkVK6	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	How Do You Know When To Turn Somebody Off Support And How Does An Anaesthesiologist Know How Much To Give?	See, today I was finishing my weekend as part of the trauma team. I was working with my consultant and the scrub nurses. It was on Friday night and Mr Biggs (that's not his actual name) presented to the A&E with serious head wounds and flail chest after his car swerved out of the way of a drunk driver and hit a tree at 60mph.      At the time, my consultant Mr Lawson was busy in surgery after a routine spleen rupture. I (along with the A&E doctors) admitted Mr Biggs and I prepped him for surgery. I am still in my first year of trauma surgery training, but was told over the intercom by Mr Lawson that seeing as he was the only consultant on, I would have to begin unsupervised.      I'm nowhere near skilled enough to fix a flail chest, which was the pressing concern, however, I know how to fix a ruptured spleen, and how to treat internal hemorrhaging. So I began there. The spleen was too badly damaged to fix, so I just removed it, and I found the internal bleeding and I stopped it.      This is where the anaesthesiologist question comes in. It took me and the A&E crew 4 minutes to admit Mr Biggs and decide surgery was the desirable option. It then took the nurses and me 7 minutes to prep him for surgery and he was on the operating table in less than 15 minutes. How did the anaesthesiologist know how much to give? He hadn't met Mr Biggs previous to that, he swanned in and simply waved his magic wand. So, do anaesthesiologists have some kind of magic power?      But anyway, the surgery was a success. Mr Lawson came in just before I'd finished stopping the bleeding, and he scrubbed up and fixed the flail chest. Now, most people would think that was it, but Mr Biggs didn't ever fully regain consciousness in the morning or afternoon of Saturday, and by Saturday night he was officially braindead.      I woke on Sunday because my horrible little pager was going off in my ear. It was the post-op ward. Mr Lawson had consulted the chief neurologist Dr Rogan and came to the conclusion that the head injuries that were sustained were too severe. They had explained all this to his family, and they agreed that they would rather have their husband/father/brother being whole than a braindamaged shell that didn't recognize them. I, being the whipping boy, was told to turn his life support off.      I know the basis that you're supposed to turn the life-support off when the patient becomes braindead, basically to free up beds because the managers are the ones that really run hospitals.      But, if your relative was braindead, would you let them turn off the life support?      I'm sorry that this is more of a rant, but it's been a rough weekend and I kinda needed to unload. But, they are genuine questions.

20090222132258AAplQP0	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	What is the best steel for pocket knife blades?	I know that this is a huge argument between knife enthusiasts everywhere, but what is the best steel for a pocket knife blade? I realize that which steel depends on what you are looking for, and what I'm looking for is simply edge retention and blade strength (I've broken way too many 440 stainless blades and tools doing menial tasks).       I could honestly care less about corrosion resistance, because I had an old Case, and no matter how rusty the blade was, it was razor sharp. Plus, if the blade isn't stainless, I can blue the metal and make it look cool.       I did a lot of research about damascus steel blades a few years ago, and in my search stumbled across the knife maker Chris Reeve. I like his work, and I like the fact that his survival knives are made from a single bar of steel, but I'm not sure if A2 tool grade steel is what I'm looking for.      What I really want is a blade that will hold its edge and not fail on me under heavy use. I would like to know what my top choices should be before I go and spend a couple of hundred bucks on a knife.

20090222150805AAzSbIn	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Can someone do this question for Math differential calculus question?	1.By studying the learning behaviour of a group of students a psychologist determines that “receptivity”, the ability of the students to grasp a difficult concept, is dependent on the number of minutes of the lecture that have elapsed before the concept is introduced. At the beginning of a lecture a student’s interest is stimulated but, as time passes, attention has become diffused.      Analysis indicates that receptivity t minutes after the lecture begins is given by the function      R(t) = –0.l t^2 + 2.6t + 43      (i)By using differential calculus, determine the values of t for which R is increasing and for which R is decreasing.
