20090222144223AAes7zC	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	When we moved into our apartment I informed my landlord that the granite counter is broken.how can it be fixed?	Can I use clear caulk to fill in that gap?  I want to offer to fix it because i am tired of tearing sponges, snagging kitchen rags, and shredding paper towels on that darn crack.  The crack goes from one end of the counter to another.  I just want to fill it in and smooth it out with clear caulk... would this work?  do you have any other suggestions as to how I can rig it up?  he obviously does not want to replace the counter...  so I would just like to do some sort of temp. patch up job so that it is easier to live with.      And just to clear it up, no we are not the ones who broke it, and no we are not  responsible for repairing it, i just want to so that i have one less thing to worry about.

20090222145606AAQmn8s	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Any good decorators who can help me pick a paint color for my living room?	I am inheriting a sofa and recliner, and misc. items.  The sofa is beige, the recliner is a burgundy color. I have one wall to put the sofa on and I am wondering what effect painting that one wall a darker color than the rest of the room would be. I am planning on going with some neutral colors.  I have hard wood floors, and a a large entertainment center of natural wood.  It's a medium wood, not light, not dark.  I have a fireplace that is currently painted white.  It is brick though, with a painted wood mantle.  The opening to the fireplace has a black and glass front.  The hearth is black slate.  I love black and want to get some tables with wood and black.  But the color selection for  the walls are driving me crazy.  I thought of a mauve, but everything looks so pink.  So I am looking at beige's and browns, but think a darker color behind the couch would help the couch not to get lost in the wall.  I hope someone has some advice,  as I am one of those that is afraid to use color for fear of using it wrong

Around the last few minutes, I went to the refrigerator to get some ketchup out. I checked on the microwave and noticed that the power had gone out, even though it was plugged in and the house lights still worked. I unplugged it and tested the socket with my alarm clock, and the power worked. I'm afraid to plug the microwave back in. What caused this and is it safe to plug it back in? Was it the refrigerator that made the power out? I noticed that the refrigerator started humming and powering on after I used it. Would it be safe to plug it back in? I'm afraid that the microwave may be damaged even more if I do.      -Thanks

We already have Asparagus, Raspberries, Black Raspberries, Green Beans, a Few Types of Peppers, Rhubard. They had Corn and  apricot tree i think. Also a Kiwi Tree which was quite impressive.   Basically what were working with is 10-15 acres, we are in Zone 4, we have pretty good soil. I cant speak much for it i have heard some words such as "Rapid recharge" and also i had to dig a hole once to get some soil for a garden and after about 4 feet there was some clay type material. Oh and we live in Minnesota. If you could let me know any type of plants that could grow and be picked in one year. I really hope to get my Godmother out, i know if she will do better if she is busy and spending time with others.   Thank you for any help!

I do not want to restrict him to a little area to run, so I thought about lining the road w/ an underground fence. However, I am also contemplating a shock collar simply for when he goes near the road.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be great.  Thanks in advance.

I have houseplants on top of my kitchen cabinets as well as throughout my house (on my bookcase and end tables and nightstand), some of these plants have white fuzzy spots on them (on the leaves) and some other houseplants have little tiny black bugs crawlling around inside which I notice them when I water my plants as I can see them moving.  Where did this come from and how do I safely remove this?  I feel like my house is dirty with my plants having these tiny bugs in them.  I have pets so it needs to be something that is safe.

We live in Big Lake Alaska about 50 miles north of Anchorage and we have a small farm but in previous years the only things that grow very good is peas and cabbage and strawberries we dont know if we are doing something wrong,we put animal puckey and ash on it but they still areent doing good.

We have a green house that we put the tomato's in and they rot befor they get ripe. an help would be great. we have tried for 5 years but i guess alaska isnt very good for gardening if you dont have any money to spend on it. thanks in advance

20090222133624AAbpVCt	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Which colors go best together for a bathroom. Photos inside?	Ok I am having a bunch of problems choosing colors for my TINY Bathroom.  Right now I don't have $$ to remodel so I'm "re-surfacing" the brown tiles (Basically changing the color the easy way,) and also painting the walls.        I have included pictures of my bathroom.  Some of them are poor quality.  I had a horrible time uploading, so I apologize.  I recommend you pause the slideshow then click on the pics individually.      I'm trying to choose between either of the yellows for the walls.   Let me remind you my bathroom is TINY so I'm using this color to brighten up the room.  The whole bottom half of the room is white and you should be able to see this in some of the pics.      As for the color of the tiles, that's where that color chart comes in.  I know it sounds crazy but I like the 3 on the bottom right.  The browns! haha.  But these have a granite look to them so they should go real well with the yellow.   Question is which yellow..  darker or lighter  and then which one from the color chart for the tiles.      lets use yellow 1 as the light   yellow 2 as the darker.      and then brown 1 2 or 3...  going in the order you see them.         Sorry for such a LONG post.  but I really would appreciate help!   Here are the colors.       http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff138...       Any other ideas would be appreciated.  THANKS!!

20090222131539AApakCb	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Need advice about shelf/frames/furniture colors!?	We have chocolate brown couches and brown living room furniture. We just got our living room painted a light oatmeal color and one wall is a dark red (I call it "barn red"). I'm about to hang family pictures on the red wall and think they look best in black frames. On the larger oatmeal wall next to it, we bought black shelves and will sit more black framed pictures on it. My husband was about to hang them and now I'm not sure of the shelf color choice. I didn't think the black frames would look nice on brown shelves and do not want to go to the expense of having to buy all new brown frames. Any advice?       Hope that all makes sense!

20090222130016AAtsYZx	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Am I within my rights to refuse to pay the rent until this is fixed?	I was offered and accepted a 2 bedroom flat (council/housing association) and I signed the tenancy agreement and collected the keys on Friday.  My tenancy isn't due to start until tomorrow, Monday 23rd and I won't be officially moving in for atleast a week, possibly two.  However over the weekend I started moving things in there.       The situation is that the lights in the property do not come on, there is plenty of credit in the electricity meter and I tested out the plug sockets with my stereo which came on ok, so I do have a supply in the property.  Also I have checked the trip switches and they are all on so I can't understand why the lights aren't working (and yes there are bulbs in them - god bless my stepdad for asking me that!!) I have checked 6 lights and none of them come on.  I did speak to the council to report it as a repair but they said because I'm not living in the property it can't be seen as an emergency repair so I need to call back during their normal office hours.  My question is that can I ring them tomorrow, when they expect me to start paying rent, and refuse to pay this until it's fixed as it's not really possible to live there anyway without any lights - and they should have checked that things were working ok before actually allowing me to have the keys to the flat.      Thanks, and apologies if I've lost you a little with this question, I seem to have lost myself!
