RoMnjrataa	Not bad, just stick to online. Only time there's blood is either when you knife someone, or shoot them in the head. No gore to worry about.|`|l3xuQrSQaa	Yeah, this game is fine. It has blood but it is not too gory.|`|vECL7f9uaa	Kinda, it has realistic blood but not over the top and there are no close-ups. and it is not like thats the point of the game, ur not supposed to b spending ur time looking at the dead ppl u r supposed to b moving on.|`|9vP8dB11aa	Very little gore compared to stuff like Gears of War.

012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	Gamestop doesn't care what condition they are in, they still rip you off.    They'll probably give you $20-30 at most for each game, and I that still might be too much.|`|7L7zpAT6aa	30-40 buck all together and if they give you more then you basically just won the lottery.|`|cAOS9Vlfaa	Since they are all PS3 games you will probably get about $100 maybe more. And i think that if you trade in more than 6 next gen games then you get a lot of money off of a new purchase.    I am not sure about that!!! so just ot let you know.    BTW that is store credit. If you want cash then they take 10% or 20% off of your total trade in value. I would go with the store credit and get as much as you can.    Good PS3 games to get:  Resistance 2  Metal Gears Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots  LittleBigPlanet  Grand Theft Auto IV    I would get a PS3 eye with your money too, they are awsome!!! and only $40!! worth it!!    You also might want to get a PSN points card so you can get some games on PSN.    GOOD LUCK!!!    say how much you got when you pick best answer!|`|9vzfI4kDaa	i don't know how they do that, but if you trade in atleast 5 or more then they give you more for the trade    also you get more for trade in value then you get if you want cash|`|tk3QhCpnaa	The games there seem to be in the range of $15-$22 each. Thats for store credit only. If you really want to know call up your local Gamestop and ask them. They will not want to tell you but they can. I have done it several times for the prices of games|`|9vP8dB11aa	Gamestop/EB games is a rip off, personally I wound't get any of those games and I would never sell my games their Ebay or my local game shop (like used games) if I was going to sell, but I rarely sell my games.|`|PJ2198Slaa	they wont give you what you want for those games.... if i were you i would sell them on Ebay.

LdnTXFMiaa	I think you should change your Skarmory to a Staraptor, Staraptor is very good, It has the highest SP attack and speedy too.  This is my team:   Staraptor:  -Bave Bird  -Fly  -Defog  -Close Combat  Roserade:  -Mega Drain  -Grass Knot  -Solarbeam  -Cut  Cresselia  -Ice Beam  -Psychic  -Shadow Ball  -Captivate  I always use Staraptor because it is speedy and the Attack or SP.  Attack base is very high.. Roserade is fast and defense is high, Cresselia is speedy  and attack is high..  Roserade is good with  Rhyperior(Palmer's Pokemon)  Starptor and Roserade good with Milotic(Brave Bird)  Cresselia is good with Dragonite(Ice Beam)    That's my request.. Hope it helps|`|MFAVIW1waa	Well i assume your toxicroak is a sweeper so there's no point for toxic because you want to get rid of them fast. Gyarados needs a STAB move so switch thunderbolt with waterfall because thunderbolt is a sp.atk. Your Skarmory is great, i suggest sending it out first so you can use spikes to your advantage. Overall a great party you don't need to worry, the first 20 trainers are heaps easy. When i versed Palmer (and won) he had a Rhyperior, Milotic and something else... sorry i forgot. So for that round don't send your skarmory out first. The party i had when i versed him was Empoleon, Gardevoir, and Blaziken so you'll beat him easy.|`|BJJSNFcJaa	how does your gyarados have 4 hp?? and toxicroak has 6 defence it isnt possible to have 4 hp !!! nor 6 defence!!

r0bZQGPQaa	The order is 3, then 1, then 4, then 2. All are great to play for story and action. Just play 1 before anything else and you'll be alright, this is because 1 introduces everyone. 2 was weird but its okay. In 4 you play as Nero, who doesn't like Dante, but is not related to Dante or Vergil. You do get to play as Dante once you reach a certain point, but unless you played the other 3, you won't think much of him. Vergil makes no appearance in 4 or 2. Devil May Cry 4 is a great game which you should enjoy.|`|AA12149874	DMC 4 is awesome game,i played DMC 3 only before this and it is much better,and relatively more harder than DMC 3.    you will play as Nero for almost half of the game and Dante for some missions. no Vergil in this game (only Nero and Dantie)    i would not like to tell you about the game so you have the impact of the surprise during the game play but i can assure you that this game is really very good and i refere to the story,game  play,the very pretty graphic levels so it deserve your play.    hope i helped you enough.

63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	yes it say on a scratch off ticket it wil say chances are 1 in 3.86 or what ever off wining a prize   as where a power ball or mega million the odds are roughly 1 in 8 will win i am sure it will say on the back of the ticket you fill out to play your own numbers|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Sort of.    The scratch tickets are all pretty much the same odds,  because there is only a certain number printed and the prize pool is decided ahead of time.    Powerball (or any other online lottery) has no set odds.   A persons odds are determined by how many tickets they have and how many total tickets were sold.   The prize pool (other than top prize,  and its not even guaranteed since there may be more than one winner),  changes from draw to draw depending how many winners were in the previous one.    Your odds can change dramatically from one week to the next.    Hope it helps|`|AA12180741	http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BK... here is a site that explains odds, well basically the more tickets you buy the more chances you have.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	Yes.    The odds on winning the lottery are based on the mathematical probability of, for example, all six numbers being drawn and matching up with at least one person who bought a ticket.   It has nothing to do with the number of people who purchased those tickets.   Your odds of winning are the same whether you're the only person playing, or there are 20 million other ticket holders.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	you have a better chance or odds of a bird dropping poo in your mouth while yawning during walk outside or a dying person you met once 10 years ago leaving you in their will. if you put every dollar you would have used to buy a lottery ticket in a savings account you will have a million saved before you ever hit the lottery. don't believe me then start an trial experiment open a savings account and from now on every dollar you spend on lottery tickets put a matching dollar amount in that savings account and never look at the balance until you win the lottery. you can leave the savings account to me in your will if you should die before you win the lottery. i do want you to win though so you can see how much you spent winning it.
uX50g9Plaa	OOH.. you mean stairs for a  foundation?    yeh took me ages to find the stairs then i realised they were right in front of my face the whole time.    okay so go into build mode when your buiilding your house, then click the little icon of a staircase.after that, there will be three icons, on the top, there is an icon of a full staircase on the bottom there are two icons, these are the ones you need to build with the foundation. Click on the one with the half stairs with the dots leading downward.       chose the style you like, then just move your mouse over to the edge of the foundation then click. The icon next to it is for hand railing. just click on that and move your mouse over to the stairs and click.    TAHDAH..!  by the way, you need a bit of room before you can have stairs, so in other words, a balcony before the front door.|`|9OzsEkZYaa	Yeah I know what you mean  It took me ages to figure that out too :D  Go into build mode  Then try stairs  Use the little stairs icon and click where you want them to lead  This is obviously after you have built the foundation for your house  If it's not in stairs, it might be in miscellanious  I don't really know but I tried :P  Good luck :)|`|YevgVOdXaa	Try gamefaq.com, it's cool

mmavy34kaa	Rune armor (runite is the ore and bar) can be purchased from other players, The Grand Exchange, or, if you're really desperate, there's like a Champion's Guild which sells some rune stuff, or some guy after you beat Dragon Slayer sells the platebody. Smithing your own armor is very, very rarely useful in Runescape. The only place where this would be useful is if you died and lost your armor, and even then, the requirement to smith it is still way above the requirement to wear it.

ajomjCepaa	Hi Nick,    Price lists for beanies are so out of date, and so overinflated that they are worthless.    Go on ebay and search for any particular beanie you have. Then click the 'Completed Listings' box on the left. This will show you what people actually paid. If the price is in green, then it did sell. If the price is in red or black, than it did not sell.    Beware of companies offering you cash for your beanies. These are scams, whose sole purpose is to get money FROM you, not give money TO you. They state a large price, IF the beanies meet their quality standards when you ship to them. Guess what. They never do. And these companies will be more than glad to return your beanies to you, if you pay shipping AND a processing fee. Scam. Get money from you, not give money to you.    Good luck!

9jwNS1YUaa	it's all about ball movement. learn to call plays on offense, because otherwise your players will just stand around.     practice a lot with the post-up moves and the shot stick. and smack the dribble moves, and pro hop. you have to put everything together.    you really have to play the game from the inside out. get inside get baskets, and make sure you are open if you're gonna take a jumper. i mean really open.     strong defense also leads to good offense. if you stop them and get the rebound you can push the ball and get fast break jumpers.     it's a basketball sim. you have to play good all around ball. and be patient when you bump the difficulty, because after you master rookie, you will lose on pro, and so on.

ZFLgmNgYaa	There are two ways    One you could get an auto type of some type and normally it will record you typing and then play it over and over.    Others will have you enter in text and it will type it over and over.    I don't remember where to find these autoers but simply googling Auto Type would find you one. Jagex can not tell if you are autoing and I've used it million of times when I use to play. I even used a program called GhostMouse and they can't detect you. I how ever had to auto chat and ghost mouse run at the same time and made random chats of me talking to myself like     :oh I hate cutting down trees"  :This is taking forever"  "Why the hell does everyone want some many logs!"    You could also use notepad and copy and paste. This is a safe and classic version but you will spend alot of time pressing Ctrl + V|`|yVAzOBARaa	Some phrases can ber said and repeated autmatically if they are a quick chat phrease, however to do anything custom requires an "auto talker" macro.

vCAeQMlUaa	free: i would say mine gold its about 400 gp per ore. you could try coal, or getting coal and iron and making bars but theres a 50% chance youll get iron.... you could make runes but thats not really good money. try woodcutting yews those can usually sell really well. also you could kill hill giants that are by barbarian village and get big bones and sell those. (you need a brass key) lastly you could catch lobsters and cook them for xp (but lose about 50-100 gp per lobster) or you could sell them.      members: this is easy.... pick flax in camelot. you could either sell that or spin it in lumby castle(easiest place to do it cause bank is up 1 floor). you could buy flax on the g.e. (but not make as much) and spin that you'll most likely be able to get back what u paid and get what you paid again (ex if u spend 500k on flax youll get 500k back and about 500k again. which is making 1m but you only get 500k as a profit. you could lend stuff like full sara. you could steal as the skill. woodcutting again. or flech arrows or make yew shorts/longbows. also pure essence|`|N2O9rJvUaa	u can sell some stuff...  many players buy feathers n so many people use to buy runes  so u could sell some of tht stuff... it worked for me:)|`|d7JQS6qzaa	hill giants, moss giants..get bones and sell...good profit. Hill G=28cb  Moss G=42cb  Also if ur mem law run..|`|N4tBqRqMaa	For free players: I have no idea.  What I do is buy flax on the Grand Exchange and spin it in Lumbridge Castle then sell it back and repeat. Bowstring is worth about twice as much as flax, so if you spin all the flax you buy, you just doubled the money you spent. 5000 bowstrings are worth about 1 million coins.    What I used to do is kill Chaos Druids in the Chaos Druid Tower near Ardougne (need 58 thieving to get in though) and sell the herbs.

e8dc63c6a93e534d95e66cc04a7c3dc6aa	there isn't one specific drift car that is the best. they are all equally good; you just need to figure out the best way to do it.  the porsche is a real wheel drive car and has some good speed to it. i suggest redoing your tires so they are set for drift, and set your brakes to somewhere between the middle and under steer.  this will prevent you from stopping early in your drift and spinning out.<br>  <br>  now for the actual drifting technique.  with fast rear wheel drive cars you have to take into consideration that the back wheels are the ones getting all the power.  so what you need to do is enter the corner and make sure you dont turn too early or too late ( the best time is right before your front tires hit the bonus zones along the edge of the tracks.  your back wheels will end up sliding through the bonus zone and boost your score as well as get a good drift if you use proper technique.<br>  <br>  make sure you dont accelerate through the drift until your back tires have slid all the way so the car is almost straightened out.  when this happens hit the gas and use a little bit of nitro to even the car out.  if there is another corner right after that one it puts your car in the perfect position to enter that corner the same way you entered the first corner.<br>  <br>  good luck and just practice with those tips and remember:<br>  1) dont accelerate through the drift<br>  2) when the car is straight accelerate and use nitro to straighten out<br>  3) prepare to do it again if there is another corner when you exit|`|06fb9e29f5615dd654bf2c8093e8f708aa	there isnt a best car but ther is a ar called a Nissan Skyline GTR34 it is very good at drift bc of its max handling with good speed and my favorite car for the drifting is a Ford GT it is good at speed and that bounuses up the pointinge so either pick on of those 2|`|05b0bf32304de53987e6027fe0ff089daa	okay|`|df07443e83c335b14b07f463b2f61f06aa	idk i need help with that to

Multithreading splits tasks into 'threads' where possible, and runs them in parallel across both cores of Dual Core or HyperThreading (virtual dual core) CPUs to improve performance. Note that raising the values of the iThreads, iNumHavokThreads and iOpenMPLevel settings very high doesn't automatically mean it uses that many threads - it all depends on how many threads are actually possible based on the information being processed.

You didn't mention your video card whether it's ATI or NVIDIA?  Find the brand of your video card and then you can find the drivers for that.  That could be the reason unless you have the drivers installed?  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ati.amd.com/products/gamersolutions.html" rel="nofollow">http://ati.amd.com/products/gamersolutio...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/dr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Try that first to see how the game will work.  It should work unless it's an issue with your current video card or maybe it didn't install properly?  If you have other things running in the background while you have installed the game maybe that could interfere with the installation?  You may also have to install direct X as well unless you have the latest?<br>  <br>  If you tried all those things try to reinstall the game but disable your anti-virus and your fire wall until you install the game and then restart your computer and try to see if it will work after that? <br>  <br>  If you have an onboard video card then you may need a better video card to play the game.  A onboard video card is built right in the motherboard verses a mother board that requires a separate video card.<br>  <br>  If after the second attempt then maybe the game may not be compatible with your video card and you may have to upgrade your video card if the card is not compatible with the game or if it's an onboard video card?<br>  <br>  Another thing is having enough memory on your system so that you have enough memory for you game.  You didn't mention what your computer specs are so I am going on a hunch about what could be some of the possible problems.<br>  <br>  There could also be conflicts with software depending on what you have on your computer?<br>  <br>  The way to find what you have on your computer system is to go to the start menu and click on run and a box will pop up.  Type in dxdiag.  That will give you your system information and if you go to display it should list your video card information.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|6940636c14f0c7788b4864b40489789baa	did you shut down and reboot?|`|5b54831a754803f9094d2de6fe37beafaa	Ur system requirements dont meet.

Designed as an improvement on Umbrella's previous Tyrant design, Nemesis can use weapons and think independently enough to overcome obstacles to complete its missions. Unleashed in Raccoon City, its orders are to kill all members of STARS task force on sight, with Jill Valentine as its primary target.He is NOT Wesker.He has no name.    Wesker's Death:No.He didn't die.He was alive at the end of the game.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Albert Wesker is the villain of the first game. He "dies" in it at the hands of the final boss, but it is later revealed had taken a big gamble on a substance (which doesn't have a real name yet, so fans have dubbed "the Wesker Virus") which sometimes revives a person upon death, sometimes with superhuman abilities. He first resurfaces in RE: Code Veronica, basically just long enough to grab a corpse and run away.    He doesn't appear at all in RE4 proper, only being referenced as a mutual acquaintance and likely boss of both Ada and Krauser (though Krauser was betraying him for Saddler [RE4's main villain], and there's reason to believe Ada was betraying him for some other company). He makes a brief appearance in the non-canon Assignment Ada minigame and as a playable character in the Mercenaries Minigame in RE4, as well.    In RE: Umbrella Chronicles, we see the full story of his betrayal of Umbrella, how he survived RE1, and a new section where he steals the research Umbrella had at the RE1 mansion while infiltrating an Umbrella base in Siberia.    Most likely, Wesker is in some way behind the events of RE5, but he may well continue his more shadowy guiding hand position, having some underling being the visible villain.      As for Nemesis, all Tyrants (and Nemesis is just an exceptionally distant variation of a yrant) are experimented-on clones of an Umbrella employee named Sergei, who is running the Umbrella base in RE:UC.
l3ZUVqB7aa	I just got the game and out of a ten I would give it a 6 or 7. I like it so far, I would get the game if you dont care that much about actually getting to play every play during games. You do get to experience what its like to be a GM which I can honestly say is not an easy job. I havnt finished my first season yet so I dont really know what its like after season one.    The game costs 40 dollars and if your a diehard baseball fan and are interested in just signing free-agents, making trades, managing players contracts its a good game to play. If I were you I would go rent the game first, because you then will be sure if you should buy the game or not.

I mean, when your computer is first turned on and you want to play your sims, do you have to click on your name because there are other people who use your computer too?    If you do, maybe try restarting your computer, then clicking to get into your section and checking it again.  I have read where people thought they lost everything only to discover that they were looking under the wrong user name.    Hopefully that's what's wrong in your case.

They never were made in all thast big of supply, since I think only Phantasy Star Online actually went online, and only about a half-dozen other games supported LAN play.    You could try Gamestop. They might have the used still. But more likely, you'll have to go eBay, and last I checked, they run about $30 there.|`|H2w0bJmPaa	eh  gamecube doesnt go online  so they just made it able to go live?    i have a gamecube      sorry for my ignorance

But half of them are for finding treasure items (use a walkthrough) and another third is for using weapons for a certain amount of kills. 4 Trophies are for each of the difficulties (Which is surprisingly easy) and the game is nice and quick, you'll have a platinum in one week.     A few trophies, which actually require some skill, like stealth kills, are easily obtained by killing one unsuspecting guard, then restarting the check point and repeating 20 times until even the hardest trophy is achieved.

jbuIA3T0aa	if you don't won't the parents to age have them drink the elixer of life to extend their young age.That way the baby continues to grow.I don't use aging off when my sims have babies. Before you use the elixer of life have the aspiration level 5 on each sim that way they can drink it several times without it backfiring. If there aspiration level is too low it will backfire and age them.  im not too sure about the toddler though. Sorry:(  hope this helps|`|Dso7k3sjaa	To be able to use any of the features of the tombstone of life & death on the baby, the first thing you have to do is to make the baby selectable.  Which, ironically, actually takes it's picture out of the family.  So, you have to do it again.  Now it will be selectable.  Then, you must click on spawn/tombstone of life & death.  Once you have the tombstone, and while you are still controlling the baby, click on that and find something about birthdays.  I don't normally use the t of l&d to change the age of a sim so I cannot remember what it says exactly.    Or, an easier way as long as you have Nightlife installed, is to make the baby selectable (I know, that parts the same) then, open the cheat box back up and type in:    agesimscheat on    Now click on the baby and you should see an option to change the baby's age.  Click on toddler and the baby will age up now.  Oh, but you should have one of the parents holding it so they can throw the baby up in the air for the baby to be able to age.    Then, you should turn the testing cheat back off and also turn the agesimscheat back off again as well.  (Type it the same but put off at the end.)    **eta -- if you do anything that will make the social worker come and take the toddler away, she will also take the baby.  When social workers come, they take all sims on the lot that are younger than teens.  They will not take teens away though.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	welcome to mother hood|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	hit ctrl,shift, and c at the same time the type in aging on until Selena grows up to a tod and then type in the same thing only this time put off instead of on.    If you stop taking care of Emmett the social worker will eventually take him away...Idk better way to get rid of him|`|fIK9LBEuaa	Well, if she's a baby, then it will only take a day or two for her to age into a toddler. I'm sure you know this, but when it says, "Selena will grow up in one day", (or something), then buy a birthday cake from buy mode and have her parents age her, which will age her a day sooner.    Even though you don't want them to age, a day or two won't hurt, unless one of them is on the brink of aging already. I would just take the aging cheat off, until she's a toddler, then turn it back on.    If you really can't do that, then pull up the tombstone of L&D again, and just chose the option that says "age Selena". It might be on the tombstone, or it might be by just pulling up the boolprop cheat. (shift+click on the active sim).     Good luck! :)|`|6xyUbXnEaa	Turn aging on until Selena is a toddler. If one of your other sims age, just use boolProp to age them back down again =)

Your cards meant nothing and you split evenly.|`|iTtMQud1aa	in hold em all players at table use the first 3 cards which is flop,then the next card is the turn,then the last card is the river in that case you both had a Straight 3 4 5 6 7 .Neither one of your down cards are played good luck .|`|3Xu9fAESaa	would of been a split pot    Only the best 5 cards on the table count as your hand.    The best 5 cards on the table there are those laid down (because it's a straight) so only they count as both you and your friends hand.|`|C6MbeW70aa	It is a split pot.  In Hold'em you play the best possible 5 card hand using either 2 cards from your hand and 3 from the board, 1 from your hand and 4 from the board, or 0 from your hand and 5 from the board.    In this hand someone with 89 would have the nuts (best possible hand), someone with an 8 and any other card would have the 2nd nuts, and all other hands would play the board.    FYI, the first three cards are called the flop, and all 5 cards together (flop + turn + river) are called the board.    If you were playing Omaha Hi and not Texas Hold'em, then you would each have to use both of your hole cards and 3 cards from the board.  In this case you would win with a QQ765 (pair of queens) to your opponents KT765 (K high).|`|GJtpnnDIaa	i think u know the answer to ur own question, geez. and by wtf you knew there was a straight on the board, and neither of your hole cards amounted to anything. split pot.   u also didnt mention the suits, so for all we know there could have been a flush.  so technically speaking, until we know the suits of the board and your hole cards, the answer is inconclusive

Better Wi-fi    Rebuttal to Micheal R: Better Graphics: Its a portable system. Why are you so picky about graphics? Besides, the ds makes it work with mostly 2d games. More realistic: Why would you play a game to be realistic? Games should be ways to have fun doing things you couldnt do in the real world. Games like pokemon open a new world to gamers. Everything after that: Other things can do all those things, and dont you need to be next to a wi-fi thing for the psp internet to work anyway? So how is that useful?

tgtX4d8Laa	Relax man you are getting help from a pro here. I am a Macro Monarch specialist. Dimensional Fissure is better in my opinion because some spells/traps you just don't want them to be removed. Here's my own personal Macro Monarch list that wins a lot.    5+ Monsters-8  x3 Caius the Shadow Monarch  x2 Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch  x1 Mobius the Frost Monarch  x1 Kuraz the Light Monarch  x1 Raiza the Storm Monarch    4- Monsters-14  x3 Cyber Valley  x3 D.D. Survivor  x3 D.D. Scout Plane  x3 Gravekeeper's Spy  x1 Spirit Reaper  x1 Breaker the Magical Warrior    Spells-11  x3 D.D.R.-Different Dimension Reincarnation  x3 Dimensional Fissure  x2 Soul Exchange  x2 Gravekeeper's Servant  x1 Mystical Space Typhoon    Traps-8  x3 Compulsory Evacuation Device  x2 Macro Cosmos  x2 Solemn Judgment  x1 Mirror Force    Hope it brings you as many victories as it has brought me.    EDIT- The reason D.D. Warrior Lady is limited and D.D. Warrior and D.D. Assailant aren't limited is because they don't give you the option of removing or not. You just HAVE to.|`|An8DPsv5aa	What the other guy said isnt really that great.    Mobius is a terrible monarch and is no good in the meta anymore.

cWhKVKQsaa	360 has a better online play. That's why you pay for it. It comes out to a little over $4 a month. Its really cheap and the servers don't crash. The PS3 servers are always crashing, that's why the online service is free. There are no upsides to the PS3 except for th blu ray player, but xbox will be coming out with one this year for the 360 for about $100. The xbox 360 is cheaper, has better games, has better graphics, and has more people playing online. Go with the 360.

dKz9no3waa	There is absolutely no losing in this situation! I have both games and can say they are both amazing and worth every penny i spent on them. The only questions you should be asking yourself is:  1) How much time do I have to commit to the game?  2) Do I like nonstop action or do I like to take my time and explore?  3) How much do I like dogs?  4) Do I like Achievements?  5) Do I love bloody and messy gore?    Now ill tell you why you should ask yourself these questions.  1) Fallout 3 is VERY massive! You can spend countless hours just exploring and not even bothering with the main story. You will need lots of spare time to enjoy this one. If you have played Oblivion then you'll know what im talking about. Fable 2 is long too and you could do side quests for hours as well, but in all comparison Fallout 3 demands more time.  2) Fable 2 and Fallout 3 both have amazing combat and HOLY S**T moments; but Fable 2 doesn't have as big pauses in between fighting parts. The only parts you aren't fighting in both games is when you are in towns and cities talking to people and trading, which Fallout 3 has you doing this alot.  3) Haha! I had to add this cuz both games give you a canine companion. Fallout 3 does not make the pup mandatory (the dog is introduced later in the game and his companionship is optional) where as Fable 2 will definitely have you caring for the little guy (especially if you are an animal lover like i am).  4) Both games have Achievements but Fable 2 has more miscellaneous ones that are fun to unlock. Fallout 3's are mostly unlocked from completing quests with a few exceptions.  5) Last but certainly not least is the gore. Fable 2 doesnt have much of it but there is blood. On the other hand it comes by truckloads in Fallout 3! The gore is EPIC in Fallout 3 due to the V.A.T.S. combat system which slows things down and bodies and heads explode in slow motion.    Basically you can NOT go wrong with either game and i would give both games a 10 out of 10.|`|jK7pklCKaa	Fallout 3, the reason being is its a far longer and superior game, fable 2 is a decent game but it doesn't compare to fallout 3, it took me about 10 or so hours to finish fable 2 and its taken me almost 50 to finish fallout as there is so much to do. I often find myself completely forgetting about the main quest as im exploring or doing one of the many side quests.|`|SBcxooLsaa	fallout 3 forrr hours of ganeplay|`|wKo5P7ueaa	people sya that fable two is a lot better|`|u52LAW5Laa	fable 2 is a good rpg, and i heard fallout3 is a nice fps/rpg so really its up to u|`|ByFSP9HKaa	Dude get Fallout 3. It owns. Whatever you do causes the world to change around you. Your quests change when you do bad or good things. Also the people who help you in the game change. Fallout has a karma system which is what changes your quests and companions.    Fable 2 is fun but its no where near Fallout 3. The 3rd person view gets annoying and the camera angle is often bad. Your dog in the game is REALLY annoying. But it is fun when you get to marry people and rent out houses. There are also many different weapons.    Fallout 3 also has alot of weapons but not as many as Fable 2. Fable is more laidback and cartoonish but Fallout 3 is dark and has a huge world. Fallout 3 is more for hardcore players considereing the time you have to put in to get good at it.    Fallout 3 gets a 9 out of 10  Fable 2 gets a 7 out of 10

eNHGiEvGaa	The Ace is a key card in most poker games.  However, it is probably most important in Draw Poker with the "bug" (a single joker in the deck that can be played as an ace, or to fill a straight or flush, but is not fully "wild.")  It also takes on exceptional importance in Hi-Lo Stud, because it can be played high or low.  Catching an ace *almost always* improves your hand in some way in hilo stud, and even when it doesn't, it has scare potential against opponents with vulnerable hands.    Now, poker *can* be played by two players, but it's more commonly played by a larger group.    I believe the Ace is highly valuable in Pinochle, and Bezique which was the progenitor of Pinochle, designed for two players.    If I come up with any other suggestions suitable for two players, I'll edit.|`|swJuTXcSaa	Three of a kind with an ace|`|M7G3MZb5aa	The only card games i can think of where the ACE is of incredible importance are....    -Blackjack, when dealt and ace, your instantanious EV for that hand is +53%  -War  -poker, the ace is important, but not solely revolved around
RSi9sLhGaa	you have to go to the spirit tree and go to the casino part and talk to one of the guys at the end of the room. he will give you two options,  exchange money for medals or exchange medals for things. If you have medals already choose exchange medals for items if not choose the other one. once you buy 1000 medals, it will be enough to buy the truth bangle which shows stamina and fatigue. there are also other things to trade for. like the love bangle which I think is the most important one. It shows love and friendship points.  If you haven't unlocked the casino find the five first ones and do it!  I know where some of them are  1.go to Romans mansion and there is a fountain stand in front of it and press "a"  2. go to the inns yard there is a oven thingy stand in front of it and press "a"  3.go to where the blue bar is there is a water thingy stand in front of it and press "a"  4. this is the last one its when you walk on the bridge 10 times , im not sure how many times but you'll figure it out!  5. you unlock him in the first video of the game so you don't need to do anything for this.|`|ZwqQiRZVaa	Well i dont have a DS But star my Answer man here

lQGDV7MEaa	Not a lot, even if they are new. GameStop likes to rip you off by giving you store credit for your games, and more often than not, you'll usually spend more than they give you. This means they make a profit off you for buying their used merchandise, and then the money they make for selling you their games.  You might be lucky to $30 for them, but they'll just sell them for $60, easily.|`|a8a441aa6973c0e73348e618806e0c1faa	try calling or checking a website like gamespot|`|0DxgW7pmaa	I'm Sorry to tell you this but your not going to get much out of games from game stop.I suggest you sell them on ebay.

tYlTcQB9aa	mmm get veracs it hits threw prayer and gives attack bonus torag is deff bonus and dh is str which out of all dh hits harder mostly i never got to wear guthix so idk about that one|`|pp8uEV7haa	I'd definitely not buy separate pieces, because when you have the full set you get special effects. Unless you want to buy Torag just for the defense, because the set effect of Torag's isnt worth the set effect. I'd recommend Verac's if you do a lot of PvP, like Duel Arena and Castle Wars, because the set effect makes it so that you can hit through the Protect from Melee prayer. If you do a lot of Slayer or Defense training, I'd buy Guthan's because its set effect can heal you for what you hit, occasionally.

qbzen2XYaa	Just be careful, if blizzard finds out you are selling or that the account was sold as your name never gets removed from the account after you sell it..   they can ban the account and all your players are now lost.    Also keep in mind, you technically do not own your characters, Blizzard does.... so.. Keeping that in mind, how can you LEGALLY sell something that isnt yours in the first place.  Yes i know people sell accounts all the time, however its very easy as shown above in the top for someone to agree to sell an account, and then have the person who has already taken control of the account claim that they never recieved what the bought.      Keep in mind too, that you can also look suspicious to a buyer of an account too... All you have to do is go to blizzard and claim someone hacked your account, use your secret password, and get it back... Very easy to do as well, and i am sure it has and will be done many times over.|`|07YBD5mJaa	be very careful when doing this, my husband tried to sell his account not too long ago, not sure of the details, all i know is that his character was apparently worth some really good money. any how, he met someone online that offered him $800 for it, so they arrange to sell it through pay pal. well, my husband saw that he put the money into the pay pal account, so he gave the guy all of his information for his character, and assumed everything was well. well, the very next day my husband discovered that this guy took the character, and reported to pay pal that he didn't receive what he paid for, so they took the money out of the account asap. he got away with my husbands character and the money, my husband was so upset.  so, be very careful when you do try to sell it.  best of luck!|`|FNvv74UQaa	E-bay is the best option - look for similar accounts for pricing.|`|E8H4mGokaa	Check ebay for what similar accounts are selling for and base your pricing on theirs.|`|A7EjGpiSaa	well i dont know alot about world of warcraft but i do know you should sell it on scythe.|`|ehea7Tboaa	WWW. megadork.com.org.lame.net

Deep Blue was a computer designed solely for chess and not just an engine. However according to some sources others have stated Deep Junior was clearly better than Deep Blue.

Last of which was Hydra which has not been beaten by a human yet, therefore considered the strongest:  http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?...

x1nKJucSaa	First, you do not need to init-cap every word you use. That's just... bad. Second, if you listen to the story, Ninja Ninja says that they'd capture fireflies and put them in a lantern, and if one of the flies hit the flame, it would go out. Since the Ninja Robots look like bugs... well, you throw the Ninja Robots into the GIANT BUG ZAPPER, in the CENTER, the blue portion, and it goes out.    Bottom Line: Parry an attack from a ninja robot, press A to jump on his shoulders, then throw him at the large blue platform in the center of the "Bug Zapper". It may take a few tries, but once you do it. It goes boom, and the story continues.

If you're certain that you have all of the required maps, try logging out of Xbox Live and signing back in.

hbDkp6uNaa	There is a third Kingdom Hearts game that just came out.....But it's called Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories. It fills the gaps between games one and two.  http://na.square-enix.com/games/kingdomh...|`|vtJDHJDYaa	Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually an unconfirmed title. Its real name is Birth By Sleep.  Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep on PSP  The new installment of the Kingdom Hearts series for the PSP, explaining the deep past of Kingdom Hearts, we are introduced by 3 characters, Ven, Terra and Aqua, Ven has a relation with Sora, Ven means air, as Sora means wind, which are the same; Aqua means water, and Kairi means ocean, which leads the same to water; Terra means earth, as Riku has some relation with earth. The major playable character is Terra, seen in the scans. In the game, the world Hollow Bastion or better known as Radiant Garden will explain himself more. Disney characters will make an appearance here as well. The old man is an older version of Xehanort, the game itself will show the gamers the Real Keyblade Master.|`|of1dkoFtaa	Well sadly the answer is no....  although the birth by sleep is true...  hmm there isnt gonna be a 3 but theres gonna be 3 games released that explains things from different perspectives  theres def gonna be   kh: birth by sleep  kh: coded  kh: 352/ 2 days ..or someting along the lines of those numbers    coded is on the mobile phone ..dammit and is only gonna be released in japan  birth by sleep i think is gonna be released on DS  and the last one ..which i cant remembe the numbers is gonna be released on psp  (funny after all these releases nobody has released it on wii which is a real shame ...that would be soooo cool)    birth by sleep: you use roxas for the the entire game...it shows how and why he became organization member  the numbers of 2 days thing is about the organization and the 14th member of organization 13 ...which sounds kinda stupid but whatever  and the last  one coded is a bunch of mini games i think its kinda like chain of memories  i may have the first 2 mixed up but those are the stories...i hope i helped enuff.    and keyblade war isnt a game its a part of the story, its explains   terra, aqua and the last guy whos name means cloud or something...they look like kairi, sora and riku...    also just because kh 3 hasnt been announced this year idk maybe it could get made in the future...|`|3KexhD6naa	yes and it came out in japan but not in the us yet. its coming pretty soon.
2chHEzY7aa	they're basically the same thing. the DS lite is just smaller|`|iqVDRH1laa	Well if you're going to play in the dark the DS Lite is better. It's way brighter, and easier to grab.

kIqq7yIAaa	you should consider upgrading your computer as that single core CPU isn't going to hold up to the future of gaming    always go with the "recommended" system requirements  not minimum for best gaming results    for now save your money on that new video card and save up for a new system one made for serious gaming  you won't regret the upgrade and you might find a new game to play in the future   be ready for it|`|xqUsjMUiaa	You should first upgrade you processor to a core 2 duo 6600.  The best graphics card on the market right now is the PNY 8800 GTX. It runs to about 300 bucks though. but hey, its worth it. Trust me this card rapes, it smokes crysis like nothing. Watch the video I put in the source. Remember, there are a lot of different 8800 gt cards, you must get the one that says (PNY 8800 GTX)!

84vpPbBoaa	You should get pokemon platnuim. It's main character pokemon is giratina level 47. It has all the same places as diamond and pearl plus many more. There is a place were you catch giratina and by what i have heard it's most popular name is the torn world. In the torn world you can walk upside down and side-ways on some walls. You can't catch any other pokemon besides giratina in the torn world. Yes you can use the action replay on it all you have to do is get the game id and put it in where the action replay says add new game.|`|gENerWjGaa	I think you should get Pearl because pokemon platinum is almost just like Diamond and Pearl but with Giratina as the main objective of the game instead of Dialga or Palkia.You can also use the action replay on pokemon platinum you just have to put in the codes.|`|PzmVpsmYaa	You should get platinum. It comes out on March 22 09. You can use action replay and gameshark on any game. You can catch Palkia, Dialga, and Giratina in Pokemon Platinum.

afJz77pjaa	The Last Revelation was the hardest. Just trying to figure out what I needed to do was so frustrating! Especially the Citadel levels.    Easiest was probably TR:1. It was pretty straight forward, but still fun.    The most enjoyable, imo, is probably a tie between TR:2 and T:TLR. I like the more difficult ones. :)    I didn't care much for Chronicles though.

2BjcTzmAaa	Hi there.    Sorry dude, you got your info all wrong.    In Lost and the Damned. You play a biker dude. His name is Johnny Klebitz.    New weapons include a sawn off shotgun, pipe bombs, a grenade launcher and an automatic 9mm which Rockstar says 'shreds people'.    One of the missions is for Elizabeta where you will replay the mission "Blow Your Cover", alongside Niko, but from Johnny's perspective this time. Niko and Playboy X took off to the roof, but Johnny decides to stay and fight the cops head on.    Remember that mission? When you met elizabeta, you will also meet a biker dude, which has a tattoo on his neck. The biker gang is called 'The Lost'.    I also hope you remembered hearing that when you were playing GTA4.    Besides, this is just an add-on for Xbox360 owners.    For ps3 owners, there are no updates or news for now.    Unlike Niko, who fought mostly alone, Johnny fights with his gang and they help out, especially in battles with the cops.    Hope this are useful. Good luck    Over, Out. -Tami-|`|BqxYa9tEaa	He most likely will be able too.

CKRfaRYvaa	I don't know what operation system you have, but I discovered that with Vista, I can play it without the CD by changing the start menu to the classic look and then opening Fallout 3 through that menu.  Instead of taking me to the screen that has options like Play Game and Data Files, it takes me to the internal menu, the one with Load Game, New Game, etc.  I'm not sure why it does this, but if you have Vista this might help.

7JDkUMVuaa	Unfortunatly xbox's aren't able to take music from ipods :( . The only way you can get it on there is by burning it to a cd and then putting that into the xbox. Also I think you might be able to stream music and videos from your computer, but you need windows media center, and it doesn't work with me.|`|5mT0dqGyaa	Well what i think and i have tried to make a play list for my mp3 but you cant copy the song to iPod or a mp3 but you can make a play list on the xbox and listen to it there|`|DY8YYluqaa	To get music on your xbox you can directly stream music from a pc/laptop with windows media centre.    or the easier and better option is to use CD's.. you rip the cd onto the xbox hard drive.    You can plug your ipod directly into the xbox 360 and use it as an external source of music.

Cocker Spaniel - Trooper, Kipper or Coal (if he's black)  Tiger - Masha (pronounced like Sasha, but with an 'm'), Tigalina   (tie - ga - lee - na) or Mahogany  Tree Frog - Kermit, Forrest or Phileap (leap as in jump. : ) )  Husky - Avalanche, Kodiak (Kodi for short) or Shades (especially  if he has dark patches around his eyes)    I hope you find names you like.

dpRQeob8aa	I believe Prostreet is the best out of the 2. It has the best graphics, cars,   of races, and customization options. However, Undercover 2 is tied with Most Wanted for me for the best in the entire series. Undercover 2 because it has the highest amount of customization out of all the Need for Speeds. Most Wanted because there are almost as many options as Underground 2 but there are more cars AND there are police.|`|ka1TiF5Gaa	nfs underground 1 is the best racing game i have played in my life  by the time it was released that game had excellent graphics, excellent sound and just the right difficulty.  nfs pro street it is not so good, i think you will enjoy more to play underground|`|doVWnwJKaa	i like NFS undercover =D|`|iqVDRH1laa	I prefer NFS Underground because it's fun for customization, but it's really easy. NFS Prostreet is fun for other things, and is really hard. I guess Prostreet.|`|BdbI6SWMaa	Need for Speed Prostreet was just a really bad game. Undercover is a slight improvement but nothing compared to the good ol' NFS games like Underground 1 & 2.    To be honest, if you want a real racing game get Burnout Paradise. Free DLC is coming out even though it was released last year on Febuary 6th and they have all ready added Motor Bikes, Night/Day, Weather Effects in the last few months ect..

Glitches  Drain Skill Trainer Trick  Using this trick will allow you to train any skill to level 100, using any trainer of that skill. It will cost you a one time amount of 330+ gold for the initial Drain Skill spell, plus the amount of 70 gold for each Custom Drain Skill spell you create, plus the price of 1 gold per level raised. So, it will cost you around 500 gold for the first skill raised to level 100, and 165 gold (or less) for each subsequent skill raised to level 100.     First buy a Drain Skill type spell. The Spells are available from Solea Nuccusius in the lower level of Ft. Moonmoth Prison Towers, accessed through a wooden door by Larrius Varro. The spell names are Drain Athletics, Drain Block, and Drain Destruction (Any one spell will do).     Then, go to a Spellmaker, and create a spell to drain one of the 27 Skills, using the following formula:     Drain Skill *   Range: Self   Magnitude: 100 to 100   Duration: 1     * I suggest training the Destruction Skill first, which will increase your chance of casting your Custom Drain Skill spell successfully.     After creating your custom spell, go to any trainer that trains the skill that corresponds to the skill being drained in your spell. Stand directly in front of the Trainer, then cast the spell, and quickly talk to the trainer to train that skill. Since you have lowered that particular skill's level to 0, your price for training will be the default cost of 1 gold. Don't worry about your drained skill, it's stats will quickly return as soon as your 1 second spell wears off. Cast the spell just before you talk to the trainer, each time you train a level, and you will be able to use that trainer to train your skill to level 100, for 1 gold a point. If you use this trick with your Major/Minor Skills you will be able to raise your characters level 1 point for 10 gold, an unlimited amount of times.     Contributed By: Frazzums.  Get the price off your head for free  Join the thieves guild. Drop all of your gold where you can find it easily. In Balmora, talk to the guy behind the counter.

Pick up your gold, and walk a free person    Contributed By: werekiller.  Increase Weapon Skills Glitch  To increase your weapon skill levels to unimaginable levels, simply get a weapon with a ''bound weapon'' enchantment on it(you can enchant it yourself). Then, use the bound weapon spell from the weapon, and then switch through the weapon inventory quickly, by holding X and the left trigger. Everytime the bound weapon goes through your weapon cache, you will gain 10 skill levels for that weapon type. In seconds you can easily be a grand master of that type of weapon.     Note   Sometimes this may not work with just one bound weapon, so get two, and use the same process: Use the spell from both of the weapons, and then go through your cache.

Infinite Scroll Uses!  1) Enter menus (by pressing 'B')   2) Go to the spells page.   3) Select the scroll desired.   4) Go to the inventory page.   5) Drop scrolls (of the same type that you selected in the   spells page)   6) Get out of menus.   7) Cast spell!   8) Pick up scroll(s) off the ground.     *now you have casted the spell, but you have not used the   scroll!

3thcehMGaa	I'm very into the whole 'sims scene' so here's what I've got for you:    The Sims 3 is a completely new concept compared the previous Sims Games. You will be able to create people who are almost identical to yourself and your siblings, straight down to the personality traits. You will be able to live in an open neighborhood, wandering around, fishing, playing on the playground, going to concerts - it's all up to you.     However, all of your Sims in the neighborhood will not be aging at the same time, making it possible to make more than one family just like the other games.     Plus, there is always a cheat to bring back the good old times of Sims 2, the de-aging serum, and the "turnaging off" cheat.    Good luck! Only 18 days left and counting!   Happy simming.|`|DDuLoMWxaa	in the sims 3 all sims in the neighbourhood will age as you play your family and as your siblings plays their family. ie. your sims will age even when your not playing them.   wen u 1st get ur game their will b only 1 neighbourhood called sunset valley.  However if u register your game with EA (instructions will appear to do this before u install the game) then you will get another neighbourhood.   If u register ur game and get the other neighbourhood den u can have a seperate neighbourhood t ur siblings so ur sims wont age wen their on it.     btw. im sure there will be a cheat to stop aging as there was in the sims 2.     + you can create more than one family. otherwise the game wud b boring.     hope this helped x x xx|`|SmUYGGbraa	The is a way to stop aging on the Sims 3.  Of course you are allowed to make more than one family.  When you are playing in one house no one else will grow up in other houses I'm pretty sure.
vRUCNTs7aa	Because you don't know how.    I don't know, do you have the correct drivers for the game.  Have you cleared your cache lately?  Do you have pop-ups disabled?  Can you give any kind of information regarding whether you could ever play them before?  What have you done specific to your computer that may have caused you to be unable to play them?  Have you tried pogo's customer support?  Did you forget your password?  Did somebody sneak into your computer room while you were sleeping and disable left click on your mouse?  Did you delete your account in a fit of rage?  Maybe the underwear gnomes took them by mistake?    A little help on your part would be awesome.

k13V3Xj8aa	How about thinking about "making" the book itself.  If you do some web surfing on "making books" there is way more kinds than just a simple photo album or novel style.     Books can have pockets and be tied with ribbons, the covers can be made with fabrics.  The book can contain pop outs or fold out like accordion.      Or Imagine a board on the back, like  legal pad and two half covers that fold out like double doors each bound to a side of the legal pad.  (not that it's a legal pad, just in that frame of reference of course.) the front cover having two parts would have to be cut vertically in half.   The book can even have it's own special box case, and the book might be wrapped in the baptismal gown that was used. It could have windows cut into the cover or in some of the pages.         Books don't have to even have to be square or rectangle either.  Imagine a book in a circle, it could have a single peg fastener near an edge and open out with a twist and rotating the cover and pages to swing around and out.

FNzQk6veaa	Step1  Test to see if you have 'packing snow,' which clumps together easily and isn't too wet. The snow must pack to make a snowman.  Step2  Shape a handful of snow into a ball. Continue adding more snow and packing the ball until it's too large to hold.  Step3  Place the ball on the snow in front of you and slowly roll it away from you. As more snow accumulates on the outside of your ball, pack the snow by pressing on it with your gloved hands.  Step4  Roll and pack the ball over and over until it is the size you want for the bottom of the snowman's body.  Step5  Repeat for the midsection and head. The bottom should be the biggest ball, and the top should be the smallest.  Step6  Pack some extra snow between the layers to make them stick together. Place sticks down the center where the sections meet if your snowman is having trouble standing erect.  Step7  Give the snowman a face. Use coal, rocks, buttons or anything dark and round for the eyes. A horizontal stick or twig will make a good mouth, and a carrot is fine for the pointy nose. If you don't have a carrot, a banana or a candy cane will do the job.  Step8  Cover the top of his head with an old plant for hair, or give him a knit hat to wear. Top hats will blow away unless secured.  Step9  Add arms, legs and other accessories. Push sticks into the sides of the middle section and hang old mittens on the ends, then place boots at the bottom for legs. Also consider adding items such as a shirt, a scarf or sunglasses.|`|aBLYU5FKaa	You start out with a small ball of snow, and just start rolling it around the yard.  The snow has to be sticky in order for any of this to work.  Anyways... once the ball gets big enough, roll it to where you want the snowman to be, and then make two more balls, each smaller then the one before, and place them on top of each other, biggest on the bottom and smallest on the top.  Get a carrot for the nose, two rocks for eyes, three rocks for buttons, and a bunch of small little rocks for a nose.  Then find 2 sticks for arms, and get a hat, scarf, and gloves.    Then you have a snowman.|`|AKOx8dXBaa	First build a big block of snow about 4 ft wide and 5 ft tall.

Continue west and capture a Floatzel, then   make your way south to the dock. Use the River Flow 1 ability to ride the   stream all the way west and north. Pass the first dock you come to, and   continue northward to the very end. Get onto dry land there, and the Celebi   will appear. Follow it into the next area and it will move around the   circular area. Chase it with a Doduo and try to stay out of the tall grass so   you move faster. Watch its movement patterns and catch up to it, then capture   it.

SeSObtS0aa	You'll need the original World of Warcraft game before you can upgrade your account with The Burning Crusade expansion. You'll also need both original World of Warcraft game and The Burning Crusade expansion before you can upgrade your account with Wrath of the Lich King.      If you intend to purchase the game, I would recommend purchasing the World of Warcraft Battle Chest which costs $39.99 and includes:  1) The original World of Warcraft game  2) The Burning Crusade expansion  3) A World of Warcraft Strategy Guide from Brady Games  4) The Burning Crusade Strategy Guide from Brady Games    It is also possible to begin playing just by purchasing the original World of Warcraft game without any of the expansions; costing you $19.99 only. You'll not need to purchase The Burning Crusade expansion until you reach Level 60 and Wrath of the Lich King expansion only when you reach Level 70.    You might like to note that the original World of Warcraft game includes 30 days of game time; while no additional game time is provided when upgrading your account with The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King expansions.      Is there a monthly fee to play the game?  Yes. After the end of the free month included with the game, you need a subscription in order to continue playing the game. There are three subscription options: a month-to-month package at $14.99 per month, a three-month plan at $13.99 per month, and a six-month plan at $12.99 per month.    Are there multiple methods of payment?  Yes, customers can pay their subscription fees using credit cards, PayPal, and pre-paid game cards, which can be purchased in many game and electronics stores.    Prepaid Game Cards make great gifts and are an easy way to create a new subscription or extend an existing one. These cards retail in most game stores for $29.99 and add 60 calendar days of play time to an account.      Finally, should you still be keen in purchasing the game, please allow me to recruit you via the Recruit-A-Friend program (click on my avatar and check my profile to contact me). You'll receive a special trial Authentication Key that would provide you with 10 days of free game time and the recruiter would be rewarded 30 days of free game time after you purchase the game and begin your subscription.

Here's a map showing it's approximate location: http://www.uesp.net/maps/obmap/obmap.sht...      And like the first guy said, you can't play Oblivion online, no matter what system it's on. I have it for the PS3, and I can't play it online    Also, the Assassin's Guild is my favorite guild, the quests are really fun and they pay well, so I highly recommend doing their quests ( don't do them all at once though, some of the rewards are better at higher levels)|`|AwLXD7eYaa	Fist of all Rufio is in  the ill omen inn on the road inbetween bravil and the imperial city. hes downstairs from 6am to 2am.    and you cant play online sorry i wish i was

K81H2emuaa	that would be avalanche : ) your welcome|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Well, I would say probably Avalanch. But if you don't find it in that search try to look under adventure games. There is Avalanch 2: Don't Fall Down. I can't remember the name too well of it. But I think it was Reserica. That is just like Avalanch but it came before it. Avalanch and Reserica are the same games. But Avalanch you can do more things. I think it is one of them. Try searching Avalanch if not work then search Avalanch 2: Don't Fall Down. If not search Avalanch Reserection and see if it has a 3rd one or 4th. But Reserica is the first game to ever be posted on addictinggames.com. It depends which one. If you still can't find anything try searching Reserica. Than if not go under Adventure Games. If not found yet you could try calling the company at 9-735-227-2873. But I am pretty sure you'll find it before then. Catcha' later!|`|cmpQwGsfaa	Avalanche.    10 Points.

X7KjqVy5aa	The Secret Slab, or Secret Stone Plate as you call it, is an item to be used like items that you trade with Croagunk. In order to use it, all you have to do is have the item in your inventory. You were doing what you were supposed to when you went to Amp Plains. Zapdos should appear there, but it's not 100%. You may have to try a couple of times for it to appear. But, do not press "Use" again when you have another one. "Using" it will result in it disappearing much like one use items do. So, if you just keep searching around, Zapdos should eventually appear. Hope this helps. Good Luck.
MqoQiLcuaa	Fallout 3 - Great action - freedom to be or do whatever you want - great main quest - plenty of Misc quests - only thing is it isn't online.

JHEvQ3Ckaa	Hm. It could be the core of the Rubik's cube. The core is the center of the Rubik's cube. It part inside it could be broken or stuck and you may have to replace it. Since you did not put anything inside it, it cannot get stuck unless its the inside mechanism for it.     Also, it could be some stuff inside the cube. The stuff inside it gets builded up from being used. With your sweaty palms and loaning it to other friends who also solve it without cleaning their hands can build up the stuff inside it and eventually make the cube harder to turn.    HOWEVER, try the steps below to try to "clean" the cube and see if it works.      1.Take apart the cube. Just twist the top and use a key to pop out a piece off. Take the rest off.    2. Check each piece and wipe a piece with a tissue etc. If its black, then you might have some "gunk" builded up inside.     3. Very carefully, using a towel and some water, wet and wipe off each piece. Don't wash the middle of the cube which is the center for each side.    4. Each piece should be dry. Then put the cube back together.    5. If the steps do not work and you still need to use all your strength to turn it, Replace it.
vtJDHJDYaa	No, they are not dubbed in the sense they directly translated it in English. They went through the trouble of looking for the old and new voice actors of Kingdom Hearts and put them together for the production again.

7euhYK0Jaa	Video games are well, games. Except they are usually shown on a screen on TV, computer, or the screen of a handheld. Some games can be played in a DVD player but it has to say so. A console is also refered as a system. They play video games and tend to be expensive. Playstation 3 has the best HD and play Blu-ray disks along with games its the most expensive and lack the ability to play disks from its predecessors, but you can download the originals onto the PS3. The XBOX 360 has a bunch of different models depending on your preferences like some have higher difintion than others and some require memory cards because of a lack of a built in Hard drives. It has a larger selection of games but most are not kid oriented. The Nintendo Wii is the cheapest and has a lot of games suited for kids and has more interactivity than other games. It doesn't have a very high resolution though.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	a video game is any game you run either on your computer or with any of the major game consoles  they come in several formats like first person shooters   strategy games either turn based or real time   role playing game- RPG   world of warcraft or everquest>    consoles are the system you use to play any of the above games on  other than your computer and usually hook up to your TV  Xbox, Playstation, Sega, Nintendo-game cube or Wii   these often have accessories to play other types of games like   Guitar Hero - guitar or drum set     there is a new type of board game that uses your DVD player to play the game     of course there always the traditional roleplaying games out like D&D  and many others incluing live action versions called LARP's    happy gaming|`|0Hx7hWqLaa	well no offence but ive never met somone hu didnt know be4  at a store like ebgames, gamestop, wallmart u can buy a cosole for $100-500 but it dependo what it is . a Nintendo ds is a portable console , handheld whith double screen and one of them is a touch screen it can not onli play the ds games but it can play old gameboy games. a playstation, xbox or nintendo wii however are plugged into ur television and are NOT portable .

If your account has expired for over 90 days, please allow me to send you a Scroll of Resurrection when you're ready to resume your subscription (click on my avatar and check my profile to contact me). It will provide you with 10 days of free game time, but only before you resume your subscription or add game time to your account.    If you're new to World of Warcraft, you'll like to note you'll need to purchase the original World of Warcraft game before you can upgrade your account with The Burning Crusade expansion. If this is the case, please allow me to recruit you via the Recruit-A-Friend program (click on my avatar and check my profile to contact me). You'll receive a special trial Authentication Key that would provide you with 10 days of free game time to start your account and the recruiter would be rewarded 30 days of free game time after you purchase the game and begin your subscription.

You can play the credit song or just let it play, you will have to play it in the bonus gig again anyway. After the credits are done, one gig will appear. After completing that gig one additional gig will appear. That's where the missing songs are. Hope that helps.

wla6S5aGaa	Critical Mass (CM) occurs after you destroy several crystals during a single stage of the game. All monsters are able to reach CM and to my knowledge affects them all the same.    The effects of CM are an increase to damage output, but at a cost of a decrease in defense.     Personally, I didn't notice much difference, but then again, I returned my copy of the game a week after I purchased it.

These are the Wiis good points:  Now one question I've been hearing is, "Why change the name of the system from Revolution to Wii?"  Nintendo did this to make the Wii's name universal and to emply the "fun" element of the new system.  No matter what country you visit, everyone will know the Wii as "Weeeee!", but the Revolution would have to be translated.    First of all, the game's name being universal is just the start.  The system itself is universal, being able to be played by children to old adults.  Now think about this, the game's controller is just  a remote control that has a sensor built into it.  Considering the extra nunchuk controller that can be purchased along with the system, the controller type increases the range of the audience the system can appeal to.  No more are complicated controls and buttons needed.  If you need to swing a golf club, you just swing, if you need to slash with a sword, you just stab with it, and if you need to shoot a gun, you just aim and shoot.  Children can easily catch on to the game's mechanics while older players can easily use the controls without being overwhelm with complicated controls.      Secondly, the game line-up for the Wii is going to be great as well.  A few examples are Red Steel, a game based on Yakuza with gun play and sword-swingin' action, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, featuring the classic characters plus Wario, Kid Icarius, and...  (Drum Role please)  Solid Snake!!!  I've also heard about a new Mario game coming out, a version of the Legend of Zelda:  Twilight Princess readapted for the Wii, and an array of sports games.    Finally, the Gamecube's anti-backwards compatability are no more.  The Wii will not only have wireless Wii controllers, but also slots for four gamecube controllers.  The system will also be able to accept the standard Wii discs as well as the small gamecube discs.      My final thoughts are that the Wii is definitely going to be a competetor.  It is said that the Wii will be the cheapest system, but I don't know for sure and don't want you to quote me on that.  However, if you want a system that is truly going to be what a next generation console should be,  pick up the Wii this year.  I mean, how much better can graphics get?  My opinion is:  not much better.  The Wii is the only system that will revolutionize not only graphics (like the other two systems,  Snoooorrreee....) but also the way we play video games as well.  Peace Out  and Good Luck...|`|AA11944370	well the price compared to the other systems i hear is going to be good and the wiimote also is a strong point but not much is known yet oh and the games|`|ea6495130b32b11c51b2ec19d76d87e2aa	Something different.  The evolution of gaming has been fairly mudane, with the exception of online play it has only gotten faster and nicer looking.  I saw kudos to Nintendo for thinking outside the box and possibly starting a new revolution in gaming.  The way they design their controller was different, with the motion sensors, built-in speaker etc...now games have to be thought of in a different way, not just revamp graphics and add a sword or a level here or there.|`|10ba3088d91eeff2aae3be516f8585c4aa	First off it's going to be around 250 bucks that's a lot cheaper than PS3 and the 360. Second of all the new controller is something to really look forward to. Also, great launch titles, along with new Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Brothers: brawlers with 5 or 6 new characters...
AA11622823	The DS Lite is more compact (smaller, same screen size though), has more settings of brightness (including BRIGHTER settings), and...That's about it.  It has a few design changes that make sense as well, for example, the microphone is in the center of the DS Lite instead of the left bottom like it was on the DS.    Worth getting one if you already have a regular DS?  No, not really.    Worth getting if you don't have a DS and want to buy one?  Definitely.  Nice improvements.  Also easier to fit into your pocket.  The old DS is a little bit too bulky for pocket carrying.|`|29575138fce7f69706c4b3a917c6fef5aa	The ds Lite is smaller and with a slightly larger, brighter screens.  I'm going to trade in my old ds for the new one!!|`|6970d01b657851590a8ed303ad5982e2aa	The ds lite is brighter and lighter then the orginal ds. The colors are better too on the ds lite, and the visual angle is also better. The stylus pen for the ds lite is longer and thicker, which relieves me of all those wonderful cramps i get in my hands when i play my regular ds. I imported the ds lite from japan, and the ds lite wins hands down. But of course the release of the ds lite will mean a drop in the ds price, another thing to consider|`|AA11426274	The DS Lite has a brighter screen and wheighs lighter, I think those are the only differences. They cost about the same as a regular DS.|`|7f8389a753feea5b496c6ac4cf146b6aaa	DS Lite has less calories.|`|d5bdc7886fc23eb2e2cc4f9196d678f9aa	the ds lite is the same thing as a ds except that it is smaller and lighter. the screen is the same size but the ds size is smaller. i am thinking of getting the lite|`|c65225970f0aa83bfbf82963b0626e2eaa	I didn't even get the regular DS when it came out...I didn't see the point of it. Two screens? That's WAY too complicated for a video game...ATARI RULES!|`|b305c82d737114d77c1f17948aebbb90aa	The DS Lite has four different levels of brightness (on max brightness it is BRIGHT!)  The system is overall thinner and lighter in weight.  The power button has been moved to the side.  Start and   select are now smaller buttons moved under the ABYX buttons.  Also moved is the mic button... it used to be on the bottom lip of the system and now it is smack dab in the middle of the unit between the screens.  Oh and the stylus is thicker and now slides out of the  bottom right side.    Am I going to buy one?  I always thought the DS was sorta cool, but I never wanted one.  Having spent time playing with the "Lite," I really want one.|`|AA12127363	The nintendo ds will have built in wifi so that you won't have to buy an adapter to play online game with people.  All you need is the ds lite and a wireless router.
