20090307102526AAPp2ic	Social Science;Psychology	I had a dream where I was melting what does this mean?	I recall slowly approaching an 18th century protestant church (I am not protestant) made of wood, painted white. There is extensive activity outside amongst the townsfolk, who furnish typical 18th century colonial attire. I remember the hats particularly well, they appear to be felt hats of the clerical style, but I could very well be incorrect. I enter the structure, and I see nothing but candles, candles from wall to wall, and they are all within these massive cabinets which are stained black from all the soot of these seemingly endless fires. Every single candle was burning, I approached one of the openings for a closer observation, and somehow one of the candles is extinguished. Immediately afterwards I enter a third person view point and I observe myself melting. Somehow I continue to proceed outside of the church as I take the form of a molten candle, until I awaken, it was around four thirty in the morning. I cannot recall having experienced anything significant which could trigger such an experience.

20090307103119AABEj4K	Social Science;Psychology	This is a problem, what should I do?	When a guy starts to like me and it shows, I usually instantly reject them, stop talking to them completely and ignore them. But sometimes I start to like the guy when they start to back off. But I get scared and freak out and hate it when someone likes me. I want a bf, but at this rate, I'll never get one. What's my problem and what can/should I do?

20070120091604AAutla0	Social Science;Psychology	What do you get when you cross Aperger's and ADHD?	My son has been diagnosed with ADHD, with a suspicion of Asperger's syndrome thrown in.  The Asperger's wasn't not formally diagnosed as such, but the signs/symptoms are undeniable.  It's just mild.  Needless to say, life has been tough on the poor kid.        I have found that I can really relate to most of his struggles, as I have experienced them in some form myself.  The chronic disorganization of the ADHD sufferer combined with the social retardation of the Asperger's victim.  Since I was a child I have always felt I was an "outsider".  But for myself, I was also found to be gifted with a high IQ.  School work was not hard, I loved to learn, and I crave knowledge.  I can focus on things I enjoy with great patience and truly like certain mind-numbing tasks.  I can become so absorbed in a book that someone will call me several times before I hear them.  But other aspects of my life are a mess!  Is it possible that I have all 3??  ADHD, AS, and gifted?  If I do, that really sucks.

20070610000243AAXNZOE	Social Science;Psychology	Anxiety attacks increased.. would like helpful advice?	I have suffered from bad anxiety attacks for the past 10-15 years. For the last 7-8 I have been taking both Zolof and Clozopan for this and I was duing things I never thought possible. Then about 7 months back I started having the attacks again and they have increased to the point where they are probably an 8-9 on a level 1-10 in how scared I am, rarely before did I ever have this level of attacks and they are also more common almost having smaller ones on a daily basis.      I noticed when I was taking a medication called Accutane, for acne, things started happening, and I am not sure if this screwed me up but I stopped taking it and things have continued. Since my anxiety had previously stopped years back I don't see a therapist anymore but had to find a new one and he doesn't do anything at all for me. He is a Psychatrist and didn't change my medication and I really need help.       If anyone can help I would appreciate advice.

20090227135913AAmmTPI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone help me interpret my dream?	I had a really strange dream last night.   I was away at boarding school, and was living in this dorm that looked like a giant house. I was in a really bad accident and hurt my hip and was on crutches. While walking into the kitchen one morning, a blonde cheerleader tripped me. I hit her by accident as a fell, but I ended up getting in trouble for it. Standing back up, I walked outside, where it suddenly turned to night, and I began walking alongside a broken fence that led nowhere. I finally sat down on an uneven bench, and out of nowhere, a girl with black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin, sat down, and starts talking to me. I then get up, and walk back into the dorm, and into the bedroom. As I'm laying in my bed, the cheerleader who tripped me came in and apologized. Giving her a dirty look, I screamed at her, "Do you know what you did? I'm going to be on these crutches for over a year now!"   Now normally, I would just brush off a dream like this, but for some reason, it's been stuck in my head all day, and its been driving me crazy! Can someone tell me what it means? Thanks!
20090227141419AAMEe62	Social Science;Psychology	I had a dream about my teacher, can someone tell me what it means?	I have consistent dreams about my teacher hugging me and then kissing me on my cheek, my hand or my forehead.      Around a year and a half ago I used to think I had fallen in love with him which caused me to cry in realisation that he will never be interested in me and for the fact that he's older than me AND my teacher, but that was in the past. He knew how I felt but never really  took it seriously instead he took it as a compliment.      Things have changed now and I feel like I've moved on from the feelings I had for him but I keep having dreams about him telling me he loves me and then kissing me, and I just stand there and let him do that (in the dream) and then I just wake up to 8:00am in the morning. What does that mean?

20081012123234AAMMgdO	Social Science;Economics	Which candidate would be the most beneficial to our economy?	Obama claims that cutting taxes to the middle class while increasing taxes among the more wealthy will do the most to boost the economy through increased spending. McCain says that increasing taxes among the wealthy will result in higher prices and fewer jobs. I have not studied economics for over six years, and I am a bit rusty. Both arguments seem to make sense on the surface, but seeing as how they contradict each other, one must be better than the other. I am looking for answers I can learn a few things from, not just short, biased, "My candidate is better" answers. The best answer will be picked based on which seems the most insightful after a little research on my part.

20080928172128AAt55Fw	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	PLEASE help me interpret this dream?	Ok.. in my dream i got out of bed and there was no one in the house, i went outside to see if my parents' car was in the driveway. I tried to go back into the house but the door just disapeared, so i started to run away from the house towards the park that is across the street. It was summer but the pond in the middle of the park was frozen so i tried walking over the frozen pond to get to the other side of the street but my sneakers got stuck. I started to call for help for what seemed to be an hour finally these cops who had the faces of dogs appeared with saws came over. i thought that they were going to cut the ice from around me but they ended up cutting my ankels. It was weird because i didn't even notice until i looked down and my shoes were still stuck on the ice. There was no blood either, when I looked at my severed leg it looked like the bottom of a lego piece for some odd reason. the dog face cops just kinda waddled and disappeared without saying anything. i ran back to my house but it wasn't there.. it wasn't even the same place... i swore i was running in the right direction but there was just a big empty field. i turned around to go back to the park with the frozen pond but it wasn't there either, it was like i was transported to a field. i was walking and walking and walking until i saw this giant black bird flying around. i thought it was going to kill me, or eat me but it just flew around for a while until is came down and grabbed me by my shoulders. the large black bird started talking to me and told me "you're going to be ok, i promise" he went up into the clouds and then dropped me down, i was falling and then i fell into a large hole that looked like an inactive volcano. i landed on a bed that was at the bottom of the volcano and i realized that the bed and everything around me was just like it was in my room. I looked up to see the volcano hole but it was gone. my tv was on and i remember that on the tv the song pretty noose by soundgarden was playing.. ok here is where it gets weird... i walk out of my room and go down the stairs and it's like the first floor of my house turned into a wendys fastfood resturant and everyone in the resurant looked like my exGf. For some reason i wasn't weirded out and I decided to order. I ordered a go-wrap and right when I was about to take a bite out of it, i looked around and all these exgf looking people were looking at me in a weird way, as if they did something to the go-wrap. I opened the go-wrap and instead of chicken, there was teeth that were being held together by what looked like pink gum. i started to puke and my puke was like acid and started melting the table that i was sitting on, and even the chairs. all of the workers and people in the wendys were mad that i puked and they started running towards me... i started to run and use my puke to keep them away.. i ran back up to my room and locked my door. my tv turned into this huge monster with teeth and started jumping towards me, i jumped out of the window with my lego feet and landed hard on the ground, i was able to drag myself to the street when i saw this lady also on the ground. she was about... 30 feet away and her arm started to stretch. her face was on the ground but her hand was stretching right towards me i started to scream and tried dragging myself away but the hand was coming faster and faster.. it finally touched me and i passed out. i turned up in the hospital and i was like a little kid (5 years old) my parents where there and my grandfather (who died) was there. i was half up and half asleep but i heard them say that i was probably going to die tonight so to start planning for my funeral. tears started to run down my face when i heard them walking away i opened my eyes a little, i didn't want them to know that i heard them, and then my grandfather quickly turned his head and he had these HUGE eyes that were totally black and i totally freaked out. I jumped out of bed and somehow got stuck in this big hugs spiderweb. my grandfather with the huge eyes turned around and they all left the room even though i was screaming. the rest of the room turned black, and it was like i was all alone on this web, there was a spotlight that i saw from far, when i looked around it was like the web was going on forever.. i started to feel the web tremble and then i saw a huge spider leg the spider started to eat me from head to toe, and eventhough i couldn't see the spider and my head seemed to be eaten i saw the rest of me get eaten (btw i have normal feet now, no more lego feet). everything gets quiet and there's just a lot of darkness... just then i hear a voice telling me... DO YOU WANT MUSTARD WITH THAT, and that's when i woke up. (there's some stuff in there that i don't remember perfectly but its pretty much how it went down)

He talks to these two women in front of me, they are friends of his and he goes all smarmy admiring their make up.He cuts me out completely so I move away a bit to let him at it, I notice him looking over and grinning to himself. One of them is very pretty, so when the girls are gone, I just say that she is a very pretty girl and the makeup thing suits her. He gets pissed off with me? Hello? 'Yeah the makeup looks well, very artistic', he says but it obviously pissed at me. WTF? I couldn't have been more normal if I tried and did not behave in any way jealous. What gives?

20090307105308AA4ChOI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	Okay so I'm going to give you a little background info of whats going on in my life,so things may make a little more sense to you.    I'm a freshman in high school.Last night I went out of town with some friends.My ex went,whom I broke up with about 5 months ago,went also.He's about a year and a half older than me,and we dont go to the same school,and we really only started talking to each other about a month ago.By the end of the night things were great.We were laughing and having fun like old times.I'm thinking of giving it another chance.I'm gonna call him guy 1   The other part you need to know is about a guy that I just recently met about a month or so ago. He's in my fourth period and we eat lunch together about everyday.He's started talking to me about some of the things going on in his life.And I was the first one he called when he broke up w/ his gf.He wants to hang out,and I do to,but I'm not sure if I should b/c he still as a chance of getting back with is ex.I'm gonna call him guy 2.      So my dream(I know this a lot,bare with me):   It was raining one day after school and I had a softball game. Guy 2 was there with me and wanted to give me a ride to my game so I wouldnt have to walk to the field(our school is set up weird). I was hesitating be/c I knew that guy 1 was going to be there. Guy 2 said "fine I'll just walk with you" He picked me up cradle style, and started to carry me in the pouring rain. I was laughing and then I asked him about his ex,and if they we're still talking or planning on getting back together. He looked at me for a second and then he kissed me and smiled. Then I woke up.   What does my dream mean?   What do you think I should do in my real life situation?

20090307105919AAk94WB	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Explain my frightful dream?	Okay, so just last night I went to bed and kept waking up to these horrible dreams that scared me to death, I remember them because I kept waking up during one, and then going back to bed and experiencing another one. Well my first one is WEIRD. Because my friends and I were at this college dorm building, and this man who had glasses and dirty blonde hair, looked to be in his 30's asked if he could have sex with me, and in this dream I saw an older version of myself. (I`m not in college yet) and I told that guy NO, and was going to report him, and then one of my friends came out and admitted to me that she had been raped by him before. He left before we could have him questioned by authorities, and that was the end of that dream. What scares me is that the dream felt so real, and I actually saw myself, and I've had dreams before that I would dream, and then they would happen. Like my best friend's mom. I had a dream that she was going to die and it happened. IT FREAKS ME OUT! help me please. I need explanations.
