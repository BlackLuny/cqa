eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	As far as current events go, the most babies born at one time (the Suleman Octuplets) is currently a very timely popular topic with news commentators and in editorial columns. <br>  <br>  I also heard on the news this week that some one had set a world record for holding his/her breath underwater.  <br>  <br>  You might want to look at the Guinness World Records' web site.
G7N7iG3oaa	killer angels by michael shaara<br>  <br>  this is a book about the battle of gettysburg in the civil war. it is from the point of view of many of the major players in the battle and really lets you get an inside look at possibly the most crucial battle of the civil war. the characters are based on shaara's interpretations of the real people based on documents and other works to help him get an idea of their personality. not only is it a great, fast paced read, it is also very accurate. hope this helps... =)|`|vmmMqhxXaa	A Little History of the World, by E.H. Gombrich<br>  <br>  I know you said centering around a certain event, and this is anything but that, but believe me, it's an inspired gift for a history buff.  It was written by a 26-year-old who was working on his doctoral thesis in Art History.  He was asked by a young friend to explain what he was working on, and the result was this incredible book.  It starts with prehistory (cavemen) and progresses through time to the Atomic Age.  Along the way, it describes everything from the culture of the Pharoahs to the tenets of the world's major religions.<br>  <br>  Tell your boyfriend not to be fooled by the fact that this was written in terms that children can understand.  My husband and I are reading it aloud to our 9-year-olds, and we're ALL learning something every night -- including my husband, who was a history major!|`|XgH9uuv9aa	This does look mostly at a single event but it may be of interest, it's certainly new.
ApZ0qS88aa	Because you don't know a lot.<br>  <br>  Off the top of my head:<br>  <br>  Gurkhas - Nepal (India-ish)<br>  Spartans - Peloponnese (Greece)<br>  Aztecs - Mexico/Cental America<br>  Apache - American South West<br>  The ROMANS<br>  <br>  For that matter: Most anything Japanese, Japan being  mostly humid subtropical.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  For the record, Vikings were a civilization in and of themselves and not really a military order:<br>  <br>  Cuachicqueh (The Shorn Ones) An elite Aztec military order, sworn not to take a step backwards in battle on pain of death at the hands of their comrades.<br>  <br>  Spartan society was not divided in such a way that one could separate out the warriors from the non warriors because, at least in theory, there was no Spartan male who wasn't a warrior and while their most elite formation was the Phalanx that doesn't fit well as a name for a Spartan warrior, nor does any other as "Spartan Warrior" is a redundant term.<br>  <br>  The Apache, being a nomadic hunter-gatherer society did not seemingly have a distinct military class, but that doesn't mean that they did not distinguish themselves as a powerful force to be reckoned with throughout their history.<br>  <br>  Again, the Romans, especially of the republican era, distinguished themselves militarily time and again with military service being an integral part of Roman public life and one who hadn't served militarily could scarcely have been considered "Roman" Their military formation was the Legion however like Sparta it is as a society and civilization on the whole and not simply a military unit that Romans distinguished themselves as warriors.<br>  <br>  I think it's clear that the crux of your point was not that we don't know their names but rather that these societies did not produce warriors of equal clout to those we see romanticized in our popular culture.
uq1GXvSdaa	i love the whole universe of Harry Potter . but i'm no fan of Harry Potter himself<br>  He was arrogant in some ways, lazy, and a cheater.|`|y5xrKPxMaa	Harry Potter himself or the book? well as himself i like his character its serious yet funny aty the same time and as in thw book i think its a great book, J.K Rowling is a good writer. A great book to get lost in if you know what i mean =)|`|WT5jdIkxaa	bit of a bland open question isn't it. <br>  <br>  i think the books are amazing, complete Genius from J K Rowling. She manages to create a unique, interesting and captivating world that has enthralled millions worldwide. <br>  <br>  the books are well written and draw the reader in extremely well. you actually feel like you are a part of the magical world, and that you know each character. she explains the plot, characters, places and objects very well and tells the story wonderfully; there is always another twist coming up. <br>  <br>  there is just no limit to her imagination, she has trully created works of art that will be around for decades and probably centuries to come. <br>  <br>  as for the movies.....they should never have been made, you cannot portray the world created in the books onto a tv. vital inforrmation is missed out and too much changed. you need to read the books and imagine the world for yourself, the way it is intended.|`|aBh7uZkuaa	I LOVE IT!!<br>  <br>  1)awesome plot<br>  2)awesome character<br>  3)great book<br>  <br>  it's the best series i ever read=P|`|Oi28Agu3aa	He is ugly.<br>  =)|`|UvkF2pZraa	i dont like it at all

O9HLoDj9aa	Yeah, I think almost everything has a reaction for every action. I'm not sure. You'll never know what would've happened if you would've eaten the grape!|`|piHVQmXdaa	Well yes, I believe every action has a reaction, but the reaction could be an equally insignificant one. For instance if I forgot my lunch one day, I'd have to buy it the cafe, which could stop me from spending that money on something else later. It's hardly a life changing event that I forgot my lunch, but it did have an effect.<br>  However that being said I'm not one to look back on my life and say "If only I had done that differently" because we can never know what would have happened if we'd taken a different route.|`|Bqc86DRQaa	Yes, you would have had your son if you didn't eat that grape. He was meant to be in your life and so he is.<br>  And according to Newton every action has not only a reaction, but an equal and opposite one. <br>  A butterfly flap in Asia produces so little energy there are more forces acting upon it than it against the forces. If you had all the energy of all the butterflies in Asia well, then, maybe. But, every action we take puts us in sequence of events that directly affects our lives and those lives around us.|`|wuiy45Wsaa	Yes. But it's not directly linked. Every action is a reaction as well as a cause. Everything's joined and connected. Makes perfect sense :)|`|fgsVyB0Naa	I do think that most decisions play a role in our future. wheather critical or not i dont know. But I have to agree eating grapes doesnt seem to have a big affect.|`|9ttS1p1Iaa	Yes, every action has a reaction. a reaction is always present after making an action. in fact, in every act that we make, there's always this follow-up action by the other person to whom we address our actions.|`|2LQQMzmpaa	I believe MOST actions do have reactions. That movie is amazing! Its my favorite. hah, I am sure you would have your son with or without eating the grape.|`|AA11635601	No, I think some actions have no real effect - like whether you or I scratch our nose in the next five mins - you know, we'll get a scratch, but beyond that, who cares.  No further consequence -
JIiKl3L8aa	Ted Turner was the moving force behind the proposed trilogy, but I am unaware of the third ever being done|`|aqeWwA71aa	No - haven't a clue - but thanx for the tip on the movies.  I hadn't heard of them.|`|Zk8fIbxiaa	Gettysburg was a film based on the novel “The Killer Angels” by Michael Shaara.  After his death, his son, Jeffrey Shaara wrote a prequel and a sequel: “God’s and Generals” and “The Last Full Measure” respectively.  “God’s and Generals” was also made into a film.  The film did not do very well at the box office, (although I liked it.)  So that may be why the third book has not been made into a film yet.<br>  <br>  Do not despair, the film may yet be made, as Ted Turners’ ventures are rarely determined by public opinion.  Besides, 10 years passed between the making of the first and the second films, by that time line we have until 2013.

That's not to say any other attributes don't apply, but if a man is in the mall on a Saturday afternoon, a woman's physical attributes will attract him first.  If you get to a point where you're conversing with this femme fatale,  personality traits become extremely important.  Is what she says important to me?  Does she seem interested in what I say?  You don't have to agree with her views, but can you at least relate on an intellectual level?  As you get to know her better, do you share common values?  Are you politically compatible (deson't mean you agree; just means you can listen to each others point of view)?  Finally, when you leave her presence, do you feel a little less complete?  The night met my wife, I knew she was the one; don't ask me how...I just knew.  We've been toogether 19 years now and I'd still rather spend time with her than anyone else!  You'll know a girl is special without asking this question.

If Harry had never tried to save the stone in the first place, it would have never been in danger of being found, seeing as Voldemort had to want to Find the stone and not want to Use it. But since Harry was There, and managed to get the stone, Voldemort could steal it. It was just pure luck he didn't get it.

y8bFwXZEaa	No creature has an afterlife. Epistemologically it is impossible. Metaphysically it is an ugly conception, and drives men to commit terrible acts under the leadership of their god and in his name.<br>  <br>  Ethically it is irrational to even want an afterlife, because it is always perceived as the means of "escaping" the bonds of being a material creature. <br>  <br>  Instead, we should revel in being material because once our central nervous system shuts down, so does our consciousness and with it goes its product, our metaphysical spirit.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a reified soul, except as the determinists define it, and they hate the word 'soul' because it conjures up ideas of supernaturalism. <br>  <br>  For me, "soul" is a metaphysical concept that means the emotional connection one has with his conscience. If you harm your own character or integrity, don't you feel it as pain? When you get married isn't your emotional state "happy"? That place where the feeling is, and where your conscience taps you on the shoulder, is your soul.<br>  <br>  But when you're gone, so it goes with you.|`|cffff382d2e0b895b652fd3f8e2bb31baa	NO.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Saint Michael, the Archangel (or chief angel of all the angels), is the field commander of God's army mentioned by name in Daniel and Revelations.  His feast day, also known as Michaelmas, is 29 September among Roman Catholics and Lutherans while his feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 8 November.<br>  <br>  As the Christian angel of death, he <br>  ---fights against Satan,<br>  ---rescues the souls of the faithful from the enemy at the hour of death,<br>  ---acts as the champion of God's people: the Jews in the Old Testament, the Christians in the New Testament,<br>  ---brings souls to judgment.<br>  <br>  In the late Middle Ages, Michael was the patron saint of chivalry along with Saint George; he is also often seen as the patron saint of police officers and soldiers.

0RvtrkYOaa	To answer the first question, it has to do with distance, plain and simple.  Japan didn't have the ships, manpower, or supplies to undertake such an attack.  Any invasion would had used up all their ships and manpower and would have had to travel thousands of miles to attack the mainland.  It's a foolish move.<br>  <br>  As for the carriers, at the time of the attack the US had seven carriers, which were split between the Pacific and Atlantic fleets, three and four respectively.  The Wasp, Hornet, Yorktown and Ranger were part of the Atlantic fleet, in case Germany declared war, or attacked the US had a large naval presence (at the time fleet carries were still considered for hunting U-boats).<br>  <br>  That leaves three carriers, the Saratoga (at California having completed a refit) and the Lexington and Enterprise (which as to be back on the 6th of dec but delayed because of bad weather).  These remaining two carriers were ferrying planes to Wake and Midway island for the higher priority to protect the ferrying of B-17s from the US mainland to the Philippines.  They could fly landing at several bases without having to go weeks by ship.  The squadrons would protect the bombers and the airbases from Japanese attack.  (In fact one of these flights arrived on dec. 7, and it was that flight which radar operators mistook when they spotted the Japanese planes.)  Just plain dumb luck.|`|5e4128b4467dc1e4a649639d0626f4afaa	By 1941 the US had blocked oil and steel shipments to Japan in retaliation for Japans continued occupation of China.  Japan needed raw materials to run their military machine, and with the US blocking its shipments, they looked for other sources to sustain their military offensives.<br>  <br>  The best sources were Southeast Asia and the Dutch East Indies.  But to conquer and control these areas Japan had to remove their largest defender - the US Navy.  This is the reason for the attack on Pearl Harbor.<br>  <br>  As for the carriers, it was a coincidence - lucky for the US and very unlucky for the Japanese.  These carriers later played a huge part in rolling back the Japanese in the Pacific.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Hawaii was pretty much at the edge of their operating range, the west coast was simply too far away. These weren't nuclear powered sips, it would have meant rendezvousing with oilers deep inside sea lanes where American land based air and American subs ranged freely. A serious Japanese attack on the West Coast was not logistically possible. <br>  <br>  May have been a coincidence, may not have been. We had broken the Japanese diplomatic code before the war, if we had also broken their military code (the government has never confirmed or denied this) we may very well have known the attack was coming and gotten the carriers to safety. They wouldn't have moved the battleships because everyone knew battleships were unsinkable, especially in a base protected by the Army Air Corps and Naval aviators.
ac3561c0ed6428f357981b995404a2b1aa	Don't worry too much about cliches. Main plot isn[t the biggest factor in how good a story is. It's said that there are only seven stories - i.e. seven main types of story.

TjjPm5P1aa	Depends on the Age group... <br>  <br>  To Older Teens and Adults I would recommend...<br>  <br>  The Southern vampire series by Charlaine Harris.(aka. Sookie Stackhouse series.) 9 books so far, next book releases May 2009 Includes many different supernatural beings (werewolves, Vampires, Shapeshifters, faries) . It is very good! HBO's True Blood Series is based off this series. (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  The Anita Blake- Vampire Hunter Series by Laurell Hamilton. 16 books so far I believe. If you like Southern vampires series, you will definately like this one too. Along the same lines however Anita Blake is one tough cookie! (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  Vampire Academy Series- by Richelle Mead- Vampire Academy, Frostbite, shadow kiss (next one comes out in August 2009). Very good series! Would classify this as older teens and up. Very entertaining! (main characters are 17 years old)<br>  <br>  Black Dagger Brotherhood Series- by .R. Ward- 6 books. First one is Dark Lover. About 6 extreamly tough warrior vampires. Each book is based on a different brother however they should still be read in order. I would classify this as adult due to the sex scenes but an older teen would definately enjoy it as well. (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  For Young Adults, I would recommend...<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series- by Melissa De La Cruz- Blue Bloods, Masquerade, Revelations (next book comes out 9/1/09). Main characters are in high School.<br>  <br>  Night Word Series- by L.J. Smith- 3 volumes so far that have three books a piece in them. The stories are all interlinked in one way or another in the "Night World" however the same characters dont tend to repeat between the stories. The world stays the same but i think of them as all seperate books. Each book was entertaining though. Main characters are in high school.<br>  <br>  Vampire Kisses Series by Ellen Schreiber- 5 books so far- next book coming out in the summer of 2009. main characters are in high school.<br>  <br>  The Vampire Diaries Series by L.J. Smith- 4 books so far- Main characters are in high school.|`|5oAU7S9zaa	Need by Carrie Jones-<br>  <br>   Zara collects phobias the way other high school girls collect lipsticks.

I am on Betrayed, I think the series is awesome!<br>  <br>  Okay: I only have three series for you, but they are pretty awesome. <br>  <br>  The first:<br>  Vampire Academy<br>  Frostbite<br>  Shadow Kissed<br>  A series written by Richelle Mead.<br>  <br>  They are about a girl who is a dhampir, hald Moroi (Full vampire) half human. The whole relationship with these three species if kind of confusing to explain. Her BFF, Vasalisa, AKA: Lissa is Dragomir royalty, one of the few Dragomir's left. She falls in love with this dude Dimitri, yada yada yada.<br>  <br>  The next series is called Sweep, I have no idea how many books are in it, but here are the first two:<br>  Book of Shadows<br>  The Coven<br>  Written by: Cate Tiernan<br>  <br>  Basically about a girl who finds out she is a blood witch and the whole series is about that, it is really good, though.<br>  <br>  The third is the Vampire Kisses series. Here are the first two:<br>  Vampire Kisses<br>  Kissing Coffins<br>  <br>  Written by: Ellen Schreiber<br>  <br>  It is a really cute story abour a girl, Raven, who ever since she was in kindergarten wanted to be a vampire. Now 16, she is gothic, and an outcast, along with her farm BFF, Becky. Then a family, the Sterlings, move into the creepy boarded up mansion on Benson hill, and all the evidence says they are vampires. Her and Alexander Sterling fall in love and she searches to see if her is really a vampire. The ending has the biggest cliffhanger ever (I am not saying of what) and I still haven't read the second book! I am dying! The book is roughly 300 pages and I read it in a day. It is soo awesome!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Enjoy!|`|aMGfRum0aa	Dangerous Girls; R. L.

Monster?    Fear?   <br>  <br>  Etc <br>  <br>  For more interesting character styles, which i'll consider qute scary and chilling, pick up 'Heart Sick' or 'Sweet Heart' by Chelsea Cain, there is a female serial killer init very much in the style of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, her name is Gretchen Lowell.<br>  <br>  For a film reference check out the character Jack Ripiner in Wes Craven's Red Eye (he has a habit of guessing people out,which is very scary).<br>  Another is John Ryder from the Original Hitcher movie from the 1980s portrayed by rughter howard. His very silent but does say much but when he speaks you listen and it's quite scary nothing like the overglamorised remake.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a good one idea, from the top of my head.<br>  Someone with MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder).<br>  Are they a killer or not? <br>  Is there more than one killer inside him?<br>  If so how does he stop them if they are a part of him?|`|ZDyKFoinaa	Janitor with a hook for a hand offers young teenage girl a ride home, but on the way his tire blows out and he can't fix it because he only has one hand.  girl calls her mom and the person who answers says she doesn't have a daughter...it was the wrong number; highway services come and fix the flat and the janitor takes the girl home.

iJzIIEdfaa	The Persian Armies were heavily dependent on cavalry and chariotry. Mountainous regions are generally unsuitable for cavalry to operate in and impossible for chariots. <br>  <br>  This was also the reason why the Greeks never developed cavalry of any real consequence. However this also led them to develop heavy infantry that was overwhelmingly powerful (hoplite phalanxes).<br>  <br>  Every Greek victory against them made use of strategic positioning of their hoplites near hilly or mountainous areas to negate the Persian's cavalry advantage.<br>  <br>  The mountainous areas of Greece were generally situated further inland and so the Hellenic poleis were situated near either the coast (trade advantage) or the mountains (defensive advantage).|`|4e977e0718d9e088255511707db887fcaa	1.

A difference to the universe, no, not at all.  A difference to you and me?  Yes, ofcourse.  A "world" of difference.<br>  <br>  What exists if nothing existed?  Nothing, not even the thought to ponder the question.<br>  <br>  You need to realize that the universe is composed of nothing but carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and a myriad of other chemicals and gases.  Thats all, even people are composed of the same elements.<br>  <br>  With that said, you also should know that people have thoughts.<br>  There is consciousness in the universe, and it originates from within us.  How we arrived at this point with our ability to reason and discover, well, thats a mystery.

That only makes me feel like my existence is quite miniscule. I think, ironically, it is best to concentrate on your relationship to the universe as something necessary and that starts in a small way with the immediate environment. There is some sort of master plan at play and I think it will take a lifetime to try and figure it out. Until then, it is a mystery that continues. You can't get upset about your relationship to the universe, just accept that you are a necessity in the plan.|`|a0ZZnI3paa	It's none of your business|`|A01w1dHqaa	Everything is perfectly designed so we will learn to love.
N4xd99Qaaa	Probably not the best to answer since I never read the book. I remember the movie though. Have pennywise in the gutter or standing not far from the entrance of his lair. I'm sure the assignment is just to show how you visually interpret the description in the book In my days it wouldn't be too graphic at all. A little morbid maybe but coming from a Master of Horror it is meant to be. I wouldn't see a problem with that scene as long as you do not make it bloody.

Y07zLuaKaa	Oh you definitely have to start from the beginning! It's like a cardinal sin if you don't (soz majorly obsessive when it comes to the HPs!) The first 3 aren't that long and so addictive you should be through them in a week... and then the next film out is the sixth, and 4,5 and 6 are bigger so maybe give yourself a week. Total = a month. Seeing as the release date is 17th July, you have ages! Read them, you won't regret it. The films are nothing compared to the books, the only good side is the casting of Snape (Ever since the 1st film I have loved him as opposed to hating his guts). <br>  If you like Supernatural style literature, try Poison by Chris Wooding, one of my favourite ever books, definitely worth a read! x|`|uq1GXvSdaa	You have to read the books in order<br>  there 's also the Artemis Fowl books|`|y5xrKPxMaa	i don't think it would be too much of a problem but there are more complex parts to the story which the film doesn't show or doesn't say much about, so if you enjoy reading i would say begin from the first book so that you will understand it more becuase i personally think they did leave a lot of it out. However the first two books do not really have that much significance so if you really didnt want to read them all then skip the first two but they are good reads so id advise to start from the beginning =) Happy Reading!|`|M0bE2IBQaa	It would be best to start from the beginning. The books and movies are very different. The books contain much more detail. For example, The Order of the Pheonix book had many details and important facts in it that the movie left out.

If you find them a bit borning and childing try sticking with them as they do "grow up" like of course the main character a book about an eleven year old brat is quite different from a book about a seventeen year old with a death wish :)|`|bUeMqGgMaa	Don't start somewhere in the middle. You have to start at the beginning to understand Harry's misfortune, his sadness, his magic. Besides at that point alot of people have already died, so read from the first. Did you like Twilight? Well, when you read Harry Potter you will relize how amatuer Stephanie Myer really is.|`|AmWWJ0n9aa	Oh my God! You can't start it from the last film, you would be missing out on LIFE ITSELF!!! Read the whole series, as the films omitted loads of really good bits and changed bits unnecessarily as well. Oh please read it all! They're so much better than the films (AND they put Twilight to shame completely).|`|JveSbhSuaa	Definitely start from the beginning. They missed out so much that you just won't understand some of the later books. They also don't include Peeves the poltergeist in the films, and he's great.|`|jPnspD1Saa	From the first book, the movies left out a lot, and you'll be able to understand everything better.|`|5dMw30kMaa	Start from the first book for sure.

AA10303012	That is a mystery, no one knows for sure.  Those blocks are simply massive, probably weighing a few tons each,  Even with slave labor and rolling logs underneath, the task would have been nearly impossible to move even one, let alone hundreds.  Remember too that most all of those blocks had to be moved uphill (as the pyramid grew).  We will probably never know.<br>  <br>  About 20 years ago, a group of modern day engineers were employed to construct a kind of mini pyramid, maybe about 25 feet tall.  Even using their knowledge of modern techniques and principles, they had an extremely difficult time, and the finished project looked horrible, nothing like the ancient  pyramids symmetry.|`|msNXomjTaa	People have been debating this for centuries.

ceBTTCPwaa	Julius Caesar is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1599. It portrays the conspiracy against the Roman dictator of the same name, his assassination and its aftermath. It is one of several Roman plays that he wrote, based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.<br>  <br>  Although the title of the play is Julius Caesar, Caesar is not the main character in its action; he appears in only three scenes, and is killed at the beginning of the third act. The protagonist of the play is Marcus Brutus, and the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands of honor, patriotism, and friendship.<br>  <br>  The play reflected the general anxiety of England over succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Though we know Brutus loved and honored his wife Portia (as we saw in their one scene together), he won’t weep over her, as it will do no good. That’s called stoicism. Still, we know Brutus isn’t as callous as say, Macbeth because his sadness over Portia’s death seeps into his mood, leading him to pick a fight with Cassius.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Brutus/Julius Caesar
TjjPm5P1aa	That could be a number of books! Here are some I liked.<br>  <br>  To Older Teens and Adults I would recommend...<br>  <br>  The Southern vampire series by Charlaine Harris.(aka. Sookie Stackhouse series.) 9 books so far, next book releases May 2009 Includes many different supernatural beings (werewolves, Vampires, Shapeshifters, faries) . It is very good! HBO's True Blood Series is based off this series. (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  The Anita Blake- Vampire Hunter Series by Laurell Hamilton. 16 books so far I believe. If you like Southern vampires series, you will definately like this one too. Along the same lines however Anita Blake is one tough cookie! (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  Vampire Academy Series- by Richelle Mead- Vampire Academy, Frostbite, shadow kiss (next one comes out in August 2009). Very good series! Would classify this as older teens and up. Very entertaining! (main characters are 17 years old)- vampires but no werewolves...<br>  <br>  The House of Night Series- by P.C. Cast & Kristin Cast- Marked, Betrayed, Chosen, Untamed (next book comes out 3/10/09) Also a very good series. Teens and older would enjoy this. Has romance and action. Must read in order. (main character is 17 years old) again vampires but no werewolves<br>  <br>  For Young Adults, I would recommend...<br>  <br>  Night Word Series- by L.J. Smith- 3 volumes so far that have three books a piece in them. The stories are all interlinked in one way or another in the "Night World" however the same characters dont tend to repeat between the stories. The world stays the same but i think of them as all seperate books. Each book was entertaining though. Main characters are in high school. Has vampires, werewolves, witches...|`|muD7o37iaa	probably an anne rice book.<br>  <br>  seeing as most of meyer's material is based off her...|`|AA10230930	It could be Laurell K Hamilton's anita Blake books, Or Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-hunter series although they arent exactly Vampires, but something similar.|`|DF7wGWWKaa	There's Blood and Chocolate if you like werewolves.

Turns out that guy she sees everywhere, the one leaving trails of gold glitter, isn’t a figment of her imagination. He’s a pixie—and not the cute, lovable kind with wings.

How they handle peer pressure, nasty gossip, new relationships, and anonymous threats may mean life or death.

Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist.

I am on Betrayed, I think the series is awesome!<br>  <br>  The series:<br>  Marked<br>  Betrayed<br>  Chosen<br>  The last one, idk? Sorry.<br>  <br>  Written by P.C Cast and Kristen Cast<br>  <br>  It is about a girl who was Marked at her High School to become a vampyre [Yeah, that is how they spelled it, I am OCD about it] It is like a High School for Vampires. Four years, and you have to make it through the Change. Zoey is bullied by Aphrodite, the leader of the Dark Daughters, and possibly becomes a member. <br>  Meanwhile, she faces confrontation with Erik Night, read to find out what!<br>  <br>  Okay: I only have three series for you, but they are pretty awesome. <br>  <br>  The first:<br>  Vampire Academy<br>  Frostbite<br>  Shadow Kissed<br>  A series written by Richelle Mead.<br>  <br>  They are about a girl who is a dhampir, hald Moroi (Full vampire) half human. The whole relationship with these three species if kind of confusing to explain. Her BFF, Vasalisa, AKA: Lissa is Dragomir royalty, one of the few Dragomir's left. She falls in love with this dude Dimitri, yada yada yada.<br>  <br>  The next series is called Sweep, I have no idea how many books are in it, but here are the first two:<br>  Book of Shadows<br>  The Coven<br>  Written by: Cate Tiernan<br>  <br>  Basically about a girl who finds out she is a blood witch and the whole series is about that, it is really good, though.<br>  <br>  The third is the Vampire Kisses series. Here are the first two:<br>  Vampire Kisses<br>  Kissing Coffins<br>  <br>  Written by: Ellen Schreiber<br>  <br>  It is a really cute story abour a girl, Raven, who ever since she was in kindergarten wanted to be a vampire. Now 16, she is gothic, and an outcast, along with her farm BFF, Becky. Then a family, the Sterlings, move into the creepy boarded up mansion on Benson hill, and all the evidence says they are vampires. Her and Alexander Sterling fall in love and she searches to see if her is really a vampire. The ending has the biggest cliffhanger ever (I am not saying of what) and I still haven't read the second book! I am dying! The book is roughly 300 pages and I read it in a day. It is soo awesome!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

spYpsixUaa	1. There is a fly on the wall in the corner of a dark room in the upstairs attic in my mind which is pondering philosophical questions like "Why would Thales think that everything is made of water?" There is another fly on that same wall which is pondering the smell of rotting tomato sauce rising up from the floor and wondering if he should fly down to it and try to eat some of it. On the facing wall of these two flies is a spider who is pondering the tasty effort of chasing them down and eating them.<br>  <br>  2. "Work, work, work--Hello boys, I've missed you!" Perpetuating the species is neither a sensical nor nonsensical thing to do. It's the genetic purpose of living beings. Even plants do it. The purpose of procreation (i.e., the meaning of Life (Imagine Opus and Bill standing in the Meadow looking inside their underwear to examine the only thing about them that gives meaning to their lives)) is an individual effort, almost a competitive struggle. "I procreate so that my progeny can outnumber the other guy's progeny." That's what procreation is all about. Life itself and the fact that we have brains is merely something to pass the time inbetween children. Gee, that's kinda depressing. I'm glad I disagree with it.<br>  <br>  3. Godzilla doesn't have any religion. Should I be afraid of you? There is a tiny little earthworm crawling up out of the drain in my bathtub swirling around in the ceramic basin, squirming in the light with all the stinging soap-stains, and I look down at it and wonder, "What is the point of your life? You're not Godzilla. I'm not afraid of you! You're nothing but a little worm!" Contradiction: No Religion, but "life is so godless." Oh, I get it. You're a paradox!<br>  <br>  4. If you can say "Cogito ergo Sum," a predatory carnivore will be tempted to eat you!<br>  <br>  5. Yet another in the continuing struggle of the 42-ish quandary of conundrums! Is it time for yet another visit to Amazon.com for yet another mail-order copy of that amazing technological invention (The Electronic Book-like device which has a huge yellow smiley face on it that calmly advises each reader, "Don't Panic!"? Yes, the supposedly science-fiction notion of a paperless book in a portable electronic format is in fact a reality now. Does this constitute an existential crisis for Reality? What happens when the realm of science fiction becomes real objects readily available on the market? When Sci-Fi becomes reality? Am I going to be walking down the hall at work Monday to meet William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy arguing about philosophy with those delightfully quizzical looks on their faces? Yes, Go To Amazon.com. Buy an electronic copy of The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The answers that you seek will be found there.<br>  <br>  6. Yeah, but there's free coffee in the Office Kitchen. And they give you this nifty badge with the company logo and your picture on it . . . .Oh, that's not the point, is it? Duh! It's a test! He puts us on the planet with a book of instructions, and the test is to see if we can figure out how to live according to the instructions in that book before we die. Haven't you ever seen Beetlejuice? It's the same thing, except we're not dead! Have some more coffee. Oh, and look. They gave me this cool mousepad with the Corporate philosophy printed on it!<br>  <br>  7. The dogs roam the streets in a cantankerous herd, packing like gerbils and swarming like birds, bellowing like vain breezes in trees, a soundless howl against the icy winds of Winter in a midwestern cornfield, waiting for the imagined horror that they call "He who walks between the Rows," and looking for strange lights in the skies (while we enjoy a peaceful reverie noticing the shape of Orion's bow and arrow), and yet we toil in the soil mining for gold as we age mercilessly wailing at the waning of our lives.<br>  <br>  8. We exist because we are here, and our sense of duty is determined by society. In an existentialist view, our meaning / purpose / value in Life is merely living it. Sometimes people recite the blind optimism that Life is a gift that should be cherished, but when you go to bed alone and stare at the ceiling, you get pretty saddened when you have to disagree and say that "It just is." Sometimes people spout the famous aphorisms, unhelpfully, "Go where you're most needed when you're most needed." and "Help others, join a charity, etc." Others will spew contempt at you for posting a question which could conceivably be searched in the Y!A Indexes (The White space in the Green bar just below the Banner sign on the screen), but sometimes the point of posting the question yourself is the magic of having somebody talking directly to you.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	You are who you want to be.<br>  You are here to do what you choose.<br>  Your life will mean whatever you want it to be.|`|I0TOw1KSaa	You are a human.  <br>  <br>  As a  human, you are an individual part of the machine called the human race.

He laid huge areas waste by his agricultural experiments. he set his country back in industrial development by at least half a century.|`|By2mEY6Waa	one bad thing was he inspired communism as the leader of the communist revolt|`|lPxVt2XYaa	Lenin was undoubtedly a positive influence on Russia.  Russia under the Tsars was a medieval, peasant dominated mess of a country.  The aristocracy was fabulously wealthy, and the poor were living in primitive squalor, millions were still serfs, as they could not afford to pay for their freedom. <br>  Lenin did institute the Red Terror - but it only lasted 6 weeks, and did not kill millions - tens of thousands at most (that is bad enough - I don't understand why people feel the need to exaggerate the figures).<br>  Lenin's initial economic programme was disastrous, War Communism was basically the stealing of grain and foodstuffs from the peasants - and it was carried out with violence.  But, in 1921, he began the New Economic Policy.  A policy designed to kickstart the economy.  It allowed peasants to own their own land, to sell any surplus on the free market, it allowed small businesses to operate, but it did keep the banks and large industry in state hands.<br>  Politically, people were no less free under Lenin that they were under the Tsars, political parties were banned under both, there was greater freedom of the press and free expression under Lenin - censorship was actually relaxed after the Revolution.<br>  Socially, again, people were freer after the Revolution.  They were able to associate with others without interference from the secret police (a freedom that did not last), women were allowed to have abortions, to vote, to hold office, to have jobs and careers, to attend university and to initiate divorce.  Literacy reached 70% under Lenin - a far cry from the 5% under the Tsars.<br>  Lenin's rule also saw electrification for much of the country, and the beginnings of a comprehensive telephone network.  <br>  Lenin's greatest achievement was to turn a basket-case country into a (more) modern economy, able to compete with the World economy.<br>  Granted many of the freedoms did not last, and if you were an aristocrat then you would view things differently, and, of course, Stalin's legacy overshadows Lenin, but the Revolution was an enormous leap forward for Russia, to argue otherwise is to demonstrate that you know little of Russia under the previous tyrants.<br>  See:<br>  Russia, People & Empire 1552 - 1917 - Geoffrey Hoskings<br>  Russia, A History - Geoffrey Freeze<br>   History of the National Economy of Russia to the 1917 Revolution - P Lyashchenko

fcf8a9da7cd0ed8382f55b3b1bc00293aa	W. Mayers is correct, and I would also add that Sherman, being on the Union side, was also on the side of the victor. Since the union won the war, it would have been highly unlikely that they would have been willing to entertain the idea of classifying his actions as war crimes. Modern day examples: Soldiers and private contractors in Iraq are not subject to the local laws of Iraq and thus cannot be held liable for their actions other than by U.S. military justice  That is typically the case for occupying nations.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	There were no commonly-agreed standards that defined "war crime" at that time.  General Sherman knew his tactics were harsh.  In his own words "War is cruel. It is terrible.  There's no use trying to reform it.  The more terrible it is, the sooner it will be over!"<br>  The General was not a warmonger, but he was a realist.

The publishing industry is in big trouble right now, just like all those other industries we hear about on TV every night during the evening news…only no one is bailing the publishing industry out.<br>  <br>  So publishers are having to lay people off, shut down whole divisions, and cancel book contracts. Projects some of us have been working on are being “post-poned indefinitely.” One of my best friends just got laid off from her job last week. And of course, bookstores all over the country are having to shut down due to flagging sales.<br>  <br>  This is just wrong."

If the writer can come up with a thesis, or elements of the book he/she feels are worth writing about, then it's valid. It could be something as complicated as comparing the different manifestations of Transcendentalism in Thoreau and Emerson's essays, or something as common as discussing the allegorical nature of the names in Harry Potter. You could even write an entire essay on the different types of Pokemons in my daughter's Pokemon handbook if you had something to say about it!

AA11114869	I agree with your take on this matter...<br>  <br>  Barring the semantics over whether or not voting is a 'right' or a 'privilege', it is illogical to presume that one who has been given a privilege should be compelled to use it; one is not forced to drive a car simply because one has earned their driver's license.<br>  <br>  If our most recent elections have proved anything, - it's that sometimes one may feel that no party or candidate is worth the energy it would take vote for them.<br>  <br>  In the U.S., the 'non-voting' block of voter-citizens has been growing steadily and, though some believe this trend to be harmful to our election process, I believe more damage is done to the process by those who vote just for the sake of voting; choosing a lesser-of-evils simply because they can.  These misguided 'must-voters' will often state that if you don't vote, then you've no grounds for complaining about the outcome of an election; given that voting is not compulsory, this argument is sophomorically facile. <br>  <br>  As I see it, the larger the 'non-voting' block gets, -  the more attention it will draw from future candidates who would seek to tap into that those potential votes.  To accomplish this, these candidates will have to develop political platforms which challenge the current political ideologies, - ideologies which have revealed themselves to be, at best, unoriginal and, at worst, obsolete.<br>  <br>  In this, non-voters do not intentionally harm our political process at all; they are simply the antigens which stimulate the immune system of our democracy,... and it is painfully evident to me that our sickly democracy is in desperate need of an immune boost.<br>  -|`|esLsR6keaa	One reason to vote is to have a basis for a later complaint, or praise.  Say, for instance, you voted for Obama.  Suppose Obama was able to turn this country around.  You were a small part of making this happen, which you could take credit for.  On the other hand, if you didn't vote, and an elected official ran the country into the ground, you don't have any right to complain, because you did not vote for somebody else.

8MaRk2AZaa	The plot of Murphy follows an eponymous "seedy solipsist" who, urged to find a job by his lover Celia Kelly, begins work as a male nurse at the Magdalen Mental Mercyseat, and finds the insanity of the patients an appealing alternative to conscious existence.<br>  <br>  Murphy is an example of Beckett's fascination with the artistic and metaphorical possibilities of chess. Near the novel's end, Murphy plays a game of chess with Mr. Endon, a patient who is "the most biddable little gaga in the entire institution". But Murphy cannot replicate his opponent's symmetrical and cyclical play, just as he is unable to will himself into a state of catatonic bliss. He resigns "with fool's mate in his soul", and dies shortly afterwards. Beckett relates the game in full English notation, complete with a comically arch commentary.<br>  <br>  Moving between Ireland and England, the novel is caustically satirical at the expense of the Irish Free State, which had recently banned Beckett's More Pricks Than Kicks: the astrologer consulted by Murphy is famous 'throughout civilised world and Irish Free State'; 'for an Irish girl' Murphy's admirer Miss Counihan was 'quite exceptionally anthropoid'; and in the General Post Office, site of the 1916 Rising, Neary assaults the buttocks of Oliver Sheppard's statue of mythic Irish hero Cúchulainn (the statue in fact possesses no buttocks). The novel also contains a scabrous portrait of poet Austin Clarke as the dipsomaniac Austin Ticklepenny, given to unreciprocated 'manstruprations' of Murphy under the table; against Oliver St. John Gogarty's advice, Clarke declined to sue.<br>  <br>  Murphy indeed cannot go insane to achieve freedom. What he turns to instead is nothingness, and his ashes are properly spread amidst the grime of a bar. Celia also discovers the beauty of nothingness, as she loses her love, Murphy, and her grandfather's health declines. Beckett seamlessly converts comedy to terror of non-existence, as he does in his later work, Waiting for Godot.<br>  <br>  Among the many thinkers to influence Murphy's mind-body debate are Spinoza, Descartes, and the little-known Belgian Occasionalist Arnold Geulincx.

n7rfbfGmaa	Right, save yourself and don't read twilight. lol.<br>  How ever, you may enjoy books by Tim Bowler and Melvin Burgess.<br>  The only book I've read by Tim Bowler is Frozen Fire, which is pretty good. <br>  <br>  Frozen Fire- Tim Bowler<br>  It starts with the phone call, late at night. The mysterious boy says he is dying. Dusty doesn't want to get involved - but the boy seems to have a link to the one person who's most important to her. Soon she has been drawn in - and now she has to deal with the other people who are looking for the boy - the violent man and his two sons, and the police too ...Yet throughout all this, Dusty senses the presence of a boy who is not dying, a strange elusive boy who can show her what happened to her missing brother and solve the greatest mystery of her life. Where he is, who he is, why he wants to die, she cannot say. Only one thing is certain. Finding him will be dangerous.<br>  <br>  Junk- Melvin Burgess<br>  <br>  This is an uncompromising, compelling and true-to-life story of two teenagers drawn into the dangerous and destructive world of heroin addiction. This tour de force by an acclaimed and provocative writer should become a definitive teenage novel on this subject.<br>  <br>  You may enjoy books by Meg Rosoff...<br>  Just In Case- Meg Rosoff<br>  <br>  What if Fate were out to get you? The day David Case saves his brother's life, his whole world changes. He must hide, become an entirely new person to escape Fate...if he can. This stunning, thought-provoking and darkly comic novel for teenage readers was one of the most eagerly awaited books of 2006<br>  <br>  THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ IS....The Hunger Games By Suzanne Collins. Read it. Its AMAZING!<br>  The Hunger Games- Suzanne Collins<br>  <br>  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. But Katniss has been close to death before - and survival, for her, is second nature. "The Hunger Games" is a searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present. Welcome to the deadliest reality TV show ever.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I help :D|`|uvn609hsaa	TWILIGHT<br>  <br>  If you like fiction anyway.

I have no specific favourite book but I have lots of favourite ones. But trust me don't read Twilight, that's advice from a bookworm.<br>  <br>  You should read: (..) mean how many there are in the series.<br>  <br>  *Noughts & Crosses series by Malorie Blackman (5) - Prejudice, love, murder, explosion, a fantastic plot and basically this book is a must read! You have to read it. Whether you're a boy or girl. It's a sad book as well so expect to cry (if 15 year old boys cry!).<br>  *Darren Shan Saga by Darren Shan (12/13)- boys simply love this I think, it's horror and all, a very cool story, you won't be disappointed... that is if you can stand horror!<br>  *Demonata series by Darren Shan (10, but only 8 are out so far)- these are horror ones as well and worse than the Darren Shan Saga, it's gruesome lol.<br>  *The Declaration (2) - this really got me hooked like 1,2,3! I was reading this instead of doing my biology work a few weeks ago, I must say it's my fav book of this year.<br>  *Eragon by Christopher Paolini (4, but only 3 are out so far) - dragons, an adventure, it reminds me of Lord of the Rings.<br>  *Candy by Kevin Brooks - this one is about a romance (boy's point of view) and is an awesome thriller.<br>  *Black Rabbit Summer by Kevin Brooks - another thriller.<br>  *Hacker by Malorie Blackman - this one is well smart!<br>  *Do the Creepy Thing by Graham Joyce - this is pretty creepy!<br>  *TWOC by Graham Joyce - can't remember really but it was cool!|`|ZNrWBxEBaa	Have you tried the Cherub series by Robert Muchamore.

AA10248239	A good warmup is to write quotes from a play on little pieces of paper, and give one to each member of the group as s/he enters the room.  Dim the lights, light a candle, and have them read the quotes to each other as they mill around in the gloom.  ("It must be by his death.")<br>  <br>  A good activity is to have each student choose a character and act like that character all day.  Students then guess who the others were mimicing.<br>  <br>  Have students research food in the time and place where the play is set. Each brings a typical dish to the meeting, and they share them, pot-luck style, at the end.<br>  <br>  A recitation competition is a lot of fun. Each student memorizes a passage of about twenty lines and then acts it out for the group.<br>  <br>  One of the best activities is a press conference.  One student takes the role of a major character, and the others ask him journalist-type questions.  <br>  <br>  A formal debate between two of the main characters is also fun.<br>  <br>  All of these activities require advanced preparation, but they are really worth it!|`|WgORak7saa	We did a short reenactment from the book wearing costumes and stuff. we also made a short film we got a a with  plus yeaaa!!!!|`|yVsuERSFaa	make fun of them

I tend to read books over and over, and it's always a thrill to me every time I catch something I missed before. Some books that have done that for me are :The harry potter series, Hamlet, Howl's moving castle, Lady Chatterly's Lover, and there's much more!<br>  I'm not sure entirely why this happens with me, I think it has partly to do with the depth of the book I'm reading, and also how I myself read it. If I barrel through the book for the story, I tend to skip small details, and when I read it a 5th time, or 8th, the smaller, finer points become more clear. A small allusion I missed the first time, a tiny theme that seemed so insignificant the 1st time. It's something I particularly enjoy about reading.|`|D6RekU7Iaa	Ender's Game (and its sequels) by Orson Scott Card<br>  <br>  Wicked (and its sequels) by Gregory Maquire<br>  <br>  Harry Potter, by J.K.

I hope this helps, and happy reading!!|`|B1LkXUKvaa	Uglies, pretties, specials, extras,<br>  the midnighters series,<br>  and harry potter.<br>  any other good book as well. i think it is because you are so caught into the story, that you miss a few details, and your eyes skip over things, and then when you go back, you start to slow down and catch more.|`|BfZnkS6Baa	TWILIGHT SAGA COLLECTION cuz EDWARD CULLEN is in it!

ahjqc9Ifaa	You don't tell the director or set designer how to do his job. You put in only what must be there for the story to work.<br>  <br>  You might set your scene:<br>  EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY or EXT. QUIET APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT<br>  <br>  The writing style is lean, lean, lean. Action lines, which include all description, cannot be more than four lines and can include only what has to be there, not how you, the screenwriter, envision things.<br>  <br>  An action line from Grosse Point Blank:<br>  Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down....<br>  <br>  Nothing about how he's dressed, what he's carrying, his facial expression--those are not the writer's decisions. In a spec script, even the detail about the gum would be too much.<br>  <br>  From The Godfather:<br>  At least five hundred guests fill the main courtyard and gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine.<br>  <br>  Nothing about the kinds of foods, the weather, how the guests look--because none of that is essential for the story to proceed.<br>  <br>  Read 20 good screenplays and nearly all your beginners questions will be answered without you having to ask them.|`|ikMOb6gcaa	MB above me has nailed it . . .

It is reaching more people and the message that is often contained in these books is more widely disseminated.<br>  <br>  Do you consider that a book you buy from a second hand shop or jumble sale de values the work because you are not paying the cover price? I would guess not.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about a monetary value in a book then do not worry. Unless you have first copies or early versions generally 'classics' have little or no monetary value and any value in those books is not affected by the re issue of titles under different cover.|`|02JUswskaa	I don't wish to appear pretentious or arrogant, but I'm afraid you are misguided. <br>  <br>  What do you consider is the role of art?<br>  <br>  Art is the medium by which we attempt to understand ourselves. It is a testament of the human condition.<br>  <br>  And in a perfect world all great artists would be paid so that their works could be given away free or able to be viewed for free. <br>  <br>  Great art of all kinds belongs in the public domain. That's primarily why it's been created. <br>  <br>  Maybe the newspaper is devaluing the work; but that is of of no importance. <br>  <br>  Judging Hardy's great work by how much money it can raise is plain wrong, and such an attitude is no better than the newspaper's you decry.<br>  <br>  Rejoice that it is free. Hardy would.|`|B1LkXUKvaa	well, no i am not shocked.the worlds corrupt, and we have to live with it. but it helps them sell, and it proves how much people like classics, in a way. it also encourages people to read the classics. i know classics are brilliant, but you need a dictionary to read them! i am a very avid reader, and read the harry potter series in 4 or 5 days in the summer when i was in third grade, and the twilight series in a week, and it took me a week to finish 20 pages. they can give u a major headache. most people wouldn't bother, so this is a blessing as well as curse, if u get what i'm saying.|`|VtRM7YEFaa	this makes me angry because im a lover of literature.

They're giving away really great books to encourage their customers to read more, and to entice people who already enjoy classics to give their newspaper a try.|`|uzIiaT4oaa	Im not sure what youre upset about. Explain.<br>  Settle down. Literatue is literature. You can like it or you can loathe it. One mans classic is another mans cartoon. But hating the fact that literature(crap or otherwise) is being handed out to the great unwashed is a bad thing is surely wrong. If you feel that some books are so superior and such classics that they shouldnt be handed out for free then you should burn all public librarys immediately because thats what they do. They allow literature available to anyone who wants it. Snobbery is a class thing and it marks you.|`|BzMQejGxaa	It's a very good idea.

A Great and Terrible Beauty<br>  2. Rebel Angels<br>  3. The Sweet Far Thing<br>  <br>  There's lots of kind of "forbidden" romance in this, like the romance the main character Gemma has with her love interest is really complicated and unconventional, and it has lots of "unreleased" sexual tension...If you liked Twilight then you'll definitely like the romance that's in this book. <br>  <br>  Also the plot revovles around the development of Gemma's magical abilities...she's able to have these visions that eventually leads her into a totally different world...It's very supernaturally based, and honestly this series has one of the best plots I've ever read.<br>  <br>  You can probably google some quick reviews and plot summaries but if you liked the Twilight saga then you will DEFINITELY like this series. Actually I liked this series more than Twilight...I couldn't even put it down. I stayed up all night once to finish the first one (Great and Terrible Beauty) because it was just so so so good...It's very well written. The author, Libba Bray, writes better than Stephenie Meyer in my opinion, and you'll be able to relate to the characters in this for sure. All in all it was a really good series. I was so sad to finish it. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend it!<br>  <br>  Good luck =)

32g69LSZaa	They're all amazing books, I recommend reading them all in time. <br>  <br>  I think Fahrenheit 451 is the one you should read first, because it's really not too troublesome a read. The content is straightforward for the most part. <br>  <br>  A Clockwork Orange is AMAZING but the language may be a little difficult at first. Don't be discouraged by it though, it's a very good book. <br>  <br>  Albert Camus is a brilliant writer, and The Stranger is lovely. It's not too long, not too difficult, but hard to understand if you go into it not realizing it's supposed to absurd and existential.<br>  <br>  Catch 22 I also love dearly. Brave New World is the only one I don't keep around religiously, but is still a classic.|`|NENNHNVPaa	In order of personal preference:<br>  <br>  Brave New World<br>  Catch 22<br>  Fahrenheit 451<br>  A Clockwork Orange<br>  The Stranger    (this one is last only because I have not read it.)<br>  <br>  All are good choices though.

It focuses on Maximum Ride (Max), the leader of the 'flock', and the narrator of the story.<br>  <br>  Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer<br>  Artemis Fowl is a series of fantasy novels written by Irish author Eoin Colfer, starring the teenage criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II. The series is written in half-serious language, alternating dark moments with humorous ones, a style favored by a number of popular children's authors.<br>  <br>  Artemis, the main character, is a ruthless and extremely intelligent young criminal whose main goal is the acquisition of money through a variety of often-illegal schemes (although his values change towards the fifth book). The author summed up the series as: "Die Hard with fairies."[<br>  <br>  First shot by Walter Sorrells<br>  Two things that Dave is certain of are that his mom was killed two years ago and that his dad does not seem to care. He never suspects that his dad could have killed her until he follows his dad one dark stormy night and watches as his father buries something that looks suspiciously like a rifle. Dave is still reluctant to admit to anyone that his father killed his mother, and it is not until next spring that Dave finally admits to the police in his hometown what he saw that night. The story, told through Dave’s first person account, twists and turns and spans several months and the events reveal lies and cover-ups of families that attended the private school that Dave’s father is headmaster at. Over the course of the novel, Dave is able to prove his father’s innocence and even manages to create a closer relationship with his father. While the story itself is intriguing, the novel ends without conclusively proving who kills Dave’s mother, which can leave the reader feeling a bit disappointed, but the colorful cast of characters make the novel an intriguing read nonetheless.

Its about 4 girls living in Los Angeles. They are goddesses with supernatural powers. Invisibility, time-travel, premonitions and mind reading. They have to protect the world from an ancient evil called the Atrox.

There’s murder, betrayal, loss and all of the usual tragic elements; there aren’t really even many funny parts; and there’s absolutely no sex.

The eeriness starts occurring when Emily and her friend Marianne visit a hispanic fortune teller boy named Lupe who tells Emily that her husband is cheating on her and promises to take care of the problem if she engages in a certain practice with him (you get my drift). <br>  <br>  Anyway, she eventually discovers the adultery and begins to become obsessed by the boy, doing what he says in order to obtain what he needs from the husband's lover. After a graphic and disturbing scene, the deal is made and the lover is found dead sitting in a chair, her body burned beyond recognition. A further complication, the boy purportedly "advising" Emily Blake has been dead for weeks... <br>  <br>  Emily is then arrested for murder by supernatural means and personally tried by the ambitious DA who sees this case as advancing his career. Emily is represented by a retired lawyer/friend of the family who has a fear that Emily is not exhausted or eccentric like her family and friends believe, but that there may be some thing to the supernatural element. Another thing, Emily discovers that she is pregnant during her trial."|`|32g69LSZaa	It's Lupe...it's also out of print. Very nice book.

She only agreed to wear the beautiful, unusual ruby earrings that were tied to those tales to please the older woman. Then, a man steps out of the myths and carries her away to Ixtumea where Lupe is supposed to save both that world and this one from the Destroyer. In doing so, she will have to learn new things and face much opposition, including that of her own mother who may be willing to sacrifice her to appease the darkness.

iNXqiDIYaa	[edit] Jeremiah Mortimer<br>  He was Brett's boyfriend in the beginning of the school year but as time flew by, he was dumped by Brett over a voice mail after discovering Brett was into Eric Dalton. His heart was crushed but rescued by a St. Lucius classmate of his, Elizabeth, who had lost her virginty with Jeremiah. His secret was exposed in a game of I Never, and told Brett that it was her fault this happened. Jeremiah sent Brett text messages and e-mails to her saying he and her should talk but, Brett ignored them. He returns in the 5th volume in Lucky with a message saying if she was alright in the barn fire and to see if a certain rumor was true. He soon found the hurtful truth: not only Brett was seeing someone else but, Kara who was called Girlfriend by Benny with Lon, but she was a lesbian now. But what he doesn't know, is that Brett truly loves him after breaking up with Kara and being friends.

You can pause animated gifs and then step them forwards one frame at  time in Media Player. I just tried with your file.<br>  <br>  Now you just need screen capture software. You could use the old Windows Print Screen method to capture the screen to the clipboard and then paste it into a document in an image editing program, or use proper screen capture software to select a specific area of the screen for capture (this will automatically save the captured file to a folder for you too). There are tons of freeware and shareware screen cap applications out there.

Is the poem telling us that while you want a dream world you don't believe you can find it?  Or will it end by your telling us that this new adventure is going to open doors for you.

RtkB46peaa	For some reason, people get confused by the term Photoshop.  Photoshop is a piece of software.  If you own it, here is a tutorial on how to change eye color.  Basically, you select the eye, feather the selection so your color change isn't obvious, desaturate the eyes (take the color away so they're black/white), then resaturate with a new color.  It's not terribly difficult if you have a nice photo in high resolution.  If you don't have photoshop, feel free to email me a high quality photo and a choice of eye color.   ourotheremailaccount@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Here's the tutorial:<a href="http://www.photoshoptalent.com/photoshop-tutorials/change-eye-color-part1.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoshoptalent.com/photoshop...</a>|`|R3UVYaHtaa	select the eyes... recolor them, that's all duck|`|GzHCK9TJaa	photoshop itt

sEEQ9xrbaa	I had to do like the exact same thing. take a historical event and dumb it down to a children's book. I did mine on the trail of tears. All that I did was to go online and find a whole bunch of cartoon pictures of smurfs dressed up like indians. I used those as my pictures and for the sentences, i just took one sentence at a time, read it out loud a few times, and then word by word "translated" it by saying the same idea in a kids point-of-view. for example: All of the natives were immediately forced to leave their homes nd go out west to the reservations.  new sentence: The Smurfians (that's the word i used instead of indians since they were  smurfs) were told to leave and go to a new place were they could live.<br>  <br>  I hope I could help you with your project. <br>  Good luck :)|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	I suggest going to your local book store or library and looking around the children's section for ideas.

Mig6O93Naa	It is a kind of make up that comes in a tube and is applied in a thin coat using your fingers dipped in water to make it thin.  It provides a base for your make up just as pancake does, but grease paint is very messy and must be removed with cold cream as it is not water soluble.

vmmMqhxXaa	The same way anyone communes with nature.  "The voices" aren't actual sounds emitting from an actual throat articulated by an actual tongue.  They're sounds of the heart.<br>  <br>  Also, there are different theories of reincarnation.  One is that the soul can be reborn in different human lives.  Another -- and this is Siddhartha's -- is that the soul inhabits all living things (or nonliving?  rocks?  maybe).  In that case, the river could certainly "speak" to Siddhartha.<br>  <br>  After you finish this book, you might want to read one called "Black Robe," by Brian Moore.  It's about a Jesuit mission to the Algonquin Indians in the 1700's.  The Indian characters deride the Frenchmen as ignorant, because they cannot hear the forest speak.|`|ceBTTCPwaa	Siddhartha is an allegorical novel by Hermann Hesse which deals with the spiritual journey of an Indian boy called Siddhartha during the time of the Buddha.<br>  The book, Hesse's ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple yet powerful and lyrical style. It was first published in 1922, after Hesse had spent some time in India in the 1910s. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became influential during the 1960s.<br>  The word Siddhartha is made up of two words in the Sanskrit language, siddha (gotten) + artha (meaning or wealth). The two words together mean "one who has found meaning (of existence)" or "he who has attained his goals". The Buddha's name, before his renunciation, was Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Buddha. In this book, the Buddha is referred to as "Gotama".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Siddhartha_%28novel%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Siddhartha_%28no...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sid/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sid/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/siddhartha/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/siddhartha...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/Siddhartha/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/Siddhartha/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmSiddhartha02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/siddhartha" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/siddhartha.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>

Sit on the floor and close your legs and reach for your toes as well and stretch do not bounce you can hurt yourself by bouncing your muscles.  sit in butterfly style and open sidewards and push down until your knees touch the floor and finally stand in first position hold on to something like it was a ballet bar sidewards,  lift up your let that is not against the bar grab your foot  or as low as you can and lift and hold as much as you can and then the other several times soon you will have lots of flexibility|`|KjiTQZzjaa	ok im a cheerleader so what i do are 25 high kicks on each leg tell me if it works! my e-mail is kennatylr@yahoo.com

9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	We have no control over being concieved and born in the first place.  If you ask me, any argument for free will being a major factor in life is hurt by the fact that we never chose to start living.  By our parent's actions, our own life is thrust upon us.  By the time we've developed the intellectual capacity for existential thought, we've already been molded and grown attached to people and our environment.  So by the time free will can rationally be considered to come into play, it's too late for it to have any significant meaning.  Fate, destiny, causation, determinism, what have you seems to be the overriding rule.  And any sort of freedom is negligible at best.|`|bOTCVCOHaa	I agree with the assertion that we probably have no control over when we die because the Bible says that God knows the number of our days even before we're born.  But I really do think we have control over who we allow ourselves to fall in love with.  If you meet someone whom you know would be trouble, don't allow yourself to become involved with them so you won't "fall in love". <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 says there's a time for everything under Heaven.  There's a time to be born and a time to die,  a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.  So, I guess you could call it fate that all these things will happen at some point.  But I'd rather believe that God is in control of our "fate".|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Man has free will and is in full charge of his destiny , life , and death.<br>  <br>  The moral will creatures of the evolutionary worlds are always bothered with the unthinking question as to why the all-wise Creators permit evil and sin. They fail to comprehend that both are inevitable if the creature is to be truly free. The free will of evolving man or exquisite angel is not a mere philosophic concept, a symbolic ideal. Man's ability to choose good or evil is a universe reality. This liberty to choose for oneself is an endowment of the Supreme Rulers, and they will not permit any being or group of beings to deprive a single personality in the wide universe of this divinely bestowed liberty--not even to satisfy such misguided and ignorant beings in the enjoyment of this misnamed personal liberty.

NuZjVW6vaa	I love her books I have read<br>   <br>  Which Witch (my favourite)<br>  Not just a witch<br>  Dial A Ghost<br>  <br>  I haven't heard of the ones you mentioned, but I would definitely read anything by Eva Ibbotson.|`|FNwYzjogaa	Her books are wonderful. I especially love her children's books. They are phenomenal. I highly recommend anything written by Eva Ibbotson.|`|fWq4GcnSaa	Personally, I think everything by Eva Ibbotson is amazing. You should even try reading her books for kids, because they're just so well-written. I still reread her books for younger kids : )  I love "Island of the Aunts," "Journey to the River Sea," "The Secret of Platform 13," "Which Witch," and "The Haunting of Granite Falls." They have won numerous awards (Smarties, etc) and are definitely worth reading in addition to her adult novels. Any library will have them.<br>  <br>  Happy reading  : )
mnOjqnLJaa	It really depends on what kind of attitude/personality you want the picture to have. Like Hayley said, if you want a more realistic looking one, Wolf's Rain style is a great idea. Wolf's Rain wolves also would probably be better for a serious feeling picture. If you want something more fun or light-hearted, a more Pokemon style might be better. <br>  <br>  Though I have to say, Wolf's Rain would probably be the best, especially if you tend to draw realistically anyway.|`|opjYENGGaa	I draw canines as well. :)) and have a dA account.<br>  <br>  You could try to draw a wolf like the popular anime Wolf's Rain. Many anime wolves are drawn like that.<br>  <br>  Search for Wolf's Rain on Google images.|`|l2h19MS2aa	what's wrong with being realistic in your anime style?<br>  <br>  I know this might sound incoherent or stupid, but I know a manga called vagabond, and he draw a wolf realistically (well at least it look realistic to me)<br>  <br>  I don't know how to post a picture, but if you're ever interested in what I mean, you can search vagabond volume 7, page 13. Good luck!
aqeWwA71aa	Well - that is what happens when Romans lost the Republic and quit being a nation of laws.  Then horrible things happen.  The Gladiator movie itself probably is not historical, but the sense of the movie probably is.  <br>  <br>  The abuses of people under the emperors was just unbelievable - and killing a whole family went on all the time.  <br>  <br>  In the movie the main general guy - Russel Crow - threatened the emperor because he was such a good guy.  Marcus, the old emperor, favored the Russel Crow character.  So I'm sure you could get killed easily for something like that.  And then yes - Romans would send a group to kill his family probably.  <br>  <br>  Read through a fun history of Rome - like Will Durant's "Caesar and Christ".  You read that one with your mouth hanging open.  The old Romans were the most abusive people imaginable.  <br>  <br>  Actually when the 'barbarians' took over Rome finally, they were horrified by how abusive the Romans were.  It was the 'barbarians' who put a stop to the bloody "games" in the arena.|`|qgs155HNaa	The cruelty of the Roman Emperors did not extend to the wives and children of their predecessor or would-be successor.

qubLyvcRaa	That's a good question!  "Because" is a pretty good answer, but your question is universal in nature.  Consequently, the answer is universal.  The question "why?" can be applied to so many things and as such, forms the basis of man's need to find the truth in almost every aspect of our existence.  The question "why?" spans the ridiculous to the sublime.  Bill Cosby asked, "Why is there air?" and his answer was "To blow up basketballs."  Einstein answered the questions as to "why?" E=mc(squared).  The question "why?" is the basis for all the advances in science, medicine, and social order that man has made since the very beginning.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Because we have no choice in the matter; life has been preordained and we do not get to change or make the rules.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	becuase..........!!!!!<br>  <br>  because!|`|VgfUAleGaa	yes.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Ex.|`|YmtNel5haa	All men should strive<br>  to learn before they die<br>  what they are running from, and to, and why.<br>  ~James Thurber

8asG4WCwaa	First of all, you could live on the moon and still get a publisher.  Phones, faxes, and email make it possible to have an agent or publisher anywhere.  Many authors have never met their agents/editors face-to-face.  <br>  <br>  Second, you and your parents need to learn as much as you can about the publishing industry.  The novice writer is often the target or victim of scams.  You need to know the difference between traditional and self publishing (and what a vanity press is).  You need to know the difference between publishing rights and copyrights.  <br>  <br>  Third, do you need a publisher?  Have you written a book?  Is it nonfiction or a novel?  What is the genre?  What is the word count (the absolute minimum word count for a novel is 40,000, but some genres require twice that to consider publishing it)?  Is it edited and in manuscript format?  Do you need an agent?  Do you know what an agent does? Do you know how to write  a query letter and synopsis?  <br>  <br>  Writing the book is only half the process to getting published.  <br>  <br>  You can learn a lot from the many sub-forums  at absolutewrite.com/forum (the watercooler).|`|qAJZlOmNaa	Take a look at Outskirts Press.

STOP pampering yourself with many entertainments, since it'll last very short while -before it makes you feel more empty at the end that makes you want more and more and never enough till you fall out of the side effects.  or maybe you can try some light fun like games or personality quiz. or recreational; feed the cats, feed the fishes, water the plants. or skills enhancement; cooking, cleaning, or if you're not into baby care yet, you can at least play with them coz they're so cute (yes i'd suggest this to guys too, since this is about skills). what rocks life is fitness, which you gain from reasonable exercises and pains. the more you pamper, the more it isn't enough -that's what makes you feel more bored at the end.|`|wU2mikwMaa	get the best boyfriend ever.... or lyk u and ur friends can go sumwhere one night, dont make any plans.... and just go 2 the most random places. or u can go to the closest big city by you and explore, shop, eat at an exotic restaurant. just do things that...arent u. be spontaneous and wild.|`|RGJ4N1lTaa	I have the same problem and I'm 15 too!

You're still a kid; almost an adult.  You say you don't have many friends...do you know why that is?  Do you "put yourself out there" where other kids can meet and relate to you?  If you're trying to live your life without the contact of other people in your age group, you're spinning your wheels.  These things that you do...movies, eating out, taking walks...it sounds as if you're alone for these activities.  Rather than coming home from school and getting on the computer, why not see if there are any social outlets at school you can avail yourself of (yeah, I know...I ended a sentence with a preposition).  Sports?  Clubs?  It's not unusual to be bored at your age, but you have to at least make the effort.  Excitement usually doesn't just drop into your lap.  The good news is that you seem active enough where, with just a little effort and investigation, you could turn this situation around.  Finally, you have to realize that there are times that life is just BORING!  It's how you adjust that makes the difference.  Good luck and I wish you well.<br>  <br>  I just saw the addtional info you added.  In another year (good lord willing anf the creeks don't rise) you'll probably be able to drive (please leave the cell phone in your purse!).  This will give you an element of freedom that's currently missing in your life.  Just be patient.  By the way I hate the cold, love beaches (old, old surfer), so I can relate.  Again, hang in there and good luck.

You have to do this without any inhibitions about thinking you will look dumb or anything. You just allow it to happen because you are the character in that situation.

RzbRRUOdaa	If you are looking for the different steps or guiding principles in getting a book published, visit this site:<br>  <a href="http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.  Good luck to your publishing journey.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.<br>  <br>  Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com</a> to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.<br>  <br>  There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.<br>  <br>  At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com).</a> Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.<br>  <br>  If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose). Also, the marketing of your book is up to you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UaCqYFKnaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their book’s top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www2.xlibris.com/requestkit/index.asp?src=aop&key=qak" rel="nofollow">http://www2.xlibris.com/requestkit/index...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://editorinchic.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/how-to-self-publish-an-overview/" rel="nofollow">http://editorinchic.wordpress.com/2008/1...</a>|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	It's a long, complicated process that would take forever ot tell you. But in a nutshell, you need to edit the heck out of your book once you're done writing it. One you feel like it's suitable for publishing, you write a one page query letter to an agent. THe agent will decide if he wants to represent you or not. If so, the agent will present your manuscript to publishers and eventually, if you're lucky, a publisher will want to buy your book.<br>  <br>  Here are few books to help you more:<br>  On Writing by Stephen King<br>  How I Write by Janet Evanovich<br>  Bird By Bird by Anne Lamott<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SS9hE8rnaa	Get a copy of the most recent Writer's Market.

A query letter is a short letter that outlines your book, target audience and why it will sell. You send these to an editor. If the editor likes your letter they will ask for a part or all of your manuscript. If they decide to sign you they will send it out to publishers and hopefully someone will like it and want to publish it. NEVER PAY SOMEONE TO REPRESENT YOU! An editor or agent will take a percentage of what the publisher gives you, never give anyone money upfront. Check out www.writersdigest.com they have a great site with tons of info for writers just starting out. Good Luck!|`|DJOEV2TDaa	Step one: Finish a book  80k words at least
392a91e32207acc30c423125f639d22aaa	As a complicated person, I see more value in simplicity because life and reality always complicate things - if I haven't already.<br>  <br>  1) Love is a complicated choice, it equates to accepting, caring and giving.<br>  <br>  2) Freedom, is the ability to chose bearing in mind the consequences. (To take action or not, simple.)<br>  <br>  3) Justice is the balance of freedom between the individual and the rest.  It is actually one of those complication of reality and of freedom.<br>  <br>  4) The being is not towards death but towards all the choices in life. Death is a punctuation of that living organism.  Death again is one of those many complications of reality.  It is actually the most inconvenient one.  (The whole of reality is too much for one human being to comprehend - except perhaps for a handful of individuals.  Their actions enable their choices to transcend death.)|`|FoIxsunVaa	1) Your statement assumes omniscience. Love is being helpful without being an interference. Nothing is selfless and self-love is a given, even people who think they hate themselves are capable of love. Love does not always benefit anyone.<br>  <br>  2) Metaphysical freedom is a myth.<br>  <br>  3) Love turns justice into a witch-hunt. Justice can be murderous and still be justice.<br>  <br>  4) Death just happens to people. Some deal, some cower. The self is an illusion, so the 'whole self' and the 'whole reality' are nonsense terms.|`|AA11635601	I'll just take on number one, love.<br>  <br>  Love is more like a dance.  It's a mutual activity.  Each person makes themself emotionally available to the other and they feel each others' feelings directly.  If you can do that enough, you get the sensation of love.  It all depends on the emotional connectivity.  It's not a "giving" act, like a backrub, it's more a mutual enjoyment, like dancing or hugging.

IvfAI1S2aa	Personally, I view this as basically nothing. It seems like your trying to entice the reader with a mystery in the Prologue, however, I feel that it's just diarrhea of the brain. You're repetitive, continuously saying the same thing. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be mean or rude, I'm giving you an honest opinion. Mind you, it may be biased considering I saw this would be bad from just reading the part before your Prologue. <br>  <br>  You never put "6" it's a grammatical rule to spell it out unless it's like 1,000,000. Then you would do that. Your grammar needs a bit of work. <br>  <br>  It just seems average so far. Do try to spice it up.<br>  <br>  Also, I pray that not all of chapter one, it's quite short. Along with the fact is says basically nothing to the reader about the person, other than she's bored, hungry and has two brothers. Nothing to the imagination to visualize.<br>  <br>  LET ME ADD ONTO THIS:<br>  <br>  I left it as if it was horrid, with no hope. It's good, from the point of view of a fourteen year old teen girl (me), however if you look at it in a different point of view it needs plenty of work. <br>  <br>  I think it has a potential, again with work, to be a Young Adult novel.

k2NRCYo9aa	If you are a German war hawk, a better place to go might be to keep the United States out of the War.  If that happens, unrestricted submarine warfare succeeds and Britain starves and France capitulates.  <br>  <br>  To do this, they tried to turn Mexico and Japan against the Untied States.  Although nominally with the Allies, Japan could be swayed to help Mexico in a war against the US since there was already Japanese and Mexican animosity against the US.  General Pershing was already on Mexican soil, and the US had already attacked Veracruz so Mexico was not a friend of the US.  If you can get Mexico and Japan to start a war with the United States, not only will the US stay out of the war, but American supplies to Britain also stop.  Submarine warfare strangles Britain, loosens the blockade of Germany, and Germany wins World War I while the United States is still tangled up with Japan and Mexico (although the German Navy then turns against the United States and the US is in a two ocean war along with a ground war either within its borders, or just south of its border).
st3EL0fOaa	Because we were all born with Original Sin that has been passed down since Adam. The only way to atone for this sin is to repent of your sin, to confess it, and to accept Jesus Christ as your savior. All men have sinned.

(John 1:29-34)<br>  <br>  You need to listen to that small voice called conscience and do what is right. But when we do mess up (and we all do) we know we can ask forgiveness of our Father in Heaven adn he is quick to forgive us our sins.

Even when my instrument is working properly, it follows it's own rules (like a CD player plays forwards, not backwards, or any way it wants to.) <br>  <br>  Then there are major conditionals like gravity and the solidity of matter that limit how I can act in the world. next there is the whole web of social interactions maneuvering me by guilt, desire, loyalty, responsibility and fear.<br>  <br>  Finally, I have this myth called a self-identity that says "this is how I expect myself to act." When internal or external forces conspire to make me act uncharacteristically, I feel a sinking feeling.<br>  <br>  When you add up all the minute, major and unseen influences, everything conspires to make decisions for me with the exception of ACTUAL CHOICE.|`|stAeoUeSaa	God and the Bible<br>  besides that... no one|`|096b7gBHaa	Religion. <br>  Past Experiences (that teaches common sense). <br>  Mistakes, to learn (leap before you look)<br>  People's view that sometimes can be bullshit|`|2qDvXCX2aa	I get advice sometimes from a few close friends, but I always decide.

JOChNigNaa	I've been in some of those studios, mostly used for beginner's classes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the interpretations are inspired and inspiring, often downright insulting, fixated on one feature or another exaggerated.  Great artists form a bond of respect with their model(s).  It's not a very comfortable profession.  Your poetic interpretation ranks as fine art.|`|bjrN737daa	Life modelling is not easel-y done, and certainly not a-pealing to most people. One needs to bare ones trueself to do it I understand. That job does not suit everyone's palette. This lady has naked ambition. If she merely sits there while the voyeurs smear their canvases is it a matter of her being in a "Position Vacant"? if she were to lie down would she be in repose? or would it be an imposition? I imagine the painters would all have had a stroke seeing her like that. Her brush with fate has lead her there I sup-pose. That's all I have to say apart from you painted a visual delight here CS! Very artistic.|`|1wOBfgZIaa	Your first stanza is true poetic expression as you subtly describe the model's emotions as dust like empty promises and broken dreams.

SOPRt0Ffaa	I read Cry, the Beloved Country and thought it was great, but it was a while ago. I can't remember the characters' names, but there was a lot of forgiveness in the story. Both fathers (of the killer and the victim) had a lot of forgiveness. Both lost their sons but instead of making them bitter, it caused them to work to make changes in the world. Both repented of not knowing their sons better. The book was an interesting insight into apartheid, and how individuals can overcome injustice.

Not great poetry, just not an eighth grader. Of course eighth grade is like middle aged nowadays right? When I was a kid eighth graders were still kids.<br>  <br>  Young writers (even typical high schoolers) go "The place where" over and over and add stuff on the end.  This poem develops instead of following a "form." That is what I mean by mature.<br>  <br>  Your question about being weird is the weird part. Like you want to PRETEND to be a child. THAT is creepy.
NYU37jfGaa	Well, she was from a small country in what is now Germany, and she was called Sophia Augusta Fredericka (she was given th ename Catherine when she married Grand Duke Peter of Russia).<br>  <br>  When she married Peter, he stayed up all night playing with toy soldiers, which was his favourite occupation.  Catherine was naturally not very happy about this.  When Catherine and Peter finally had children (who may actually have been fathered by someone else) Peter's Aunt Elizabeth, the Empress of Russia, took them away to be brought up by herself.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth died in 1761, and Peter became Emperor.  Peter had fallen in love with someone else, and was planning to divorce Catherine, but with the help of the palace guards she deposed him.  However, instead of acting as regent for her young son Paul, she proclaimed herself ruler.  Peter fortunately died not long afterwards.<br>  <br>  Catherine began by wanting to be an enlightened monarch, influenced by the ideas of philosophres like Voltaire, she wanted to modernise Russia, free the serfs etc, but she became fearful that this would weaken her power, and became more reactionary, and the serfs were not freed until 70 years after her death.  She remained an absolute ruler for the rest of her life.  But she had some very enlightened ideas all the same.<br>  <br>  In 1786 she issued her Statue for Schools, which covered the whole of Russia.  It made provision for schools in every district town, with two teachers, and a 'major school' with six teachers in every provincial town.  Major schools taught mathematics, physics, science, geography, history and religion: pupils who were going on to university would learn Latin and foreign languages.  The schools were free but attendance was not compulsory.  The new system was intended for all and by 1792 every province except the Caucases had a major school.  By 1796 Russi and 316 schools, which taught 16,000 boys and 1121 girls.  22 percent of the pupils were middle class and 30 percent were peasants.<br>  <br>  Catherine opened hospitals, and was particularly interested in combating smallpox, which was a huge killer in those days, especially of children.  Catherine had herself innoculated to set the example for her subjects.  In 1763 she founded Russia's first College of Medicine.  She wanted to train sufficient doctors, surgeons and apothecaries to serve all the provinces.  She decreed that each provincial capital must have a hospital, each county - comprising between twenty and thirty thousand inhabitants - a doctor, a surgeon, an assistant surgeon and a student doctor.<br>  <br>  She gave special attention to orphans, foundlings and unwanted infants.  She built a five-storey foundling Home in Moscow, superior to anything in Europe, which included a lying-in hospital, a church and a dairy farm of eight cows.  Mothers wishing their children to be accepted had to ring a doorbell, a basket was lowered, the mother placed her baby inside and it was drawn up again.  The Moscow Foundling Home took in 2000 infants annually and became the model for smiliar smaller home in other russian towns.  <br>  <br>  She had several lovers in the course of her reign, the one who lasted the longest was Gregory Potemkin, who was still close to her after their affair ended, and remained her chief adviser.<br>  <br>  She worked very hard, and would stay up late at night reading state papers etc, she used to drink gallons of black coffee to keep herself awake.
ppR5kH4Yaa	Assuming the great great grandmother was enrolled, their descendant needs to contact the tribe where their gggrandmother was enrolled.  The tribe will 1) verify that the gggrandmother was enrolled, 2) know the enrolled person's blood quantum, 3) let the requesting person know what the present day enrollment requirements are, and  4) issue an enrollment application.  Assuming the requesting person meets the tribe's enrollment requirements and completes the required paperwork, the tribe will enroll that person and provide them with their enrollment information, including enrollment number.  The tribe is the only authority on who is and who isn't enrolled. The tribe also maintains blood quantum information on all of their enrolled members/citizens.

A sense of proportion is also concerned in the exercise of virtue because evil may be perpetrated when the lesser is chosen in the place of the greater as a result of distortion or deception. The art of relative estimation or comparative measurement enters into the practice of the virtues of the moral realm. Page 193-6|`|AkVT4nbvaa	Heraclitus|`|nJTIGWFfaa	Issac Newton

His face burnt like a brand <br>  As the sweet black waves of perfume came tumbling o'er his breast, <br>  Then he kissed its waves in the moonlight <br>  (O sweet black waves in the moonlight!), <br>  And he tugged at his reins in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west. <br>  <br>  He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon. <br>  And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon, <br>  When the road was a gypsy's ribbon over the purple moor, <br>  The redcoat troops came marching <br>  Marching marching <br>  King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door. <br>  <br>  They said no word to the landlord; they drank his ale instead, <br>  But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed. <br>  Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets by their side; <br>  There was Death at every window, <br>  And Hell at one dark window, <br>  For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride. <br>  <br>  They had bound her up at attention, with many a sniggering jest! <br>  They had tied a rifle beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast! <br>  "Now keep good watch!" and they kissed her. She heard the dead man say, <br>  "Look for me by moonlight, <br>  Watch for me by moonlight, <br>  I'll come to thee by moonlight, though Hell should bar the way." <br>  <br>  She twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good! <br>  She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! <br>  They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years, <br>  Till, on the stroke of midnight, <br>  Cold on the stroke of midnight, <br>  The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! <br>  <br>  The tip of one finger touched it, she strove no more for the rest; <br>  Up, she stood up at attention, with the barrel beneath her breast. <br>  She would not risk their hearing, she would not strive again, <br>  For the road lay bare in the moonlight, <br>  Blank and bare in the moonlight, <br>  And the blood in her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love's refrain. <br>  <br>  Tlot tlot, tlot tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hooves, ringing clear; <br>  Tlot tlot, tlot tlot, in the distance! Were they deaf that they did not hear? <br>  Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, <br>  The highwayman came riding <br>  Riding riding <br>  The redcoats looked to their priming! She stood up straight and still. <br>  <br>  Tlot tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot tlot, in the echoing night! <br>  Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! <br>  Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, <br>  Then her finger moved in the moonlight<br>  Her musket shattered the moonlight<br>  Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death. <br>  <br>  He turned, he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood <br>  Bowed, with her head o'er the casement, drenched in her own red blood! <br>  Not till the dawn did he hear it, and his face grew grey to hear <br>  How Bess, the landlord's daughter, <br>  The landlord's black-eyed daughter, <br>  Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there. <br>  <br>  Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, <br>  With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high! <br>  Blood-red were his spurs in the golden noon, wine-red was h

You  don't realize you are actually under a very complex HYPNOTIZED state of awareness RIGHT NOW. <br>  <br>  Ordinary consciousness (second state) is just one of the four levels of consciousness that are possible to us. First state is what we normally call "sleep" but ordinary consciousness isn't all that far removed from this "sleep". The third state of consciousness is very far from us but it is the beginning of reaching our REAL  self.

FZ0hwowaaa	NAZI leader, Hitler was fascinated by Indian Occult Science. So swastika is just one simple item he copied from the Ancient Indian Culture. He strongly followed Indian myths, culture, taboos, occult science etc.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Since the original Aryans came from India, it is not unusual that a version of the swastika would also be found in ancient Germanic cultures.  Interestingly, the swastika is also found in Native American culture as well.<br>  <br>  The Nazi version was turned at an angle, however, and therefore does not resemble the "straight-on" Hindu or Native American version.|`|dSLCH5gHaa	The hindu symbol stood for peace and love, when the nazis flipped it around it stood for hate and war. At least thats my knowing of the subject.|`|VXQFT341aa	Its the same. The use of the swastika was associated by Nazi theorist with their conjecture of Aryan culture decent of the German People.Following the Nordistic versions of the Aryan invasion theory. The Nazis claimed that the early Aryans of India were the prototypical white invaders. So Hitler choose the swastika.

7f8FtSw2aa	The answer, as others have said, is Lindy Hop<br>  <br>  Lindy Hop evolved (as the music changed) into many other dances after WW2.<br>  <br>  Lindy Hop was 'revived' back in the late 80's and has been growing in popularity since the early 90's.<br>  <br>  Many popular dances today under the "Swing" umbrella came from Lindy Hop, including West Coast Swing (which also takes influence from Blues dancing, latin dancing and to a lesser extent Ballroom), Modern Jive or Ceroc (which takes a lot of influence from Ballroom), East Coast Swing (which is like a stripped down version of Lindy Hop) and Rock and Roll (which is kind of like East Coast Swing, but with rock 'n' roll music).|`|xQwU590Laa	Lindy is still danced today.  Also Jitterbug, East Coast Swing, and west coast swing.|`|UediSxFbaa	Lindy Hop is still danced today, while not so popular. <br>  <br>  Other styles that might be similar are swing, rock'n'roll dancing and some forms of jive
srlKcvBLaa	Grease paint is basically a type of stage makeup which sticks and is quite thick. The reason why i would say it isn't as popular as it once was is because it is so hard to get off once it is on and when it is applied it is so thick that it's quite uncomfortable to wear as an actor. In my opinion with the development of stage makeup in the past few years there's so many better, more comfortable options on the market that unless you were going for the greasepaint look i wouldn't recommend it.

S01zIagOaa	First you must start acting as in learn the art of acting. Most indie films, even student films, cast professional actors or other university students who are also actors trying to build their reels in order to climb up the ladder. So to that end, you must first get yourself into some acting classes and develop those skills that will make you an actor worth casting. Second, as a minor you will still need your parents support and permission to actually work on a production.  Once you've set yourself on that path you will use the business tools most other actors use to find casting notices. Craiglist, Showfax, castingnetworks.com etc.

But the rest of us can't swallow religious dogma, because there's no evidence. Nobody can prove that there life after death, that people are tortured or rewarded after life or that there's invisible spirits running around.<br>  <br>  I've come to two conclusions within the past years and a half:<br>  <br>  1. Life has no meaning<br>  2. Life has a million meanings.<br>  <br>  First, there's a certainty that death and annihilation awaits not only you, but the Earth in general. It's an astonomical certainty that our sun will supernova and leave the earth a burnt crisp, not to mention all the other extinction level events around the corner.<br>  <br>  Second, the million things that give us meaning are the pleasurable experiences we can conjure up during the short period we are here on the earth, in the form of the relationships we have with our kids and other people, and the 'housekeeping' types of purposes. What i mean by that are the curing disease, ending hunger, improving literacy, reducing crime, preventing war, helping other kinds of things. <br>  <br>  So the bottom line is, we only have a temporary meaning to life, to reduce pain and increase pleasure, other than that everything is lost to oblivion. <br>  <br>  To be or not to be?

What is your first thought? Party?  Orgy? Drink?  Spend time with friends and family?  Something for yourself?  Something for Others?  <br>  Will you look at your life and try to have a life with meaning if you find an answer true?  <br>  Are you willing to seriously look at the answers and think about them AND the effect on your life?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well here are my pre-conditions for the answer if you actually want an answer.<br>  1) Yours and many others willingness to search for that answer shows that there is almost a universal need for an answer. Why am I here etc. has been a question repeated thousands of times on here alone.  <br>  2) A minority will try to deny meaning because a meaningless life frees them of any responsibility and accountability to anyone but themselves but to most this rings false and hollow..<br>  3) The implied and explicit implications of there being an objective meaning will be hated by those with the desire to deny accountability, right wrong etc. and engage in a narcissistic. This self absorbed lifestyle "frees" the deniers to live as debauched a life as they want, just read up on Nietzche, he died with syphilis in a mental hospital.<br>  <br>  OBSERVATIONS<br>  The atheist Aldus Huxley clearly said "I want this world not to have meaning because a meaningless world frees me to my own erotic and political pursuits.".  A life without meaning is no more than chemical reactions and has no meaning, no true and false, no love just chemical reactions and a hopeless end.  That idea "frees" some to live the lifestyles they choose and gnaws away at the heart of most mankind who want justice, good to prevail and evil to be punished.   <br>  <br>  C.S. Lewis was an atheist that declared God and Jesus were myths but after spending time with JRR Tolkien and looking at the evidence became a very strong Christian and pronouncer of the Gospel.  Here is what he says about life having meaning:<br>  "If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning."<br>  <br>  METHODOLOGY<br>  It was the philosopher Francis Bacon that said "A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."  Do you just want a superficial bandaid answer?<br>  <br>  I say lets us dig past the surface and given the almost universal need for meaning, justice, hope, love, etc. then in my investigation there is the one philosophy that would best fit the heart of man as corrupt but offers the evidence and hope of justice is Christianity. We can see a "good man" cheat on his wife, etc. and this shows that every man is fallen but those that honestly take Jesus into their hearts are changed and even though they may fail and sin on occasion. <br>  Lostness of Man<br>  <a href="http://www.rzim.org/CA/Resources/Listen/LetMyPeopleThink.aspx?archive=1&pid=1243" rel="nofollow">http://www.rzim.org/CA/Resources/Listen/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rzim.org/CA/Resources/Listen/LetMyPeopleThink.aspx?archive=1&pid=1249" rel="nofollow">http://www.rzim.org/CA/Resources/Listen/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  CONCLUSIONS<br>  Conclusion Summary<br>  Given these criteria and evidences I see that the Bible has best answers and that in it's simplest definition, Life is a test. <br>  <br>  In this test the results are based on how we serve God, Love God and accept Jesus as Lord and do God's will we  will be judged. Now we must recognize that all have fallen short and sinned, have false pride etc. so we need to sincerely repent and those that reject God's love and Jesus' sacrifice will fail the test.  God has provided a method of passing based on the sacrifice of Jesus as seen in John 3: 14-19. The rewards of those that do pass are based on doing God's will and from reading the Bible I believe that every action in our life will have a consequence for good or evil.  <br>  <br>  Conclusion details<br>  In the end our purpose is found in what Jesus said, that he came to save the lost, so that we can help those we can such as the poor, the orphans, the widows and the sick and finally by following him we are to have "peace that the world cannot", so that we may "live more abundantly".  So you see that the meaning of life is the relationship with God and another part is the relationship with each other. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:37-40;&version=50;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  Now Jesus came to pay for our sins and to change our hearts and so that we may live better here, even persecuted, and pay for the sins our actions never could!<br>  John 10:10<br>  "I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly"<br>  <br>  <br>  Henry Drummond talks about love and our relationship with God in his book "The Greatest thing in the World", I think it is a good read and here is a link where it is available for free online.  <br>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739</a><br>  <br>  If you were sincere enough in your search to read this far then finally and simply the meaning is found in worshipping God,  God's Love, Jesus' love and sacrifice and our love to others and that relationship.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:1-8;&version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  May you learn as well as ask, may you investigate truth as well as hearing an answer.<br>  Bai|`|90oHw9CLaa	the sum of the distinguishing phenomena of organisms, esp. metabolism, growth, reproduction, and adaptation to environment.|`|Dug6yDOLaa	the meaning of life is not to know the meaning, but to discover what means the most to you in life. =]|`|EhEdOojOaa	Love, find love and let love find you.

I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU!!|`|WgcItNCeaa	I don't hate them.<br>  Massie is exceedingly mean and cruel though.|`|4RDReOBxaa	thats what makes the books interesting though. i think they'd be really bad if she was super nice all the time|`|AA11902420	first of all: its a book. lighten up please. she's supposed to be awful. massie is insecure, and jealous and just a vulnerable girl with a credit card and quick wit to protect her. jeez. but that's the point. it's fun to watch her scramble in alliances and try to come out on top. it's so ridiculous, that it's entertaining. that's what books are meant for: entertainment. and if you don't like them anymore, well, just stop reading them. give it a rest. they're not haunting you. just put them down and be done with it.<br>  and about tyra. i'm sure she was saying that she admires the actors, not the characters. and even if she were praising the characters, is that so unlike her? i mean, she's tyra banks. she gave miley cyrus a picture of herself for her birthday. don't you watch the soup?  <br>  so, in conclusion, read something else. may i suggest the mediator series by meg cabot? at least in those books, no LIVING person maliciously tries to ruin other peoples' lives.|`|VbvrG9NJaa	I kind of do... <br>  But I mean like they aren't real they are just made up characters that some person just made up. <br>  Oh yeah I only read one of those so far and when I was checking it out from the libray the librarian read the title then at me then at the title and asked why I am reading this well I couldn't think of an answer then but now I know I would have said "Because its a different veiw of middel school"  <br>  And another thing is that there is always good and bad people in books.|`|HHOfEmZDaa	i love the clique books, but i agree that massie is really mean !|`|kLNhAEVpaa	ME TOO!!

heF3HIzQaa	They started sending convicts to Australia shortly after the American Revolution and they could no longer send them to America.<br>  <br>  As to why they exported criminals at all, basically they didn't want them in Britain! It gave them a chance to get rid of social undesirables, reducing the population of urban poor without having to hang them all. Many transported convicts were originally sentenced to hang but had their sentences commuted.<br>  <br>  Also note the real 'crime' of many of these prisoners was being poor, and many transported prisoners went on to become upstanding and prosperous citizens of Australia. Those that survived the often brutal conditions long enough to make a fresh start that is.<br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend reading the first few chapters of Robert Hugh's 'The Fatal Shore'. A great book on the subject including a lot of first hand accounts. The first half of the book is a great read. After that it starts talking about social policy and regulations and is as boring as bat pooh. So read the first half twice instead.|`|LYausP2Eaa	wasn't it so that they could mine for them and then the austrailians hit gold and the first gold minners there were the reason that austrialians broke away from britains because they started their first democracy. but also britain had autrialians storing nuclear weapons. or something like that, i dont know the history chnl had something about it on a few days ago

VpvGzLsUaa	hey i'm a girl and i really don't care if a guy can dance or not. if you want to dance with her than ask her to dance, and even if the song playing is hip hop/rock/etc it doesn't matter, start slow dancing with her, if she asks why then smile and say that the music doesn't matter, as long as your with her (idk i think that sounds sweet, she would probably love that) and just compliment her, even the cheesiest things will be fine, just don't hit on her. Just compliments like "your eyes are beautiful, its like i can see into your soul, and i like what i'm seeing" stuff like that would work. If she smiles and looks at you, stare into her eyes, not her body.<br>  <br>  If you can't slow dance either, its really easy. Put your hands at her waist or shoulder and just sway with her, move back and forward and then side to side, if you can, spin her around like in all the romantic movies. Always smile. <br>  <br>  BTW i'm a 7th grade girl so i may not know much. I think i over did it. he he. <br>  <br>  But don't worry. Maybe she won't want to dance, or maybe she can't dance either.|`|ZBruGcDQaa	well to slow dance, you put your arms at her waist, and there is not way to teach someone to fast dance, it just comes naturally

Aside from copyright violation, and it just being pathetic, a story based on someone elses' idea might clash with the author's writing style, and not click with the reader. Don't write a story if you don't already have a plot.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Apparently it has to have a vampire in it, according to the last person that I responded to in my Q & A|`|w9fPmOmVaa	hmmm. Maybe you could have a potential romace scene but her mother walks in. This always leaves the reader thinking "what if her mother hadn't walked in" or "God why don't they just DO IT already?"<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is maybe, if Derek is into drugs/alcohol himself he could pressure Evalynn into tyring it. Bad choices always stir up the crowd.

They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.
TjjPm5P1aa	The show follows the main story line of the first book however there are many differences.  There are characters that are in the hbo series that do not really appear until later in the books.  I read the books prior to watching the series and was a little disappointed in the series.

mnOjqnLJaa	I preface this with an apology that my answer isn't very specific.<br>  <br>  Look through your drawings and see what you like about them. Do you like how people come out? Or certain objects? Or flowers? Pick what you think came out good, but also what you like to draw.<br>  <br>  Then go through the drawings that have whatever you liked in them. Say that you liked how your drawings of people look. Get a lot of them out and go through them. Decide what you consistently see as a strength or weakness. Like "I like how the eyes came out in this one, but not in this one". "I seem to have trouble with noses/arms/fingers/etc."<br>  <br>  After you've decided what specific areas you need to improve, set to doing so. Get reference images if you can, so that you can compare while you are drawing. "Is this coming out looking right?" -- check it to the reference image.<br>  <br>  (Personally, I like to draw people, especially if there are a couple of them in the drawing.)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|qrjqYAHtaa	take a class, join an art community like deviantART, spend some time with some talented people....being with great artists is very inspiring.

Dancing stiff looks mechanical not natural. By your question is seems that you have a dancing background so this should be easy and familiar to you. Don't worry about it. Just have fun. I'm sure you would do great. And i don't know if your school is the same as my school but having a good background in what your trying out for is a big advantage in mine. Good luck!
nE5eqyWeaa	LYRIC VERSE <br>  One of the three main groups of poetry, the others being narrative and dramatic. By far the most frequently used form in modern poetic literature, the term lyric includes all poems in which the speaker's ardent expression of a (usually single) emotional element predominates. Ranging from complex thoughts to the simplicity of playful wit, the power and personality of lyric verse is of far greater importance than the subject treated. Often brief, but sometimes extended in a long elegy or a meditative ode, the melodic imagery of skillfully written lyric poetry evokes in the reader's mind the recall of similar emotional experiences. <br>  <br>  Now there's a primer you can do the rest of the work yourself.

Some people write as if they were robots; the only emotion being layed out in writing "She sobbed."  <br>  <br>  I enjoy reading essays or books where the writer isn't afriad to include something like "Hah!

Sixteen-year-old Princess Quinn's only diversion in the underground kingdom of Mandria consists of watching the "outer-earth" people through the waters of a wishing pool. Betraying his master's trust, an apprentice wizard sends Quinn to the outer world, where she meets up with teenagers Sally and Adam Dover and their mysteriously wise grandfather Mondo. One day melts into the next, and soon the princess wishes to keep her newfound life-and love-even when Mondo tells her a terrible, cautionary secret. Then Quinn learns that she is in mortal danger, and must put her emotions aside and act to save not only herself, but all Mandria."

AA12016117	Only 33%-55% of the population in Tudor times lived beyond the age of 16.  Childhood was dangerous; they had the same infant illnesses as we do today, and more besides.  Yet they had no medical knowledge of how to treat or cure them.  You could die of a broken bone, or even toothache.<br>  <br>  Towns were probably more dangerous because of the open sewers, and London, for instance, experienced the plague several times along with malaria, smallpox, diphtheria, etc, and other mysterious epidemics like the sweating sickness, tertian fever, quartan fever.  <br>  <br>  Of the plague:<br>  <br>  "In 1563, in London alone, over 20,000 people died of the disease. This particular epidemic claimed between a quarter and a third of the total Elizabethan London population.

But, from her perspective, all she wanted to do was have a friendly conversation with lennie. You see, there is a tie between when Lennie breaks Curley's hand, and when he kills Curley's wife. Do you remember Curley had a glove of vaseline, keeping it soft for his wife. Lennie likes to pet soft things, so he crushed his hand because it is soft. And he broke Curley's wife's neck because he wanted to pet her SOFT hair.

f4Nn0W1xaa	He's listed as a producer, really he just paid for the studio time. He was the manager of the band too for awhile, along with another guy, and he introduced them to Nico. He featured the band in his Exploding Plastic Inevitable events, which is pretty much how they got their start. He and Lou Reed ended up arguing about the direction of the band and Reed severed ties with Warhol finally.
D2JW4wKxaa	A picture can't really be described in vector graphics. Vector graphics would describe an image in terms of lines starting at X Y coordinates, going a certain angle, for a certain distance. Further description could include width, or color. It's display on the screen is scalable because it's appearance can be calculated based on the definitions of the object. This is very efficient for line based drawings because a few bytes can be used to describe an object that covers a considerable distance. The object being described is not real though. It is a digital description of a theoretical object. <br>  <br>  You can't do the same with a picture because your original source data, the subject you are photographing, is analog, not digital. There are continuous changes in the luminance and color values from one pixel to the next. Even if you shot a plain white wall, you will discover that there are shading changes across it, and small variances that give the image texture. If you removed them with your paint program you will have noticeable blemish in the image that looks very unreal. If you put something as complex as a person in the image the changes will be everywhere from black to white and all over the color spectrum. To try and reduce that to a vector description would create a cartoon look rather than a photograph. To preserve your detail the vector description would have to describe each pixel individually, but then it would not really be vector graphics anymore, it would be bitmap and nothing would be gained. <br>  <br>  It is not a question of the speed of processors, it is driven by the nature of the data you are trying to display. The reason you can't scale the picture up without loss of quality is that you are asking the computer to display data that was not originally captured by the camera. Current imaging elements are very good and in many cases exceed the resolution of the lens on the camera. You can't ask the computer to display data that never made it through the lens. You can only ask it to calculate a probable value for what was between the pixels it did capture.|`|WaJdOaFKaa	Great idea, but to be honest with you, the amount of processing power required to produce a vector based image output would be tremendous, compared to a raster image.  Approaching "artificial" intelligence, even.  It takes a line artist hours to render even a moderately detailed vector, imagine having to duplicate the level of detail required for the average 12 megapixel image.  There's simply too much fine detail.  Although, I do agree that vector-based printing technologies would be the next logical step.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of vexeling, or rather, the marriage of both pixel and vector based rendering.  But the bottom line is, fine detail is what makes raster based graphics the better choice for digital photography.  Photography and line art:  two completely different things.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Yes vector files are scalable but we would still need to think in terms of "resolution" in the sense that the files would only be good as the level of vector detailing put into them.<br>  <br>  Think about converting a 50x50 pixel file to vectors where every pixel or gradation in color has its own vector. It would be scalable but of very limited detail. Doing this on a larger file, lets say 2000x3000 pixels would result in a staggering file size - scalable yes but again  the detail would be limited by the number of vectors used to draw or map out the image. Photographers and printers would still always be striving for more detail as we are today.<br>  <br>  Obviously raster files are the most efficient way of doing this so I think they will be here for quite some time to come.
qdlmy4l8aa	Hmm. I would say there is little difference between lyric poems and song lyrics, well, not so that they can be easily PICKED out. It's more the writer's intent. But, the meter of a poem is more or less dictated by the number of syllables in a line, (if we're talking about poems that rhyme) so the rhyming patterns are pretty well fixed. With regards to songs, a syllable doesn't necessarily count for ONLY one beat. There can be intervening beats between words or syllables so that lines of completely unequal length can still rhyme just as well. I'd also say that with poems, the rhythm is carried in the WORDS rather than with drums or rhythm guitar.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Of course songs are poetry!

BBfIXcI0aa	If you're using a monologue, make sure it's a good monologue (your gender and age range, and active, meaning your character is talking to someone and not just reminiscing or telling a story.) Memorise the piece thorougly, so thoroughly that you can do it standing on your head while people are throwing things at you. (If you have friends willing to help, actually HAVE them throw things at you while you try to recite it.)<br>  <br>  It helps if you memorise the piece by standing up straight and physically behaving the way you will at the audition - your body will use the muscle memory to help your brain remember the words.<br>  <br>  Once you have the words down, think about the character you're playing for the audition. What have they been through that prompted them to say this? Who are you talking to? What have you been through that will help you connect to them at this point? What do they want in this monologue, and how are they trying to get it?<br>  The trick to monologues is to focus on trying to get what your character wants rather than trying to act it out - if you're really fighting for what you want, then emotions and stuff will come on their own.<br>  <br>  If you're just reading from a script for the audition, be as familiar with the show as possible before you go, and make the character your own. Don't be afraid to make bold choices when you're reading.<br>  <br>  Even though you've never been trained, it doesn't mean you can't act.

kacLYFrHaa	Death camps were concentration camps. As were work camps. Concentration camps were places where victims of the holocaust were concentrated (outside of the ghettos). Once they arrived they were sent either to the death camp portion of the camp or the work camp portion, depending on their age, physical condition, if they were deemed suitable for experimentation, and if more slave labor was needed. If no more souls were needed in the work camp for the time being, then those who came into the concentration camp were sent to their deaths in the death camp. It didn't matter if they were men, women, or children. And once they had outlived their usefulness in the work camp they were moved to the death camp.|`|N8UKu0WUaa	i dont think so, i think it would have been the other way around. the death camps were for killing people who couldnt be used as forced labour, so i would think men would more often be able to be used for forced labour than women...<br>  <br>  the only reason i can think of as to why they would prefer to get rid of the men is because they may have thought the men would be more difficult to control-- however i doubt this since they didnt really have to worry about that-- they cared more about getting their slave labourers, and killing people who couldnt work as labourers|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Concentration camps, also called "death camps" are one in the same.|`|z3ZlTMyxaa	its practically the same exact thing. but yes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can u help me out wit mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvlSw0WeMrQp28b1H_Isknbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222173014AA5Xjcd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Concentration camps were mostly occupied by men who were criminals, homosexuals, political dissidents or other "undesireables" during the early days of the Nazi regime.

agwxFmITaa	I thought at first that you had written this and that I was in the presence of genius!  The fish in the stone is a fossil.  He is exposed to the bright lights of a laboratory. He is weary of being examined by humans and yearns for the silence of the long ago ocean he came from.  He knows that by 'failing' i.e. dying and being forever in the stone he is helping mankind to know about the past.  A gangster's funeral - lots of people in black but in this case ants caught in pieces of amber (orange = garish) so they are there for all to see.  Secret delight is the knowledge (and the pleasure) the scientist will get from running his fingers over something formed millions of years ago.  It is a beautiful poem.

dTOiazUpaa	No no no! haha Well, as you know Ariana tried to kill Reed and Noelle saved her.  After that Ariana is taken to this place called Brenda T. and its a jail. SPOILERS: IF YOU PLAN TO READ PRIVILEGE WHERE THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE IN, I SUGGEST YOU DONT KEEP READING =]. She makes this master plan to escape the prison. And she makes it look like she committed suicide. So she can fool the police. Once she does she kill this girl who looks like Ariana. She puts the girl in the lake with her jail clothes on and her special necklace. The police find the body they've been looking for and close the case. Everyone, including her family and old friends think that shes dead, but she really isnt!<br>  <br>  Read Privilege! Its really good. It the prequel to the private series.

Where they could start a new life and get PAID for it! All needed of them were to do some harmless tesing on their psycic powers on a regular basis(or so they thought). Soon Kaitlyn is sent clues that Mr.Zetes is up to no-good with his researching, she starts getting suspicious. And it doesnt help that the messenger is put into a mysterious coma soon after. It was THEN that she decided to find out about Mr.Zetes and what he really wants from them. She and the others decide to search for the truth and they find a secret...(nope cant tell you that)well files that...(Nope cant tell you that either)Sorry. Well what I CAN tell, is that on their mission for the truth Gabriel makes a mistake and links them all into a stable psycic link. Which makes them read into each other's thoughts.

But then Kaitlyn and Gabe are caught into a bad situation, they are trapped with Mr.Zetes with no power to hold against him...."<br>  <br>  "This first part of the trilogy begins in Ohio, and introduces the reader to Kaitlyn and her powers which is to predict the future trought her and others vision and draw it before it happens. Joyce Piper arrives and asks her to participate in a parapsychology study at the Zetes Institute in San Carlos, CA in exchange for a generous college scholarship. While reluctant at first, Kait decides to take this after a tragic reminder of her inability to control her powers or interpret her own drawings. She arrives at the Institute and enjoys a happy life of having friends, popularity, and pursuing her love interest, Rob. However, things become more sinister as she begins to get warnings that things might not be what they seem at the Institute (from the yet unknown LeShan, Marisol, and Kait's own drawings). Marisol unexpectly falls into a coma after Kait reveals her warnings to Joyce. This becomes the final event which forces Kait to realize that the Institute is to good to be true. During one attempt to find out what Mr. Zetes is planning, Kait and her group are telepathically linked by Gabriel."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Visions_Trilogy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Vision...</a>|`|vZToCRVuaa	idk|`|ikUQfpd9aa	Skydancers?

Any program that can use a "green screen" can usually use any other color you want. It could be a red screen, yellow or whatever. But, because this color, the green screen,  is not used, as said, for clothing, houses, etc.. its a safe color for the computer to be told to ignore.....<br>  <br>  And that is what you tell the computer to do.. Ignore "this" color.. This is why you could have any color screen you want, and at one time they had a color - non repro-blue - that was used instead of this strange green today.<br>  <br>  As far as price goes, way too many things control prices across the country. Our prices here in Tucson, AZ do not reflect the prices in Nome, Alaska for the same items, even if from the same 'store'...<br>  <br>  I would look for some solid color bed sheets in the most awful solid color to be found and tell the program THIS is the color to ignore...<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson

hCsAHDjNaa	In musicals, the middle of it when it just gets tiring and you get sick of spending your entire afternoon in rehearsal, going over the same dance routines and songs over and over and no matter how perfect you're doing it, there's always someone messing up and you have to start ever. Basically, when it gets tedious.<br>  <br>  In plays, when no matter how you say a line, the director never likes the way you say it and feels the need to correct you. On every single syllable of every single line.<br>  <br>  And just because I like being optimistic, I want to make a point that every actor knows that through all the blood, sweat and tears, there is no rush like a performer's rush on opening night, knowing you went out there and nailed it and all your hard work paid off, and that even though it was torture at the time, looking back you know how much you love theatre and you remember why you put all the effort into it in the first place. For the love of the theatre. :D|`|GLS7vgAdaa	The only thing I HATE is when you have to play a scene with someone who doesn't take it as seriously as you do. I was in a play once with this one kid who never knew his lines, never remember the lyrics to his songs and never came to the extra dance rehearsals that were mandatory for everyone. What made it worse was, somehow he pulled everything together for opening night and stole the show. I'm glad he didn't ruin everything but it completely undermined everyone else's hard work and concentration. <br>  Another thing I can't stand is working with a director that feels he's the only one with good ideas and is offended if you offer yours. In such a creative process as theatre is I always welcome good advice and never stifle anyone's creative juices. I mean, when we've all come together with a passion for the same thing, what's the point of knocking anyone down and acting the part of a dictator?

3L4citcnaa	This is such a broad question. The listed answers are certainly good ones: Poe is just such a genius in his poetry, though a bit dark. Dickinson's works just have such deep levels to them. "Hope is the thing with feathers" is another good one from her. <br>  <br>  Of course, if you're speaking of American poets, you cannot leave out Walt Whitman and his "Leaves of Grass." Many consider him to be one of the greatest American poets, though he is not my favorite. <br>  <br>  Robert Frost is great; his poems are often easy to understand, and he is a well-known American poet. Try "Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood" or "Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening." They are just marvelous.|`|4yq5ZrCDaa	Check out Edgar Allen Poe's work.<br>  <br>  "The Raven" is really good and full of metaphors.|`|vVd8yFdIaa	I agree that Poe is an excellent choice, though there are so many others.  Take a look at "The Haunted Palace" by Poe--it can be found within the story "The Fall of the House of Usher."  Emily Dickinson's work is also full of interesting figurative language.  Perhaps her most famous poem is "Because I Could Not Stop for Death."  The entire poem is an extended metaphor.  Likewise with her poem "Hope if the Thing With Feathers."
0RvtrkYOaa	Nope, having studied it for over 25 years I have yet to find a good source that could change my mind.  Most of the conspiracy 'facts' are twisted pieces of information used to make you (the reader) believe what they (the theorists) want you to.  <br>  <br>  The geocities page (the Pearl Harbor - Mother of all Conspiracies) is full of rubbish and nonsense that for anyone who hasn't studied it, might sound good, but a bit of common sense allows you to look right though it.  I especially love this line: "Warnings do no harm and might do inexpressible good", ever heard cry wolf, that's exactly what was going on.  Too many warnings with nothing happening diluted the effect.<br>  <br>  The 'war with Germany' part is very laughable.  In all honesty, from letters from Japanese officials in Washington and Tokyo, Japan believed Germany wanted Japan to go to war, not so Germany could declare war, but so US attention would be focused AWAY from Europe, not towards it.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but the simple fact is, even dating back to the 1920s US intelligence believed the US would be in a war with Japan.  It would begin with Japan declaring war and within 24 hours and attack would occur.

AA12228381	No, rarely do you every, at any audition have to 'make it up as you go'.  Most auditions have 'copy' you get either the night before or when you get to the audition.<br>  <br>  That being said, I'm a little worried about you listing this as an "Open Disney Casting Call".  Disney doesn't do, or need to do, open calls.  They have more than enough people breaking down their doors to even have to worry about having an 'open call'.  My question to you is this:  Is this part of some 'tour' that is going around the US looking for the next 'star' for Disney or Nickelodeon, etc?  Please let me (us) know you general geographic location (big city or closest big city) and the 'company' this is being done thought to better advise you to whether or not this is a scam hoping you'll pay them big $$$$ for what is essentially nothing.|`|ntYEImPlaa	I think they might give you a script to work with when you're there. you might also have to sing?! i was watching the miley cyrus audition for Hannah Montana and she had to sing in it.

SygvUa0Eaa	Ha, my name's Brian!<br>  <br>  Anyway... It really just depends on the story. Is it romance? Action? Fantasy? <br>  <br>  For a basic boot-kickin': You can kill him? Whether it's hit by a car, shot in the chest, or plain suicide. You can do it however you want!<br>  <br>  You can also: Have him run away? Move somewhere else? Transfer schools? Who knows. There's a whole ton of possibilities.

Or you can kill him off - a car accident, a tumble in the bathtub, a skiing accident or whatever.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	You're probably going to have to do some editing, because simply killing a character is a very amateurish way to get rid of a character. When you kill a character, the death of the character must always have a purpose, not like real life where deaths are often random and have no purpose. You're probably going to have to make him important somehow. Don't simply have him move away, unless it has purpose to the story. <br>  <br>  There is no easy answer to getting rid of him, but all I can tell you is if you do get rid of him, make sure it has an overall effect to the story. Remember, everything you write, everything your characters do, everything that happens to your characters, must have a purpose. You cannot have random events happen. You cannot simply have Brian get hit by a car...and there, it's done. Even if Brian gets hit by a car, there must be some sort of reason behind it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: jab has a good answer as well.|`|V1Zje2KYaa	Well, I'm assuming you don't want to kill him off, as that's melodramatic.  You are not obligated to bring him up again, but if you want to, you can have a main character drop a one-liner about him later, mentioning something he did that fits with his character.  Something flippant and related to the things we know about him, such as<br>  a) "Oh, yeah, he joined the Peace Corps"<br>  b) "Brian?  Yes, I saw him the other night at Club Monsoon, chatting up a redhead half his age"<br>  c) "You know that guy you used to date?  I saw him bagging groceries at Dominick's the other day"<br>  d) "I just read this amazing book that changed my life, all about how women drive men away when they" (reference something the main character did) "Now I know never to do that!  I'll lend you a copy of the book if you want, it's by a guy called Brian Hoffenmeyer..."<br>  e) "Oh, man, I met this guy at the bar last night and I'm totally in love.  I hope he calls me back!  His name's Brian, Brian Hoffenmeyer; isn't that just the greatest name ever?"<br>  f) "Hello, my name's Brian and I'll be your server this evening.

y8bFwXZEaa	Because he equates natural law with Final Cause, which comes from the First Cause and that is God.<br>  Look up Aquinas and "causes".|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Natural law, as defined by Aquinas, is an in-born inclination.  He describes it as an imprint on each being or object deriving from the eternal law which formed all of existance.  And he also says that it is natural law which lets us know the difference between good and evil.  So perhaps the most accessible way to sum up this concept is to think of it as kind of like conscience and instinct all rolled into one:  these are things you're born with and which guide you instead of the other way around.<br>  <br>  Divine law, again by Aquinas' definition, is a supplement.  We are not born knowing divine law, but we need it to gain perspective on things larger than ourselves and as a counterbalance to some of our other traits.  He argues that if we were only being tasked with doing things within our capabilities, we wouldn't need divine law, but since our goal is perfection, we need something to make up the difference between what we're capable of undertaking and what is expected of us.<br>  <br>  To Aquinas, these two have to be in accord because they essentially stem from the same source:  that master plan which is eternal law.<br>  <br>  Arguably, since the whole point of divine law is to help us avoid things we might otherwise be inclined to do, almost any of them can be taken as an example of an apparent conflict.  For example, we might say that the virtue of chastity seems to be in conflict with our natural desire to have sex.  A proponent of Aquinas' notions, however, would probably just say that we desire to have sex because it is a good thing to do but the divine law exists to provide us with the proper framework to do it in.  Such a person would probably then point out the vast number of problems that seem to occur when the divine law is ignored:  children to mothers too young to care for them properly, broken families, and even sexual addiction and so on.<br>  <br>  My take, for what it's worth.  Hope that helps!

But the rest of us can't swallow religious dogma, because there's no evidence. Nobody can prove that there life after death, that people are tortured or rewarded after life or that there's invisible spirits running around.<br>  <br>  I've come to two conclusions within the past years and a half:<br>  <br>  1. Life has no meaning<br>  2. Life has a million meanings.<br>  <br>  First, there's a certainty that death and annihilation awaits not only you, but the Earth in general. It's an astonomical certainty that our sun will supernova and leave the earth a burnt crisp, not to mention all the other extinction level events around the corner.<br>  <br>  Second, the million things that give us meaning are the pleasurable experiences we can conjure up during the short period we are here on the earth, in the form of the relationships we have with our kids and other people, and the 'housekeeping' types of purposes. What i mean by that are the curing disease, ending hunger, improving literacy, reducing crime, preventing war, helping other kinds of things. <br>  <br>  So the bottom line is, we only have a temporary meaning to life, to reduce pain and increase pleasure, other than that everything is lost to oblivion. <br>  <br>  Whether we're alone or not, the probability is high that there is life out there other than our (see Drake's equation)...|`|t2059Apeaa	1:  No.  <br>  #2:  Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, "The purpose of life lies not in prospering, but in the development of the soul."<br>  Now, let's tie those two together: earth is not our home.

And speaking of "hope," the assumption of support; isn't "love" also the assumption of care?  Therefore i think a psychologist would say to possess the psychological miliu (the changes of the mind) and have the ability to affect them so much as to gain "control." Thus the purpose of life is to possess the ability to understand and control.<br>  <br>  And since each person can attain the ability and the understanding, wisdom to do either good or bad. We are not bound to good or bad doings, but rather pushed and shoved by society on its way to shape us. And in every aspect of life, the manifestation of good is so forced that it can be said that each person is imprinted "morality." This is proven by the definition of the psychological belief that "each person is born with the intention to prosper. <br>  <br>  Paradoxically, according to my reasoning & logic, there's no such thing as a "pessimist." Think About It: Even a pessimist who wills himself to do horrible things, such as committing suicide, is having a goal (to die) backed up by the assumption of support (that he or she won't feel pain, or experience a particular event anymore) and works through it (by actually doing the action of suicide), thus we can say that suicide is a goal, achieved by action, in the assumption of peace, or support fulfills a person's will. -- Isn't that being a optimist? Having a goal, working for it, in the assumption that they will gain peace or good, or something they want. <br>   <br>  Oh, you say that a pessimist is unhappy and a optimist is happy. Well think about happiness, isn't it just a instinctive, conditioned response (if someone tells you to feel sad when you are given something, you'll become sad instead of happy in the future). What we can really define happiness in the definition of "will." When happiness can be shaped and molded, the only truth in it is that when an outcome is "willed"<br>  by you (wanted, desired consciously or unconsciously), you become happy. So happiness is not define whether a person is a optimist or a pessimist, but "will." It is why people define the difference by what the person wills him or herself to feel that makes them either pessimist or optimist. But if an pessimist willed their way to suicide, ended in an desired conclusion, then it's not being an pessimist! <br>  <br>  Well this is just two kind of perspectives, with my own opinion and assumption. sorry if its so long xD|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Not everybody is alone.

hCsAHDjNaa	I understand that this your dream and everything but the truth is that it isn't enough just to want it. And it sounds to me like you don't want to act as much as you just want to be famous. You have to love it, and be born to it. I do stage plays and musicals, and no offense its a little bit insulting to someone who really loves to act.<br>  But you need to start small. Audition for your school play. If your school only does musicals, audition at a community theatre. After you get some experience and see if you actually do love acting, search for agencies in your area and get an agent. They can help you book auditions for commercials and small roles. Try working as an extra. You need to work your way up. It isn't like on that Disney Channel show where Hollywood called her and asked her to star in a TV show.

933BTD4naa	i think that it is great that you are so devoted to music and your dream!<br>  I would recommend entering any contests or anything that your school has to offer. Continue to practice piano. Try contacting anyone in the music industry and send them a demo of your music. If you know anyone else that is a professional musician ask them for advice.
