Now I am wondering If anyone knows of any sites/store that sell them but they have like sports logos on them.   Why??? Because  I am going with about 25 people to the beach and there is a new (cute ) guy going and he is into sports(as am i).  Or if anyone could find some that are football colors. My fav teams are Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Titans, Tennesse Vols, Greenbay Packers, . Thanks so much!

20090223112737AAVW8L2	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can I wear high heels and mini skirts...?	High stilletoe heels have been hot for about a couple of years now. I love wearing them (usually 4 to 5 inch with no platform) with almost everything. Is it cool to wear them with mini skirts? I'm a bit worried comming of as really slutty. It's worse cause I'm pretty tall (5"11') and really thin (135lbs). But the thing is my legs look so sexy in mini skirts and stilletoes? help?      FYI...I like to be bare when wearing mini skirts and maybe sometimes black stockings in the winter time. I think I have the model physique but love showing off my legs. My skirts in question sit about at most about 2 inches below my crotch and I really want to pair them with my 5.5 inch stilletoes.  I wear a size 8 sometime size 9 shoe. My feet's very long and not very wide, making really high heels easy for me to wear.  5'11" is not that uncommon in europe. I stand about 6'3" in my highest heels and am still consider average or below average among runway models. I have 38" inseams but wish my legs were as long as those super models.

20090223114118AAsUUCt	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I go about achieving this hairstyle (pic inside)?	Would I be able to duplicate this look if I don't have short hair? I have thick, abundant, medium-length, 3a (with some 3b mixed in), curly hair that's a few inches past my shoulders. There is this certain style that I fell in love with while looking up hairstyle pictures online. I know a curling iron wouldn't work, because I don't think the curling iron would give me the amount of body and volume that this look requires. So, I was thinking that a wet set with 1?"-diameter magnetic rollers might work in achieving this look? What do you guys think? What would you suggest?         Here is the picture:          http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e237/m...          Thanks in advance.

20090223115356AAhtWHS	Beauty & Style;Makeup	My fiance's 10 year old niece keeps trying to use my makeup despite me saying no?	I've tried talking to her mum about it but she keeps saying she's going to use makeup at some point so she might as well start now. It annoys me that her mum isn't doing anything because I barely have any makeup as my complexion is really clear, I just have it for confidence as I have a scar down the side of my face. I've been told I'm making a big deal out of nothing. But she doesn't respect my space in house (the niece and her mum live with us in our house for nothing) or in my studio.             The thing is it's in my dresser drawer which means she has to go into my bedroom and go through my dresser drawer because it's in the back of the same drawer with my underwear in it and there is some concealer and foundation in my handbag which she has also used      Any ideas how I can stop her destroying my makeup?

20090223120955AA85K19	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is six weeks to often to relax your hair?	I started going to a new hair dresser about 6 to 8 weeks ago and he used a sensitive scalp Designers Essentials on my hair and it was bullet straight.  It has been about 6 weeks and he now says that it is time for another relaxer and my hair is still very straight in my opinion.  I do not want to insult his professional opinion because it is so hard to find a good hair dresser in this area.  Because of my old hair dresser, I had to cut a good bit of my hair because she was not taking care of it and the relaxer that she was using was just to strong (Revlon Realistic) and the damage that she caused couldn't be fixed with just my at home maintenance.  Needless to say, my hair is in much better condition, but my hair has never stayed straight this long with a relaxer and I do not want any more mishaps with  my hair.  What should I do?

I feel that my taste in makeup is too much for a professional office setting (secretary position). How can I keep my taste in makeup without looking too made up?      I normally wear a fair amount of black eyeliner on my bottom lids. The so-called "cat eye", but without dark lids. As eyeshadow color, I use Baked Sands by Physician's Formula. I have black mascara that doesn't do anything fancy (I already have thick long lashes). Sometimes I apply liquid liner on the top lids as well.      The eye makeup brings attention to my eyes, and away from the fact that I have a very round face. I use cover up, not foundation. I don't use colored lipstick/gloss. I don't use blush.

20090223115358AArF09n	Beauty & Style;Hair	I'd like to donate my hair, but...?	I am 32 weeks preg and have always had long hair.  However, with all these vitamins, my hair has grown much faster than usual!  It occurred to me that it would be really cool to donate it once it's long enough.  I know about Locks of Love, but I also know that they do sell portions of the hair they receive to offset their manufacturing costs.  (It says so on their website.)  I want to donate my hair to a place that will NOT sell it (as I am rather attached to it and will probably be emotional about this.)  I also want to make sure that the wigs made go only to people who need them for medical reasons.  I don't want to donate to a place that turns out to be a scam either.  I have done some preliminary research on this and keep hitting what looks like junk sites.  Does anyone who has done this know of legitimate places to donate (besides LOL)?  I thought I might try to benefit from someone else's knowledge before I try to slog through all the Google results!  ;)  Thanks!

I'm fine with that because I've had it done before, but I have a couple questions.      How should I prepare my hair for a stripping?      And      Should I touch up my roots with the dark colour I used before the stripping so that the colour is even for a strip? Does it make a difference? Right now my auburn roots are showing about two inches (which looks ridiculous paired with the dark, thank you hats and ponytails).      I probably won't be getting the new 'do until April, so I'm just asking some things in advance.

20090223110357AAkmDfb	Beauty & Style;Hair	Guy, 20 - What haircut should i get?	i'm a 20 year old guy who rarely has much done to his hair. frankly, it's getting much to long to keep presentable. because i have so little experience with trips to the hairdressers, i don't know what to ask for. i have an oval shaped full face, and wear quite thick black rimmed glasses. at the moment, my hair/bangs are just over ear length, and i straighten it regularly as it's the only thing i can do with it that looks half decent, otherwise my hair is usually wavy/loose curls.   i don't mind losing the length, as long, as my girlfriend puts it, she can still run her fingers through it. she doesn't want me to get it cut - tough.   any professional advice, pictures or info would be much appreciated :)

20090223120557AAgYUFN	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Are teen bra sizes the same as regular bra sizes?	Okay, so I have always been very small chested compared to everyone I've seen my age (17), and girls younger, too. The other day I was in a store and I picked out a few teen bras to try on - 70A (I think that's 32A), 75A (34A) and 70B. I was sure that they would be kind of big on me, or at least the 70B one, but that one actually fit fine and was even a bit small/tight. That doesn't really make sense to me, because I really am small-chested - when I tried measuring myself at home and checking online, most of the results were either 32AA or 30A. So, it doesn't really make sense to me that I can suddenly be a B cup or maybe even a C. Is it just that the cup sizes on teen bras are smaller than on regular ones? So like, maybe a 70/32B would actually be a 32A? Though that still doesn't make sense to me, because it seems to me that a 70C would fit me too (I didn't try it on, though) so even if it is actually a 32B, that's still a lot bigger than what it seems like I have.      Also, another question - about how much should I be paying for a decent but not too expensive bra? The ones I saw there were about 17.5 dollars, and my mom thought it was a lot to pay for them.      Thanks for any help.

One such "site" said "I don't need to know the dimensions of your ***", and other muck.  Correct me if I am wrong but tight jeans do the same don't they?  Yet a whole lot of people are wearing those.      Are these haters just jealous of those that can pull the look off or something?  Anyone like wearing leggings?      I personally love them and do my best to present a good image with them.  It's a nice break from the ubiquitous blue jeans.

I am 34 and even though I shop at nice places I am incapable of putting decent clothes together in a respectable manner.

Now I know what will happen if I go out in public dressed weird - people will look at me funny. But past that, is there any harm that will come of this? I get good service in stores and I don't think it's an actual crime to have bad taste is it? Is it okay if I just stop trying to dress well? It's exhausting.

I'm still a teenager and I have no money to fix them. But these things that I can't get are eating at me. My mom never gives me money. And I don't feel like sharing all of this with her, she won't understand.      I feel like everybody is looking at me when I have like 3 pimples on my face, when i'm sure nobody even notices. And even knowing that, it still drives me crazy because I know it's there.      I used to be chubby. Then I got really skinny. Now i'm average. I want to be super skinny again, but idk how. I never did anything to get skinny, it was just a side effect from taking adderall daily. But now i'm getting immune to it and it's not making me lose weight anymore.      I'm so fed up with this weight thing, i've been seriously thinking about bulemia because I know I couldn't be anorexic.

20090223125434AAiB54S	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I need piercing advice from someone extremely knowledgeable with piercings.?	First off I would like to stress a couple things; here's some background on my piercing knowledge.      I have had over ten facial piercings; I know nearly everything there is to know about piercings, aftercare, and whatnot.      If you don't know a lot about piercings, please don't waste your time answering. I also don't really care about your opinions, if you don't like them.      This is something I haven't yet experienced. I figured I'd see what people here on the internet had to say, because it's hard to find good advice in these situations.      I got a medusa piercing on New Year's day, so it's a couple months old now. Today I decided I didn't want it anymore and I removed it, so I don't plan on ever putting it back in. Although, now, if I stretch my lip the wrong way, I get a bubble that comes out of the hole (on the inside). It almost looks like the inside of my lip is oozing out; that would be the best way to describe it.      I've had this before with my old snakebites; thought not quite as bad. After the membrane healed itself it went away. I am slightly concerned, although not enough to go to a doctor because I know I'm not going to die.      I was just wondering - any advice/suggestions? How do you think it will heal, and is there anything I could be doing/taking to speed up the process (ie. sea salt, vitamin E, aspirin, etc)?      Thanks in advance.

Anyway, I was wearing some laguna skinny jeans from hollisterr that I had tried on in the store and felt pretty good. I like my jeans tight all the way down the legs, since I usually pair them with some uggs. Anyway, I noticed that during the day, they kept sliding down. I didn't get it. The upper legs: tight, the calfs: tight tucked into the uggs, but they seriously felt like they were sliding down. When I tried to pull them up with both hands and fingers pinching the waist, they wouldn't come up!!! why wouldn't they come up? Is it the tiny crotch of the jeans?
