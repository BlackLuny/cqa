Je suis un jeune futur père (1ère grossesse) et j'ai quelques questions par rapport à notre première echo; pouvez vous m'aider...      Nous avons fait une première échographie de datation il y a 15 jours (environ 10 SA) et notre première échographie de grossesse aujourd'hui (12 SA).      La première écho nous a bien rassurée; mais en voyant l'écho d'aujourd'hui, j'ai eu quelques doutes... en effet on voyait bien sa tête; je ne sais pas si l'échographie était très poussée (zoom) mais cette fois si, on voyait bien sa machoire (squelette) mais son visage était moins "naturel" que lors de la première écho (les battements cardiaques étaient bon, et l'échographie ne paraissait pas inquiète...)      Pouvez vous me dire ce que vous en pensez?, est ce normal?      2nd petite question: est ce normal que le f?tus bouge moins d'une écho à l'autre? (aujourd'hui il bougeait, mais moins que lors de la première écho... (l'échographie l'a "secoué" un peu pour qu'il se mette dans une bonne position pour le mesurer))      dernière question (et ensuite j'arrête, promis!!!): La clarté nucale (1 mm) semblait normale et le tube neural était bien visualisé, est ce qu'on peut dire que le risque de spina bivina est en grande partie écarté (ou est ce qu'il s'agit d'autre chose)?      merci beaucoup par avance pour toutes vos petites réponses et votre expérience...

Also, for the past couple of weeks, I have been have severe cramps like my period is coming on but yet it never showed.       Plus, the last period I had, which was on Valentine's Day, wasn't normal. I spotted for about 30 minutes and it went off. I am also kind of bloated; I have all the period symptoms and signs but no period. Does this mean I'm pregnant?       Oh, I heard that sometimes the father knows before the mother does. And for the last couple of weeks, my boyfriend has been asking me if I'm pregnant. He says " I look it" whatever that means.

So i decided it's best to finish breastfeeding before i go, to get her used to formula (shes fussy about whole milk) while i'm away.  I stopped nursing gradually, cutting 4 times to 2, then twice a day to only bed time, then now i cut out her bed time breastfeed.        my question is this:  when you stopped nursing, were your bras really tight? when will the boobs shrink?  do i do anything or just leave my boobs alone and they'll go back on their own?  I'm not painfully engorged, just a bit bigger than normal, little bit full.      i'm worried about blocked ducts too.      i heard theres pills to dry up milk, but i dont want to take anything.      Any advice?  Thanks.

We are so happy she's here!  :)  Because I have two other girls (ages 4.5 and 20 months), I really want to try "wearing" Lainey since I am so busy it is hard to hold her without constantly having to put her down to assist the other kids (mainly the 20 month old).  I was wondering if anyone could tell me the best "baby wearing" product.  I bought a sling in the past (can't remember the brand) but found it uncomfortable and my daughter did not like it at all.  It was extremely snug, and both sides came up around her head so she was sunk in completely.  Does anyone have a product they absolutely love and could recommend? I would really appreciate your ideas.  Thanks in advance!

Hello there, and thanks for reading my question.      I am seven months pregnant and I'm trying to buy a nursing bra for use after the baby is born.      I am reading that during pregnancy, most women's band size goes up, and then goes back down after the birth - is that true?  I have also read that after the baby descends in the ninth month of gestation, band size can also go down - did anyone here find that to be true?      I started at a 32 band size, and I'm now at a 34 or 36, so I'm confused as to which band size to get in my nursing bra.  Usually if the band is too wide, the bra rides all the way up my shoulder blade.      Thanks for any help or tips you can give me.

I usually stay up during his first 2 to 3 hours of sleeping.  I go to bed when he wakes for his first feed.  That is the last time I change his diaper.  WHen I wake up to feed him after that it's usually just long enough to latch him on and maybe look at the clock.  Most mornings I wak eup and pick him up to see that his diaper has leaked and there is a wet spo ton my bed.  he never poops at night though.  I keep saying that I will get up during one of his MANY night feedings and change him but I never do!  Mostly because Im just so tired but also because i know if I get him up, undress him, and chang ehis diaper that he will wake up and be up for a few hours (it's happened the few times I did).  does that make me an asshole?  he doesn't seem to notice that he's wet.....haha

At my doctors appointment yesterday, they were asking me all these questions about the delivery, if I will be breastfeeding and if I want to be sterilized or what BC I wanted after the baby was born. I hadn't thought much on it I am only 8 1/2 weeks pregnant.       This will be my 3rd pregnancy. I have 2 beautiful babies with my ex husband and this baby is my fiances. He is really pushing me into getting my tubes tied. He said that it would be easier for me to get sterilized because I will already be in surgery with my c-section and that 3 children is enough. I know that I probably won't want any more children, but the thought of being sterilized makes me cringe. There are so many other ways to prevent pregnancy. SO my questions are should I get my tubes tied? Would you? And are there any side effects of getting it done?

20090226115940AAu7XU7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Please help me, i think i may be bulimic and have started cutting(read details)?	Would This Be Bulimia? Becuase i heard for bulimia you have to binge before you purge, well heres the details,   i was sexually assualted february of last year and it really affected me, my friends where all there for me so i was sort of feeling better but then someone said that i was lying about it so it spread round the whole schoola nd they all fell out with me so i used to sit in the toilets at lunch and break i skipped certain classes becuase i knew it would be really bad in them, so my school work started to fail, then this girl who is really eman said omg look how fat she is and started laughing so then i had just had my lunch and i just ran to the toilet and purged, i felt really dizzy but i thought maybe it would help so i kept doing it, i skip breakfast and lunch and when i eat tea infront of my parents after i go to the toilet and purge. that has been going on for about 5 months now.   Then about a month ago i started to finally hang about with a couple of people but then a big group of girls came and started shouting at me that i should just die etc, so when i went home istarted to cut myself on my leg, and now about 3-4 times a week i cut my leg, sometimes i start new cuts or sometimes i cut open the ones i have already cut.   now someones starting to notice the scars in PE and im really worried and have no idea what to do, i ven tried to commit suicide once when the teacher wanted a meeting with me the next day with social services becuase there was concern for school work so i just took loads of paracetamol and my mum saw me on the floor and shouted at me and said i had to go to school, but i didnt take enough to kill myself, the social services said nothing when i went to the meeting.   I really dont know what to do.

20090226115521AAsDBXJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	5 month old sleeping habits?  Please help!?	My baby is now 5 months old. She has some good nights of sleep and some bad nights, but lately it seems like bad nights. She is breastfed. I put her to bed around 7 to 7:30 and she is usually up every few hours to eat and sometimes not to eat, just to be rocked to bed. She was sleeping through the night or just waking up once to eat for about 2 months, but the last month she has been waking up every few hours.      I know if she is going through a growing spurt or is teething that could affect her sleep, but I do not think either would last this long, and if she were teething, she would be uncomfortable when she wakes up, and she is not, she just wants to play or eat.      I have tried putting her to bed later, feeding her more at night and during the day and giving her less naps, but nothing seems to work. What do you think i can do? I hate to let her cry it out, but do you think that is my only choice? Thanks for the advice

Also, I went to my doctor on the 19th and I had developed a cyst on my ovary called a corpus luthum cyst. This cyst attaches to the uterus where the egg is suppose to attach and produces progesterone until the uterus builds up enough to produce it's own. Could I be pregnant? When should I test? I tested about three days ago and it was negative. Should I wait until the first day of a missed period?      Thanks for the help and answers!

I grew up on these stories and they are so calm and beautiful, I just can't imagine my child with anything else. The colors are so warm and inviting, I just love everything about it.      The only problem is that I cannot find any Beatrix Potter nursery items anywhere! I can find a "Baby Picasso" theme but no "Beatrix Potter"? I don't understand. I looked on Ebay but all I can find are scattered items here and there and nothing matches and I can't find anything online!      BTW--I highly dislike the Walmart version. This is the ONLY set I can find. It's very yellow and doesn't do any kind of justice to the color and artwork in her books.      Someone please help--I'm going to cry!!! There must be SOMEONE that knows where I can find this stuff!
20081022195631AAGJxDn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much does your SO/Husband ACTUALLY take care of the baby?	Question is specifically what it says. How much/often does your SO/Husband take care of your baby? Do they do diaper duty or no (my fiance avoids it like the plague!)?      This is why I ask:   Today, I felt sick to my stomach when I woke up at 5:30am to give Cameron a bottle. So sick, that I had to have my fiance (who was getting up for work) finish giving him a bottle and change his diaper because I wound up in the bathroom throwing up. He offered to stay home from work to take care of the baby (he makes salary so it didnt affect his pay, they didnt dock anything). It made me feel great that he offered to help.      He did great- until that is when I went to school. Regardless of being sick I had to go to class because I'm almost to that degree! The only thing I needed to instruct him on was how to make a bottle because we add rice to it, so he didn't know how much rice to add.      But then I went to school for 3 hours. And that entire 3 hours- he passed the baby off to his mom and slept. I was so pissed. He said it was to give his mom QT time with the baby (even tho she watches him 2 times a week for several hours). But this happens every time the two of them are supposed to have alone time.      I'm beginning to think, that he is too nervous having the baby by himself so he likes to have the backup of his mother. Although some days (sunday football day) it is him, his brother and then my son and the 3 of them hang out all day and he does just fine. I'm stumped!

We don't want to use daycare for the first few months because my husband will be writing as well, so we can stagger times we're home.  How did you working moms handle everything without going insane?

20081022044433AAiCtKE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	1st birthday party for little girl- Silly question ?	So, my daughter is turning one this Saturday and we're having a party of course. I was planning on just wearing cute little pants and a shirt on her because I think a dress would be too cold for the end of October plus she'll be able to move around better in pants. When I told this to her Grandmother and some other people they were all shocked, almost appalled that I wasn't wearing  a dress on her. Now I'm still wearing the pants on her because I don't really care but I was just wondering that if you went to a little girls party and she wasn't wearing a dress would "appalled"?

20090226110938AAdrGwe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I am a stay at home mom.  What activities can I do with my toddlers ages 3 and almost 2?	I have been a stay at home mom since my oldest was born.  I believe it is my calling, although I find myself questioning if my kids would be better off in daycare.  I know for bonding purposes the kids are far better off with me.  However I am pretty shy and newer to the town I live in, so I havent really made friends.  So my kids are pretty much stuck with me all day with no other kids to play with.  I find myself yelling a lot and getting frustrated with my kids.  My kids are extremely smart for their age.  My 3 year old boy is VERY smart and VERY active.  He loves to play educational pc games. Mainly I just want to know what other SAHM do during the day to keep their young kids stimulated.  My kids dont seem to want to play by themselves, even though I feel like I dont play with them enough.  The days get long in the winter and we rarely go outside since its cold.  I feel my kids are bored and I cant seem to work up enough energy to play with them more.  How much "me and kids play time" should I be giving during a 12 hour day?  Besides electronics/tv/pc how do I keep my kids entertained without feeling guilty about not physically playing with them?

20081106074134AA0wxZ3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Feeding my 3 month old?	My daughter's pediatrician confuses me. I have done my own research and reading online and in parenting magazines but her doctor tells me differently. When I quit producing breast milk, I supplemented with Similac Advanced. It made Cailynn very fussy and EXTREMELY constipated. I called her doctor because she hadn't pooped for 3+ days and they told me to give her apple juice mixed with water... keep in mind that she was only 3 WEEKS old at this time. I even told them that it didn't sound right ... I had never ever heard of anyone giving such a small baby juice. But I did as I was told and it immediately cleared her out and you could tell it hurt her belly. Next time when she got constipated I called again ... same thing "give her juice". I used MY better judgment as a mom and just switched her formula instead of giving juice. Whattayaknow... it worked.      My friend has a baby of the same age and her doctor said to go ahead and feed her child rice cereal with formula starting at 3 months of age. My pediatrician didn't tell me that when we got her shots at 2 months so I called and asked. He told me to go ahead and start her on the cereal. Nothing more was told to me. So being a first time mom, I had no idea what to do. I actually only started her on it yesterday. I didn't do the recommended amount on the box because that seemed too much to me. I gave her a 5 ounce bottle and put the tinniest pinch of cereal in there. Now I'm reading all of these articles on when to start your child on rice cereal and I'm getting confused. Articles say anywhere from 3-6 months. Some say only after 6 months, some say 3 months is ok to start.      What do I do? Do I feed it to her? Do I stop feeding it to her? Do I tell her doctor to shove off? Ah... I'm confused. Who am I supposed to trust as a new mom if my pediatrician is even telling me conflicting opinions?

20081105105838AApe620	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ok to mix formulas? and Do I need to?	My daughter is 7weeks old and I have her on an "easy digest" formula (Enfamil gentle ease/Similac sensitive) She has a bit of colic but now she doesn't seem to be satisfied (full) after eating. She will eat until she's too full and she is still hungry~ I think it's because the sensitive is not filling because of it's "break down", so I wanted to switch to a more hearty formula (regular or soy) so she doesn't have to be stuffed to be "full"! Should I switch??? Before just switching her from one formula to the next I wanted to ween her by mixing her current formula with the next one. Has anyone done this??? and Is it ok to do???

20081001184614AAI1SMn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you think about the doctors deciding if you she be a male or female if you were born with both sexes?	I believe that they are special people who deserve the right and freedom to live as they are.  I think I'll call them "shem" she for girl and M for male.  What I mean by third human species is a person who part male and part female.  Doctors always try to decide sex they should be and when they grow up they are very disappointed in the decision their parents and the doctors agree upon.  I think the doctors should change what God has created.  I think they should grow up and live how they feel comfortable living; as a man or as a woman.  But that their decision to make and not their parents or doctor without their consent.

20081019220140AAciUu7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Please I need advice! My baby ate too much and is vomiting?	My 4 mopnth old daughter was fed a few hours ago. She took the breast but was still crying so I thought I had a lack of milk (me and my Dr discussed this, I need to pump more) and so gave her bottle- 3 oz- and burped her and she was perfectly happy (playing, etc.). She then fell asleep about an hour later and I layed her in her crib and she slept until....      I heard a noise on the monitor so went in & she seemed fine until I closed the door and she started coughing. (She sleeps on her stomach because she rolls onto it.) I ran in and saw her lifting her head and just vomit was pouring out of her mouth. I quickly picked her up and she continued to vomit, not breathing, until finally it stopped and she was breathing normally. She seemed kind of out of it because it's her bed time and she was still tired (awakened from the vomit, I guess). Anyway, I kept holding her to help her sleep and feel better and then it felt like her stomach was seizing (like how a stomach kind of clenches up to allow a person to vomit) and she spit up some more (she did this twice). Anyway, I'm very freaked out and I have no idea what to do, any suggestions?? Please help I'm freaking out.      She fell back asleep now and I layed her down but I'm worried...
20081019224035AA74WAv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is my one month old always hungry. he is eating 4oz already! what should i do?	I am feeding my one month old 4 oz every 31/2 - 4 hours and a lot of the time i have to give him another oz or more before he's satisfied. He's was eating 4 oz per feeding pretty much since he was 1-2 weeks old. My pedeatrician said to give him 4 oz if he really wants it but usualy he wants MORE so I started giving him an extra 1-2 oz when he really gets mad. Now he's one month and the 4-5 oz are just not satisfing him at all most of the time. If I give him anymore he'll be up to 6-7 oz already!  I'm really afraid to overfeed him but I don't want him to go hungry. what should I do??

20081023002526AA4FxqJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Thoughts on nap time?	I have a 19 week old daughter and she is the best child in the world and I love her more than I can say...but I guess you all know what that feels like:)   She goes to bed in the evening about 6.15pm after a bath and 8oz bottle, which she drains. She settles herself to sleep and is usually out 5 min later. I then go in about 10.30pm, do her nappy and top her up with a bottle-mind you, top up is not really true as she has another 8oz bottle. She will sleep through until 6am, which is great but it would be nice if she slept longer but hey, I guess I am lucky with her sleeping through and being tired is just part of the deal.      Enough babbling, here is my question:   she will have a short nap in the morning about 8.30am and then we struggle to nap during the day. I would like her to have a long nap over lunchtime but she will only sleep for 30min and then another 30 min, if you get my drift. I think with a little perseverance I could get her to sleep but how fair is it? We are out and about quite a lot and I need her to fit in with that. I can''t really expect her to sleep in her cot when we are at home but not when we are out. What are your thoughts? What are your nap routines if you have any? Should I change my life to be home for every nap time? But when would I get anything done like shopping or seeing friends? Or even go for a walk when she sleeps in the pushchair? I hope I have made my questions clear...it is all a bit confusing...Thank you

20081024021918AA7GfgN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does anyone else feel like NZ has become a haven for the breastfeeding Nazi's?	Don't get me wrong...I breastfed for 4.5 months with my first-born - all through intense pain (breastfeeding was a toe-curling excercise which often had me in tears ...no mastitis or any infection - just plain hideous).  I will NOT put myself through that again with my 2nd (due 16 December)...but I will try.      What I'm concerned about is that I see a lot of mum's persisting much longer than I did, or persisting to breastfed through even worse situations than mine, and made to feel guilty if they decide to go to formula.  Organisations such as La Leche League, The Parents Centre, et al are all so pro-breast that they refuse to even provide information on the alternatives...leaving a lot of mum's in the dark about how to provide the alternative safely.  In addition, it seems to have created a 'community' of very judgemental people who look sideways or even COMMENT when they see you bottle-feeding!      Any comments?

My 8 month old (actually he is closer to 9 months) is still not sleeping thru the night. He is up every three hours, almost to the minute. That is on a "good night" - sometimes he is up more often then that.      Most nights I nurse his back to sleep as it is easiest and I want to go back to sleep too.       I cannot and will not do the CIO method....but I need to do something soon. He is over 20 lbs so I know he doesnt need to be eating thru the night. He eats about 4 jars of food a day plus finger foods. He has 2 naps a day usually lasting an hour to an hour and a half.      Any advice?       Thanks..

Not going to well if you ask me he still has a lot of growing up to do and in my eyes thinks he did nothing wrong and just wants to start from clean. That so ticked me off 1 cause i dont trust him at all he up and leaves me and the baby when i need him the most! What kind of dad, man, human with a heart can do that? Then 2 months before i deliver he got struck by god and saw the light? Something just isnt added up in my mind but i could be over reading everything.      Anyway what i need help on is this. I want to name my baby girl Natalia Renee Grace (my last name) or chloe (i havent thought that one out lol) Anyway He says it sounds like a striper and wants to name her Diamond April (his last name). Natalia or Diamond what sounds more like a striper to you? It just seems so arrogant to me to pop back in and oh i hate your name lets use mine.      Someone tell me what im feeling is right and that im not just being dramamitic and pregnant and hormonal all the time. Or if I am being dramatic tell me that too let me know if im right or out of line in what im feeling please. But i think he lost his chance for her to have his last name when he walked out.   What it comes down to is should i use my name i like or try to come up with something with both?

20090226113404AAfO0zg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Alright I'm going to lay all of this out in detail!?	First off I'm 24 years old. My normal period cycle i would say is 35-42 days depending. The past few months right at about 35 days. My last period was at the end of January (don't remember the days exactly bc somehow my digital calendar got erased) I do however remember that it said i was due again for my period March 3rd or 4th and that my fertile times were Feb. 9-14th.     Now that you know the background information here is a little more to aid in the obvious question. My nippes have been super sore for a little over a week a now.It's uncommon for me to have sore nipples or sore breasts at all before a period. They tingle and feel like they've been pinched. I can only lay certain ways, have to be really careful when changing, etc. Not to mention I don't let my fiance touch them lately unless he's EXTREMELY gentle. They feel heavy and swolen to me.    I don't get cramps until right before my period and even that is rare. Lately I've been experiencing slight little pains or twitches in my lower abdomen, but only at night time when I'm laying down. (or maybe that's when i seem to notice since the hustle and bustle of the day has slowed down)       The rest of the symptoms are as follows:   I'm tired as ever! I could sleep till 1pm everyday and well lately I have been.   I have a little bit of trouble actually going to sleep at night but once I am asleep I'm like a rock.   I pee more than I really care to go to the bathroom (or maybe it's that i notice more)   I'm bloated and a little gassy. My pants wont even really fit right.    My fiance has said that my food cravings are strange and well I don't know if I agree. I'm craving anything with peanut butter!!! and the occasional salt and vinager potato chip.    I find that when I stand up I'm slightly spacey and light headed. Kind of scatterbrained a lot lately.    Heartburn when I eat just about anything.   Also, this is kinda weird but I'm cold and hot non-stop. The room could be really warm and I could be covered in goosebumps and freezing cold-which by the way doesn't help the nipple situation! Or it could be freezing in a room and im quite comfortable.    I used to be able to go all day without eating bc I would get busy and my stomach never really growled. Now I find myself waking up being so hungry I almost feel sick. Then my stomach continues to growl throughout the day over and over again. Of course I'm eating though.    I'm emotional as all hell. I find myself crying for random reasons. I've always been fairly emotional but geez not to the point that I cry over spilled milk.       I think that's about it. I know there's a lot to read and I'm sorry for all of the details, but I want to make sure I don't miss anything! I know I should take a pregnancy test for the obvious reasons, but I dont want to be let down. Not to mention I'm worried that it might be too soon to take one? I'm wondering if I should wait a couple of weeks to be sure?       Please no stupid answers or answers by children. I hate it when people are disrespectful on here. I would prefer the answers be by women who have been pregnant, currently pregnant, etc.       Thanks so much for your help!!

20090226115223AAdMyAR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Contractions at 25 weeks.?	I am 25 weeks pregnant with my second baby.  For the last couple of weeks I have had some bad cramping.  Like period cramping.  At first is was only a couple times a week but last week it was almost every night.  And when they did come I would have one almost every hour on the hour.  But after about 5 they quit.  I told my dr about it at our last appointment.  She said as long as there wasn't any tightening that happened 6 times in an hour. (Which I haven't felt.)  But last night I felt the same cramping along with the tightening.  It only last maybe a minute and just the one time.  And before the cramping was only on my right side and around to my back.  But last night it was my whole belly.  I will probably call my midwife anyway.  I was just wandering if anyone else has had this experience.  I am not sure if it is the real thing or just braxton hicks.  I have heard that braxton hicks contractions don't hurt.  Whatever I had hurt so much I have to stop what I am doing.
20090226115323AAmjkAd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am 9 Week Pregnant, saw ultrasound yesterday-no baby? Have I had a miscarriage?	I have another child, so I know what I should have seen, and I kept asking the tech where the baby was, and he told me he doesnt see one. Then he told me that I could be too early. I had both ultrasounds the transvaginal too. He came back after talking to the radiologist, and told me that I had to speak to my doctor. My doctor then told me that according to the Tech I am only 5 weeks along. Which then made me think about how that was possible since I was positive in the doctors office 6 weeks ago. So today I had to go get bloodwork done after crying since yesterday, and the doctor mentioned that I might have a false pregnancy. But that we will rule it out. I am so worried-though I know it's not helping the situation.

20090226115319AALoRAp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2 year old has pneumonia?	I took my 2 year old son to the doctors today because he has a constant cough and was spitting up a little bit. He was up all night coughing and crying. The doctor listened to his chest area for a good 5 mins and said he had pneumonia in his left lung. Just a couple weeks ago he had the RSV virus and the doctor said it could lead to pneumonia so she put him on an antibiotic during that time he developed a bacterial infection in his nail and was on another antibiotics. I seems like he is always getting sick and the doctor is always throwing antibiotics at him. He will do fine while on them, I will see improvement then a couple days after ending the antibiotics he is sick again. He did go for chest x-ray and sweat test to test for cystic fibrosis and had blood work done, and all those test looked good. So what could be the problem? and is it safe for him to constantly be on an antibiotic?

I usually don't PMS until 1-2 days before I'm due.    -I had a (very tiny) bit of spotting a few days ago, but it was a very small amount, so I'm not sure it counts or not.   -I've found that I get gassy, even when eating foods that don't normally cause gas.   -I've been a bit emotional lately (I cried because the cake I was frosting got crumbs in the frosting...!)   -I took a pregnancy test yesterday, and it came back negative, but I knew it was probably too early.

He wakes up and sits up crying.       I have tried the Baby Whisperer shush pat method. It kind of works but it doesnt put him to sleep for good.      I've tried the cry it out method. He gets hysterical and starts to bash his head against the crib wall.      usually he wakes up every hour or 2 and my husband and i just need to pat his back, put in his soother and he's good for another hour or 2. but when he decides to wake he wakes and screams. Sometimes the only thing that settles him is to bring him into the bed with me. or else i lose so much sleep i can't function in the day.      please help me! i know it's cause he doesn't know how to make himself fall back asleep on his own. HOW DO I TEACH HIM THAT?      His bed routine is the same every night and he's a dream to put to naps in the day and sleeps SOLID. why is he so miserable at nights??      Thank you for your help!

20090225111341AA4qHwO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Are we the only family where the toys are considered?	community property rather than belonging to one sibling only?      out of our gazillions of stuffed animals each kid has one that is their "special animal" and the other kids have to surrender it if it's desired by the owner, but other than that, we don't designate whose stuff is whose.  If they got it for a birthday present or something it might be similar in that the birthday child gets first dibs on it for a few weeks, but pretty soon those become community property, too.  even at christmas most toys are labeled like "for the scientists" or "for the artists" or "for kids who love trains" rather than being given to one particular child.      How does it work in your family? Do you think it really matters one way or the other? I've heard people on here allege that not letting a child have his or her "own" stuff is somehow psychologically damaging, but i've got to say that none of my kids seem to be taking any damage thus far, plus we just avoid fights over who owns what....  Should any of them one day express a strong desire that something be solely their own, I suppose I'd consider it, especially if it was purchased with their own money or a present to them,. but the kids have never in almost 10 years even raised that issue (except for non-toy things like journals).

20090226121240AAplAcn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Why is everyone so quick to dislike a name...?	Why is everyone so quick to dislike a name because it is the name of a color, gemstone, etc? It seems like people are instantly critical of a name that is already the name of something.       First of all, I'm sure the person knows that if they like the name Violet, Ruby, Dakota, Dallas, or Hunter, it is technically the name of something already, so pointing it out is kind of pointless.      Second, why does it matter? If you like the sound of a name, does it really matter that it might also be a color, gemstone, or state?       Obviously there are certain words such as Puke or Scab, that bring a negative image/thought to mind for most people, and therefore should be avoided, but names like Ruby, Violet, Dakota, and Autumn are perfectly fine words in their own right so is it really that bad if someone chooses that as a name for their child?

20090226122209AAu9mYB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you start showing earlier with your 2nd, 3rd, etc pregnancyy?	This is my 3rd pregnancy. I am 8 1/2 weeks pregnant, and I can't fit into any of my clothes. I am having to wear scrub pants out cause they are the only thing comfortable, I am going to buy new clothes for the pregnancy but I am scared that I am going to keep getting bigger.       I ain't eating any more than I did before finding out that I am pregnant. But I went back to the doctor yesterday and I already have gained 2 lbs. from seeing the doctor 2 weeks ago. I look like I am 7 months pregnant. The nurse said it is normal, but have any of you experienced this? Should I go out and buy new jeans and clothes? I just don't want to waste money.
20090225110511AAVydIl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	So we know that breast milk is best....but...?	but is formula going to HURT a baby?    What is your opinion on breast and bottle feeding?       I breastfeed my 6 week old son right now and I breastfed my daughter until she was 6 mths. She was formula fed when we went out and about and breastfed at home, but exclusively breastfed until she was about 2 or 3 mths old.       I'm finding breastfeeding this time around more of a challenge. It feels like I always have a baby on my boob...and my daughter(3) always chooses when I'm feeding him to ask me for something or to make a mess or be naughty. My house is destroyed..I feel like he eats constantly. I know you shouldn't compare children but my daughter ate and slept...she was so good.    My little boy is not happy unless he is on the breast....even the pacifier doesn't help.      I'm SORTA considering doing both breast and bottle feeding.....but I feel guilty...and lazy for thinking about it....      any advice? thoughts?

20090225105915AAN61w6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parenting: a moving out question.?	okay so im 18 and i moved out on my 18th birthday. My mom was always like wait till your 18 and i can kick you out and she tried several times from the time i was 15 till an hour before i was 18! when i was 17 and told me to my face that she was going to kick me out that night so she left i called the police not on her but myself and told them that my mom told me to get out of her house. Well they told me i had to be in court with her the next day at 9am. she came home and i told her that the officer said that if she didnt come she will go to jail well she said get your a** out of my house now! so i got my shoes on and proceeded to walk down the street to the police station i found out later that she called them and said i just ran away. Well anyway that went away after the judge dismissed it because i was going to a counselor and she was supposed to go but told the judge that she refused to go with me so he dismissed it. Well later that year she decided that she was tired of being home with the kids and being a full time mommy and wanted to work. Well she did just that and left me to be the mother she left before they woke up and came home after they went to bed so i was at home raising her 2 **little girl was almost 2 and little boy was almost 1**kids by myself i was still 17. And before then she had 3 kids but the court thought she wasnt a good mother and gave them to her ex. Well we got in a fight about a week before my 18th birthday i told her i was tired of this i get no pay, no respect, they still treated me like i was a 13 year old and everything. Well i was cleaning my little sisters room and she was came in there and she was like its an hour to your birthday i want you out and she was like if I am nice enough i will let you stay but you can complain about nothing and will do as i say or i will kick you out and you have no one. Well my friend called me was like hey come move in with me we can figure everything out. So that night i packed and my friend came to pick me up that morning. Well later after she woke up and saw that i was gone she called the police they told her nothing could be done because i am 18. And so then she decided to run off and tell all my family that i ran ff with a guy which i didnt! and she was like who is gonna take care of the kids and my grandmother was like there mother. and well a few weeks later my grandmother called me and was like your mom told me to tell you to call her and so I was like okay and so i did that and she lied and was like i never said that and my grandmother doesnt lie my mother does though. And i told her i was pregnant and she was like whore and i was like excuse me i have only slept with one person since i have been 18 how does that make me a whore. And well when i changed my number i called her and she called me back and was like who is this i was like your daughter and she was like ok bye and click      my question is would you ever do this to your daughter?   and wats your opinion on this?      no rude comments and i dont thumbs down

I didn't head to the hospital bc the baby was active right after and I didn't have any bleeding or leakage.
20090226123150AAtYDdb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	For other mums with babies who are dependent on their routine?	I guess this is more to complain then anything but do other mums find that all the play groups and music groups are on during your babies nap times? My 9 month old has two naps per day the first one is around 9.30-10 am which is when all the baby groups start. I really really want to take her but if I keep her up through her morning nap she is a little nightmare. She gets so overtired she dosnt have her arvo nap! and then is very difficult and fussy at night and hard to put down for the night. Usually resulting in her waking frequently through the night to scream.    I have never known another baby as dependant on thier routine as my baby! my friends seem to just fit their babies naps around what they do during the day and so they are able to go to all the fun activities.  They encouage me to do the same but it results in an over tired grumpy baby so its just not worth it. I often feel my friends dont understand this.  Does anyone else have kides that need a routine so badly and are unable to get out to all the baby groups due to them clashing with their routines? I have heard it is normal for 9 month olds to be very routine dependant? In my situation would you miss out to keep the babies routine going smoothly or try and get them used to taking naps later?

20090226121407AAh1Eub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mums would you object to someone taking pictures of thier own baby in a public swimming pool?	My friends & I took our babies swimming today - for two of them it was their first time so my friend asked could she take in her waterproof camera & was told no - its their policy (and that of most public pools I know)      Now I understand why the "no photography" rule is there & that it is to protect children, however, I personally would not object to a group of mums who were obviously only taking pictures of their own babies.      What do you think? Do you think pools could use their discretion on this one or should there be a blanket "no photography" rule?      Thanks

My question is, is there any cream of toner what could make it go back to my nation skin tone? Because my acne is mostly gone. It's just those spots and it's driving me crazy!

20090225110124AABLohP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Came across this so i thought i'd share..morning sickness?	"During pregnancy, random smells (like food-court fries) can make you positively puke-ish. Save face by putting lemon extract or lavender oil on a handkerchief in your purse. When you're overcome by an odor, mask it by breathing into the handkerchief. Yes, it's a little Southern belle, but "I do declare" it's more ladylike than retching over a trash can at the mall."      i thought it was smart and i know i'm not the only one who gets sick from random smells.

20090226121936AA2pwuq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Your opinion on "Biblical spanking"?	I have been a parent (w/2 kids) for almost nine years and have never really been a fan of spanking.  I have done it a few times, but can say it definatley not my thing. I have found time-outs and loss of privledges to be more effective w/my kids. I recently heard a group of parents talking about "Biblical spanking" and thoguht it all sounded bizarre.  These "supporters" of B.S.  (didn't mean it that way, but that's funny...) state that time outs just don't work and are highly ineffective.  They say that B.S. is just "better" and works for all kids.  I will always stand by the fact that when it comes to raising children, it simply cannot be a "one size fits all".  PARENTS, What are your thoughts on biblical spanking?
20090225110338AARTAlW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents - what is the weirdest place that you have done 'IT' since you had kids?	I know it's difficult to find a time and place for sex after kids...       When my twin daughters were 2 we went on a road trip with our friends. We all shared this 8 bed RV and my husband and I felt weird having sex when our friends were just a metre away from us, so we didn't.       But after three weeks of this road trip we were dying for it! We stopped off at this gas station once and while my friend took the three toddlers into the store, and her husband stayed in the RV, my husband and I ran round the back of the gas station and did it up against the wall. Classy... I know!

I have four kids and ever since I had my third child I knew that I wanted five altogether.    They are ages 6, 6, 4 and 11 weeks. Do you think it's too early to start trying for another one?      Because there is a 4 year age gap between my two current youngest, I wanted there to be a really close age gap between numbers 4 and 5.       For the last month I have felt like being in bed with my husband ALL THE TIME... I have been holding back to start trying for this last baby. I have never felt like this just after having a baby!

I told them that I have the baby. They said to bring the baby. I said no. For a few reasons. My son btw is almost 4 months old.      1. There are going to be a bunch of drunks there. All I need is for one of them to come crashing into my sons stroller knocking it over and him falling to the ground and god forbid hit his head on the ground.      2. The Parade would drive him nuts with all the sirens that the firetrucks made and the loud marching bands. He hates loud noises.      She then says that I could drop the baby off with hubby or another family member. Um they are all working.       Would you have done the same? Or would you bring him? Do you feel like people who don't have children just don't understand or just aren't using their brains?

20090226123411AA9GuQ6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you have a problem if your kids interracially dated/marry?	I would normally ask white parents this question because they (maybe those in the South and in the North) usually have a problem with interracial relationships. I'm sure there other non-white parents who oppose it too, but that's a small percent.      I know it's generalization to single white parents on this, but I have dealt with hostility once. But I'm black and I personally prefer non-black women.      So parents (or Caucasian parents), would you oppose your kids if they preferred to date or marry outside their race?

And it doesnt help that my husband (and the father) works ALL DAY LONG! he has a full time and part time job and does wedding/event photography too so he is constantly busy. now when he is home he is wonderful (especially with the 2 year old, so she doesnt feel left out). i just feel that there is something i'm doing wrong. please, stay at home moms, i need advice on how to be really involved with both my children (and also keep the house in order). i do plan on going back to work (i will work at my childrens daycare) but that not for apx 2 months! also, i dont have a car so i cant drive anywhere. any advice is greatly appreciated.

Has anyone ever felt that being a mom was what they wanted to do...like i know i may be young but as of right now I really enjoy just being a mom. My husband works and supports us and we pay all the bills and everything just fine we arent in any real need for another income.

20090226122618AAys51U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Unplanned pregnancy in this ecomony? Panicked.?	I just found out I'm pregnant, and i'm terrified. I'm 20, my ex boyfriend is 21, we both have another year of college left. We broke up after a 10 month relationship but have continued seeing each other, until we finally ended it this month. Ironically, now I'm pregnant. We had good reasons for breaking up but I wouldn't mind giving it another shot, and I think he'd be a good dad. He has a semi decent job, I work like 10 hours a week (unable to work more) and I only make $7.25 an hour. Both of us have parents who we hope would support us, but we're not sure. In this economy, with the terrible housing market and unemployment rate being so high, how would you deal with this? We are both terrified out of our minds, and he thinks abortion is the best choice but I keep wavering. I can't imagine having a child but I also can't imagine having an abortion either. But if we kept it, we wouldn't know where to live, how to finish school; we both live off of our parents and neither one of us really know how to be adults.      What would you do?

I went back to the Dr. yesterday for my 6 week check-up and got the o.k. to go back to work, however because of the economy my I've been told by several of my coworkers that my boss isn't planning on giving me my hours back. I worked in a restaurant for a year and a half, with the same hours, up untill 1 day before I gave birth. They hired another waitress 1 week before I left to help fill in my hours while I was gone. Isn't there laws to protect people from this type of thing? I'm a single mother and my income is needed. If she dosen't give me my hours back what options do I have? I live in a small town and have no car, so I really need my job. Please any help would be appreciated.

20090226123235AAsmj76	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Need help Potty Training?	I feel my 21 month old daughter is ready to potty train. (Please no comments on her not being old enough - every child is different and I know my daughter and what is best for her)      She tells me she has to potty, but it is right after she just wet her diaper.  I still take her and let her sit on the potty as long as she wants, and we talk about going pee pee on the potty.        I have tried to keep track of how often she pees and take her at those intervals but it seems she holds her pee in while she is on the potty and then pees in her diaper as soon as it is on.  I'm sure it's because that is what she is used to and comfortable with.        She seems to understand the connection.  When she has peed without a diaper on she tells me she is peeing.  She loves to fill her baby doll with a bottle of water and put her on the potty to pee.      There is also an issue of differing styles of potty training in my house.        I would like to allow her to wear nothing or wear panties so she can feel the mess and have an immediate connection with the process.  I have a steam cleaner and can clean my carpet and couch whenever I want.        My husband wants her to always be in a diaper.  He wanted to get her pullups, but the last time we bought her diapers I showed him how expensive they are and he agreed we can't afford it.      I have been buying Parents Choice diapers.  They are cheap and my daughter has begun to recognize the difference between the comfort of a dry diaper and the moisture of a wet diaper.  I think that is why she has been telling me that she has to go potty after she pees, she knows she'll get a dry diaper.      Anybody experience similair issues and have any suggestions?

20090225111738AAi6ryw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Feeling bad about not breastfeeding?	I have always had trouble breastfeeding my kids however this time has been very difficult.  My son latched on right away and was a pro from the start.  My daughter was in the NICU for a week and I pumped milk for her. My problem is that after two weeks it got to be very difficult.  I was spending all my time feeding him and no time with her. Also our house was pretty busy with my other children's friends and people stopping by and the way our house is set up there is not a lot of private space to pump and at the time I could not go up and down stairs (to use our bedroom) to pump.  So in short I kind of gave up, but now I am feeling so bad about not breastfeeding and pumping.  Everyone keeps telling me I shouldn't feel bad - but I do.  I feel like I am failing my kids and that I should have tried harder.  Has anyone else ever felt like this? and if so, what did you do to try to get over this feeling?        Note: My twins are only 4 weeks old, do you think part of this feeling could be the hormones?

I usually babysit her when my parents go away but she has been challenging my authority for a while and now i can't control her. I can't restrain her because she kicks and hits and even pushes me away. I have discovered that this girl who's almost half my weight is now stronger than me. And i can't just use no contact and talk to her nicely because she will walk over me, if i stand in her way to stop her going somewhere she can pick me up off the floor and slam me flat on my butt, even when i struggle. How do i deal with her? Does it happen to anyone else? She's not supposed to be stronger than me! Especially when i thought i was a strong girl!

I get along great with her, but when she's with me and him she's always watching our hands and if we kiss in front of her she always looks at his genital area. She barges into the bedroom to use the restroom but she like side eyes to see what were doing.

20090226124951AAlRA7G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Would it be better to give a baby up for adoption or keep it?	I am 9 weeks pregnant. I just want to know if you think it would be best if I gave my baby up for adoption or if I kept it. The circumstances are such as this. 1. the dad is m.i.a. 2. I don't make a lot of money, but in order to make enough to have a house and everything necessary to raise a child, I would have to work a lot and therefore leave the baby with a sitter a lot. 3. The only babysitter I have is my mother who drinks (not usually while she's babysitting) and she has a temper problem (screaming at my child). Of course one day I want to marry the right man who loves me and loves my baby. I know down the road I am going to wish that I had it, but for right now I almost feel that it's better that it's not with me because the first three to five years of it's life probably won't be the best a child could possibly have. However, it will be loved more than anyone could ever imagine, not starve, have a roof over it's head and clothes on it's body.

So we always ask funny stories about your kids, but I want to know about humorous stories from right BEFORE you became parents (AKA: Funny pregnancy stories)?      Mine...oh there are so many, but the one that comes to mind is what I affectionately call The Worlds Longest Toilet Story:      When I was about 38 weeks into my pregnancy I woke up in the middle of the night for my nightly 2 am stumble to the bathroom, once there I realized something quite alarming: my right arm was completely numb from about the elbow down. I must have been sleeping on it in a funny position because it was still as asleep as I was desperately hoping to be. Because we had guests over, I had slept in actual pj's so I had a heck of a time getting them down with my left hand. Once I had done my business, was faced with the difficult task of figure out how I was going to get some toilet paper from the roll hanging at hip level on my right. At this point I'm now fully awake, sitting on the toilet close to tears because I can't reach the toilet paper with my left hand over my enormous penthouse suite of a stomach (aka: the womb with a view)! My right arm was still very much useless so I just whacked the roll with my limp wrist and managed to get a large mass of it onto my right arm so that I could reach it with left and tore off what I needed to clean myself with. Finally finished, I hiked my pj's up and lumbered back to bed, just in time for the pins & needles feeling to come to my lower arm...ugh!         Okay, what's with Y!A today? Are they not getting enough questions in a *certain* category?!      Suggested Category:   #  Society & Culture > Cultures & Groups > Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered

Last week we found out we're having a baby girl, im currently 21 weeks pregnant and im so confused on what to call her. Before we found out she was a girl we'd agreed on Olivia but now we want to have a look at a few other names.       I know we'll probably end up waiting until she's born in july to see her and decide for sure on her name.      Her surname will be Lewis, and we've already decided her middle name is going to be Kate after my great-grandmother.       at the moment we are looking at:      Olivia Kate Lewis   Ella Kate Lewis   Ava Kate Lewis   Amelie Kate Lewis      as you can see i quite like girly, pretty names, although i do like names with an older feel to them, as well as newer names, but nothing too wild. My name is Aimee, and ive spent years of telling people how to spell it, getting all sorts of spellings along the way. I dont want her to have to go through having a hard spelt name or unheard of name that everyone will mis-spell      What do you think for the same i have suggested?   do you have any other ideas?   thanks in advance x

Her hair is light brown and about 4 or 5 inches past her shoulders. But always in a tangle. I don't see the point in scraping it back in a ponytail when she's playing. It would be much easier for both of us if it was short. I don't want to sound mean or heartless, but she's a kid, she'll like it in a few days anyway      Rose is my first child, and I don't want people to think badly of me for cutting it, but I don't believe children should have long hair. Sure, she thinks she doesn't want it cut short, but she'll soon get used to it.      Should I cut it? I mean to a kinda pixie cut, so it wouldn't be hanging in her eyes all the time. And it will be easier for me, and she won't get nits! It's all good?      And lastly, how shall I go about it? She isn't too keen on cutting it short, but I can persuade her, can't I? What's the best way of going about it? If that fails, can I just cut it anyway?

Slight cramps sometimes,   Nipples are sore,   Nauseous at times,    Dizziness comes in mid afternoon,   Heartburn, but thats pretty normal for me,   Tired alot,    and that is all the symptoms that I could think of off the top of my head   --------------------------------------...

That was after my period was already due, but I mean my tests keep coming up negative, but at times I really do feel like I am pregnant. I have another appointment tomorrow for some more pregnancy tests... also the doctor said her tests didn't come up positive until she was 6 weeks so if I did get pregnant when I was due for ovulating then I would be around 6 weeks..

My husbands mother (never been a good mother, cheated on his dad 2 x's and then left all 4 kids (2 by cheated men) for another man) went nuts on him the other day. Here's what happened: He called her to see if she wanted to come to our house to watch our 8 1/2 month old daughter (her 1st and only grandchild) for 2 hours so we could go watch a movie. She told him no and wanted to know why we weren't bringing our daughter back to her house, that's what she heard. Well we did say this b/c at Christmas she told us she wasn't sick and I overheard her on the phone say that she was running a fever = strike 1...she smokes cigarettes in her house and our daughter is VERY sensitive to it, she has respiratory problems = strike 1 1/2, she has very wild parties, let's young people get drunk and other things at her house all the time = strike 2, and here's the doosey....her boyfriend was smoking weed while we were there with our daughter at Christmas! I know some of you might not think this is a big deal, we do...anyway = STRIKE 3! So my husband proceeds to tell her these reasons why and she flips out (real mature, huh) she said she was gonna come cuss us out and all kinds of things. We live like 2 blocks from her and we have never told her that she couldn't come to our house to see our daughter, she did just a few weeks ago...but now she has no interest to see her and hasn't called or anything. Should we take our daughter down there or do you think she will come around and realize that she is going overboard with this whiole thing? Need some answers please, thanks!

20090226125404AABLlQ9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2 1/2 year old will not go to sleep at night! Help!?	I lay my son down at 7:30 every night and he doesn't go to sleep until 9:30! He gets out of his room every 5 minutes or less for almost 2 hours. He has been doing this for 2 months now. We've asked day-care not to give him a nap and that doesn't even work. He has to be up at 6:30 in the morning so that is why he goes down so early. Am I laying him down to early? What have you done that's worked? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance

According to previous postings - Playtex says there is no need to manually take out the air since they collapse on their own.  That's how they are designed.  Why do people still insist in taking out all the air?
