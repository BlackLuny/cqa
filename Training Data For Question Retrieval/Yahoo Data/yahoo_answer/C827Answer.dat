xrRZeROmaa	Piri Piri is traditionally made from PiriPiri peppers which originated in South Africa, and were imported to Portugal from two Portuguese colonies, Angola and Mozambique.  Today, most hot sauces from Portugal are referred to as Piri Piri.    Piri-piri is the Swahili word for the incendiary red peppers of Africa  primarily those of Angola and Mozambique, former Portuguese colonies. Because of the seafaring nature of the Portuguese, it didn't take long for these bite-size pods of fire to make their way to Lisbon aboard spice ships returning from the East.    Mainlanders wasted no time in turning the torrid chiles into a versatile sauce. Cooks use it as a marinade, a basting liquid, and a condiment. In fact, take a walk down an esplanade in Lisbon and you'll find bottles of piri-piri sauce dotting restaurant tables everywhere. And no wonder: It's perfect with shrimp, chicken and fish.    Although piri-piri peppers aren't available in this country, you can substitute any very hot chile, such as cayenne, piquins or santaka.|`|RPYS9HjRaa	Portugal|`|89xzNpVaaa	Its spice is from South Africa, but this sauce is used in Portuguese cuisine, and i think its spelled "Peri-Peri".|`|rQd7QuRcaa	Southern Portugal|`|EJJMXnf0aa	its birthplace was southern Portugal
RzVPOrD3aa	Some people can just "drop meat" and go vegetarian but for others like myself, it's a little harder.  I'm am still not 100% vegetarian but for the last couple of years I have eaten less and less of it and incorporated a lot more meatless dishes into my diet.  Everytime I read a book like "Skinny *****" or watch a movie like "Sweeney Todd" it makes me want to eat meat that much less.  Finding what works best for you is half the battle.  Good luck.|`|zFvmW0EAaa	dont eat meat and shop at organic food stores thats about it
qkYv5c6uaa	One simple way is to cut the sausage links in half, lengthwise.  Fry them in a pan over medium heat, you won't need to add oil because the sausage will give off plenty of grease.  When they are cooked through, add sliced green peppers and onions (cut to approximately the same sizes), and fry them in the remaining oil.  Put everything in a crusty roll, and you've got a delicious sandwich!

I have made them and occasionally go to an Italian bakery here in Toronto Canada that makes them, they make little knots with the dough and sell dipped and non dipped.    The recipe is just a butter or shortening, sugar, eggs, flour and a bit of red wine to bind, cinnamon and you can add a bit of cocoa to make them darker brown and the colour does change when fried, cool them and then dip in dark chocolate or milk, a few melted Hershey's or Tollhouse chips with a knob of butter is the trick.

Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.     Melt enough shortening (over low heat) to come just 1/8-inch up the side of a 12-inch cast iron skillet or heavy fry pan. Once shortening liquefies raise heat to 325 degrees F. Do not allow oil to go over 325 degrees F.     Drain chicken in a colander. Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Liberally season chicken with this mixture. Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess.     Place chicken skin side down into the pan. Put thighs in the center, and breast and legs around the edge of the pan. The oil should come half way up the pan. Cook chicken until golden brown on each side, approximately 10 to 12 minutes per side. More importantly, the internal temperature should be right around 180 degrees. (Be careful to monitor shortening temperature every few minutes.)     Drain chicken on a rack over a sheet pan. Don't drain by setting chicken directly on paper towels or brown paper bags.

QZ0nUuOEaa	A lot of people are telling you to use Lard not oil and I agree that Lard makes the best chips but it smells terrible when you cook with it, I know I've tried and the smell totally put me off eating the chips and the kitchen smelt awful for days.  However Trex or Cookeen is great. And twice cooking is definitely the secret to really crisp chips.  Oh and don't use the Trex/Cookeen too many times.  With the used Trex make bird food by adding lots of bread and left over food together with seeds and you not only get rid of the 'fat' safely, but look after the wild birds too.|`|LDLTjNCraa	I think they use Maris Piper potatoes, there's a start|`|AA11230878	I think they are fried in either Whale Oil or Peanut Oil, assuming you don't have an allergy to nuts|`|QEEweJUaaa	Hi there, to begin with you need the right type of potatoes, go to a fruit shop for those , all ways peel , cut , and then place the chips in a large container of clean water, 2 reasons for that , 1 it stops them from turning black and 2 allot of the starch washes of that way, before you fry them you place them on two towels and dry the water of them, to fry them i would seriously use a blend of of vegetable oil and about a cup of lard or dripping, you will find that in the butter section of your supermarket, the reason you fry chips in lard or dripping is to get that sunday roast beefy flavor and smell into them*** so how do you fry them?   make sure the oil is hot enough before you place them in by holding a chip half way in to the oil to test it , if it starts to sizzle/bubble then its time to place them in very carefully , fry for 4 minutes then take them out and place them somewhere for 5 minutes to cool down,   fry again until cooked , then!  this is the most important part! you have to make them steam in a paper parcel, and how you do that is spread out 4 sheets of newspaper, on top of that you can use a couple of sheets of butchers paper, the white paper they use in the supermarket, place the chips on that , sprinkle with salt , wrap the parcel up making sure there's no holes and leave it to steam for 4 minutes , cut a hole in one end only and start to eat, it might sound like theres allot to do but trust me , if you love soggy chips this is the best way,|`|n4JmkCuuaa	You can't! ive tried and the only way your really going to  get that flavour is if you actually purchase some! i know how annoying is that!!

When I get out after 7 nights, I will go cash my $1,900 check and buy a buttload of chocolate cookies and a tub of fudge frosting and dip the cookies in the frosting and take my clothes off and run around the house while savoring my cookies with frosting.

You can either put everything in a food processor or just chop it very finley and stir.  It's healthy (unlike most of the other stuff that will be there) and the lemon makes it refreshing.  Plus, guys don't usually cook with stuff like spinach and red pepper so it's impressive.  It's like a fancy, really good hummus.    Serve with pita triangles...|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Take a duffel bag with 2 pairs of clothes and any other necessites, bring some coke and chips

You can get tiny boxes and little ruffle wrappers at the craft store. A gift of 3 or 4 look adorable in the box. Or you can go big.    They're based on a Martha Stewart recipe. I never seem to have the liquer on hand, and they've still been great. I used a melon baller before I inherited a mini icecream scooper.     Chocolate Truffles     28 ounces total semisweet chocolate, finely chopped or chips   3/4 cup heavy cream   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature   1 1/2 tablespoons liqueur, such as Cognac, Grand Marnier  Best-quality cocoa powder     Place 16 ounces of chocolate and the cream in the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until melted; remove from heat. Add butter and Cognac, and stir until combined.     Pour this into an 8-inch square baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until it's cold and set but still pliable, about 2 hours.     Melt remaining 12 ounces chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until melted; remove from heat. Let cool to room temperature.     Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Using a 1/4-ounce ice-cream scoop, drop ganache onto one of the prepared baking sheets. Chill 10 minutes.     Coat the palm of one of your hands with about 1 tablespoon of the melted chocolate. Roll balls, one at a time, between your palms until evenly coated with chocolate. Roll in cocoa powder to coat. Transfer to second baking sheet. Repeat with remaining balls, coating your palm with more chocolate as needed.

0maJCeLCaa	yes and no - if the staff go to great lenghts to prepare and serve a unique meal, they want to do so for a guest who can appreciate the result!!   every guest may pay the same 200 for the meal, but if they don't get the idea, the meal won't be the intended experience, and all the staff's effort would have been for nothing ...
xrRZeROmaa	Cut your recipe as much as you wish, leaving as much space as you wish unfilled in your slow cooker.  Smaller amounts will reduce the cook time slightly, as the cooker is designed to heat the entire pot.  If it is programmable, set it to low, and check it thirty minutes early.      Cutting a recipe in half, and then adding other items, such as baked beans, will probably not affect the original cook time at all.  Experiment with it freely, slow cooking is very forgiving.|`|lGSUToFQaa	yes you can do that, you can go to cooks.com and it will give you recipes for cooking pork chops in a slow cooker,|`|lq8YBCwzaa	Yes it will be okay, either just turn it to a very low heat setting, or put it in for less time. I would say put it in for at least and hour or two less than you normally would. Or, do the normal serving size, save the rest for leftovers.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Whole grain has the most nutrition and fiber. Multigrain just means that there is a blend of grains. You'll need to read the label to see if it is multi-refined grains of multi-whole grains. On breads and cereals if you see whole stone ground wheat, or rolled oats, thats a good sign. If you see things like enriched or bleached, pass on it. All products will fall somewhere in between.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	whole-grain....you should get at least 3 servings of whole grain a day|`|B2duikyaaa	whole grain is better

(i'm south african)|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Mustard is just a crushed seed of an herb - with vinegar.  Good stuff - you can add it to soup too for an interesting flavor.      But if you're watching carbs, look out for catsup/ketchup - it has more sugar than coca-cola by amount.  It's pretty ugly food-like stuff.      Also watch out for mustard which had sugar added to it as well - some brands do.  There are just some companies who have to add sugar to everything. But often more ugly than sugar is that corn syrup fructose crap. It's in almost everything now.  Pretty bad news - take a look at how that stuff is produced!!      But you can still find un-sugared mustard.  Read the label.|`|AA11402528	ketchup
N53iI8weaa	Yes - but make them a bit stronger than it says on the pack - you won't come to any harm.|`|8bh0IGwJaa	You can do it that way, sure.  Heat 2 pints of water, add in 3 or 4 cubes to that.

OR    You can make your own by simmering lots of veggies, skins and all, with garlic and some salt for about 2 hours.  STRAIN WELL and use.|`|AA12349214	Yep - its the lazy way!  I put two cubes per pint - dont find that they are very strong otherwise.|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	yes unless you have made your own stock out of boiling  a load of vegetables your self  maureen|`|e4984fff739610fd75449d66ba5516a1aa	Yes a stock cube is fine but vegetable stock is basically the water in which you have boiled vegetables. Most stock cubes require at least a pint of water.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	If you want to make it properly  1 big Onion  4 Carrots  4 sticks of Celery  1 teaspoonful of Marmite  seasoned with salt and Garlic  ps throw in a couple of chicken stock  cubes to really get the taste|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	Yes, but if you want to make vegetable stock, just boil some vegetables in water, and use that water as vegetable stock.    ? CupCake ?|`|P9kT15caaa	yes 1 cube to 1pint of water|`|KMOWgrxvaa	Best made fresh:-) but who's got the time these days?  I use Marigold stock powder, I get the low-salt one.

N53iI8weaa	Be warned: Greaseproof paper sticks like sh** to a blanket - it's only meant for wrapping, not cooking.

You can spray with Pam baking spray (it also contains the flour in there); or grease & flour the pans.  I've used plain brown paper on baking sheets for meringues, because they don't bake at a high temp; but wouldn't suggest foil (since it may cause it to bake faster) or waxed paper (which can melt)|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	You could use grease proof paper, or if you don't have any, just grease the tin with butter.    ? CupCake ?|`|C3sqTngtaa	foil wont work, but have you got normal writing paper? just use that instead|`|qxz23Rxdaa	You should really use grease-proof paper, possibly tracing paper. Alternatively use margarine to grease the tray, but ensure it is done thoroughly- otherwise it may stick!! You can buy non-stick trays, do you have one, if yes use it.|`|sP98NDi5aa	I always use parchment paper. I don't like wax paper, but I'll use it in a bind, I never have it in my kitchen though. If you are in a jam and don't have any of these, grease you pan with butter, and dust with flour. That should work. Parchment paper sell in rolls for about $4 in place like Walmart or Target.
vs5rK3iRaa	Just keep it refrigerated (or frozen, if if is an ice cream cake) in the box it came in.  It should be fine, as the frosting will seal it from the air.|`|OrGQ4iBVaa	Yup. Keep it in the freezer though till then.|`|1M9w6gdnaa	As long as it's not a ice cream cake you should be fine! :-)

A spa would be a really nice thing to do with a couple of your close friends, though they do cost alot of money when you have to pay for treatment, accommodation and food.    Other ideas could be.....  You and your friends getting your nails done, cinema, party in a local hall (they don't actually cost that much), nice meal out, ice skating day trip shopping.    And some things you could combine all into one day, such as the cinema, shopping, nails, then going back to your house for a meal and dvd night in.    I'm sure you'll find something great fun to do once you start thinking, and I hope this has given you a few ideas. Have fun planning!! :) x|`|hRV18njLaa	Hire a dance hall.

vTXD8CfMaa	No that I'm aware of.  I'm pretty sure on the box it says it is best used in baking dishes and such not as a replacer for fried, scrambled, etc eggs.|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Hm, maybe. I've never used that before. but I think it's supposed to be used in desserts and stuff.     I would highly recommend Silken Tofu as an egg replacement in fried rice. I used Firm Silken Tofu in brown rice and vegetable stir fry the other day and it was delicious. I didn't know it would taste so similar to eggs but it does! The texture is almost the same!|`|wvsQ9SBcaa	I just read about 10 pages of personal blogs from vegans who use ener-g egg replacer in their meals. And basically what it comes down to is making fried rice the usual way with brown rice, your choice of veggies, and soy sauce.. but before adding about 2 tablespoons of the substitute to the pan, cook it separately then add it to your mixture.    ... hope this helps.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	It is called a "widget."    A widget is a device placed in a container of beer to manage the characteristics of the beer's head. The original widget was patented in Ireland by Guinness. The "floating widget" found in cans of beer is a hollow sphere, 3 cm in diameter.    Most beer is pressured in kegs using CO2 (carbon dioxide). This is what makes the beer carbonated and foamy. However, certain beers, like Guinness are pressurized using nitrogen which produces a smoother beer and a creamier head.     Since Guinness was designed originally to be sold exclusively at pubs and poured from taps, a challenge was presented in marketing a canned/bottled variety of Guinness.     The widget simulates the nitrogen pressurized Guinness keg. It is filled with nitrogen that is not released until the can/bottle is open (bottles, by the way, don't use a ball but a long thin version called a "rocket widget.") The nitrogen is released and then the beer can be poured into a glass and taste similar to drought beer.     Drought (or draft) beer is beer that is meant to be consumed on-tap. Drought cans/bottles are meant to simulate that on-tap taste. The widget is what accomplishes that.     You should always pour Guinness into a glass; never drink it straight from the can. Bottled Guinness can be consumed from the bottle, but it's still recommended to pour.|`|tFoFchuEaa	It's often called the "widget" and is filled with compressed gas. When you open the can (which is full of flat beer) the widget releases all the gas through the beer, giving it very small bubbles and a taste similar to that of draught beer.     There are also "rocket widgets" in Guinness bottles, and widgets in Kilkenny, Caffrey's, and Boddingtons.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	It's a promotional gimmick.    If you're drinking Guinness, you must be having a ball !

AA12198711	Roasted potatoes make a great addition to any dinner. The best roasted potatoes are full of flavor, crispy on the outside, and soft and velvety on the inside. This can be accomplished easily while preparing your main dish.    First, I start with two pounds of red potatoes. Cut the potatoes into 3/4" to 1" wedges.    Toss with 3 Tbs. oil until all pieces are coated.    Salt and pepper the potatoes generously. Toss until salt and pepper have evenly disbursed.    Place the potatoes in a 9x13 in. baking pan. Arrange the pieces so that the skin side is facing up. This will give us a nice crust on the cut side as it bakes. If desired, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary over the potatoes.    Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for twenty minutes at 425F. This will allow the potatoes to bake in their own steam to help the insides fully cook.    After twenty minutes, remove the aluminum foil and continue to bake for fifteen more minutes. Using a metal spatula, flip all the potato pieces over so the skin side is now touching the bottom of the pan. Try to keep as much of the crispy crust that has formed on the potato pieces as you flip.    Another 15 minutes in the oven and the potatoes should be done. You can keep cooking to achieve the level of color that is desired on the cut side of the potatoes. I usually stop once it reaches a light golden color.    For a strong garlic flavor, simply puree 2 cloves of garlic (once garlic has been minced, scrape with a knife to create a fine mush OR use a zester on the garlic cloves) and put it in a medium bowl. Using a metal spatula, scrape the potatoes out of the pan and into the bowl. The hot potatoes will just barely cook the garlic. Toss well.    For a milder garlic flavor, cook the garlic in a teaspoon of oil until it softens (just before it begins to brown). Toss the cooked garlic with the potatoes.

BWxSSADaaa	I like making my own spaghetti sauce and meatballs.  For the sauce, I just sautee a chopped onion with a couple of minced cloves of garlic in some olive oil.  Add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste, and then a large can of crushed tomatoes.  Then I add oregano, parsley, basil, salt and pepper to taste.  I use fresh herbs if I have them.  You can also chop up a tomato and add it in if you like a chunkier sauce.  Let it simmer for at least 30 minutes.  For meatballs, I soak about 25 g baguette in water or milk, just enough to make it really mushy.  Tear it to little bits and mix with .5 lbs ground beef, a beaten egg, a little onion chopped very fine, and minced Italian herbs.  Salt and pepper ... mix really well.  Form into golfball sized balls.  Then I fry them until nice and brown all over, and finish them in the simmering sauce, about 20-30 minutes.  For pasta, I just try not to overcook it.  I serve the pasta with the sauce on top and meatballs, and parmesan cheese grated over it.  For it to be really tasty, buy nice cheese, and grate it over your meal.|`|qm4Mbhwwaa	i make spaghetti at home all the time and a tip for the noodles if they stick to the wall they are done.

Cook for about 40 minutes to an hour and half, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon while you cook.  The sauce is done when it looks like something you would want to eat.  Right before serving, throw away the onion and stir in whatever you want- italian sausage, meatballs, whatever.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Home made is superior to most restaurant spaghetti!

fZnuyKSZaa	eggs should not be kept in the fridge unless you life in a hot country.  Modern supermarkets are cool enough to give the optimum temperature for egg storage.  If you keep them too cold you denature the egg white so the egg yolk will be unprotected..and then bacteria can have a feast going through the porous shell.  So shops who sell them in the fridge try to keep the bacteria problem which they created themselves at bay. Which is fine if you transport them home in a cooled bag..put them in the fridge immediately and hard boil them later.  Any other method like soft boiling or mayonnaise will then doubble the risk of salmonella compared to proper storage in the first place    So..if you keep them outside your chances to get ill are actually less likely..as bizarre as it might sound in our cooler obsessed society ...|`|PPyMhRJAaa	There is no need to keep them in the fridge as they get sold so quickly and they would also take up too much room.|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Eggs do not refrigeration they should be cooked at room temperature anyway.

What country do you live in?    Where I shop - they are in a refrigerated cabinet without a door.  They have to be kept cool or on hot days the whites would start to coagulate.

5Crovdoaaa	Ingredients:  2 tablespoons butter  2 cloves garlic, finely minced  dash pepper  dash salt  pinch dried dillweed or parsley  dash paprika  4 tilapia fillets  Preparation:  In saucepan, combine butter, garlic, pepper, salt, dillweed, and paprika. Heat over low heat until butter is melted and starts simmering. Remove from heat. Brush a little of the butter mixture in the bottom of a shallow baking dish (line baking dish with foil, if desired) then place tilapia fillets on the buttered area. Brush top of each tilapia fillet with the seasoned butter mixture. Bake at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes, until tilapia flakes easily with a fork.  Serves 2.|`|PenbhD1uaa	I eat a lot of tilapia and one of my favorite ways to prepare it is en papillote. This is traditionally done with parchment paper but I use aluminum foil b/c I always have that available. Depending on the size of the fish you have yo need to cut a piece of tinfoil that will be able to hold the fish inside when folded in half.    Rinse the fish and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with a little salt and black pepper. Cut up some vegetables that you like. I usually use whatever I have, asparagus, carrots or bell peppers cut into thin strips, green beans. Really whatever veggies you like. Place fish in the middle of the tinfoil piece you have already cut. Place vegetables around and on top of the fish. Add whatever seasonings or fresh herbs you like such as dill (always a good one w/ fish) Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, even Cajun spices. Drizzle a little olive oil over this and if you have white wine a couple TBSP of that (if not it's still delicious). Fold tinfoil over fish and crimp and fold the edges together so it is perfectly sealed. Place on a baking sheet and bake at 350* for about 20-25 minutes for an averaged size fillet, or about 45 minutes for a whole fish.    This is great b/c it requires practically no dishes and serve it with some sort of roasted potato or rice and you have a complete meal that's easy and has very little prep time|`|NeTNnvSZaa	do i put the oil in the pan and let it heat up then put the fisn in?

Yes    and how long do i let the fish cook for when will i know its done?     When it flakes easily with a fork, don't overcook.

Turn after about 5 minutes.|`|53giV6PFaa	Try baking it.  This is how I make white fish quite often.     First spray your dish with cooking spray so your fish won't stick.  Put a thin layer of sliced onions (I usually don't, but since you have them it wouldn't taste bad at all).  Then put your fish on top.  Pour melted butter over the top, sprinkle with season salt, paprika and dried parsley flakes. Bake at 400 for 10-20 minutes or until your fish is flaking easily.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	Doing the veggies first depends on what flavor you want the fish to have.  I would cook it like this:  Saute veggies in oil / or butter add salt to taste, remove from pan set to the side.  Then I would either pan fry on each side about 3 to 4 minutes on med heat until the meat starts to flake, (that is the best indicator that it is done) or I would broil for about 10 minutes until brown, if you like it slightly crispy on the edges, or even bake with a nice lemon butter for around 20 minutes at 350F Use a small amount of dill for color and flavor add back in the veggies and serve with brown rice and glazed carrots.  yummy.. i getting hungry now!|`|sP98NDi5aa	Let the oil heat up in the pan. Preheat oven to about 350. Chop your onions and a little garlic and place in the hot oil. Add garlic 1st, for a minute then add onions. Sear the fish on one side for about two minutes, then flip.

Put butter and white wine in pan and place pan in oven for about five minutes.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Yes, yes, it depends on the thickness; you want them opaque but not too dry. It really cooks quite fast, you won't need more than 5-10 mins per side, less if it's really thin.    Butter: sure. Also a squeeze of lemon would be nice.

QBXQJ9s4aa	It depends on your metabolism and the type of drink. Most of the time, it will be a half-hour maximum. If the drink has caffeine as the main accelerant, it will kick in within a few minutes. The crash will come within 4 hours.|`|AA11812015	Its pretty much instantaneous.|`|ssQb7bB3aa	Immediately, because it's a fluid. However, if you already have high fat content in your stomach (where the energy will be first absorbed into your body), then, it will take longer.    However, if you are already addicted to the stuff in the energy drink, ie the caffeine, then it will   (a) take longer for the effect to be felt  (b) you may need a stronger dose for the effect to be felt more quickly.|`|28724bf8270454846be8aedfc49d1560aa	Everybodys body is different but it should kick in within at least a few minutes.

5zNwBQZHaa	Some areas still use the term - but it just refers to types of alcoholic drinks made with one shot of alcohol and a mixer, and not to a specific drink.  The term might be outdated.  We tend to not use the word "cocktails" as much either, as we now just say "Drinks."  Do any of your friends say "We are going out for cocktails?"  Probably not! :-)    Here - this from wikipedia will explain the term highball better:    A highball is the name for a family of mixed drinks that are composed of an alcoholic base spirit and a larger proportion of a non-alcoholic mixer. Originally, the most common highball was made with rye whiskey and ginger ale. The Online Etymology Dictionary suggests that the name originated around 1898 and probably derives from ball meaning a "drink of whiskey" and high because it is served in a tall glass. Alternatively, New York barman Patrick Duffy claimed to have invented the highball in 1895, and that the term 'highball' comes from the 19th century railroad practice of raising a ball on a pole to urge a passing train driver to speed up. Duffy used this term to describe his method of quickly mixing a drink by simply adding the ingredients to a tall glass over ice. To enable this speedy process, Duffy used one spirit, one mixer (ginger ale or soda) and either a simple garnish (such as a twist of lemon) or none at all. Another possible explanation comes from the time of drinking. A highball, as opposed to a cocktail which is drunk in the evening before dinner, is drunk in the afternoon when the sun is high (ball referring to the sun) and should be light and refreshing.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	A high ball is the glass a number of specific cocktails are served in. It's usually a drink that is a hard alcohol base with a non-alcoholic mixer. The most common highball was made with rye whiskey and ginger ale.    Well-known examples of highballs include Jack and Coke, Scotch and Soda, Seven and Seven, the Moscow Mule, the gin and tonic, and Sex on the Beach. A highball is typically served in large straight-sided glass, for example, a highball glass or a Collins glass, with ice. The proportions of some highballs, such as the Alabama Slammer, may be alteredmade with little or no mixerand served as a shooter.|`|W1MgefrWaa	Bourbon and Ginger-ale.
IdyVps6uaa	"The Bristol Blue bottle was introduced in 1996 to mark Harveys 200th anniversary. Bristol, besides being an important seaport, had become one of Britains centers for the manufacture of fine colored glass by the 1720s. The term "Bristol Blue" arose from the fact that Bristol was the point of supply for the coloring agent, Saxon cobalt oxide (smalt), which produced the wonderful, deep blue. This oxide was not easily available in Britain until the 1760s, when a Bristol porcelain manufacturer, William Cookworthy, purchased the entire stock from the Royal Saxon Smalt Works and made it available to glassmakers throughout the country."

Here's the recipe I make all the time form Tortuga:        * ---Cake---      * 1 cup chopped, toasted pecans or walnuts      * 1 18-1/2 ounce yellow cake mix      * 1 1-3/4 ounce (4-serving size) instant vanilla pudding mix      * 4 eggs      * 1/2 cup cold milk*      * 1/2 cup vegetable oil      * 1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum      * ---Glaze---      * 1/2 cup butter      * 1/4 cup water      * 1 cup sugar      * 1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum    Preparation:  Cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour 12-cup Bundt pan. Sprinkle nuts on bottom of pan. Combine all cake ingredients. Beat for 2 minutes on high with electric mixer. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour. Cool in pan. Invert on serving plate. Prick top with fork. Drizzle glaze over top of cake. Use brush or spoon to put extra dripping back on cake.    Glaze: Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in water and sugar. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in rum. Note: The rum will cause steam. Be careful not to burn yourself.    Notes in the Margin: I have made this cake many, many times. It not only is the perfect dessert, but I've had house guests who wanted it for breakfast. My husband keeps threatening to use it for French toast. I personally think that it'll never get dry enough as it stays moist a long time. The longer this cakes sits, the better the taste. This cake freezes beautifully.

I would avoid that in the very cold temps or only if not going out.  I would personally recommend hot chocolate..as you can add warm water or milk,stir and drink.lol. If you want a drink that is soothing otherwise in the cold I know that my grandpa used to have a shot of brandy before bed and I think he lived into either his later 70's or early 80's doing this. I would think a mixed warm drink like a hot toddie (sp?) is more of what you would likely be looking for this time of year.
DFXS4SB4aa	You are correct, and a similar question was recently asked to Ms Manners. It is a gift, and can be served by the recipient whenever they so choose.|`|KGRikkJeaa	it yours to do with what you want.|`|SR5zlAl8aa	i am not sure|`|tPEzEcmEaa	the correct thing to do is,take the bottle from ur guest and ask them would they like you to open it.|`|0MnTXjn8aa	I think its in bad taste to not serve anything your guest brings.   Whenever I have company and if they bring something I always make sure I put it out what they bought.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It's a nice gesture to be able to serve it, but ONLY if it goes with the meal that's planned!   You wouldn't serve a gifted white wine with prime rib;  or a gifted red wine with Chicken Kiev.   The host has planned the meal and beverages to go together; and shouldn't be expected to serve a wine that isn't proper for the meal...    For a novel "hostess gift", try getting a couple of gourmet apples from Mrs. Prindable's (website) or Rocky Mountain Chocolate Company!  They can be snacked on later, or used as a dessert ... and they're INCREDIBLE|`|zawmsUO1aa	Firstly, bringing wine implies that the host's wine isn't good enough.    A guest cannot bring something to a host and expect it to be served unless there is a previous understanding, either express or by prior practice in the social circle. It's in fact quite rude to expect it otherwise. The guest is supposed to present the wine as something for the host(s) to enjoy later, and the host should graciously accept it even if it's something they will not enjoy (and, in the latter case, tag the bottle later to avoid awkward regifting to the giver...).|`|yhgRaBPXaa	If the wine was meant as a gift, its theirs to drink whenever. If you want to bring a bottle to drink that night, just tell the hostess you brought a bottle to drink with dinner or after...whichever you prefer. I am sure the hostess will just be pleased you were courteous enough to bring something.
5zNwBQZHaa	No, it is not.    You may have heard that phrase used by older folks because many years ago cereals did not contain as many vitamins and minerals as they do now.  So people starting saying there was more nutrition in the cardboard box than there was in the cereal.    Other people may use that phrase to describe cereal that is not sweetened and they do not like the taste of.  Some people may say this about bland cereals such as shredded wheat or Kix.    Anyway - no food is made from cardboard.  They are made from grains like wheat, corn and oats with flavors and sweeteners to make them taste better.|`|UWJinEbIaa	No but those so-called marshmallows are made of Styrofoam.|`|lhOnjkiZaa	for him yh then|`|KGRikkJeaa	its made from corn meal with other flavors and colors and sugars added to it|`|g91dQLBPaa	No. I wish it was though. loljk|`|hLohtlPEaa	He's watching too much television and no its not made out of cardboard.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	No.|`|6HIuqEUyaa	No, people say this because there is normally a lot of fibre in cereal, but it defiantly not made out of cardboard.|`|B2duikyaaa	no. it comes in a cardboard box but is not made from a cardboard box.

Good luck with it.    http://thefoody.com/cheese/cauliflowerch...|`|7JIG6Rw4aa	Cauliflower Cheese    Ingredients for four good servings  1 big cauliflower (buy two small ones if you can't find a big one)   300g pasta or your choice (macaroni, etc.)   250g cheddar cheese (or another cheese that you like)   75g smoked ham (or cooked ham if you prefer that - you will need twice the amount for cooked ham)   50g butter   50g flour   1 litre of milk   salt   pepper   nutmeg   1cl olive oil   Preparation Time: 60 minutes    Get a Cauliflower and take off the laves   Cut It up in to around 1cm per piece  Put the cauliflower into a sizeable saucepan, add some salt and about 100ml of water.   Bring to a boil and steam the cauliflower with the lid closed for about 9 minutes.   In the meantime, bring 2 litres of water to a boil, add half a teaspoon of salt and 1 cl of olive oil.   Add the pasta and boil until "al dente" - follow the instructions on your pasta package.   Whilst the cauliflower is steaming and your pasta is boiling, grate your cheese with a coarse grater.   Put the cauliflower into an oven-proof dish that is big enough. You can cut the roses into 2 or 3 parts if they are too big.   When the pasta is done, drain is in a sieve and add it to the dish with the cauliflower. Distribute the pasta and the cauliflower evenly.   Now cut your ham into squares. It is time to preheat your oven to about 180 degrees centigrade ( Time to make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan.    When the butter has melted, add the flour and stir vigorously with a whisk.    Whisk until the butter/flour mixture is nice and even and changes colour slightly.    Now add small amounts of milk, whisk again until the mixture thickens, and add more milk. You will want your hob on a fairly high setting for this and proceed quickly.    Once all the milk is added, bring to a boil again.    Add salt, pepper and nutmeg. Take it easy on the salt as we will add cheese later. Also, the ham will contain a fair amount of salt ...    Now add half the grated cheese and whisk until the cheese has dissolved. Take the saucepan off the hob.    Spread your ham on top of the cauliflower and pasta.    Then add your white sauce - distribute it evenly.    Last but not least, distribute the other half of the grated cheese on top. Put the dish into your pre-heated oven and bake for 30 minutes at 180 degrees (or until it looks like in the picture below - don't burn it :-).    Voila - your finished cauliflower cheese.

Nobody wants to eat a pizza and have the sauce running off it and sauce dripping everywhere. When you bite your pizza it should kind of explode inside your mouth and not off the pizza, thats an inconvenient mess for both you and whatever room you are eating in. Gooey and Slow is the way to go!|`|fnPyq2iqaa	PLEASE ANSWER MY LATEST POSTED QUESTIONS     THANKS|`|kToZcmOgaa	pizza sauce is supposed to be sorta thick and sorta liquidy. and you can actually go to your local pizza store and buy some for really cheap ( you can also buy the dough)|`|mxEzagl7aa	Pizza sauce should be slightly thinner than what you are looking for when it is applied to the pizza, as a properly cooked pizza will actually have the sauce thicken slightly as it cooks.  You could use thick, pasty sauce, but remember that it will probably get even thicker as the pizza cooks in the oven.
Fnajjc8Maa	When we can't use our grill, we cook our steaks in the oven.    Season your steaks as you normally would, use a little EVOO in the bottom of a cast iron skillet, place seasoned steaks in skillet, sprinkle a little EVOO over the top.   We preheat the entire oven to 500 degrees,  use the lowest rack in your oven, once prehearted, change the setting on the oven to broil.  Cook about 7-10 minutes on each side, depending on how well done you like your meat and how thick it is.    We love to saute mushrooms and onions in a little butter and minced garlic to garnish our steaks with.    Okay,  now I am hungry for steak!|`|v239PAC8aa	I put steak seasoning on it.

Simmer until done.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Please what ever you do, DO NOT just cook it in the oven, and specially to do no tcook it in the oven and then finish it in a skillet. That is backwards.    Also you  don't simmer a good steak. You can pan fry it and then reduce the heat but DO NOT simmer good steak. That is a waste of money.    Brown the steaks in a skillet, then place under the boiler. Not the highest spot but not the lowest one either.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You can cook steak in the oven and finish on the stove top in a skillet; preferably cast iron but stainless steel will work. Do not cook steaks in a nonstick (Teflon) or aluminum pan.     Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Season entire surface of steaks liberally with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1 1/2 inches thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook 20-25 minutes for medium rare; 25-30 minutes for medium.    Heat a few tablespoons of oil (veg or canola) in a pan until it is screaming hot; smoking even. Put the steak in and cook on one side until brown and crusty... 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. Flip it over, cook for another 2 - 2 1/2 minutes and you're done. The sides might not be completely done; you can use tongs to sear the edges of each steak.     Transfer to a wire rack and let them rest for about 5-10 minutes. This would be a great time to make a pan sauce.    Cooking in the oven first then in the pan gives you a juice, flavorful steak that isn't unevenly cooked and still has the seared, almost grilled flavor.|`|97G3OJCOaa	Use  the  broiler,,,,,,,heat  it  for  20  minutes  and  then  7 minutes  on  each  side.Use  a  timer|`|hHCdXq0Naa	We're BBQing tonight, and it's in the 20's here:)   Unless it's actually snowing, I still send my husband out there:) ....

If the egg plant pieces are bigger than the apple, cook the egg plant for a bit first and then add the apple when the egg plant is close to being soft.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	This always gets rave reviews - even from people who hate eggplant!    Eggplant Bruschetta    Eggplants, sliced into 1/3 inch rounds  Olive Oil  Salt & Pepper  Herbs de Provence (optional)  1 basket cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or roughly chopped  1 cup of fresh mozzarella, chopped roughly  1 handful of fresh basil, washed, dried, and chopped  1 - 2 garlic cloves, minced  Balsamic vinegar    Place the eggplant on a tray lined with paper towels.  Salt them lightly and cover them with another paper towel.  Let them sit about 30 minutes at room temp (this helps them draw out the moisture so it's not a big mushy mess when you cook them).    In a medium bowl toss together tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic cloves, and basil.  Toss with a good drizzle of EVOO and balsamic, salt and fresh pepper.  Set aside at room temp.    Fire up your grill to medium-high, or heat a grill pan to medium-high, or turn on your broiler.      Brush the eggplant lightly with olive oil (or olive oil spray is good too) and I like to sprinkle a little Herb de Provence on them, but it's not necessary - and toss the eggplant on the grill.      Cook about 4 - 5 minutes on each side, until they have some nice grill marks and are a little crisp.  Plate them on a serving platter and top with the tomato mixture.      It is sooooo good and really easy!|`|AA12031316	MMMMMMMMMM.

mlmSRkhGaa	I am not doing MORE home cooking since I am single and never ever eat at a restaurant in the first place.  I am cooking differently, however.  I am cooking more beans, less red meat.  Additonally, I am cooking now for a Community Dinner place where food is served free to anyone who arrives.  Because there is a large population of people who need help near me, I have given to volunteering at the Center.

At first, I really missed going out to eat, but now, I realize that I am the one in control of my ingredients, and that I don't have to concern myself with how sanitary a kitchen is, or if someone has dropped my food on the floor, or done something even worse, lol!  I actually enjoy eating at home more now.  I have become much more aware of what goes into "food" in this country, and its not always good!  Many restaurant foods are so packed with chemicals and flavor enhancers that your body just simply does not know how to process.  One thing my daughter and I have started doing is having a picnic night.  If the weather is good, we go to our favorite lake spot, but even if its cold outside, we throw a blanket on the living room floor and have a fondue party.  Its as much fun as going out, and costs WWWWAAAAYYYY less, and we find we actually enjoy it more.|`|53giV6PFaa	Yes it has affected us.  I am a good cook and my family loves my cooking, but I am also very busy with working full time and going back to college.  So going out to eat or getting carry out helps me out a lot, and we have favorite restaurants that we go to or take out.  We did this at least once or twice a week especially on my late nights with classes or exam nights.    My husband was laid off due to the automotive industry failing, so we are now down to my income and unemployment at about 60% of what he was bringing home.  So we have to budget everything carefully.  I'm back to cooking now, which is fine, but with my schedule it's really time consuming for me.  My husband is not a cook at all and burns things all the time even with a recipe, but he does help out with all the house cleaning and laundry so I really don't mind cooking. I just wish there was more time in the day and I do miss some of my favorite dishes at the restaurants we used to go to.
645f22bb5276db3f04c079d08107890caa	Ask them what they would like. What if they hate salad? You should be talking to them about what they like!|`|FKqtAhjraa	Well I usually am more comfortable if it is not dinner with people I am really not that close with.  I don't know what they like, allergies, special diets, etc.  I usually just have a "coffee klatch" ? is what my mother called it.  Hot coffee and Hot tea or iced tea, deserts, fresh fruit, crackers or bread twists,cheese.  I usually just arrange them on the table and set dessert plates and cups and glasses,utensils. Then we can sit and talk and they can pick at what they like.  It is more comfortable to me that way as a hostess and as a guest. You know less formal.  No one feels pressured to eat or like something.  And there is surely something on the table they can /like to eat. And it can be so easily done with pretty plates and a trip to the supermarket deli/bakery.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Having a salad bar is a good start to the meal, but wouldn't be enough for a main dish in winter.  Steaks, roast chicken, lasagna, pork chops - just about anything that you're comfortable making would be good.  Double-stuffed baked potatoes are good with steaks, chicken and chops.  You could also add a fruit salad ....  Dessert could be as simple as ice cream with chocolate sauce and a pretty cookie|`|0HAn67yZaa	i would make spaghetti, and some garlic bread and let them make their own salad.|`|jUBHGKf2aa	Pasta, goes great with a salad. Ziti can be made ahead of time and kept warm in the oven. I wouldn't try the salad bar . Just fix the salad before hand and keep in the fridge. You don't want too much last min things to do when you have guests. If there is something in the salad they don't like, they can pick it out ;) Find some wonderful bread and serve warm. Easy things are always the best when you are busy.  Do any dessert you are good at making and enjoy yourself.  Have fun|`|5FXx0Mymaa	Ham, baked beans, potato salad, deviled eggs, apple grape salad, dinner rolls, carrot/celery/pepper slices. Dessert either cheesecake or bread pudding.|`|a8UX1tHLaa	spaghetti. homemade sauce. my mom makes it bangin'.  answer mine?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|P0EAzyw8aa	Never add salad dressings to the salad serve it in a gravy boat or small dish so people can add their own as  some people do not like dressing on a salad, stay away from nuts,milk and eggs as some people have allergies. most people eat chicken, I would stay with simple food no heavy casseroles or sauces.White wine with white meat or seafood and red wine with red meat/roasts. Have mineral water on standby as some people do not drink alcohol and can be offended if they have to ask do you have any soft drink or juice. A simple salad with red onions tomato's shredded carrot and mixed lettuce is good and colourful with ingredients most people will eat. Don't go overboard with dips or nibblies people overfill and not eat dinner.|`|hT7BhNamaa	celebrat, try this for a change, your there with the salad. Now get a New York strip steak for each person, just a light coating of Dijon mustard then roll in cracked pepper, in a heavy pan sear both sides and give them 4 minutes or so each side ( 3/4" thickness) some nice gravy. To be a hit, do a baked whole potato each (wrapped in foil) serve with butter and a nice shredded bitey Jack cheese.    They will think your a Genius.|`|oAQib10naa	I think Susan's answer is a good one.  Baked ziti is always a crowd pleaser and your salad will do just fine, just make one big bowl of salad and have several kinds of dressings available.  Garlic bread or dinner rolls will be great.     So for the ziti, just boil the noodles until al dente and drain.  Mix in your favorite red sauce and ricotta cheese (I use 1 lb of ricotta per 1lb of pasta).  Spoon half into a baking dish and sprinkle with some parmesan and shredded mozzarella cheese.  Add more ziti/sauce/cheese and top with mozz/parm.  Bake at 325 until the sauce bubbles and cheese starts to melt, then turn off the oven and leave the ziti in there til you're ready to eat.

You hold it with a wooden stick that is inserted in the center of the frank. It is like a Shiskabob only you use the corn batter and the frank in one! It sure made me hungry!

geih5vR8aa	Pro's:   Decent money, even if it's part time at a good bar  Meet lots of people  Even in a bad economy, people still want to get drunk    Cons:  Bad hours  Bad tips in a crappy bar  Men will hit on you constantly making you feel unsafe  People will scream at you when you get there order wrong, or if you take forever to get it to them.  Bar fights  Watching people have fun, when you have to work.|`|LaUouVtfaa	The tips are awesome, it's REALLY fun. Escpecially if you're a girl working in a sports bar. That's where you make the most money, but no one wants to see a dude behind the bar.|`|jlTANWWdaa	Bartending is addicting!  You get used to the tips and they are hard to give up.  Cons the fights and the BS serving a drunk customer.  Just think if you ever worked retail.  Really I do like it and have been at it steady for the last 10 yrs.  A hint also DON"T take a bartending class!!!!  Try bar backing or **** tailing at your local watering hole and get the experience then move on to a busier spot or night club.  Bartending school is a waste of money.  Good luck and have fun!!!|`|AA11537248	Pros:    -Socialize while you work.  -Drink while you work.  -Hours are typically evening-late night, so you can go to school or another job.  -Get paid by the hour + tips.  -A lot of drunks are generous tippers.      Cons:    -If the bar's dead, you don't make  much in tips.  -Dealing with drunken idiots. (i.e. fights, harassment)  -Late hours...it's hard to get up for 8am when you got in after leaving the bar at 3am.  -Drama.  There's always one couple who gets in a fight.  -Drugs.  Bars, namely their bathrooms, are where the deals/usage happen.  -Listening to the same 20 lousy songs on a jukebox over and over.  -Desperate drunks with no money.  -Mopping up puke/blood/urine.  -Keeping coolers/refrigerators filled.  -Keeping kegs tapped.  -Trying to keep your register drawer matching your receipt tape while having 8 people waving empty glasses at you.  -Mixing up some 10-drink concoction for an airhead who isn't sure what she wants, while having 8 people waving empty glasses at you, while trying to keep your register square, only to find that the person who ordered the elaborate drink doesn't like it or doesnt have the money to pay for it.    You get the picture.|`|Z5xS2NVsaa	The tips are great, and you will always get work.|`|EMZa78Ydaa	The pros are good money (sometimes), interesting experiences, getting to meet a lot of people, and being in control.  The cons are working for tips, drunk people, being surrounded by booze, and lousy hours for going to school.    Oh yeah, drunk people are oftentimes terrible.  Did I mention the drunk people?|`|uUMDZdOIaa	pros-great money  free drinks  meet lots of people  what better job than gettting paid to hang in a bar all day  generally you can always find work bartending.  not like you have to have a degree or anything.    cons-annoying customers  late nights|`|KrkftOfkaa	Tips can be very good, depends on the bar market in your area and the type of crowd the bar draws.  Trendy metro club tender vs hick-ville beer bar there's a big difference.  The better places are going to hire more experienced and trained individuals, typically much harder to get into.    Hours are a bit rough as you are closing up at 2 AM and you typically don't get out until about 3 am, 4 am, or later.  Depends on how much closing responsibilty you have.    Your shoes (and clothes) are likely going to be beer/alcohol/genaric fluid soaked most of the time.  Again depends on the bar.  Also if a smoke ban isn't in effect in your area you are going to reek of smoke and be exposed to large amounts of 2nd hand smoke 20-40+ hours a week.    Depending on the pace of the bar you do get to be fairly social with your customers.  That's part of the job too, if you're good at your job.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	I've never done bartending before, but here are the pro and cons that I would imagine that a bartender would have.    Pros: get to meet interesting people every day. tips, never get bored, opportunity to maybe become part-owner of an establishment, it's legal, possible opportunity to travel.    Cons: bar fights, possibly victim of robbery, irate customers.
PBbLDI8iaa	It's a good source but not the best. It has a lot of fat in it so over eating it may not be a good thing for your figure. TVP (texturized vegetable protein) is a really great of protein and is great for making veggie burgers. Also wheat gluten is a good source of protein. And, as you may know soy products are high in protein but people have mixed feelings about them and I don't know where you stand when it comes to the bean and it's spin off products such as tofu and tempah. But regardless they do contain lots of protein. Hope that helps ;)|`|b0LmNT2qaa	yes it is|`|slQX22Dsaa	yes and its really good.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Yes but loaded with fat.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Absolutely!  Peanut butter is a great source of protein.
iEB1imSYaa	I always clean my chicken before I cook it. I'd hate to pass on a nasty STD.  LOL  Seriously though. Chicken is ripe with bacteria. Some of which won't be killed unless the bird is cooked thoroughly. It can make you really sick and a few people have even died from Salmonella poisoning after eating undercooked chicken. As far as "cleaning it beforehand, the only way I can see to kill the bacteria before cooking would be to use an anti-bacterial soap and I gotta believe that would leave a bad taste in your mouth. It may not be a bad idea to rinse it under the tap though.|`|UY6mkCk2aa	You could get food poisoning or terribly sick because of all the bacteria still in it, and being in that stuffy plastic packaging, so please.....just clean you food before cooking it and wash your hands :)|`|7cUDstdjaa	Very important to wash out the inside of the chicken as it removes any blood traces.  Wash also the entire bird as you don't know how it's been handled before you got it.  Also helps it you rub a little salt all over and inside|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You could get so sick you'd be begging someone to shoot you.  Seriously - you shouldn't even be asking so foolish a question.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	You could get sick.  I mean, it's been sitting in it's own blood for days, bacteria has grown, and there may be bits of stuff from the butchering plan still on the meat.  Just give it a good rinse and pat it down with some paper towel, it only takes a minute.|`|AA10021093	Your going to be cooking it right? 350-400 degrees?    The heat will kill anything, so don,t clean if you do not want to,  I done it for 20 years, and I,m still kicking.|`|RZgByhoEaa	you could get very very sick like food posion even death. I suggest to clean it with a bowel of water mixed with lemon juice and clean the chicken with that. Then pat it dry with a paper towel. The lemon juice will kill the bacteria the chicken has. =)
sODHwf1Maa	Yes, obviously. Here in Norway we eat it around Christmas times every year.    What does Yenta mean? If it is supposed to be girl, its spelled 'Jenta'.|`|mPLXUorTaa	It's also made from cow and sometimes sheep or goat.    I eat it.  Black pudding from the UK isn't my favorite.  Morcilla, popular in Latin countries, is really good.  The Cajun boudin (noir) sausage is my absolute favorite and it's a blood sausage.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Yes, it's really quite good. The texture is probably the most unusual part of it; it's a bit crumbly and not as firm as normal sausage. Plus it's a dark black color.    Otherwise, there's really nothing wrong with it; it's quite tasty. Morcilla is my favorite.|`|665cbd6ba0fe8dcbe4e2e1beccc8b5d5aa	is that anything like Blood pudding?  If so my step dad LOVES it.. my mom and I will leave the house as it stinks it up when he cooks it...  (he's scottish)|`|fDYxwfYwaa	No, but I have heard of people eating it. I believe that it is a German dish.|`|0MnTXjn8aa	oh I actually made it a few months ago. I am very Italian and married an Irishman, and he wanted me to make this. I was very turned off by this lol  But it was very easy to make I tasted a little bit of it. Its not really something I would eat. I make it for him every now and again.

p3KPM1Nqaa	Depending on what type of pizza you're going for, these are all good suggestions.  For something thick/creamy, yogurt would be a good way to go - especially greek yogurt.  You can use any number or sweetener or extracts to make the 'sauce' even better... The last time I made one, I made it a banana flaovr with extract.    Ganache would be a great way to go if you love chocolate or just want a more rich topping.    Personally, I would prefer a fruity sauce if cream cheese were not an option.  For instance, take some apricot preserves, thin it out for a few teaspoons water (per 1/2 cup or so of preserves), and nuke it in the microwave... Spread it over your 'crust' (pre-baked, that is), and then either chill first, or add toppings and then chill.  It's SO ooey, gooey, fruity, and GOOD!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	You could put a thick vanilla cream pudding on the bottom - but don't bake it on the crust!|`|2b7ErdOqaa	The easiest is Instant Vanilla Pudding (put on after the crust is cooked and cooled). The best is Bavarian Cream - which is probably what you had in Switzerland. It takes a little bit of work but is definitely worth it. You can use any extra in Cream Puffs or Eclairs.    VANILLA BAVARIAN CREAM (makes 5 cups)    1/3 c sugar  pinch salt  1 T gelatin (unflavored)  5 large egg yolks  1 2/3 c milk  1 c heavy cream    Refrigerate the mixing bowl for whipping the cream. Have ready a fine strainer near the range, suspended over a small mixing bowl.     In a small, heavy, noncorrodible saucepan, stir together the sugar, salt, gelatin, and yolks until well blended, using a wooden spoon.    In another small saucepan (or a heatproof glass measure if using a microwave on high power) heat the milk to the boiling point. Stir a few tablespoons into the yolk mixture; then gradually add the remaining milk, stirring constantly. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, to just before the boiling point (170o - 180o F). Steam will begin to appear and the mixture will be slightly thicker than heavy cream. It will leave a well-defined track when a finger is run across the back of a spoon. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir well. Immediately remove from the heat and pour into the strainer, scraping up the thickened cream that settles on the bottom of the pan.     In a chilled bowl whip the cream until it mounds softly when dropped from a spoon. Refrigerate.    Cool the sauce in an ice-water bath, stirring with a large wire whisk until whisk marks barely begin to appear. The mixture will start to set around the edges but will still be very liquid. Fold in the whipped cream with your whisk, just until incorporated. The mixture will be soupy like melted ice cream. If you are making a Charlotte (which you are not), you would pour this at this point into a 6-cup lady-finger lined bowl. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before unmolding.    But for you - the way I do it is to allow the Bavarian Cream to be chilled in the refrigerator instead of stirred over ice water. It will take about 1 1/2 hours to thicken and should be stirred occasionally. The advantage of refrigeration over ice water is that the thickening process is more gradual so there is less danger of the mixture becoming too thick before folding in the remaining ingredients.    Hope this helps. I've made this recipe many times and it's always turned out perfect - again, I use the refrigerator method.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Use creme fraiche or natural yoghurt as a substitute.|`|53giV6PFaa	You can try mixing 1 7 ounce jar marshmallow creme  and 8 ounces of plain yogurt instead of cream cheese.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Use a fruit dip, or go really decadent & use a chocolate ganache.      9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped   1 cup heavy cream   1 tablespoon dark rum (optional)       Place the chocolate into a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot. When the cream has come to a boil, pour over the chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Stir in the rum if desired.   Allow the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake. Start at the center of the cake and work outward. For a fluffy frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick, then whip with a whisk until light and fluffy.     Instead of pouring over cake, just let it cool a bit to get a thicker consistency, then spread over your "pizza" base.
zawmsUO1aa	Fresh mushrooms throw off a lot of liquid when they cook, so imagine what they'd be like after freezing. Yuck.     How about making duxelles instead and freezing that instead?    1. Chop mushrooms coarsely (you already did that step)  2. Saute mushrooms in oil and butter with chopped onion, chopped shallots, salt, pepper, nutmeg, white wine, and with chopped parsley added.  3. Stir over a lively flame so that any surplus moisture in the mushrooms is evaporated.    4. Allow the cool and then freeze.    You could add a splash, of any good brandy instead of white  wine. Less is more here. Beware of liqueurs, they will caramelize the  duxelles' subtle flavors.     Remember that the mushroom flavor will be concentrated - use in soups, stews or gravies.|`|ZLI8Ogdlaa	You can freeze them.

wZYs1Nz6aa	Here's a fail safe recipe for Victoria Sponge cake:  4 Eggs, beaten together  225 grams self raising flour  225grams of butter/margarine  225grams caster sugar    1. Pre heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius and grease and line two 8 inch cake tins.    2. Cream together your butter and sugar with an electric whisk or metal spoon until really pale and fluffy.    3. Gradually add your beaten eggs to the butter/sugar mixture a little at a time, mixing well between each addition.    4. Fold the flour into the mixture gently until it's well combined. If the mixture is too thick (it should drop easily off the back of a spoon) add one or two tablespoons of cold water.    5. Divide the mixture evenly between your two cake tins and bake in the middle of your oven for about 25min's. Insert a skewer or toothpick into the middle of each cake to see if they're ready. The skewer should come out clean, if it doesn't put the cake back in for about 5 more min's.    6. Leave your cakes to cool in the tins for about 10min's, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.     7. When the cakes are completely cool, sandwich them together with whipped cream and strawberry jam.    8. Enjoy!

5OV7ULdVaa	Fry half of your potatoes in Olive Oil and season them to match your main dish. Like if you were doing lamb, add some rosemary etc. Skies the limit there. Add them and the oil when you mash (You'll need to reduce butter obviously).    This adds a great layer of flavor and texture to the dish.    Enjoy and Good Luck.|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Make your mashed potatoes just like you normally would, then add a dash of nutmeg and an egg.  Whip the egg into the potatoes well.

Start with russets, Idaho etc.. Just a plain basic potato, no need for red potatoes, or Yukon golds etc Just stay with the classics here.  2. Don't over boil the potatos the way to tell when they are done is just when a fork can be poked all the way thru a potato with out any force.  3. Drain well or you will have a thin watery mashed potato.  4. When you emtpy your potatos back into the bowl to mash, weather you hand mash or use a mixer just mash the potatos and seasonings without the butter and milk first. Then when you get the consistentcy you want add some milk and butter and stir/fold it in. Potatos can sometimes get a glue like consistentcy due to the starch, mixing them "dry" frist helps to prevent that.    Seasoning ideas.    I like to use white pepper in my potatos, but don't use as much it's very strong.    I also like garlic powder/salt, onion powder/salt, and celery salt.    If they taste a little bland add a dash or two more salt, the salt helps to bring out the buttery, creamy-ness of the potatos.    Cream is good in mashed, and I also like to use evaporated milk, it has a nice consistncy with out being to overboard and is realtvly cheap.    You can also add cream cheese, ricota cheese, sour cream, and I haven't trie d fets yet but now I want to. Buttermilk is good too.    ****  A good recipe for left over mashed taters.    1/2 cup flour  1/4 tsp salt  1 egg lightly beaten  1 tsp baking powder  1 cup mashed potatoes-warmed just a bit  1 tsp dried parsely    Mix everything together and form into little round balls, then fry in hot oil, drian and enjoy.    Or you can make these into potato pancakes and just mash the balls flat.  Good luck and enjoy.    If you really want to use red taters for mashed here is a recipe we used to use at my Mother in laws restaurant. I havent had them in ages and they sure do sound good right now, just something different.    2 lbs red potatoes-quartered  1 ? tbsp mashed potatoes  3 tbsp butter  1 cup sour cream    Boil taters with skin on until tender.

Steaming keeps in a lot more flavor than boiling, so for really creamy, tasty spuds be sure to steam them!

roBDID2Saa	Soy milk is good for you! It's packed with nutrients & is much healthier and natural than milk...think of the hormones and diseases that are transfered over when we drink cow's milk. "Vitamin D" is a commercial ploy to get everyone to drink milk. The truth of the matter is broccoli has more vitamin D than milk! And there's many different foods you can eat and get your vitamin D. Not to mention providing your body a wide varietly of options...not just from one food source.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	You sure can, but soy milk don't taste that great. Some prefer rice milk. Rice milk is more like fat free cow milk in taste. Not sure about other milks, like those made from nuts and what not. The silk soymilk plain contains about  119IUs of vitamin d, so soymilk is a great source for vitamin D.|`|llkSmgLJaa	Soy milk is a good replacement for cows milk. It has verything milk has except the cholesterol, and lactose.|`|fBW54cAraa	Most soymilk has vitamin D and calcium in it, so you should be fine, as long as you don't have a soy allergy.  Personally I think soymilk tastes better.  I like the Silk brand.|`|b0LmNT2qaa	yes you will try silk it is very good for you|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Most soy milks have been fortified to have a nutritional profile similar to, if not superior, to Cow's Milk. Read the label to be sure.      Vitamin D?  They put Vitamin D into soy milk just the same way they put it into Cow's milk.    Cow's milk is not a nutrient powerhouse as all the advertising they throw at us leads us to believe.  The only think you are going to be missing in any Soy Milk is Cholesterol.|`|Ga1PREO9aa	As Noah said, soy milk is fortified, but just go outside and you'll get vitamin D from the sun! =P|`|eshummTJaa	soy milk is full of nutrition and vitamins....    cow milk has nutritional content of what? I won't give that to the cat ...ick..|`|AA10281378	You have plenty of replacements for milk actually. You can try Soy milk (which I don't prefer, sometimes has a gnarly aftertaste)...like from Silk. You can try Rice milk (which I don't like...it's a bit chalky)...like from Rice Dream. MY personal favourite is Almond Milk. I buy mine from the company Blue Diamond. It has a smooooooth taste to it (i prefer chocolate btw!!!) no bad aftertaste..it's delicious. The Blue Diamond almond milk has Vitamin D in it as well Vitamin A,   Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, & Sodium. IMO it's the best milk alternative I've ever tried in my life.
mPS2Zccaaa	The best thing to do would be to make a new cake. If there was still a bit of liquid on the top that means it wasn't thoroughly cooked. If you put it back in the oven with the frosting, it will melt and you will have a pool of frosting in your oven. The cake isn't cooked so people will be eating raw eggs and someone could get very sick. When you are baking a cake always stick a toothpick or thin knife in the middle to ensure that it's cooked; it should come out clean. The middle is the part that takes the longest to cool.    Good luck!|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	Start again. If you put it back in the oven the frosting will melt and burn. If you eat it as it is you could risk getting food poisoning from uncooked eggs. And like everyone else said, next time stick a toothpick into the middle of the cake to see if it's ready.|`|LqI1ilbsaa	I suggest that you put this one down to experience and start again ,the reason it was still runny on top is that it probably wasn't cooked enough.make sure that you test it with a skewer when you take it out of the oven, if it comes out clean and the cake feels firm to the touch then it should be ok But dont  give up keep trying Practise is all it takes.Good Luck|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Just eat your raw cake and chalk it up as a learning experience.    Raw cake is good in a bowl with milk poured over it.    Get a spoon and enjoy.    You could have saved it before you frosted it.  Now you cannot go back.    You tried.  Keep it up.    I am the best cook.  People beg me for my bread, bagels, pretzels, pita, braided cheese bread, etc...    I am having my 47th birthday today.  I have been cooking since I was 10 years old.    Keep working on it.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	toss it in the trash can and start over.|`|ApHLa19Faa	It's too late - the frosting would melt.

aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	I recommend going to a chinese buffet if you want to try new things. Going to a buffet doesn't mean you have to over eat, you can just try a little of whatever looks good.    Things they have that carry-out places may not, are things like peanut butter chicken, crab cakes cooked in actual crab shells, squid salad(tiny pieces of squid cooked with green peppers and spices), bacon wrapped crab, and frosted peanuts (for dessert) . I even went to one restaurant that had deep fried sushi!    My favorite, though, is still the standard chinese-american General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. If you don't know what that is, general tso's is basically fried chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce. Crab rangoon is a crab meat and cream cheese fried wonton.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Chicken Chow Mein   Sweet 'n' Sour Chicken   Egg Fried Rice   Prawn Crackers   Vegtable Spring Rolls|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I really enjoy dumplings of all kinds.

hHCdXq0Naa	I'd use the red wine vinegar.  Balsamic actually has a sweet flavor, and too strong of a flavor to use as much as you'd use of the other vinegars for a marinade.  Plus, I'm not sure it has enough acidity in it to tenderize your meat (which is why you use vinegar or liquor in a marinade)|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You can use red wine, white wine or regular distilled vinegar in place of Apple Cider. Don't use balsamic; it's expensive, sweet and might give the dish an off color.|`|31502c4099a13ff4b194118f2c724fddaa	you certainly can just know that the coloring will change|`|geih5vR8aa	You can use either one. Balsamic vinegar has a strong sweet taste to it. I would use the red wine vinegar. It's not at potent, and is considered to a lot of chef's and cooks to be an everyday vinegar. Balsamic is great for dressings/marinades, or reduction sauces where it's gonna be the main focus. If you use balsamic as a marinade, try pairing it with a good extra virgin olive oil.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Yes, but I would opt. for the red wine rather than the Balsamic...too dark and sweet.

This is my version....    start boiling about 6-8 large potatoes for mashes potatoes    cook 1-1.5 lb ground beef in a large skillet with 1 small chopped onion  to that add 1 small can tomato sauce and a can/jar beef gravy  add about 1.5 cups frozen mixed veggies (green beans, diced carrots, corn)  add some flavor with 2 Tb worcestershire, 1T balsamic vinegar, and 1 t cumin  simmer for about 5-10 minutes then turn off heat    mash your potatoes with some butter and milk as usual and spread them on top of your meat and veggie mixture.  If your skillet is not big enough for all that,  transfer the meat and veggie mixture to a casserole dish - then top with mashed potatoes.    dot the top of your potatoes with butter and if you'd like, sprinke with a little paprika    put the pie under a broiler for about 3-5 minutes until the butter has melted and the top is golden    Voila.  Enjoy!|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Build your own type of meals work best for this situation I think:    Taco bar - put out hard and soft tortillas, ground beef, grilled chicken, then salsa, veggies, sour cream etc and let people make their own tacos.  All that stuff can be used later to make mini pizzas (just save the leftovers, get some pizza sauce and those pillsbury bread squares you bake and then again, everyone can decided what toppings they want  on their pizza and you can bake them all at the same time.

Coat the chops with the spice mixture, place them in a large plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate.     Fire up the grill, bringing the heat to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test).     Remove the chops from the refrigerator and let them sit covered at room temperature for about 20 minutes.     Spray the chops with oil and transfer them to the grill. Grill for 18 to 20 minutes total. Turn onto each side twice, rotating the chops a half turn each time to get criss-cross grill marks. The chops are done when just a hint of pink remains at the center. Serve hot.

entB7tPQaa	PETA (don't everyone flip out on how they're phycos already) has a lot of nutritional recipes for vegetarians/vegans. Your doctor is misinformed: my doctor actually was proud of my choice (I'm 15). Its a healthy and compassionate decision. Try to eat a lot of proteins, like Bocca and Morning Star (faux meats) are delicious and I believe Bocca has a lot of soy protein. I personally think most of their food is delicious. Still, find a good nutritionist you can have nearby. ;) I am actually pretty estatic to find another young vegetarian, so yay! (lol)<br>  Oh, also my immune system kind of faltered for a while, I think because of the sudden shock of extreme diet change. But now I just feel great and energetic, and am stepping up to veganism. From the bottom of my heart, absolute best of luck!!!|`|LKgC9VQdaa	Yeah Vegetarians go against nature to begin with and doing it at such a young age can affect your growth and physical development a lot as humans just aren't meant to live on non meats. I'd start eating meat again if I were you unless you want your growth stunted|`|1zNfZEDdaa	Ok first of all that's one silly doctor!!! Lots and lots and LOTS of kids and teens go vegetarian for animal rights/welfare and for general health. <br>  <br>  There is calcium in milk and basically all foods and protein is in EVERYTHING except fats sugars and fruits. So you're getting plenty of protein, in fact most of america suffers from protein overloads. <br>  Things that have protein though (if you're overly concerned) Are beans, nuts, broccoli, TOFU, and all the rest of the foods except what i mentioned. (these just have the most) <br>  <br>  Go to your library and rent vegetarian books! I just became vegetarian like a week ago too! I went semi vegetarian for a month though beforehand. <br>  But "The vegetarian way" is a GREAT book! I read it in two days and it has all the foods with things in them people worry about you not getting when you have a diet with no meat. <br>  Iron is another important one to keep up on! <br>  Especially being a girl, I struggle with this one anyways, but once again that book has foods with iron in them listed. <br>  <br>  Eating meat is not healthy for you really, and it slowly clogs your arteries. Cutting out meat cuts heart diesease by 50% and also reduces breast cancer, other cancers and osteoperosis!<br>  <br>  Not to mention it helps tons of animals. If you watch a video on animal cruelty on youtube you'll never look back. It was honestly the most disgusting thing i've ever seen! Poor animals! <br>  <br>  But no worries chica! You'll get a great balanced diet eating vegetarian,<br>  things to eat are of course, fruits and veggies, but vegetarians eat LOTS of grains! Try to stick with whole wheat ones though, <br>  Eat pasta's, rice, vegetable soups (make sure they don't use chicken broth) beans, breads, cheese filled raviolis, cheese pizza's, yogurts, egg sandwitches. Possibilities are limitless and much better for you! <br>  Don't worry at all =] and MUCH luck!|`|AA11534382	First of all, good for you for venturing out and doing what YOU feel is right. Congrats! Not only are you helping yourself but you are saving the planet and defenseless animals all over the world!<br>  <br>  Your body will adapt over time to the new dietary changes. <br>  <br>  Try taking a multi-vitamin, drink lots of water, getting a good amount of sleep in & 30 mins of exercise a day along with your new diet. <br>  <br>  Check out PETA's website. www.peta.org <br>  <br>  I became a vegetarian because of them when I was in high school. I'm now a Vegan and I rarely get sick. There are SO many good websites for food recipes and help with a veggie diet. The biggest mistake new veggie's make is living off carbs and pasta.

The thing is that you are going to have a problem getting as much protein as you usually would from your meat diet under a vegetarian diet. Thus, you need to start adding new things to your normal meal plan. <br>  Firstly, soybeansm which are will quickly become your new best friend. There re are soy burger, soy hot dogs, even entire soy turkeys, which imitate the texture and flavor of meat and will help you get necessary protein that you're missing from eating meat. Lots of nuts and whole grains will also help you get the proper amount of protein, as well as other improtant vitamins and minerals. Vitamin B-12 is another necessity that you normally get from meat, but which can be obtained from other animal products such as eggs, milk and cheese. If you are vegan, some cereals are enriched with this vitamin. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
pVzUS29qaa	I am sure that would be fine.  Gravy is just thickened stock, so your alternative would work.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	I am not sure either....gravy is so rich. Can you cut it with milk? Or do you have a can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup?|`|zXavPbXfaa	Sure.    I'd even heat the stock on the stove, add some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit and then stir in the cream at the last minute to avoid scorching it.    Should be nice and rich!|`|EMZa78Ydaa	The richness of the gravy will be different, but not bad.  I would recommend cooking the two together first to create a gravy, maybe adding a little roux as well along with some spices.  It would become a gravy most likely better than what the recipe calls for!|`|Q477JhRYaa	No, I would use cream of chix soup it is 98% fat free and it is rich and thick..you'll need to add some water to it though.

xyE4lVcEaa	This is a really good appetizer. It's super easy and tastes really good.    Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Dip    Ingredients:  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter  1/3 cup brown sugar  1 tsp. vanilla extract  1 (8-oz) pkg cream cheese  1/2 cup confectioner's sugar  3/4 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips    Directions:  1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the brown sugar over medium heat. Stir continuously, until the brown sugar dissolves. (You can also do this in the microwave but watch it closely. The butter/sugar mixture will boil over fast. Stir every 30 seconds or so.)  2. Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla extract and set aside to cool.  3. Beat the cream cheese and confectioner's sugar for 1 minute.  4. Slowly beat in the cooled butter mixture and beat again for another minute.  5. Stir in the chocolate chips.  6. Pour into a serving bowl and refrigerate.  7. Garnish with additional chips, if you choose.    *Serve with Nilla wafers or graham crackers.    **Note: after refrigerating the dip it will be pretty solid and un-dippable so make sure to remove it from the refrigerator about 15-30 minutes before you plan on serving it, so it has time to soften up.    Or These are also really good:  --------------------------------------...  Stuffed Strawberries    Ingredients  1 pint fresh strawberries  1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened  1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste  2 tablespoons orange flavored liqueur, or vanilla extract    Directions  Cut the tops off of the strawberries and stand upright on the cut side. Make a cut 3/4 of the way down from the tip of the strawberry towards the bottom.  Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and liqueur until smooth in a mixer or a food processor. Place into a piping bag with a star tip.

Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl.  Blend cream cheese with the sausage. Stuff mushroom caps with the cream cheese and sausage mixture.    Arrange stuffed mushroom caps on a medium baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes and then put under the broiler for 2 minutes to brown.    I added the following changes to the recipe.    I fry up garlic with my sausage and add onion powder to the mixture.    I also melt some butter and mix it with seasoned bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese.

Here are some substitutions I've made that don't compromise taste:    - fat free half-and-half (or milk with a pinch of flour) instead of heavy cream  - use cooking spray rather than oil in pans  - applesauce instead of oil in baking recipes  - low-fat ground turkey instead of ground beef  - whole grains/whole wheat flour instead of white bread/bleached flour  - take extra time to compare nutrition content between similar items at the grocery store  - low-fat frozen yogurt instead of ice cream  - broil, bake, steam or boil instead of oil-fry  - poach meats (pan-fry in 1/4 inch of water) instead of frying  - use spices instead of butter/sour cream to add flavor  - flavor with lemon or lemon-pepper instead of salt  - marinate in fruit/jam instead of oils to add great flavor to chicken, fish, etc.  - make your own salad dressings and dips - use low-fat sour cream or olive oil instead of mayo or less-healthy oil  - put veggies where you normally wouldn't, like in casseroles, lasagna, enchiladas, etc. it makes it more filling while consuming less  - use low-fat or omega-3 margarine instead of butter  - use less meat/oil/lard, etc. than what recipes call for  - purchase a low-fat/healthy cooking cookbook that gives you inspiration    Here's a Web site that provides even more ideas and some great healthy recipes: http://www.cookinglight.com/|`|qkOkKVkOaa	ummm go only on rice or corn.

Make more soups, you can pack them with finely chopped veggies- (broccoli, grated carrot) and the kids wont know. I do the same with any pasta sauce.    Fish is very healthy, you can bread it for the kids, they'll be more likey to eat it that way.    Any salad with grilled chicken breast.    Baked beans are a good side dish they are  full of protien, and most kids will eat them.    Use ground chicken or turkey with is almost 99% fat free, for meat loaf, meatballs, meat sauce.

You can add a bunch of sugar and salt to it to make it not so blah and bland, but that is defeating the purpose.    What I do is have half a serving of the real dessert!

DKdQ7swZaa	Different sized containers all the same diameter but different heights for the often used spices, making the most used the talls and least used the smallest in height. Utilizing a different (lessor) diameter perhaps in an even different row being stored in a head height cabinet. Every cook has spices used more often and those which are there for specific needs and uses. I would think the need for the most often used would give the largest container for that need alone and so forth down to the celery seed for potato salad.... Just a practical thought to an overlooked very practical question.|`|xFv6LirIaa	Just like you said, braille lables are great.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	We use high-fat, high-sugar foods to balance out our hormones during times of chronic stress. When the body is subjected to stress, adrenal glands release certain hormones called glucocorticoids. In immediate-danger situations (like, say, a car crash or extreme physical pain) the amount of glucocorticoids released can eventually crash our stress-response systems. But during periods of chronic stress, the hormones are released at lower level; instead of shutting us down, they drive us to seek out pleasurable foods and accumulate abdominal fat. By doing so, we send an a-OK signal to the brain, which halts the release of any more hormones.    nfd?|`|ofI2ikiuaa	cause you beg for comfort ....  in food|`|43769776f4128a4bec47a0e8a7748039aa	I think like drinking a glass of water before you eat something is good  1st as it kills mostly almost the percentage of your appetite.

mPS2Zccaaa	Scoring means to make slits in the chicken. Ensure they are not too deep or your chicken will turn into a mess. 1/4 to 1/2 an inch should suffice. This will shorten the cooking time and also let any flavoring or seasoning to penetrate the chicken more than just being on the surface.    Good luck!|`|pXWyGLfoaa	What the others have said about scoring with a knife is correct.

Peace be with you.|`|FXIjJwbXaa	It means to mark it with a knife. Take your knife and slice thru just under the skin. Do not do fully through the chicken.

Cut the fish (or chicken) up into bite size pieces. Put the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parmesan into a ziploc bag. Mix the egg and the milk in a good sized bowl and add the fish (or chicken) nuggets to the bowl.     Take the nuggets out of the milk/egg mixture a few at a time and drop into the bag. Shake around until well coated and then place on baking sheet (you can grease it but I usually just line with foil). Do this until they are all coated and bake about 15-20 minutes depending on the size of your nuggets, slightly longer for chicken. They are good!  ----  No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing  1 cup low-fat sour cream (or non fat yogurt)  1/2 cup buttermilk (can substitute non fat milk and 1 tsp white vinegar to make 1/2 cup, let stand for 3 to 5 minutes)  1/2 tsp parsley   1/2 tsp chives   1/2 tsp garlic powder   1/4 tsp dill weed   1/4 tsp onion powder   1/8 tsp salt   1/8 tsp black pepper     Place sour cream and buttermilk into a mixing bowl. Season with parsley, chives, garlic powder, dill, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk together until smooth.     Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.   ----  Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers  3 pounds ground turkey   1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs   1/4 cup finely diced onion (used food processor)  1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper (used food processor)  2 egg whites, lightly beaten   1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley   1 clove garlic, peeled and minced   1 teaspoon seasoning salt   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper   Worcestershire sauce  splash of soy sauce    Optional: Can add slight coating of flour and Montreal Steak Seasoning (McCormick) to the formed patties.    In a large bowl, mix ground turkey, seasoned bread crumbs, onion, egg whites, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper. Form into 12 patties.     Cook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).    They freeze very well.

I used a bit of vegetable bouillon to create a quick broth - the Rapunzel brand (regular with herbs) is a favorite. Soak your beans overnight or at the very least for a few hours before cooking the soup - in a pinch you could conceivably get away with using canned beans.        4 cups water or a mild vegetable stock      2 cups pre-soaked ceci beans (also known as chickpeas or garbanzo beans)      6 ounces fresh or dried pappardelle        1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil      sea salt    Bring the stock and ceci beans to a simmer and cook until the beans are cooked through. Taste and season with salt - you will need more or less depending on how salty your stock (bouillon) is. I wanted my broth to have a bit more body so I scooped out a small handful of cooked beans (20 or so), pureed them with a hand blender, and added them back into the pot -an optional step and not necessary if you opt for a homemade chicken stock which tends to have more body (from the gelatin in the bones)...this was my vegetarian work-around.    While the beans are cooking, boil the pappardelle in well-salted water. Drain and set aside 1/3 of the cooked noodles, you are going to fry these. Also, hang on to a cup (or two) of the pasta water in case you need a bit more liquid for your soup.    Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the reserved noodles and fry them up until they are nice and crispy, don't let the oil get overly hot, it should be nicely fragrant and able to do its crisping job. Just remember, you are going to use it later in the recipe, so you don't want it to get to its smoking point.    Add the boiled-not-fried noodles into the bean pot and taste for seasoning, salt if needed (add in the reserved pasta water here if you want a bit more broth, but I like this soup light on the liquid). Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the olive oil from the skillet into the soup and serve with a generous sprinkling of the fried noodles mixed in at the last minute. A drizzle of your favorite table olive oil is a great way to finish the soup.

If you get a couple jars of Alfredo Sauce from the store and melt some shredded cheddar into it, that will form a nice cheesy cream sauce (I'd add about 1/2 cup milk too) and whisk the cheese into a warmed sauce.  The sauce will be "soupy" but when you mix it with al dente noodles (try shells or farfalle) and into a casserole dish, it will thicken up while baking.  Add some diced chicken breast into it.

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Whoa! There is no reason to  & 39!* and there is no reason to be so uptight about the food you are eating. Slow down and balance out your food choices with 5 a Day Veggies and Fruits. Remember that grain and beans, grain and dairy, grain and nuts and seeds, create protein complementarity. . . i.e. meaning that those foods in combination equals complete protein. Quinoa in a food with all of the essential amino acids present and bio available. You can cook it as a grain or cook up quinoa pasta for the same benefit. It really isn't all that hard. The comfort foods of practically every culture are vegetarian and are comprised of such pairings as: Mac and Cheese, Beans and Rice, Wheat and Chicpeas, Lentils and Barley, Corn and Beans. Dal and Chepattis, Bean Sprouts and Rice, Tofu and Rice, Tempeh and Wheat, PB&J and Milk! etc. etc. Honest, it isn't hard it just requires some consciousness directed upon your food choices. Alos there are all of those faux meat choices -- Tofurky Sausages, Burgers, and Tofu Pups. Faux Cold Cuts and Soy based Fajita Strips. There is nothing wrong with cheese in moderation if you avoid the rennet much of it is made with -- but there are almond Rice and Soy cheeses that are fine. Yogurt. et. Seriously, please stop complaining and go to the Health Food Store and look at what is available to you. Have a little courage and explore the new foods with all the good information you have ever learned about nutrition and balance. Sure you'll get sick if all you eat is bread and cheese. That is an invitation to constipation and disease. . . so balance things out, explore, taste and enjoy the process! You may not like everything you try but don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  Relax and enjoy the process.   But protein isn't the issue -- B12 is the issue. You'll find it in Tempeh. You'll find it in Nutritional Yeast. You'll find it in your Vegetarian Multi Vitamin too.  For really important nutritional information check out www.veg123.com; www.your-vegetarian-kitchen.com, www.goveg.com and also www.vegetariantimes.com. Read cookbooks too. Laurel's Kitchen is a fabulous resource but there are many, many others. But chiefly, relax and have fun!|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Try to focus less on dairy products because they offer little nutritional value. You can get more calcium from vegetables with less calories and fat. I think you need to be consuming A LOT more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains like brown rice or whole wheat bread. You can get protein from things like peanut butter, nuts, soy milk, fruits and vegetables, tofu, seitan, or tempeh. Personally, I would steer away from protein shakes and supplements because they're loaded with chemicals.    Simple recipes are smoothies (frozen fruit, fresh banana, and milk or soy milk).     Brown rice, stir fried vegetables and tofu and soy sauce.     Fresh fruit and nuts are always a great snack, and the fiber in fruit will keep you feeling full for longer.    Just be creative! It IS possible to get everything you need from a vegetarian diet.|`|AA11304025	eat more vegetables and fruit|`|wvsQ9SBcaa	You need to cut out the (bad) carbs, take protein supplements (up the beans and tofu) don't rely fully on milk products to carry you through life. It's VEGetarian for a reason. Fall back on the many VEGetables and fruits out there. Stores like Whole Foods cater to people taking up the vegan and vegetarian lifestyle. You can make all the same dishes just omit the meat and put your own tweak on it :)|`|YCkjPJe8aa	If you aren't loving the vegetarian lifestyle, there are variations on the typical vegetarian diet. For example, my dad calls himself a "Cape Cod Vegetarian" because he eats fish and shell fish. Also, some people only eat white meat. Find what works best for you.    I'm not a vegetarian but my favorite meatless meal is sliced apples with a little bit of peanut butter. Fruit and protein... healthy and tasty(:    hope I helped.

el8yX5q3aa	Honey...why would you want to drink at 15?  Do you realize that starting to drink at that age leads to alcoholism?  Do you not know what that does?     I guess it is like someone smoking and KNOW they are going to get cancer from it and they will risk their life for that damn puff of smoke. WHY?      It is a death wish.  Not only alcoholism...but drinking causes poor judgement and driving while drinking can kill someone ...even yourself...there are many problems with it.  MANY HEALTH ISSUES later on in life...because many times it doesn't stop at one drink.  Your body and age are too young to expose it to that stuff.    Why not put that energy into romancing a girl and letting her know what a stand up guy you are and that you can be trusted and depended on and you are rock solid?    Look to the future honey...not your 15 year old hormones and instant gratification needs to prove you are getting independent of mom and dad....    You are a kid only once...enjoy it....you can be an adult all your life.....and it is hard work and full of rocky roads.  THAT CAN WAIT...enjoy your life now.    And to those that say it is only once a week or occasionally..you do not know his family history or his medical make up.  You do not know that one beer will not turn into two..or three and become a regular thing.     How do you think addictions start?  FULL BLOWN?  NO they sneak up on you......so why tempt it.???      These are children talking...I am an alcohol drug therapist....don't do it.  Wait until you are an adult and can make those decisions and make them more wisely.|`|C6vdxxjKaa	Course its fine to drink     i live in the UK as well and i started having the occasional drink when i was about 12.     now i drink most weeks and i mean like a bottle of vodka and im 17    some of my mates when we go out have up to 8 cans of beer and this is on a regular basis!     u will b fine and don't listen to people who say don't drink just have fun.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	I don't think you need to start early, but realistically, no, doing what you said will probably not pose any risk to your health.|`|AA11828439	It is not legal or intelligent. At 15 your body has not finished growing and you risk severe liver damage.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Legally you are not allowed because of your age and it can get you in serious trouble.  Underage drinking carries tickets, hefty fines and a host of other annoying circumstances.    Health-wise, since you stated that you may have one beer seldomly, you are not at risk of any major damages to the liver and/or kidneys.       I wouldn't recommend it.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	omg these people are ridiculous.  One beer every 4 months?  That's practically nothing.  It's fine.

DONT GIVE IN!!!|`|AA11706291	For starters you have to have the alcohol with a meal to make it legal.    You should not consume any alcohol just on its own when you are a minor as it will damage your liver much more then it would when you are an adult. This will set you up for sirosis of the liver at a younger age if when you are older you start to drink large amounts or just small amounts frequently.|`|ph4Htg02aa	No.|`|LqLs6otzaa	Hmm.  Are you ok with the fact that you might become an alcoholic, and not be able to control how many beers you have?

Sensible drinking does not lead to alcoholism- subjective emotive phrases such as "every alcoholic starts with one drink" are as relevant as "every bulimic starts with one meal".     Even Jesus drank wine! (although the fundamentalists will try to deny it)|`|Az7y2wMRaa	wtf? im from the uk and the legal drinking age for beer and all alcoholic beverages is 18.. unless you are ordering it with a meal with the supervision of your parents - then i think its actually 14 anyway.    the odd beer wouldn't do you any harm; in most european countries you can drink beer from younger than you are. your liver is more easily damaged than an adults though, so moderation is important.|`|us6s78pWaa	I would say that it's probably healthier than eating a Twinky or any other food made by Hostess, Little Debbie, or Drake's. Just saying, it's not really bad for you, and definitely much less harmful than most other things that people consume.|`|0kTbs879aa	Depends on if you can hold your liquor. Having a beer every now and then isnt going to kill you unless you do something very stupid after you drank it. I dont suggest someone so young start drinking because one becomes several and before you know it your a raging alcoholic. So if you do decide to have JUST ONE ever 4-5 months just be safe about it.|`|n6deQ4n4aa	honestly one won't kill you niether will two or three.

You can only have one beer with a meal with parental consent with a meal in the uk, you cannot purchase beer yourself until you are 18 and it is illegal for someone else to buy the beer for you. However, if you are only drinking one beer every once in a while then you should be fine. There are not many health considerations for having the occasional drink of alcohol. Just be safe when and where you do it and know your limits. Well done for being sensible!|`|hldaLhKkaa	No, it wouldn't be so bad, but don't tell ur mom I said so! lol|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	If you are having a beer in the frequency that you have actually stated, NO.  You will do no damage whatsoever.  However, if you and your mates are getting pissed up frequently, then yes, you'll do damage.    In most cultures, wine or beer with a meal is perfectly acceptable and heaven forbid, we actually teach responsible drinking.  You only need to stay away from two things - the extreme people that tell you to drink until you puke and the other extreme people that say you'll die if you sniff one bottle cap.

5zNwBQZHaa	Not really.  Kind of a greasy sweet egg.  It might not set up with all that butter.    Flour is used to give a baked product some structure - but you need something in there that will cause it to rise, like baking powder.    If you have any baking powder, try adding a teaspoon to the one with the flour and you might end up with a flat eggy pancake like thing.      You have all the basic ingredients of a cake (minus the flavoring such as vanilla and the baking powder) but the proportions are off.      I hope I don't spoil your experimentation if I give the recipe for basic cake.  This doesn't have flavoring in it (usually vanilla) but it does have sweetener.  But this will give you an idea of what would be needed, at the minimum, to make cake:     1/2 c. butter  1 c. sugar  2 eggs  1 1/4 c. flour  1 tsp. baking powder    Mix butter and sugar. Add eggs; mix well. Add flour and baking powder; mix well. Bake in 350 degree oven approximately 25 minutes (8x8 pan)|`|mlmSRkhGaa	It will end up like a baked sweet egg.

A8F4HF3Paa	Well, the nature of being a vegetarian means you don't eat meat.  So things you would eat instead would be:    salads, soups, tofu, beans, eggs, cheese, peanut butter, pancakes, breads-- anythign that doesn't have meat in it (chicken, beef, pork, fish).|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	It all depends on your definition of 'vegetarian'. As I define it, it means no meat, fish, fowl, game or eggs or the juices thereof.   Everything else - grain, beans, peas, legumes, nuts and seeds, fruit and vegetables, dairy and other milks (soy, rice, hemp, almond), honey, agave, molasses, Vegan Organic Cane Sugar, Barley Malt, Rice Syrup, Maple Syrup etc. are all AOK. Tofu, Tempeh, Seitan and Faux Meat products like Tofu Pups, Boca Burgers, Tofurky Sausages, Lightlife Chili and Sausage (among other things) are all AOK.

Actually, fish-only eaters are called Pescitarians, (prob speeled wrong).  vegans don't eat ANYTHING from an animal (milk, eggs, cheese) which is hard for a teen like me 2 do.  so. a vegetarian does NOT eat anything that 'had a face' cows, pigs, chickens, and in most cases fish.|`|91n9qpkdaa	no meat, chicken, eggs, fish, animal enzymes, rennet, or gelatin|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	A lot has already been said.

bv5kbxvUaa	Burrebrede (Scottish shortbread)   This is a medieval Scottish shortbread recipe. It has been a holiday favorite for my family and friends for years. The shortbread keeps very well in an airtight tin or tightly wrapped in tinfoil.      *   1/2 cup superfine sugar      * 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon      * 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom      * 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger      * 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice      * 1/2 teaspoon salt      * 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour      * 1 cup butter, softened     1.   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).     2. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, allspice and salt. Divide into two equal parts, and set one aside. Add the flour and butter to the other half, and stir until blended. It should be slightly grainy.     3. Press the dough evenly into an 8 inch square pan. Cut into 1x2 inch pieces using a knife, and prick with the tines of a fork. This will keep the shortbread from warping while baking. Sprinkle the reserved sugar and spice liberally over the top, brushing into all of the cuts and holes.     4. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden at the edges. Do not brown. Cool completely in the pan, and break into pieces along the lines to serve.  Tip  This recipe is really designed to be baked in a shortbread pan which I highly recommend.|`|1577a1ef7a5596b228d3cc0ac8dfdc51aa	No|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	http://www.christmas-cookies.com/recipes...    is this what you were looking for?    sorry thats all i could find searching scottish winter cookies! hope you find what you are looking for!

That is why it's good that we humans have such a good immune system.  There are times when that system fails or is weakened.  You could become ill if exposed to salmonella when in a weakened state, but even so, it is very very rare to die of it.

ynjrtIdUaa	Let your steak reach room temperature before cooking. This allows the steak to cook more evenly and faster.  Fat shrinks faster than the meat and it can cause your steaks to curl, so trim anything thicker than 1/4".  Find a seasoning you like, maybe starting with some cracked pepper and some celery salt.  Preheat the broiler.   A rare steak will be soft. A medium steak will be firm but yielding. A well steak will be firm. Only turn once. Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes before serving. This will let the juices flow out from the center so the whole steak is nice and juicy.   Here are some cooking times by thickness (divide times in half for each side.)    Thickness     Rare      Medium      Well   1"                 8-10       12-14        16-20   1 1/2"          10-14       16-20        22-26   2                 12-16       18-22        24-28|`|DKdQ7swZaa	Broiled 1 1/4 inch thick rib eye steaks (rare- medium rare)  Place the steaks with only sea salt on the side going up (facing) the fire on the top (closest to the fire) rack height. Always be watching for possible fat caused (flare-up) fires. In about three to four minutes when an edge of the steaks start charring a little, turn over the steaks and add all your other seasonings (this seasoning should have taken a minute) Turn off the broiler in two and a half minutes take them out and serve first side cooked up. But, by leaving them in the broiler and adding 30 seconds to increase doneness to medium rare and then another 30 seconds to medium) If you want well done use top sirloin.    Never forget about possible fatty caused flare ups!

Then put it in the oven at 450 - for a thick steak 6 mins should be medium.|`|CQww1c2daa	You can put it in the broiler.   As it darkens, you turn it over and get the other side dark.  Don't leave it in too long as it sounds like you like it rare.
PenbhD1uaa	Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical pasta of Italian origin.[1] A variety of pasta dishes are based on it, from spaghetti with cheese and pepper or garlic and oil to a spaghetti with tomato, meat, and other sauces. Spaghetti is made of semolina and water.    Chinese noodles pre-date Italian pasta, and Arab traders probably became introduced to them due to their trade routes with China. Historically, people in Italy ate pasta in the form of gnocchi-like dumplings  pasta fresca eaten as soon as it was prepared. It has now been asserted that the Muslims who populated Southern Italy (around the 12th Century) were the first to develop the innovation of working pasta from grain into thin long forms, capable of being dried out and stored for months or years prior to consumption (see Peter Robb's Midnight in Sicily pp 94-96 for details). Or Muslim traders with links to Arab trade routes to china, may have been introduced to pasta or noodles that way. Legend has it that Cicero, the famous Roman orator was fond of "laganum," an ancient tagliatelle. The Saracens, originally from North Africa, invaded southern Italy in the 9th century and occupied Sicily for 200 years. Pasta is now associated with Italians as a whole. The popularity of pasta spread to the whole of Italy after the establishment of pasta factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of pasta for the Italian market.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Actually, I think pasta originally came from China|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	It doesn't.    Mine comes from Safeway.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Not all spaghetti comes from Rome; but some might.

hHCdXq0Naa	They'll definitely be spicy - or at least VERY salty!  You could cut them into strips and stir-fry with the broccoli and other veggies and serve over the rice .... or grill the chicken and serve with steamed broccoli & rice|`|zu0W6hCTaa	oven bake|`|53giV6PFaa	I would bake them, they'll stay moister that way and frying them may scorch a sugar-based sauce like teriyaki and that doesn't taste very good at all.

If I was to do them in strips then I would marinate them in good thickish style strips. You could if you wanted to kick it up, add some Hoi Sin, or some really hot red chili chopped up. Basically the marinade is what I use minus the terriyaki. but I add oyster and Kraft BBQ Sauce. I marinade over night. For finger foods grilledor BBQ, I use this process for wings and drumsticks.    Good luck|`|I7Ee17s0aa	I make a very easy chicken teriyaki on occasion by marinating chicken breasts cut into chunks or strips in teriyaki sauce, then sauteeing up sliced onions, carrots, celery, and pineapple chunks along with the chicken and serving it over rice.

U3ZBUOWaaa	This is more like a candy but we make these a lot as they go so fast:    Chocolate Oatmeal drop Cookies (No baking)    2 cups sugar  1 stick butter (1/2 cup)  1/2 cup evaporated milk  1 teaspoon vanilla  2 1/2 tablespoons cocoa  1/2 cup peanut butter  3 cups oats    In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients except peanut butter and oats and cook over medium heat. Let boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter and oats.    Spoon out quickly onto wax paper or aluminum foil. Cookies will harden as they set.    And this is our favorite for baked cookies...they are soft and chocolately!!    Chocolate Drop Cookies  SOFT CHOCOLATE DROP COOKIES       1/2 c. shortening  1 c. brown sugar  2 squares melted chocolate  1/4 tsp. vanilla  2 eggs, beaten  1 3/4 c. flour  1/2 tsp. soda  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 c. milk  1/2 c. nuts, if desired    Cream shortening and sugar thoroughly; add chocolate, eggs and vanilla, mixing well. Sift dry ingredients together and add alternately with milk, ending with dry ingredients. Add nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake in a moderate 350 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. Cool, then frost. Let this batter set a few minutes before you start baking the cookies. They are better if you make small cookies.|`|53giV6PFaa	Chocolate Chip is the classic drop cookie :-)    I have made this many times and this is my favorite recipe so far for a very good chewy cookie. The original recipe was a high-rated recipe from allrecipes.com, but I changed it a bit after a few tries that made it even better.    BIG FAT CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES    2 cups all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon salt  3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted  3/4 cup packed brown sugar  1/2 cup white sugar  1 tablespoon vanilla extract  1 egg  1 egg yolk  2 cups semisweet chocolate chips -- I also made this with 1 cup M&M's and 1 cup chocolate chips.    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.    Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.    In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Refridgerate cookie dough for about 20-30 minutes first. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. (Put dough in fridge between batches.)    Bake for 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. Don't worry about the middles looking a little gooey - they will cook more while sitting on the baking sheet. This way your cookies will be chewy.    Watch the time carefully - a minute is all it takes to have a crunchy cookie (still good) over a chewy one.|`|DqTO1dBVaa	Pumpkin Drop Cookies (yummy)    3/4 C butter (room temp)  1 C brown sugar  1 lg egg  1 C canned pumpkin  1 t vanilla  2 1/2 C flour  1 t baking soda  2 t baking powder  1/2 t salt  1 t cinnamon  1/2 C chopped nuts (opt)  1/2 C raisins (opt) --- I dont use nuts or raisins  Mix wet ingredients & sugar with mixer.

The center of the cocoa bean is ground into a liquid, called the liquor (there is NO alcohol in this!).    Cocoa Butter  It's not really a butter, but the fat extracted from the chocolate liquor.     Cocoa Powder  Cocoa powder is the solid left after the cocoa butter is pressed out of the liquor. Cocoa powder often undergoes a Dutch Process, that reduces its natural acidity. Dutch cocoa is milder tasting and blends better with milk.     Unsweetened Chocolate  This is the solid form of chocolate liquor. Unsweetened chocolate is often used in baking.     Bittersweet Chocolate  Chocolate with a minimum of 50% chocolate liquor.     Semi-Sweet Chocolate  Chocolate with a minimum of 35% chocolate liquor.     Dark Chocolate  Also known as 'sweet chocolate'. It only contains 15% liquor, as well as sweeteners and cocoa butter.    Milk Chocolate  Milk chocolate has at least 10% liquor and 12% milk solids. Sugar, cocoa butter and vanilla are also mixed in.     White Chocolate  This kind lacks the brown color because there are no cocoa solids. White chocolate is made up of only cocoa butter, sugar and milk solids.|`|2RWayH3Oaa	Agreed Godiva is the best, the dark solid cocolate is my fav.

xHU8vtZraa	Yes, Polish/Norwegian food is bland. Some good dishes are:    White Trout Wth Raspberry sauce.    Cook White trout    While cooking take 4 ounces of raspberries, 8 ounces of cranberry juice, and half of a pitted peach and throw into a pot bringing it to a full boil. When it gets to a full boil turn off and let it cool down; then throw it into a blender and blend it till smooth. Add: some salt and white pepper to the sauce. When trout is done take out and let cool. Put trout on plate with side dish and drizzle with raspberry sauce.  That was one recipe.         Pierogi  2 1/2     cups flour  1/2     teaspoon salt  1     egg  2     teaspoons oil  3/4     cup warm water  1.  Potato and Cheese Filling: Cook the onion in butter until tender.  2.  Combine it with potatoes and cheese.  3.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  4.  Vary the proportions and ingredients in this recipe to suit your taste.  5.  Mix the flour with the salt in a deep bowl.  6.  Add the egg, oil and water to make a medium soft dough.  7.  Knead on a floured board until the dough is smooth.  8.  Caution: Too much kneading will toughen the dough.  9.  Divide the dough into 2 parts.  10.  Cover and let stand for at least 10 minutes.  11.  Prepare the filling.  12.  The filling should be thick enough to hold its shape.  13.  Roll the dough quite thin on a floured board.  14.  Cut rounds with a large biscuit cutter, or the open end of a glass.  15.  Put the round in the palm of your hand.  16.  Place a spoonful of filling in it, fold over to form a half circle and press the edges together with the fingers.  17.  The edges should be free of filling.  18.  Be sure the edges are sealed well to prevent the filling from running out.  19.  Place the pierogi on a floured board or tea towel and then cover with another tea towel to prevent them from drying out.  20.  COOKING: Drop a few pierogies into a large quantity of rapidly boiling salted water.  21.  Do not attempt to cook too many at a time.  22.  Stir VERY gently with a wooden spoon to separate them and to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  23.  Continue boiling for 3-4 minutes.  24.  The cooling period will depend upon the size you made it, the thickness of the dough and the filling.  25.  Pierogies will be ready when they are puffed.  26.  Remove them with a perforated spoon or skimmer to a colander and drain thoroughly.  27.  Place in a deep dish, sprinkle generously with melted butter to prevent them from sticking.  28.  Cover and keep them hot until all are cooked.  29.  Serve in a large dish without piling or crowding them.  30.  Top with melted butter- chopped crisp bacon and/or chopped onions lightly browned in butter.  31.  REHEATING: One of the great things about pierogies, is that they can be made in large quantities, refrigerated, frozen and reheated without lost of quality.  32.  Many prefer reheated pierogies as compared to freshly boiled ones.  33.  To re-heat, you can: 1) pan fry pierogies in butter or bacon fat until they are light in color or, 2) heat the pierogies in the top of a double boiler or in the oven until they are hot and plump or, 3) deep fry them.

YupMCYHlaa	Celery grows in a bunch of 'stalks' or 'ribs'.  If you know what it looks like you should have no problem finding it.  I'm guessing a 'head' is one of these bunches.  Just look at them to make sure they look fresh and crisp.    There's another vegetable that's called 'celery', which is a root, it looks something like a turnip but not as smooth and white.  You peel the skin off and its like a turnip inside.  That is shaped more like a 'head' but I doubt that's what they meant.  It's also called celeriac or 'celery root'.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	They are usually sold in bunches (heads usually refers to something round like cabbage or lettuce), but I guess two packages of celery would be what they want.

Wray and Nephew (Jamaica)  Cruzan (USVI)  Pyrat (Anguilla)  Rom Zacapa (Guatemalla)    A word on Capt Morgan: Capt Morgan is the Kool-Aid of rum. I can't even believe they call it rum. Just another example of how effective a massive marketing machine is at bamboozling America's misguided and media-impressionable youth, kind of like with Jagermeister.    Good beers:  Dos Equis Amber, Yuengling, Foster's, and Miller Lite.|`|e0EG293naa	Nothing like an ice cold beer.  I like Full Moon's Seasonal Ale.

7NoModJ1aa	As long as you eat healthy vegetarian foods and get about the same amount of calories, you shouldn't lose too much weight. Whole grains are great for being calorie dense yet healthy, and be sure that you get good sources of protein like beans as well. A lot of the faux meats like veggie burgers and veggie dogs have quite a bit of protein and calories, so you can use those to transition until you are comfortable with using different ingredients in your meals.    As for stopping cold turkey or doing it gradually, I stopped eating meat right away, and I didn't have any negative effects. It's really up to the person though. Sometimes going gradually makes it easier to stick to, and you have more time to get used to the new foods you will be eating. Stopping gradually just didn't work for me personally.    Either way, best of luck!!|`|zfxJHXM8aa	do it cold turkey. its really not that hard its not like quitting smoking. You might loose a little weight at first but you should gain what you lost back once you get the diet down. WELCOME TO THE FAMILY! you will start to feel great!   You can also start out just doing the PETA 30 day pledge to be Veg... they send you tips and you have a calendar that helps you out.|`|AA11811031	A lot of meat contains a lot of fat so cutting in out of you diet can be healthy, but may not result in weight loss.   It depends on everything else you eat as well.  I have slowly been going vegetarian for the last year or so, but not on purpose.  I started by cooking less meat, and now that i buy all my own food i do not buy meat, but I will still eat it if someone gives it to me.  I think it all depends on your motivation for going vegetarian,
rsTB7D1zaa	It isn't legally required on beer.  Probably a relic from the time most beer was 5% so they never bothered to legislate that they print the alcoholic content.  Most of the ones that do print it, did you notice they were usually much higher than 5%?  In my beer collection I have many that are over 7%, and almost all say that.|`|1577a1ef7a5596b228d3cc0ac8dfdc51aa	Some are too embarrassed to list theirs.

They are awesome and sooo easy.      1  cup  peanut butter, creamy or crunchy   1  cup  sugar, or 1 1/3 cup sugar replacement (recommended: Splenda)   1 egg   1  teaspoon  vanilla extract       Directions:    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a large baking sheet.    In a mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, 1 cup equivalent of the Splenda, the egg, and vanilla, and stir well with a spoon. Roll the dough into balls the size of walnuts. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet. With a fork, dipped in Splenda to prevent sticking, press a crisscross design on each cookie. Bake for 12 minutes, remove from the oven, and sprinkle the cookies with some of the remaining Splenda. Cool slightly before removing from pan.    Yield: 18 cookies   Prep time: 10-15 minutes   Inactive prep time: 3-5 minutes   Cook time: 12 minutes   Ease of preparation: easy|`|0Elxt7Yxaa	Here are 3 simple recipes to bake with kids:    http://hubpages.com/hub/Baking-With-Kids...|`|cfKXshe3aa	these cookies are so moist and good you can change the cake mix flavor to yellow if you want:   one package of deep chocolate cake mix    half a cup of oil   one-fourth of a cup of water   one egg   one cup of chocolate chips   it is super easy and results are delicous!!! your kids will have a blast makes 2 dozens    best of luck- Jackiee

There are lots of recipes for this.    Choose your favorite flavor of sugar-free jello, and add some fresh fruit.  If you can't get fresh, thaw out some frozen fruit and add it.  You can get some good blueberries, peaches, etc. in the frozen food section.  Blueberries are great--lots of protein, which wrestlers need!  (Don't use Dole, though... their frozen fruit is often a little too hard.)  Be sure you don't use canned fruit or anything with sugar added.  Just fruit.    If you want to add something creamy, you can top the jello/fruit bowl with a little nonfat vanilla yogurt.  yum!    Lastly, if it's still not sweet enough, drizzle some honey on it.  Honey is good for you, and fewer calories than sugar.      If you don't like jello, you could just do the fruit and yogurt.      There are other tricks... if he has a few calories to play with, you could try "No Pudge" brownies.  This is a mix you buy in the baking aisle.  You just add no-fat yogurt.  They have about 100 calories per brownie, no fat, and are absolutely delicious.    Good luck!|`|PenbhD1uaa	Coconut Poppy Seed Cake   1 cup all purpose flour  1/4 cup poppy seeds  3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut - packed lightly  1 tsp baking powder  3 large eggs  3/4 cup sugar  1/2 cup vegetable oil  1/2 tsp salt  1 cup fat free yogurt -Greek style preferred      Butter and flour a 9 inch spring form pan.

5zNwBQZHaa	I remember asking myself this same question back in the 80's when the B-52s came out with their song "rock lobster!"  :-)    What we are used to seeing in the fish shop or served whole as lobster - is called Claw or Clawed Lobster.  Of course - the big feature of those is the huge front claws they have.  A lot of people like to pick the meat out of the claws saying it is better than the tail meat.  I don't have a preference - they are both good.    Rock Lobster is an entirely different species - not even closely related to the Claw Lobster.  Rock's don't have the big Claws in front, in fact, they don't have claws at all - just thin legs.     Rock's may also be called Spiny Lobster.      Check out the these articles for pictures of the two different lobsters and you can tell the difference easily:    Spiny Lobster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_lobst...    Claw Lobster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster|`|sDKCX43caa	Rock lobsters tend to be smaller.
oVxr5B3Eaa	That link doesn't work for me but I'm guessing it's the map that tells you who calls it what, where?   Because before I read past the title thats what i was going to link you to.

In the south east it's "Coke" (because coca cola started in florida so it's the local word), and the south west seems to be soda if i do remember.

bv5kbxvUaa	Having those items is not necessary; you simply have to remember that the key to Risotto is moisture but to make sure it doesn't get sticky. Some people find this tricky. It's simple actually. You must have something for flavor since you said no onions. So you can use garlic and fresh herbs are best. Put a few tablespoons of butter in the pan and sliced garlic about 4 or 5 cloves, then add about 1and 1/2 cups uncoooked long grain rice and saute until browned, then add enough chicken stock (not water) to cover rice then when this is soaked up add the stock in small amounts until the rice looks puffy...then add your choice of fresh herbs such as flat leaf parsley, basil, marjoram.etc. and pepper to taste|`|PPyMhRJAaa	Gorgonzola and bacon risotto -   ingredients        * 3 tbsp olive oil      * 2 shallots, finely chopped (just leave these out as they are similar to onions)      * 275g risotto rice      * 100ml dry white wine      * 850ml chicken stock, hot      * 2 rindless smoked bacon rashers, chopped      * 75g Gorgonzola, cubed      * 2 tbsp crme fra?che      * salt and freshly ground black pepper    preparation method       1.   Heat the oil in a deep frying pan. Add the shallots and cook over a low heat for 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until the grains become translucent and have absorbed most of the oil.     2.   Pour in the wine and stir constantly until it is absorbed. Add sufficient hot stock to just cover the rice, stir, and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed, stirring occasionally. Repeat this process two or three times until the stock is used up.     3.   Meanwhile, gently cook the bacon in a frying pan or grill until crispy.     4.   Stir the Gorgonzola and crme fraiche into the risotto. Grind over some pepper and taste to check the seasoning. Scatter over the bacon and serve immediately.|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	Cold chicken and pepper risotto?

Add the walnuts and salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze the two whole lemons and extra virgin and stir well. Lastly add the rice and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.  5.

It has to have those ingredients in it - if you change it then you may as well just call it savoury rice. Look online I am sure google might have some useful hints and tips.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	The classic Risotto is anyway without these ingredients. As long as you follow the basic rules you can add what you want.    Risotto Milanese    To produce generous portions for six people, you will need around 450 grams of a superfino short-grain such as arborio or carnaroli, 50 grams of unsalted butter, 1.5 litres of fresh beef stock (alternatively, use a good powdered stock such as bouillon), 100 grams of beef marrow sourced from the local butcher, ( if you cant get it leave it out)  , three strands of saffron dissolved in a little warm water, 50 grams of parmigiano .    Take a good-size saut pan or skillet and melt the butter on a low heat until it is nutty brown in colour. Add the marrow, finely chopped to the pan, cook for a further two to three minutes, then pour the rice into the pan, stirring to coat the grains in the fat.    Add one or two ladles of stock to the rice, ensure the heat is as low as possible, and allow to simmer slowly, resisting the attention to stir as this will only damage the grains of rice, thereby releasing too much starch and making it stodgy.      When the rice has absorbed the liquid, repeat the ladelling process, adding the saffron and the water it infused in. The whole process of absorption/ladelling should take between 15 and 20 minutes. Test the rice - if it still retains a slight bite, then it is ready.    Working quickly, add the parmigiano, adjust for seasoning,  Transfer the rice to bowls and serve immediately. For an extra touch of northern Italian decadence, the risotto could be garnished with a couple of shavings of parmigiano and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.          From there add what you like..preferable right in the beginning. Chicken liver, meat, vegetables...|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Omit the 1/2 onion. Don't do the prawn or mushroom version.     RISOTTO    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS    2 cloves of garlic  ? an onion   100g (? of a 400g tin) of plum tomatoes*   1 tablespoon of olive oil  250g of minced beef, chopped chicken, prawns, mushrooms or frozen mixed vegetables   125g (125ml by volume) of arboreo rice**  1 tablespoon of dried mixed herbs  1 beef, chicken or vegetable stock cube***  250ml of water    METHOD    Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion, cut it in half, chop one half into tiny pieces and save the other half.    Open the tin of tomatoes. Put the juice into a bowl. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (its easier than chasing them around the bowl). Put the chopped tomatoes into the bowl. Use 100g and save the other 300g.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the mince, chicken, prawns, mushrooms or vegetables. Fry for another 3 to 4 minutes, until any meat is an even colour, with no pink bits.     Add the rice and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the herbs and tomatoes. Crumble the stock cube into the water. Add some of the stock to the pan. Mix thoroughly. Add some more of the stock to the pan. Mix thoroughly. Repeat this until all of the stock has been added to the pan.     Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils, for another 20 to 25 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked. If it looks like it is getting dry, add some more water and stir.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Substitute 125ml of white wine for 125ml of the water. You can use left-over cooked chicken, but add it at the same time after all the stock has been added.      TIPS    This dish needs an eye keeping on it all the time to make sure that it cooks properly but stays moist.     * Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped. It is difficult to stick chopped tomatoes back together again if you need to use them whole.     ** It might just say Risotto Rice on the packet.     *** If using prawns, use either a chicken or vegetable stock cube.|`|PenbhD1uaa	I'm not a huge fan of those ingredients (except onions) in risotto either.  here's two really good recipes.

GOOD LUCK!!!!!     1 pound winter squash (about 1/2 of a good-size butternut, for example), such as butternut, banana or hubbard, peeled, seeded and cut in 1/2 inch dice  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  7 to 8 cups vegetable or chicken stock, as needed  2 large garlic cloves, minced or pressed  Salt to taste  1 1/2 cups Arborio or Carnaroli rice  1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc  1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage  1 to 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 to 1/2 cup), to taste  3 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  Freshly ground pepper    1. Preheat the oven to 425oF. Cover a baking sheet with foil. Toss the squash with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and spread it on the baking sheet in an even layer. Place in the oven and roast for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until tender and caramelized. Remove from the heat.    2. Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan.    3. Heat the remaining oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan or a wide saucepan add one third of the squash, the garlic, and about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant about 1 minute, and add the rice. Cook, stirring, until the grains of rice are separate.    3. Stir in the wine and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. The wine should bubble, but not too quickly. When the wine has just about evaporated, stir in a ladleful or two of the simmering stock, enough to just cover the rice and squash. The stock should bubble slowly. Cook, stirring often, until the liquid is just about absorbed. Add the sage and another ladleful of the stock, and continue to cook in this fashion, not too fast and not too slowly, adding more stock when the rice is almost dry, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked al dente. Taste and adjust seasonings.    4. Add the remaining roasted squash and another 1/2 cup of stock to the rice. Stir in the Parmesan and parsley, and immediately remove from the heat. Add freshly ground pepper, taste one last time and adjust salt. The rice should be creamy. Serve at once      ____________________________________    Champagne Risotto        * 4 thin slices prosciutto      * 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth      * 12 asparagus spears, cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces      * 2 tablespoons butter, divided      * 3/4 cup Arborio rice or medium-grain white rice      * 3/4 cup Dry Champagne      * 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano      * 1/8 teaspoon salt      * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper    Directions    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.    Place the 4 slices of prosciutto on a lightly greased baking sheet.    Bake until the prosciutto slices are almost completely crisp, about 6 to 8 minutes. The slices will crisp up even more as they cool. Reserve for garnish.    In a medium saucepan, bring the 3 cups of chicken stock to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer. Blanch the asparagus in the chicken stock for 2 minutes. Remove the asparagus with a slotted spoon. Set the asparagus aside and keep the chicken stock at a low simmer.    In another medium saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the 3/4 cup of Arborio rice and stir to coat in the butter. Continue toasting the rice, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes more.    Add the 3/4 cups of Champagne and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.    Add 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of broth to absorb before adding the next,    until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes total or until you use the 3 cups of chicken broth. Remove from the heat. Gently stir in the asparagus, remaining butter, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.    Spoon the risotto into serving dishes and garnish by breaking the crisp prosciutto into smaller pieces over the top of the risotto. Serve immediately.    This recipe is written for only two servings. I think if you were serving it with several other items you could possibly get four small servings out of this recipe, but if you are feeding any more than four people I would definitely double this recipe. Both Forrest and I really enjoyed this dish. Forrest remarked that it tasted like a casserole because of the creaminess and the different ingredients mixed into the rice. This is most assuredly not a recipe you can walk away from during cooking. Risotto is a very needy dish (ok, I know dishes can't be needy, but if they could then this dish would call all the time and show up uninvited and constantly be looking for attention). From the second you start preparing it, you are tied to the stove. You can't walk off to answer the phone, go to the ba

lUe4rReZaa	Not usually, lots of people bake pies after they cook the turkey on thanksgiving with out it affecting the taste, but It is easier and less fuss to bake the pie ahead of time, and let it cool a bit,  you can warm it in the oven or microwave later if you want too.

lpeHQj3aaa	Spaghetti is less fattening than Mac and cheese, of course, a spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti and meatballs are more fattening than the regular spaghetti w/ tomato sauce - but not more fattening than mac&cheese.

LVHtKIaeaa	Vodka can be made from anything containing any kind of (simple or complex) sugar.  You'll need to ferment whatever you're using as your source material, then distill it.  To do the latter, you'll need a still.  Also, doing so (distillation) is illegal in most parts of the world, with the notable exception of New Zealand.|`|tL5vlITcaa	"i know you can make vodka from potato so waht are the things i need to make it"   A potato some things you can find in a kitchen and some basic knowledge in biochemistry.      "Can you really !?"  You can make alcohol from pretty much any organic matter.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	you can make alcohol form pretty much any organic material.  it's not hard.  if you are mostly interested in getting a really strong end product and don't care much about the taste, mix sugar and water, add some yeast, put an airlock on it, and let it ferment, once it's stopped bubbling, it's done, if you want to make it stronger you would have to distill it.  distilling alcohol is illegal in america, but stills are legal to purchase and own.  or you could build one yourself.  if you're not pretty handy it'll be easier and cheaper to buy one.  the moron who said it's way too hard is stupid and doesn't know what he's talking about.  if you can cook you can distill alcohol.  just be sure to read and know what you're getting into before you decide to do anything|`|dbf8f89019b08a798ede0466478b64e5aa	Can you really !?  Wicked .x|`|PCsW0gbPaa	It's actually illegal in the United States.    You could make a really disgusting beer out of potatoes by grinding them up and cooking them in water over heat with some enzymes (from either human saliva or malted barley).  Then you would strain out the solids, add yeast and allow the juice to ferment into beer.  Then you would put that beer into your still to extract and concentrate the alcohol.    But a still is not easy to make.  And, as I mentioned, it is illegal to use in the US so good luck trying to buy one.  All in all, it is far too complicated of a process to do as a hobby.
YdjX5fOWaa	I freeze bread all the time.  The trick is to make sure that air isn't getting into the bag.  So wrap it up really well.  It'll last a couple months in there.  During the summer, I also refrigerate my bread due to humidity making it mold easily.  It will last weeks.  It eventually gets stale or dry, but it's not gonna hurt you.  That's when I turn it into croutons, bread crumbs for cooking, or a good bread pudding - french toast too!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It should only be refrigerated a week or so - and your jelly should also be refrigerated!

The money raised by this tax goes to the West Virginia University School of Medicine.

West Virginia law requires that an  outline of the state be inscribed in a 1/4 inch circle on the can end.  The State of West Virginia now allows soft drink distributors who are  bonded in the state to ink-jet the tax information on the bottoms of  cans.

How about a nice quiche, with ham and mushroom, bacon and onion, the list is endless.  Brown onion and mince, then add mushrooms, before adding a pint of stock - thicken with gravy salt or cornflour - pour into a casserole dish.  Then use 4oz self raising, with a teaspoon of Bicarb, crumble in a vegetable stock cube then add 1 oz butter to make a breadcrumb texture to your mix.  Add 2 tablespoons of milk and 1 egg, then mix your dough and simply drop it on top of your mince mixture and cook the lot.  A delicious mince cobbler.

They all have pics and are made by real people as they come from blogs.  http://www.tastespotting.com/search/egg/...        Southwestern Egg Casserole  18 eggs  4 oz. can diced green chiles (Anaheim chiles, not jalapenos)  14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes, very well drained  (I recommend Muir Glen or Dei Fratelli organic tomatoes)  Spike Seasoning to taste, about 2 tsp. for me  12 oz. grated cheese (I use low-fat sharp cheddar or Four cheese Mexican Blend, also low-fat)  2-3 T thinly sliced green onions (optional but good)  Sour cream, for serving (I use light sour cream)  Salsa, for serving    Preheat oven to 375 F. Open tomatoes and place in colander placed in the sink to drain. Spray 9" X 12" glass casserole dish with nonstick spray or olive oil.    In large bowl, beat eggs until well-combined, then mix in well-drained tomatoes, green chiles with any juice, and Spike seasoning. Put cheese in bottom of casserole dish . Sprinkle with green onions if using, then pour egg mixture over. (I like to take a fork and gently mix so all the cheese is well distributed in the egg.)    Bake uncovered 40-45 minutes, or until eggs are well set and top is starting to brown slightly. Serve casserole hot with a dollop of sour cream on top and a few spoonfuls of salsa on top.    Egg casseroles can be frozen, but I usually just store in the refrigerator for breakfast all during the week. If you do freeze it, expect that some liquid is released when it is reheated. This casserole has more liquid than most because of the tomatoes. For best results, reheating frozen egg casserole in microwave, thaw in refrigerator, and put a paper towel under it when reheating to absorb some of the liquid.  **************************************...  Try Chilaquiles for breakfast.  It's a great Mexican recipe:        *  6 corn tortillas - cut into wedges      * 4 large eggs      * 1 cup cheddar cheese - shredded      * 1/4 cup onion - diced      * 1 Tablespoon jalapeno - finely chopped      * 1 Tablespoon cilantro plus additional teaspoon cilantro for garnish - chopped      * 2 teaspoons vegetable oil      * 1 pinch salt      * 1 pinch pepper        * For Sauce:      * 2 cups diced tomatoes with juice      * 1/2 cup chicken stock      * 1/4 cup onion - diced      * 1/8 cup jalapeno - finely chopped      * 2 clove garlic - minced      * 1 teaspoon vegetable oil      * 1/2 teaspoon cumin      * 1/2 teaspoon chili powder      * 1 pinch salt      * 1 pinch pepper     To make the sauce:    Heat vegetable oil in a large sauce pan or deep skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes unil tender and translucent. Stir in jalapeno, garlic and spices.    Saute for for 10 more minutes. Add tomatos and chicken stock. Stirring often, bring mixture to a low rolling boil for one minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. Remove sauce from heat and allow it cool. Puree mixture in a blender until smooth. Set aside.    To make the chilaquiles:    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Place tortilla wedges flat on a baking sheet and bake for 2 minutes - just long enough to dry them out. Remove from oven and set aside. Leave oven heat at 350 degrees.    In a large OVEN-SAFE skillet over medium heat, heat vegetable oil. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes until tender and translucent. Stir in jalapeno and cilantro. Saute for an additional 3 minutes. Add sauce as prepared above and bring to a simmer. Add the tortilla wedges to sauce and stir until well coated.    Remove from heat and sprinkle evenly with cheese. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.    Towards the end of the baking time, fry or poach each egg to personal taste.    To serve, distribute the chilaquiles evenly among four plates. Top each serving with an egg. Add salt and pepper to taste and garnish with a little chopped cilantro.

Store pears away from strong-smelling foods such as apples, onions, potatoes, and cabbage. Pears usually keep for about a week.     In the freezer: Uncooked pears dont stand up well to freezing. Frozen cooked pears should last 23 months.     How to Store Unripe Pears    Unripe pears should be stored at room temperature until they ripen, which typically takes a few days to a week. Some varieties do not change color but remain green upon ripeningthese varieties will be ripe when the skin yields slightly under gentle pressure.
xrRZeROmaa	make your red sauce meatless, and substitute spinach as one layer instead of beef.  avoid butter as a thickener for your sauce, use spinach noodles for at least one layer in the lasagna.  Avoid heavy cheeses, stick to a good quality Parmesan Reggiano, and possibly a low fat cottage cheese or skim Ricotta.    Spinach can be steamed until limp, cooled, and squeezed between your hands to remove most of the liquid.  Do this over the pan your sauce is cooking in so the juice is not wasted.  Squeeze it until it is almost dry, then chop it several times with a sharp knife until it has the consistency of ground beef.  Sprinkle it on one layer of the lasagna.  use it liberally, three to four bunches.  A lasagna prepared with vegetables instead of beef, and especially spinach based is called Lasagna Florentine.    Other green vegetables, parcooked can also be added to a good Florentine Lasagna, such as finely chopped broccoli, or cauliflower.    The most authentic Italian lasagnas, use two sauces at the same time.  a red sauce prepared from cooked down vegetables, first shredded and then chopped, including carrots, onions, green peppers like bell peppers, celery, and parsley.  These are all good items for sufferers of osteoporosis.  Cook them down in a small amount of olive oil, until limp and almost dry.  Add canned tomato sauce, or stewed tomatoes, and tomato paste., along with one or two heaping tablespoons of dried oregano and a couple of level tablespoons of garlic powder.   Cook for several hours, add salt and pepper to taste.  (you can substitute a good quality store bought Spaghetti sauce of your choice, thickened with tomato paste.)    The second sauce is Bechamel Sauce, traditionally made with whole milk and butter with flour as a thickener.  Substitute Olive oil for the butter, and skim milk or half milk, and half water .  You will find a good recipe for Bechemel sauce in almost any good cook book, or on line.    Start your lasagna with a layer of thick red sauce, then noodles, then a layer of bechemel, then vegetables, and a layer of cottage cheese or  ricotta, topped with Parmesan, then red sauce, more noodles, white sauce, vegees, Parmesan, red sauce, noodles, and white sauce....... You get the picture.  end with white sauce and Parmesan on top    The white sauce that is normally served is a taboo item for those with Osteoporosis due to the butter fat, and whole milk.  The substitutions will not affect the flavor in the end product, and will greatly add to the overall flavor.  The Bechemel sauce is a binding agent that holds the lasagna together for slicing and serving.  Allow the hot Lasagna to sit for fifteen minutes after removal from the oven, before slicing.    If you pre cook this lasagna, and let it cool, it can be sliced for individual portions, and reheated in the microwave, traditional oven, or on top of the stove in a pan with a lid.  I make it a day in advance, and reheat the entire lasagna, pre sliced, at 350 for 45 minutes.  I also store slices frozen in my freezer for individual servings later.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Put plenty of calcium in it, It is good for the bones.Eat a well-balanced diet, especially with foods rich in calcium (like milk, cheese, yogurt, green leafy vegetables, and citrus fruit).

Lasagna is not a problem for them but the sauce may well be.  It of course made with milk with plenty of cheese both high in calcium but also high in cholesterol.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Terry J has the best answer of the answers given so far and this is why:    From the book, "The RAVE Diet and Lifestyle" by Mike Anderson from pages 186 to 190    Scientific literature clearly states that a "calcium deficiency disease" due to a low calcium intake from natural diets simply does not exist. - quoted from John A. McDougall, McDougall's Medicine  The American diet causes us to have blood which is too acidic. When blood becomes too acidic our bodies pull calcium from our bones and teeth to neutralize the acid and this results in bone loss or osteoporosis. To correct this problem diet changes are needed. It is necessary to cut back on all highly acidic foods.  Animal proteins are one of the most acid forming foods in existence and the biggest cause of high acid levels in most Americans. One reason dairy products are poor choices for calcium is because they contain excessive amounts of protein. Cow's milk has over 3 times more protein than human mother's milk. It was after all, designed for a calf that will weigh 300 pounds within a year of it's birth. Low fat dairy products are highest in protein, so you may lower your fat intake but you will raise your blood acid level and this will contribute to bone loss. Skim milk, for example, contains almost twice the amount of protein than whole milk.  The cause of osteoporosis is NOT a lack of calcium in the diet, regardless of the advertising from the dairy industry. Populations that consume the highest amounts of calcium [such as in the USA] have the highest rates of osteoporosis.   The problem is that the dairy industry has set US standards for calcium consumption through lobbying efforts . The calcium scare that has been going on in this country is, without question, the biggest nutritional scam ever conceived.  Bones are like muscles. The single best thing you can do to prevent (and reverse) osteoporosis is to start exercising your bones, because a lack of physical activity is the primary cause of osteoporosis.  There are lots of meat eaters with strong bones. This is because their activity levels strengthen their bones despite their bad diets. Did you ever notice that obese women and men never get osteoporosis? This is because their bodies get lots of weight bearing exercise just carrying their bodies around, regardless of their diet and calcium intake.  A recent study showed that varying levels of calcium intake, ranging from 500 to 1800 mg a day had absolutely no effect on bone strength. It was the exercise women got that was the key determinant in building strong bones. Don't worry about calcium. do worry about exercise.   Cows don't produce calcium. They're simply storage systems for the calcium they get from the plants they eat.  Plant foods will keep your blood acid levels in balance because they're alkaline not acidic. Like protein, calcium is found in all plant foods and the amounts will easily satisfy both growing children and adults.  Milk (2% fat) has 245mg of calcium per 100 calories. Romaine lettuce has 257, broccoli has 387, spinach has 450.  .........................................  Both magnesium and vitamin D are essential to absorbing calcium and Vitamin K plays a big role in putting calcium in the bones and keeping it out of the soft tissues such as kidneys [stones] and arteries [arteriosclerosis].
AA11404742	Where do you live, Missy?  My guess is that it isn't Germany.    The law said 18 was legal when I turned 18.  I lost a couple of friends because they were drinking and driving.  When the law went back to 21, the death toll dropped.  That means that the opportunity for you to drink at age 18 would mean some of the people around you would probably die so that you could have a drink now and then.      Maybe that might be you.    Kids your age don't know how to handle alcohol.  It takes some time and maturity and judgment to learn that skill.  It's easier if you're a bit older, as my generation demonstrated.    Oh, by the way - in Germany, kids can't get their driver's license until they are 18.  Would you give up being able to drive for 2 years in order to have that drink?|`|519f86c6bb67a03278f5cb12031d6128aa	I don't think it should be lowered, I do think the driving age should be raised.  I have yet to meet a responsible 18 year old and to be honest 21 doesn't seem to be much different.  Hell I know people in their 30's that should be banned from drinking and breeding but it's a screwed up world and I don't think the human race is actually capable of making good decisions so lets ban breeding first then work on drinking.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	It should be lowered to 18, provided parents can handle a society where they teach responsible consumption rather than abstinence.|`|Idv1MZIlaa	I do, as a legal adult, think that the current drinking age of 21 is rediculous. It makes no sence at all, and is totally arbirary. Who pulled 21 out of a hat? It should be 18 (maybe 19 to limit access to high schoolers) like every other legal contract. I am not one for conspiracies, but the government makes a lot more on fining underage drinkers than on alcohol revenues.    P.S. Does MADD roam around Yahoo answers? The thumbs down already??|`|X2rxQopOaa	I believe the drinking age should be 18. My reasoning is the fact that both state and federal governments acknowledge someone 18 years of age as an adult. But with this I think punishment for public toxication should be severe. I also believe drivers licenses should be first available at 18 with yearly testing for everyone.|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	It is my belief that first and foremost, we should align our legal system with the drinking age and stop being such a hypocritical society. If you are an legal "adult" at 18 years old, then why are you not mature enough to drink? I was legal when I was 18 and frankly, I got all the "drink til I puke" out of my system right away. By the time I was 19 and a half, I was drinking fairly responsibly. I am a believer that the drinking age should be 19 due to people being in College and if you are living on your own, you should be able to perform ALL the decisions in your life. Not every one EXCEPT drinking.    But the age old question is: If you can die for your country, own a business, pay taxes, serve time for a crime and own your own home, why on earth can't you have a beer?|`|2oapxZoPaa	I think it should be lowered to 18 but at the same time I think attitudes about alcohol consumption need to change. Teach kids to drink responsibly and savor the flavors rather than drink to get drunk. Parents should teach by example that having a drink or two with dinner is perfectly acceptable. Europeans tend to have a better philosophy than we do here in America.    Edit - ahh, the anti alcohol, thumbs down troll strikes again|`|446e84c620b50fc369761fcbf9a90563aa	I know why it is 21, has anyone researched this? I think its absurd that men and women can serve our country at 18 yet they cant go to a bar and have a beer. The system messed up on this one. I do think 16 is to young for legal drinking. It should be 18.|`|Q6GNAFZQaa	i think its bullshit how many 16 year old kids do you know that haven't gotten drunk or drank a little bit???? kids even younger drink. whats the point of having a law that no one follows? they should just teach drinking with moderation instead of forbidding it because its obviously not working.
