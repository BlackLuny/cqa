The printer prints horrible pictures and I am in the process of talking with Cannon about getting a replacement. In the mean time I have been considering purchasing another. I want a printer that prints decent pictures and has paper slots so I do no have to change out paper all the time. I also need an All-in-one. I have been recommended HP and EPSON printers. I do not want to spend more than $200 and would like for it to be around $150. I have narrowed my such so far to the HP Photosmart C5580, Epson Artisan 700, and the Epson Stylus Photo RX680. If anyone could help me narrow my choice down that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!

Techy Geek Question?	3 part question:      __The Specs__   OK, I've got an SLI enhanced motherboard (quad core) with 2x 8800 GTS cards SLI connected.       Oh yeah, and I'm running Vista (32, not 64).      It's time for me to buy new ram (I've got the cheapest option in there and looking to upgrade).  2x 1GB DDR2 RAM      The manufacturer recommends:   2GB (2x 1GB) DDR2 OCZ at 1066MHz (SLI-Ready Edition)      SLI ready seams like what I'd want.  OCZ appears to be the only manufacturer of SLI ready RAM.  Would SLI make much of a difference?  Does anyone really know?      Would the speed make much difference?  800Mhz is of course much cheaper (just over 50%).      PS: I'm planning on getting 4GB  (2x 2GB) if whatever I decide in the end.

20090220171948AAbuXGd	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	What does this flashing light mean?	I have an HP F4235 Deskjet Printer and I haven't had it that long.  I got the cartridges refilled and put then back into the printer. I have printed off a lot of stuff and all of a sudden I get the flashing red light on my black cartridge that says not compatible.  I've tried unplugging and plugging again following troubleshooting info but it's still there.  Any answers???  They say that the ink was probably not compatible with the HP, but if this is right, how come I've been using it for over week now with no problems?  Thanks.

20090220190437AAz4pSD	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	What is the BEST RAM/memory that I can get with the Rampage II Extreme?	Hello everyone!   I'm planning to build a new computer based on the i7 920 CPU on the Rampage II Extreme motherboard. I need 6GB-12GB of RAM, but I am wondering what speed I should get. The motherboard supports 1333 MHz nativity, but it says it can support up to 1800 MHz when overclocked. Is this referring to the RAM or the CPU being overclocked? Does this mean I should only get 1333 RAM and OC to the speed I want or will I get more power or head room going with RAM that is already clocked at the speed I want and I just push my QPI? I'm still VERY new to overclocking, never mind the new i7 platform. Any help is appreciated.      Thanks,   phate4u

20090220190038AAEI7cH	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How do I access recent Outlook files on a crashed computer but with an intact hard drive?	I recently had to go through the unfortunate event of having my motherboard go bad. Right now I am in the process of having it fixed. And hopefully they will be able to fix it, but I don’t know as of yet.       However, I have the hard drive running up with the combo enclosure.       I connected the hard drive on another computer and have tried to explore all the files to see if I could find the outlook contact folders, but I could not get anywhere.      So, I guess my question is, does any one know how or where we can retrieve the personal folder with all of the contact lists.       What I am trying to do is open up Outlook on my second computer so as to be able to retrieve the folder from my Drive F, which is now my external hard driver, but outlook opens up mandatory on the C drive and I can only see the personal folders of the outlook on the C drive only.      I would appreciate if anyone could guide me on what would be the steps to do and be able to tell me what to do. Or is there a way to import those folders onto the C drive?      Thank you for your assistance.

I've been using a program (Microsoft Expression Web 2) to design my website, so I have the html code to put in.   When I go to update my webpage online, I get a text box. So I click on the "html" option and paste my program-generated code into it. I update and save, but the page isn't showing up. All it says is "welcome to your personal webpage" or something along those lines.   If I use my program to preview my website in my browser, it shows up just as I want it.   What am I doing wrong?   Comcast tries to be too user-friendly at times, lol.   Thanks!

20090220201409AAMrVRD	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Unwanted music lyrics coming through speakers?	My computer has, for quite awhile now, played a set of lyrics that are entirely unfamiliar to me at random intervals of the day. A rap-like "Girl why you wanna hate me?" sounds through the speakers at random intervals, at entirely random times, not lasting for more than a three to four seconds.    It's not harming my computer, that I can tell, but it'll play when I have other programs running, or while I'm playing other music.    Just within the past few weeks, there is also another sound, a very alternative-music sounding "yeah" will come through, again for about three to four seconds.    I have had Task Manager open while this has happened, and I know how to use it, and I cannot see any changes in processes when the lyrics play. It plays whether or not I am connected to the internet, whether or not I have any windows open, or whether or not I'm signed into any of my three messengers (Yahoo, AIM or MSN).    This doesn't appear to be harming my computer as of right now that I know of, as I said, but it is a nuisance and I would like to nip it in the bud if it's potentially harmful.This can happen 3-8 times in an hour, or can happen once per day, it's really very random. If someone could tell me what this is/how to stop it, I would very much appreciate it.

I need a computer for a job and for a computer animation program, unfortunately, all of the "free" computers I've found so far, have "incentives" to get you to sign up and get one.

I am only wondering if there's any way for me to get a computer tryout that doesn't involve me giving out my credit card information. I'm willing to pay any shipping.

A friend took some pictures of me at our high school 10-year-reunion party we attended and she tagged me in her photos.  Although we have a few mutual friends from high school, there are other people on her Friends list who I really don't care to be friends with.  So I don't even want those people to see ANY of my pics.      I have already reset all of my privacy settings, even to the point of not allowing people to be able to search for me on FB or any other search engine.  But I don't know what to tell her.  It's not that I mind being tagged in photos, I just don't want certain people from that specific high school to see me, that's all.

20090220211718AATteaz	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Network Interface Drivers problem with new windows XP install.?	My old hard drive made clicking noises so I put in a new hard drive, installed XP professional but now I can't go on the internet. I put in my Verizon DSL install disc and it said "can not detected Network Interface Card (NIC)".       This is a brought machine, no setup disc with motherboard drivers or anything. My motherboard is MSI MS-7207G 100 which is Microstar K8NGM2 (upon searching through search engines). I downloaded the drivers and installed it on my new hard drive but some error pops up like "can't find nVidia driver, failed to install" something like that.      So my question right now if there is no easy solution is: Since my old hard drive connected to the internet and can still boot up most of the times and I can put it as a slave for now. Can I take out the drivers in some way from my old hard drive and put it into my new one. I can't copy all the old hard drive into my new one since new one is smaller size.      Thank you.

I have found an open wireless network in range of my home, I think it belongs to the local coffee shop so I am not hacking!

My wireless router attached to my pc is a Netgear WGR614 v6. I need to find some WinXP scanning software which will use the router to search and hopefully find the coffee shop network. I tried Netstumbler but that did not work because it looks for a wireless card, not router.      Thanks.

I have an ASUS P5KPL motherboard (with Intel G31) and it has 4 memory sockets described by the manual as:   A1, A2, B1, B2   A1 and B1 are yellow coloured; A2 and B2 are black.   Originally I had a 2GB stick in A1. It was running in single channel mode. Then I bought another 2GB stick - same make and model as the first. I installed it in A2 and the system wouldn't POST. Then I moved it to B1, and Windows now says it has 4GB.       How do I know if the RAM is now running in dual channel mode? I don't know if the two RAM chips have to be installed in A1 and A2 or A1 and B1 to work in dual channel. A1 and A2 are adjacent but A1 and B1 are of the same colour. The manual does not give any indication. All it says is that the motherboard supports dual channel.

I know you must hit one of the function keys before the logo comes up, but I have no idea which one, or which key should be pressed with it. As I said, I don't require a disk. I just need to know which keys to hit, and then I remember the rest from there. Thanks.

20090220214816AAVUvnZ	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Why would an ebay item be a 9 day wait? WTF!!!?	Bought used but refurbished xbox360 from eBay on the 12th of feb now its the 21st and still have not got it and the guy lives only 16hrs drive away, does any1 know why it has not come.  But dont blame the seller he seems like a good bloke in his email responses.  Could the item have been lost or worse?
20090220215342AAd62Uv	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	EBay real or Scam? Help!?	Ok so I sold my Xbox 360 on eBay for $175, Ebay sent a confirmation email and 1 min later I got an email from the buyer stating that I received the payment and should send the Item. I went to paypal and signed in, the payment was there and I accepted it, once I accepted it it said "On Hold - Ship Now" On the status section-- It was a payment for $175. I thought it was suspicions that He sent an email to me pretending to be eBay, so I sent it to their spoof email and they said it was fake. ( The email didn't give me any links, it just said to send the item.)      Theres a new Paypal policy that you have to confirm the package was sent or get positive feedback for your funds to be released.      So i looked up the address and the name on Whitebook and the name and address were in fact completely legit. The eBay users account also has a Feedback score of 210 and 100% Positive feedback.      So I don't know if the eBay user sent me that email because he buys alot and wanted to tell me to send it to him and I would be released my payment, or is there some way for him to cancel it after I send him the package.      Please Help :(                Additional Details   This is wat paypal sent me      You've received a payment, detailed below. We’ve placed a temporary hold on the funds for this transaction.      PayPal and eBay are working together to make payments for eBay items even safer. Because we want both buyers and sellers to feel confident about sending and receiving payments through PayPal, we may temporarily hold payments for items sold on eBay.      Make sure to ship the item right away, so you'll have access to the funds sooner. We’ll release the hold in 21 days unless you receive a dispute, claim, chargeback, or reversal on the transaction subject to the hold. We may release the hold earlier if either of the following occurs:      * The buyer leaves you positive feedback on eBay.   * We confirm that the item was delivered.* We can confirm delivery if you ship the item with USPS, FedEx, or UPS and either use PayPal shipping labels or upload tracking information from the transaction details page. This applies to transactions within the United States      It was in fact my real name and address in the email they sent me

20090220215227AAug4lk	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Horrible lag spikes after installing new router?	I recently installed a new router which is a Verizon Actiontec MI424WR for my FiOS high speed internet. I had to install this router because my last one died out so it wasn't by choice. Now with this router it seemed like things were going okay until a couple hours online with it. I play World of Warcraft and I noticed that I constantly get huge lag spikes and my latency goes up. It occurs around twice per minute and usually only lasts about 8 seconds but it has went on for two minutes straight before.      I noticed while on Ventrilo this occured too with the lag spikes. The only thing I can think of is it has to do with my new router but I can't figure out what would be causing this? I don't know what on earth to do to try to remedy this situation but its hard to do anything online specially play games with these kind of lag spikes.      I've tried resetting the router, tried turning it off and leaving it off for awhile as well. Nothing is working it seems. I forwarded ports for WoW/Ventrilo as well to be certain but I can't for the life of me figure this router latency problem out.       Any help would be appreciated. I don't know if I should order ANOTHER router or what =/
