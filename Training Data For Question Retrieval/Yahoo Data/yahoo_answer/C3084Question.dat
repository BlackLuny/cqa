I'd like to get some a few toys for my bf and me, and I while I've passed by a lot of adult stores around Portland, the ones I've gone in, like Spartacus, all seemed expensive (but I'm hoping this was luck of the draw, not an indication that they're all pricey).  Do you know of one or some that aren't too pricey?  Within 5 miles or so from downtown would be preferable.
