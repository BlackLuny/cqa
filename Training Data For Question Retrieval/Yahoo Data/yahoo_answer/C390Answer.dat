pcEJMHPMaa	Your compost is probably too acidic for your lawn.when encouraging yard refuse to compost and maintaining proper ph levels,add lime. It helps break it down and controls ph.water may have propagated a fungus.either way,your compost was too young to apply to your lawn.at least 6 months is properly aged.you also may have fried your lawn with the high nitrogen. Patience is key.you also should use the compost not as a top dressing, but to amend the soil.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	1) Two months is not long enough.<br>  <br>  2) When you spread it on your lawn...if it was covering up the lawn, it was smothering it.  To spread compost on a lawn to fertilize it - it would need to be fine enough that you could use a spreader.  And when you're done - you should still SEE the lawn.  The compost itself will sift down, laying against the ground, not on top of the grass.<br>  <br>  3) Rake it off - put it back in a pile.  Wait several more months<br>  <br>  4) use a spreader next time.  And remember more is not better.|`|RvddYKqjaa	When you say loan, do you mean lawn? If so, are you leaving all of your debris right on the lawn? Most people don't compost a lawn, but I'm not sure what you are doing. We dig holes and put food scraps in and cover the holes up, and that compost nourishes the soil. For the lawn we use a lawn fertilizer. I would think compost would burn up a lawn.

Jh7CmSa8aa	Somewhere close to your furnace there should be an in-line oil filter in a round canister.  On top of this, off center, there should be a small screw.  Slowly unscrew this until air starts to seep.  Don't go too far or you will regret it when oil begins running out.  After the air bleeds out oil will begin to come out the bleeder screw.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6PEZcgwPaa	You need to bleed the line at the burner assembly. There is a bleeder on the side that will look like a hollow bolt with a nipple to attach a short piece of hose that you place in a coffee can then start the burner by resetting and crack the bleeder open a little till oil and air start coming out when the oil runs without any more air close the bleeder, you may need to repeat a few times till all air is gone.

8apA3Rffaa	Some tub units need to be supported and  some are free standing, you don t specify so no one can answer that..If it is wood to wood, that means movement and movement isn t good for tile.

The joists below the tub should not be a factor.<br>  <br>  What type of squeeking is occuring? If it is just wood on wood creeking, that means the subfloor was not secure enough to the floor joists. Since the tile is already laid, it is tough to ask him to pull it up and fix the subfloor. Another fix could be to try and screw the subfloor to the joists from the ceiling below the bathroom by screwing diagonally through the joist into the subfloor. But this would cause you to pull down a portion of the ceiling and I'm not sure if a squeeky floor is worth the additional work. Your call.<br>  <br>  What type of tub is it? Every tub I have ever installed requires a wood frame to be installed so that the top lip of the tub rests on it. If you do not have this, when you put water in the tub, it will slightly sink and pull away from the walls. Unless it is a free standing tub like the old-style cast iron ones.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the tub manual that came with it. It will plainly say in the installation section if it requires the wood fram I am talking about.

I check on the book once a week to see if the smoke smell is gone. I leave some of the sheets in the book so it stays dryer fresh.
a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	They sell a kit that makes it simple. You'll have to break open the two shutoff valves and probably replace them with some that have the extensions included. Then simply retighten the new ones in and be sure to use Teflon tape on the threads so they don't leak.   The kits come with directions though and any hardware store sales person worth their hardware can show you how it's done.

I believe you can "tap" into the cold water supply with a pipe tap, then connect it via proper fittings to the spray hose.|`|ZknaSxX7aa	There may be a fitting hanging out of the bottom of the faucet fixture to hook a sprayer to. If so, it is be capped. If you have a cap there, remove it and hook the sprayer hose to it. If you don't have this fitting, you will need to get a more current faucet fixture that does have the provision for the sprayer. You need the fitting to come out of the bottom of the faucet so that you can control the temperature of the water you are spraying from the faucet handles. The extra stubs under your sink may be for a washing machine hookup, or for routing to another sink.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	One of your valves has to be hooked up to a three way faucet then the spray hooked up to that.

Take into account your travel costs and travel time which may make you late for classes.|`|bEoiVqa7aa	Stay put and deal with your "toxic" mold.    Take into consideration moving costs - decorating and/or furnishing new living quarters.    Think about extra time it will take to commute (you will have to get up earlier in the day and get home later) plus the cost of gas.    Ask prospective landlord how much are the monthly utility bills and any extras he may have forgotten to mention. For instance - who maintains the premises and cuts the grass ?? Who is responsible to fix or replace appliances, etc, etc.|`|kxfviWlgaa	First of all, not all black mold is toxic black mold - so you're likely not in any danger from the apartment where you are currently living.  If you spray a weak bleach (like 10% bleach/90%) water in the problem areas once a week or so, you shouldn't have a problem with it.    Second, although the rent is cheaper, are there other expenses you'll need to pick up, such as utilities, lawn care, furniture to fill the new rooms, etc?  Keep in mind that even if you are already paying utilities, it is A LOT more expensive to heat a house than it is an apartment.    Also, how do you propose you'd get to school if there is no parking available?  And what about traffic patterns, will you end up stuck in traffic and late for classes if you do drive?    Just things to think about before you commit to the move. :)
KHtPan4Jaa	You have firearms - what do you need to feel more safe than that?! ;)<br>  <br>  A sturdy deadbolt always does the trick. Inexpensive, and easy to install. In an appartment, the landlord would have to OK something like that, but it shouldn't be a problem.|`|SpLWveMwaa	Maybe you should talk to your landlord about fixing the problem, after-all he / she owns the property & they should be worried about their investment as well as their tenants personal belongings.|`|AfnOU04paa	I assume it is a hollow-core door as well as having a flimsy lock.  I am a landlord and am replacing all of the hollow-core entrance  doors with solid core 1-3/4" thick with good locksets and dead bolts.  Your landlord may not be willing to do that for you, but since you are a DIYfer, you could propose to him that you do it at your own expense and labor.  If he hates it when you are done, you can change it back.  The only reason I can think of that would have him say no, is that other tenants may bug him for the same thing.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	Most door latches have a small plunger on the flat that rests on the striker plate as the latch enters and locks the latch so it can't be pushed back with a card. You could beef up the striker plate area to help prevent kick-ins.Pry off the molding and glue in plywood or hard board strips to fill in any gaps there. Then double layer the striker plate and fasten them down with 3"deck screws. You may need to enlarge the the countersinks of the screw holes a bit to tighten the screws fairly flat.
FyP4QFJ1aa	I'd stick to one main theme the zebra probably would stick out a little to much in a Gold and White room so I'd suggest cheetah(gold+black spots doesn't clash as much). If the gold paint is a little shiny or gives off a good glow some silkyish blankets and pillows would be a cool addition to give off a little royalty like theme.

And how many parties you can have...  kidding.|`|AA10581224	That's tough.  I would say, agree on a flat charge for each trip you take to go there.

AA10097817	Go to a paint store and get paint chips.    With a red floor, I'd go with a light gray.|`|K0GTAH8Paa	Well if you have a dark red carpet, maybe something close to maroon, a beige colored wall would look the best.    it provides a good contrast, and its clam and relaxing.    you don't want to do anything too crazy when your working with a bright colored carpet. If it looks a little boring, you can add a mirror or pictures and it would perk it up.    But don't do anything, like blue or dark green because it would be too crazy, and you would get sick of it really fast.    something like this, but creamier.    http://www.global-b2b-network.com/direct...|`|uvnQBS6iaa	For websites, try the dulux website.  You can't upload a picture of your house, but you can test all the colours you are thinking about!  Just make it more visible.    My recommendation for wall colour would be a soft yellow for the walls if you are going for paint, or you can go for a slightly pearlecent patterned wallpaper which will reflect the light very well.|`|CF37amqVaa	Do a lighter color since your floor is dark red.  Colors like cream, white, is always nice.  I would go to your local hardware store or paint store and pick out a few chips (free) and put it against your wall to see which you like, then go back and guy it!      check out http://www.carfacial.com  adding decal to your wall would look super cute!!!  its for cars but would look great on your wall...

JLayHNZCaa	The other answers are correct, but I will add, your hot water heater temperature setting needs to be lowered to avoid the water being that hot.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	You do not have a "Pressure Balanced Valve" on your shower.|`|iyOEZg94aa	The cold water that you are using in the shower (mixed with the hot) gets diverted to the sink when you turn it on, leaving only hot going to the shower.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	It happens because your losing cold water pressure on the shower when you run cold water on the sink.|`|fPh7SrBSaa	Only thing I could suggest is to trace back the water supply pipes from the shower, all the way back to the main line.  You're going to check all the cold water supply valves that end up at the shower, and make sure they are all the way open.
JLayHNZCaa	It depends of course how the floor is built and supported.  Figure eight pounds per gallon of water plus the weight of the tub and occupants.   If the room is on a slab or a crawl space (which can be reinforced easily with short floor jacks on concrete or limestone footings) you could do it, if it is over a basement, unless you want to install floor jacks or posts under neath, probably not.|`|AA10097817	Unless the floor is concrete slab, probably not.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	NO|`|fShlKEfYaa	It's very unlikely that your floor could hold the weight unless you are on the basement floor on concrete. You would need to consult with an engineer or architect to determine if your floor could be reinforced to accommodate the hot tub. Because the hot tub is usually kept filled with water, this puts a long-term weight and stress on the floor plus you would have the weight of the hot tub occupants, the chemicals and water weight to consider as well.|`|7ES4xMloaa	if it is a wood truss you should have it reenforced with pillars or additional lumber. if it is a slab you should be fine but lay plastic between the floor and unit|`|8Q4X0XG1aa	I would put it outside, thats where ours is and its great and the stars are fantastic.  I would think that you would get a lot of humidity in your house if you had it in there.|`|74Ks1Mx9aa	I wouldn't, the weight is more like 2,880 lbs add 2 normal people and that's 3,100 lbs, I would put it outside.|`|mHsvX7UWaa	If the Hot tub is next to a wall, the weight should be spread evenly across at least six joists at their strongest positions. I wouldn't discount this out of hand, its worth asking an architect.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Liz, being your within the same color spectrum you should be able to avoid priming as long as the sheens are similar, i.e., flat over flat or satin, semi-gloss over satin or eggshell, etc. - etc.  But to get good coverage and color you should always apply at least two coats, even with a claimed one coat paint.<br>  <br>  I will give you another tip.  If you're considering painting with Behr Brand Paint Don't.  Behr, though true to color, is a very labor intensive coating to use.  Valspar Paints which are Lowes featured line are excellent and my personal and professional choice when it comes to interior/exterior latex-acrylic coatings.

Otherwise if you apply paint only over several patches, you may see a color variance.|`|dip4oxB5aa	Forget the primer, you are well past that.  Buy a good quality paint and put two coats on.  You will have to put two coats on anyway...one primer and one paint and probably even a second coat of paint to over the white primer.  Save yourself one coat....<br>  25 years experience, priming is really only needed on new walls or smoke damage or water damage.|`|KHtPan4Jaa	Although you don't need to prime for the paint to stick to the wall, the colour you chose may not come through the way you want it without priming. Having the white prime coat helps your paint coat come through the colour you want it. If it's a darker colour going over a lighter colour, you may be able to get away without priming if you apply two coats of paint. Worst case scenario, you'll have to do a third coat of paint to get what you're going for.|`|01a15b274ab4f4b0508b31a58db88c90aa	Primer is used when you have raw wood or plaster.  Primer adheres to the raw unpainted/primed material.  Once primed, the paint sticks to the primer.<br>  <br>  If your walls are already painted you do not need to prime it again.<br>  <br>  You will want to make sure the old paint is free of dirt, grime, oil, etc.  So, clean the walls first and then paint.|`|SpLWveMwaa	The swatches you see in stores are based on a white finish prior to color application, if you want the same as the swatch you picked I suggest priming the walls again. It takes less time to do it right the first time !!!|`|LCzwlN7saa	Primer is recommended depending on how deep of a purple. Not for adhering properties but for color assurance. Prime the walls a light to medium gray before painting the purple to ensure the color matches the chip. If you do not the color can appear totally differant.

An electric dryer uses electricity to cause a coil to heat up to generate heat.  Most home dryers are electric.  Gas is cheaper, usually, than electric, but if your apartment does not provide a connection for gas for a dryer, you have no choice but to buy an electric dryer.

This is perfect for a little girl or teenage bathroom, and is quite retro and fun.<br>  <br>  Walls<br>  <br>  Behr Premium Paint in Candy Coated offers a bright and fun pink wall color that is just light enough to really open up a small bathroom space. Add random large "polka dots" (four inches in diameter or larger) in black paint for a unique focal point that ties the room together.<br>  <br>  Shower Curtain<br>  <br>  I just adore this classic black and white polka dot shower curtain, available at Amazon.com. It measures 72 inches by 72 inches, which will fit the shower and tub size for most homes.<br>  <br>  Mirror<br>  <br>  As anyone with a flair for home decorating knows, Ikea is the place for quality looks for less. The Grundtal mirror is a rounder, softer shape than the square mirror found in most homes. Replace this mirror in your bathroom, and apply a smaller sized circle mirror offset four inches to the upper left to continue the "polka dot" theme of your room. <br>  <br>  Cabinets & Storage<br>  <br>  Resurface existing cabinets easily! Simply prime with Krylon All Purpose White Primer and let set the paint set for a few hours. Add four to five coats of Krylon All Purpose Paint in Watermelon for a rich and bright pink shade. If storage is a big concern, consider purchasing an inexpensive wooden shelf unit that mounts to the wall and painting the same way instructed for the cabinets.<br>  <br>  Towels<br>  <br>  Mix it up with a collection of half "fluffy to-die for" black and hot pink towels. The polka dot theme can be hard to find in a quality thread count bath sheet, so I suggest just sticking to a central color theme: black and pink. Nothing feels better after a long day than a hot shower and a fluffy towel, so don't skimp on the quality of your towels!|`|4KtPFzz5aa	Hampton Stripe Shower Curtain- Pink/ Black<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hampton-Stripe-Shower-Curtain%252d-Pink%252f/dp/B000R36A7W" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hampton-Stripe-Sho...</a><br>  Dressed to Thrill Shower Curtain<br>  <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=14816631" rel="nofollow">http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product....</a>|`|xdOgQPEkaa	<a href="http://plushliving.stores.yahoo.net/piblskshcu.html" rel="nofollow">http://plushliving.stores.yahoo.net/pibl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thepinkmonogram.com/php/first.php?ACT=1583" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepinkmonogram.com/php/first...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nextag.com/pink-curtain/search-html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextag.com/pink-curtain/searc...</a>|`|2nNfD4T1aa	ebay.com<br>  overstock.com<br>  walmart.com|`|Swtav9rWaa	This webpage enables you to build custom shower curtains with custom fabrics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.briteinc.com/Custom-Curtains/Shower-Curtains" rel="nofollow">http://www.briteinc.com/Custom-Curtains/...</a><br>  <br>  Looks like the closest color (at least from the link) to what you're looking for is Shimmer - Mauve.|`|AA12233727	<a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/180-3498858-7113557?asin=B000R36A7W&afid=yahoossplp&lnm=B000R36A7W|Hampton_Stripe_Shower_Curtain_Pink_Black&ref=tgt_adv_XSMG1060" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/180...</a>

Home Depot used to provide a CD known as Pro Book CD which updated daily on their product prices and it calculated labor costs to install/apply those materials based on the region of the country you lived or was working in (painting included).

A few days later, pick 5 or so that are sprouting the fastest. These are already good growers. Plant a bunch and do different things to each one. That way, if one dies, you won't get an F. Make sure you DONT overwater them- that thier pots have good drainage, and keep them in a window, or even outside if it's in the 50's or so. The more light they get, the quicker they will grow. Keep them close to each other, but not so close they are competing, this helps them grow for some reason. and they like to be sung to if you're really serious. You could put classical music on near them to see if that helps. <br>  <br>  Don't over do it on the fertilizer either, or they will die, or slow thier growth. look at fertilizer like steroids. <br>  <br>  You could go with composted chicken manure if you find it.

BVJBY4eQaa	Using household products and 'old wives' remedies are very short sighted when it comes to cleaning and caring for leather and can become very costly in the long run as problems they generally cause will be costly to put right. (although it does keep people like ourselves busy as we rush round fixing problems caused by using the wrong things!!!)<br>  Firstly check the type of leather you have so that you understand the results that are possible:<br>  <a href="http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/whatkind..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/whatkind...</a><br>  <br>  You need to use a good quality water based foam leather cleaner. (LTT Leather Shampoo) With light coloured leather dye transfer from clothing can be a problem although using a good quality leather protector (LTT Leather Protect) will help inhibit this. <br>  <br>  For dye transfer (which can be a real problem on pale coloured leathers) and ingrained dirt you may need a much stronger cleaner like Strong Cleaner or Maxi Cleaner (this should be used with caution)<br>  <br>  DO NOT use anything containing oils, waxes or silicones. (Most 'conditioners' contain waxes or oils) and furniture polish (pledge) contains silicones which will eventually destroy the finish on the leather. Most car cleaners also contain oils or waxes so should not be used as they leave residues on the surface of the leather which attract more dirt which eventually leads to cracking.<br>  <br>  BABY WIPES are the worst thing you can use as they will destroy the finish on your leather. This has been verified and proved to be the case. They are actually a very strong product and this is why they break down the finish. Leather is not like skin and should not be treated as such.<br>  <br>  Saddle soap should never be usd on upholstery leather or garments it is meant for saddles which are very different from todays finished leathers.<br>  <br>  A lot of leather wipes contain chemicals which will also destroy the finish or leave residues on the leather which will damage it. They are not cheap in the long run as you would need a lot to clean. A bottle of foam cleaner should do your car about 3-4 times.<br>  <br>  Fairy liquid contains more salt these days to get dishes clean and this will break the finish down on your leather. This has been verified by the manufacturers (as with the baby wipes).<br>  <br>  Magic Erasers should not be used unless you are going to renew the finish on you r leather. We have tested these recently and they sand away the top finish on the leather.<br>  <br>  Lux flakes (although they used to be a good thing to use) now contain ingredients that will damage the finish on the leather and cause it to peel off like a skin (we have seen these happen hundreds of times at customers who have been ill advised by shops)<br>  <br>  You should also follow cleaning with a good water based leather protector which will act like a 'scotchgard' and inhibit dirt and stains from being absorbed and make cleaning easier the next time. Conditioners are totally unnecessary and only a product push by manufacturers.<br>  <br>  Dry leather needs rehydrating with water and oils and waxes should not be used as the natural oils do not dry out of leather. Wiping over with a damp cloth regularly will help to do this. <br>  <br>  It is important to maintain a regular cleaning regime cleaning dirt off the surface regularly and inhibiting the absorption of body oils into the leather with a protector is the best way of doing this. The only 'moisturizer' a leather needs is from water.<br>  <br>  The alternative is a brand new product on the market called Lazy Leather. This is the latest technology in cleaning and combines an effective cleaner with a protector. It is quick and easy to use and should be used as a maintenance product once your suite has been cleaned or from new if you have just bought it.<br>  <br>  Using incorrect care products is usually the cause of deterioration in the leather as unfortunately most car care products contain waxes and oils or silicones which do not do the leather any good.<br>  <br>  Further cleaning instructions and a care leaflet are avaialable here:<br>  <a href="http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/freecare..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/freecare...</a><br>  <br>  It has been proved that washing up liquid can damage the finish on the leather which is why it|`|35qbxLCpaa	Leather, like boots for bikers and shoes and bikers vests, with color less grease ( goes fat smell) that i find in the biker or shoe shop.

OKKfyLnlaa	If the renovation is just to make you happy, I would do it, not to mention a leaking roof would be really annoying.  I would not renovate it with the idea that someone will be interested in buying it in the future, however- mobile homes only decline in value overtime.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	I'd be checking into how much it would cost to have it hauled out of there and replace it with a newer one, it may be cheaper for you to go that route!|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Yes, do renovate.  A mobile home is not well insulated, or sound proof, so adding drywall will make a difference in heating costs.  Windows are also usually single pane, changing to double pane will also help.  I would not replace the wall panels, drywall over top.  <br>  <br>  I can not guesstimate the costs, as we have always done our own renovations, a little at a time.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	The home is probably worth $3-4K if you were to resell it.<br>  <br>  If I were going to live in it for a long time, I'd do it, but knowing full well I'd never get my money back.

fgslsohCaa	My husband and I were posed with the same question but it came down to it would be cheaper for us to tear down and build new than it would be to try and renovate our old farm house (built in late 1800's) The problem with renovating is you don't know what you will find once you start and it could turn very costly very quickly.  Our house was too far beyond repair by the time we moved in to even know where to begin.  Another bonus of building new is you get to choose exactly what you want and don't and besides lot size restraints you can build anything you want. I am almost finished and about to move into my modular cape home that we started building in January (we actually started tearing down the farm house on December 26th and had our foundation put in (superior walls) on January 6th and the house was set on January 12th to give yo an idea of the timeline we worked with. Good luck with what ever decision you make!|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	I think renovation.  You can live in it and work on it in pieces, too.  But if it's a complete tear-down, it's cheaper to build.|`|0VfEo4uSaa	It depends on how much renovation is needed. It less renovation is needed then it is cheaper to build<br>  <br>  To build a house from scratch can be cheap but renovation can be more cheaper<br>  <br>  In most cases its a win win situation<br>  <br>  From my point i would say build a house from scratch Love
zSq1cS35aa	replace as soon as you can. the cover does protect you and other from poking objects around the outlet itself. when looking directly at the outlet the 2 screws on the right side that will be recessed from the walls surface (on the actual sid eof the outlet) can cause an electrical shock. these are relatively the only part of the outlet now exposed that can cause any harm. if you have any children around this missing plate may propose an opportunity for curiosity and anything metal against either of those screws will cause sparks and ultimately can cause electricution. id put tape or cardboard with tape up until you can pick up a new plate (which is $0.50).<br>  <br>  i dont blame you for not wanting to try and find or steal a plug plate at 1 am, honestly, no there is no risk that wasnt presented immediately unless an outside source tampers with it. when replacing you are 100% fine as long as you dont touch those 2 screws that would take some effort to touch if you wanted to. simply use a flat head (slotted) screw driver, remove old screw in center of plug, or on top and bottom if you have a "decora" style plug, and screw on new plate. most new plates come with screws intact, no fiddling simply line up plate and screw. dont go too far though, or you'll be where you are now. good luck!|`|2hEnSodJaa	Why would you not replace it when it is so cheap and looks so much better? You only have to worry about touching one wire (the black or hot wire) by accident, the white and bare wires are already grounded and not a danger of shock|`|vP4S6IZTaa	It should be replaced when possible. But technically, it does not cause a problem. The only thing it does is keep objects or fingers from entering where the electrical connections are.

fecUjSr1aa	Ok, so somebody already suggested the plunger, and if it sucks the clog off the sink, cover up as it will surely stink.<br>  <br>  Another way would be for you to remove the elbow joint at the bottom of the sink (There's a "U" joint down there). Through years of usage, it may not just be the puke that's clogging it but (hate to say this) slime and grime develop along these tubes too, so you may have to "explore" deeper into the sink.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you ... <br>  <br>  p.s. maybe you should call a plumber if you're not a DIY person (DIY -s do it yourself)|`|2Qb62h0zaa	just bash her up|`|3ae89bfde4e599a0fb2665b1b4cdfac0aa	Place a plunger at the sink hole with the suction part covering the hole.

Wait a few minutes and wipe the excess from the edges to blend into the wall.<br>  Try peeling part of the wallpaper away and then spray with a 50/50 solution of fabric softener and hot water. Soak it well and wait 5-10 minutes and start peeling and spraying behind the wallpaper as you peel it off. Clean the wall with TSP let dry.<br>  Get water-based Kilz-It primer and prime your walls. Let dry and you are ready to paint. I would use a paint formulated for bathrooms.|`|PuMpS7fLaa	Go to lowes or home depot they will have the things you need. You can spackle the holes if they aren't too big. You should get a primer to paint over the room first if you don't want to have a pink room.

Its worth a try, you can get a Vick's steam humidifier for about $10.<br>  I would recommend a real vaporizer though.  Supposing that a humidifier works at all, there is no way to regulate the temperature and you will most likely just end up burning your weed and waste it.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  You don't need to get a Volcano, you can get a decent vaporizer with digital temperature control for $50.

Most of the time when people are cramped in a space they are using all the areas that are waist high but if they look up and around them there is all this empty space not being used at all. <br>  <br>  Go TALL and look for nooks above for areas to put in bookcases or shelves and assign areas or zones for things. Like an Office Area, Clothing, Makeup or whatever areas you need to keep in that room- Then you can gather containers or boxes to fit the shelves to hold particular items you want to store in that area. <br>  <br>  You don't have to spend a lot of money either. You can get free boxes from grocery stores or whatever and then buy some $1 wrapping paper in the colors you like and glue or tape the wrapping paper onto the boxes so they all match. This will help it look neat and organized. If you leave just an inch in between the boxes on the shelves it will look more neat too. <br>  <br>  Sort through the stuff as you go and get rid of things you really don't use. They may be great things but if you aren't using them then they are keeping you from getting to the great things you really DO use so pass them on to someone else to use.|`|1o1mcUpraa	Because you have a small room with lots of items (depending on what they are) you want a clean look, and in order for that you need storage! You want to get storage, like (kitchen style) cabinets that will be up high in order to keep more floor space. You can pick up great cabinets at ikea that have frosted glass doors- they open up like air plane doors- bottom to top. There are some nice white ones there. And perhaps you could look into under bad storage units; etc. Is it a living room? Bedroom?

Soft: pale yellows, white and off- white, perhaps add in baby blue or a soft pink- victorian style, old traditional, with victorian floral curtains, stripes on wall of yellow and white. (thick stripes) Modern: I would go with yellow, chrome accents, black, or white, maybe add in some blue or lime green.

It sounds to me like it is similar to something called Spanish moss, which is fatal to VFTs, so I can't recommend using it.  However, I don't know this for sure, so there's only one way to really find out and that's to use it for a while and see how your plant responds.  Of course, by doing that, you risk killing your plant.<br>  <br>  I also answered this question for you on the forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=568" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/viewto...</a>|`|0MpaceJhaa	no that sisal moss have less nutrients than peat moss.

Behind the front flange there should be a small plastic springy piece attached to it. This fits into the square hole in the front of your machine. When you close the drawer you should feel a slight resistance as it clicks home. If this piece is missing or broken off te drawer could come loose by machine vibration.
