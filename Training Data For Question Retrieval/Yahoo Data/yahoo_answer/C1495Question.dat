20070126093509AAZizMi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	GLS e a biblia?	Gra?a   "Porque Deus revelou a sua gra?a para dar salva??o a todos. Essa gra?a nos ensina a abandonar a vida descrente e as paix?es mundanas, para vivermos neste mundo uma vida controlada, correta e dedicada a Deus." (Tito 2:11)      Luz   "Vivamos decentemente, como pessoas que vivem na luz do dia. Nada de orgias ou bebedeiras, nem imoralidade ou indecência, nem briga ou ciúmes. Mas peguem as armas do Senhor Jesus Cristo e n?o pensem em satisfazer os desejos pecaminosos da natureza humana." (Romanos 13:13,14)      Salva??o   "Portanto, como é que nós escaparemos se negligenciarmos t?o grande salva??o? Primeiro, o próprio Senhor Jesus anunciou esta salva??o; e depois aqueles que a ouviram nos anunciaram que ela é verdadeira." (Hebreus 2:3)      Um homem que viveu mais de 20 anos no homossexualismo, Frank Worthen, afirmou: "Os indivíduos que têm maior chance de abandonar o homossexualismo s?o aqueles que se entusiasmam com Deus... Eles vêem Deus trabalhando até mesmo em pequenos detalhes da vida deles, e seus cora??es est?o cheios de louvor."      A mudan?a vem quando olhamos para cima - para Jesus - e entramos mais profundamente na comunh?o com Ele. O grito de nosso cora??o se torna: Deus, preciso te conhecer. Eu quero te amar e te adorar. Eu quero ser um homem (ou uma mulher) que reflete a tua imagem. Purifica-me de tudo o que se interp?e entre mim e ti.      (Extraído do livro "DEIXANDO O HOMOSSEXUALISMO" Ed. Mundo Crist?o)      ..."porque até as mulheres mudaram o modo natural de suas rela??es íntimas, por outro contrário à natureza; semelhantemente os homens também, deixando o contato natural da mulher, se inflamaram mutuamente em sua sensualidade, cometendo torpeza, homens com homens, e recebendo em si mesmos a merecida puni??o do seu erro".(Romanos 1:26-27)

20090428063652AA3zfN1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can Christians live in modern day society where bigoted beliefs are no longer accepted?	Leviticus 18:22, 24 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind, it is abomination. Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things      Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.      Romans 1:26-27 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their woman did change the natural use into that which is against nature.   And like wise the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another: men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.      The only thing stopping you from fulfilling this verse "they shall surely be put to death" are modern laws that promote equality, and will not tolerate this extremist mindset. I'm sure if they lifted this law for a day, there would be a mass gay killing spree.

Romanos 1.21 "porquanto, tendo conhecido a Deus, contudo n?o o glorificaram como Deus, nem lhe deram gra?as, antes nas suas especula??es se desvaneceram, e o seu cora??o insensato se obscureceu.   22 Dizendo-se sábios, tornaram-se estultos,   23 e mudaram a glória do Deus incorruptível em semelhan?a da imagem de homem corruptível, e de aves, e de quadrúpedes, e de répteis.   24 Por isso Deus os entregou, nas concupiscências de seus cora??es, à imundícia, para serem os seus corpos desonrados entre si;   25 pois trocaram a verdade de Deus pela mentira, e adoraram e serviram à criatura antes que ao Criador, que é bendito eternamente. Amém.   26 Pelo que Deus os entregou a paix?es infames. Porque até as suas mulheres mudaram o uso natural no que é contrário à natureza;   27 semelhantemente, também os var?es, deixando o uso natural da mulher, se inflamaram em sua sensualidade uns para como os outros, var?o com var?o, cometendo torpeza e recebendo em si mesmos a devida recompensa do seu erro.   28 E assim como eles rejeitaram o conhecimento de Deus, Deus, por sua vez, os entregou a um sentimento depravado, para fazerem coisas que n?o convêm;   29 estando cheios de toda a injusti?a, malícia, cobi?a, maldade; cheios de inveja, homicídio, contenda, dolo, malignidade;   30 sendo murmuradores, detratores, aborrecedores de Deus, injuriadores, soberbos, presun?osos, inventores de males, desobedientes ao pais;   31 néscios, infiéis nos contratos, sem afei??o natural, sem misericórdia;   32 os quais, conhecendo bem o decreto de Deus, que declara dignos de morte os que tais coisas praticam, n?o somente as fazem, mas também aprovam os que as praticam."

20090203120610AAy8cID	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For people with religious beliefs, do you view medicine as a gift from God?	Many religious people maintain that the Bible is the manual to guide us through all decisions we make in our lives. At one time it was viewed as sacrilegious to even cut into the human body, it was a sin against God.    In today's society we have many breakthrough treatments and technologies to enhance and prolong our human lives.    What sections of the Bible do you feel would guide us to determine which of these advances are gifts from God and which ones are sacrilegious in regards to achieving God-like power over our own mortality.   Issues like pain management treatment during the dying process, determining when to save a life or just step back and let the person die. life support issues, and computer technology to replace body parts.       This is not a judgment on my part or a shot at anyone's belief system. I have been told that the Bible contains all we need to make these decisions. Over the course of human history, many things in the medical field that were once considered a sin against God are no longer considered a sin in most religious but not all religious circles.   How would you clarify what is a gift and what is sacriligious based on the contents of the Bible? This is not an attack, but an opportunity for individuals to reflect on what they feel they understand the scriptures to mean to themselves.

As in, the story about Mary and Joseph going to Bethlehem, no kids are mentioned. The story about the manger and the wise men, no kids are mentioned, then when Joseph fled into Nazareth, no kids are mentioned.       But when Jesus is 12, and Mary loses Jesus, and finds Him in the temple, guess what, the children are mentioned when Mary goes looking for Jesus.        So how are these kids from Joseph's previous marriage if they weren't mentioned at all?
20090203121752AAQ2YE8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come people over look the reason why Jesus told John to behold His mother?	John 19:25-27 (New King James Version)      Behold Your Mother         25" Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold your son!” 27 Then He said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home."         What jumps out almost immediatley, is that only those three women are there and John. So if only John is there, Jesus had to say that to John for cultural reasons, and He was also showing us that we should take care of the widows, as James said actually.       So why do people easily overlook this scenario of John being the only male around?

Hola a todos:   En primer lugar esa pregunta no significaba nada de mi fisico,sino , la forma en como pregunto las cosas, y por si algunos creen que tengo la autoestima muy baja,no la tengo, todo al contrario ,he sido muy valiente al hacer esta pregunta,por supuesto no me interesa lo que la gente piense de mi , me da completamente igual.   Y bien como dice Jozu Andoryu, no pretengo llevar esto a la perdicion y creo que ya me he leido de ''p'' a ''pa'' el ayuda un monton de veces y no soy la unica que hago preguntas de este tipo  pero por supuesto debo respetar las normas , y algo de razón si que llevas.   En cuanto al resto, gracias por haberme contestado estoy realmente decepcionada, pero os animo a que sigais con vuestras preguntas y que respeteis algunas preguntas, que por muy tontas que se han,por ejemplo:   ?que es un coche o el aire acondicionado(por si algunos se creen que no lo se, lo se perfectamente lo que es, pero me refiero a este tipo de preguntas que se respeten)   Gracias

20090203123611AAOJmTB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	PSYCHICS/prophets! there are FOUR men after me!!!?	There are a lot of guys in my life (5 or 6) but I don't know who to trust, who to pursue, or who to ignore!          Guy #1..We'll call him G. Well G and I used to have a thing last semester (Mid Oct 08 to Mid Dec 08) I really liked before but he did not want commitment and basically wanted friends with benefits even though he did like me too. he said it was because he's leaving in june to go back to his country but I think that's only part of it. well over the past month and a half I stopped talking to him because I figured it was time to move on.  BUT A few days ago he called me and asked to hang out (we both live in the dorms) and we did. He finally decided to take some initiative with me and I like that. Slender/fit He has a hot athletic body and a hot face. he's tall and dark brown. .          guy #2. we'll call him C. he's new to the college and dorms. I am starting to like. I know he finds me attractive and he knows i'm interested. but I don't know if he prefers me or another girl A in the dorms as well..because they are both the same country (in south america) and she is beautiful. i don't know what i should do..like pursue him, or stay back up and let him make moves at the risk of the other girl taking him...I'm not even sure if he likes me like that. hot face, good body, he's tan skinned. Has boxbraids, is shorter than me. has a nice style/fashion. V             guy #3 he'll be N. i thought he was cute, so i told a mutual friend this. So she gave him my number and he called. Now I don't know if I should pursue it. I don't know him but he seems nice. I was supposed to call him yesterday to set up plans but i never did. He's attractive. has a mature style, and has a normal/okay body      Guy #4 is J. He calls me ALL the time at every time imaginable, but something about him turns me off.  The way he talks. I heard some negative things about him but he claims he turned his life around. Something about him is a little off??? i don't know.  His face is ok/cute. his body is alright. his style is nice      but in general what do you get from these guys? What does the spirit/God tell you about each. Specifically guy #1(G) and #2(C)
20090203115937AAmPXGP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	According to this verse, is it true that only Devil Worshiper get eternally tortured?	“If anyone worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand, he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.         There are no other verses implying that nonbelievers will be tortured eternally.  They'll just experience the second death in the Lake of Fire, right?

20090225014000AAO1mab	Society & Culture;Etiquette	In need of a little advice about these guys at my job?	Guy #1-Asks about me through other people, for example,through my immediate co-worker George, and,through another manager-he asks"So how are you guys doing over there",he says that everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else for that matter.He's also called up to my job three times,blocking out his number, asking for my whereabouts and told my co-worker that he wanted to meet me, but he never showed.so i called him to chat, we talked for over two hours, and he Told me I can definetly call him anytime. And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

20090225025158AAYHPZG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, isn't this what pretty much happens?	Indoctrination is the process of inculcating ideas, attitudes, cognitive strategies or a professional methodology. It is often distinguished from education by the fact that the indoctrinated person is expected not to question or critically examine the doctrine they have learned. As such it is used pejoratively. Instruction in the basic principles of science, in particular, can not properly be called indoctrination, in the sense that the fundamental principals of science call for critical self-evaluation and skeptical scrutiny of one's own ideas.

20060920100602AAWrTzl	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	If religious people shouldn't impose their views on the rest of us, should the civil rights laws be repealed?	A lot of you seem to be very hostile to religious leaders imposing their moral views on American society:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?link=...       So, do you have a similar low opinion of Martin Luther King and the other Christian ministers who used the moral authority of their religion to help push for anti-discrimination laws?  Read the Letter from a Birmingham Jail, where segregation was called contrary to God's law, and sinful.  Do you think we should not have a national holiday to this Christian minister?      My point is that a lot of people who are claiming they don't want religion or morals to be a part of politics don't really mean that.  They just disagree with others on abortion and same sex marriage.  There are religious AND secular arguments against both, just as there were against discrimination.      Or do you oppose the fight against that too?

20070413071704AABy4Ca	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about the treatment of these Muslims?	Between Sept. 11, 2001, and August 2002, expired visas led to arrests of 738 Muslims and Arabs - none of whom was given access to lawyers or family members. These people even were denied their basic constitutional right to know what charges had been filed against them.       Furthermore, many of them were held in inhumane conditions: locked in cells 23 hours a day, taunted by officials and slammed against walls. Yet none of these "suspects" was found to be linked to any act of terrorism.       Muslims, how are you treated in your country?   Right now, I'm in Germany and everything is fine. However, I will be going back in 3 months (to the States) and I'm nervous. I already encounter hate on this site. I can't imagine it to my face.   Any advice?       http://www.islamicity.com/Articles/artic...

First, thanks for your honest answers.               1. Who here has cut themself, or has a friend/friends who cuts?      2. Is this a form of stress relief?      3. What first caused you (or your friend/s) to try cutting?      4. How many of you have told an adult?      5. If you haven't told an adult, what is your biggest hurdle in doing so?      6. Do you want to stop, and if so, what have you done to re-direct your stress relief?      7. How many of you have tried online sites like recoveryourlife.com to cope with cutting?      8. If it is not too personal, what are your ages and sexes?      9. Do you listen to emo?      10. Is it stereotyping to ask if you listen to emo, or is it true there is a link between this type of music and cutting?            Wow...I know, a lot of questions!  Guys, thanks again to anyone who will take the time to answer these questions.  I am doing a paper for a class, but I genuinely would like to learn more about this coping method.

20070128001006AAdnPkr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you agree or disagree with how society treats homosexuals?	I'm progressivly more and more revolted with peoples intrusive and condisending comments about gay, bisexual, lesbian, and transgendered people. I find that with the youth it's fine for girls to be bisexual, if not enticed, however bisexual boys are usually called fags and their masculinity is put in question.Likewise, I think that men are genuinely threatened by lesbians, mainly, because they can't fathom the concept that women do not need a penis to have sex, and, in relation,two women are not foreign to their bodys and (generally) know each others needs due to sharing the same physical features and hence possibly have better sex than a man and a woman.To me this is undeniably self-indulgent of men, to comdemn something primarily because they feel they might be rendered futile. As for gay men many people put a strain on this lifestyle by forcing a femininity on one of the said partners, is it possible, if not in theory, that there could be two ever so masculine gay men?

Speaking to others in a degrading or insulting manner is generally considered to be bad behaviour for Christians/Catholics, and similar forms of theism.

20090225001514AAwQ6IB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is the universe not allowed to "just exist" without a creator but God is?	This has been one of my major logic flaws with religion for some time now.      The argument against the big bang is that it is impossible for the universe to simply "exist" to "always be" because like a building or a car it needs to have a creator.      Well why then is God free from these constrains? Why is God allowed to simply exist without a creator.       I'm sorry but if all you have to offer is "Because he is God" or something relating to the "power" God has then just pass this on by as I'm not interested in circular logic.

20090224232500AA4Wjvb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To all Atheists:  What is it like to live then die, and that's it?	Before I get started, please note I am not trying to be offensive, nor am I asking this question to prove your belief worthless.  After all, everyone is entitled to their opinions :-)       Okay.  I am a believer, and I believe after this life I may or may not enter Heaven. However, I have no proof that Heaven actually exists. I just "think" so because I fear the end of my life.  Not that I may be sent to hell to burn, rather fear that I may never "live" again :-(       So, convincing myself that afterlife exists and do the things I feel it takes to go there frees me from fear of the end of my life.       Now, my curiosity is: How do Atheists feel about the end of their life? (i.e., you are alive "now", enjoying it pretty well, or may not be pleased with life itself, then at the end everything is over and finished with.  No more life. It's like you never exist from the beginning.)      I hope my question is clear enough to comprehend.       Many thanks for answering.   Dad

20090203140307AA7cpVR	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Help. I lost my friend?	I thought of him as a brother. When we met first time, he invited me to a party and we had so much fun. Then later I used to often hang out at his room in my dorms. Sometime later he totally stopped talking to me. I don't know what happened. He won't respond to my phone calls or emails. He even removed me from facebook contact. It will probably take some time before it heels, but I can't get off this mind, especially on philosophy class and religious where they talk about happiness, desires, detachement from pleasures. It just triggers bad memories and I can't focus. I am trying to set up an appointment with a counsellor at my school, but they're booked and not able to help me soon. I just miss him and I wonder if he'll ever speak to me again. I know where he has a class, so perhaps I would stop by after his class to talk personally to explain what happened, but probably not know, it would be too soon. I wish to tell it him personally how I feel sad, and sorry (I think I know what I screwed up, though I did not do anything malicious purposely). What should I do?

20090225014738AAmJLdI	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people feel that they have to spread lies and rumors.?	I'm a 28 year old male. I've been out of high school for almost 10 years now. I've have found that in the past couple of years that lies and rumors are spread around more now then they were when I was in high school. I like this girl, we are in the beginnings of a new relationship. She is a stripper, and one of the clubs she works at there are rumors going around that she lies and that she has a f**k buddy. I don't even believe them. From what I have learned from her over the last year of getting to know her. Is that she is honest, and she says that she doesn't have on. Even has even told me that the rumor of her sleeping with her old manager wasn't true before one of my friends told me to lose her. After one of his friends told him, and his source is girls from the club.       I guess the irony of it is she said that if she was sleeping with anyone from my area that it would be me, and that she isn't. I really didn't need the reminder. I love her, she says she loves me, and I feel that there is no way that she can really be that good of a liar. If she is then I guess I deserve to have my heart broken then, because that is one of the reasons I fell for her.

So I don't believe that Jesus is the son of God, But if our God is an all forgiving God won't God forgive me. In the instance that Jesus really is the son of God? Will God forgive me when I die and let me into heaven?    I was raised as a Catholic, but in the past few years I've leaned more towards being a Pagan. I don't know what the truth is and I'm not going to let the bible mislead me when it's been proven to be false time after time. I think that the bible is a great book with many moralistic stories on how we should live our lives.   I can't believe that Jesus is the son of God unless he comes to me and tells me himself.   There is always that fear that when I die will I go to "hell".   I would love insight from believers or non-believers, and from any religious preference.

Effects of global crisis prompt Manila to cut its growth goals      MANILA, Philippines - The Philippines’ economic managers reduced growth targets for this year, recognizing severe effects of the global slowdown that has cut export demand and may slash remittances from overseas Filipino workers.       The Philippine economy may only grow within a range of 3.7 to 4.4 percent, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ralph G. Recto said during a presentation he delivered at an economic briefing.       The government previously set this year’s growth goals at 3.7 percent to 4.7 percent.       Last year, the Philippine economy expanded by 4.6 percent, a far cry from 2007’s 7.1 percent, it’s highest in three decades.       The country's gross national product (GNP), which includes income from overseas, is expected to expand by anywhere from 4.2 percent to 4.9 percent. Last year, GNP expanded by 6.1 percent.      Agriculture, which makes up about a fifth of the economy and grew 3.2 percent last year, is expected to improve by three percent to 3.6 percent.      With falling exports, the industry sector is seen to post slower growth to 3.9 percent to 4.7 percent from last year’s five percent.      Services are also seen to take a hit as its growth forecast is between 3.8 percent and 4.5 percent from last year’s 4.9 percent.

20090203140455AAaIjpS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do I break it off....?	This is awkward but since none of you know me...      Ive been seeing a guy for nearly a year now, we're both 18, and its been really great except for the last few months. We b**ch at each other, don't see as much of each other as we used to and our sex life is basically dead in the water. We havent even kissed for weeks. I know it sounds like we should have broken up ages ago but we both still love each other, and we've got so used to being together and using the other for support. But I just dont feel happy any more being in this turmoil, and I've been tempted by other guys and I dont want to end it all badly, so how do I break it all off and still remain close friends???
20090203140500AAhS89j	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Is this romantic for Valentines Day?	Well I have not seen my girlfriend in almost a week. I miss her dearly and can barely stand being without her.  I have kind of been not the best to her in her absence.  I freak out a lot and ended up telling her that her new debate partner for speech would fall in love with her and just stupid things like that. I am also really jealous of the things she does with other people when I hear them. I am trying to make up for this by making our valentines day we have together amazing.      I would also like to point out that this is the day after our 2 month anniversary.      So she told me a while ago that she wants a 'classic date' as in I pick her up and take her on a romantic date and then drop her off. Kiss her at her doorstep and say goodbye. So I have finally planned one.       I plan on picking her up after a debate tournament at her house. I am bringing her gifts as well from the classic heart shaped box of chocolates, 2 roses (to symbolize 2 months of being together), and a special gift she wanted that I am going to buy. I will give these to her ahead of time at her house. From there I am going to take her to a romantic restaurant. We will eat and talk and hopefully have a good time.  I will pay for the food and everything then take her back to her house.      When we get back to her house I will pull up in her driveway.  I will get out and she will get out. But I will pop my trunk and in the back I will put a guitar in there in its case. I will take it out. And then sing and play her a song I wrote for her in front of her outside.  If any time remains I will maybe go inside and spend some more time with her. If not I will walk her to her door and kiss her goodnight.      What do you guys think?

Dowry deaths are a form of domestic violence practiced in India. This article talks about the typical of many accounts of dowry-related deaths that take place in India every year. In the country is very common to disturb the newly-wed bride, and in consequence woman ends her life due to dowry harassment or her husband kills her.

20090224224056AASgZHx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is accepting Jesus the only way to heaven? According Christians, it both is and isn't, so which is it?	Christians claim that the only way to get into heaven is by accepting Jesus as your saviour. Yet when unborn babies and people who live in remote places who have never heard of Jesus is mentioned, they say that these people will be judged according to what they know. This means that these people can get to heaven without accepting Jesus as their saviour and makes the Christian claim FALSE!      And it makes the concept of first having to accept Jesus in order to get into heaven invalid.  Lets say there's a tribe man who worshipped idols because he grew up being taught that worshipping idols is the correct thing to do.  He never heard of Jesus whatsoever.  Then he gets to heaven.  So that pretty much flushes the christian concept with the prerequiste of accepting Jesus for salvation into the toilet.

20090224230600AAcKkCd	Society & Culture;Languages	Could you please edit this letter?	My mother booked the surgery’s date and was preparing herself for her surgery and getting clearance by her doctor when she was diagnosed by two thyroid nodules. She was told that she needs to be biopsied before the surgery. When she got cleared by her doctor over the thyroid issue, she booked her surgery again. She was almost done with her medical and physical clearance but unfortunately she was diagnosed with flu and her CBC test showed infection in her body and therefore she was forced to cancel her surgery for the second time.    After her infection, she did a CBC test again and it showed that she was ready for her surgery but when she called to book her surgery, she was refused to be booked for another date due to the office policy regarding multiple cancellations.         Learning about your extremely high reputations and excellencies in your field, I was absolutely sure that my research to find the best surgeon, was thorough when coming to New York for her consultation more than a year ago. After meeting you, I could rest assure that I did my homework and that she will be in good hands.         Your skills and expertise and your extreme patience in this matter convince me that you are the only surgeon that I trust. She had been through a lot of difficulties and abuse in her life that caused her to look older that her age. This surgery would make her extremely happy and would give her a new life. She means the world to me and I only want the BEST for her.         I have a lot of respect for your office policies, however; I do not wish anybody else to operate on her but you. I feel most comfortable with you and have the utmost trust and respect for your capabilities. I was wondering if you could waive this policy in my mother’s case this one time only. It would mean a lot to both my mother and I.         I apologize for any inconvenience that my mother’s situation may have caused.

When I got older I wondered if there was such a religion with the beliefs I had, I found that what I was believing was in fact Judaism. I never knew anyone that was Jewish or that practiced Judaism, so I started to learn on my own all I could and decided that I wanted to convert to Orthodox Judaism.

Matthew 7:24-27........24"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash." NIV      Commentary   Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master, only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that we believe in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life, that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification. Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest we deceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a lie in our right hand.       Is the commentary correct ?   Do you think that these verses show once saved always saved wrong ?   Is the scripture a call for Christians to be actively living by Christ's words ?   Are these words of Jesus relevant today ?   Can you add any relevant scriptures or comments ?

20090225022054AAGZFCs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking: Was this an act of god?	One day while walking alone in the woods, a man came across something that gave him reason for pause...  a brittle, mishapen branch had fallen from an old tree and landed by the bank of a small but quickly moving stream. Balanced precariously on a stone jutting out from the underbrush, the branch teetered back and forth, one end dipping in the edge of the water, then falling back, tapping lightly against the stone. For nearly a half an hour the man watched this, transfixed by the picture of beauty before him... the gracefull run of the stream, the delicate rhythm of the branch's tapping... he watched, and began to lose himself in the simplicity of it all...  then, as he sat crouched by the side of the stream, sun breaking through the tips of the trees, a cool wind gently scraping across his cheek, he had a revelation... "great," he sighed... "now I have to pee."

In the brilliant Nova episode that just aired, the main doctor for the plaintiffs (who sued a school board for trying to shove a creationist book on the 9th grade science teachers and students) explained that "theory" can only be used to describe a well-tested description of the world.      At this point, I just really want to know why Creationists, evangelicals, and many other Christians in America go about actively ignoring facts and information.  And then, as if we all can't see them ignoring the truth, they say that what is real is not real... actively ignoring reality!       If you self identify as a Creationist, or supporter of Intelligent Design, how do you justify denying the truth?  Isn't that Satan's job?

20090225021813AA32csW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Have you ever had a strong  love with someone, but the  relationship still fell apart?	My story is that I had a boyfriend who I could tell really loved me, but his past experiences "forced" him to do certain things that hurt me really bad. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he really loved and cared for me, but eventually we broke up, he didn't cheat on me...other things happened though that really broke my heart, and for some reason Im still not over him, much to the chagrin of my friends
20090225022717AAe1g85	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Which one would go to heaven?	man #1.      does nothing wrong his entire life. yet he never got "saved". dies an old man who has always been faithful to his family and done many great deeds.      man#2.      killed 2 people. but got saved while spending life in prison....            they say that salvation "being saved" will put u on a straight path to heaven...given the two circumstances above...is that really fair?      man #1 did nothing wrong but because he didnt "get saved" he goes to hell while man #2 commiitted two counts of murder but because he accepted jesus as the "lord and savior" he gets into heaven???

20090225022719AAUhd5r	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What is it about these people and crime? opinions please.?	Now before you read on, i am not a racist in any way - i have many coloured friends and always have. I had this discussion with them last night and thought it would be interesting to get other people's opinions.      I work as a crime prevention officer in the UK, and i deal with crimes everyday, such as - robberies, muggings, rapes, fights etc.      One thing i have noticed, is that about 75 percent of these crimes are committed by black youths.      I ask myself and others, why is this? When there is a robbery, or a mugging etc, it's always a black suspect. and this is 75 percent of the time.      I'm not saying other minorities don't do things wrong - they do - but why is it mostly the black race who commit the crime? and they always seem to have a chip on their shoulder or a bad, aggressive attitiude about life.      I just don't understand it - can anyone speak from experience?
