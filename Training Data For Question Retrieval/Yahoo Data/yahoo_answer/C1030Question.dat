20090307150200AAp1mBu	Sports;Running	Planning to try out for cross-country in high school but I don't know how to increase my distance?	Hi, I'm going to be a freshman in high school this fall and I want to try out for cross-country. The problem with this though, is that I can barely run a mile in under 10 minutes in my eighth grade P.E. class right now. But that's only because I don't try in P.E.. Not because I'm lazy, but because my friends want me to run with them and they run extremely slow.       Anyways, I've heard that the shortest cross country length is three miles. I'll be more than willing to run over the summer. The only problem is that I don't know how to increase to four miles, which is my goal by the end of the summer.      How should I go about doing this? Should I start by running a mile every day for two weeks and gradually increase by .2 of a mile? And also, what is the standard length for high school country at practices and competitions? Thanks so much everyone.      P.S. Don't tell me it's impossible or beyond my limitations because I know it's not.

I was watching this horror movie about 2 weeks ago on t.v. the setting and picture look like its recent. Anyways I caught the tale end of it and forgot what the title was. I just remember some professor i think, and he won't let the girl out of the place. then im not sure if its jason or who but this guy in a mask comes out and he looks like a teen and they show his story real quick, i guess he had a bad childhood. then he puts the mask back on apparently and kills the professor. the girl goes and ends up killing him presumably. the cops come and it shows that she though she killed the guy but it ended up being some girl. she then repeatedly says "he's still here!" and i guess they arrest her.then the movie ends.   its not scary movie or scream if that helps. anyways thanks.   p.s, i know its not a sports question, but da sports section is nice and thought yall would answer it for me   thanks.

20090307153354AACzQBm	Sports;Wrestling	Did the first wrestling experience influence the type of wrestling you like?	Right i'm not sure how to explain this so i will get my view first.       The first wrestling company i watched was WCW in the late 90's and at the time i didn't have the internet at the time so the name Hulk Hogan didn't mean a thing to me. All i knew about Hogan was he was a lumbering excuse for a wrestler that could barely move but lower on the card was the WCW crusierweight who were amazing to watch, Fast paced amazing wrestling. So now I would much rather see the WWE's world title on Jamie Noble, who can wrestle, over Batista a big lumbering overrated wrestler and i think i can link that with my first wrestling experience.      If you think about it are you the same? can share your story if you like if not just an example and yes or no is good.

He used to go to the table stand and stand on it sometimes and throw the chalk in the air after he put it on his hands and the T-Wolves fans used to cheer and Garnett would yell to get the crowd pumped up. A guy on here said something about the Lebron James chalk scene he performs before games. I was like..."Hey, that was Garnett that used to do that way before Lebron even came into the league." I used to see him do it all the time and Lebron wasn't even in the NBA yet. LOL Truth.

20090307120424AAv8Jzh	Sports;Other - Sports	Please help me decide what to do about softball!?	So last year, I tried out for my school's softball team. I was one of the few people who didn't make it, even though my best friend, who is way worse than me, did. This year, when I tried out again, the coach decided to make two teams instead of cutting people. One team plays in real games, and one team just plays the other team to make them better. Both me and my best friend made it on the bad team. The problem is, I hate playing on this team. It makes me feel like I failed myself and my parents. I'm reminded of this every time I have to play or think about the softball team, and I feel like crying. I really want to quit. My mom doesn't want me to. My dad says I should. If I quit, I also may ruin the relationship I have with my coach, who is also my science teacher- she seems to like me right now. Plus, I won't get better at softball. If I keep playing, I'll have to keep living like I am now (crying all the time, etc). What should I do?

20090307103701AADOjSD	Sports;Hockey	Alexi Laiho's picking technique?	Is it strictly alternate, or does he use economy picking?      I asking mostly in reference to his solo's and 3 note-per-string runs. of course you can pick their rythm riffs and such any way you feel comfortable. (and then there is sweeping =P)      But Ive always found it to be debatable if strict alternate picking or economy picking was more successful for speed. I know everyone has their own opinion. I have always used both, it just depends on what I'm playing,       but over the past four months or so I've been trying to narrow down my technique to focus more strongly on one      I'm curious what technique Laiho prefers. I've seen him live and watched alot of videos, but its hard to tell.      I'm also interested in the same question in regards to Chris Storey, from All Shall Perish.      I've been playing for a few years, and have always found it most helpful to watch and learn from professionals who have a style similar to my own, and what I hope to aspire to.      Perhaps one of you guys know more about these guitarists style?

20090307122315AAIQBLo	Sports;Wrestling	Will Mr. Kennedy Ever Become A Main Eventer?	I think Kennedy rose so far so fast that eventually he couldn't keep up with his own success. Lack of a well defined character, injuries, and not particularly impressive backstage skills have plagued the self announcing superstar from the start.      Just when he seems to get some momentum BAM! Something hits him or WWE gets cold feet on his push. I think Kennedy needs to get down to the basics and go somewhere where he can re-establish himself; ECW.      Being a big fish in a small pond would be just what Mr. Kennedy needs. He's got the ring skills, he's most definitely got the mic skills, but Mr. Kennedy needs to be somewhere where he can stand out, gather a hardcore following, and be under the radar enough that WWE feels comfortable adding more dimensions to his character and pushing him to the moon.      Plus, a smaller stage means that Kennedy might not feel the anxiety and stress that could be contributing to his frequent injuries.      Put him on ECW for a few months and let him work from the bottom. He'll be ready for the top one day. And that day might be sooner than we think.      Do you agree with my thoughts and would ECW be the right place for Mr. Kennedy? Most Detailed gets Best Answer. Thanks!      Star If You Like.

20090307124644AAgaH29	Sports;Wrestling	Is WWE getting boring to watch?	do you wish there wasn't anything fake about wrestling?   are you sick and tired of celebrities getting in the ring and hanging around with wrestlers?   Is MMA true wrestling?   Why is WWE PG?   Do you think it was a bad idea for Gail Kim and Christian to leave TNA for WWE? they were stars in TNA. TNA has better competition for Gail Kim and Christian was a main eventer in TNA but now he is on crappy ECW.    Are the wwe divas great wrestlers or eye candy?   every sign in the crowd is  a lovey-dovey sign that says "will you marry me or your hot"   Jerry the king Lawler and Tazz are obsessed with their beauty and they don't care about the one thing that matters and that is wrestling.   The Divas keep wearing tops and really short tights every time they pretend to wrestle. It takes years to be a wrestler and not a few months like most of the divas and fcw divas. Miz and Morrison is boring to watch just like the other tag teams. And one more thing Matt Striker is making ECW boring.

20090307123921AAJIxQ6	Sports;Wrestling	What happen on RAW  and SMACKDOWN just makes you think stop this dumb draft and join the shows up?	i mean it's sweet how everybody is on  what ever show more matches and better feuds and everything besides just  one show things get better that way and dont give the bull about oh people wont be used people ar ealready not being used at all most of the damn rosters people got fired because their not used and they dont have anything for they all shows have a main amount of people they use and you see every week so why not join them up but  vince wont do it just though i put that in there,but on the other hand triple h is gonna kill legacy you saw how he was whoopin on them he threw ted off of him with one arm when they went through the ropes  it was like  y2j and kurt angle jumping triple h and him whooping their butts like always and then ortan  he's gonna get his people forget how they made a deal if they dont touch each other then none will be in trouble or have their match at mania and orton didn't go by it he touched triple h which no papers ere signed anyway like they did with triple h and stone cold in the 2 out of 3 falls the game or austin could not touch each other.but  what do you guys think about that like whats gonna happen next when raw comes on  and i  see so much melina and   natalya from smackdown  goin at it on raw but more of triple h and legacy is what i want to know about and how undertaker and hbk will go off it'll be like it was when they fought in 1996,1997 i hope,but again what do you think will happen up to mania with triple h and  orton because as you hear don smackdown orton said he remembers what triple h did to him in 2004  it's like triple h is getting payback in a way from his days in evolution beatin and jumpin the hell out of people now it's his turn even though he's my favorite.but a heel turn for him is coming late this year

I barely recall the exercises my high school cross country coach had the team do, just to alternate days between long runs and short runs.

I still want to enjoy my runs since it is absolutely gorgeous where I am studying abroad and I really enjoy looking around as I jog around.      If it helps, there are some small and steep hills here in the city where I run.  There are also dirt, paved, and cobblestone paths.  Thanks so much, fellow runners! :)

20090307143632AAqYEv7	Sports;Basketball	What do you all think of Brandon Jennings?	He couldn't go straight to the NBA last year because of the new rules, so he signed a 1 year deal in Italy instead of going to college and is projected to be a top 10 pick this year.  I just don't see it.      He's playing in Italy, which no one would compare to having near the talent of the NBA, and his stats are awful.  6.5 points per game, 2 assists (for a PG) 60% FT (rivaling Shaq, and hes a PG) and like 15% from 3.  I'd expect those numbers to actually go down in the NBA since you have better competition, so how is he still considered a top 10 pick?
