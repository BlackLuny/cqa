20090205163902AA712jr	Pets;Dogs	Greenies? Dog treats?	About a month ago my friend was over and saw a bag of Greenie's. She freaked out and told me not to give them to my dog. She said that they were making dogs sick and she went online to a news website so she could show me the article. My dog is 6 years old and I've been giving them to her for as long as I've had her. She hasn't had one though, ever since my friend has been over. I have a bag of them sitting on the bench in my room and she is always staring at them and trying to get them out. She even cries about it sometimes. I feel bad because I know she really likes them. She's never had any problems with digesting them. She is 20 pounds and I usually give her "Regular" size ones. Would it be safe to give them to her again? Or should I replace this treat with something else? Thanks.

20090205163959AA1A7qT	Pets;Dogs	What dog has the fierce look, but is actually cuddly and sweet?	my rottweiler would be a good example. she has the mean/bad rep and 'the look' (as the rottweiler breed has), but is really the biggest baby ever.   my boyfriend is moving soon, and he wants a dog that has the "big and bad" rep, but is really a gentle and sweet dog.   nothing small, and mixed breeds would do just fine. he's definitely going to adopt from a shelter, but he wants a basic idea of what he's looking for. he doesn't want a german shepard though, he just doesn't like them. He'd get a rottweiler, but since i'll be moving in with him and i have a rottweiler, we want something else that still has those traits.   any suggestions?

20090205164303AAzz1SE	Pets;Rodents	I have bought a modular home for my 3 winter white hamsters who are 7 weeks old?	Will they grow big enough to be able to climb up the tubes that go upwards because at the moment they seem tiny and can't get to any other section of their home apart from using the tubes that are on the first level. If so can people give me an estimate of how long it will be before they can climb? They are about 2" at the moment and quite slim. I have only had them 2 days and they don't seem to bothered about the tubes, apart from 1 of them who tried to climb up but found she couldn't since she was too small!

I have a 3 year old Austrailian Cattle dog who is fearful of a lot of things...one that really puzzles me is that she runs and hides under the bed when the phone rings.  Also she is afraid of loud talking. Whenever, my husband and I raise our voices...say because the other one is in the other room, she runs and hides under the bed.      Am I inadvertily reenforcing this behavior by trying to conjole her to come out from underneath the bed after this happens?       Thanks
20090205170120AA7XIh9	Pets;Dogs	Dog medical question (epilepsy?)?	Okay here's the story, and it's long.. brace yourself.       About two months ago I woke up and my dog was shaking, it looked like he was just dreaming but it worried me so I woke him up. His whole body stopped shaking EXCEPT his head. He was completely conscious and he could walk. His head was shaking from side to side and up and down. It was definitely involuntary. This was at five in the morning so we called the E-vet and they told us as long as he was conscious and breathing to wait until 8:30 when the regular vet opened. His head would stop shaking from time to time, but for the most part from 5:00 am until 8:00 am he was "seizing". We got him to the vet right at 8:30 and they took us in. At this point and time he was not "seizing". The only thing the vet found was that his heart rate was slightly low for his age, besides that he was perfectly healthy. They took blood work to find out if he had anything wrong internally; the blood work came back perfect. The vets had no idea what was wrong with him. They told us it was an isolated event caused by something unknown. The doctor told us that we had the option to put him on Phenobarbital, but he recommended that we didn't. To this day he has not had another seizure (what ever you want to call it). A couple days ago was his vet appointment to get his adult vaccines. We had a different doctor than the one we saw two months ago. She told us that it is possible that he has epilepsy, but there is no way to diagnose it unless he has another episode. Her hypothesis is that he will (at some point and time) have another seizure, but it is quite possible that it was just a quirky one time thing. Again he left with a clean bill of health. We have contacted his breeder and she has seen no signs of epilepsy in his bloodlines. (Which was predictable because she would have never bred a dog with a health problem). Our breeder is now very concerned (as we are). The vet told us that he is going to have a long healthy life regardless of him having or not having epilepsy. So after all of that, my question is.. Has anyone had (or know of) a similar experience? What ended up happening with your dog? Do you know of any other causes other than canine epilepsy? Again, this happened one time during his whole life. He is perfectly healthy otherwise.      Thank you for taking the time to read this.

20090205165722AAu8aFg	Pets;Fish	Is everything going to be alright with my fish tank?	I have a 125 gallon tank that has been running now for about a month .. I have an Eheim 2217 canister filter and also an Emperor 3000 hanging filter .. The occupants of the tank include three 3" oscars, three 3" blood parrots, and two 3" plecos .. All fish seem to be fine except for one oscar who developed a cloudy eye, now he is in a 10 gallon "hospital tank" being treated with Melafix .. I did an ammonia test today on the 125 gallon and it came back with high levels .. I did a 25% water change by using the gravel syphon and plan to do so for the next couple of days until the ammonia level goes down .. Is this the right way to attack this?  Also is this happening because my filter has not yet cycled?       PS .. I do not have the nitrate/nitrite readings

There was a couple things that were pretty big distractions, such as it being too close to feeding time and the noise from my neighbors cutting firewood. So hopefully i'll have better luck this weekend, any tips? I'd also would like to hear any opinions on join up.     She's 9 and she does pretty good under saddle and her ground manners are passable.

20060619110109AADgxGm	Pets;Dogs	How can I teach our new dog to play?	We have a spoiled, happy-go-lucky 4 year old neutered male dachshund that we decided to find a brother or sister for so he wouldn't be lonely while we were at work.  We were thrilled to find another 4 year old neutered male dachshund in a rescue shelter a few hours away.  Unfortunately, the new dog doesn't want or doesn't know how to play!  I don't know much about his history, but he did live with other animals and children.  He is a real love bug, who cuddles and wants to be held.  He is a little shy, but not extremely so.  But when we throw a ball, he just looks confused and when our dog tries to play with him, he gives a little growl and looks defensive.      We will definitely keep him, as he is a sweet little guy, but I'm disappointed that our first dog doesn't have a playmate like we'd hoped.  Can a dog be taught to play?  Is he just nervous from all the changes in his life right now?  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

He seems lethargic, labored breathing, minimal bowel movements.  Our vet will not be in his office until tomorrow.  He is still eating, though not as much as usual.  Any ideas?  Thanks!!

20090203053326AAkusJy	Pets;Cats	Should I adopt a cat under these conditions?	Between 59 weeks of unemployment (including 33 weeks of emergency benefits) and other money saved up, I will be in my apartment until at least May 2010.    I will have more than enough money to take care of a cat each month.    I also have money in the bank that would cover big vet costs.    This is a total of 15 months.     I will be home a lot until I get a job, and I want to devote a lot of attention to a cat. If I have to, I will work in fast food or retail and move to a cheaper apartment to support him/her.    Is this situation familiar with anybody? Do you think it's OK to adopt a cat?

20090203054730AAM23ts	Pets;Dogs	How do you potty train an American Dingo dog not to pee in his kennel?	We have a 6-yr-old American Dingo who absolutely insists on using the bathroom in his kennel.  We can't even get him to go outdoors, and my boyfriend says he gets like this with snow.  I CANNOT have this dog peeing in the house like this.  I don't want to get rid of him as he has become a favorite with my 5-yr-old son, but I am so tired of smelling dog pee all over my house.  The dog is stubborn to a fault, and makes no effort for everything we have tried so far.  My boyfriend attempts to take him out every few hours or so, but most of the time he won't leave the porch.  I'm a little more forceful with Buddy, but at 7 months pregnant cannot do more than yell at him right now.   Please help... I'm getting desperate...

20090203055103AAahdPW	Pets;Cats	Behavioral issue with 9 month cat - need expert advice?	I have a 9 month old male cat. Recently he has been very persistent/annoying when it comes to his morning feeding. We have a two-bedroom townhouse and it used to be that he would sleep on the other bed until I got up at 6am, at which point I would feed him. But now he seems to be waking us up at different hours of the morning (anywhere from 4-5:30 am) by running/hitting our long vertical blinds in the bedroom which makes A LOT of noise, waking us up. I think I initially enforced this behavior by getting up and feeding him, thinking he would stop once I did and then I could go back to sleep. Well he stops for like an hour and then goes crashing through the blinds again. I have tried shutting him out of the bedroom when I go to bed but then in the middle of the night he just insists on throwing his body into the door continuously, which wakes/keeps me awake until I get up and feed him. Why is he doing this? How do I stop it?      I actually think it has nothing to do with being fed since he has lots of dry cat food and half the time doesn't even eat what I put down when I do get up. Why won't he let me sleep? HELP!

On m'avait dit que l'opÃ©ration calmait les males. Le mien n'est pas vraiment calmÃ©. Il a arrÃ©tÃ© les miaulements rauques et de le marquage. Mais la nuit, c'est l'enfer. Il nous rÃ©veille toutes les nuits entre 2h et 4h. Il n'est pas enfermÃ©. Il peut aller et venir comme il veut et en plus il y a un balcon. Mais ca ne lui suffit pas. Il faut le menacer d'une bonne douche pour qu'il arrete. On m'a parlÃ© de gouttes homÃ©opathiques pour les chats qui les rendent plus calmes. Qu'est ce que vous en pensez ? Et comment s'appelent ces gouttes ? Merci de votre aide
