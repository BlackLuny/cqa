D0i0oyRhaa	On a domestic level:    The USA has the highest crime rate in the world and the newscasts are full of scare stories.      Now, on an international level:    The USA is a very paranoid and scared country.    This warmongering and paranoia has been going on for years.  There is always some bogeyman "out there."      The Communists, the Russians, the Vietnamese etc. etc.  "They are out to get us."    And the saddest thing is that most Americans believe the propaganda that the American Mainstream Media pumps out.  The vast majority of Americans are brought up in a way that cuts them off from the rest of the world.  They know nothing about what goes on outside the US borders.  They are brought up to know very little about geography.      I would say that the vast majority of Americans cannot locate Iran on an atlas of the world.    It's sad, but true.  Americans are like the Germans of the 1930s and the Russians from the 1950s.  Clueless cattle.|`|VLDlOpbOaa	i don't know,  but i am definitely not afraid of either country, Iran can't touch us, and we are some what friendly ( as in a mutual understanding , lol) with Russia    a war with Russia would be the death of all of us in the world, and both know this, so that is what i mean about having a "mutual understanding",  i really wish the USA and Russia would become better allies    and women should be nervous about walking the street at night, it is unfortunate that we have so many **** heads in our country, but that is crime, not a threat|`|ClfEVNCNaa	lol, you are so ignorant.  Worried about Iran? Hhahahaha!!!!  What can Iran do????   NOTHING.  Their missiles have a max range of 2,550 kilometers.  It won't get halfway to us!  your question is baseless.  Ang by the way, 99% of America feels safe.  Your ayatollah should be worried.

Of course we worry about our immediate environment and safety in it for us and our loved ones.  But, we also worry about Iran which is being run by a bunch of insane muslims with the craziest at the helm.  And, they're going to get nuclear weapons sooner or later.  They might even have them now.    What we don't worry about is our government telling us what kind of haircut we can have or arresting us in the middle of the night on no particular charges but just at the whim of some idiot called Ahmadinjab, the fool.|`|RSDSrtieaa	Bcz Americans are Poltroon , Coward and Timid nation  they know that they kill innocent people in iraq and afghanistan so they will face problems from those peoples  so that hey don't feel safe letting their kids play out for 2 sec's|`|RnhKv6Bgaa	Dont think so, I just walked down the streets and they were a lot of kids at the mall  and on the streets  and back yards playing around.|`|AA10560132	I really don't know, but I do know I don't want war, but if they won't quit building Nukes then..........

AA10560132	No because he thought he could win against these sneaky terrorists. But you can't win when Liberals are involved. C.A.I.R.N. have been planning the take over of america for many, many, years. I heard about their plans when I was very young, but the world and no one listens to them. Now they are very careful and sneaky because they know they will be ignored until they win. Michael won't be listened to, like so many others try to warn us, but to no avail. I guess we will just get it because of ignorance. They have always said they will take us from within...(Obama)?

ZbcHAoz9aa	Obama is popular with the people but is he with the one that counts at the end of the day?    When you overturn the ban that sends money to Africa for abortions it becomes more then political. It is a moral issue and can be a crime in some states here.    So, face God he will with the blood of those little babies on his hands.  They are not dogs, or cats or an animal. They are little babies with hands, feet, eyes and a beating heart at the moment of conception.    He claims to be a christian but I beg to differ. He is anti christian which is anti Christ.    By their fruits ye shall know them..the crowd is not always right . Look at the crowd when they killed Jesus an innocent man.    You decide.|`|LJLU5FZQaa	Sigh.  Unfortunately there are people like my sister-in-law who think so. It is a kind of Christo-fascism ( hey, if there is such a thing as an Islamofascist which I doubt, then there are Judeofascists like settlers who burn down their neighbors olive trees to force them from the land that they feel was divinely given to them and there are Christofascists who feel that if you accept the idea of gay marriage and the right of a woman to control her own body then you are in league with a mythological being they call the devil.)  Luckily, they are few --maybe about 10% of the population with another 15% going along with them at most because they are too afraid to think for themselves.  Yeah, 25% of the population of a supposedly educated, wealthy country.|`|vOXuF2hXaa	not sure i think that you have to make your own mind up|`|RhkKGsipaa	Some people will not accept an African American as president and will constantly keep trying to belittle the man.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	You see, the Republicans are punch drunk and bitter as a result of the last election.

LNNJgF2Xaa	This is tricky.  Sometimes, "restricted free press" is a matter of  perception rather than reality.  If a government official asks a reporter not to print a story and doesn't use coercion, is it restricting free press?   You also have an entire industry built around trying to manipulate the press, but not necessarily restricting it.  And sometimes, there's the issue of withholding access to an official because somebody is piqued with a reporter.  These are all gray areas.    Still, you can find some clear-cut cases.  For example, in World War II, coverage from the front line passed through government censors before reporters could dispatch articles through the wires to their home papers.  Walter Cronkite recounts as much in his memoir, _A Reporter's Life_.  Additionally, as noted in the source below, government played favorites in early colonial America by awarding printing contracts to favored printers and media outlets.  Go against those in power, and you lost your government printing contract.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	I can give you anecdotal evidence.    I'm an American living in England, I get to read news here that my family back in the US never get to see...news about what's happening in the world and the US.    Even if it does surface there, it's always a few days later.    Has to be a reason for it other than just being a bit slow.

But certain words set of the ***** function. Its whether ppl report it after that counts.|`|kUlZCbhNaa	Your Question can go through a manual reviewing process before others are allowed to answer.  YA has a flagging system that activates when certain words are typed into a question.    YA is a very liberal forum.  If you are going to ask questions or answers that upset people you better use a dummy account or the liberal users of YA who do not have a sense of humor will ensure your account/question/answer is deleted.    There is no point fighting this.  It is just the way YA is!|`|vvpiYDqSaa	I barely believe Yahoo has Moderators, let alone the intellect or desire to censor issues. They let anything go... love the flamers and the freaks and do very little to keep anything they produce to a professional standard.
5zQbG8TDaa	I waited 2 1/2 hours in line. So there were lines. I'm in Orlando. Most were older and Spanish in my area.|`|j6LnoHW9aa	It depends on your area, and the time you go.

I went at 7am and was the only young person, but the majority of people there were black. Just depends on where you are.

The problem is that anyone who disagrees with you, can report it. That doesn't mean that anything will actually happen, I think 2 people have to report your comment for Yahoo to kick you out. So, I think possibly your comment will be back tomorrow. Sorry that happened to you.

ja12Tgbcaa	Great question and I was thinking the exact same thing.    With Fox News I never cease to be amazed how terrible and unprofessional their reporting is. They call themselves "Fair and Balanced" and use the slogan "We Report. You Decide." but their reporters so often inject their own personal opinions and feelings that are mid to far right and Republican-minded into what they are reporting. It's very hypocritical.    And when they sit around the couch with others they often throw around their opinions so much that I often forget I am watching what is supposed to be the news and feel more like I am watching a gossip/talk show.    If you watch their channel lately it seems that ten minutes won't pass that they don't directly or indirectly say something bad about Obama. I mean of course they should report anything bad about anyone but it is far too obvious already that they have some sort of agenda going on.    Unfortunately, their overly anti-Obama stance and side comments will surely get worse as election day gets closer. =(|`|54eaa858549c153856068ca3aa60f995aa	Fox is just a business which caters to its viewers who are Conservative.|`|AA10568066	Fox News is a business serving product aimed towards their consumers.  Their consumers are generally "conservative" republicans.  They know by targeting the news toward this group they will have a loyal base of viewers for selling ads.  Their viewership watch Fox News because they feel like it addresses their concerns (slant).  Does that mean Fox News is biased? Definitely it is.  Does that mean it's no longer "news" but is an entertainment product packaged as "news"? Yes.    With that being said, Fox is "preaching to the choir." 95% of their viewership is going to vote Republican no matter whom it is.    Do I think that this accounts to a campaign contribution? No, it's an endorsement.  However, this is a good conversation starter though.   .|`|ZulFhMdIaa	becoming?  it always has been|`|5882ecb902b9aba02af56125256535d9aa	Fox news covers the news 24hrs and they spend those hours campaigning for McCain.  --------------------------------------...    I think you are stretching the facts to suit your needs. Fox is no more guilty than MSNBC or CNN or CBS of catering to their audiences.  Plus, they can give airtime to whatever they want, just like the others can  In my mind it sure would be boring to only have Liberal outlets droning their gloom and doom constantly.|`|dVI7HmXHaa	it's always been...    fox always backs republican...    i am not democratic or republican, i am indenpendent....    but everytime i watch fox news, they always attack obama, and having shows like obma's history with terrorists......

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	I am so tired of reading these kinds of arguments.  Where people were born and raised has very little influence over what "race" they are, particularly when it comes to the US, which is a highly heterogenous country.  This whole issue of trying to determine the percentage of one race or the other in someone's makeup is meaningless anyway, from a genetic standpoint, and recalls those days when it was considered very important to determine those ratios.  In the Old South, for instance, because of differing state laws as to what determined whether or not a person was black, it was possible to be considered "white" in one state and "black" in the state next door.    But if you really, really want to make a big deal out of this, think about something first:  If you had not known that Obama had a white mother, would you have questioned, even for a moment, that Obama was a black man?  By every superficial physical characteristic that we use to determine race, Obama is black.  The fact that he identifies himself as black, as do most other people, except for those who seem to have a problem with his being black, only adds further support.|`|XwPlFK7zaa	Yes,Im glad Im not the only one that has thought this.Hes both white and black so why do they say"Hes the first African-American President"??

AA10283080	Here in Pennsylvania where we get loads of snow yearly and know how to deal with it we don't always salt and plow the roads right away. Plowing the roads pushes some of the snow down which packs it and makes it very slippery. Loading salt onto it only melts it and then when the salt disappears it freezes again making it even more slippery.  If it's snowing hard there's no reason for salting the roads since it will only be covered up and make for more problems so plowing and salting the roads isn't always the answer to snow. Careful driving is though.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	They started gritting but then the snow came down so fast the grit and salt were being covered so there wasn't any point in carrying on. Just shows how dangerous bendy-buses are in a skid though!  Edit: Oh dear! someone isn't very happy! I can thumb down 5 times? I didn't do it once! Never mind, the decent people on here know me as a very fair minded person.|`|5589fbd695adfa2721fe85c5288a8fb9aa	ha ha Boris is a compleate numpty, he was on the news last night telling us that there was no point in buying in snow ploughs as we dont see snow all that often in London..... the news reported had asked him why London had come to a stand still lol!|`|nHMbyeG1aa	The thing is that when they grit the roads, people can blame accidents on the salt and sue the council.    This is the exact reason why they don't grit pavements. If people slip, they can blame the grit and the council will be responsible.    However, if snow and ice cause accidents, it is classed as "an act of God" so no one is responsible.|`|8tcaTrIvaa	It is a good time to remember the good old days and the success of ancient.

If you do the things right,  for the right things, in the right time and with the right tools, everything will be resolved in no time.|`|JWPighxzaa	There are two possibilities:    We could spend a lot of money on snow ploughs and leave them unused for 17 years in every 18    Or we could include driving on snow & ice in the driving test.  Then people would not be able to drive badly and blame it on the weather.|`|Y46YE1e2aa	Put this fall of snow into perspective how on earth the country came to an abrupt halt is beyond me to understand news broadcast that I  actually watched gave pronouncement that the snow was deep, they showed films of people walking and the snow was not high enough to cover the shoes they wore, now in 1947 when the real heavy snow fall came along it was understandable for everything to stop snow in many places reached well over three feet as a young boy I could not see over the top of the snow where I lived.  .this time not even coverig the ground in many places.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	The double time sounds about right.

WHY DIDNT THEY GRIT THE ROADS IN LONDON     I DONT KNOW AND IM NOT THAT BOTHERED AS I HAD MY KIDS OFF SCHOOL YESTERDAY AND TODAY     so how long do i get on the naughty step for this (and can i make it more naughty when i get there..?)|`|FD8I4zthaa	The gritters were out at their maximum capacity.    Consider: Would you rather spending more on your local taxes to keep a large fleet of gritters purchased and maintained for use every 18 years, or sufffer a day of disruption every 18 years?    I bet you'd be the first on here complaining!|`|RKUrIHI5aa	The roads in London WERE gritted. Grit prevents roads from freezing, it does not stop snow from falling or settling. Grit is not some mystical cure-all.    Please at least make an effort to establish fact before jumping on whatever band wagon takes your fancy.    http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/a...|`|oMCiOD1gaa	We Brits are very good at blaming others when with a little thought we can solve the problem ourselves. Just fit some snow chains on your car and you can drive anywhere in safety.
rIm9yUNfaa	Actually before israel take shape, Muslims, Christians and Jews were living in peace in Palestine. But after WW2 Zionists attacked Palestine because they believed that Palestine only belongs to Jews because their God promised those lands to them and no one else have right to live there. And it is not only Palestine! They believe that their promised lands are lands between Nile river (in Egypt) and Forat river (in Iraq) and those two blue lines at top and bottom of israel flag are symbols of those two rivers .  Under pressure of other nations, they forced to deny their intention for occupying other lands but as you see there is always conflict between israel, Lebanon and Syria (in past decades they were in war with Egypt as well but since Egypt government is on their side right now, they prefers to focus on other countries first but in future there will be war between israel and Egypt for sure )  Israel policy is to occupy lands slow but steady so they dont like to have peace because for them, peace means end of expansion. First they emblaze the flames of war, then they begin propaganda and after that they expand their territory a little bit after that they become calm for a while and then repeat that cycle again.     http://sites.google.com/site/falastinel7...    In the current conflict, israel always talk about Hamas rocket attacks into israel but they never tell anyone that they blocked Humanitarian Aids of UN and other charity groups (include food, water, medicine, cloth and fuel) for Gaza!  As a result of their besiege, Palestinian civilians began starving and so many of them became sick by drinking dirty and unpurified water and died in hospitals because of lack of medicine and medical equipments.  Lack of fuel resulted in massive blackout in Gaza for months.  after all these cruelties, Hamas lost its patience and attacked israel with home made rockets which were unguided, short range and extremely in effective in destroying targets.  When they did so, israel began massive propaganda and asserted that Hamas broken the truce and attacked israel civilian areas and for raising world commiseration, you always hear that Hamas rockets strike schools, hospitals and kindergartens, but thats really questionable.    --------------  *Note that israel have one of the most advanced laser anti-missile systems which could detect and eliminate any flying object in israel sky in just few seconds. Now why they dont use this system is my question!    --------------  After well propaganda and getting enough credit from their allies for attacking Gaza, they began their massacre in the name of self defense, also they prohibited access of reporters into Gaza to prevent the world become aware of their massacre.  In 22 days of invasion they dropped more than 10000 tons of bombs and shells over Gaza (just imagine!)   They also dropped white phosphorus bombs (which is an unauthorized weapon) massively over Gaza which burned hundreds of civilians including kids.   They attacked schools, universities, residential buildings, factories, shops and farms with missiles and bombs (which arent comparable with Hamas rockets), asserting that Hamas use those buildings for military causes (note that those hospitals and schools were under control of UN and UNRWA).  But when protests around the world against israel assault expanded, they halted their attacks for while and focused on propaganda to divert protestors minds from their crimes and getting more credit from their allies.   ----------------  *Note that after their so called cease fire, they kept Humanitarian Aids blocked which resulted in death of hundreds of wounded civilians in hospitals.  ----------------    And they still attack Gaza from sky sea and ground, but all you hear in the news is that Hamas attacked israel with rockets!!!    -----------------------  WARNING!

He can only have his administration assist in peace talks and  make recommendations .   No lasting peace can be achieved while the Palestinian people are represented by terrorist organizations such as Hamas. If fellow Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia were to really want to help the Palestinians  they would be willing to let the Palestinian people settle in land that they control  which is not disputed and leave Israel alone. The land that the Palestinians now occupy  ( Gaza ) is part of Israel.|`|ZThrhNDpaa	He said he's going to listen rather than tell everyone what to do, so it's a start. He admitted that Americans are always too ready to jump in and start trying to run things before they know what's going on. He showed respect for the arab leaders and Islam which seemed sincere but also showed that he wasn't going to go soft on extremists. He said Israel's security was paramount but he supported a (i think he said 'contiguous') palestinian state. I'm not sure but that might mean no settlements- which everyone knows would be the big step to solve the problem. And it is only the Americans who could really apply that sort of pressure- i hope that is what he was talking about.    Anyway, so far so good. We'll all just have to wait and see what progress is made.|`|ahAOjZ9Vaa	N-O     This Obama is just like the rest. Don't expect anything new from him and that will help the Palestinian citizens.

Enfim, n?o estou pregando nenhuma restri??o contra a televis?o e os programas que s?o passados pelas emissoras, pois eu mesmo assisto. S quero que as pessoas n?o se limitem nas noticias e programas de apenas um veculo de comunica??o antes de formar uma opini?o e aceitar tudo que  nos repassado. Vamos ler diversos jornais, revistas, livros etc, para evitarmos de sermos influenciados sem que percebemos.|`|db92a14c77478b830646d233a86c9066aa	n?o s modificou o comportamento humano depois de 50 anos!!!!!  na sua forma de impor tal e tal marca (marketing)$$$$$$$$$$$$  na mentalidade agressiva dos adolescentes emprestada das imagens agressivas da televis?o  e pela sua imensa lavagem cerebral nesta sociedade consumista|`|c487b38868e1f3c08c3fed55c5175baaaa	 como uma escola, as pessoas veem e aprendem o que o que a televis?o transmite.|`|92dfb6cebbc070deaaf065bb787e188faa	Infelizmente as pessoas n?o s?o educadas para pensar, em nossas escolas ensinam filosofia e n?o a filosofar.

Assim sendo, as pessoas mais cultas s?o menos susceptveis  influncia televisiva, enquanto pessoas com baixo nvel de instru??o s?o bem mais passveis de serem influenciados pela televis?o.

O que lamento  que a maior emissora de tv do pas n?o procura explorar da melhor forma, em seus principais programas, entre eles as novelas.

AA11238146	Apparently, Lebanon's President Lahhud is now willing to commit the Lebanese Army to assist Hezbollah if Israel sends in tanks.  Israel will likely send in tanks to destroy Hezbollah's arsenal of Zelzal and Fajr missiles because their range puts major Israeli cities at risk.  Other Shiite countries may assist Hezbollah directly or by supplying weapons, these countries include, Syria, Iran, Bahrain, parts of Pakistan and Yemen.  Sunni countries will likely not join the conflict although they also have a goal to annihilate Israel.  Therefore, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Emirates will probably not participate unless some event occurs such as the bombing of Mecca (Kaaba) and Medina or the destruction of the Al-Aqsa mosque and Qubbat as-Sakhrah in Jerusalem.  The rest of the world may attempt a diplomatic solution but diplomacy will not likely be successful because of the advanced weaponry now ibeing used by Hezbollah.|`|AA11788388	Dang, who's the ueber guy who decides who gets which strip of land, and based on what facts, not just some biblical hear-say...    Of course, if always someone is digging in my backyard with the permission of somebody who has nothing to do with my land, I would also get mad and react in some way to it.    I think, as long as ANY group of people is so biased and using the 'poor -me-crybaby-genocide-survivor' song, there will always be people be running with tissues to dry up tears, even though these tears might not have come from that reason.    so...my thoughts, right now?

Too many Lebanese civilians(over 140) have died just for Israel to get back the abducted soldiers, but we all know that is an excuse to destroy Lebanon and create a 30km buffer zone, Hezbollah rocket launch sites are permitted to continue firing because this is what Israel wants, a reason.    I am not a supporter of Hezbollah, and I dont agree that one Country should have the right to illegally destroy another....the only way Israel can feel safe would be to resolve the Palestine issue which is the cause of terrorism all over the World, because of this people in India, Indonesia, USA, Britain, Afghanistan, Iraq are being terrorised.  President Bush refuses to acknowledge the fact that innocent Lebanese are dying instead he chooses to say like an id@ t that a sovereign country has the right to defend itself....|`|cd0146559e85edfd425863497fa4b9b0aa	Study both sides of the issue.

Give peace a chance. There are no simple answers that any one will ever find better than that one. In the end after the slaughter on both sides, it will come to the leaders of the world  again. You can not flourish when you war. It ain't easy,no question. But so often in life the good stuff comes from the things you do that are the hardest.   War is a short cut to emotions rather than communication. Often short cuts lead you to places you weren't headed to. Lets take the long road, and talk, be respectful and understand there are always going to be different people with different ideologies.That to get where we need to go, in anything,you have to take the first step.Someone needs to have the courage to take that step and have faith that when you lead gently , something actually good can come of it. We can not as the human race continue to live in a state of chaos. It serves well for reptilians with elitist agendas., but not the majority of  the people of this great planet.

Great just what a country wants. Money that comes with a cult.    Also why is she adopting a boy that already has a father? She should have given the money to the child's dad so HE could raise his own child. There are kids out there that have NO family at all left.  Angelina also did the same a took a child that had a grandmother who wanted to raise the child but didn't have the money.

It's so narcissistic, they take the children from their homes, from extended family and culture (unless the area is endangered, then, how do you choose one child to save?) I heard of it yesterday and thought, It's like the new slavery. Taking these children from their "Roots", their culture, and using then like props. I know the industry has a problem with this kind of behavior but it seems very selfish. Like, "I want one!"...I'm so wonderful! I adopted a third world baby! (and ignore children in America, why not adopt a medically needy American child?...oh, less press...or an American town in need of assistance, a school a family...). Or, it it must be Africa (why not central America?) Why not bring some income earning trade to the community or spend money for water and farm equipment, why not have a village sing your praises?   Maybe the gift of a lifetime for ONE child (or two)...but it seems to fall short of everything except press potential.

El aspecto que hoy posee el tan caracterstico smbolo navide?o, debi su origen al arte del caricaturista norteamericano Thomas Nast. De 1863 a 1886 el Santa Claus regordete, de mejillas coloridas, de larga barba blanca y de aspecto risue?o y simptico fue el centro de atraccin de la revista Harpers Weekly y de all salto a las vidrieras de los grandes centros comerciales.    Santa Claus o Pap Noel es un personaje inspirado en un sacerdote cristiano de etnia griega llamado Nicols, que vivi en el siglo IV en Anatolia, en los valles de Licia.    http://www.canaltrans.com/historia/santa...    Yo sinceramente prefiero a Los Santos Reyes Magos, porque santa era un viejo gordo y barrign que amenazaba con traer carbn a los ni?os que no se portaran bien. Adems Los Santos Reyes Magos son parte de mi cultura, no un invento trado por los de habla inglesa... pero esa es mi opinin.    ?Santa es Satn!    ?Se han preguntado alguna vez por qu Santa y Satn nunca han sido vistos en el mismo lugar al mismo tiempo? La razn es que Santa es Satn disfrazado. Lo mismo que Superman y Clark Kent.     Estas son Las Diez Razones Principales Por Las Que Santa Es en Realidad Satn:     1. Santa es un anagrama de Satn.   2. Ambos viven en temperaturas extremas (Santa en el Polo Norte, Satn en el Fuego Eterno del Infierno).   3. Ambos saben si te has portado bien o mal.   4. Si eres malo, Santa te da un pedazo de carbn, y Satn te hace sentar en carbn ardiente.   5. Satn tiene sus legiones y ayudantes cornudos, Santa tiene elfos y renos.   6. Ambos visten de rojo.   7. Santa es conocido como San Nicols, Satn es conocido como el Viejo Nicols.   8. Ambos existen en leyendas y culturas muy diversas.   9. Santa es real... de la misma manera que Satn.   10. Ambos tratan de atraer a los jvenes, Santa con regalos, Satn con promesas de diversin.   ?En el fondo no es tan descabellado! ;-)
