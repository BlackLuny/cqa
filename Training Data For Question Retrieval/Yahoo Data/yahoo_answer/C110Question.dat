20090128184322AAqMFCb	Politics & Government;Politics	So-called "socialism" vs. "the rich get richer, the poor get poorer". Which is it?	Republicans, please engage me in a discussion about this as I've never heard any Republican in the media address this conflict. How do you (Republicans) think pure capitalism works? Doesn't it ALWAYS leave people out? Do you really believe that people who aren't rich just don't work hard enough or somehow or other their plight is their fault? Isn't that at the heart of the Republican argument for always supporting business over the middle class and the poor? Doesn't business profit by using labor profitably (not necessarily "fairly")? Isn't that why unions came about in the first place (even if unions have now been bastardized into something else)? I'm serious. I'd like to hear the other side of this. "Redistributing wealth" is seen by some as an attempt to mediate the gap between rich and poor because economic success is not a level playing field. What would you, Republicans, do about folks who are too ill, uneducated, lack access, have irresponsible parents, etc., etc. who never get a chance to get out of their poverty? How many people have the intellectual and educational ability to confidently choose their own health care plan, investments, tax matters, insurance, etc., etc.? I think over and over of the scams that are out there and the people they take advantage of. How does the Republican platform plan to address the kind of people who fall prey to scams--the kind of people who just don't have the ability to improve their lives through capitalistic ideals? I really, really want to hear answers--as a respectful skeptic, OK?

I care a lot about prisoners' rights, and I think *most* prisoners are people who made mistakes, people who hit a rough patch in life, people who got stuck in a vicious cycle and couldn't get out. Yeah some of them admittedly are sociopaths, but not all of them.      I want to write to a prisoner, because I know that they don't have much in there, and some of them never get visitors or letters or anything like that. Some people think that's part of the "punishment." But I think our prisons are failing. They're not solely meant to punish, they're meant to make people ready to go back into society. They're horrible places, and I don't think adding to punishment is a reason for NOT writing.      I have a lot to give and this is something small I can do.      I have a PO Box, and I will write to someone who has a life sentence with no chance of parole. Thoughts?

By DANIEL WAGNER, AP Business Writer Daniel Wagner, Ap Business Writer – 2 hrs 12 mins ago      WASHINGTON – The Obama administration is developing proposals to help rescue the banking system that could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars beyond the $700 billion bailout Congress already has approved.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090129/ap_o...       Edit:      More money to bail out the banks?  ( o _ 0 ) What the?!  Oh and I'm sure "Citibank" needs more bailout money?  Wasn't it yesterday that President Obama told these ***holes that it wasn't "alright" to use part of the bailout money (taxpayers money) to purchase a $50 million company jet?      Edit:      Looks like there's going to be some accountability this time:   House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., is interested in Geithner's plans for spending the second $350 billion of the existing bailout, his spokesman said.      "Because we released this money as a result of congressional action, we would like very much to know what it's going to be used for, and what the priorities of this administration will be," said Frank spokesman Steven Adamske. Frank has called for spending tens of billions of the money to address the foreclosure crisis.

20090128100207AAomFwq	Politics & Government;Immigration	How to immigrate a mother and 12 year old sister together without waiting 10 years?	Both the mother and the sister are here in the USA on visitor visas.      Apparently, getting the mother in is fairly short wait time (a few months)      But the sister has an average wait now of 8 - 10 years.  Problem is, she is very young.        Is there any trick to speed this up?  Or find another way?      We thought about getting her on a student visa (F-1) but then she would still need to leave the country to get it; and, apparently junior high schools in our state do not accept F-1's.  So missing school for a couple of years is not a good idea.      The only other option I know of is to get the mother her green card first, and then get it for the daughter using the mothers permanent residency status. but that could still take 1 - 2 years based on average current wait times, and I dont know the real liklihood of that particular scenario.      What else can I do to find a quick solution to get both the sister and the mother here, preferrably both with green cards?

Americans believe so, in case some of you weren't already aware of it - they have another name for the continent called Europe, its '*******'.      Maybe we are *******. Look at the state of France.

I feel for France,  I really do.  Slowly but surely their country is being taken away from under their noses and their liber-tard government is choosing to tow the line of political correctness instead of confronting the issue - islam.      Maybe its time we grew a backbone and stopped hating America, Americans and the war on terror just to appease and win over a handful of bearded wife beaters ?      As Pat Condell clearly says on his youtube videos,  we didn't earn this freedom and its not ours to give up so cheaply - especialy to the new threat in a post-nazi world,  Islam.      In America they're proud of their troops and military and immensely patriotic.  In Britain, we're immensely proud of allowing racist hate speaches being conducted by insecure bearded radical clerics on megaphones.  This tells me Europeans are spineless.      so what do you think ?      Is it true Europeans are spineless people when confronted with the threat of radical Islam ?

PRESIDENT BUSH HAS A GOOD ECONOMIC RECORD   The evidence shows that much of the Democratic Party's criticism of President Bush's economic record is wide of the mark, says Keith Marsden, a fellow of the Centre for Policy Studies.      How does the performance of the U.S. economy really compare with other advanced economies over the eight years of George Bush's presidency? Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden.       Economic growth:      U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000.    The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year).    President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton.    This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.   The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.   Household consumption:      The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005.    The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742). China stood at $1,751.

20090128170956AAG8p2P	Politics & Government;Elections	Do Republicans understand the issue at hand here on the economy?	The unemployment rising isn't just numbers on a page here.      Those are American families people, that now don't have an income. These tax cuts aren't going to do **** if they lose their job. When people don't buy stuff, there's no need to have people making stuff(i.e factory workers) and more and more people lose jobs.      The economy is failing, banks aren't lending, homes are being foreclosed, and people are losing their jobs.      I am not too big of a fan of the stimulus package, and I agree that there is some wasteful spending here, but all in all it is quite necessary, as in the past "big spending" has always helped us get out of recessions.

If I were to get a referal to join the army.  And since I am in the SMART program through my AKO.  I would get the 1000$ because I got a referal, I would also get the promotion.  Then they can dep-out because they haven't left for basic yet.  So I would still have the 1000, I just wouldn't get the other 1000 due to them not leaving. Would the Army take back the money and the promotion?  Obviously they would catch on if I were to have like 10 people join then dep-out but I am just saying like 2-3 people and then them having a "legitament" reason for leaving.

Her estate was in probate at the time of his death. My father died intestate because he did not leave a will, which means his inheritance goes 1/2 to his wife and the other half is split amongst his children(young adults now) that weren't by his wife at the time of his death.      The trustee of the estate(My father's mother's nephew.). Is only speaking with my father's widow and not his children.       We(the children of my father) would like to see the value of the estate and everything in the trust before an up and coming distribution in June so that we will be treated equally. Do you guys know of any document that I could send to try and make this guy release the details of the trust? All we want is to know the value of everything.      We've spoken to law firms but they all want extremely high retainers and we simply want only one single thing since we are direct beneficiaries now.      Thanks for the help.

Well, if people are predicting the economy to go good next year, why are they still putting out massive stimulus bills like this "good economy" isn't going to come? It seems contradictory to say "hey in a year from now we'll be going good" and then turn around and propose billions of dollars like the first bill of 787 didn't even make a dent into it?
20090225145915AAhMZhN	Politics & Government;Government	I'm confused on how Obama is going to reach his goal..?	One of Obama's goals I read in the news last week or 2 weeks ago was cutting our national debt in half by the end of his term. Sounds good? Yes. Is he doing that? Well, in my opinion. No.       If i'm going to cut costs, the last thing I need to do is propose massive "stimulus" bills thats going to add to the very debt i'm trying to cut. Now wait just a second, your probably thinkin, well Obama just enacted 1 package which was the 787 billion right?      Wrong. They just passed in the house thanks to the democrats a 410 billion for "domestic projects". It still has to pass from the senate. Obama also recently proposed yet another massive stimulis bill for 634 billion for health care reform. Now I can't confirm the last one, but I heard he was proposing a 1 trillion stimilus bill for banks. Lets assume the last one is fake but the other 2 are verified.       787+410+634 = 1.831 trillion dollars.      In just a little over a month in office he has managed to add 20% to our national debt to "save the economy" which doesn't even reach the depression levels back in 1929.       How can you in just a single month add 1/5 to our nation trillion dollar debt and then claim your going to be cutting half of it by the end of your term? I hope this man stops spending like crazy.       This last paragraph here you can ingore because its off topic but I thought I would share. There is a man who is russian who predicted the United states would end in the year 2010 due to a civil war. His previous predictions have come true. He believes that the currency or USA dollar will lose 90% of its value. If there is any reason why it would lose so much, I believe its due to Obama's massive overhauls of "borrowing" cash and putting it into the economy like he is. I'll try to find his name if I can, but thats just something off topic and really not relevant.

20090128174045AAGiA54	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	By law, do police officers HAVE to file a report regarding an accident?	Last year in May I was involved in an accident where the other party was at fault, she made a left turn coming out of a hospital right into my car, totaling it. A police officer from the Los Angeles Police Department came to the scene and only gave her a citation for driving without a license and without any insurance! I thought she would have at least had her car impounded.    Anyways, the following day I went to the LAPD's Mission Station in Mission Hills, where the police officer had advised us he was stationed at, to file a report and to at least get a copy of the citation and the report to send it over to the insurance company. After having inquired about this information and being treated in a very unprofessional and rude manner by one of the police officers who was at the front desk, they informed me that the police officer who cited the other party NEVER filed a report, and DIDN'T HAVE TO file a report.   The reason why I'm questioning his actions until now is because I'm thinking of filing a complaint against the LAPD and I would need a report in order to take the other party to court since I have permanent physical injuries to my back, as far as I know the other party simply got away with a citation. Yes her license may have been revoked, but who knows if she's still driving around with no insurance, and the police officer never filed a report because he didn't feel the need to.   Is there website or a form that I need to fill out to file a complaint?

Here are the correct answers.      usa - china.  (sorry guys the drug dealer does not fight the guys that buy the drugs.  You guys know how much stuff the usa buys from china.  If it took place china has no way to invade usa but the usa proved with the usa-japan war if you make them mad enough they can ware a big county like japan out.  They could take china out no doubt.  However a us invasion brings russia and iran into the war as well and then isreal and britian jumps in to get the usa's back it ends up in ww3. which means full scale nuclear war are planet gets destroyed nobody wins.      canada v russia.  If russia attacked canada the usa would be on russia like a fly on poop also resulting in ww3 russia would not even think about it.  This is not because the usa loves canada so much its because its right next door.  That would not happen.  Also canda cant invade russia.  Thats a joke.      Just a few more.  Isreal v Iran.  Again if iran invaded isreal the usa would invade iran and blow them into smitherines and russia and china gets into it to take sides with Iran and it turns into ww3 with nuclear weapons.        The point to this people is you cant just pick one side over the other.  There are to many unknowns that go into this question.  If it were straight up one country v another with no other countrys getting involved.      usa whoops china in a matter of hours.   russia would stomp canada   Turkey would beat denmark   Isreal would cruch Iran. (isreal has all the united state weapons so they would pretty much take any other country out if they wanted to.)   Britain v ireland.  lol  I like irleands chances with all there rolling hills of land.  Britian is not good on taking over another country remember when they tried to invade the usa.  How did that turn out.  Usa ran them outta town.      Final answer with war no one wins.

I know there a lot of questions on here about this but my situation seems a little different. While I was in Navy Bootcamp I had gotten very sick I went to sick call and they thought I had pneumonia. They took a chest x-ray and found a slight case of scoliosis that I did not even know I had. I was told that I needed a liability waiver for this and since it was missed in meps I did not have one. They told me it was a pre-existing condition and the LT. said it was symptomatic so they gave me and Entry Level Seperation for erronous enlistment with an RE-4 since I've gotten out I've accepted that I can't go back in and I've been cleared by an orthopedic specialist to be a firefighter in my home town and have recently passed the fire academy for the second time. I am on a volunteer basis at this point but would like to make a career out of it. The problem is most fire departments disqualify you if you have anything other than an honorable discharge. My recruiter, who is a weasly guy, told me I dont have to state that I ever served in because with an ELS it was like I was never there and technically I never served. I was just looking for advice because I am a honest person and would rather be up front but I've seen from past experiences that once I am upfront about it I am automatically disqualified eventhough I have more qualifications than most, meaning I have already beein certified in firefighter 1, firefighter 2, and a fire inspector but because of the ELS I am not even considered.

I must say I don't understand one bit how anyone can think that tax cuts are the way to go to boost the economy. First of all we tried it already and we know what happened. The issue is not that people do not have money, its that the money is not circulating. And it won't until people feel confident that there are jobs out there. How do tax cuts change anything? I feel infrastructure is the most effective spending. It may take a little longer but will provide the jobs that we need and most importantly unlike tax cuts, we will be left with something to show for it. After all it is our children who will be paying for this, shouldn't they benefit as well? What do you think?

We applied for his residency shortly after we got married, after a year we got his interview in Juarez and we went to it but then they didn't let him come back until after the waiver letter was approved. He was gone for a WHOLE YEAR! I was stuck here paying the mortgage on my own and all the bills and trying to make ends meet..and then I got the letter..they denied him residency! I don't understand why?! He has never done anything wrong, he has a perfect clean record, and has never been in prison for anything! He was never pulled over, the only thing he did wrong was come into the U.S illegally, and he is not the only one to have ever done that. But, ever since he came here, he has only worked and been a good citizen. It's so frustrating! Now I have to sell our house because he can't come back into the U.S and I will probably have to reapply and go through the whole application process, I can't keep paying the mortgage on my own!

My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice? We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness."         Obama is right. He needs to make some laws to toughen up Americans. Again, forget about the economy. What Americans really elected him for was to give terrorists more rights, give money for international groups to perform abortions, and tell private schools when it is safe for kids to attend. Obviously the weather in other parts of the city couldn't have been a reason for the cancellation because the world now revolves around Obama. No more snow days forever!

20090128184905AAdbXRr	Politics & Government;International Organizations	Ok, you Americans - When Do I Get My Apology?	Obama Should Apologise to Iran: Ahmadinejad      by Siavosh Ghazi Siavosh Ghazi – 2 hrs 56 mins ago                                                           AFP/File   Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, seen here in Doha earlier this month, has demanded that US President      TEHRAN (AFP) – Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad demanded on Wednesday that US President Barack Obama apologise for "crimes" committed by the United States against Iran over the past 60 years.      The hardline leader also called on Washington to withdraw its troops from across the world as a proof of Obama's policy of change.      "You were standing against the Iranian people in the past 60 years," Ahmadinejad said during an address in the western region of Khermenshah that was broadcast by state television.      "Those who speak of change must apologise to the Iranian people and try to repair their past bad acts and the crimes they committed against Iran."      As to the troops, he said he expected two kinds of "deep and fundamental" change.      "Meet people, talk to them with respect and put an end to the expansionist policies. If you talk about change it must put an end to the US military presence in the world, withdraw your troops and take them back inside your borders."      Ahmadinejad said the advocates of change must "stop supporting the Zionists, outlaws and criminals."      He called on the United States to "stop interfering in other people's affairs" and said Washington should "let the American people decide their own future ... Stop pressuring them," he added, without saying to what he was referring.      Ahmadinejad said he welcomed change but the "change has to be fundamental."      "If someone wants to talk with us in the language that (George W.) Bush used ... even if he uses new words, our response will be the same that we gave to Bush during the past years," he added.      Tension between Washington and Tehran has been high over the latter's nuclear programme.      Bush refused to hold talks with Iran until it stopped its nuclear work, but on Monday Obama extended a diplomatic hand towards Tehran to break the deadlock.      In an interview with Al-Arabia television, Obama promised to lay a framework for his policy towards Iran.      "As I said in my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.      "It is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of US power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran."      Also on Monday, Washington's UN ambassador, Susan Rice, pledged "direct" support to Tehran if it halts the nuclear programme.      Ahmadinejad said Tehran would "wait, see and listen to what they (US) say and then consider what they do."      "If there is a real change, we will welcome it."       The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany have offered Tehran economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment programme.       But Tehran is pressing on with the work, insisting that its nuclear programme is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation.       The Security Council has already adopted four resolutions -- three of which included sanctions -- requiring Iran to suspend enrichment.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090128/ts_...

And a majority of Americans think this will go into immediate effect, and save and regain the jobs of millions? Not only that, but there are also clips of the Ways & Means Committee talking over the proposed $825 billion stimulus package. Congressman David Camp, a ranking republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, representing Michigan's fourth district, asked Thomas Barthold, the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, how many jobs Obama's new stimulus package will create. His answer is not surprising, "he cannot tell".    Clip can be found here:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG5V30nfW...     Amazing how Obama can run about making promises of 3 + million new jobs when our own House cannot even come up with a decent number!

20090128192225AAqFRKL	Politics & Government;Politics	What is your opinion? And why?	If President Bush lied about the WMD's. First, what proof do you have that he lied? Of course if he did fully lie about that, that would have been a crime. So since you have evidence that he did lie to the American public and the world instead of working on bad intellegence, could you please produce it for all of us to see. If not, then you are the one comitting a crime by slandering a citizen, let alone the President of the United States.    Valerie Plame was no more a super spy that I am. It was proven time and again that she DID NOT meet the standards of the ACT that covers the identities of our covert agents. Also, have you ever stopped and asked yourself this one question? If it was so important that her identity stay secret, why would she send her husband on such a high profile trip as the one he went on to the Sudan? Does that make any sense to you. Oh, and by the way, after that whole controversy started, several members of the KGB said they knew who she was and what see did.    Now if you feel that President Bush should be tried for torture, then you would agree that President Lincoln should have been tried for the conduct of his troops during the Civil War. The Northern troops did far worse to the populace of the South and the the Souther P.O.W.'s that anything we have done during the war on terror. Also, President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeaus corpus. I'm curious as to your though on that. Also, President Roosevelt's creating of the office that was charged with sensoring the media during World War II.    So, according to your standard President Licoln, President Grant, and President Roosevelt are all war ciminals as well...

I used to be a Democrat but left the party due to its lack of courage in bringing impeachment charges against Bush while he was in office.     However, I think (at least I *hope*) that the reason the Democrats didn't bring impeachment charges against Bush is because they wanted to wait until after he left office to prosecute him, for three reasons:  1) As a former president, Bush will no longer be able to claim executive privilege or immunity  2) The Republicans won't be able to b-tch and moan that it's politically motivated  3) The government can continue to function with minimal disruptions    ***NO ANSWERS FROM REPUBLICANS, PLEASE**. Democrats, Independents and other parties. I need some objective opinions. I'm not trying to stifle free speech, but I already know what a Republican responder is going to say ("Bush is a war hero blah blah, the recession is the Democrats' fault blah blah, Kerry and Gore were pu--ies blah blah) so there's no need for you to waste your time in typing a response.

20090128185823AAbXjAg	Politics & Government;Elections	Is it just me? Or, can anbody else NOT find how this $8+billion stimulus plan of Obama's will help....?	With REALLY stimulating the economy at all? I can't see that this has one thing to do with getting people back to work, creating a health care plan that all can afford, or any of the other things we all heard about during the campaigns and elections.      Would it not make more sense, and cost far less, to instantly shut down all of the (to start with) "out-sourced" to India (mainly) call centers, bring these jobs back to the USA and put hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of people right here to back to work? These are jobs that just about anybody who can read,  follow instructions and answer a phone can perform. A great deal of these jobs are already government jobs, therefore, the employees could be covered by the same health care insurance that all government employees share. The ones that are private industry could be given a tax break to help provide insurance for their employees. I can only see this as a "2-fer": Many people working again/many people & their families covered by insurance. Am I missing something here, or is this just too simple & logical for our government to understand?

The Fed govt. will also increase unemployment insurance, food stamps, etc.      Overview of how the $800 billion dollar stimulus will be spent:       http://www.cbpp.org/1-22-09bud.htm       "The state fiscal relief will lessen the degree to which states will have to enact very painful budget cuts and tax increases, both of which have a negative effect on the economy.

20090128185958AAkePZS	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What are all the torts and/or crimes did Tiffany commit in the case below?	Tiffany is late for work one day, as usual. The last time she was late, her boss told her that he would fire her if she was late again. Tiffany is a single mother with 2 kids at home and needs her job to pay the bills and feed her kids. As she is walking down the street, she sees a bicycle laying on Kristi's lawn. Kristi owed Tiffany $80 but had never paid her. Tiffany decided if she were to ride the bike to work, she may not be that late and probably would not be fired. Plus, Tiffany figured the bike was worth about what Kristi owed her and it would be only fair for her to borrow the bike. Tiffany walks into Kristi's lawn, pics up the bike, gets on the bike and rides it to work.    Tiffany makes it to work with just a minute to spare. She jumps off the bike and runs into office building. However, in jumping off the bike, she also flings it down the sidewalk. Michelle, who was not late to work but was outside enjoying a cigarette, saw the bike come flying at her. Michelle tried to move out of the way but was hit in the leg by the bicycle. The result of the incident was a broken leg for Michelle.    Tiffany, not realizing what happened, ran into the office building and made it to her desk just in time. Jolie, a co-worker of Tiffany's, saw Tiffany that morning riding a bike. The bike was  just what Jolie was looking for and asked tiffany about the bike. After talking for a couple minutes, Jolie offered to buy the bike from Tiffany for $100. Tiffany thought she had hit the jackpot and quickly sold the bike to Jolie. Tiffany figured she would give Kristi the $20 difference ($100 for the bike less the $80 Kristi owed Tiffany) and then could use the remaining money to buy her son the new pair of tennis shoes he wanted.    After work was over, Tiffany realized she no longer had transportation home since she sold the bike and no money for the bus, since the bus would not have change for the $100 bill. As she was walking home two men came up behind her and put a gun in her back. They told her that she had to help them "knock over" a liquor store or they would kill her. Tifffany was terrified  and thought she would never see her kids again. She told the two men that she would do as they told her. The three of them walked to the local ABC store. They went into the ABC store. The two men had Tiffany put a fake gin into the face of the cashier while they held a hidden gun on her. Tiffany told the cashier to put all the money in a bag.    After he did so, the the two men grabbed the bag and ran out of the store leaving Tiffany and the cashier standing there. Right then, a police officer walked into the ABC store. The cashier told the officer what happened and the officer arrested Tiffany. The officer took Tiffany to the police station and began questioning her about what happened. Tiffany told the officer EVERYTHING she did that day as described above.

I have a question about the Disneyworld deal for military, where you get a free 5 day admission ticket, and then can buy up to 5 more tickets at $99.00 each.  what the information online says about Reserve/Guard folks is:      "Activated members of the National Guard or Reserves (or if they are not present, their spouses) will need to show proper military identification plus active orders valid between January 1, 2009-December 23, 2009."      Does this mean you HAVE to be on orders when you go to Disneyworld, or does it mean you have to have been on orders between 1 january and 23 December 2009?  I mean, I will have several short periods of active duty time during that window, but most Reserve/Guard folks who are on orders are usually WORKING during that time and not able to enjoy the perks of Disneyworld while they are actually on orders.        Anyway, if any Guard/Reservist have done this program and can chime in, I would appreciate any info.      Thanks.

My daughter's father and I are not together, he is not on the birth certificate because he was late getting to the hospital and did research that well on how to go about getting his name on the certificate. During the pregnancy and now we live two hours away, he sent a total of about $300 while I was pregnant and since giving birth, he has come down to visit, after I threatened him that if he doesn't try more then I will just take it to court, twice in December, and he has given her a total of about $200 since her birth and some outfits. Also, some of the people he lives with smoke weed, he says he doesn't, but who knows. I current;y lives with my parents while I attend college, I'm 19 years old and he just turned 21 in Nov. I have my license, got it when I was 18, and he does not have his. He does have a job and I don't. We both have our HS Diploma's. The two times he has come to visit, he only stayed for 4-5 hours. I think that's all the important facts....do you think he has ANY chance of getting joint custody or anything to where he will not be supervised with my daughter? He is really good with her, but I am not comfortable with him taking care of her without me there because I do know that some of his friends do drugs and I don't want her to be around that. Can you please help me, I am going to be consulting Lawyers also about this, just to see what the odds are so that I am prepared. I live in California too if that helps.

So I just say a CBS documentary 60 minutes and it was about the Illegal settlements being built in the west bank.  Illegal settlers are taking over Palestinian farm land and taking their houses by force.  Settlers are allowed to carry weapons and the Israeli government  permits to build in the west bank.  Every year the settlements grow about 5% in the west bank.   It is considered Illegal by the UN, EU and Israel itself but they are not doing anything to stop them.  Won't this movement interfere with the peace process??  Is this part of the Zionist movement??  How does Israel want a two state solution when this is happening??      it just doesnt make sense to me, maybe someone can clarify this for me      Here is the Documentary, I know most Israelis will consider CBS to be Anti-semite after this one but video footage does not lie.       http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/2...

Local ews article says, "tax cut calls for a $500 break for single workers and $1,000 for couples"     What exactly does that mean? My husband and I are having a debate. He says we will be receiving checks, I said it will be a tax break over a certain amount of time. Meaning, they would not take as many taxes out of our paychecks. I assume that the $500-$1000 tax break will come into affect during tax file time. If you didn't pay in enough they will give you a $500-$1000 tax exemption, For Example; I paid in $600, but should have paid in $800. I wouldn't owe that extra $200 according to the tax cut because it falls within the $1000 allotted for my couple status.

I had to go back to work 3 weeks after my son's death.  No choices here.  The stimulus package says that us working people will see a    "little increase" in their paychecks, but the unemployed will see a significant increase...Geez if you ask me, I might as well go unemployed LOL.  In the meantime, Obama tries to tell me that all these new job will be created, while Circuit City, Home Depot and many other places are cutting back and thousands losing their jobs.  I think it all sounds like just a bunch of business as usual and Obama is not the "change" that he said.  BTW, I did not vote for this man.

20090128202818AA9LnUz	Politics & Government;Politics	What ideas do Republicans have for economic stimulus other than cuttung taxes?	So far the only idea the Republicans have had to stimulate the economy is cutting taxes, a measure which has been proven to be inaffective:      ' The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, has concluded that a corporate rate cut “is not a particularly cost-effective method of stimulating business spending.”[1]  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has found that in terms of stimulating aggregate demand, the “effect of corporate rate cuts is likely small.”[2]  And Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, has rated a corporate tax rate cut as one of the least effective of all tax and spending options in stimulating the economy, estimating that it would generate only 30 cents in economic demand for every dollar spent on the tax cut.[3] "      Since the ONLY idea Republicans have offered has now just been shown to be completely inaffective, and they refuse to stand behind Obama's plan, what do they plan to offer in the future?

Now we blow off $800 billion on ANOTHER stimulus package full of bloody pork that will probably not be as effective as people are hoping for.      If this keeps up they'll be hell to pay.

Our current problems are not the fault of everyone else except people who share your political ideologies. This means, liberals, conservatives under Bush were not the sole reason that we're in this mess. And conservatives, liberals are not responsible for everything wrong with the world, either. All of you guys would benefit from taking a freaking political science class and learning about different poltical ideologies, because most of you don't have a clue. You're such hypocrites, accusing the other guys of what your side does in spades as well.    Also, why does no one realize that party affiliation does not equal a politician's political beliefs? Most Democrats are not true liberals, and most Republicans are not true conservatives.     Blaming everyone else is the reason that our country is in such horrible shape right now. For God's sake, people, grow up and take some responsibility, and realize that poltics (and the rest of life, too) is not just black and white. Your side is not infallible, you can always learn valuable things from those you disagree with, and you can always be constructive rather than insulting in your criticisms.    /end rant

OR what if when you accidentally leave your wallet in your car and your car gets towed and you call a cab to take you to your car and you go in your car to get the money (the person knows he had more than enough money to pay) and the people towing the car had stolen the persons money? what will happen and what can the person do and the cab driver do and what can the person tell the cab driver and or police and what can they do?  but what if the person had the wallet in his car because he left it behind by accident.

I'm still buying properties because now is a buying time.  Just like I am buying stocks.  Sit back and wait for Obama to save you and you'll be poor.  Bad economies are opportunities for wealth to transfer.  Those builders/ developers that were greedy and over built are losing their arses at the moment.

20090128200643AAq2Tbc	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are so many people dependent on politicians?	Everyone's been whining lately about how "the governments not working" and saying America's going down the tubes. First of all, what the hell does that even mean? "America's going down the tubes?" Sounds a little GENERALIZED. We still have the most advanced army, the highest GDP, and the most economic freedom out of any other country BY FAR. Secondly, if people really think our country is on some kind of "decline," why aren't they doing anything? It's all; wah wah, I want Obama to make my life awesome. Take some initiative! Yes, our education system is outdated, but the sh1t about how kids not knowing basic history isn't really their fault just isn't true. Yes, executives should have been monitored, but by the lower employees and other businesses. And YES, our country doesn't have a good image, but that's because WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SELF IMAGE.       If the American people want our country to turn into a socialist sh1t-hole, they can just keep on complaining about what the government isn't doing. If they really want change, WE need to do something.

20090128203945AAmiOKh	Politics & Government;Elections	Does it seem like things in Iraq...?	are going to turn out to be fine?      I don't want people to interpret that as "Bush was right".There is a huge difference between Bush being right and Iraq turning out to be fine.      If Iraq turns out to be fine,that doesn't make it okay for the way the Bush administration led America to war.Lying about WMD's.Lying about the connection with Iraq and 9/11. Making up the bogus "spread democracy" stuff to go into war,which contradicts Bush's "no nation building" campaign message". Both Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice said that Saddam Hussein was not a threat. Finally,the concept of pre-emptive war makes no sense      However,it seems like despite the lies and deception to go into Iraq,it will turn out to be fine      If it does,will that make Bush a good president.I don't see how. The huge spending in Iraq contributed to the deficit.The past eight years have doubled the national deficit.Job losses. The political corruption in the Justice department. The whole outing the CIA agent thing
