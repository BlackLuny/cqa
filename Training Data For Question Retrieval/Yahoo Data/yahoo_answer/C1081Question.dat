I am REALLY fair so I want to use something that works well. I also want something for everyday use at home too because I have heard that protects your skin. I do use moisturizer but no foundation (except for a teensy bit of cover up) So this is what I was thinking,   Everyday:   Neutrogena dry touch 45      Beach:   Neutrogena dry touch 80      I would use this after I cleanse and moisturize. I thought these would be the best for non-greasyness and maximum protection. I have never use neutrogena before so does it work? Does another product work better? I also am only 16 so I don't need age defying stuff or anything. Anyways I think I am babbling. What works for you sunscreen wise??   Thank you!!!

20090202165736AASOKmS	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What's your opinion on pretty skin tight clothing on skinny people, but with big breasts?	The typical bottoms: jeans, skirts, pants.    I'm just wondering about the top. I think that anyone who is not quite thin shouldn't wear skin tight clothing because it is verrrry unflattering. I think that tight tops look almost vulgar on heavier people. Loose tops and blouses are so much more flattering and look much prettier.      And on thin girls, tight clothing looks almost natural and not obvious that it's skin tight. They have the option, for the most part, of wearing tight aaaand loose tops without looking vulgar.      However, I am very lean and thin on the stomach but I have pretty large breasts. Is it still okay for me to wear tight tops? They would still be classy and show no cleavage... but still tight, therefore it doooes emphasize my boobs compared to looser tops and blouses.      What do you think? I just don't want to look the least bit vulgar, yet I don't like loose tops and blouses and, with my larger breasts, it doesn't flatter me so much unless I wear a belt or tuck it in.      Any opinions/advice would be very helpful.   By the way, I DID NOT mean to offend anyone by asking this question.      Thank you!

What can I do to ensure my hair grows... hopefully a bit faster and healther.   2. What foods should I eat while I'm dieting.   3. What workouts are best? I'm tredmilling for an hour right now.   4. Any advice? Personal experiences to motivate me?   Thanks :D         I'm a really gorgeous girll.... but I've completely killed myself.   A few years back, I went into depression and that took a big toll on my life.   Then, when I got out, I stopped socializing with people because I didn't trust anyone.... still don't and keep to myself mostly. How can I open up to people more?   Also.... then I strived so much for academic achievements, worked super hard to get the grades I have today but I destroyed my body and became over weight. Now, I'm trying to balance things. I'm gonna come home and work out for an hour each day and then do my work and leave all else till later. In my spare time, I'll do my favourite things, talk to friends, msn and all.   Also, I used to suffer from trichotillomania - still am but I'm trying to overcome it. I'm not going on any medication or anything but I will put an end to this myself, for sure. But now my hair is completely destroyed, a lot shorter... and damaged due to the straighteners and all I used for all these years (my hair is super curly).      I want to create a new me.   I always want to be the best at everything I do so I am gonna still strive to get good marks.   Also, I love to look beautiful as it makes me feel more confident about myself so I'm gonna try to lose all the flab I have. ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT? WHAT FOODS TO EAT?   Also.... I know that you can't make your hair grow exceedingly fast... however, are there anythings I can do to make sure it grows longer?      Please help me.   Thanks. :)

Another note is that I live in Florida, so it's barely cold here.      What I have in my closet includes:         Hoodies   -Printed Lightweight Zipper-Ups [Plaid, Zebra, Etc]   -White Hollister Hoodie   -Blue Abercrombie Hoodie      ...where can I find a black zipper-up? I've been looking everywhere, and all i've found was at American Apparell, too pricy :P                  Tees:   -ALOT of band tees [All Time Low, Blessthefall, Escape the Fate, Metro Station, etc]   -Colorful graphic tees [Note: I'm not so into the whole super-colorful look, so is there any way I can still wear this but not so much brightness?]   -A few strapless tops   -Solid button down long sleeves [Blue, Red, Green]   -Lots of tank tops from Delia's [Striped, patterned, etc]   -Those wierd "Sugar Lips" [They are very comfortable :)]   -Solid tank tops blah blah blah      "Nicer" Shirts:   -Plaid button-downs [I've been upsessed with them lately]   -Off-White Ruffled Shirt   -Striped Over-Poofy Sleeve Shirt-Dress [i usually wear it with leggings and boots]   -Long Sleeve Abercrombie Button-Down      Dresses [Not A Big Fan Of Them]   -Numerous dresses [in purple, black and white, brown etc]      Bottoms   -Soffe shorts [Who can't have any?]   -Abercrombie Plaid Skirt   -1-3 Denim Shorts.      ...I'd like to get more skirts, where can you get plain colored ones?      Jeans   -Skinnnnnnnny Jeans [I get them from Parallel and Target]   -A pair of ripped Jeans      I'm okay on jeans.         Bags-      -Juicy Silver Mini Bag   -A few ugly beachy bags   -Jansport backpacks?   -Silver Mini Bag      I'd really like to know where you can get a black oversized bag, like some celebrities have. They are really nice looking :]      Bracelets   -Numerous handcrafted bracelets   -LEGIT Jac Vanek bracelet   -Lucky Eye Bracelet [They are pretty nifty looking.]   Alot more, too many to type.   -Those Jelly Bracelets      Shoes   -Black, White, and Pastel Green Converse   -Glitter black flats   -Cupcake Flats [They're really cute, I got them from Marshalls O:]   -Flip flopssss      I'd like to grow on and get a new pair of "nicer" shoes, hmmm?      Scarves/Hats/Etc      -Black Beanie [I don't wear it]   -Where to get a nice scarf? I love the plaid ones      Well, I don't think i've left out anything major. Please help if you can, i'd like to know how to mix up some of my stuff or add some basics to update my look :D

I do not, however, want to look horrible, and while i can often make judgements on these such things for other people i've had difficulty deciding if it will look good on me specifically. My skin tone is very fair, and I have blue eyes. My hair now is my natural color which is a redish-dirty blonde.  Also, my hair is very healthy, I don't obsessively condition it, just every other day and I use a Garnier Fructis mask about once a week for five minutes or so. So will bleaching completely mess up my hair, forcing me to cut it a ton? I'm beginning to write a novel here, so I'll try to finish it up.        Here's a picture of myself for a visual:  http://i556.photobucket.com/albums/ss4/t...       If I do this I'm thinking I will use the stuff called White Out that you can get at Hot Topic.  If anyone has used it, is it good stuff? I heard that it works really well. If not, is there something else/better that you know of? Unfortunately going to a salon is not an option.  Though I cut my own hair, so i'm not one to go to such a place often anyway.      Last, if I do this is it necessary that I also get something to bleach my eyebrows? You can sort of see them in the picture, they're pretty dark, darker than my hair. Like I said, I'm not going for a completely natural look, but i don't want to look horrid (though I guess that's relative). If I should bleach them, how light should I make them, and with what should I bleach them?      Thanks so much for any answers/opinions! :)

In the beginning of my training, my professor talked about us having the ability to get a job at a salon while being a student.   She'd stated that after this school year is over, we would be able to get a job at a salon as a Junior Cosmetologist/Student with a release contract with the clients stating that they understood we were students and not licensed professionals yet.      My question is ...    Is this actually correct and allowable in NYS?   Our professor isn't from NY, so naturally I'd question her viability on the matter.         Is that possible?

So, I went and bought Pantene Pro-v 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner.   The Burts Bees was super expensive (and it screwed up my hair so I wasn't going to use it again) so my mom wouldn't let me get separate shampoo and conditioners.   She says I buy to many hair products, so I'll probably be using this until it runs out.   I haven't used it yet, could I possibly take it back? I got it from Target.      And, will 2 and 1 do my hair any justice? Or will it get unhealthier? I use hot tools about every other day, sometimes every three days.   Thanks :)      **The shampoo/conditioner I bought is Pantene ProV ice shine.   I wash my hair once a week.   Please don't say it's gross, it's actually good for my naturally curly hair. If I wash it anymore than that it will dry out and become brittle.
