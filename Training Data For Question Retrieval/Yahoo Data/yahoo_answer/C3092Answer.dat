27Gx5JUZaa	In my opinion going to school to work in those fields in vegas, is pointless and a waste of time. I've worked in vip services & i have also been a blackjack dealer. Everyone who as a degree & ive worked with, regrets it! Once you get into the casino industry you'll see that its really about experience & who you know. I work in a very well known casino...Working in vip services i was offered a job as a Casino Vip Host. My training for dealing blackjack was payed for & it only took around 3 weeks. Like any job it has its ups & downs. The money is good but getting there is whats tough. Esp at this time where ppl r loosing their jobs or getting dropped from full-time to extras.. in all positions & ppl who have years of experience. i hope that working those jobs wasnt your goal when earning ur degrees..either way. good luck & really look into it.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	why are you spending money on a degree if you plan on dealing.  It will be worthless.  Even if you plan on moving up into casino mgmt, it won't help you.  It's about who you know, who you are, and the job you do.<br>  <br>  As for dealing, it's more fun when customers have a lot of cash to spend.  Even then there is about a 75% drop out rate within the first 3 months.  After you ever experienced "assisting" someone losing their savings.  It's not an easy thing to be a part of.  <br>  <br>  Now with people aren't spending freely it's even worse.  You aren't getting your hours.  The casinos keep changing how you are paid, keeping more for themself and less for you.|`|s7seaaPkaa	i agree ^
