The presence of some water will improve efficiency somewhat by translating heat into pressure in the form of steam hence exerting a greater force on the pistons but there are many downsides.       The steam will react will the oil, fuel and the metal such that it's likely that the engine would not last very long.       Not all of the reactions are bad though, if there are any products of incomplete combustion, the steam could via steam reformation translate those products into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, whether or not the hydrogen would then participate in combustion at the right time in the engine cycle is questionable, at the wrong time and the secondary combustion could damage the engine.       Also keep in mind that if there are hydrogen and carbon monoxide present, iron acts as a catalyst to create carbon monomers (CH2) which readily combine to form polymers, depending on the probability of a chain initiating reaction and a chain terminating reaction, this could produce anything from methane through solid plastic.   Engines don't run very well if their cylinders are filled with solid plastic.    You could probably inject some water with positive results and racers do this with both gasoline and diesel engines but restraint would be advisable.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	No.  There's no energy input.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Are you joking here?

h2LmAM0Baa	The accidental release of a tsunami of coal ash and water just before Christmas across 300 acres and several waterways in eastern Tennessee is a timely reminder that, as a source of energy, coal has drawbacks. National policy must be based on a clear-eyed assessment of coal's real, overarching costs.    The sludge spill  at 1 billion gallons, probably the nation's biggest  resulted from a breach in a holding pond at the Kingston Fossil Plant, a Tennessee Valley Authority generating plant 40 miles west of Knoxville on the Emory River. No one was killed, but the approximately 5-foot wall of ooze damaged at least 42 properties, destroying three homes.    It's also fueling worries about water and air quality, and for good reason. Fly ash, a byproduct of burning coal,, contains significant levels of arsenic, lead, mercury and selenium, which can cause cancer and neurological problems. In a separate report issued last year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency concluded that, over a decade, dumps containing fly ash leached heavy metals into the groundwater of 67 towns in 26 states.    The Tennessee dump is among more than 1,300 across the United States, according to The New York Times. None is federally regulated, and while some states have regulations, most of the dumps are unregulated and unmonitored.|`|LnCIs86Caa	C'mon people.  Most of these "facts" aren't facts at all. They're lies propagated by the media and politicians despite being proven inaccurate because they're pushing a socialist agenda and basically reaching for ratings. Objective news reporting has fallen by the wayside long ago.  For example, not only are polar bears NOT in decline, but they're numbers are higher than they've been in decades.  And the fact that glaciers are melting all over the world?  Actually, there are almost as many that are advancing.  All it takes is a little research to see for yourself.  Anything you see in any form of news media must be taken with a grain of salt.    Try this for a topic: global warming very well could be natural.

I am beginning to understand where their reasoning went wrong in saying that co2 is causing the oceans to become acidic when it is actually the out gassing of co2 that is causing them to become less alkaline. Their thought process seem to invert things in some way from reality to achieve conformity with political correctness.

1KGXts5Daa	When you say "gas" I assume you are referring to "natural gas", as supplied to some buildings for purposes of providing hot air, hot water, and for cooking.<br>  <br>  You have made it very clear that yours is an all electric home, therefore it is highly unlikely that there are even gas lines serving your house.  Also, since natural gas is lighter than air, it will rise.  You said that the odor was downstairs only.  You are not smelling natural gas.<br>  <br>  There is a slight possibility that what you are smelling is propane (from an outside source, like a barbeque or propane heater).  <br>  <br>  Propane is heavier than air.  It smells similar to natural gas because the odorant that is added to propane is very close in aroma to the odorant added to natural gas (both are designed to smell like sulfur, or rotten eggs).<br>  <br>  The likelihood of there being a carbon monoxide leak in your home is very low.  You don't have the things that are most likely to put out CO.<br>  <br>  My guess is that it the odor is originating from outside your home, and is possibly not even a petroleum product.<br>  <br>  If the odor persists or gets stronger, or if anyone in the house begins feeling nauseated, lightheaded, sleepy, or begins to have a headache - call 911 for the fire department to respond.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, contact your local utility company.

F0UF9DDeaa	Temperate rain forests are found on the western edge of North and South America, where moist air from the Pacific Ocean drops between 60 and 200 inches of rain a year. Unlike the tropical rain forest, the temporate rain forest has seasonal varition, with summer temperatures rising to about 80 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures dropping to near freezing. In the northernmost regions, winter may be cold enough for some ice and snow.<br>  <br>       Although this rain forest has layers of tall, medium, and low growing vegetation, the cool winters limit the numbers and kinds of life forms that live here. Compared to the tropical rain forest, the temperate rain forest has a less complex ecology. For example, the topmost layer of the temperate rain forest on the western edge of North America is dominated by four kinds of tall coniferous trees.|`|8668f05e854dcb2756138e1a4373d74faa	i just had that lesson a lil while ago..i'm pretty sure the only difference is that the temperate rain forest obviously gets more rain.. it like has the characteristics of a temperate forest but the conditions like a rain forest..i'm prty sure u mite wanna verify that tho lol :)|`|svfBYHFfaa	FOREST ARE FOREST where ever they maybe located sonny, the difference comes between the FLORA and FAUNA|`|In9gUd38aa	forests are smaller,dryer,and have more woodland-type trees and contain animals like rabbits,snakes,sometimes wolfs,and sometimes crocs (if near water). rain-forests are also known as jungles,and have more exotic animals like tigers,parannahs,tree-frogs,anacondas,an... more.|`|NeOaPs6Jaa	The amount of precipitation.|`|5KZZtGnpaa	Maybe altitude?|`|NH6euVYQaa	a temperate forest is located in non-tropical climates, such as the deciduous forests in North America.<br>  <br>  A temperate rain forest is a rain forest located in a region further from the equator, such as mid-South America|`|lwNCc0PCaa	forest is a jungle where it rains less.rain forest is a place where it rains a lot but the water doesn't get collected and it is only found near the equator|`|defae93221649626bf40294eaaa8ae9daa	Rain I think so

Such as when metal prices sky rockets, all I heard in the business section of the Vancouver Sun was how good a company was doing recycling electronics and extracting the valuable metals found inside. <br>  <br>  Recycling takes place everyday, it's a part of life; leave a chopped log out for x amount of days and it won't be there in the same form anymore. <br>  <br>  In essence, recycling is not only a part of life but it's life itself. It helps clean up our planet of unwanted goods and creates anew. Recycling are the foundations of nature. Things grow, die, decompose, and out from the decomposed material rises new life. That's the beauty of this world, nothing is every wasted. Eventually, everything is recycled, and as humans we must clean up our own environment the way nature does; humans recycling doesn't benefit nature, it benefits us. Given enough time, humans will eventually vanish off the face of the world; so, it doesn't really matter to nature or the planet, it matters to us.<br>  There was a quote that goes something like, "It's amazing, despite all the advances of the human society, we are still animals." And without a doubt, I agree.|`|UzZyxTtEaa	Throw it in a recycling bin. and then tell your teacher about it.|`|wHsbUeCKaa	well, idk, but dont forget to print it on scrap paper ;)|`|QwCsFKLQaa	watch this,   <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.storyofstuff.com</a>|`|lPfjHn3Aaa	Have a look at www.wrap.org.uk very good recycling site should help you wrap it up.....
