20090130203333AAKjOrX	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I am curious about insurance in regards to a leased vehicle.?.?	I wanted to lease a vehicle, but I do not have enough credit established.  My father said he'd cosign, but when we went to sign they said that it would cost more if we were both on the lease.  So, my dad signed alone for the vehicle.      Since I am the driver, can I be the only one with insurance on the vehicle?  Or will the leasing company require my father, the one not driving the car, to get insurance too since he's the person who leased the vehicle?

20090130144915AA0UAZF	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Lincoln	Brake line issues with Lincoln Mark VII?	I have a constant brake fluid leak from my 1989 Lincoln Mark VII which uses an ABS.  The leak from what I can tell is happening between the hydraulic line from below, and where it comes into the master cylinder.   Now could the leak be caused by a faulty seal in the line or the connector between the two, or would it have to be a busted master cylinder?       I took it to a guy who said there are seals inside of the lines but they are only to keep air out and not to keep the fluid in, but as always around San Diego threres a few workshops that aren't staffed with the best of technicians.  The whole keeping air out thing seemed questionable to me so we set out sights on replacing the cylinder anyways instead of examining the hydraulic lines (Tech then noticed he didn't have the part so he couldn't replace it.)      I'm about to go grab a new cylinder but know this community has a lot of experienced people.  Should I check/replace the seals first before replacing the cylinder or is the tech actually right and the leak is from inside the cylinder itself?      (Side note, there is the Hydraulic line, the connector, then the master cylinder, but the connector comes attached to the cylinder apparently so you can't just buy one or something like that.)

20090130174932AABQNKj	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Custom bike regulations UK?	This isnt exactly a custom bike but rather a modification to an existing one, i thought that the question i asked would redeem the most views/answers.      k, pretty simple really. I have a 1987 GPZ900r and want to remove the sub-frame to make it a single seater and give it a bit of a street bike look. I am a fabricator welder with alot of sheet metal experience also, so making a new frame etc is no probs.       The main issue i see (assuming i'm re-fitting indicators/correct sized number plate etc.) is:  Since i am changing from a two seater to a single seater sub-frame, the seat unit will be slightly stubby, resulting in the rear wheel protruding from the back of the bike substantially more than any other part. Would there be any issues with this bike passing an MOT, and if so where can i get the technical info required to do a mod like this?      This may seem like a stupid question to some, but i'm sure i've read a regulation that when the seat unit is so high from the rear wheel, the wheel cannot protrude from the back of the bike by any more than a specified distance.      Thanks in advance and please no answers from outside of UK as any other countries regulations will considerably differ.

20090130184123AAZKgN4	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Question about digital radios?	I would like to know if there is a digital tuner that can be placed in line with the existing factory radio for cars. I have had a number of clients ask about this and I have been unable to locate any information on the subject other then the FCC and why they want digital signals. If someone has information on where I can get in line receivers or what can be done let me know. many of my clients don't like the idea or removing the old radio to install an after market. a lot of it has to do with the controls on the dash and steering wheels. Thanks for you help.

20090130181552AAUHqJ5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Anyone know how to fix windshield wipers, or how much it might cost to replace them?	Yesterday morning, I started my car, with the defrost, and began scraping the ice off.  After i finished the car, I started my wipers to get the extra snow and ice off my windshield.  When i went on my lunch break that day, i noticed that the one on the passenger's side was loose (just the actual blade, not the whole thing) so i think that can just pop back in.  But the one on the right will start about an inch, and then not go anywhere.        I read online that i may have busted the motor, or a bolt might just be loose.  I can't see anything wrong, but i have no idea what to look at :(      anyone know anything about this???

Hi,      I own a 2007 ford mustang V-6 and lately I've been experiencing a sound coming from the rear. While I'm driving, regardless of speed and while off the accelerator, I hear a thumping/ rumbling noise coming from the rear drivers side tire area.Almost like someone doing a drum roll on bongos. This occurs while coasting and coasting around curves that veer to the right. I've rotated the tires, changed the rear break pads and rotors but it's still there. I also noticed that while driving straight, if I were to slightly jerk the wheel to the left and immediately return to the straight position, the sound appears when the steering wheel is jerked slightly. This one has got me stumped!      Regards,   Mustangindy

After several tries, the lights inside the car, the radio and everything else came on just fine. But the engine still won't start. Every time I turn the ignition, it makes a faint clicking/static noise. Then I tried to turn on the headlights, and they flicker and a loud clicking noise comes from the engine compartment. Any ideas what's going on? Please help.

20090130185709AAZ3zR6	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Old, broken car. Better to fix or buy a new (or used) replacement?	I have a 2002 Hyundai Elantra with 104k miles on it. It's got a boatload of problems, mostly stemming from a bad brake replacement some people did on it last year. Not only do I have to have the rotors and pads replaced, but it's going to need 1) wheel bearings on back 2 tires; 2) brake cables replaced to parking brake; 3) spark plugs (eventually); 4) A/C belt; 5) Timing belt (eventually); 6) New clutch. This is going to run probably between 3 and 3.5k, maybe a little less depending on how well I can negotiate. Besides these issues, the car is ok and runs well enough. Doesn't have any leaks and is in generally good shape, except the latch on the hatchback part is starting to rust out, which isn't a huge issue. My finances are stretched with student loans and grad school starting and I'm still making payments on this car that I can't easily roll into a new loan. Wondering whether it's a better bet to try and fix this to keep it running for 3 or 4 more years, or if it's a lost cause and I should cut my losses now.

I will label them with numbers to make it easier. And before u guys say its 305 they are crap.... save it please. Its different.... and I told my friend I will be able to smoke his mild 350 he is rebuilding (stock). So its a challange      1. Are there way on checking an engine bock for cracks without taking it to a machine shop?? I have looked over the block completely and don't see any, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.       2.How can I check to see if the the piston rods are in good to reuse??      3. If instead of taking the block to the machine shop to be checked for cracks, and since I don't see any (and I looked closely in bright light) what are the chances I even have them?? And if there is one that you can't see (without magnafluxing) then how bad could it get??      4. I also plan on reusing the pistons. There aren't any scratches on them and they don't even look that old. How can I tell if these are any good??      5. I haven't torn into the block too much yet, but if I find a spun bearing what can I do to fix the problem?? Would I need a new block or just thicker bearings??      Thats all I got for tonight. Im renting a harmonic balincer puller tomorrow so I can dig into the motor more and post more questions lol.

20090130195407AAjRDon	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	On a 1999 Ford Taurus...?	The battery voltage on my grandmothers Taurus has run down. It was fine a while ago (a month) but now the car is not even starting. The battery was charged up with a battery charger because it ran down, the car was not driven in a month. So after that the car started and when the car was started the alternator output was putting out 13 volts. Each day for 3 days after that my grandmother started the car and let it idle for 10min to keep the battery charged because of the recent cold and she is not able to drive it because of her vision at the moment. On the fourth day the car didn't start. Is this because the Alternator is not putting out enough for the battery, because the car is not running long enough, or is the battery going bad.

I just bought and installed a new radio for my avalon ( it's nothing special it's a relatively cheap but pretty nice one, a sony CDX-120 )  Now next i want to put in some decent speakers. I'm a novice when it comes to car audio and car mods in general. So, my question is what should i look for in terms of the specs and what not to find some decent speakers? I'm not exactly looking for the best speakers. I just want them to be noticeably better than the factory speakers so I don't want to spend too much.  Is there any specific brand or type of speaker you would recommend for my car? Also, would you recommend getting a full set of four or would just 2 do? also, how do i know what size speaker will fit in my 98 avalon? Thanks a lot!

Just changed the fuel filter in response, but made no difference.

Tranny fluid is at 'Low', which I will remedy    tomorrow (has been shifting poorly..sometimes shifts properly,    other times I must let off accelerator to allow it to shift). Lots    of condensation coming from tailpipe (weather is mid-50's to    low 60's here). 182K miles total.
