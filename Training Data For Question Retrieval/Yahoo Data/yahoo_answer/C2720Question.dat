Well, before we bought our horses we learned that they barely de-worm them at all, and my horses are fine and have never got worms....so, do you think it'd be okay not to de-worm your horses? i do, I need your opinion though..HELP!

20090307081745AAFesVx	Pets;Dogs	Am I too small to handle a pit bull?	Im only 14, but im just thinking in the long run. Ive always been small because of a bone condition i have, and i will most likely not reach past 5ft. Im 4ft 5in right now though. Anyways, Ive always had a special place in my heart for pit bulls. Ive never had one, but once at a dog adoption at Petsmart, i wanted to take one home. She was the sweetest dog Ive ever seen, and its a shame she wasnt a adopted sooner. I think she finally found a home though. Well, Im not really scared of pit bulls, but on the news when the pit bull killed the little boy... well that caused a problem. As soon as i get an apartment, i want to adopt a dog, and i was hoping for a pit, but would i be to small to handle such an energetic dog? AND i cant have a dog that constantly jumps on me because of my bone condition because they could seriously injure me. What do you guys recommend?       P.S. We have 2 rescued little dogs now. A Lhasa Apso mix and a Westie.
20090307082218AAkwb1X	Pets;Dogs	What is the best way to introduce a puppy to older dogs?	In 2 weeks, we are getting a Newfoundland puppy. We have two older dogs, ages 12 and 4. The oldest dog has obviously been introduced to a puppy before, and after establishing dominance (a few bites on the snout), the two have become the best of friends. However, he is now too old to play with the 4-year-old, and one of the reasons for the puppy is for him to have a playmate. The 4-year-old has always been great when we have introduced new small animals into the house (rats, birds, etc.). He would let the rats run all over him, one of our birds flew  into his mouth and he didn't do anything to her, and one of our birds, who was abused before us and has deformed legs, he lets use him as a taxi service (the dog lies down on the ground, the bird gets on, the dog takes him somewhere else, lies down again, the bird gets off. It's quite cute). He can be very gentle, and we trust him with other animals 100%. However, he does not take well to other dogs save for our oldest. There is a dog from the nearby farm that often gets loose and comes to play with him that he likes, but many times, when dogs pass our yard, his hackles are up, and he is in full fight mode. We've tried socializing him, but although he is very friendly towards people and children and small animals, he doesn't like other dogs as a rule. We expect the puppy to get bit a few times by our two older dogs as they establish dominance, but we don't want our 4-year-old to hurt him. What's a good way to introduce them? I will be home 24-hrs when we first get the puppy, so they will be supervised together at all times.

They have white spot, I did a water change last night before getting medicine today, and I did around a 30-40% water change. The water level went below the filter (It's a juwel inbuilt filter and heater) and it started making a loud wibrating/churning sound. So, i turned it off for a minute. When I put water back in and turned it on, It started making a loud vibrating noise. When I came down this morning the water appeared to be quite cold, and when I put my hand next to the pipe coming out of the filter in the water, it didn't seem to be pushing any water out. The water is now very cloudy and full of debris, and it's still making a loud vibrating noise. I've tried wiggling it about but nothing happens except occasionally it makes a horrible loud screeching noise. It seems to be pushing water out now but i'm not sure. I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in.      HELP ME PLEASE!!

Okay i got my paint horse, Sky, when he was six months old and i have trained him by myself since then, he completely trust me and will even follow me blind folded. When i got him he had never be handled and was a stud. I halter broke him immediately and began petting, grooming him daily. I had him clipped at two and started putting the bit in his mouth and lunging him with a saddle. He is now three and i have been actually riding him for six months. From the beginning i have ridden him bareback because he is such a calm horse. He is trained with the saddle though. i recently started trying to get him to canter in my round pen but he doesn't want to break a trot, when he does begin to canter its only for like two strides. If im on a trail and another horse starts cantering he will canter after them. So i know he can do it, he just doesn't seem to understand what im asking him to do. Yes i give him the proper cues, pick up the inside rain, move the outside leg back and apply pressure while kissing to him.  Any ideas PLZ??

I took him on a walk around the neighborhood, and then I fed him.I followed the owners instructions and gave him 1 scoop of one kind of dry food, and 1 scoop of another kind of dry food. She even said I could add a few tater tots since he was a fussy eater. Then I came back around 9 to let him out to go to the bathroom and noticed he only took but 3 bites of his food. Then I came back this morning to let him out and to feed him, and he didn't eat anymore of his evening food, and he hasn't even touched his water...and every time I give him a treat, he doesn't eat it. I had to hand feed him his kibble this morning! I know he is probably upset that he isn't getting all the attention he wants, but there isn't much I can do.       I give him a bone each day to keep him busy, but he just doesn't seem interested. I would bring him over to my house, but we have a dog, and they are crazy together.      Any suggestions? Sorry that was just rambling, but I want to make sure I gave enough info.

I've noticed this last week that my cats food goes down a lot during the night and when my cat comes down first thing in the morning he's smelling around like there has been another cat in. So last night I set the cat flap so things could come in but could not get out to see if it’s a stray cat coming in during the night. I heard loads of loud noises downstairs during the night and went down to find a stray cat destroying the kitchen in panic, so I let him go. So there has been another cat coming in and eating my cats food.      I just wondered is there anyway I could stop it coming in during the nigh? I've looked at those collars that only let your cat through the cat flap but my cat hates wearing collars.      Thanks!

Take them to vet #1 in college town for minor stuff (ex: my dog had a red bump that started spewing puss) and then take them to vet #2 in college town to board and for general health checks?

She was having problems with her back end about two months ago, so we took her to the vet; they couldn't find anything wrong, but told us to get some low-dose pain killers for her.   We did, and she seemed to get better.   She gets on furniture fine, jumps up on the back of the couch when we come home, and has no problems jumping up on the bed.      But she's been acting very strange now.   We usually just pat the dogs' back ends when we want them to move off the couch, or to a different spot [they love taking out places after we get up for warmth].   We did cut down on that while she was "recovering" from whatever had aggravated her back end.      So now that she's better, we went back to the same routine.   She was fine last week, but this week she's been snipping at us.   We'll tell her to move, she'll just stare at us, so we'll tap her back end to make her move -- then she gets up, growling, and moves away.      She also had a shaking-fit yesterday. It might have been because I was aggravated at my mother, and then my brother was being loud, and she didn't like all of the commotion -- but she growled at anyone who touched her [even my father, the alpha], and shook more when my brother was around her.            We *don't* hit our dogs, so there's absolutely *no* reason for her to snap at us.   They all know that we're of higher rank then them.         We have another appointment for her in a couple of weeks, to check up on her progress, and we plan on bringing this up.   But do any of you have any idea on what might be wrong? Or what we can do to "help her through this stage", until we find out what's bothering her back end?      Thanks.
20090307071759AAxSQ7m	Pets;Dogs	How to treat my puppy's lyme disease?	Two weeks ago, our 6 month old golden retriever went to a boarding type training camp, where he stayed at this place, and got trained. They training worked great, but this morning, we found two ticks on him, one by his muzzle, and one near his front left leg and neck. There is a skin rash at both the places, and we are sure he has lyme disease. Although, the vet saw this, and said that he doesn't need to take any prescriptions unless we see the stage two signs, like refusing to eat and weakness. We argue that its better to treat him now, so that it doesn't worsen. My mom is a doctor, and she thinks that we can give him tetracyline (for humans) and treat him with that. Is that okay, or will it hurt our dog?

20090307072653AALcVhO	Pets;Dogs	Our 6 month old BT has just started peeing when she gets excited or scolded?	Our 6 month old Boston Terrier has started to pee when we have a visitor walk into our home, when my husband or I come home from work or the store or when she is told, "No" or to "Get down".  So, mainly when she is super excited or upset.        We do NOT yell at our puppy, but we are firm when she tries to jump onto our faces or onto our beds.  We tell her "No" and remove her from the bed or from where she doesn't need to be but, as we remove her, she is already peeing.       Is this a phase or something we need to look into?  Other than these recent incidents, she has been fully housebroken since she was 4 months old.       She is very loved and well-cared for.....has plenty of chew toys and even has a playmate (our other dog).  She is going to be spayed on Monday, but is this a problem I should discuss with my vet?  Seems like she has a weakened bladder now....

20090307072953AATS7a3	Pets;Dogs	Goldens have the CCA.  What does your breed have?	The CCA is the Certificate of Conformation Assessment and is run by the Golden Retriever Club of America.  If you are not familiar with the program there is a wealth of information here:    http://www.grca.org/events/cca/index.htm...       In short, it's an opportunity to have people knowledgeable in the breed standard evaluate your dog.  Two of the three evaluators at any event must be actual AKC judges.  I have had the opportunity to attend two of these events, once when I entered my dog and once as a volunteer steward.  It was one of the most highly educational experiences I've had concerning aspects of conformation.        So I wonder, do other breed clubs have similar programs?

Will the other 2 fish ever let him alone?       I have another 3ft tank with 3 goldfish in there - it has a filter and a heater and i am planning on swapping the goldfish with the oscars and the other fish! Will this be a good idea or not because goldfish produce a lot of ammonia and im scared the water quality will not be good enough! Should i get my water tested or risk it? Do you think that if the oscars are moved to a bigger tank will the 1 oscar still be bullied?

Now I'm wondering if I have to dump all that good drinking water or can the fish use it?  I know the drops I use for his water when I use tap takes out the chlorine and the 9.5 ph drinking water has no chlorine, but are there other factors I need to consider for the fish's water?  He's hanging out in a 1.5 gallon tank right now waiting for his new home.  Can I use that water he's in now and dump it in the 10 gallon to regulate?  He's also been floating around on his back and side with a bloated tummy for a few weeks and I just didn't feed him for two days (I read to fast him) and he seemed better, so I fed him just a little pinch yesterday morning and now he's floating again.  I'm also wondering if I should change his food?  He's eating the goldfish flakes from the pet area at Wal-Mart.  I'm reading to feed him peas, but when I try to do that, they sink to the bottom and he can't get at them because he's so buoyant.  I guess I have two questions in one here, so any help here would be appreciated.  Thanks!

20090307073203AA9lSsc	Pets;Dogs	6 month old puppy passed away. What do I do?	Yesterday my brother and his gf's almost 6 month old pit bull/boxer puppy passed away. They live with us so it was like my little puppy too. My brother's gf and I woke up normally around 9am and let her out of her crate and she just seemed so off. She is normally very excited to see people, but instead she was just very mellow and kept lying down. We took her out to do her business and she did both then came in and didn't even want to drink, she just lied down. She normally devours her water bowl. We gave her the vitamins she always takes, but she spit it out so I fed it to her in my hand and she eventually ate it. We tried giving her food which she usually drools over, but she wouldn't eat it. I for sure thought she had eaten something the night before and had a bad stomach cramp that was going to pass later that night. I was wrong. It got worse throughout the day to the point where she was breathing heavily and could barely walk. I left for work around 2pm and my brother's gf took her to the vet. On the way there it seemed as if she had stopped breathing. They put her on life support for a couple hours and just decided to late nature take it's toll. According to the vet, she ate something poisonous the night before when my brother and his gf put her out in the backyard with a new extended leash that went out pretty far. We have a lake in our backyard so there are a lot of geese. The vet for sure thinks she ate geese droppings which are very harmful and toxic. She did like her share of crap to say the least haha. Anyway, the day before I took her out for a long walk and ran around with her and she seemed fine. It seems as if the poison worked over night. I miss her so much I can't stop crying and I haven't eaten since I found out she passed when I came home from work around 7pm. We buried her in our backyard this morning and my mom, who is not an animal lover at all, was in tears! Hailey, the puppy, was such a sweet, loving, obedient dog just like her mother. I don't know what to do with myself along with my brother, his gf, and my mother. At least I know she's with my Dad in heaven since he was a dog lover and you could not help but to fall in love with hailey. Today is her 6 month birthday too, it's so hard!

20090227135408AAD84nE	Pets;Horses	Conditioning leather boots with hand lotion?	I've been doing this for years, and it somehow never occurred to me that it might harm the boots! I tend to scrub my boots after a muddy day, and  afterwards I'll put a little dab of lotion on them to soften the leather (which tends to get hard from the cold rain here!). I have only ever done this to my cheap leather jodphur boots, and when possible (if I'm at the barn xD) I give them a good run-over with saddle soap. I ALWAYS rinse anything leather off with water -or at least wet it down - and dry it before putting it away.      I was wandering if this could harm my boots in any way. They're Dublin Advance Boots  - fairly new, as my old ones recently went to a younger rider in need of cheap boots with some wear on them.
20090227134527AARN5mU	Pets;Dogs	I just wanted to say...  I love my dog!?	When we got our puppy i was determined to love him but not be in love with him.  I know its so childish to think that way.  I didnt want to be hurt if he got sick like our last dog that we had to put down.  I wanted to keep myself from him and still love him.  Man that didnt take very long to change.  When he spent the night at the vet for his neuter I was so lost.  My whole day and night had to change for this fuzz ball.  I know that if he ever went away it would crush me.  It would destroy my kids.  My cats would be happy. (demon dog likes to play, only when they jump on him)  I would be lost with out him.  He just wormed his way right into my heart.  How many of you have stories that make you feel this kind of love?  Lets hear 'em!

20090227134930AApRqWE	Pets;Fish	Test strip kit not reading nitrite?	My tank is cycling right now and I've been testing it everyday to make sure everything is normal. I've had it all set up with a filter, air pump, and gravel for almost 2 weeks now. I know about the whole cycling process and how it changes from Ammonia, to Nitrites, and then Nitrates and what levels they all should be on. But it's been about two weeks and the test strip still doesn't show any signs of Nitrite. It's still on the Ammonia level. How long does it take for the cycle to go through each step and finish?    Once when I had to change the water (NOT completely!) I had to add more water than usual because the tank wasn't filled up enough. Could that have made the cycle start over?

Well, I realized while we were getting ready to put in the live rocks, I saw 2-3 red, little bristleworms, .7" roughly. Well, I tried to poke them with a toothpick, it didn't work so great, and I decided I'd get rid of em later. Then I never saw em again. It's been two weeks since I had that toothpick incident. And now I was looking at the tank, and there it was, a bristleworm! Well, it's roughly 1.5" now and guess what? It turned from red to a pale white! What happened? I know exactly where it lives, how do I kill it! I took a pair of pliers, and tried to get it, but just like the toothpick, it didn't work. I'm determined to trap it before it gets any larger! Also, it's pale white, does that mean it's sick? Or do they always change color? Also, help me with a homemade trap, I really need one! Please respond ASAP for the sake of my tank! Thank you!

And suprisingly he has the body of a labrador but smaller. He doesn't have a tail like a beagle. Beagles have a shorter tail that's rounded at the top. My dog has a big tail like a labrador.

20090307090159AA3mFcb	Pets;Cats	My cat died last night from poisoning, does any one know of an emergency treatment that can be administered?	I am asking on behalf of a friend who lives out in the country hours away from an emergency vet.   When I told him about Sookie he was concerned as to what he would do in that situation.   Apparently rat poison caused the animal to bleed out from the inside, eventually (many hours, possibly days depending on the size and health of the animal) the lungs fill up with blood and the animal dies.  Please discourage everyone you know not to use poison to kill pests - what a hideous way to die! Treatment is oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vitamin K shots to restore blood clotting. This treatment can cost upward of $500-1,200 with no guarantee of survival.  My cat was happy and playing the evening before, when I found her she was listless, with dilated eyes, weak meow, pale gums nose and ears (sign of anemia or internal bleeding) with dried blood on her anus (sign of internal bleeding), many of you posted comments to go to the vet immediately and all of you were correct, thank you all for your responses.

Some people don't care that people post such idiotic questions, some are apathetic and others, like me, have strong opinions and are brave enough to express them.       I just want to know what is it that people seem to have against my opinions? Whenever I reply saying "You should not have a dog if you can't afford it" or b*tch about BYBs, I get numerous thumbs down and sometimes replies telling me I'm being rude. Well at least I'm not selfish, that's all I can say.      Opinions on this matter will be appreciated.
20090307094642AAR2SO9	Pets;Dogs	Will my dog stop bleeding when I spay her?	My dog showed no signs of being in heat such as swelling of the nipples, swelling of the vulva, and moodiness. We also live with an intact male who hasn't shown the "I gotta get her!" that everyone on YA told me he would. Also two of our neighbors have intact males and I haven't seen them or anything. So YA told me she was not in heat and what do you know yesterday I was surprised with bleeding. It's too bad it couldn't wait until after Wednesday which is her spay appointment day. Am I stuck with this heat or will the bleeding stop following the surgery?
20090307091336AAK2ge6	Pets;Cats	How to make my cat more comfortable when driving?	Next month, my family and I would be going on vacation to the Carribean and we have a 3-year-old Bengal cat. We decided that we will leave our cat by my Aunt, who lives an hour and a half way in an condominium.    My cat isn't really comfortable during drives, and he starts to panic by meowing, shedding tons of fur and squriming a lot.    How could I make him more comfortable? Do you think that taking him for a few short drives to get him accustom to driving help? And how could I ensure that he is safe (like putting him in a cat cage or keeping him on my lap)?

And they dont like watermelons. And this morning we went outside and my dogs food was missing. It broke into teh box and flipped it and ate the remaining food that there was.

I can do it some of the day, and then the next but the cat won't be staying at my house. It will go back to it's house (neighbors cat, they said it was okay).      The dog hates cats, and if I'm not there she will chase it. Not only chase it, but attack it.      I want to prove to my parents that with a little time and patience two animals can get along. Even a dog that HATES cats, and a cat that is  scared of dogs.      ONLY HELPFUL ANSWERS, IF IT WON'T WORK THEN I WILL SEE THAT FROM THE HELPFUL ANSWERS.      Thank you! SO much! (I will also be documenting it, so I can show my parents and get some extra credit.) I will not be risking the cats life if I know this won;t work out. I'm not stupid.

20090307100533AAgLmQN	Pets;Horses	Cross country safety? (discussion, opinions)?	I read an article in a horse magazine about how there is very controversial issues about the safety of cross country. As you may know, cross country fences are solid, so if the rider makes a mistake it may have extreme consequences.    Some want to change cross country to make the fences non-solid, so if the rider makes a mistake the jump will break. Some want to keep it the traditional solid style, because it is tradition, and they say that the people that do have an accident didnt practice enough, and were just rushing the course.    I personally think that the jumps should be made non-solid, because many have even died because of the accidents, and even the best riders out there can still make a mistake and get hurt.      here are some articles:    http://www.hsus.org/horses_equines/event...     http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...     http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/sports...

20090307090919AA8zhOr	Pets;Dogs	Is my Akita suffering from epilepsy?	About once or twice a year, my Akita goes through these weird spasms...His hind legs become flaccid, and he cannot move them. He starts to panic and will come to me by dragging his hind legs. He starts breathing heavily, and I can really see an expression of fear on his face. At that point, he doesn't want me to leave him, and panics more if I try to leave for help. Sometimes he shakes uncontrollably. I don't know how to really describe it, but I have been to vet's and they say that they can not find out what it is unless they see or test him while he is having the spasms. It's very unpredictable and I don't know what triggers it.  He's had blood work done and it was normal. I feel that people are reluctant to help me because of his breed and size... I have even been refused treatment by a vet because he is an Akita. I just want to know if ANYONE has experienced something like this, or if anyone knows what I can do to help my dog. It's really sad and it's so scary when it happens. The last time he had these spasms, I gave him a huge piece of raw salmon and about 2 minutes later he jumped out and ran around the house. Any idea why the salmon helped?

And her nipples useto be small circles and now they're pinkish red and small triangles. But they got a tiny bit bigger. It's been like 3 weeks now. And i'm taking her to the vet.

20090307094744AAPqbwd	Pets;Birds	If you have an African grey Parrot I nede your help!?	Ive always wanted a congo and to my suprise I got ahold of a 6 yr old female very recently. She appears to b healthy but I can tell her previous owners neglected her. When They dropped her off at my house they spent less than 2 minutes. The woman was on her cell phone the entire time and said only a few words. She had previously told me that she was having financial diffulculties and she happily took the 500$.... cage included! The birds cage was caked with crap and dust. My friend who is a supervisor at a zoo  who has had monkeys, tigers, etc told me that it was disgiusting. When we tried to get her out in order to clean out her cage we had to wear monkey proof gloves to get ahold of her. She is so afraid and freaks out when you get your fingers near her. After spending an hour cleaning out her cage we put on the monkey gloves to put her in the cage. She again freaked out biting and shreiking. It does seem that she is getting better. She'll take grapes out of my hands and lets me scratch her neack, but she is like scared of hands! How can I regain her trust and train her without getting bitten. She is smart and says soo much stuff and uses great pronunciation... I think she was neglected and not tooken out of her cage much..... what do I do?      Any advice on training... I understand the health part and spoil her with toys and stuff.... she has a great diet, but my book on Greys doesen't explain how to gain her trust!

20090307090702AAJVR8Z	Pets;Dogs	What is the best way to house train my puppy?	We got a new puppy. and we have been trying to train him. We did the whole let him have the run of the house but if we caught him...we startle him, tell him no...and take him outside. but that really wasn't working. then we did the kennel training and i just didn't think that was a good way to train him by keeping him in there all day then letting him out only to go outside. Now i am trying the whole puppy pad,,,keeping him in one area then lead the puppy pads out the door. I know its not good to keep changing training, but with my 9 month old son.its hard to give this dog all the attention he needs. What is the best why to train him cause its hard to train him when my son needs all my attention

As the title says my dog, an 8 year old english springer spaniel, has a lump on her spleen and we were also told she is auto immune. The day before being told this a vet said "It's just an infection". How wrong he was!!!    We were told that if she responds to steroids and her blood count increases she will be ok to have the op to remove her spleen. This is all a little optimistic. The lump which may be cancerous may have spread to the liver but they won't be able to tell until she has the op to remove her spleen.   Is there any chance that she will pull through? I hope so, she's too young to go! Just any advice or other information at all really would be really appreciated.

I have three dogs ( well they are all family dogs because i am 13) one is mine and they other two are my dads and grandmas. My dog hubble is about 4 years and she has a sister named smokey who is also 4. My other dog who is much bigger then them is sen-chi. Anyway smokey attacked hubble and there was an horrible fight in which both of the dog had to be separated by animal control and taken to the vet. Hubble had more damage then smokey but they both got hurt pretty badly. Now they are all separated from each other (including sen-chi) and have to be kept in kennels most of the day. Now i am very worried that my dog Hubble will never be able to be around other dogs again. Hubble is a Black Lab mix and weighs about 48 pounds. She has always been overly playful with other dogs. She has been to the dog park many times as well as being around other dogs. She was fine with all of the other dogs ( except her over playfulness, extreme sniffing,running around a lot taking other dogs toys sometimes etc..)

I want to know something that i could do now to help her and also what an animal behaviorist might tell me. Please help me i don't know what to do.

My new neighbors across the street let their unspayed females out every day and it's been attracting a lot of feral cats to our street.  I've had far too many near accidents with a stray cat or my neighbor's cat on the road.  The feral cats are disgusting and are known to have fleas, ticks, and internal parasites.  They poop everywhere on my yard so I'm afraid my yard might is becoming contaminated with worms. My dogs hate the cats, because they lounge on my front porch and the males "spray" on our yard.  The cats scream and meow all night and get into the trash all the time.      I've already talked to my neighbors about their cats, but they won't change their minds about it and believe cats should be allowed to roam.  There is no form of animal control where I live.  Is there any way I can get rid of all these feral cats without hurting them or without the help of my neighbor who has caused all this trouble?

I then gave him dry food on a plate which he did eat, not much, but he still ate. I then started patting him again which he did not respond too very much. I then picked up his tail, he hissed ( to nothing, didnt look at me, just hissed looking to a wall) and ran out of the room. He is now sitting in a closet, not sleeping, not looking around, just sitting there. I love this cat and i dont know what i can do without him. Please tell me what i should do!
