Any item over this amount you should pay for Recorded delivery or similar so you can claim the full amount back.|`|OCgZACJqaa	My husband is a big E-bay seller, he always gets a proof of posting and a receipt for the postage stamps for normal items such as photographs.  BUT when he sells items like records that can be worth quite a bit of money he always sends them 'to be signed for' about 4.50 p&p it may be more now, and that covers him for quite a lot of insurance if the item gets lost.  He always makes sure he keeps the receipt in case of problems.    The problem is did you send it 'Large Letter' because if you sent them in a normal envelope, then it would not go through the little slot in the posting guide the post office has.  But a large letter would cost more than a first class stamp.  When did you send them because if there was not enough postage on them the person who receives them would have to pay a charge before the post office would let them have it.    I don't think the Post Office will pay out if you have no proof of posting.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	As long as you registered them you just need to go to the post office with the slip and they will either find them or reimburse you up to the value you stated on the registration.

I hope you still keep the email thread you have communicate with him regarding the translator, if he refuse to refund, you can file a dispute to ebay.      Regarding feedback, he cannot change his feedback he already left for you.  I suggest you should try to resolve the issue with the seller before leaving him a negative feedback, maybe it is just a mistake and if he is willing to refund to you, you should cut him a slack without leaving him a negative (it really hurt a seller's rating).|`|glynFK9haa	If things don't happen the way you want or the person doesn't go along with you, try suing.|`|gHIEbYM9aa	That is horrible!

7u77AiBjaa	If you mean that you want to use a 360 image as your picture on Yahoo! Answers:    Create a 360 space at http://360.yahoo.com . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.    Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.    - Click your "My Page" link at the top  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).    You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... .    Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.    NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (http://avatars.yahoo.com ) and forget about using the 360 image.    OTHER TIPS:   *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though.   *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe... . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

There you find alot of fun questions and you wont get called a troll (you DONT want to be a troll) just because you posted questions in the wrong section.     Also, that way you wont get violated/suspended for placing in the wrong category.

In the meantime, you can (1) receive notification when a person adds you as a contact and review them at that time, and (2) just block them temporarily and then UNBLOCK them. Most folks, once blocked, don't bother to add you as a contact a second time. If they do, and you really don't want them as a fan, you can then permanently block them. That's how I handle mine, anyway.

You would also need a best answer percentage of about 10-15% in that section(not overall which is shown on your profile page).    The badge is based on your recent activity, so if you answer there and get a good amount of best answers, you could become a top cotributor. If you do get a badge, you can lose it if your activity drops, so you'll have to keep answering there.    Taking a look at your profile, most of your answers have come within the last week, so look for getting a badge in about two weeks at the soonest(they are awarded on mondays).

You started out with 100.      All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.

84441c4476dc5550adedd8b3634f6bdcaa	Since 5 days ... my avatar picture on my yahoo 360 wasn't working as well ... BUT it works NOW <br>  <br>  All you gota do is to JUST wait till the system catches up ... and your picture will show up right away|`|7u77AiBjaa	Patience is necessary if you use the 360 image feature. A LOT of people have posted about this issue in this category of Yahoo! Answers.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if your image is showing on your Yahoo! Answers profile settings area or not. OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. In the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just make sure the image is uploaded in the 360 personal profile picture module, chosen as primary, and that 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile has been chosen. Let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment to the 360 image. If you don't want to wait, continue using the Yahoo! Avatar and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. You are not guaranteed a written staff response though. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff. More "missing" images have been appearing over the last couple of days.<br>  <br>  Contacting Yahoo! 360 about the issue will not help you, as they stopped dealing with bugs related to 360 in October 2007. Yahoo! 360 is in the process of migrating to the Yahoo! Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ).
AZvD8pnAaa	NO! because I DON'T get all my answers from here. And if people do, that means they just are to lazy to use the brains God gave them. Wake up people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1180f4c62ca893325b92497a755c82d5aa	"Do you know your parents know your getting answers from here?"<br>  That is the question for you to answer. We all have the knowledge to think out the answer, though some try to think out the answer then write it, thinking it's wrong so they come over here to gain answers. <br>  <br>  If you can't think an answer for any class, refer to your teachers for help, don't just sit quietly and think that you can do all of these with your knowledge in the subject you are in. Who knows, the school districts might be looking on this site under Homework Help, to see that some of the people need more help under a certain subject.<br>  <br>  It is not your fault that you don't know the answer, getting an answer by here is most likely cheating, one reason for it because you are telling the person your question which they have to give the answer. Let's say your in College, you need help, though your afraid to ask your professors/teachers for help, and you refer to here for answers. That does not help you become what you want to be, that just shows you have no knowledge at all.<br>  <br>  All I am saying is, your parents always know your getting answers here either they look in your browser history tabs or in the address panel.|`|Y6fUbS9Uaa	Hahahaha. They may even be answerers here with an alias you don't know, replying to your assignment questions. Funny if that is the case.|`|2lakZBgiaa	no? well unless they know your yahoo answers ID and they also have a profile, other than that they don't have a chance. and who gets their homework answers from yahoo answers?!?|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Well that explains all the d minuses on the report cards.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	I don't get my answers here. I do it myself. Some people are just lazies.
zDQIPFH2aa	YA has always rounded down on those numbers.  They have promised to fix it "one day".  That was three years ago.<br>  <br>  So 8.2% and 91.8% are 8% and 91%.|`|aNhvckHEaa	Because nobody is perfect :)|`|rY84Ap6Maa	lol, normal. go to another page and come back. its fixed.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes that is how they are i thought about it it might be because it is like 10. some thing and then they add up but they only write it as 10 so it wont add up?
MGLHWUsgaa	Your question can be answered in an Episode of Seinfeld. Jerry says that 90% of the population is ugly. Which is true, take a look at people walking by you at the mall. How many of them do you think are attractive?<br>  <br>  If we apply this logic to intelligence, if 90% of the population is ugly, then shouldn't 90% of the population be stupid?  If so, you now know the reason for idiotic questions--- people are idiots.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	because they like to start rises or have people do there homework for them.|`|4d8O0Rtqaa	When you ask a question like that, you might want to proof read the question first.|`|stHYBDfAaa	why do people not knowhow to spell asK on yahoo answers?|`|AA11659120	because like yourself they cant spell ASK|`|SOxdyWQOaa	got me but it's fun to answer them.|`|sCehoTIsaa	Because they are idiotic kids who think this site is a toy that completes their homework for them as they are lazy.

Then you can "rate" answers with "thumbs up" and "thumbs down." Just click on the “thumbs up” icon to give someone a “thumbs up” and show you approve of or like their answer; same but reverse meaning  with “thumbs down,” click on the icon to show you disapprove or don’t like the answer.. It doesn’t cost you any points to “rate” an answer but, once you do rate, you’re stuck with that rating. You can’t later change your mind and decide they don’t deserve the “thumbs up” or have regrets about giving a “thumbs down.” They’re forever.<br>  <br>  Stars are ways to show approval for questions. You click on the star icon to give a star, click on the same place to remove your star after you give it. No points involved..<br>   <br>  Answer a question and get 2 pts. Ask a question and lose 5 pts. Choose the "best answer" to your question and get 3 of those 5 pts. back.  Be chosen as "best answer" and get 10 pts. plus 1 bonus pt. for each "thumbs up" your answer received. There’s no deduction for “thumbs down.”<br>  <br>  You LOSE 5 points for every question that you ask.  However, after 4  hours then blue buttons will be visible to you under each answer your question received and you click the button under the answer you like best then you get 3 points back. Anyone, even people on level 1, can "vote" but it's not the same as "rating" with thumbs up/down.<br>  <br>  Vote for "best answer" on unresolved questions “in voting” and you get 1 pt. per question.  You can vote by clicking on the “answer” toolbar at the top of the page then click on the “vote” tab or, when you see the list of questions available in a particular category, there’s a “vote” tab at the top of the questions. Either way, if you vote then you earn a point per question and help pick the “best answer.”  Anyone, even people on level 1, can vote on unresolved questions.<br>  <br>  You also get 1 pt. every day for just logging in. It’s as easy as that!<br>  <br>  IF YOUR PROFILE SAYS YOU NEED "X" POINTS TO REACH THE NEXT LEVEL, IT MEANS YOU NEED "X" MORE POINTS THAN WHAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, you'll be on level 2 in no time and then aim for level 3 (1,000 to 2,499 pts.)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	By getting at least 250 points by answering or voting on questions and receiving best answer.|`|AkPkrTf1aa	It's really easy just get 250 points.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	250 points will get to your next level

k6u1Kka0aa	The moderators do not follow any set rules. I have had an answer deleted for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I have reported others for being insulting toward others and nothing happens. Go figure.|`|iMy46j9laa	Yes I have had a question and a few answers deleted and I know they were not against the guide linews.   If someone does not like your question/answer all they have to do is report it.   Good questions/answers get deleted all the time on here. The trolls are really bad about reporting good questions/answers to get them deleted. All it takes is 2 reports to get a question/answer deleted. Chatting is the number one reason for questions to be deleted.

But I am following the suggestion of other answers here to read the guidelines.|`|SvsDQ0poaa	Sometimes trolls who have nothing better to do simply report answers for no good reasons at all.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Read the community guidelines and learn what is acceptable and what is not.  There are many reasons other than being rude.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	You need to wait 4 hours before you can vote for best answer. a blue button will show under each answer. Choose your best answer and click the blue button under it. You then can rate with 1-5 stars and leave a comment. You will get 3 points for voting. You have up to four days to vote before it goes to a community vote.<br>  <br>  If its an other members question that you want to vote on you need wait for 4 days or more then go back  to the question and vote you will get 1 point for voting.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	You need to wait at least 4 hours.|`|nErAWfHxaa	If you ask questions, you have to wait for four (4) hours after asking the question in order to choose the "best answer." That's to give folks a fair chance to log in and find your question. Many of us log on and off periodically during the day and we may not be online when you posted.<br>  <br>  Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."<br>  <br>  Once you're at your profile, look under your avatar (photo) and you'll see a list of all the questions you've answered plus a tab you can click to see the questions where you were chosen as "best answer," the questions you've asked and the questions you've starred.<br>  <br>  Click on the word questions and you'll see the list of your questions, click the question and it shows you not only the question but all the answers. There will be a blue box under each answer. Click the box of the answer you liked best. You will get 3 points for choosing.<br>  <br>  Be sure you pick the "best answer" before the time for answering expires or it'll be too late, it'll go into voting. <br>  <br>  IF YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION, to vote on unresolved questions click the "answer" toolbar at the top of the page then click on the "vote" tab and it'll show you a bunch of questions in voting.

Click the blue points next to your avatar and it will take you to the level page where you can see what you can do each day for each level. Asking is -5 points, answering a question is +2 points, voting for an answer is 1 point, if you choose someone as best answer to your question you get 3 points back. If your answer is chosen as best answer you will get 10 points. Plus 1 point for each thumbs up, but only if you are chosen best answer, that is up to 50.

2Hl4AAP7aa	are you asking a question about a car if so post it in  the car category and be sure it is a question not  a statement, this is not really a question because it is unclear what you want to know about the car.. the best way to respond to a question is to provide an answer that is what you know about the question asked, if you don't know move on to the next one. you must attempt to answer the question.
B7DcLYPyaa	Legally, once you turn 18 you can make decisions for yourself. <br>  <br>  We can't tell from your question why your mom would say that. Is she having a hard time emotionally letting "her baby" grow up?  Or does she have a good reason for thinking you are not the college-type?  Because whatever you finally decide for yourself, (and you ought to be responsible for your own life,) it will have long-lasting consequences in your relationship with your mom.<br>  <br>  Listen to her advice, but make your own decision. It is your life, not hers.  All you owe her is respect, you don't owe her your future. <br>  <br>   Do you have a high school guidance counselor? He/She would be in a better position to know what the real situation is and give some practical advice. If you really want to go to college and you need $$ but your mom won't pay, then you can talk to a navy recruiter. The navy has a higher rate of helping with college than the army. Or try the National Guard.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Of course you can do it on your own.  Talk to your guidance counselor and school.

C6jFigESaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  There isn't a specific number set to determine account suspension for violating the Community Guidelines and/or Terms Service . While members may get away with up to 60 violation notices for minor offense such as chatting ( note some do get suspended for less), one extreme offense of the TOS ( Terms of Service) may result the suspension or Termination of their account, even without prior notice.<br>  <br>  If you are often found in violation, then it is reasonable to anticipate a suspension relatively soon, as frequently violating the CG ( Community Guidelines) shows that you are not adjusting to Guidelines standards. <br>  <br>  Once again, it may take several violation notices ( like chatting) to have your account suspended, while a single, extreme offense ( i.e., if you use a pornographic Avatar as your display) you may be terminated without prior notice. <br>  <br>  If you are not sure whether your content violates the CG and TOS, you should revise the CG and TOS once more to improve your understanding of Answers Code of Conduct. You can also learn more about the site via the HELP link upper right corner of every page. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|SvsDQ0poaa	Unfortunately no one really seems to know what that magic formula that Yahoo uses to figure it out is.  Basically they take into consideration your level (points), the severity of the offense, e.g. adult material is regarded as worse than, say, chattting.  Then everytime your question gets reported and deleted (i.e. at least 2 people have reported you), then you should get an email about it.  Just keep a tally of the and that should do it.  It's also matters how many violations you get per given time frame (frequency of violations).

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	They are not 'repeating' them in the way you think. Here is what is REALLY happening. It is all due to queueing and caching.<br>  <br>  You go to a page to review questions. As you are reading, questions are posting -- only they really are not. They are being queued up and held because the page is NOT refreshing automatically. So they wait and wait. Now, you hit the bottom of the page, click for the next page -- and WHOOSH -- ALL the pages refresh, all the waiting questions post at ONE time. They post at the top of the prior page, pushing the OLD questions off the bottom of that page -- and onto the TOP of the page you are now on. So, you think they are repeats. But really they are just in a NEW position.<br>  <br>  To PREVENT this -- to a certain degree -- try manually refreshing the page you are on once in a while (click F5), so the new questions post more frequently.
