My grandparents are getting that little bit older now and are finding it a bit of a struggle to manage the upkeep of their gardens. My dad has said that they should have gravel/stones laid and then just have a centre plant pot or tree with some flowers around the boundary and he's offered to help them arrange it all... the thing is that my grandparents are on a pension and are worried about the cost, can it be done cheaply?

Here's the situation...My fridge (not freezer) was running just fine at one point, and now its getting warmer and warmer. I was told to let it defrost b/c sometimes ice builds up and the passageway from the freezer to fridge gets blocked.      So I defrosted the fridge TWICE, the 2nd time I did I let it defrost for 72 hours. Both times there was a huge puddle at the bottom.      I'd like to know what part might need to get replaced that isn't allowing the fridge to stay cool or that lets so much blockage build up.      PLEASE only people who know what they're talking about reply.      Thank You.
20090227121813AAXG6rU	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Gardeners have you used the "hanging tomato bag?"?	I purchased 2 tomato hanging bags to use on my patio. How well do they work? Any problems you may have encountered or suggestions to make my experience easier?      Also, I want to plant by seed this year so that I can rotate my plants. Last year all my veggies were ripe at the same time and I had an abundance of veggies that rotted on the vine.       1.How many weeks apart do you think I should start them and also,   2. when should I get started. I live in the Sacramento Valley and temps at night are currently fluctuating a lot. Anywhere from 34 degrees to 50.   3. any soil suggestions? Last year I used Miracle grown and some manure.       4. I was told not to over fertilize as it can hinder tomatos but considering I am also planting cucumbers, zuchini, bell peppers and sugar peas in the same plot, that confuses me. What do you think I should feed my veggies?      Last year, I container gardened so everything was in seperate- that is why I am curious about feeding.

Kenmore Black Microwave, Model No. 565.8978090 I was cleaning it today because it was real dirty, and I noticed the light starting to dim, then eventaully it just went out.   I noticed over the past few weeks it would go out sometimes, but if you open and slam the door a few times it would come back on, but it didn't this time....and I didn't want to keep slamming or hitting on it so I left it alone. I tried to unscrew where I thought the bulb went, it was a circular cover being held by one screw, undid it and found this really odd pipe with a holder, didnt know what on earth it was so screwed it back shut....      If I can't replace the bulb without the price of buying a new microwave, this is my real question..      Can a microwave still heat things up without the bulb on the inside?    Seems like a stupid question but I think I remember reading something about this.
