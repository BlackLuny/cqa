Vzzc6mATaa	Raoul Wallenberg The man who saved the jews he  saved 100,000 lives in world war two you can read a lot about him   one the bravest and most wonderful men ever <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ei=UM2eSdTgPOKHjAeG_MXgCw&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&q=RAOUL+WALLENBERG&spell=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ei=...</a><br>  Why not draw him and show some peopal he saved ?<br>  <br>  Sandor Ardai, one of the drivers working for Wallenberg<br>  <br>  "... he climbed up on the roof of the train and began handing in protective passes through the doors which were not yet sealed. He ignored orders from the Germans for him to get down, then the Arrow Cross men began shooting and shouting at him to go away. He ignored them and calmly continued handing out passports to the hands that were reaching out for them. I believe the Arrow Cross men deliberately aimed over his head, as not one shot hit him, which would have been impossible otherwise. I think this is what they did because they were so impressed by his courage. After Wallenberg had handed over the last of the passports he ordered all those who had one to leave the train and walk to the caravan of cars parked nearby, all marked in Swedish colours. I don't remember exactly how many, but he saved dozens off that train, and the Germans and Arrow Cross were so dumbfounded they let him get away with it "<br>  "|`|qzXpmNHeaa	you can draw.... saving someone lol|`|kM41OvF4aa	a king of hearts...an ace of spades...someone saving someone else from a fire...draw a marine in the midst of combat...i really think you should draw a rich politician who wants the economy to improve take a pay cut now that would be brave...draw a rich ceo of one of these vehicle manufacturers taking a pay cut to save the company to help his company, and draw tax payers in the back ground cheering him on because atleast he's trying to help his own ****** company and not making we tax payers pay the ****** bill...i guess it would be a kind of fictional painting, to think that these muther ******* would take a little initiative and do the right thing instead of looking for that easy buck...i make 20,000,000 but i'ma try to milk these ppl for atleast 5 more, i got a little off subject, but this question made me start thinkin|`|myBoF6Dvaa	Lion.

In WWII conservation was accomplished mainly by rationing, and victory gardens. <br>  <br>   Fuel oil and gasoline, tires were rationed, typewriters that were non-essential were asked to be turned over to the armed forces, cloth–specifically silk and nylon which were used for military purposes–was severely limited. Food was rationed and  limited: particularly meat, sugar, butter, coffee and many other items were rationed.<br>  <br>  Here’s a list of thing that were rationed<br>  Tires  January 1942 to December 1945<br>  Cars February 1942 to October 1945<br>  Bicycles July 1942 to September 1945<br>  Gasoline May 1942 to August 1945<br>  Fuel Oil & Kerosene October 1942 to August 1945<br>  Solid Fuels (ie coal) September 1943 to August 1945<br>  Stoves December 1942 to August 1945 <br>  Rubber Footwear October 1942 to September 1945<br>  Shoes February 1943 to October 1945 <br>  Sugar May 1942 to 1947<br>  Coffee November 1942 to July 1943<br>  Processed Foods March 1943 to August 1945<br>  Meats, canned fish March 1943 to November 1945<br>  Cheese, canned milk, fats March 1943 to November 1945 <br>  Typewriters March 1942 to April 1944<br>  <br>  Also people were encouraged to “put-up” their car for the duration. You saved old cooking fat and turned it in. You could own no more than five tires, if you had a critical need for them, Doctors for example could have five tires, most people only got four, and even then you had to tires inspected before you got a gas ration card.  If you had a “A” sticker on your car you could buy no more than 4 gallons of fuel per week and for almost a year a “A” stickered car could not be driven for pleasure. There was also a national maximum “Victory Speed” was 35 miles an hour driving clubs (car pooling) was encouraged.<br>  <br>  People were encouraged to save fat which could be turned into glycerin; if this isn't what you're looking for post an edit and I'll try to help.

7J7Tnnfpaa	Well, as almost everyone already stated, he tore her abdomen into the womb with his teeth. When Bella knelt to catch the cup full of blood, Renesmee was so big she couldn't handle the movement and the sac with the amniotic sac tore apart and the baby was choking, which leads to Edward trying to save both Bella and the baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  There you go!|`|hGVkInSnaa	He called up his friend The Fairy Godmother and she used a spell to magically remove it.

0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	The term "subconscious" has come along way since it came into vogue as a Freudian topographical metaphor, evolving and changing in meaning and function as it might relate to many different dynamic and nondynamic theories.<br>  <br>  Although more seen as a function of the unconscious, most dynamic perspectives would still view  the subconscious as mostly a reflection of defensive mechanisms essential to the integrity and cohesiveness of "self" (or at least to the perception of integrity).<br>  <br>  But subconscious perception and mundane terms seem more at home in more cognitive (and even some eastern perspectives).<br>  <br>  From that point of view perception (whether external or internal [thoughts]) is seen as the basis for reality and undergo figure/ground transformations (or selective attention), based on a change in status (e.g., interest). The perception is then attached with certain criteria (e.g., danger, no danger) that lead to  emotion/s which then bring perceptions into a consciousness, although a somewhat biased manner. Prior to evaluation, perceptions are seen without bias or attachment (what some eastern perspectives call "mindfulness") and as such are seen as forming the basis of a common reality.<br>  <br>  However, there are a number of issues to iron out. For example, it is not clear on what basis one selectively attends to a particular perception.  Figure and ground effects may be determined by both dynamic and non dynamic factors.  Nondynamic factors may include how well we are able to match up certain perceptions to prototypical cognitive schema which include numerous cognitive/emotive judgments, allowing us to react quickly- helpful to our survival. Modification is ongoing and the result of consequences which hopefully make the "average" more accurate (but not necessarily). As such it would be the function of ego (consciousness) to mediate and bring us more and more in touch with a common reality. From this perspective, emotions are seen as much more than simple distortions of reality., but rather increasingly enhance and define schema through many communicative and feedback loops.  They can certainly distort our underatnding   but are more likely to refine it. <br>  <br>  I have a soft spot for the original Christian (gnostics) who might have felt (with other terminology) that the subconscious perception of the supramundane was the anchoring point for a common reality.|`|cL0aHkYEaa	Hmm.  This is an "interesting question."  <br>  <br>  Being somewhat biased towards the Jungian slant on things, the subconscious strikes me more as a reservoir than as an organ of perception.  As a reservoir (aka the Collective Unconscious) it includes the mundane, but also the divine and everything in between, as archtypes upon which we draw, and by which we presumably are anchored.  <br>  <br>  So there seem (for me) to be both yeses and noes in response to your question--yes for subconscious anchoring, yes for collective connectivity; but no for subconsious perception, and no for subconscious perception of mundane as an exclusive category.|`|mXUKca6naa	...agree (with s7e7v7e7n7)...<br>  ...the [sub]conscious perception of the mundane, form the anchoring basis of a common reality..|`|A01w1dHqaa	There is no mundane in eternity. Only your perception with thoughts from the past, makes it appear that way.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	More likely the actual existence of mind independent objects forms the basis for common reality.|`|Jj0zcJLwaa	Sure.

One way would be to create a layer and then add the shape on, then put a text box on top of it.<br>  <br>  It seems that Photoshop is actually harder to use when you want to do just-for-fun things like that, as it's a professional program meant for enhancing images. <br>  <br>  HP's free photo software has a thought-bubble stamp.

IIa4efh5aa	One might argue that the pact helped facilitate Nazi aggression by guaranteeing that Germany wouldn't be fighting a two-front war.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Good question -- it certainly left Hitler's hands free to deal with Poland and those two staunch Polish backers: England and France.  But, I think Hitler would have caused a war eventually no matter what.  His best bet would have been to attack the Soviet Union first -- and that would have been the best idea as well, because the USSR would have stumped the hell out of Hitler in the end, just as it did.  It might have taken longer, though.|`|EIK4TaWoaa	Europe was already at war. The Fascists won in Spain. Italy was fighting in the Balkans. Poland was invaded and divided between Nazi Germany and the USSR. <br>  <br>  The Nazi-Soviet pact was a strategic move to to keep the USSR out of the fight until Nazi German defeats France and England. Both France and England have already declared war on Germany the second Germany invaded Poland. <br>  <br>  In Mein Kampf Hitler mapped out a plan to defeat England and then have an Anglo-German alliance to invade Russia and push the Slavs back to the Urals. Next German would repopulate the Ukraine with German farmers making the Third Reich both the most important agricultural state as well as the most important industrial state in Europe.<br>  <br>  The Nazi-Soviet pact was a step in that plan. With the Luftwaffe's defeat in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion (the invasion of England) was canceled.<br>  <br>  Why Hitler ordered the invasion of the USSR without defeating England first is still mystery. If Hitler had settled for peace in 1941 we still might have a Nazi Germany (with a greater Reich) today.|`|aDZyh2jzaa	russia was Innocent, hitler only made that pact so he could concentrate his army on the rest of europe without interference from russia.

mXUKca6naa	...agree...|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Be careful what you wish for, cuz you just might get it all.  I think this phrase relates to people who want it all, eventually can't handle it when they achieve it and get burned in the end. It points out that we should be happy with a modest means.|`|KifOGNxzaa	it depends on your values. If you would be willing to endure, then the big fire would be the best choice, conversely if the thought of your own flesh burning before your eyes (assuming your eyes aren't already burnt out) is not worth the bigger fire, then choose the small. Yes i realize this is a metaphor, saying would you rather choose something greater, or safer but the answer stays the same. they both can harm you in a way.|`|6QDaqIXbaa	That saying is so silly lol of course a small fire that warms you rather than big fire that burns you...<br>  I think it's referring to success or life, where it's sometimes better to just get what u need rather than what u want, you know? Better to do good in the job your in ad get a pay rise than steal someone elses idea and get the promotion because you'll only get burned. Sometimes settling for less is settling for more.|`|B36hpSCsaa	i think it means to follow that small spark within your heart that lights your conscience showing you that the path of being true to oneself, may at times seem dark and cold, it is far better to be feel the warmth of ones soul then the burn of those who has sat their world ablaze, yet lack that spark of self worth...|`|RLqmrHlIaa	Sounds like a satire on wealth.

And worked on the Hobbit nearly 7 years prior to that. Those are both in the top 10 or 12 best-selling books in history. 3 years is nothing to an author. That's all you have to make fun of someone with?|`|vmmMqhxXaa	Yes.  Plenty of authors have done this, from Ray Bradbury ("Something Wicked this Way Comes" has an entire chapter that reads, "Nothing much happened the rest of the day.") to James Patterson, whose chapters are so short I've quit reading him.  Personally, I think he's panderoing to the short attention span of Americans these days, but that's my opinion.<br>  <br>  You're the writer.  It's your book.  Even if the above examples don't seem to apply to you, and even (maybe especially) if you feel you're trail blazing, do what your gut tells you.|`|2f434a3d36a890ac928c56ee8b8c820daa	I'm not sure what you mean in your question really.  An example from a published work would be helpful - an example that springs to mind is Stephen King's IT, which has several 'Interludes', in which he explores the history of the town he writes about.  They're not necessary to the plot but provide more texture.  They're longer than a paragraph though.  The only other thing I can imagine you mean are the short quotes at the start of chapters, which are called epigraphs.  <br>  <br>  Don't get too hung up on the names of sections.  Realistically, the 'bit in the middle' is your story I'm afraid.  You can set it out how you like - it doesn't need special name.  Just write it.|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	What I have seen is a storybreak.  This is a transitional chapter that usually redirects the action down a new storyline.  It's only really effective if, by the end of the novel, both the old storylines and the new storylines converge and resolve together.  Otherwise it seems like two books included between the same covers.|`|SFxQyTfJaa	yes you can -.- you can do anything you like in a book when you don't exaggerate -.-<br>  you can have some empty sites... change perspective from one I-perspective to another I-perspective...<br>  <br>  ;D<br>  have fun|`|AVYBazOEaa	its your book;- Do anything you want (: x

AA10015648	Well, if an nonconformist is forced to do something as universally conformist as growing up from a teenager into an adult, he will naturally try to fight that. <br>  <br>  Holden is fighting against time, fighting against nature, because he sees children as young and innocent and sees adults as perverts and phonies. It totally affects how he sees life, like when he sees the F word on the wall of his sister's school, it makes him so angry because he imagines it was a perverty man who sneaked in and scrawled the word... when in fact, it was probably a kid who did it. <br>  <br>  He doesn't want things to change - notice how often he talks about how he loves the museum because it never changes, or he's concerned about the lake freezing because it changes and the fish and ducks are forced to act a certain way because of the change.<br>  <br>  He's not talking about mummies in the museum, he's talking about himself. He wants things to stay predictable, to stay how he likes them. He's not talking about ducks flying away from the frozen lake, he's talking about himself needing to change as time forces him to grow up.|`|ckxf4y8gaa	because he's crazy.|`|EWIVAPx8aa	hey karenjo you're a smartaasss<br>  <br>  Holden's just a mixed up kid.  He judges everything as a sellout and therefore hates himself.|`|vmmMqhxXaa	Holden is a nonconformist, not an unconformist.  I only mention this because it may be important enough to your teacher to mark off points for the wrong word.  "Un" implies that he was a conformist once, and has undone that.  "Non" means he refuses to be one or is unable to be one.<br>  <br>  If you read the book, I promise you that you'll find the answer.

By the way, it is the principle that they are assumed innocent until proven guilty.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	u sure?|`|4LeHbW2raa	One of the important things about the justice system is that it is impersonal . Wrong doers are not punished just so everyone else can feel good about themselves . It is not about revenge( which is what wronged parties usually want ) . It is about maintaining order in society. <br>   However the justice system does not inhabit an alternate universe where everything works perfectly and the only person who is to blame is the criminal himself. The system recognizes that we live in an imperfect world and that human beings themselves are not perfect. So it makes allowances for the fact that there may have been circumstances which forced an otherwise law abiding citizen into doing something dreadful . If it concludes that this is indeed is the case and that the person in question is repentant and does not pose a threat to society then it is right in tempering justice with mercy. <br>   A lot depends ,of course, on the nature of the crime .|`|B36hpSCsaa	it seems like one found guilty by a court of law today has more rights then the victim...they had such a bad childhood, we should all get together and hold a pity party...  uh, hello...   its called victim for a reason.  sorry if it sounds barbaric, yet mercy should only apply to the rope one has to waste on such a neck...|`|ETurhACOaa	But think of it form the other point of view what if you were being convcted of something when you were innocent, it would be harder to prove your innocence then it would be for someone to prove your guilty

VPptQSBHaa	Politically correct= standards and terms society has set up as means for "equality" and "respect"  amongst all people.    Respect= Unlike being politically correct, using common sense to show kindness toward others.  Respect has the same idea, it's just something people know they should do.  There are no set rules, you know the wrong way and the right way to treat people.  Respect is choosing the right way.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	POSITIVELY  CORRECT    AND  POLITELY  CORRECT|`|7lI8oFFJaa	Respect is measure of  Gentleness, goodness of  Person and PC is measure of Smartness.|`|V69ugUNbaa	Political correctness is the lowest common denominator approach to living in harmony. It is a brainwashing technique used to encourage epsilons to fabricate a state of mind where differences are overlooked and no independent thought is allowed.  In this context, respect sees differences and celebrates them where appropriate, but allows criticism or the will of the individual where judged (by the individual) as acceptable.|`|pnoQFcT4aa	Respect is earned by the individual, and political correctness is legally enforced towards a group. Are we not individuals first and the colour of our skin, creed, religion, race, etc. second?|`|s92cftVAaa	respect is about the value of the other, pc is about what the mass thinks you should be saying (not thinking!) about-to the other|`|LjhBAzLVaa	I'm going to give it to you straight and simple:    Political Correctness: You care about how others perceive you.    Respect: You do care about THAT person.    Caring about how others perceive you is only caring about yourself.|`|AA11635601	Political correctness is a behavior forced through bullying.  Respect is a behavior voluntarily given.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Political correctness has a lot to to with passion   There were major demonstrations (for Dallas) when a non-black, Asiatic shop owner offered a special for "colored people" the term being unacceptable  Involved in the protests were the NAACP - the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - apparently they could use the term but no one else.|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Respect is genuine, and PC is just to avoid getting in trouble.|`|mMnRmYvNaa	Respect is personal, arises from the heart, arises in the moment as an existential reality.    PC is doctrinaire, arises out of an ideology that is always as it is (PC people think it's true, I think it's nonsense), and is a form of group obsession rather than a personal existentially valid posture of the heart speaking to the moment.    There is nobody and no thing in this world or any other that I always respect. So you can't get respect from me based on some always true doctrinaire ideology. Respect from me is like applause. I give it when I see something that seems praiseworthy. No idea held by the PC crowd seems to me always praiseworthy -- in every possible application all to time -- i.e. to thing or person X and time T, where X and T are functions of an unlimited variable.    I will never do anything for PC reasons. I will never accept mass-mind mush as the basis for my conduct. I will always endeavor to be respectful of and show respect for anything or anybody who (or which) appears in that moment to be worthy of same. This happens, for me, a fairly small percentage of the time, and it's not because I'm a cynical curmudgeon (though it's true, I am), it's simply because so much of what's out there is pure Kaka -- the people Kaka -- what they do Kaka -- their intentions Kaka. I wish it weren't so. People put on a fairly good show for the first 30 years of my life (1947 till 1976), but then after that, they started to decline, got worse and worse, now are mostly just Kaka. I'm ready to respect. Bring on the worthies and they will have my respect -- but you can't pry it out of me with an ideology that I'm supposed to join to make someone else feel more comfortable. I'm not a joiner. Eagles don't flock, see?|`|hvJQSUOQaa	Respect is an opinion.  Political correctness is much more definite.  Ex: it's politcally correct to say "happy holidays" because not everyone celbrates the same holiday: a fact. It is NOT a matter of respect, because it's not anyones right to determine how a person may feel about hearing "happy" to a holiday they don't celebrate.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	IMO respect says we are all equal, but PC has been used to control anything or anyone who doesn't fit a rigid philosophy/ideal that in itself is almost always incredibly limiting. In other words, I find it to be utter nonsense.

AA10740562	Natural light from the sun is about equal intensity over the range of the visible light spectrum as well as beyond (into the infrared and ultraviolet, beyond what humans are capable of perceiving) This is why it seems more "whiter". Also, the brightness of sunlight on a cloudless day is something like 100,000 candlepower per square meter (according to wikipedia) Whereas studio lighting is not equal intensity through the light spectrum. There are more gaps between the red and blue ends which could add a slight bit of color - perhaps toward the red or blue - depending upon the type of light. Shadowing would be more pronounced, especially if there are multiple light sources. Some objects may be more prone to reflecting more light depending on the direction the lights are pointed and the positioning of objects. Basically, indoor lighting would not light up every spot in the room with equal brightness and more lighting sources would add to a shadowing effect. You as a photographer would have to use your judgment when it comes to that. It is very difficult to duplicate the light that comes from the sun. Indoor lighting would not be nearly as bright|`|Cc2Yb9DKaa	I would characterize natural like as a broad-spectrum white light mixed with the diffused light of the atmosphere and surrounding objectslike trees or buildings.    Studio light involves the use of artificial incandescent or florescent lighting with and without filters from any arrangement of angles and intensities.  Studio light offers more control over the elements of mood, shade, highlight and contrast.    Depending on the atmosphere you are trying to project in your photograph, natural lighting may work better because people recognize it implicitly.  Studio lighting offers a greater range of effect, so some work may turn out better with intentional lighting.|`|vZMN82U8aa	well, daylight is 6500k, indoor lamps are warmer, because they tend to be a lower temperature... around 4500k..     BUT photofloods and studio lamps are calibrated to 6500k daylight. and you can get pure whites in a studio... day after day after day... the sun varies...     you can control studio lamps, you cant really control the currant bun...     and everyone tweaks their end prints in photshop or the like...     and if youre getting shoadows, then your lighting rig isnt set up correctly... unless you want shadows...     rule of thumb, over expose by a stop, gives pure washed out whites, underexposing a sstop builds colour saturation and richness...|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Studio light...good studio light..is often an attempt at looking natural in an unnatural setting.     PS, natural shouldn't be "whiter"..strobes should be daylight balanced or lighting custom white balanced.

AA11664474	On average, 50 years, but this took into account that a lot of children died in infancy and a lot of young people died young.  There were also a lot of elders offsetting that.  <br>  <br>  Your inidividual life expectancy was set by factors in your own life.  If you survived infancy and didn't die an accidental death or from a number of diseases, you had a great chance of reaching 80 years old.|`|lByah6n7aa	50 years|`|4UIR1YuQaa	This website has a chart with all the information you need.<br>  <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.h...</a>

Then color in with black on the new layer above the original drawing; make sure that color is selected in the layer options, this way you will be able to see through the black on to the original drawing.

AA12268495	I am sure Edward felt sympathy towards Rose. However, just because someone had a traumatic experience, doesn't make them less of a jerk. As callous as it sounds, Rose has had decades to heal her wounds.     Besides, you should keep in mind that Edward isn't just privy to her memories of the rape ...he also is able to hear all of the mean, selfish thoughts as well.     I am sure that Edward *tried* to comfort her... in his own way. But he is a little socially awkward, and he tends to hold people up to very high standards. So, although I am sure he was doing what he thought he should, Rose. probably didn't appreciate his attempts.|`|9HCypvHJaa	I think that Edward probably did feel sorry for her, but I think because of Rosalie's personality it is impossible for anyone besides Emmett to get close to her. And I don't think Edward necessarily dislikes Rose, he just cares for Bella a lot more.|`|It3m1WpAaa	I think he definatly felt some sympathy for her.  I don't think he likes her that muh because    A) She hates Bella.  B) She thinks everyone should love her.    I mean Edward isn't a mean guy - he prob. felt bad for her!!    Hope I helped!|`|kC8i88d2aa	yes|`|uIfbWdsvaa	i dont think he ever liked her because what she did after the rape was wrong even tho it was revenge and wat they did to her was wrong, edward never stooped down to tht level. I mean he may have killed a few humans but not out of vengeance like she had. plus she hates bella, but actually in breaking dawn even tho edward at first didnt want renessme rose helps bella a lot, even tho its out of selfishness|`|MkmorJEeaa	I'm sure he felt sympathy for her.|`|CoNUK7sKaa	i'm sure he felt terrible about it, but i'll bet he thought that he was invading on her thoughts and that it wasn't something she would usually share or bring up with him around, so it really wasn't his place to talk about it to her.|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	A) Vampires can't cry  B) Maybe, he did show a little, but it might have made him feel she just wanted attention.|`|FBMDK4lHaa	she probably doesnt want to talk about it to edward and to be fair she had her revenge well a pretty good revenge and wasnt it the man she was supposed to marry aswell wasnt he drunk with his mates or maybe i got that bit wrong but yeah he prob doesnt like seeing that in her head but edward can chose to block out her thoughts give her privacy so im sure he respected her thoughts and didnt listen to them|`|a4wuHrkKaa	I think he felt sympathy for her, but her thoughts and anger were probably so intense that she made it hard to live with her. I don't think that he doesn't like her. He thinks of her as a sister. Do you like everything about your siblings? Rosalie doesn't have the nicest personality, so after 50 years together, it can get annoying to deal with that anger and know that you have an eternity to deal with it. She doesn't like Edward that much either, and that's because he wasn't attracted to her like every other man she knew. But they do care for each other and feel like family.

jvPToF4Laa	I really liked the Sherlock Holmes stories. Light, quickly moving mysteries. If the author hides any clues from you, he at least has the courtesy to say so.    Verne's book is also a quick read. A bit dated, since he was trying to combine new technology and travelog, and both of these have changed.    I watched a ~40 hour BBC version of War and Peace when I was younger. I love to read. Still could not make it past about page 200 in W&P.

YdJJ9wQTaa	Harry Potter has sold around 400 million copies. Just the first Twilight book has sold around 42 million copies.<br>  <br>  The Bible and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" have sold over 1 billion.

His Dark Materials (15 mil), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (15 mil), The Inheritance Cycle (15 mil), Narnia (120 mil), The Lord of the Rings (150 mil), and The Da Vinci Code (57 mil)  have all recently gotten movies.|`|C2FkuVESaa	Hype is a negative thing, something I would attribute to Twilight but not HP.

Same with A Series of Unfortunate Events.<br>  <br>  The only two books I think have been "Hyped" in recent years (that is, given more attention and acclaim than their writing is due) are Twilight and Eragon.<br>  <br>  One is a badly-written, four-books-of-whiny-angst series about vampires, TWOO WUV, and self-insertive female leads.<br>  <br>  The other is an over-written, god-knows-how-many-books-long ripoff of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and The Dragonrider Series by McCaffrey. It also happened to be published by Paolini's mommy and daddy, which really decimated his cred as a writer, at least with me.<br>  <br>  Both abuse thesauruses and play on a type of tension.

ljKqWVZHaa	In my opinion, a good writer is able to make pretty much every story exciting, just add some conflict. I realize that you've left out a lot and all, but just make sure there's some kind of ordeal for the protagonists to overcome. Also write the story in the same mood as you want the genre to be, and you should be good ^^  Although a 12-year old girl and her friend running off to Rome sounds a bit impossible, but that's just my opinion ^^  Go for it though! =D    I don't know how to send it to a publisher though... Look one up and mail the story?|`|SygvUa0Eaa	You could most definitely send it to a publisher, but I hardly doubt they'd read it without reason. Have something attached to it, giving them a recommendation from a teacher, or someone else that might have a good word in it. Otherwise, they probably won't bother...    It might cost a little to send it, but if you want to get an agent, it's going to cost a lot.|`|Xc02z608aa	If you have to pay a publisher, then they are scamming you.    First, you have to write it, finish it, edit it, revise it, edit it, until it is in perfect condition.  Then you submit it to literary agents.

1Ad7jJgwaa	It might. If you assume negatively upon everything, it means you have low expectations of yourself and others, which in turn creates a worse-off scenario. If you assume positively, then you have better expectations of yourself and others, and things will turn out better.<br>  <br>  Morals are what we choose to be and do. If we can choose to be optimistic, then yes. If we can't, then no. That's really what it boils down to.|`|Dp1dN2HLaa	Optimism is the reason that so many people get depressed;<br>  ie; they build up their hopes, and are then dissappointed..<br>  <br>  Stoicism is a much better system. Do your best, then what happens happens.|`|OqveEUqkaa	No. They are not the same or opposite value.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Yes being optimistic promotes a positive attitude, which tends to be much more beneficial and moral than a negative attitude, which could be generated from a pessimistic attitude.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	It certainly can, but it is one of those things that, if overdone can be "polly-anna-ish."<br>  <br>  The musicians playing on the deck of the Titanic may have been showing optimism when they continued to play, but one can easily see this gesture as misplaced.<br>  <br>  One synonym of "optimism" could be "enthusiasm," which etymologically means, "filled with God."  In this regard, one does not have to have a religious faith to know that the term has meaning other than bursting with the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  I think the best example of both of these terms is a little movie by Roberto Benigni called, "La vita è bella" (Also known as "Life Is Beautiful").|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	OH hell no! Just kidding I think optimism or at least optimistic people have a lot more respect for others and in life in general. Well then again I am a optimistic person but I have had gf tell me I have the morals of.....well never mind.  :)|`|j1E4aowoaa	Yes it does, it depends on what one is optimistic about, if its a positive pursuit. If the question is having in mind that its a good thing, then it does, because first of all, it directly counters pessimism.|`|BAR1u0shaa	no because if you are negative u are negative if u are positive u are pisitve, nither have any moral value the only value in either is opinion.|`|RLqmrHlIaa	No. I cannot see any correlation.

Soviet propaganda against America.|`|AA10310586	Oh man, what is your age? do you still believe in such crap?   When I was little I believed that nazis were not human, that they have blue blood and nor red, and that there best day was when they killed little children. It is just a rumor that was left in minds of not very clever people before the collapse of USSR.     Do you really think, that if Reagan called USSR "empire of Evil", then russians dream is to make evil to anyone? He called us so, because communism is absolutely different from capitalism. Capitalist say that deeds of one man bring happiness to everyone, because he thinks of effectivness and quality to compete with others. Communists say that nobody should compete but everyone should be equal and modest in their desires. Communism and Capitalism cannot live in one reality. They are forced to destroy one another.  So Reagan ment that life of USA depended on destroying USSR, because otherwise USSR will destroy USA. So of course he saw himself as GOOD and USSR as EVIL. From here it was opposite. But in USSR live the same people as everywhere. They love children, they want to be happy, they want peace and they believe in God (by the way the same as yours - russians are christians).     So please, if you want to know more about history (not only russian) then take serious books on topic. It will help you not to post such questions in the future.    Best luck.

9XLUSMndaa	wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre<br>  <br>  I want to make sure you're not really asking two questions here:<br>  1.  How did the Nazis prove the Soviets did it?<br>  2.  Who really did it?<br>  <br>  In answer to #2, there is absolutely no doubt now that the Soviets did it.  Gorbachev apologized, if nothing else.<br>  <br>  In answer to #1, the victims were last seen alive in the captivity of the Soviets.  The Nazis called the Red Cross in to investigate.  As to what forensic evidence they produced, I don't know and I didn't see it in the link above.  Certainly it fit the modus operandi of the NKVD (small caliber round to the base of the skull, I believe).<br>  <br>  So from where we are now, your question is probably moot, if you're trying to stir something up.  Of course, during the war Roosevelt and Churchill would have loved it it could have been proved that the Nazis did it, not their allies, the Soviets.  So there was some of that sentiment lurking over the whole thing.<br>  <br>  Parenthetically I should add that the Lenin or Stalin withdrew from the Geneva Conventions in the 1920 - a capitalist artifact, don't you know?- and therefore may have done nothing illegal.  The Nazis reciprocated in their treatment of Soviet POWs - which I think is understandable.|`|N86vHKxtaa	See the link.  Essentially, the Germans uncovered a mass grave and had photos from 1943.  In 1959, a Soviet KGB official admitted they had executed over 21,000 Polish POW's.|`|MFF61HvDaa	The Germans didn't attack Russia until June of 1941 and didn't reach Smolensk until July of 1941.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Source shows the accepted proposal made by Lavrenty Beria, to Stalin, to murder/execute all Polish officers held as  prisoners by the Soviets.

AA11664474	The Japanese military made that decision with a faulty knowledge of what the American reaction would be.  They thought destroying the American fleet all at once would force Americans to butt out of the Pacific.  They also knew if the US declared war on Japan, Germany would declare war on them.  They didn't think the US could handle two wars and they guessed they'd put the priority on Europe.  <br>  <br>  Japanese diplomats and those officers educated in the US knew better.  They knew how big the US was and how vast the resources were.  They also knew from the Americans they'd met that they would fight.  The diplomats knew it was a road to ruin.  The officers suspected it was unless they caught the entire fleet at Pearl.  <br>  <br>  Many world leaders today still have no concept of how big and strong the US is.  Saddam Hussein learned in the First Gulf War.  He knew better than to give the US an excuse to come in again.   Qaddifi learned when his family compound was bombed and he came very close to being killed in a surgical strike.   The US cannot be destroyed by force of arms.|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	The Island of Hawaii was a symbol of American imperialism. The U.S. basically annexed the island of Hawaii to exploit its natural resources. Japan felt that they were right in their own version of the Monroe Doctrine by, as you say, invading every nation in its proximity. But I view the attack on Pearl Harbor as a preemptive strike. And the military hierarchy in Japan felt it was a good way to strike a blow to America's Pacific fleet. But the U.S should not have been shocked by an attack. Years before the attack the U.S. placed strong economic sanctions against Japan. And they placed a block on Japan's oil reserves in Indonesia. And Japan seen those actions as a act of war.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Japan needed oil to fuel its war machine so it was going after more territory and especially oil countries.  The US had warned Japan time and time again and finally were moving on an oil embargo.  Japan knew it was a matter of time until US ships would enforce it, or even worse, get drawn into the conflict some how.  The Japanese generals decided to strike first.<br>  <br>  You have to understand it was a tactical stroke of genius on Japan's part.  They put about 80% of US naval capacity out, and this set the US back a few years while we had to repair and build new ships. <br>  <br>  Also examine it from Japan's perspective in 1941.  They had taken out their main rival and now had command of the seas for the next few years.  We didn't hit the Pacific beachheads til what... 44 or 45?|`|CE4hcUmhaa	In general, the reason was raw materals.  Japan desperatly needed oil, metals,rubber, etc. to sustain the invasions of China, Manchuria, and Korea which it had undertaken as early as 1927.  <br>  <br>  There was also a strong "Asia for the Asians" factor- the Japanese did beleve that they were racially superior and were entitled to reign over the other Asian/Pacific races.<br>  <br>  Propagandized as "liberation" of the Asian races, Japan launched operations to occupy the western democracie's colonial possessions.  The Dutch and French had already surrendered, and the Brits were in no position to offer more than token resistance to defend their colonies.  The only potential threat to Japan's war aims was the US Fleet at Pearl.<br>  <br>  Japan had hoped that f the US Fleet could be destroyed, their armed forces would have a free hand in the Pacific long enough to solidify their gains and exploit the resources they had captured.<br>  <br>  Realistically, Japan never intended to "defeat" the US, their goal was to end up with a negotiated peace and hanging on to their conquests.<br>  <br>  Tactically, the Pearl strike was a success, but strategically a huge error.  Japan had not counted on the fervent nationalist reaction of the US population.  There is a strong possibility that had Japan NOT struck at Pearl, they might have been able to accomplish their goals.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	They believed that with England ensconced in a war in Europe, if America could be taken out quickly, that they would have complete run of the Pacific and could create a new Asia dominated by Japan.  As the one lady said, the reason was that the Japanese were racist(I know, what a concept, most people only think that Americans are racist), they believed that we are of a mongrel racial mix and both Hitler and Tojo believed that 1) democracies were failing and no democracy had the same willpower to fight as a dictatorship and 2) they both thought that their soldiers were better than the soft Americans.  They believed that we would not fight.<br>  <br>  Japan had the run of the Pacific, for all of 6 months, from Pearl Harbor(Dec 7, 1941) until Midway (June 7, 1942) after that, Japan was being pushed back by the weak Americans with the back of our hand while the rest of us were trying to defeat Hitler in Europe.<br>  <br>  The leadership of Japan believed with all of their heart that one quick decisive battle would defeat the USA and we would sue for peace leaving Japan free to do what they wanted in Asia.<br>  <br>  whale|`|gd0oBfOhaa	They believed the U.S. was ready to enter the war anyways so they tried to start a pre-empitve strike on the U.S. Pacific Navy in order to cripple it.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for them the U.S. was waiting for this to happen and just hours before the Pearl Harbor attack was launched, the main ships of Pearl harbor left to coincidentally go on Naval interdiction patrols.<br>  <br>  The Japanese attacked pearl harbor due to the fact that is was an important naval base for the U.S. and because the U.S. had enacted an oil embargo against the Japanese which crippled their armored divisions and their navy.<br>  <br>  It didn't really matter since the U.S. was looking for a reason to enter the war anyways.

I'm not sure that it's important to the plot to know about her heavily lidded eyes, but I always got the impression that it told the readers she used to be very beautiful before her years in Azkaban, but also considers herself superior to everyone else. I'm not saying that everyone with heavily lidded eyes has that superior look, but it could be imposing on someone with Bellatrix's personality. I always had a very clear mental picture of her face even before Hellena Bonham Carter was so perfectly cast for the movies.|`|6QDaqIXbaa	Heavily lidded eyes can be a stereotype of an evil face. Evil people in books and movies are normally described as having slits for eyes or small beady eyes etc, no-one evil ever has nice big wide eyes or eyes as blue ad the sky.|`|y5HeFW03aa	It's basically someone who has big eyelids...<br>  I do, and often it changes the way someone looks... it alters her face and so she wants you to build a clear picture|`|IWaxUqDzaa	I think that the reason why this is so important to Bella's character is that it distinguishes her from Cissy. It also is a way to show that she is not exactly a light and happy person and that she has a bit of a goth/emo/psycho side to her. These eyes are somewhat heavily lidded:  <a href="http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PMO1896.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PMO18...</a> (It really just means that they are dark eyelids against Dark eyes.)

5I01tsgYaa	For English Lit being trained to read means being able to read a text and critically examine it within different contexts.  Basically, being able to take what you know about the author and the time period and breaking down the text to obtain a deeper understanding of it.  Example, in the Canterbury Tales, Chaucer describes one of the characters as wearing red stockings.  One may think that he is simply giving you a visual of the character so you can imagine her better.  But if you study Chaucer and learn about the time he lived in you would know that red was considered a flamboyant color - and to wear red stockings indicated that the person was oversexed, loose, or promiscuous.  So in this way, you can learn to see the deeper subtleties in stories, poems, etc.  <br>  Some people think that this is the only way to truly enjoy a text.  I disagree, and I was an English major myself.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|AA11315777	I agree comepletely with Zevokes. Being capable of reading text and reading comprehension are two entirely different things. If you can comprehend while you're reading, it captures your attention.|`|SupWrLRIaa	Reading training means different things to different people. To the principle portion of the English department (with whom I have had considerable contact) it means teaching someone the "proper" way of thinking about what one is reading. That is to say, the method which brings the student to the same conclusion as the professor, thereby making them 'right,' if you follow me. It is a basic method of indoctrination, as clumsy as it is sad, yet nonetheless backed with the force of infinite authority and therefore extremely effective.<br>  <br>  The remainder of society is wrongfully convinced that they can teach independent thought, that they can teach people how to draw their own conclusions. The basic concept, and to me this seems quite obvious, is entirely fallacious. You cannot teach someone to not follow a teacher. That is beyond the scope of basic logic. If someone does not know how to ignore convention when they come to view conventions, it is unlikely that the study of conventions will engender unconventionality . . . if you will.<br>  <br>  In other words, reading training is the maintenance of the professorial belief system, altered only when the members of said institution skirt the rules by ignoring their training and thinking independently as they have since they were old enough to think in the first place. It is the closest thing to essential convention that there is.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Gulp, swallow.<br>  <br>  KK, not only did I major in English Literature, but graduated with Honours. I do not remember being "trained" to read books in a certain way, in fact I would sometimes disagree with my Lecturers about various themes in the set texts. In my opinion an independent mind is essential when analyzing English Literature.<br>  <br>  To answer your other question, yes I do read for entertainment. I love the Shopaholic books by Sophie Kinsella, Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Christ the Lord series, Harry Potter and thought that Bridget Jones's Diary was brilliant. <br>  <br>  But ... be aware that I have a very wicked sense of humour. On Y!A I'll deliberately ask a question that doesn't need to be answered e.g "How come the Famous Five never age?" just to see if anyone is smart enough to pick up that such a point doesn't need to be analyzed, that the joy of reading such a book is its pure innocence and simplicity.|`|qux14l0yaa	i remember taking Dickens at school, i hated him! now i like reading classical literature but never Dickens. Strange thing but i think that means that when the mother reads to her child stories s/he grows loving fiction and a mother who gets her child a Lab grows loving science books<br>  its the way things are presented to you in the begining|`|cs0YDOTbaa	i think the idea is that when reading a piece of literature the reader should be able to pick up on the subtle devices the author is using to convey the message or messages.|`|KCxbbPmjaa	how do you mean, trained to read? like, learning to read or learning to analyse what you read?|`|1cd986cb78bf32187073480d10431bedaa	by eating pickles.|`|QLnau0NNaa	people teach you how to read above a certian lvl lol|`|YkseyT7zaa	You learn to read, you are not trained to read|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I think I get what you mean. People who feel they are "trained" to read literature and analyze it and ponder it, right? I have encountered a lot of people who answer my questions and say things like, "I should know, I'm an English major" to try to sound impressive and whatnot and I honestly think that would be miserably unenjoyable. I mean, I like books and all, but only because they are relaxing and enjoyable. I don't like stressing over analyzing them and becoming deeply ponderous of the story. Perhaps that is why I hate reading certain books for school. Every chapter you have to analyze and it takes the joy out of reading it. I don't think anyone is particularly "trained' to read books. "Trained" to analyze them, yes. But I see it as a way of them thinking they are better than others, as far as their literary skills and abilities, which is completely untrue. Like you said, they tend to act "snooty" toward others about books. I hope I'm making sense, but that's just my opinion on the matter :)
SupWrLRIaa	It is a matter of instinct. Humans, individually, can accomplish very little. We are small, rather frail, and lack predatory and defensive skills.The scientific or technological contributions of any one person are far from rectifying or replacing this deficiency. Therefore we must turn to socialization in order to achieve the level of success in our basic environment that we desire. <br>  <br>  This same instinct is perverted slightly into the desire for romantic relationships, for 'love,' as it were. Combined with a desire to breed, this desire to form connections with other people creates a desire to be intimate, socially and physically, with a person suitable for breeding. Modern society and evolving psychology has changed or bastardized this somewhat, creating relationships between couples unable or incompatible for reproduction, but the basis for all of it lies with that.<br>  <br>  As for your final question, life is about what we make it. If people enjoy forming connections, then they can base their life on that. I wouldn't do it myself, despite being a fairly social person, but to each their own. I personally find my social life quite fulfilling, and would be unhappy to lose it, but there is pain there that could be avoided. I think it is worth it, but I couldn't tell you about yourself unless I knew you far better . . . which would rather defeat the purpose.|`|w8gBWpKTaa	People can be happy with themselves, that's why they understand how others can be too and that's why you don't get close to people, because your not happy with yourself.

Imagine you are born alone on Earth, i bet you will die in a few hours, whether being eaten by animal or frozen to death by chill winter. Hence we need each other to survive.<br>  <br>  Life has genetically programmed by nature to keep our survival rates higher. Today we have to live socially in society. In society we need partner to share information about what you experience and also about your partner experiences. Therefore we have to select our partner to be able to understand our nature (probably you haven't found one). When you found one then you would know that person is special someone.<br>  <br>  I have tried relationships with other people, but then my brain kept thinking about that special person and not the other way around. Well I couldn't believe it at first, but now I won't let that person go. <br>  (Note: I've tried to forget that person before, but everything was even more chaotic)|`|FoIxsunVaa	Relationships and marriage are one of the areas of life where there are the fewest laws and regulations. many religions claim to favor celibacy to marriage. Pop culture in the 21st century is less obsessed with 'love" and more with sex and other issues than culture has just about ever been. You live in a golden age where it isn't all about get married/have kids.<br>  <br>  Society is NOT obsessed over relationships. But PEOPLE are. If you think of it as everyone around you as being drug addicts and you just aren't addicted yet, that may help. But If you have such a hard time making FRIENDS, maybe being asexual is not your problem.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Yeah pretty much. Relationships are the basis of humanity. That being said, one SHOULD be happy with themselves before they enter a romantic relationship, not look for a relationship to make them better. But you also talk about platonic relationships. Those are important as well. Society obsesses over relationships because without them, we'd all cease to exist. We were put on this earth to love God, but God gave us people to love as well. Friends aren't a necessity, per say, but they are a blessing for many people. I don't have many friends either, almost no close ones anyway. But my husband is my best friend, and my mom and dad are close seconds. I don't know what I'd do without them.

To "see" what can't be seen with the human eye.<br>  <br>  To "feel", "see", and "hear" with the soul is being able to actually feel music, hear art, and see that which is merely drifting in the air...i.e. color, music . . .<br>  Art and music can "speak" to you.

i0J7K5Txaa	Well to be honest, if some one was pretending to be crazy he would see how everyone would react, treat, and speak to him/her.  A persons reaction to fear or some thing they can't understand says a lot about who they are and what they will do behind your back or even right in front of you.<br>  <br>  As far as Hamlet goes, I'm not to sure. . .  Just my two cents to the "...why would he pretend anyway...".<br>  <br>  Hope that helps when taking the events of hamlet in to mind.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Madness – both real and feigned – is at the heart of Hamlet. Famously, Hamlet’s "antic disposition" sparked a scholarly debate about whether Hamlet was completely sane, totally crazy, or something in between. If you look at the series of quotes on his madness that I've linked below, there is a strong case to be made that he is feigning.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Hamlet|`|yYiQuPacaa	At the beginning of the play Hamlet is merely pretending and that is only because he knows that people wouldn't mind saying anything around him because they think he is crazy. He wants to be around Claudius when and if the king ever admits he murdered Hamlet's father. But towards the end of the play, many critics do believe that Hamlet is indeed crazy.
dXW9cPWMaa	It honestly depends on the story being told and the characters in it. It's also a lot in what the reader needs to know as he or she reads through your plot.<br>  <br>  If the main character has a controlling interest in the story, he or she could be told in first person without it seeming a little strange; like you've said, it can create more empathy with the character because first person allows for personal thought, whereas third person does not (no matter what people say, hearing direct thoughts while in third person is an awkward jump into first person, not just hearing thoughts).<br>  <br>  The trick with first person is not saying the word "I" every other word. It can be done quite easily, and this mistake is taking the easy way out. No one ever said writing was easy. Well, someone probably did, but it's not, unless you pump out novels for your career. The other con of writing in first person is that the character has to either be everywhere the action is happening or be told what happened by another character. That's never really bothered me, but apparently it's a big deal to some people.<br>  <br>  Writing in third person can also create great empathy for the main character. If you'd rather write third person, you can also show the character's thoughts, but not in a direct single-quote or italics kind of way - it has to be more "he thought, she wondered" kind of thing to stay in the POV you've chosen. But writing in third person limited does allow for more of an outsider's view of the story, which can be better depending on what kind of story it is.<br>  <br>  Third person omniscient works best when you have more than one main character whose ideas need to be made known to the reader. I've heard this is most common for amateur writing, although I tend to see a lot of first person "I-I-I-me-I" writing, as well.<br>  <br>  Like I said earlier, it really all depends on the story being told and what the reader needs to know. Each story is meant to be told from a certain perspective, and you have to find that to make it really perfect. If that means trying a little bit of writing from several perspectives until you find the voice for the story, then do it. Neither one "makes more sense."|`|aeODdMATaa	characters point, it makes much more sense. I love it when I can put myself in their shoes.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	I prefer third person omniscient, with a writing style that will let me get into several character's heads. First person is okay, but often comes across poorly written, to me, and I don't like the limits that it imposes. As well, third person is less biased, which is nice.<br>  <br>  I don't know about you, but I don't require first person narrative to be able to imagine myself in a character's place, if that's what the story calls for. That's just empathy, and comes naturally when you read enough.|`|KCxbbPmjaa	it tottally depends on the writer. if i came up with a character that i really liked, got to know, mapped out, then i might write from their perspective, but i might have done that for all the other characters in the plot. you can fall in love with characters through the eyes of the narrator or from the description of the character from the third person. in the Black Magician trilogy when Akarin died, i felt really awful because i had got to know him through the narrative, not through Sonea's eyes. When Edward left Bella i felt really awful because of the words she used. it depends on what the author likes writing, and what they are best at. i personally don't prefer either, it doesn't really make a difference.|`|kbE7LbZUaa	i think readers can relate to stories when they can see being part of the character. That way all the emotion whether happy/sad can be followed and the reader can be put in the characters position.<br>  Very effective this way|`|GEOuOFvNaa	Character's point!|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	Many people like first person because they can relate to the main character and feel his/her emotions personally. It's a way for the audience to experience things they would not ordinarily be exposed to. First person is not effective for all books though; sometimes you want to see how an event is perceived by many characters.<br>  <br>  First person can sometimes lead to artificial plot devices such as having the person being on the scene of everything happening. <br>  <br>  There are great books written in all the points of view.

She needs some time to get her self confidence back up.|`|37E2yPGjaa	Yes it is from edward's point of veiw. It stops before the first kiss scene sadly :] i was waiting for tht part too. Meyer is probably not going to publish it becasue she said all the cullens would die and james would win if she continued which would not go along very well with the storyline of twilight. Maybe she will decide to finish it, but if she does, it wont be for a while :[It is put on hold indefinately.

OEjTgOuUaa	I've been a writer ever since I learned to read. If I didn't like the way a story ended, I made up my own ending! <br>  <br>  I used to write stories just for fun to share with my friends, but I never thought I could be a "real" writer. But I loved taking creative writing classes, and in one such class, my teacher told us on the first day, "Other people get paid for writing stories and you can too!" That helped to convince me that I could be a "real" writer. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, not very many people can actually make enough money from their writing to earn a living. So I had to get a "real" job that had very little to do with writing. But I never gave up my dream of having a novel published. I kept writing, and taking classes, and networking with other writers. Finally, in 2004 I decided to "get serious" about writing novels and submitting them. <br>  <br>  In Sept. 2007, I sold my third completed novel! It was released in Oct. 2008 and my second novel (actually the first novel I wrote) will be published in Sept. of this year. <br>  <br>  It was a long, tough road, but having my book on the bookstore shelves and getting fan mail from readers makes it all worthwhile!|`|6WXuVLCbaa	Well, its actually a long story; i started to write about 5 years ago. At first it were just little blobs of my imagination falling onto the paper, nothing actually with meaning or structure. But then somehow, I got it into my head that I want to actually become a writer. It helps me in so many ways; I thought maybe I could help others too. So I began, pouring out everything that I could think of, hoping it turned into story. But it didn't. <br>  <br>  It was a hard blow for me, knocking down my confidence and ability and for the next 2 years I didn't dare to lift up a pen, if i didn't "have to". But then one of those life-changing events came along and changed it all, as they do. <br>  I read over the story I produce all those years ago, and almost died of embarrassment. How childish it was!!<br>  I wanted to redeem my lost inspiration, and the imagination I kept bottled up inside me, so I started to edit. But I didn't like it. So I started again and again and again. Soo many times I cut, pasted, edited, threw away; today its still not complete, far from it but at least its on the right tracks.. in my head anyways.

7Srd7Pliaa	First, you talk to God and arrange for the perfect sky...  OK, seriously though you somewhat at the mercy of what the day gives you.  Some things that can help bring out some drama in the sky would be a polarizer or a yellow filter.  The yellow filter blocks blue, which darkens the sky.  Of course, everything is yellow so it works best with black and white pictures.  The polarizer will reduce glare and darken the sky some.  It will also bring out a little more definition in the clouds.<br>  <br>  Something you can do, is set your exposure a little low and use the flash to make up the difference in the subject.  In short, you are creating more contrast between the background and the subject with your lighting.  That way you can work with a featureless sky or one that has some natural drama.|`|i5OVORXgaa	The golden hours (sunrise and sunset) will give you the most dramatic skies.

Wpulf29Maa	Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy. While few philosophers would claim to be nihilists, nihilism is most often associated with Friedrich Nietzsche who argued that its corrosive effects would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history. In the 20th century, nihilistic themes--epistemological failure, value destruction, and cosmic purposelessness--have preoccupied artists, social critics, and philosophers. Mid-century, for example, the existentialists helped popularize tenets of nihilism in their attempts to blunt its destructive potential. By the end of the century, existential despair as a response to nihilism gave way to an attitude of indifference, often associated with antifoundationalism.|`|cs0YDOTbaa	ni·hil·ism       (nī'?-l?z'?m, nē'-)  Pronunciation Key  <br>  n.  <br>  Philosophy<br>  An extreme form of skepticism that denies all existence.<br>  A doctrine holding that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated.<br>  Rejection of all distinctions in moral or religious value and a willingness to repudiate all previous theories of morality or religious belief.<br>  The belief that destruction of existing political or social institutions is necessary for future improvement.<br>  also Nihilism A diffuse, revolutionary movement of mid 19th-century Russia that scorned authority and tradition and believed in reason, materialism, and radical change in society and government through terrorism and assassination.<br>  Psychiatry A delusion, experienced in some mental disorders, that the world or one's mind, body, or self does not exist.|`|GlteTTauaa	a Nihilist isn't an Atheist , you can believe in god and still be a nihilist , a nihilist is a person who believes everything ( including life , existence ,morality itself ) is pointless and meaningless .|`|yudzhdU6aa	I'm tipping that's a trick question!!! <br>  <br>  Very funny how many people you've caught out, though|`|Jj0zcJLwaa	It means you have sense.<br>  Lol at the above :D|`|FoIxsunVaa	Nothing, much.|`|VELnLnIKaa	athesist|`|MVY8xhXlaa	an existentialist- which means there's no moral code, that everything just "is" and no moral conclusions can or should be made- that we just live and die and nothing else makes any difference - no heaven above, no hell below- hmm, kind of like john lennon... basically a ship without a rudder (also like lennon)|`|Q59mF95vaa	It's a philosophy that believes that there is no purpose for living, no intrinsic value, and no goal.

rxfKjMTnaa	Ontology in philosophy, is the study of the nature of being, existence or reality in general, as well as of the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.|`|yUudoO1Raa	Ontology is a rather modern branch of metaphysics, helped along by the advocates of Ayn Rand's book "Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology." If ontology had existed to the degree then that her book pushed it to now, she might have written the follow up book. It would have been much more in depth.<br>  <br>  But reading that book will help you understand, because she begins at the beginning, with sensations; perceptions; existents; entities; identity; units; relationships; measurement; concept formation; differentiation, integration, commensurable characteristics; and before you are finished with Chapter Two she is already explaining how these affect our language in the form of adjectives, pronouns, conjunctions, etc.<br>  <br>  All those things are necessary to the understanding of ontology. Be sure to read the updated version that says "Expanded Second Edition" because the "expansion" is conversations Rand had with other philosophers who were interested in her ideas, but didn't quite understand them, themselves.<br>  see this for a link to Rand's book <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/themetaphysicalnaturalist/glossary/glossary-o" rel="nofollow">http://sites.google.com/site/themetaphys...</a>|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Ontology is the study of the categories of things that exist or may exist in some domain.

12VQ4ETcaa	The "old" (original) immigrants were mostly English, Scottish, and Dutch.  The "new" immigrants - Ellis Island timeframe here - were mostly Eastern and Southern European and Irish.  They came in larger numbers, were really poor and sometimes sick when they arrived, and they usually didn't speak much English, which by that time had become the most commonly used language in the US.  The "old" immigrants considered them racially inferior, dirty, and unskilled as laborers.  There were signs saying "No Irish or Dogs Allowed" in public places, and "No Irish Need Apply" for jobs.<br>  <br>  Notice that some of this same stuff applies now that more immigrants tend to be Asian or Mexican in origin.|`|ky3B42f6aa	The other poster "forgot" several million Scandinavians and Germans.  In any case, all the immigrants had/have one thing in common: they did/do the dirty work that the previous immigrants no longer want to dirty their hands doing.  This is still going on today.  Many in the USA want the illegals to "go home".  But, if they did, the entire service structure of the USA would collapse in less than a week, as there would be nobody to mop floors, empty the trash, clean toilets, or simply grovel for a buck.

If the words are commonly used together, any company may use them provided they are not in your industry.)<br>  <br>  Maybe with this information (the fact you need a Trademark instead of a Copyright) will help you look through those forms are figure it out. A Lawyer would probably charge you 2-4 hours to do this work, and they usually change $200-$500 per hour.
SngOU70Baa	I've been playing for little over 8 years now, and my advice to you is to JUST PLAY!! Skip the "learning basics", get some guitar tabs and start playing. You will learn all of that. I started of doing just that and I can now normally play anything buy ear. Just play your guitar, you dont need a teacher...noone taught me I did it all myself<br>  <br>  as for your fingers, I am not sure what you mean except I will say the tips of your fingers will hurt for a while but become use to it.|`|BJ8YPVJNaa	Practice practice practice. Even practice the stuff you barely know and already know.<br>  <br>  Bar chords are tricky cuz your hand will hurt being in the new position that you've not put your hand in. You prob know but to bar the frets you'll use your index finger. That's where it'll be difficult to learn bar. But if you've got the basic position down the rest comes easy.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And practice...<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll get it.|`|RJRiy9oMaa	oy... well chords make it alot easier! you can buy a chord chard in any music store. I suggest picking one up and self teaching a little.|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	I have to disagree with your dad.  Once you learn the basics, your need for a teacher is greatly reduced.  Like another answerer said, get a chord chart and learn them. Just keep on keepin' on and you will progress.  It helps if you can find someone to play along with.  You will motivate each other. Keep in mind, many of the great non-classical guitarists are self taught.  (It seems that classical guitarists are more lesson oriented, probably because it is a specific style with specific techniques and rules.)  The guitar is a wonderful instrument to learn whether you play in front of thousands or just for self enjoyment in your room.   Good luck.|`|kTlbsuKZaa	Th first tip is to have the correct length of finger nail on each hand. Assuming you are right handed then the nails on your left hand should lie flush with your finger tips. The finger nails length on your right hand is optional but Lindsey Buckingham has correctly defined nails and picks his guitar a lot. I started of with a single chord progression, just passing my finger over the 'A' chord first, then I went to the 'D' chord, then to 'A' then to 'E'. It is important to get the resonance of the note true and from chatting to others on the Internet I find it takes at least 3 months before your finger tips 'wear in'.<br>  Then have fun.|`|SGQwTMWLaa	One of the best tips I ever heard, start with bass guitar, less strings, no chords (traditionally) I've heard it is a lot easier to go from the bass to a guitar, instead of straight to a guitar.<br>  <br>  Another thing, when I started, my biggest problem is that I couldnt get my fingers to do that many things at once. So, I started playing Guitar Hero. While playing GH does absolutely NOTHING for learning how to actually play guitar, I believe it is EXCELLENT finger exercise.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|wA1dkeWRaa	Look at it this way.<br>  When you were a baby and couldn't walk, it took you time to learn how to walk before you could run, then, after you learned to run, you could climb on things.<br>  <br>  The same principles hold true for learnning to play an intrument.<br>  Listen to your old man and perfect the basics. Go to the library and get some books on theory. Panzanini Theoretical is a great book.<br>  <br>  Learn to walk before you try to run. It will make running a lot easier.|`|68dcxYiaaa	I did the same as you, started learning then stopped (moved to piano) I wish I had carried on but now i'm too swamped with school work to do so,<br>  So the only advise to give you is no matter how boring it might get doing the basics practise it over and over again, as well as this listen to some of the great guitar solos and think that with practise you will be that good!|`|Gabo2Uc7aa	Bar chords are hard...you need more strength in your fingers.  And yes building up calouses on your finger tips will help a lot.  Best way to do that is plain old practice.

I agree with your Dad that you should learn the basics first. It may be a bit boring but you're building a foundation for future learning, so it is necessary, just like you need to learn the alphabet before you can spell words and make sentences. Don't rush doing the barre chords, you'll get around to them if you hang in there long enough. You have to look for easy songs to do when you're first learning. Just because you like a song doesn't mean you're ready to play it.  It's all about your level of skill, which will improve if you are diligent.

Right before that Max is drinking as well.<br>  In 'Let It Be' it shows the streets of Detroit, and theres lots of violence and shooting...<br>  In Come Together theres a whole load of hookers walking aroundwearing somewhat revealing clothes<br>  In I WANT YOU, He's in one scene totally naked, but I didnt even realize it until the 56th time, literally, its on the side and his hands are covering up anything terribly horrible, but later in the song Sadie smokes a joint behind Jude.<br>  Right where they play 'Blue Jay Way' they all take acid, and theres another scene where you could guess that theres sex, but you don't know for sure. They're all still tripping when they run off the bus to a circus...<br>  Which leads us to the infamous sex scene, where we do see them, Jude and Lucy, Max with not only one, but two girls, Sadie and Jojo (never really revealed, and theres a reason why they did that, NOT insulting them, I swear to God), and Prudence and Rita, which is lesbian sex, I guess. You see Max's butt....but not really anything else, I mean, the way they're all posistioned..<br>  Then in Something, it shows Lucy lying on her side missing any sort of cover up, and Jude draws her. you see all the nude pictures on the wall best at this scene, you cant really ignore them. <br>  in Oh Darling, Sadie drinks Jack Daniels.<br>  Right before Strawberry Fields it zooms in on Jude's drug-of choice, and then proceeds to show him smoking it. the whole rest of the scene is like being high, kind of. Very imaginative, though..<br>  In Revolution, Jude gets in a fist fight with 3 people.<br>  In While My Guitar Gently Weeps Jude and Jojo are smoking a joint, and Jude asks if he wants another one (Jojo refuses, btw).<br>  In Across the Universe/Helter Skelter, everyone in the protest takes a beating, and Jude's hit on the head pretty bad, and he falls on the stairs and bleeds all over the place.<br>  Then there's another slightly nude scene, six girls standing on water, covered in body paint, you dont really notice that they're naked right away, though.<br>  In Happiness is a Warm Gun, they have the skanky nurse thing going on, all in short skirts and all. Max has a head injury at this time too...<br>  Soon after this, the first eff bomb is dropped by Lucy, at a 'peaceful march'<br>  Hey Jude, they drink beer in a bar...<br>  And, thats pretty much it.... except the credits, they show the water scene again but in technicolour<br>  <br>  ....yeah, I've seen this way too many times|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	Well, let's see, there's the scene where the English chap and little miss blondie have sex.

There's Joe Cocker's prostitutes when singing "Come Together."<br>  <br>  It's all very surreal and stretching...but it definately is not a PG movie.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Jude smokes weed before Strawberry Fields, I Wanna Hold Your Hand is sung by a girl about a girl, Jude draws Lucy's bare breast, Jude is hit on the head pretty bad during the riot scene...

JfactXQiaa	Well you can include the historical context and comment on Blake bieng from the Romanticism era. Furthermore his imagery including animals show his love of nature, and the references of nature can be seen as metaphors, mainly to the industrial revolution. <br>  <br>  The use of "night" is important as time when Blake was alive was very important, and the only way the people could tell the time was from the sun and where it was in the sky, likewise this also helped how the seasons, linking back to nature.<br>  <br>  The use of "stars" can be seen as religious as it links to the 3 wise men, and religion was very important during the Romanticism movement<br>  <br>  The AB rhyming scheme shows the simpleness, and poets helped form a change during this era due to thier uneducated backrounds which closed the gap between the peasants and higher class<br>  <br>  Thats all I can think of, but I hope it helps|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Published in a collection of poems called Songs of Experience in 1794, Blake wrote "The Tyger" during his more radical period. He wrote most of his major works during this time, often railing against oppressive institutions like the church or the monarchy, or any and all cultural traditions – sexist, racist, or classist – which stifled imagination or passion. Blake published an earlier collection of poetry called the Songs of Innocence in 1789. Once Songs of Experience came out five years later, the two were always published together.<br>  <br>  The poems in Songs of Experience, on the other hand, wrestle with issues of what happens when that innocence is lost. "The Tyger" is often paired with the poem called "The Lamb" from Songs of Innocence. The former references the latter and reexamines the themes of "The Lamb" through the lens of experience. <br>  <br>  <br>  From Shmoop/The Tyger

You could take it even further by choosing a type of tree that means something to you personally.  Like if you choose the maple, the maple seed is really distinct and it "flies".

When I picture the tree of life, I see it as having the rays coming through the gaps in the branches.  It sounds like it will look realy great.  I actually thought about getting the same thing done on my arm because I've always been obsessed with that image.  So, I hope it turns out really well... good luck.
6QDaqIXbaa	Back in the old days first editions were all done in different colors as they usually couldn;t find enough good quality material in the same colors to print the amount of books they wanted to therefore they ended up multi colored. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else has a brown one or a yellow one (most common colours for back then,)<br>  Another reason is it the jacket or cover could have been broken and mended differently than the original or it is a fake.

yy0wwNMnaa	Sophie's world by Jostein Gaarder is an introduction in the history of philosophy and in the main ideas, all wrapped-up in a chatching story. it's suited to have you introduced to the main ideas in philosophy and it's easy, nothing too scientific.
HORACAnlaa	I would start with "History of Philosophy" by Frederick Copleston, S.J., and "History of Political Philosophy", edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey. They're harder than you most likely want but they have serious depth to them. Additionally, I would read books by Ayn Rand -- just remember she's not the end of philosophy as her tone sometimes manages to suggest. "History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell is also a good first read; however, it is dated and lacks depth at times. Read "Closing of the American Mind" by Allan Bloom to see a philosophical mind at work examining America in the 1980s. After that try the main texts below:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plato -- The Republic, The Laws<br>  Aristotle -- Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Metaphysics<br>  Thucydides -- The War of the Peloponnesians and the Athenians<br>  St.Augustine -- The City of God<br>  Dante -- The Divine Comedy<br>  Maimonides -- the guide of the Perplexed<br>  St. Aquinas -- Summa Theologica<br>  Machiavelli -- The Prince, The Discourses on the First ten books of Titus Livius<br>  Bacon -- New Atlantis, Advancement of Learning<br>  Descartes -- Discourse on Method, Meditations<br>  Hobbes -- Leviathan<br>  Locke -- Two Treatises of government, An essay concerning Human Understanding<br>  Milton -- Paradise Lost<br>  Shakespeare -- Hamlet, King Lear,<br>  Spinoza -- Theologico-Political Treatise<br>  Hume -- Treatise of Human Understanding, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding<br>  Rousseau -- Social Contract, Discourse on the Sciences and Arts<br>  Smith -- The Wealth of Nations<br>  Burke -- Reflections on the Revolution in France<br>  Kant -- Critique of pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason<br>  Hegel -- Phenomenolgy of the Mind<br>  Marx -- Capital<br>  Nietzsche -- Beyond Good and evil, Thus spoke Zarathustra<br>  Husserl -- Logical Investigations<br>  Heidegger -- Being and Time<br>  Wittgenstein -- Philosophical Investigations<br>  Popper -- The Logic of Scientific Discovery, The open Society and its Enemies|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	Don't listen to Mountain Dweller. He has good intentions but is perhaps a bit over-zealous.<br>  <br>  If you're new to philosophy, it is a very large subject to tackle without a guide. Not to mention many philosophical books and authors are abtruse and impenatrable, such as Wittgenstein, Hegel or even the infamous Nietzche. <br>  <br>  Rather than charge headlong into the straight works of the authors themselves, try a primer first, an introduction to the works. If you don't know where to start, the subject of philosophy can be a daunting task. There are categories, sub-categories, and sub-sub-categories. People have been writing in the vein of philosophy for literally thousands of years and the last 300 years have been uncommonly busy producing dozens of "house-hold" names. <br>  If you start with an introductary book, a guide, it can highlight the main movements, the history of, the ideas, the authors, WITHOUT you getting bogged down in the abtruse logics and proofs of whatever philosopher you happen to pick up. Furthermore it will can give you a basic understanding of the authors' ideas so that when you do pick up their work, you already familiar with them so you don't have to wade through them, asking youself "what the hell is he saying?" In addition, if you're trying to decide whether you should start reading Schopenhauer, Aristotle, Aquinis, Heiddegger, or Kant, you can have an understanding of them enough to say, "I don't like Heiddegger but I'm interested in Kant. I'll check him out."<br>  <br>  Just a suggestion. Check out your local book store or library. There are many, many great introductatory books out there.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	That's like asking if there are any good books with words in them...Philosophy is a HUGE subject....<br>  As for a first one to read?<br>  <br>  Will Durant's intro to Philosophy is pretty good.<br>  <br>  Go to your Public Library and look in the 180-200 range on the shelves...there should be a few to get you started.|`|UROlC7Craa	Marcus Aurelius' "Meditations" is really great, I loved it.|`|zMgDqZjkaa	hm..i like osho writing...

nQ3kFPMVaa	Many puppet makers sell rods separately to their puppets - One Way Street for example. Do a google for puppet rods or people puppets and you'll find a whole bunch of sellers/makers. *However*, I would advise you to be careful. These muppets are very collectible, and you might damage it using a rod that isn't designed to be used with your muppet - the rod that came with it, how is it attached? Can you easily attach another rod? Puppet rods usually work on a 'attach at wrist' basis, by sewing it to the materials, or creating an elastic wrist band, or slotting it into a loop attached to the wrist. As the puppets were so expensive, I'd recommend looking into it first, just in case you damage the puppet and have to spend money on repairs: puppets are designed to be used, and if the rod is incorrectly attached, it can end up ripping the arm from the shoulder or ripping the wrist from the arm.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it too much, but again, it's a matter of being careful and checking the rod will actually work properly. When you go to purchase a rod, be sure to ask the seller for their advice; they'd be able to tell you whether or not their product will work with your puppet. You can also easily commission a puppet maker to make you a new rod *and* modify the puppet for you if the rod doesn't easily attach.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Here is a good link foer you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.puppetuniverse.com/puppet-accessories/puppet-rods/17inhandrodforfullbodypuppet.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppetuniverse.com/puppet-acc...</a><br>  <br>  Also, I believe, E-bay sells them but not sure.

bmi4Xlbfaa	You should definitely read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (author of the Underland Chronicles). Look it up.|`|3a16a10b2d1646576de2efa56252ca50aa	Artemis Fowl is one of my favorite series. I also love the Chronicles of Narnia, and the Inkworld series (even though I think Cornelia Funke could have shortened each book by 100 to 200 pages). I don't know if you've read Harry Potter yet. That may seem like a silly question because everyone's heard of Harry Potter, but my younger kids haven't started reading the books yet. You might be interested in Eragon, but I gave up after reading the second book, because the author goes on for hundreds of pages about nothing, and it's pretty boring. Still, it's a bestseller, so at least some people like it. LOL Lord of the Rings is also very good, even if the writing style is a little dry compared to modern writing styles. Twilight can't hold a candle to any of the above books (I think Eragon is as bad as Twilight). :)

2JOes8EJaa	I think anyone who wants to play drums enough can do it. It's pretty much that way with any instrument (and a lot of other things) - if you're interested and motivated enough to play a lot, you'll pick it up. Especially with a good teacher. If you're not sure that you WANT to, make sure you think about a few things first:<br>  <br>  - Drums are loud. Period. You can mute them, dampen the sound to a certain extent, but they're generally VERY audible even if you're playing lightly. And that's no fun! So: do you have a place where you can practice consistently?<br>  <br>  - Drums take up a bunch of space. Even small kits can only be broken down so far. Do you have the space to set them up and store them? If you plan on playing with other people (most drummers do, I'd say), are you going to be able to transport them?<br>  <br>  - Drums can be kinda expensive. You can start out with a cheaper, used drum set, but even that can set you back $500. There are ongoing expenses to think about, too: sticks, replacing things like cymbals, stands, etc. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong: drums are great. They're uniquely fun and, to me, a really cathartic instrument to play. You can always find people looking for a drummer, if being a band is appealing to you. If you want to play drums, play drums! Just be aware of some of the issues that come along with being a drummer and, if that doesn't scare you off, go for it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Been playing for 22 years and all I can tell you is takes lessons and learn how to read music. If I had of done that when I was young I would be twice the drummer I am now.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Start with the conga , then move on to other drums .

6FSdrlCtaa	that is the prettiest haiku i have ever heard ever. i cried. :'(|`|nE5eqyWeaa	It's not very good and the reason is it doesn't know (or the poet doesn't) what it wants to talk about.|`|sr4BAblpaa	For the person who called this a haiku-it's NOT a haiku...it's a free verse. lol. <br>  <br>  I thought it was very good.  I think it's meaning is clear, in a way-because I have a tendancy to understand poems that are so detailed such as this one.  I'm sure it's about someone remembering the world's history (possibly in the winter at some time...?-according to just the first stanza) and not being able to distinguish the reason for our nation's behavior, and vice versa.  And still, he cannot find a reason for being hypocritical-he wants peace as much as the rest of the world-but know's it will never happen.  <br>  <br>  I could be wrong, too...that's just how I saw the poem.  Again, very nice. (:

But, by then, thousands of innocent people had lost all they owned, never to get it back just because mainland Americans panicked.  It is well to note that nothing like this was done on the Hawaiian island, the "victim" of the attack.  Strange, huh?  We now have the same thing in the infamous Patriot Act, which without question is in violation the U.S. Constitution, just as the relocation was.  Did anyone really react then?  Not many.  Does anyone reaction now to the loss of liberty? Even fewer.  Case closed.|`|gd0oBfOhaa	It was legal since the government approved it.<br>  <br>  It wasn't necessary though.  The entire point of the idea was to move West coast japanese away from the west coast so that they would not aid the Japanese army if they ever invaded.  Also the relocation (Internment Camps) was supposed to keep Japanese Spies from giving away precious information to the Japanese.<br>  <br>  Nowadays the entire Internment camp idea is looked at as a bad thing since most of the interned Japanese were probably not spies, and their rights were revoked when they were forced into camps against their will.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Ugh!  That's a tough one.<br>  <br>  It was considered necessary because after Pearl Harbor, the US thought anyone of Japanese descent might be an enemy, even if they were US citizens.  How can you tell, when they still have connections to their friends and family in the old country, they still speak their native language, and by golly, their skin is a different color?  (Sound somewhat like the "Middle Eastern problem" today?)<br>  <br>  Why was it considered legal?  It should be disturbing to anyone if an American citizen can be imprisoned without a trial.  But here's how they pulled it off.<br>  <br>  FDR issued Executive Order 9066, allowing the military to prohibit people from going to certain areas in order to prevent espionage.  Then anyone of Japanese heritage was supposed to stay out of the West Coast area.  The problem was that they had homes and businesses there.  First they were expected to relocate voluntarily, and when that didn't work, the only recourse was to remove them, at least temporarily.  They weren't going to prisons, they were just "camping" until the war was over and it was okay for them to go home.<br>  <br>  It feels pretty icky to have to stand up and pretend that you support a historical position that we now know was wrong.  The reason for it is so that we have an idea of where these dumb ideas come from, so when similar things happen in our own time, we recognize it and we can avoid doing it.

No sound of her parents getting ready for work, or her brother late for school. Were they punishing her for last night?

Why had her family disappeared.<br>  <br>  Twenty-five years later the mystery is no nearer to being solved and Cynthia is still haunted by unanswered questions. Were her family murdered? Abducted? If so why was she spared? And if they are alive, why did they abandon her?<br>  <br>  Then a letter arives, a letter which makes no sense.

wWzK6eJaaa	The nazis killed anyone who had brown hair and brown eyes, how ironic that hitler had brown hair and brown eyes. If you had blonde hair and blue eyes you were safe, what a tragedy!|`|wnkoTEqVaa	MisBoss your wrong<br>  <br>  They took people that they new or were suspected of being Jewish. Gays and other races were taken an killed. It was nothing about having hair or color eyes. Blonde hair and blue eyes was the ideal Germans but you did not have to have them. As long you were not Jew, Gay or another race you would be fine. <br>  Also remember many German people would rat out their neighbors and friends. Even an accusation would get you thrown into a jail or concentration camp.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, Jewish people would be identifiable by the fact that they attended synagogues, ate kosher food, and followed other traditional Jewish practices.  Even non-religious Jews would probably be known to be Jewish by their connections, they would probably have relatives and friends who followed traditional Jewish practices even if they did not themselves.  Also they might have to identify their religion when filling in medical forms etc.<br>  <br>  I believe homosexuality was not actually illegal in pre-Nazi Germany, so many gay people were probably living openly as gay, so they could be easily targeted by the Nazis.  And even if people were keeping it secret, there would always be those who would know their secret, and who might betray them.<br>  <br>  Other people would be easily identifiable in other ways.  Gypsies for instance usually live with other gypsies and travel in groups, so they would be easy to pick off.  Communists would be known through their party membership. anyone physically or mentally handicapped would be easy to identify.  And Slavs (the second largest number killed next to the Jews), would presumably be identified by the region they came from.  Jehovah's Witnesses (another target group) would be idnetifiable by the fact that they preached their religion openly and were pacifists.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The Nazis relied on people to denounce their neighbors, for one thing.  They punished anyone who was caught helping a Jew or other targeted person, and they rewarded people who turned them in.<br>  <br>  The Nazis also targeted gypsies, the handicapped, the mentally ill and developmentally disabled, the seriously physically ill and elderly, and anyone who protested their policies.<br>  <br>  Not everyone who died in the Holocaust died in concentration camps. People in hospitals and institutions were killed inside those places.  People were also shot in their homes and in the streets.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Jews, Homosexuals, Political dissidents, Gypsies, Slavs, Russian POW's, mentally ill and disabled...all were sent to their deaths in significant numbers. <br>  <br>  In Germany in the 1930's, it wasn't a case of proving someone was Jewish, it was a case of them having to prove that they weren't Jewish. For a large section of the population, that meant producing certificates of baptism going back three generations. All over Germany, Churches were inundated with requests to provide certification of baptism/christening, and to their eternal shame, the church leaders obliged.<br>  <br>  In the Eastern and Balkan states particularly, the Jews were more Orthodox and much easier to spot from their dress, habits and traditions (Orthodox Jews also lived in other parts of Europe too, such as France). In many cases, families were reported to the authorities if they were known to be Jewish. The Nazis also looked for certain facial features they deemed generic to the Jewish people, and if you fell under suspicion, you had to provide your proof of ancestry.<br>  <br>  One of the more disturbing aspects concerning how Jews were gradually rounded up was that in occupied countries, the responsibility to identify and register Jews fell onto local Police forces. As many people were of course completely unaware of the fate that would befall these people, those Police Forces regretfully obliged the ruling Nazi authorities. Even in France and the Channel Islands, this is known to have taken place.|`|8d8Fp8xcaa	people who wernt 'perfect'<br>  so that was<br>  The black race<br>  Jews<br>  Jehovah's witnesses<br>  Soviet POWs <br>  Gypsies<br>  Homosexuals<br>  Political Prisoners<br>  common criminals<br>  Nuns<br>  <br>  and most were obvious like nuns,people that war the star of david,criminals,prisioners<br>  and the rest were caught in the act :)|`|7wkHVaNyaa	You should go to library and get a book on this also Google it.

Also, it had been a tradition for some time for Jews to live close together, even before Nazis forced them into ghettos. <br>  <br>  How did they know who was gay? I don't know. Gays weren't sent to camps in anywhere near the same numbers as any other group, so maybe they were 'caught in the act' on a case-by-case basis. <br>  <br>  They also sent gypsies (easily recognizable by their lifestyles); Nuns (also easily recognizable); and people who had obvious genetic mutations, like autism, Downs, dwarfism, etc.|`|CE4hcUmhaa	Basic profiling.<br>  <br>  The Nazis believed in racial superiority, and had several branches of "science" that characterized the races based mostly upon outward appearance.  That was the primary reason how they "knew", but in a totalitarian state, people were guilty until proved innocent, meaning that the burden of proof to show that you weren't one of the untermenschen was upon yourself.  <br>  <br>  The racial thing didn't happen overnight- the Nazis had been gathering data on the population for years before what we think of the holocaust had occurred.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	pretty much everyone that wasn't what the Nazis thought they should be.  They had eye and hair charts that show the 'proper' hair and eye colors and if yours wasn't one of them you were a jew.  Gay people I guess was more of a witch hunt. If someone said you were too bad for you. There's all kinds of interesting/sad stuff about it at the Holocaust museum.  They even have some of the eye/hair charts.|`|t6N64bBYaa	they kept records from Sinagogs where the Jews worshipped to know who was Jewish and who was not. I never heard about Gay people but if i had to guess on that, i'd say just rumors going around. I know men were normally killed before women and children. Children normally died with their mothers. It sickens me|`|6zdmzdQ2aa	Well, some Jews simply wore the star of David.  Others tried to hide, of course.  But the Nazis were in their communities.  They knew these people, so many of them knew who was Jewish, who has gay, who was mentally handicapped, etc.  They basically killed anyone they didn't like.|`|1iXvphNYaa	That's the kicker.|`|1OujK62Vaa	idk good question

Hitler campaigned on a platform of "Hope and Change" and the populace ate it up.<br>  <br>  A second was the political turmoil Germany was involved with.  The political structure was chaos, with communists, socialists, fascists, democrats, anarchists and even monarchists vying for power.  Hitler was willing to make deals, accommodations, and concessions with all of them to expand his power base until he had the opportunity to consolidate his gains.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The German people felt humiliated after the reparations they were forced to make for World War I, leading to aggressive nationalism.<br>  <br>  They were also in an economic depression in 1930.

kfOpbbCyaa	No, you don't sound crazy, just wonderfully eccentric. I have always appreciated eccentricity. :) It puts me in mind of Henry David Thoreau's Walden: "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away." (Walden might be a bit on the boring side, but I love that quote.)<br>  <br>  Once started, a good series will be gobbled up. My eccentricity comes in the form of putting off starting the series until I'm sure most of the books, if not all, have been written.<br>  <br>  I don't look at finishing books or a series as closure, but an opportunity to read it once again. Reading a beloved story over again is like getting reacquainted with old friends you haven't seen in a while.<br>  <br>  As far as Jane Austen is concerned, I've found I can read them over and over again. But buy or borrow an unabridged copy of Pride and Prejudice - you don't know what you are missing by being limited to an abridged copy. (This is, of course, my opinion, but I hate, loathe, despise and abominate abridged books. I think it must have been a TV producer - or someone on that order who would prefer we watch movies and TV rather than reading - who came up with the concept of abbreviating books.) Right now I'm reading Pride and Prejudice for the umpteenth time...and loving it just as much as ever.<br>  <br>  All this to say you should "step to the music" you hear without regard to what anyone else thinks. It's not crazy, it's being uniquely yourself. That's a good thing.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I did that with the Harry Potter series, too! I waited 2 months then finally couldn't take it anymore and read it in 5 hours. (Let me just tell you  it was my favorite!) But yes, a lot of people feel like the ending of their favorite series is the ending of a part of their lives. I felt that way with The Lord of the Rings. You're not crazy, don't worry :)|`|M0bE2IBQaa	I hate it when a series comes to an end. Closure is the worst, and best, part in a series. <br>  <br>  After I finished reading the Deathly Hallows, I had left a huge time gap between finishing that book and starting The Tales of Beedle the Bard. When I bought this book a few months ago, I started reading it and almost forgot what the Deathly Hallows was about. I felt so bad. So I ended up rereading the Deathly Hallows and then I read the Tales of Beedle the Bard. <br>  <br>  ...but to be honest with you, I haven't really finished the Tales of Beedle the Bard....(I'm not sure if I want to, lol). I am not saying that it's a bad book, it's a great book. I just don't want this whole series to end. I've only read 25 pages out of the 111 that were published, lol. But who knows, I may start reading it again, and I may end up finishing it this time.  You are not alone, and by the way I want a grand piano too!|`|bLnjJ6Cbaa	Sorry, Lyra, but you're just crazy! :)<br>  <br>  Okay, okay, I'm kidding! But I don't put off reading the last book of a good series, as far as I can remember. The feeling that "This is the end" wears off after reading the last book or the entire series a few times through. You know what I did before I was able to read Deathly Hallows? (we were 147 on the wait list for it at the library!) I read books one through six, then six through one, then three again. It was very entertaining. When I finally got DH, and finished it at 4 am, I was a bit sad that the series had ended, but that wore off when I remembered I could read it again and again and again and never get tired of it!<br>  <br>  I -do- put off reading the good parts of a book, though. Like the endings or the action parts. If I get to the end of a page, or chapter or book I cover the bottom of the page with my hand so that I don't read ahead and spoil it for myself. Sometimes I'll put a book away for a few hours before returning to it, if I've gotten to a great part.<br>  <br>  But I don't put off reading the final book in a series :)|`|SYKGIiQkaa	It honestly depends if the series is out yet. For example, I read the Harry Potter series from start to finish as the books came out. (Which means I was very young when the first one came out and graduating high school when the last one was released.) Therefore the anticipation made me want to read them.<br>  <br>  On the other hand I read Magic's Pawn and Magic's Promise by Mercedes Lackey but never did read Magic's Price because I knew the main character would die.|`|2z5yV9Jraa	i hate it when i get up to the last book in a series, but i cant help myself to read it anyway. I remember when i was reading 'His Dark Materials' series (best books EVERR) and i finally reached the Amber Spyglass, and as soon as i turned the last page it felt like a close friend died. I am the worst with things like this, and i felt the exact same way with the Harry Potter series. So, YOURE NOT ALONE|`|t6N64bBYaa	You have got to read the Deathly Hollows!!! it is the best book in the entire series. you are missing out on a whole lot of Harry Potter goodness if you don't. Thing about closer is that sometimes you won't like the ending, but hey at least you'll know what happens to those characters you love|`|H1OpsNCPaa	I do the same, and I'm sure many other people do too.<br>  In one way I'm excited to know what happens, but I don't want the series to end because in a strange way I become attached to the characters and settings. That's just me though, I get really absorbed in my books :')<br>  xxx|`|LgC2oA77aa	put off reading? only if it is boring, i'm not afraid of anything in books<br>  <br>  it's not a crazy thing, you love that book and you don't want to close it for a long time, you want to keep it open and stay young instead of growing up with the closure<br>  <br>  ok, don't worry, you're reading so much... <br>  <br>  bye|`|GyPNO47gaa	It's not crazy - I bet loads of people do that. I personally can't wait to read the books and get annoyed by waiting for them to be published!!<br>  <br>  I suggest you read them :)|`|1YV3e1ZEaa	I don't really tend to read many series. But, I do it with authors in general. Or I take my time getting through a specific book.<br>  <br>  It by Stephen King. I could have read that book in one sitting, it was so great. But, I read unusually slow for myself... just so I didn't have to give up the book.<br>  <br>  Also, when I read Angels and Demons when it first came out, it sent me into this Dan Brown spiral. I had to read all of his books. When I had finished The DaVinci Code and Digital Fortress, I took my precious time with Deception Point. It's a, what, 500 page book? And I think I dragged it out for two weeks.<br>  <br>  Then there's my favorite author, Chuck Palahniuk. I had already read all his books, more than once, and was waiting desperately for a new one to come out. He released Snuff last May, and I have still yet to pick it up. I don't want to read that and then have to wait however long until I can get another Palahniuk book. It's just too hard.<br>  <br>  That was a great question.|`|tL73W0VZaa	Well, I don't do that. However, because I'm a speed reader, and I tend to finish books far too fast, I get up in the middle of the climax, and make myself tea or something, just because I want to savor the excitement. It's so sad knowing that a book you really like is nearly over.<br>  <br>  By the way, you don't need to hold off on Mansfield Park. In addition to the unabridged version of Pride and Prejudice, there are three more books by Austen: Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey, plus a very short, funny novel called Lady Susan.|`|Km2N5BLwaa	haha ni your not crazy.<br>  <br>  Im reading the Twilight sega and I'm on the last book, I have about a few chapters left, but I keep putting off reading them because I don't want the story to end.<br>  Your not the only one. :]|`|MSEyXHFWaa	You sound crazy to me too.<br>  <br>  I try to get to the last book ASAP. Like I'm going to wait to find out what happens. I was outside Chapters at midnight when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out. <br>  <br>  When books get good, though, I do tend to put them down and walk around for a bit instead of speeding through them. Just to savour the moment. :P<br>  <br>  Sometimes you don't want the series to end, but I don't think that reading the ending will make the series any more final; you can still re-read them (as I did with Harry Potter) and there're always more good series just waiting to be read.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine purposely not reading a good book.<br>  <br>  But that's just me.|`|j7D3Sazraa	I do the same thing. Like, I'm putting off reading the Vampire Academy books that are out because I'll get too impatient to wait for the others to get published.
AA11564934	It probably can't at least in our current physics|`|C8Djjxqkaa	It can be abstract. The mathematical concept of a sinusoid,  for example, has existed since t=-infinity..|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Your question is very difficult to find possible for every thing we experience has a begining and an end.<br>  <br>  No thing is new to God, and no cosmic event ever comes as a surprise; he inhabits the circle of eternity. He is without beginning or end of days. To God there is no past, present, or future; all time is present at any given moment. He is the great and only I AM. Page 34-4<br>  <br>  It is only man's distance from infinity that causes this concept to be expressed as one word. While infinity is on the one hand UNITY, on the other it is DIVERSITY without end or limit. Infinity, as it is observed by finite intelligences, is the maximum paradox of creature philosophy and finite metaphysics. Though man's spiritual nature reaches up in the worship experience to the Father who is infinite, man's intellectual comprehension capacity is exhausted by the maximum conception of the Supreme Being. Beyond the Supreme, concepts are increasingly names; less and less are they true designations of reality; more and more do they become the creature's projection of finite understanding toward the superfinite. Page 1262-1|`|8YVo2Wogaa	We think of things in particular ways. Like time with the past behind and the future in front.<br>  <br>  And cause and effect.<br>  <br>  And beginnings and endings.<br>  <br>  It is just the way we think about things. It doesn't mean they are like that.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	All things cannot do that.<br>  <br>  Only God is.|`|VcIg1R1zaa	if it has no end either|`|wxSO48E3aa	I don't think that there is any physical thing in existence that had no beginning.<br>  <br>  I think we would have to take time out of the equasion, which is man made.<br>  <br>  If time doesn't exist then the beginning of time didn't happen.  So there would be nothing to measure against when something came into existence.<br>  <br>  Like an infinity of timelessness.<br>  <br>  So logically, timelessness exists because in reality time doesn't.  And timelessness had no beginning.|`|yUudoO1Raa	How can something exist that CAME from nothing? [that theory is called ex nihilo]<br>  <br>  Do not think of "nothingness" as the default position of the universe. If "nothingness" was at one time the state of existence, then all of our logic, all our science, and yes even our religions are false because God cannot exist outside of existence. Nothing can or language means nothing. If God existed, then that was the beginning.<br>  <br>  However, here is the metaphysical theory of "somethingness" as the default position:<br>  "Existence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernatural dimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence, nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and only existence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable."<br>  <br>   Leonard Peikoff “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,”<br>  Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 148|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't exist. How presumptuous; you weren't created to fathom everything in the universe, only what you need to survive in a savanna or forest.|`|KqwloDo7aa	Apparently, you have yet to encounter the curious properties of a Mobius strip....<br>  <br>  Think about it...<br>  <br>  See Wikipedia reference and enjoy....<br>  <br>  Orin|`|6nVDPBVsaa	Well if something exists i'm sure it's begun already.

Were you ever not here now? There's no escape, none.|`|ufdFei1jaa	Time.|`|AA11370093	Hi, Rainbow!<br>  <br>  Existence, with respect to your question, has but two logical options:<br>  <br>  1)  Something eternally exists.<br>  2)  There was a point of nonexistence.<br>  <br>  Although my existence is not logically inescapable, it is logically undeniable.  Since I necessarily contradict myself in the act of denial (for non-existence does not deny existence), we may start with a point of certainty -- something does exist.<br>  <br>  In order for there to be a point of non-existence (nothingness), "something" must fit into one of three categories (these are logically exhaustive):<br>  <br>  a)  Illusion.<br>  b)  Self-caused.<br>  c)  From nothing.<br>  <br>  Something cannot be an illusion since it is undeniable that something exists.  In addition, what is producing the illusion?  Who or what is observing the illusion (since observation necessitates something cognitive)?  We may confidently dispense with option a.<br>  <br>  Something cannot be self-caused since it would have to exist prior to itself in order to cause its own existence -- a logical contradiction.  Scratch this option.<br>  <br>  What is "nothing" but no thing?  By nothing we mean non-existence, or a complete lack of attributes:  no color, no shape, no size, no substance whatsoever -- no attributes at all.  If something comes from nothing, 'something' must have at least the attribute of being able to have something come from it.  If nothingness possesses ANY property or ANY attribute, it is no longer nothing but something.  One must equivocate in order to argue that "nothing" possesses the attribute that something can come from it.  Nothing can possess NO attributes.<br>  <br>  If ever there were a point of non-existence, something would either be self-caused or it would have to come from nothing.  To be self-caused is impossible and something cannot come from nothing.  There is something now, therefore, something eternally exists.  <br>  <br>  As you can see, the conclusion is derived by logically unpacking each step.  If you would like to discuss this further, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  Scalia|`|Pb62L3MYaa	why can't it? its just our experience in this world that has led us to believe things have a beginning and an end , and usually its manmade things that have lead us to believe this - including humans!<br>  its humans that have created time, so technically everything before humans has 'always' been there|`|At81Eu6Aaa	you mean the universe right...well my cousin told me that there has always had to beens oemthing out theere which is why some scientists  ebleive that there is a God.. not necessarily human but with the conciesnce of equality and wut is wrong and wut needs to happeen in order to function... humans didnt have tio be the primary form of life....could of been talkiing parrots or soemthing..but we were distined in this life to be primary.. maybe before the big bang ..it was something else... but somehting has to always be there and will never be gone|`|ehUrxExbaa	I think the mobius strip has a beginning.

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	The only difference between a character and a human is that a character isn't real. But characters are based off of humans, and therefore should be the same as humans and have strengths, weaknesses, faults, and certain perfections. They should have clear-cut personalities, whether they're "mysterious" or not (the personality needs to come out some time). That sort of thing.<br>  <br>  There are Mary Sue litmus tests on the web. Here are a few different ones:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html" rel="nofollow">http://katfeete.net/writing/marysue.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.springhole.net/quizzes/marysue.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.springhole.net/quizzes/marysu...</a><br>  <br>  If you google them, you can find some more. Then, you can better determine how to make your characters less Mary Sue/Gary Stu-ish. Hope this helped.

He'll probably have eyes that manage to be hazel, purple and amethyst all at once, and hair like 'sea spray' or something. And he'll be incredibly strong, and capable of walking around on land whenever he wants. He'll go to high school, (because that makes perfect sense) and drive an incredibly expensive car, because he is filthy rich for some unfathomable reason.

It reminds me of growing up watching Dukes of Hazzard.|`|HXgeesBqaa	I am very torn on this issue and have debated internally for several years.<br>  <br>  On one hand there is that pride of ancestry and independence reflected in the flag. That is our history and shows the lengths southerners would go to to protect their way of life from outside influence. In days gone by before it  was politically incorrect to play, the strains of "Dixie" would bring tears to my eyes as I listened to those proud lyrics. There was no hate involved, just a deep regional pride. That however is the view of a white, male Southerner and the oral and written history that I grew up with.<br>  <br>  On the other hand  the flag has, over the years, been hijacked by hate groups, (KKK, Aryan Nation, etc) and has become a symbol of hate and racial intolerance. It brings out the worst in people on both sides of the flag debate. At least I think I can understand the view of an African-American that sees nothing but a reminder of a history of discrimination that still hasn't been completely overcome. I completely understand how that would make the flag offensive.<br>  <br>  Of course we're talking about the Confederate battle flag (or more accurately for the truly historically aware, the 2nd Naval Jack) and it's instantly identifiable white-starred, blue St Andrews cross on the red background.  Whenever I see  a version of the 'Bonnie Blue" or the "Stars and Bars" original flags I don't feel that indecision about the flags of my forefathers as they don't raise that specter of hate to me, just the history of my family.|`|74f8e743f8a3465fff1898d42967fe25aa	I could take the stance of someone who says that it's a sign of slavery and all of that, but I won't.<br>  <br>  The flag is a sign of some of the darkest moments in this nation's history.

The usually like to have sex with politicians an have there baby's. They raise their children to go into politics just like there fathers  not that they can own up to who there parents are. There was a famous witch who became a prime minister during the 70's an she lasted a fair time until she was stabbed in the back by other followers who wanted power.

Basically the people were incredibly poor and their environmental problems would have kept them from doing anything about it.  The TVA came in and started improving the land and making the river navigable.<br>  <br>  The TVA helped people in the area by lifting them out of chronic poverty.

0LgpcOBDaa	1) What first inspired you to become a photographer?<br>  - Watching my dad develop BW film back in the 50's in the basement on top of the washer n dryer under a red light.<br>  <br>  2) What kind of photographer are you?<br>  - It's a generic term called - freelance - I am just a camera and a brain behind the camera, for hire.<br>  <br>  3) How many hours do you put in a week on average?<br>  - It can be as few as just 2 or 3 or as many 40 or more. Just depends on how often the phone rings or e-mail comes in. There is also the fact I hang at a few Tucson Art Galleries and the shows switch out every 60 days. I am already working on the next show for April.<br>  <br>  4) Which camera system do you use?<br>  - Mostly D-SLR's based on the Nikon F mount system. I shoot Fuji Pro cameras built on donner Nikon bodies. (I shoot with their older S-2 (excellent colors) a S-3 that is factory modified to see in infrared and ultraviolet light when used with the proper filters, and then their latest model, the S-5. Also fantastic colors and beautiful skin tones).  This way I can use all my acquired Nikon lenses and accessories from the film daze.. However, a lot depends on the effect I want and the depth I want to get into it. I also use 4x5 cameras. Sometimes for 'fun' I will break out the 120 year old 8x10 camera and shoot paper negs.<br>  <br>  5) What is the most rewarding part of this profession?<br>  - Making people happy when either viewing my images on a wall somewhere, them buying my images and most of all, doing work for them that they adore and marvel over. Of course the $$ can be mighty good at times too...<br>  <br>  6) What is the biggest downside to this profession?<br>  - Work.. Kinda.. You have to push your self. There is no time clock you punch. You can't put your 40 hours in and then say good, I'm done, time to go home. You are your own boss and many times 'work' (and it's one of them 4 letter words) get's in the way of "other things" you, family or friends would rather be doing. But then, read # 5 again..<br>  <br>  7) How much money is about right to spend on equipment when first starting out?<br>  - If you do your homework right on what name brand equipment you buy I would have to say - as much as you could afford..! Why buy expensive equipment  twice..? Buy good the 1st time and grow into it, not out of it..!<br>  <br>  8) What is a good way to get started in this profession?<br>  - Learn as much as you can about light, shutter speeds, f/stops and ASA - ISO - and how they ALL have to work together, in YOUR head to make it work on paper. You can "photo shop" only so much. It takes too much time. Do as much IN the camera as you can. Learn and understand what a light meter is 'trying' to tell you. Key word here - trying - because hardly is the light meter "right on" for what you want when your shooting for serious effects. Learn and under the 18% gray thing... When your family and friends start saying - you need to go out and do this, or you need to submit work to this gallery or that magazine, then it's time to do it. We are sometimes our worse enemy and worse critic and we sometimes judge our selves too harshly on our own work. Listen to them who say, dang, that's good.. Remember, if you say you can't to it........ your right..!<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|p7q7Ampoaa	What is photography? A freeze frame, an image painted on paper, no, it's an great way to create history. There are many pictures. Family pictures, team pictures, and picture that changed history. Some of these famousnpictures are the flagraising picture on iwojima, the atomic bomb picture on Hiroshima,but if u compare all of these pictures, they are neither differet or special. They are all specifing different things.all pictures has the same purpose. To remember u about that one frame of life which u lived through. <br>  it might weird since I just wrote my thought|`|SR0J6Gfraa	1. I have always enjoyed taking pictures since i was a little girl. there is just so much beauty in it.<br>  2. I'm a kids photographer so i take pictures of infants and toddlers in a studio.<br>  3. i usually put in about 43 hours a week but it varies depending on how in love with your work and how dedicated you are.<br>  4. i use nikon camera's they take really good pictures.<br>  5. its really rewarding when you have people tell you that they love the picture and that its great work. its also rewarding taking a picture of a baby that is crying but yet you turn it into a great picture.<br>  6. i really dont think there is a downside in my opinion.<br>  7. it depends on how dedicated you are on how much money is good for started on your equipment.<br>  8. a good way to get started is to take a photography class in college or to apply for a job and a local studio.|`|i5OVORXgaa	1. I was inspired by the work of Anne Geddes<br>  <br>  2. Portrait Photographer<br>  <br>  3. Since I'm still working on finishing up my degree, I have less hours than most... I usually have between 1-3 paid sessions a month, depending on how busy I  am at school. In one session, I put in 1-2 hours of work.<br>  <br>  4. Currently using the Canon Rebel XTi... soon to be Canon 5D Mark II.<br>  <br>  5. First of all, creating memories... second, I love working with children :)<br>  <br>  6. There's too many people out there that think that just because they own a camera that makes them a professional photographer... they'd rather spend a couple hundred on a camera than on a pro photographer.<br>  <br>  7. It all really depends on what type of photography you plan on going into. Just spend what is necessary... don't go overboard. Slowly build your business. Since I do portraiture on location, all I need is a decent camera, the right lens, a flash, a reflector, and a tripod. All this probably cost me around $2000.<br>  <br>  8. Again, that depends on what kind of photographer you want to be. For me, I started with people I knew... it then spread to people they knew... and so on. Word of mouth really works!|`|2TLXfQKDaa	1) When I was a little boy I wanted to capture images of my toys and keep them with me when I could have the toy along.  This led to me eventually getting my first camera a 110mm the long kodak one that had like 3 buttons on it.  I wish I still had that camera *sigh*<br>  <br>  2) I'm a hobbyist.  My photography ranges from events to nature.  I tend to focus more on nature, but my skills aren't limited to nature.<br>  <br>  3) Twenty hours over the week, about 2-3 per day, sometimes longer on one or two of the days during the week.<br>  <br>  4) Sony DSC-P73 (my point and shoot) <--- secondary<br>      Nikon D40 (my first digital SLR) <--- my primary<br>      I gave my father back his 35mm Nikon SLR that I used in my<br>      earlier years of photography. I don't recall the model it was a <br>      camera from the mid 80s.<br>  <br>  5) Looking at the finished product and having the exact same emotions run through me that I felt while I was capturing the picture.  Nothing really beats that for me, next would be Ooh's and Ahh's of friends and relatives, especially the photographically inclined ones.<br>  <br>  6) The initial cost of building up your equipment, that's pretty much it for me.<br>  <br>  7) It really depends on the photographer and what they plan on shooting.  Many can do fine and are happy with a kit lens and a lens with the next step up in zoom. 18-55 and 55-200.  This won't run you more than 600 dollars on entry level cameras which is a pretty large chunk of cash, but way way way cheaper than the photographer that needs the expensive high end cameras and glass.<br>  <br>  8) Take a lot of pictures and be mindful of everything in the shot, EVERYTHING.  Sometimes it's tough to get two shots of a fleeting moment, but try not to do anything by accident.  I heard this once before and it really rings true for me, "If you can't replicate the shot twice or more, then it was just a lucky shot."  Obviously you're not going to command a rainbow to appear in the gorgeous roygbiv vibgyor pattern over the perfect cap in a mountain inlet, but if you're just a lucky photographer, you're not really learning, unless you can make it happen more than once.

7uCfW237aa	As long as they dont mind flash photography during the ceremony, i would recommend you bounce your flash off the ceiling at full power.<br>  <br>  You should use your camera with a shutter speed of around 1/8, the aperture between 2.8 and 8 depending on the light, and the ISO number as low as possible. Be inventive in the way you use your flashgun! And maybe try a softener?<br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11970662	Did you use the flash? If so, your ISO is probably just way too high.<br>  <br>  Either way, do some tests in the venue and use the lowest possible ISO that will allow the photos to show up. Try to get 800 if you can. You'll definitely need to use the 3.5 aperture. Also use the shutter-speed shake rule--if your focal length is 18, use 1/36 second shutter (which would be closest to 1/50 or so.) That way you're only using the minimum speed that you need, allowing more light in.

SygvUa0Eaa	To be completely honest, spending a whole day revolving around your 'book' isn't exactly the best idea. Planning ahead of time when your going to write, just isn't a good idea in the first place. When you have a specific time dedicated to your writing, you're practically choking your mind of creativity, ultimately giving you writer's block. You need to relax, and (going guru on you!) 'let the time, come to you'. Not kidding though; you have to have a certain surge(?) of imagination, or the will to write. It'll be much easier for your ideas to flow through you, rather than draining them out. Rather than saying, "I'm going to spend the whole day tomorrow on my book.", say, "I'll see if I feel like writing tomorrow. If not, then later."<br>  <br>  Okay, enough of that little rant! Next: Plot. You cannot begin a book without a plot! It's almost impossible. If you don't know what you're writing about, how can you write it? It just doesn't make sense. Outline it. First off, what's the problem? What's the protagonist's main goal? What's the antagonist's main goal?<br>  <br>  Then, characters. WHO is the protagonist? WHO is the antagonist? Does the protagonist have friends? List them, and name them. Family? List and name. Same goes for the antagonist.<br>  <br>  Next, what is their purpose? You can't have secondary characters, just for them to be there. They have to have some slight significance in the story. Does that protagonist fall in love with someone? Does his/her friend get killed? Yadda yadda.<br>  <br>  Then other unimportant characters don't have to have any importance to the story at all. They can be there in order to fill in some blank spots (paper-boy, neighbor, mailman, etc).<br>  <br>  Now, you need to give them characteristics. What are they like? How do they react to certain events? Etc, etc.<br>  <br>  Okay, you can move on to setting now. When does it take place? The future? Present? Past? Now, WHERE does it take place? <br>  <br>  Next stop: Revision. Before you even begin to write, this step is necessary! You need to think about it from the reader's perspective. You should be thinking, "If I read the discription of my story, would I like the topic?". Who's going to like the book, when you don't? If you don't like what you're writing about, your writing can come out crappy (parden my French). <br>  <br>  Finally, begin to write. However, as I said in the beginning, write it in moderation. You don't want to become overwhelmed in the constant struggle to meet your own goals; otherwise, it'll become pointless and boring. Writing is a passion! Don't write it because you need to. Write it because you want to.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hope I helped!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, feel free to email me if you have any questions, or need any more help. ( nairb311@yahoo.com )|`|Zy0WJCNWaa	Writing should be something you do every day because you are passionate about it. If you are serious about writing a book for publication, work on your technical skills as well as your story-telling abilities. Grammar, punctuation, spelling - all important enough to get your manuscript rejected if they're not flawless (or close to it). Keep in mind that adverbs and adjectives should be used sparingly. Get some reference books on point-of-view, scene setting, dialogue - anything that can enhance your writing. View each day's work as a learning experience as well as a writing one. Do research on anything in your story that you don't have firsthand experience with. (You can google just about anything!) I have two books coming out in the fall - one takes place in Texas in the nineteenth century; I googled all about the trees, flowers, plants, etc. that live(d) in the area where my story took place. Things like that give your story a feel of authenticity. I hope you enjoy the whole process of writing - take your time and make it your best effort. Good luck!|`|dYA8AerXaa	Don't go so fast. Plan the entire story before you write anything, and you're far more likely to complete an entire book. Write just to see where it goes, and your are more likely not to complete it than to complete it. (That's a fine approach for shorter works.)<br>  <br>  When you write that first draft, give yourself permission to write crap. All books go through many drafts, and it's better to get the whole story down, but badly, than to hold back or proceed slowly because it has to be a certain quality. <br>  <br>  Nobody says you have to share your first draft with anybody.|`|RgxXQwwfaa	A professor of mine told me to write what you know. Which was actually very helpful when doing creative writing. Another thing you might want to try is free flow writing, it's a method of writing where you just write your story or chapter and don' t reread it until you've finished it. I think that has helped to improve my writing.<br>  Good luck with your book.|`|NIBtjdvGaa	well remember to be descrptive and not to rush the storyline and you should be fine. hope this helps :D|`|HkXYGAOdaa	-Come up with a central idea which is interesting enough to build a story around; one which will hold the attention of the reader.<br>  -Develop your characters accordingly.<br>  -Be sure to make the first paragraph or page interesting enough for the reader to want to continue reading.

One that I like is rosedog.com. Here other poets, general readers, and even agents and editors can see your work and contact you.

Se puede ser disciplinado en algunas cosas y por el contrario en otras no. Cuando hablamos de disciplina ciega, estamos hablando una actitud autista e irracional, lo cual no es bueno para nadie.<br>  Un disciplinado, es básicamente un "obediente incondicional" a una acción ordenada o dictada. <br>  Las disciplinas, son actividades codificadas y rese?adas que se agrupan por objeto. Si el objeto es el deporte, las disciplinas son deportivas y dentro de estas existen distintas competiciones que requieren reglas o códigos para que exista competencia equitativa.<br>  <br>  Como podrás observar, no siempre la disciplina es garantía de lograr una mejor vida. Muchas veces el ordenamiento disciplinario atenta contra la razón individual y la identidad del individuo. Por ejemplo la disciplina militar. En otras, la disciplina corrige conductas erráticas y se convierte en disciplina formativa, en otras surge la necesidad de acatamiento por propio interés, como la disciplina educativa.|`|084d3685bb150eda4fbfafb2ffe74a73aa	SI, ES UNA REALIDAD COMO LAS LEYES DE LA GRAVEDAD Y OTRAS, SI SOMOS DISCIPLINADOS EN LA ALIMENTACION, TENEMOS MEJOR CALIDAD DE VIDA, MEJOR SALUD, MAS LARGA VIDA, Y SI SOMOS DISCIPLINADOS EN OTROS ASPECTOS TAMBIEN OBTENDREMOS BENEFICIOS, RECORDANDO SIEMPRE QUE DISCIPLINAR SIGNIFICA INSTRUIR, SI SOMOS INSTRUIDOS, SIEMPRE NUESTRA VIDA SERA MEJOR, TOMAREMOS LAS MEJORES DECISIONES, TENDREMOS LAS MEJORES RELACIONES HUMANAS ETC|`|0dedc223281e53a28ec30c407de1e31baa	es como todo   , sin embargo la gente disciplinada tiene mahyores beneficios|`|p5R9gHoraa	No siempre, tuve un profesor muy disciplinado que era de Educación Física, y fue un gran deportista por su diciplina, pero termino la vejez solo, viejo y enfermo, y murió sin que nadie lo  apoyara.

SdtyS4N6aa	Nació en las afueras de Florencia, en la peque?a localidad de Anchiano en 1452, aunque para otros nació en Vinci, de ahí su "apellido", antes de que se adoptaran las convenciones de nombres actualmente vigentes en Europa, por lo que a su nombre de pila se a?adió el de su padre (Ser Piero) y la localidad de nacimiento siendo entonces "Leonardo di Ser Piero da Vinci". Sin embargo, Leonardo acostumbraba firmar sus trabajos como Leonardo o Io, Leonardo (yo Leonardo), es decir, sin emplear el nombre de su padre, lo que induce a pensar que era hijo ilegítimo. Desde ni?o mostró aptitudes para las artes plásticas, principalmente el dibujo. Poseía una gran capacidad de observación lo que le valió no sólo a su obra artística sino también a otros temas que estudió como la física (principalmente la mecánica) la música o el naturalismo (ahora biología), un gran realismo y naturalidad.|`|f05ac044ef525cda9da435e5d8a823c0aa	Leonardo Da Vinci nació en el a?o 1452, un 15 de abril en Archiano, Italia.<br>  <br>  Saludos.

AA11199619	I like, it, but you should polish some of the punctuation and spelling (i.e. use God instead of god). It sounds sincere and honest. Nevertheless, consider if your teacher would like you to:<br>  <br>  a) take a role as one of the passengers or crew. If you were a 1st or 2nd class pasenger, you probably were traveling as a tourist and wanted to state to your family that escaped in a boat that you died as a gentleman; if you were 3rd and under, you probably were a poor peasant migrating to the USA and you felt imperative to let them known what happened to you. If you were a member of the crew, you could expand on the disillusion of finding the leadership did not do their homework on putting life boats and even dressing as a woman to escape, but that you and your colleagues went down with honor and dignity.<br>  <br>  b) Describe something personal of what is happening around you, like the last song of the band, the way waiter helped until the end, etc.  <br>  <br>  To me, that would indicate someone took time to learn more of the passenger and would win extra credit.|`|AA10159919	This was the last bottle of beer consumed by a passenger on the Titanic.

Si en una película intercalan un fotograma con una marca de bebida, no vas a registrarla pero entrará por tu retina; al salir de la sala querrás beber dicha bebida. ,Está prohibida, pero es permitida cuando en un film hay que "poner en clima" al espectador, por ejemplo: antes de la escena de un crimen, intercalan un fotograma con una calavera con dos tibias; eso te prepara inconscientemente para lo que luego vendrá y sentirás más el miedo, el suspenso.|`|bd16d9ad90b66d744c383cceb847e70baa	Hola Flaquis mira yo creo que eso es puro truco publicitario y que nuestros oídos escuchan lo que nosotros queremos.|`|0197b242360881a8507be73774de0435aa	Claro que existen, solo date cuenta de cuantas cosas has comprado sin realmente que sean una necesidad básica, por ejemplo los productos para adelgazar o quitar las imperfecciones de la cara, etc. La publicidad hace bien su trabajo ?no?|`|0a25f95af30b591e3f7ee5b8deeaa76caa	si....|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	YA NO TE AMO<br>  ...Mentiria diciendote k,<br>  k todavia t kiero kmo siempre t kise,<br>  tengo la certeza<br>  k nada fue en vano,<br>  siento dentro de mi k,<br>  tu nosignifikas nada....<br>  no podria decir jamas k,<br>  alimento un gran amor,<br>  siento kada vez mas k.....<br>  ---YA TE OLVIDE----<br>  y jamas usare la frase....<br>  ---YO TE AMO-----<br>  lo siento ... pero debo decir la vda...<br>  <br>  (AHORA LEELO DE ABAJO PARA ARRIBA****)<br>  <br>  y tu desides si existen o no...........|`|83e1659f30888b0870c7b3e4da836fbdaa	si existen y aun son usados, antiguamente como no se sabia mucho del tema se llego a considerar peligroso, pero en realidad no lo son, tampoco te hipnotizan ni van a hacer que andes como zombie pidiendo algun producto, de hecho es casi lo mismo que un comercial, si realmente sientes la necesidad... le vas a hacer caso y sino, solo se deja pasar... a veces cuando el bombardeo subliminal es demasiado el cuerpo tiene un "basurero" que se vacía en el momento que sue?as, es por eso que a veces tienes sue?os tomando una bebida de cierta marca o manejando cierto auto, etc.<br>  <br>  la idea del mensaje subliminal es provocar mayor pregnancia en la marca o producto, o producir sentimientos (muy basicos) en el espectador... por ejemplo en el aro (the ring) se usan mucho, en el club de la pelea (fight club ) tambien se usaron, hay muchas tecnicas para recordar las marcas y los mensajes subliminales es una mas, mira todos los comerciales... la mayoria de ellos van a repetir el nombre de su producto 3 veces o mas ... no es casualidad... piensa en cuantas veces al mes ves el comercial y multiplicalo por las veces en que el nombre del producto sale... con el numero que te resulte.. dificilmente vas a poder sacarte la marca de la cabeza, para que un producto salga al mercado... todo es valido... y hay muchisimas formas, una de ellas es el mensaje subliminal... pero te repito si el producto no te agrada o no te interesa, el mensaje no sirve de nada.<br>  <br>  salu2!|`|8f20e7cf79c5e5ad029419f89cc4c942aa	claro que existen, xq crees que existe la psicologia.....que no a todos les llegue es una cosa...pero de que existen claro...todo producto tiene mensaje subliminal...|`|9b9092d7674010d8e74228ad9398658aaa	Hola.

Una prueba, creo que la más famosa que se hizo con respecto a los mensajes subliminales, fue en una función de cine, donde por cada 23 cuadros de película (para ver una imagen en pantalla con movimiento, hacen falta 24 cuadros seguidos) ponían una de Coca-Cola, y aunque el ojo humano no era capaz de registrarlo, el incociente lo retuvo en la mente, haciendo que uno desee tomar la gaseosa. Y lo que se supo es que después de la función, la venta de Coca-Cola en el hall del cine aumentó mucho más con respecto a lo que se consumía en una función "normal", sin mensajes subliminales.<br>  Según mi profesor de H. de Gestión, hay hasta melodías que son subliminales, y son aquellas que uno dice "uy, se me pegó tal canción que es horrible, pero no puedo dejar de cantarla". Como así también imágenes que nos quedan en la mente mucho más que otras.

I love those books. I first read Twilight last fall soon after it came out. I couldn't forget it. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel all year. And when it finally came out I was so excited. I rarely buy books, but for Stephenie Meyer I make an exception. I didn't want to have to wait months for it at the library! Stephenie Meyer is such a great writer. And one thing I love about her website--and it's an extensive one--is that she has music playlists for both novels so you can get even further into the character's minds. I wish more authors would do that!|`|AA10211094	Someone asked the same question about five minutes ago.  Yes, I've read them both and couldn't put them down.  I loved Bella's character because she's so strong yet feels so many emotions, and Meyers writes in a way in which you feel like you're a part of Bella's life.  I know what you mean about replaying scenes in your head- they're the kind of books that just stay with you for a long time, and you find yourself wondering what the characters are up to!|`|547d42e2e2fe118521926642b008f9b2aa	OH MY GOSH!!!!! i absolutely looooooove that book. the childrens librarian at my local library is a friend and she recommened it and i finally read it.

Voilà une curieuse question! Ce n'est pas le fait d'une personne ou même d'un groupe de personnes. C'est<br>  la résultante des efforts d'une communauté assez large, une ville<br>  au moins, comme dans le cas d'Athènes ou de Sparte, qui par sa richesse matérielle, sa force militaire et aussi (et peut-être même surtout) le rayonnement de son organisation politique et de sa culture, s'est imposée en son temps et a même laissé des<br>  traces pour les civilisations ultérieures. Ainsi de la culture gréco-latine qui a marqué notre partie du monde.<br>  Mais, selon le mot de Paul Valéry, "nous civilisations savons que nous sommes mortelles"....Car aucune n'a réussi à créer le bonheur universel. Il y a toujours eu des opprimés ou des laissés pour compte, même dans la société théoriquement sans classes de l'URSS.

De nos jours je ne pense pas que la proximité soit un élément vital pour une civilisation. De même la notion de territoire et de terre n'est pas nécessaire à la création d'une civilisation.<br>  <br>  Mais à bien y réfléchir je ne pense pas que l'on est besoin de créer une civilisation. Si des individus partages une même ambition ils finiront forcement pas ce c?toyer. Au début ils formeront une communauté (même virtuel), ou une fraternité. Puis éventuellement ils se constitueront en association ou en société. Ce sont les fa?ons les plus simples de mettre des ressources en commun.<br>  Et au final ils deviendront une civilisation. Cependant, il ne ce nommeront probablement pas eux-mêmes "civilisation". C'est un titre que est généralement donné par d'autre extérieur (ou prétendument) au groupe. C'est ainsi que la civilisation Occidental n'est née qu'au moment ou elle à elle-même reconnut les autres civilisations existante.<br>  <br>  On aurait du mal à parler de civilisation sans parler de barbare.

Solo dios tiene un por que, y es liberar de la responsabilidad de una fragil existencia a aquel que necesite una muleta existencial. Ni siquiera dios puede vivir un mismo momento 2 veces, ni siquiera dios escapa a su destino... la condena de que las cosas solo puedan pasar de una manera en cada universo.<br>  <br>  Que nos queda entonces? Esperar que nuestra cadena de acontecimientos llegue a su fin? Incluso suicidarnos seria una consecuencia inevitable del destino...

Despues de un tiempo obtendras resultados y voloraras las situaciones.es como poner todo en una Balanza... nunca hay que ser rencorosos, y siempre hay que recordar que nosotros tambien traicionamos...

Portanto n?o devemos julgar para n?o sermos julgados. <br>  <br>                   A via mais rápida para o sucesso pessoal é aprimoramento interior. De instante em instante devemos nos auto-observar para percebermos o que nos move a cometer os nossos pequenos delitos. So podemos eliminar aquilo que conhecemos.<br>  <br>                    Devemos carregar esta cruz, trabalhar constantemete sobre nós mesmos, se queremos verdadeiramente nos tornarmos pessoas melhores que no passado.<br>  <br>                  Tudo isto que escrevi acima tem possui um sentido muito próximo a esta passagem da vida de Jesus Cristo, a este sacrifício que foi feito pro nós e que devemos trazê-lo para nossas vidas. <br>                    <br>  Um grande Abra?o a todos!!!|`|862615f2cee99165e074e6c57fdcd0aeaa	A nossa parte humana sempre será fraca e Cristo revela isso nesta frase.

Nos E.U.A., o ponto de vista que prevalece é que os bombardeios terminaram a guerra meses mais cedo do que haveria acontecido, salvando muitas vidas que seriam perdidas em ambos os lados se a invas?o planejada do Jap?o tivesse ocorrido. No Jap?o, o público geral tende a crer que os bombardeios foram desnecessários, uma vez que a prepara??o para a rendi??o já estava em progresso em Tóquio.As bombas de Hiroshima e Nagasaki foram a segunda e terceira a serem detonadas e as únicas que já foram empregues como armas de destrui??o em massa.<br>  A decis?o de largar as bombas sobre o Jap?o foi tomada pelo Presidente dos E.U.A. da altura, Harry Truman. A sua inten??o pública de ordenar os bombardeamentos foi de trazer um fim célere à guerra por inflic??o de destrui??o e terror de subsequente destrui??o, obrigando o Jap?o a apresentar a sua rendi??o. Em 26 de Julho, Truman e outros líderes aliados redigiram a Declara??o de Potsdam, a qual delineava os termos da rendi??o do Jap?o:<br>  <br>  "...O poder que agora converge sobre o Jap?o é imensuravelmente superior ao que, quando aplicado ao Nazis resistentes, semeou de forma necessária a destrui??o pelas terras, pela indústria e forma de vida de todo o povo alem?o. A plena aplica??o do nosso poder militar, apoiado pela nossa determina??o, significará a inevitável e completa destrui??o das for?as armadas japonesas e a igualmente inevitável e completa devasta??o da pátria japonesa..." <br>  "...Apelamos ao Governo do Jap?o que proclame agora a rendi??o incondicional de todas as for?as armadas japonesas, e o fornecimento de garantias próprias e adequadas da sua boa fé em tal ac??o. A alternativa para o Jap?o é a rápida e total destrui??o." <br>  No dia seguinte, jornais japoneses noticiavam que a declara??o, cujo texto tinha sido radiodifundido e largado em papéis sobre o Jap?o, tinha sido rejeitada. A bomba atómica era ainda um segredo fortemente guardado e n?o mencionado na declara??o.<br>  O Conselho de Alvos (em inglês, Target Committee) de Los Alamos recomendou, a 10 e 11 de Maio de 1945, as cidades de Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama e o arsenal em Kokura como possíveis alvos. O Conselho rejeitou o uso da arma contra um alvo estritamente militar devido à hipótese de falhar um pequeno alvo que n?o fosse rodeado por uma grande área urbana. Os efeitos psicológicos no Jap?o eram de enorme importancia para os membros do Conselho. Também concordaram entre si que o uso inicial da arma deveria ser suficientemente espectacular e importante por forma a ser reconhecido internacionalmente. O Conselho sentiu que Kyoto, sendo um dos centros intelectuais do Jap?o, tinha uma popula??o "melhor preparada para compreender o significado da arma". Hiroshima foi escolhida devido à sua grande dimens?o e ao potencial de destrui??o que poderia demonstrar após ser atingida.[1]<br>  <br>  O Secretário de Guerra Henry Stimson excluiu Kyoto da lista devido à sua importancia cultural, enfrentando objec??es do General Leslie Groves, administrador do Projecto Manhattan. De acordo com o Professor Edwin O. Reischauer, Stimson "tinha conhecido e admirado Kyoto desde a altura em que aí tinha passado a sua lua-de-mel, várias décadas antes". O General Carl Spaatz elegeu Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata e Nagasaki como alvos, pela ordem indicada.|`|7WCOUaDqaa	As raz?es foram 3:<br>  1 - Os kamicases estavam assombrando os Estados Unidos e eles n?o sabiam quando aquele inferno ia terminar.<br>  2 -- Era a oportunidade de testar a bomba e mostrar ao mundo o seu poderio.<br>  3 -- E a mais importante: Apesar de terem feito represálias antes, continuavam com o Jap?o atravessado na guela, como se diz no popular, devido ao massacre japonês em Peal Arbour (n?o sei se está escrito correto).

No caso as bombas teriam o efeito de deter o avan?o soviético. Me parece que o alto escal?o do governo japones ficou aliviado por assinar a rendi??o para os EEUU.|`|38ef015633f239587936c73a83659f0baa	Os americanos quiseram intimidar a URSS, que saiu vencedora da guerra contra a Alemanha. Aliás, os aliados desembarcaram na Normandia em 1944, menos de um ano antes do fim da guerra, porque perceberam que a URSS libertaria a Europa inteira sozinha e isto n?o correspondia aos interesses dos chamados "aliados", que a única coisa que queriam era que a Alemanha destruisse a URSS, por isso entregaram a Tchecoslováquia e n?o reagiram à anexa??o da áustria, mas, erraram nos cálculos, os russos nunca perderam uma guerra (a n?o ser a guerra fria) e n?o seria dessa vez que perderiam.|`|0faaf8fa3b7a14f449d2bca46f87d6b3aa	resposta<br>  resumo sobre Americanos jogaram as bombas atomicas em hiroshima e nagasaki, sendo que o jap?o ja estava saindo=<br>  O fim da guerra=Já em 1944 a guerra na ásia come?ava a progredir devagar, já n?o mantendo o ritmo inicial da guerra. Em Mar?o de 1944, as for?as japonesas ocuparam a Birmania e deram início a um ataque contra a índia, mas acabaram por ser derrotadas em Impanhal. No Norte da China, as for?as japonesas, come?aram a enfrentar as for?as comunistas de Mao Zedong. A Guerra Sino-Japonesa, que mobilizava mais de um milh?o de homens, gastava mais recursos que a Campanha do Sul. Em 1944, depois de lan?ada a última ofensiva em Ichi Go, o Império japonês, tomou grande parte do Sul da China Central, estabelecendo uma liga??o terrestre com a Indochina.<br>  <br>  A quando a vitória japonesa na China, as for?as Aliadas do Pacífico haviam chegado perto do arquipélago nipónico. Em 1945, a captura das ilhas de Iwo Jima (em Fevereiro) e Okinawa (em Abril), pelos Aliados, trouxeram o Jap?o para dentro do alcance de ataques aéreos e navais, come?ando assim os bombardeamentos a fábricas e instala??es militares na ilha principal. Esses bombardeamentos, executados por bombardeiros norte-americanos B-29 entre Mar?o e Junho, acabaram por destruir 58 cidades japonesas, matando mais de 393 000 civis.<br>  <br>  Em inícios de Agosto o Imperador Hirohito, verificando as elevadas perdas nos últimos conflitos, autorizou que o embaixador japonês na Uni?o Soviética contactasse Estaline para apresentar uma rendi??o do Jap?o. Estaline recebeu a mensagem algumas horas antes da conferência dos Aliados na Alemanha, apresentando assim a rendi??o japonesa a Harry Truman. Os Aliados pediam ao Jap?o uma rendi??o incondicional, contudo o Jap?o decidiu n?o responder devido aos termos de rendi??o dos Aliados n?o especificarem o futuro do Imperador — visto como um deus para o povo japonês — tal como o sistema imperial. Harry Truman, após a sua chegada à conferência, recebeu uma mensagem que indicava que o teste da bomba atómica "Trinity" tinha sido bem sucedido; decidido a ganhar a guerra utilizando o projecto Manhattan deu indica??es a Estaline para ignorar a mensagem japonesa e Estaline também com a idéia de ganhar territórios no Pacífico, ilhas conquistadas pelo Jap?o, concordou com Truman.<br>  <br>  A 6 de Agosto, a bomba atómica "Little Boy", foi lan?ada sobre Hiroshima do B-29 "Enola Gay", pelo "esquadr?o Atómico", contudo esta bomba n?o teve o efeito esperado, n?o tendo qualquer reac??o no Imperador Hirohito e do Gabinete de Guerra japonês. Muito do povo japonês desconhecia ainda o ataque a Hiroshima, pois as esta??es de rádio e jornais n?o relataram nada sobre o ataque, apenas sobre um novo tipo de bomba desenvolvido.A 8 de Agosto de 1945 a Uni?o Soviética declarou guerra ao Jap?o, como tinha concordado na conferência, e lan?ou uma invas?o (Opera??o Tempestade de Agosto, August Storm) em grande escala à Manchúria, que se encontrava ocupada pelo Jap?o — tal invas?o é reconhecida pelos japoneses como o que teve mais efeito para o fim da guerra.<br>  <br>  Truman decidiu n?o esperar por uma resposta do Jap?o, ordenando assim o lan?amento de uma segunda bomba atómica, a "Fat Man" que foi lan?ada pelo B-29 "Bock's Car" sobre Nagasaki a 9 de Agosto.<br>  <br>  A 14 de Agosto o Jap?o rende-se incondicionalmente, após aquelas cidades terem sido atingidas pelos engenhos nucleares, que causaram cerca de 300 mil mortos instantaneamente, e um número indeterminado de vítimas posteriormente, devido à contamina??o pela radia??o. As chefias militares norte-americanas justificaram esta ac??o afirmando que uma invas?o do Jap?o teria custos elevados em termos de vidas de soldados americanos.<br>  <br>  O Jap?o assinou a rendi??o a bordo do USS Missouri, na baía de Tóquio, no dia 15 de Agosto, sendo celebrada a vitória nesse dia, conhecido como Dia V-J.
