AA10250756	If you stay downtown, there are taxis and there is a trolley that goes around downtown and Ybor City. Why are you going to Tampa and what are you planning to do? If you are going for Busch Gardens, then some of the hotels near Busch Gardens have a shuttle service to Busch Gardens.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	If you stay in downtown Tampa, you can rely on cabs and public transportation to get around.  If you want to venture further out, I highly suggest renting a car.  I recently visited the Tampa Bay Area and stayed in Clearwater.  Clearwater is a nice place to stay.  I had an easy drive to the beaches and to both Tampa and St. Petersburg.  It's a good central location.
LAXbJfvwaa	On the east coast.  It is a state, whereas Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Melbourne and Perth are all cities.  On the east coast you have Queensland at the top which stretches about half way down the coast, then New South Wales is below that and Victoria is below NSW.  (In the lower end of NSW is the Australian Capital Teritory - one of only two Territories - the other being the Northern Teritory on the top middle area of Australia)|`|uAyYRXnvaa	It's a little below Brisbane and to the right of Ayres Rock.  btw - throw out that travel book.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	NSW is on the East Coast of Australia, in between Queensland and Victoria...

Brisbane is roughly 1000km north of sydney in the state of Queensland and Melbourne is roughly 1000km south in the state of Victoria.  Cairns is at almost the very top of Australia.  Darwin is central north of Australia in the Northern Territory with Alice Spings about 1500km south in the same Territory, Ayers Rock or Uluru is about 300km west of Alice Springs.   Perth is the world's most isolated city on the west coast and is about 4000km from most east coast cities, Adelaide is on the south coast about 1/2 way between Perth and Melbourne.  Now don't forget our little island state of Tasmania whose capital is Hobart, which lies south of Melbourne across Bass Strait.  Keep in mind mainland Australia is 80% the size of the US, so we are still a large country.  For example it took me, by coach, 36 hours to go from Alice Springs to Sydney.    When it comes to flying to Australia most international flights land in Melbourne and Sydney, with quite a few landing in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide as well.|`|Fhro4oUaaa	The worst for just about everything|`|4b1e6590878cc0511f0141d75afbee83aa	New South Wales is in South East Australia, beautiful place.

l95ndpTWaa	It's possible, but it's going to be pretty hard with that much.  I currently live upstate and my boyfriend is from Patchogue.  We've got more than that and believe that it's not going to work out well if we move to LI with what we currently have.    If you've both already got a job on the Island, then you may be alright.    Here's a theory I have....If your rent cannot be paid with one week's pay, it's not sufficient for you to live on.  It's worked out well for me so far.    Take into account both of your outside expenses.  It may be worth your while to stay upstate a few more years and make sure you have Backup Plan money.  The Island is pretty expensive.
3jxBWMVeaa	Schools are very different in Australia than America. For one thing, we learn about the world around us.     We have Pre-school maybe 1-2 hours 2 times a week for 2-3year olds. Parents go too and they paint and play and stuff.     Kindergarden here is not school, there is 3 year old kinder and 4 year old kinder, both the same thing. Kids go for anywhere between 2.5 and 5 hours 2 or 3 times a week and paint, play, make, create.     Then there's Primary school, most kids start at 5 years old, some do at 4 or 6. Primary school includes Prep, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5 and Grade 6. You go from 9-3.30 at my old primary school, Mon-Fri obviously.    After that we go to High School, which includes Year 7, Year 8, Year 9, Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12. My school hours are currently 9.00-3.10, however on Wednesday's we (year 12s) finish at 12.30.    That's my school times in Melbourne Victoria.    Sucks for whoever it was with only 6 weeks summer, I had 11 weeks this summer just past.|`|gAnDkNchaa	In primary school I went to school from 8:25 - 3:35  and now in secondary school I go from 8:30 - 3:30  So it's about 7 hours.  Those are private school times though.  Public schools run for less time in my state.|`|AA12074269	Different states have different hours. In SA primary is Year 1-7, high school is 8-12. High school is 9-3.30pm with some school having one early day that finishes around 3pm|`|zYkf4J49aa	From other answers, it is obviously different all over Australia.    My child, in Queensland, started middle school in year 7, her primary school ended in year 6.    She moves up to senior school for years 11 and 12.    Her middle school hours are 8:45 to 3:15, 5 days a week.|`|8phHXAO7aa	Primary school kids go 6 hours per day, starting at 9am and finishing at 3pm.  When they get to highschool and college they usually go 6 hours, but some schools tack on an extra half hour or so.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	We have a different tier of schooling in Australia. Primary - Kindergarten to year 6, and Secondary - Year 7 to Year 12. We don't call our grades sophomores or seniors, etc..     Generally schools hours are between 8.00am and 4.00pm with primary school kids attending approx 6 hours and high school 6.5 hours. This varies between schools and private schools can also be longer hours. Never more then 7 hours in my experience unless you go to a senior college, some of these have a 4 day week so you are there for longer hours.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	You have answers regarding school hours around Australia.  Often Private, Independant and Church schools have a longer school day and longer holidays (vacation) than the state (public) schools.    We only have Primary school and Secondary or High school, no Middle school.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	Im in Western australia  From pre-school ( 5 yr old) its normaly 3 or 4 half days  from yr 1-7 ( ages 6 - 12 )which is primary school - its gereraly 6 hours . 9 - 3 is the norm  from yr 8-12 ( ages 13 - 17 ) is high school. and thats around 6 hours aswell , from 9-3  years 11 and 12 are seniors and depending on how many classes they choose , they may finish the day earlier or even start later then others ( while others have a free period in the middle of the day)  each term goes for around 6 weeks?? i think  , 2 week break inbetween terms and around 6 weeks holiday over christmas    But every school varys slightly and every State / territory varys aswell|`|zOyWCvqtaa	Both answers are correct.  Each individual school has varying hours, but they usually lie between 8am - 9am start and 2pm - 3pm finish, on average.  In NSW and most other states there are 4 terms per year, with a 2 week break between each term.  We have roughly 6 weeks of holiday during Christmas, which is basically our version of summer vacation.  In NSW (and I think many other states), in senior high school you have a leaving certificate (called HSC in NSW) which is based around subjects you select in year 11.  On average you do 6 x 2 Unit subjects for a total of 12 units.  If you pick a 3 unit or 4 Unit subject you may need to attend extra hours at school for these subjects.|`|Ze25ovEiaa	We don't have elementary, middle and high school, just primary (kindy to year 6) and high school (years 7 to 12).  Primary schools usually start at around 9, and finish at around 3.  Times for high schools, however, can vary.   Eg these two high schools in my area:  School 1- starts at 8:45, finishes at 3:00, Monday to Friday.  School 2- starts at 8:45, finishes at 2:10 on Mondays, 2:45 on Tuesdays (or 12:30 for year 11 and 12s), 3:00 Wednesday- Friday  I'd say the average is 6 hours a day.|`|sZFA4XXZaa	Primary - around 9.00 - 3.00.  High school - 8.30 to 3.05 for me
pzLDXL6gaa	I don't think there's a list available. Most schools require uniforms. However the quality of the uniforms varies. Some have ties, blazers etc. whereas for others it's just a coloured polo shirt and shorts. It varies by state but in general public schools have a basic uniform. Some schools only have a colour code and by college (the last two years) a lot of public schools drop their uniform requirements. Private schools mostly have uniforms except for some small independent ones e.g. Steiner schools.    Harriet|`|xs2mpYjWaa	I know the Illawarra Senior College doesn't wear a uniform.     They are only for years 10 - 12. Try other seniors colleges.     I really don't see the big deal about not wearing a uniform, you will have to once you get a job so just deal with it. Saves having to try and find something to wear everyday.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	There would be very, very few schools here which don't require their students to wear uniform.|`|zOyWCvqtaa	Most public and private schools require students to wear a uniform.  In saying that some schools are a bit more relaxed in how the uniform is worn, in that as long you have the basic uniform on all is well.  The opposite is also true with a number of schools being virtual uniform dictatorships to the point of even determining what kind of jewelery you wear or how you wear you hair.    Also no uniform is free and most private schools require you to wear a uniform bought from the schools uniform shop or sponsored retailer.  Some schools (such as the one I attented) are happy with a basic colour for example any sort of white button up shirt and grey trousers or shorts with black shoes...which was my senior uniform.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	im in WA and the high school i went to , we only had to wear the school tops , didnt matter what shorts / skirts / jeans we wore.  it was a public school tho . All the private schools that ive heard of have strict uniform codes .|`|RjuciIbbaa	um no i think all the school's in australia wear uniforms well at least all the schools i have gone to do.|`|3jxBWMVeaa	I know Box Hill Senior doesn't have a uniform, Resevoir has a t shirt but you don't have to wear it, there are maybe 10 around Victoria that I've heard of, not sure of the others names.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	Indooroopilly SHS in Brisbane is a non-uniform school.

90tPT5nlaa	I think it's excessive, our economy just isn't that bad. So unemployment rose by 0.1%, at 4.4% it's still very low. I agree this could be the opportunity to really fix public transport and also our ports. Very few people use public transport (including me) because it just isn't good enough - you can't park at the stations, different transports don't connect, bus stops aren't sheltered, not enough bus pull out lanes etc. And boats waiting weeks or months to use our ports is ridiculous.    I own three small retail businesses, and sure, it would help me to give everyone all that money. But I think it doesn't need to be so much for our economy.|`|nINIHF8baa	Doesn't affect me.    I didn't get anything out of the last ''cash for votes'' handout to everyone from the lower middle class and the upper middle class and I won't be getting anything out of the next one.  No, I'm not well off.  I'm absolutely destitute and barely have money for what little food ($15/wk) I do buy.  Most of the time I don't even buy my life saving medications.    I'm one of those disabled people that the powers that be won't put on a Disability pension because they don't want to blow their very limited budget and therefore I'm at the age of 63 and unable to walk more than 10 metres and on Newstart which is Unemployment Benefits.    I haven't bought any clothing in 15 years.  I haven't bought any whitegoods in 15 years even though my stove/oven no longer works, my freezer no longer works, my washing machine no longer works  I haven't eaten meat in over 4 years  I do not buy fruit and vegetables and haven't in around 2.5 years  I haven't been outside my suburb in 5 years except when I have to hand in my unemployment form.  I haven't bought anything except for flour, powdered milk, sugar and oil in over 2.5 years.  I no longer give or receive xmas, birthday or any other celebratory presents  I no longer meet up with friends for coffee or a meal  I no longer have a telephone, depending on the cheapest rate for internet to keep a small amount of communication with my relatives  I don't go to movies, theatres, plays, concerts or any entertainment and havent in over 10 years.  I don't go to any sporting events or venues  I havent been to have my eyes tested in 15 years - and yes i know I can get a free eye test, but I can't afford to buy new glasses so there's no point.  I haven't been to a dentist in over 15 years.  Although I have been on the Dental Hospitals Emergency list for several years without getting an appointment yet.  There are many doctors specialist appointments and the like which I do not make/go to because I quite simply don't have the money to pay for the visit and/or treatment and medicines.  I don't buy my prescription medicine even though its at a highly reduced rate because I use over $80/month on medicine even at the reduced rate and as a single person, the spend per year has to be over $2,500 to become free.    So after all that rant - no, I haven't had a hand out yet and won't be getting one because quite simply, I'm one of those people that the government would rather curled up their toes and died and saved them the trouble of paying them a livable pension.|`|sZFA4XXZaa	My main concern is WHAT people actually spend it on. It wouldn't really do much if the money ends up in places which they're not meant to.    There should've been forms posted out allowing us to select WHICH company we wish to buy from and HOW MUCH for each. Eg. $500 for Coles and $450 for Myer. We should also get them in vouchers.    Gamblers will benefit and so will casinos. Gamblers will think it's not their money so it doesn't matter if they lose but will be grateful if they win from it. So no to pure cash.    I wouldn't be surprised when drug dealer arrests increase now.|`|pvZr203eaa	I quite agree that there must be better ways to spend the money than supporting certain industries such as building and insulation.  For example, how about a temporary suspension or reduction of some of the numerous govt charges and taxes levied on business, possibly resulting in stimulating more employment.  On the personal taxpayer situation, instead of the 'handout' how about a temporary reduction of the GST, which would benefit everybody.|`|zOyWCvqtaa	I agree with it to a point.  Sadly the $950 will most likely go to bills incl rent or mortgage so won't really be used to stimulate the economy as much.    As for long term solutions I'd like to see more money pumped into infrastructure esp roads, schools and hospitals AND make sure the states keep their hands off this money so it goes right where it's needed.    I remember the recession of the early 1990's and I generally think Kevin is doing the right thing this time to avoid another 1990's.|`|zYkf4J49aa	I agree with you completely.    Out of the last cash handout of $10 Billion ?, our retail trade only went up by just under $1 Billion, compared to last years figures, and part of that was expected due to inflation.    God knows where the other $9 billion went, but it doesn't look like it was spent as they hoped.    Maybe this three day government discussion on the subject will come up with better ideas, but ... if it is removed I lose almost $3,000, and I could use that to reduce my mortgage.|`|an1b4pXxaa	I think it's silly to hand out money willynilly. It would be much better spend on infrastructure at least then even if the spending didn't help the economy we would have a nice new road or school.    Some of the money should definitely be spent on hospitals, the ones in Perth are a disgrace, my poor old father has been in Charlie Gardeners all week and they still haven't had time to do the tests to find out what is wrong with him!  Appalling!|`|xs2mpYjWaa	The cash handout is expected to be spent and put back into the economy. As was last years, but as pensioners do (and often need to) they put it in savings or paid bills. $950 for school kids will help pay for school fees, books, etc.. If we spend the money we are given then yes it will help. But not just blowing it on cr*p either.     To be honest, I don't use public transport very often, maybe once per year to go into the city or if I'm on holidays. So it doesn't really effect me.     Insulation, well we already have insulation and so do a lot of people, as you said those that don't are most likely renting. The reasoning behind the insulation is that it should help combat climate change by reduce the need for Air conditioning I'm guessing.     Again school buildings, I went through the private school system so public schools do nothing for me. My friends kids and my future kids also go through the private system. I have seen some public schools with much better facilities then my private schools had. We never had air conditioning and it was only a 10 year old school.     I am sure there are some that are falling to bits and they should be made safe, but they don't need to be luxurious. I hope that it doesn't go to all schools because some, don't need it. If the government wants schools to be air conditioned then they should supply it to private schools too. Private schools never get a cent from the government so they seem to miss out. I would love to know what they do with all our school fees, not spend it on the buildings I can assure you.     So I don't really agree or disagree as it doesn't have much impact on me. I am all for money to be spent on hospitals though. I like to think thats where my tax goes. Sure I haven't needed a hospital but I'm sure some day I will. Then again I have private health insurance also.. Hahaha, it's a lose/lose situation.     Again with roads, if they spent it on the roads I use yeh sure. But they don't. Welfare, too many bludgers and to be honest, I will never get anything (there will be no aged pension in 40 years time) so I don't really want my taxes towards that either.     Perhaps I should just say, think of me when you spend your $950

AA12198724	Well for an affordable ride take the airtrain to the train station and you can take the e all the way to times square or wherever you are going. Try not to look like a tourist, dont walk around with your map in your hand and if you are with other people dont just stop on a busy sidewalk. Real new yorkers get their directions from http://www.hopstop.com if they are taking public transportation.  Cab rides from the airport are like 30-50 bucks not including tip so I hope you have an idea of how much you need saved. Go to hopstop to get an estimate of how much it will cost to get to certain destinations. I recommend to stick only with yellow taxis or services...make sure they are not ghost taxis. Car services liscence plates are like T435543C and say T&LC on the top of the liscence plate.  Also dont wear your camera on your neck its soo cheesy and dont walk in clusters if you are with a group of people, they will know you are a tourist. Also separate your money if you are trying to haggle for some merchandise in chinatown.  Just try to blend in...|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, when you land at JFK, the best way to get from airport to Manhattan will be by public transit, which is cheap. You can take the Airtrain, which is an automated airport train to Jamaica station. Once there you can make a connection to either the subway or the Long Island Railroad, which will take straight to Manhattan.    I be glad to help you with travel direction from JFK to Manhattan. Just drop me a line by clicking on the avatar and e-mail icon in the profile.    Good luck|`|jLTDqVHsaa	The $5 AirTrain was built specifically for people like you, flying into JFK and needing to get around New York.  It comes every 2-4 minutes during the day, and every 4-8 late nights.  It stops at all JFK terminals.    What part of NYC do you need to get to?  You can easily get anywhere, but once you get on the AirTrain, your options expand a bit, so it's hard to pin down exactly what you need to do from there.  Your options include the A train from Howard Beach, and the E/J/Z subways as well as the Long Island Rail Road at Jamaica.  Most likely, Jamaica will be the place to go for the train you need.  But provide some additional detail and we'll be able to help you out.    In short, it's a nice, very convenient system.    Public transportation directions are available at:    http://tripplanner.mta.info  -That's the MTA.  It works within the five boroughs, but doesn't allow you to select the LIRR.  It does, however, allow you to select route preferences and de-select certain types of routes (such as $5 express buses) if you don't want to take them.    http://maps.google.com  -That's Google Maps.  It doesn't quite allow the same route customization that the MTA Trip Planner allows, but it DOES include ALL area services, and allows you a selection from suggested routes.  It also gives you a graphic representation of your route.  Combine it with Street View, and it's a very powerful tool.    http://www.hopstop.com  -HopStop has improved quite a lot over the years since I first found it, and it's become quite a tool, with all of the benefits of the above suggestions, except Street View.    EDIT: Your hotel is on 38th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues.  That's a bit of a tricky spot for mass transit, so I'll give you a few options I'd say are reasonable.  All start with the AirTrain to Jamaica:    -LIRR to Penn Station.  Walk to hotel.  -LIRR to Penn Station.  M34 bus to Javits Center, walk about a block and a half to hotel.  -LIRR to Penn Station.  Cab to hotel.  -E subway to 42 St.  M42 to as close to 38th Street as possible along 11th Avenue.  Should be within a block or two.  -E subway to 42 St.  Walk to hotel.  -E subway to 42 or 34 St.  Cab to hotel.    I rarely suggest a cab, but your hotel is not very convenient to the subway, and you might be carrying some luggage, so the convenience of a cab might be welcome here.  That said, the AirTrain/LIRR or E is convenient enough so that I wouldn't recommend a cab until you got to Times Square or Penn Station.

hgmgH83Xaa	According to weather.com, the average high temperature in houston, tx was 79 degrees F, and the average low was 61 Farenheit. http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/va...    Here is the link for the page on weather.com that will provide you with a graph of houston's record temperatures.     Here is an excerpt from weather.com that gives tips on what to wear when you're visiting Houston.     Apparently, April is the best time to go, there are lots of festivals and such during this time of year in Houston.    Houston's hot, humid summers necessitate cool, light-colored clothing from May through October. Sunscreen protection is important for those prone to burning. While temperatures may be steamy during summer months, winters can be cool. A heavy coat is rarely needed, although a jacket is often called for between November and March. Rain can be expected from April through June, especially in the afternoons.    Casual attire is appropriate for most activities in Houston, although you'll want to bring some dressier attire for restaurants and clubs. Houston is not a formal city but some restaurants do require jackets. In the business areas, especially downtown, the Uptown Galleria area, and Greenway Plaza, business suits are the norm.      Have Fun!|`|flkVehA9aa	Yes, about 2.2 millon people live in Houston, and about 5.6 millon live in the greater Houston area.     The weather at the end of April will be perfect.  Sunny and mild.  Warm, but not too hot.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	It will be warm but not blazing hot. I'd bring cotton shirts (just me b/c it breathes) & shorts & maybe some jeans in case. It depends what you plan on doing. I can't speak much for Galveston beach or I'd say bring the swimsuits too.|`|86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	It'll be nearing the 80's by that time.  Casual dress is good for most places with business casual good enough for the better restaurants. Oh, bring an umbrella just in case.|`|a7AiC90yaa	bring shorts and T-shirts.    On the weekend of 17th - 18th and the 24th - 25th weekend.    we got Old Town Crawfish Fest.   www.texascrawfishfestival.com    also the Houston International Festival -   www.ifest.org|`|Ev6ruMeNaa	I do it can get up into the 100's in the summer and its unbearably hot! but it has a pretty comfortable mild winter though.|`|LCun3uwTaa	bring shorts, skirts, dress, and a hoodie, and an umbrella--for rain and also a weapon.|`|4pqu1SWAaa	It will probably be in the 80's at the end of April.  It could be rainy, as well.    People dress casually for most things. Shorts and Flip-flops.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Hot 75-80's normally. It's a dry heat.   But, bring an umbrella (:  You'll love it & never want to leave. Great food & culture. Check out some live music.|`|mC91jDUKaa	April is one of the best times to be here weather-wise... spring in Houston is quite nice!|`|CSKCstqhaa	It should be beautiful in April, around 80 or so, breezy, partly cloudy, with a chance of rain at least half the month. You should be comfortable in jeans or shorts and t-shirts. Pack an umbrella and raincoats

Metropolitan Museum have great special exhibition and very good place to eat.  Both Metropolitan Museum and Cloisters are suggested admission which means pay-what-you-wish.    American Museum of Natural History has great collection of Dinosaurs, mammals from past.  They also have great special exhibition. You c    I she is interested in Jewish history, you could check out Jewish Museum at 5th Av/92nd St, or Living Memorial Holocaust Museum at Battery Park City in Downtown Manhattan.    If she is interest in New York City history, you could visit New York City Museum.  NYC Museum has history of Great Fire, well as historical antique dollhouse and toys, and history of Broadway Musical.    Right across from Natural History at 77th St, there is New York Historical Society, another interested place.|`|Ge6oHWQ1aa	Metropolitan Museum of Art  http://www.metmuseum.org/  1000 Fifth Avenue    Museum of Modern Art  http://www.moma.org/  11 West 53 Street,  between Fifth and Sixth avenues|`|iN27E3WCaa	For something a little different, you can go to the Cloisters: http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/th...|`|2EVoNHHbaa	It fully depends upon what she's interested in.    If she's into classical art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art can't be beat.    If she's into modern art, the Museum of Modern Art is tops.    If she likes natural history, don't miss the American Museum of Natural History.    If she likes astronomy, the Rose Center/Hayden Planetarium is out of this world!    If she had ancestors who came into this country through Ellis Island, that's a great place to visit.    If she likes ships and the sea, visit the South Street Seaport Museum.    There are many, many more such museums to suggest.  What's she into?|`|AA12198724	All the tourists go to the Museum of Natural History.  I used to volunteer there and I loved it, its great but too many tourists and schoolkids. Museum of Sex I have been dying to go to. Now thats a great one, its really cool but if you want something more appropriate go to MOMA, The Museum of Modern Art. Its free and you donate how much you want (a penny, quarter etc) and the Artwork is great, I think Picasso has some stuff in there. The Guggenheim is wonderful though, I went a few years ago to see some work from Rosenquest. It was wonderful I wanna go back but I have to spend my funds on school. I have to work at the Intrepid Next week so if you guys are into military and aircrafts then that would be a great one but I think that you should stick with the art museums though, its wonderful work, makes great wallpapers but dont use flash photography and your girlfriend would think you were really caring of her to take her to the art museums. Trust me you will not be bored. You can actually go to all of them I recommend not going on weekends. Try going during 9am-2pm since all the kids are going to be in school and adults at work.|`|DnOC8Zdhaa	Metropolitan Museum Of Art & Transit MUseum located in Brooklyn.|`|fFnsJ7maaa	First: The Metropolitan Museum of Art. HUGE, so just pick a couple of sections.    Second: The Frick Collection. A rich guy's house filled with art. Small and manageable.     Third: Museum of Modern Art.|`|AA11435892	You cant go wrong with the Museum of Natural History especially if she loves the movie, A Night at the Museum.     Check out the two museums in Bowling Green, Sports Museum of America (really interesting for the athlete), and The American Museum of the Native American (or something like that), run by the Smithsonian so its a free admission.    You also cant go wrong with MOMA, or the Frisch Collection.

c0e126fe517c24eb472251064f5e066caa	Avendo solo 10 giorni a disposizione ti consiglio di concentrarti solo in una area. Le bellissime isole che sono pi distanti dalle 2 principali richiedono molto tempo.  Dunque ti suggerisco di fermarti nell'isola VITI LEVU nella citt di Nadi come punto-base. Troverai alberghi pi a buon mercato che sulle isole che ti propongo di visitare.  Di l puoi raggiungere in un giorno (andata e ritorno) l'arcipelago delle Mamanucas dove le isole pi belle sono Beachcomber (mezza giornata) e Castaway (ti ricordi l'omonimo film ?) (ci vuole una giornata intera).  Inoltre visita l'arcipelago delle Yasawa (di natura vulcanica) dove ti dovrai fermare a dormire essendo distanti.

E' difficile perche' ognuno tendera' a dire che la  "sua " e' la piu' bella citta.  Ma sara' impossibile per chiunque negare che il "Colosseo" simbolo dell'impero romano si trova a Roma,Cosi' come la basilica di San Pietro cosi' come il foro romano,cosi' come Castel Sant'angelo che ha la bellezza di 2000 anni ed e' ancora intatto.Guardate piazza del popolo guardatela bene,e piazza navona,in cui gli imperatori si divertivano a giocare a battaglia navale.....(la facevano allagare ,ci mettevano le barche e cominciava il gioco )  Insomma oggi Roma e' rovinata dal traffico dalla presenza di tutta la classe politica,un po' rovinata anche dai romani,ma e' fuori discussione che sia la piu' bella citta' del mondo  Io amo moltissimo Venezia per il suo feel particolare,ma quando ci penso a fondo capisco che Roma e' la numero 1,piaccia o non piaccia.|`|AA10354915	No 1: Roma  No 2: Perugia  No 3: Urbino  No 4: Ravenna|`|5c6b397034543af678b157e41a5e75a2aa	Sono tutte BELLE.|`|a29b2c9b3c523c88e4bed9f6018cea37aa	secondo me roma|`|f229d6a7cf47f58ca23f25e7513ba3b9aa	Premetto che Firenze non la metto xche' ancora mi manca da poter visitare!!

Barcellona ...mille cose da vedere...    Quant' bella Barcellona!!!   Cos bella da farmi desiderare di tornarvi (spero presto) per la quarta volta...   cos bella da farmi richiedere qualche anno fa il trasferimento per lavoro (ma la possibilit che si era prospettata poi purtroppo sfum). Una citt cos viva e piena di colori, una citt cos interessante e simpatica al tempo stesso.   Quando arrivi con il pulmann dall'aeroporto al centro di Barcellona a Placa de la Catalunya, se non fosse per i bagagli che hai appresso, gi ti viene voglia di farti una bella camminata lungo la Rambla che unisce quella piazza con il mare...   Sbrigati!!!! posa tutti i bagagli in albergo che ne hai di cose da vedere!!!!   Una bella passeggiata per la Rambla ti dar il primo impatto con i colori della citt e con la sua simpatia, la rambla con i suoi chioschi di fiori, di uccelli, di souvenir, di giornali e di souvenir, la rambla con i suoi spettacoli estemporanei, una passeggiata che non si dimentica facilmente, una passeggiata che ti porta al molo dove trovi la statua dedicata a Colombo che si vede da diverse parti della citt.   Risalendo per il centro conviene passare per il barrio Gotico, un'affascinante quartiere medievale che ha il suo centro nella bellissima Cattedrale.   Quanto scommettete che non potrete fare a meno di fotografare le oche che troverete nel chiostro?   Devo dire che mi ritengo molto fortunato nell'aver assistito dal vivo ad un bello spettacolo nel Barrio Gotico:   c'era un'orchestrina che suonava dal vivo la musica tipica della Catalogna...la Sardana. Le persone che facevano shopping avevano lasciato le loro buste della spesa per terra e formavano degli specie di girotondo. Presi per mano si muovevano a tempo con la musica, un passo avanti, un passo indietro, braccia in alto e poi in basso, un passo a lato, tutti insieme persone che non si conoscono, giovani ed anziani ballano la Sardana. Uno spettacolo emozionante...peccato non sapere la giusta sequenza dei passi, ti viene voglia di ballare anche a te.   Saremmo ritornati al porto e nel Barrio Gotico la sera a mangiare...   Al porto puoi mangiare quella paella che tanto  famosa, quanto spesso  deludente...   Vi assicuro che la padellona con il riso, pesce e carne in mezzo a quattro persone finisce vereamente subito e non perch c' poca roba da mangiare...   Nel barrio gotico trovi localini (di quelli 'gnoranti) dove ti servono jamon e queso (prosciutto e formaggio) a tocchetti con un vinello rosso niente male... I localini sono veri e la vista dei prosciutti appesi alla parete... spettacolare.   Ma la visita  appena iniziata: non si pu dimenticare la parte artistica della citt...da dove inizio?   intanto per chi  appassionato di pittura il museo Picasso  eccezionale!!! E' costituito da una collezione permanente e una collezione variante di anno in anno...perci vi ritorno ogni volta... A parte che si possono trovare dipinti di tutti i periodi di Picasso, una stanza mi colpisce particolarmente, quella che contiene pi di una decina din versioni del rifacimento "picassiano" della meninas di Velasquez!!!   Della Fondazione Mir ho gi parlato e quindi vi rimando a quella lettura ... Ma la Barcellona artistica  soprattutto la Barcellona di Gaud: non posso non incamminarmi ogni volta (sempre partendo da placa de la Catalunya) per il Paseig de Gracia e fare la mia capitina a mirare la casa Batll (la mia preferita) e proseguire per la casa Mil.   Inoltre  d'obbligo passare un p di tempo al Parc Guell, spettacolare come tutte le architetture di Gaud.   Le prime due volte che sono stato a Barcellona non sono entrato dentro la Sagrada Familia... "bellissima da fuori ma dentro, mi dicevo,  vuota!!!". Ignorante che non sono altro!!! La pi grande opera incompiuta di Gaud  ancora in costruzione ed entrarvi dentro  emozionantissimo ed istruttivo visto che sono riportati i progetti, i modellini della chiesa...e poi, quando sono andato io, stavano chiudendo una parte... Dentro la chiesa troverete tutte le spiegazioni del perch delle guglie e dei significati di ogni piccolo particolare...da non perdere...   Bene,  l'ora di un piccolo break... a Paseig de Gracia vi consiglio un posticino, si chiama TAPA TAPA...le Tapas, gli stuzzichini degli spagnoli, tartine, antipasti, salumi, pesce, da ordinare e consumare in compagnia...ma se siete di fretta (di cose da vedere ce ne sono ancora) non mancheranno posti dove prendere al volo un Boccadillo (panino) caldo o freddo che sia...   Andiamo a fare una bella gita al Montjuic, prendiamo la metropolitana quant' bella e quante linee...) ed arriviamo al porto di nuovo... Prendiamo la teleferica (il Transbordador Aeri) ed saliamo, saliamo... che bella vista dalla teleferica, che bella vista dal miramar.. Sul Montjuic trovate il Castillo de Montjuic (con relativo museo militare... ma non ci sono entrato), parco di divertimenti ed il famoso Poble Espanyol.   Nel Poble Espanyol trovate "la piccola spagna"...case vere in tutti gli stili spagnoli.   La casa di Madrid, di Granada, quella basca e quelle andaluse di Siviglia e Cordoba...   Il poble espanyol  fatto per i turisti, pieno di negozi di souvenir...meno vero della Barcellona che avete gi visto, ma comunque per chi non  mai stato a Barcellona, un salto  d'obbligo!!!   Sono volati i vostri giorni a Barcellona? Avete i piedi che vi fanno male? Peccato che non avete visto tutto...ad esempio manca la Plaza de Espanya con la plaza de Toros e la Domenica la Plaza Real con il mio amato mercatino del collezionismo...ma magari ci tornerete un'altra volta...come me!!!|`|e867118edeb890ad97c21dfda1353063aa	budapest  Ciao da http://www.studioconsulenzaromano.net|`|cfc02dce77481965a7e5cd42c38fdc5daa	Londra....ancora legata alle vecchie tradizioni,alla monarchia,al t in ogni momento della giornata e considerato come panacea di tutti i mali, "Harrodd's" dove puoi comprare di tutto....e tanto altro!

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	As already stated, Palm Springs is in the desert roughly 120 miles east of Los Angeles. It gets well over 100 degrees most of the summer.    Since you stated that you husband was being relocated i am assuming that he has a guaranteed job waiting for him. California has been hit harder by the recession than most other states. If you are planning on working too you may find getting a job extremely difficult.     Remember that you will be coming to one of the most expensive, and heavily taxed states so prepare for your cost of living to increase.    It along with a few neighboring cities is rather isolated from the other parts of SoCal, but you have much to enjoy there.  In the 50's-80s it was the playground of the rich and famous so you will find lots of good restaurants, shopping , and entertainment. There are several Native casinos  on the near by reservations. It is at the foothills of the San Jacinto mountains, and you may enjoy riding the tramway to the summit. There is a large shopping outlet at nearby Cabazon. Finally it can get very windy there, but if you're from Chicago I guess that won't bother you.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Palm Springs is a rather large area, which includes many cities such as Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Palm Desert, Indio, etc. It is located in the Coachella Valley. Wikipedia can give you a pretty nice overview of the area. The stereotype is that it's a bunch of old rich people. However, the reality is that there is a wide variety of people living out there, with a very large percentage of retirees. There are LOTS of places to eat and shop, plenty of schools, shops, etc. There are theaters, a few clubs, and other entertainment. A lot of the restaurants are on Highway 111. I would suggest asking some of your neighbors for restaurant recommendations. I like the Fleming's in Rancho Mirage, LG's, or Morton's for steak. They have a huge shopping center at Monterey Ave at I-10, where they have a Costco and everything else.    Needless to say, it's blistering hot in summer. You'll appreciate the dry heat, though, coming from Illinois. Winters are very mild. You can see snow in the mountains without ever having to shovel it from your driveway.     Good luck.

There was a common scam I saw where this woman would walk around selling teddy bears to guys to give to their "dates" for like $10. You'd see the same toys every other day. It took e a while to figure out that the girls would sell the toys back for about half price of what it would sell for.      Best to find someone to take it with them on a plane and meet her in a bar or hotel.

dgRTkccBaa	Long Island is a completely different way of life than New York City is. On long Island you really need a car, in Manhattan it's more trouble than it's worth.  The public transportation on Long Island is not great.  Long Island is mostly suburbs and strip malls.  If you're looking for something in between, Queens which is borough of NYC is a little less densely populated than Manhattan, but not quite as suburban as LI is.  The public transportation is also pretty good in Queens.|`|AA12198724	Long Island is in New York. Do you mean New York City. Its totally different. Long Island is laden with suburbs and New York City has a lot more apartment complexes and skyscrapers.

It puts you right near Rockefeller Center & the Good Morning America show too.  Do the double decker Greyline bus tour for at least one day ~ it's a great way to get to know the city.  Get the package that takes you on a ferry around the Statue of Liberty ~ it is so beautiful!  You can take a 2 hr PhotoTrek tour which is personalized just for you and you get your picture taken all over the city and through some of Central Park (a must see).  The PhotoTrek guide also teaches you how to use the subway which is awesome!   The Wax Museum is fun for a laugh and more photos.  We went to the Top of the Rock and had AMAZING views of the city.  Also check out the performer line up for Good Morning American and the Today show.  We actually saw Beyonce for free in concert at Rockefeller Center.  There's so much to do in NYC, just remember to wear REALLY comfortable shoes because you'll be walking A LOT :).  Have a wonderful trip.|`|YIp9Q2DYaa	Some things you can do in NYC are go to Rockefeller Center and go ice skating. Also, 34th Street is AmAzInG! I loved it.

hIpmNBTjaa	i would stay at the airport for one thing, because  then you have to rent a car and you dont want to deal with a city that you are not familiar with, you could get lost or miss your flight.    at DIA, you can eat a sit down meal, a  quick meal, shop or window shop, they have a bath and body works, etc. a lot of really cool stores. also, buy a couple magazines, and read, bring a book, go to the bathroom, walk around and look at art, etc.     dont worry time will fly! lol no pun intended. have a great spring break.|`|wFBVuBOkaa	The airport is actually really cool, as others have said. Shopping, eating, art galleries, museum and history exhibits, etc. When you consider that 4 of your eight hours minimum are going to be taken up by security and getting to and from Denver (the airport is actually pretty far away), you may as well just stay there.|`|0d811LEXaa	Your better off to stay at the airport, there is absolutely nothing around the airport.  Your looking into at least an hour to two hours to get to anywhere that is remotely interesting such as downtown or the museums.    Bring your laptop, DIA has free WIFI throughout the airport and they have places where you can even plug in electronics in to charge all over the place.  Some good places to eat, It is a huge airport, you can sit and ride the shuttle around the whole thing, watch the plains come and go.  Yea I know 8 hours sucks but it is one of the best airports in the country.      Could be worse though, I was stuck in Hong Kong for a night, and there airport was boring with nothing to do.    Good luck and enjoy spring break.|`|l6yHfjBNaa	Well, it's about a a 40 minute drive to downtown Denver, so I'd say you should go there. You could go to Elitch Gardens for a few hours. . lol.. It's a theme park, so I don't know if you would have enough time.  Other than that just go downtown and eat at a restaurant. There's the Aquarium.. you could go there. .|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Okay.  APRIL is the snowiest month.    Elitches doesn't open full time until JUNE, but it isn't open at all until May, (weekends)    And you don't have to rent a car, you can take a cab.    But I still wouldn't recommend leaving the airport...security and all.  You just don't know what is going to happen.  You're better off.  And there's plenty of shopping and eating to be done in the airport.  Just wander around, get a little exercise, browse the shops, have a starbucks, or a drink, and a treat...lots of eateries.|`|rSq790ksaa	Unfortunately, nothing. The airport has a few shops to look around in but nothing to amuse you for 8 hours. The airport is very far away from civilization basically. I would just stick it out.|`|AA10216571	Take a nap. I'll take you an hour to get to downtown Denver, an hour back and who knows how long to get through security again. I suppose you could walk the 16th street mall  in downtown.Then there's the weather. March is our snowiest month. If it's snowing  it would be a bad idea to leave the airport. It's a tough call.
oMTsDcNBaa	1-2 days in these locations is NOT enough time to enjoy these places so I only recommend visiting two or three places. Seriously? 6 cities in 10 days?|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	That's a lot of road time in a week.  Any of the major spots you are visiting can be a week long (or more) destination in itself.  So, you won't get much of an experience in any of them - sort of a very very quick survey.      All things considered, assuming you are over 21, I'd just fly into Vegas, stay there for a few days, hit LA for a few days, hit San Diego for a few days.  If you had extra time, I'd highly suggest Death Valley and especially the Grand Canyon, but seeing as you don't, it's a lot of miles for not a lot of time there.  The Grand Canyon especially should be a destination rather than a pit stop.  Given your schedule, you just really don't seem to have time for it.|`|6fanRjFaaa	on your drive up to grand canyon, drive into sedona and then take highway 89A up to flagstaff.  the red rock drive is awesome.
tmkc9UPMaa	well im from mexico and im really glad you are going to visit my country and well im from mexico city but i ve gone to cancun twice and i would recommend the Mayan Palace it Is a great resort and it has all you need and you dont need to worry about the food in all the hotels of cancun they will have vegetarian food although its a shame you can not prove the meat because its really awesome here   And dont forget to vist the Xcaret and if you got time go to the pyramids well the pyramids are not located in cancun but you can take an excursion  i m sorry if you dont understand my english is not good enough  and lt me give you the link of the hotel i told you  http://www.grupomayan.com/mayan-palace/  P.S There are too many great hotels here i recommended you this one because its the one i ve visited but its full of hotels we got the sheraton, hilton etc.  Enjoy it and thank you for visiting MEXICO  Well i saw you read my answer and well im going to give you the link of the official page of cancun in english  And well the best places in cancun are, Xcaret, Tulum, Playa del Carmen,Chichenitza  l im sure that in every  hotel they have a map of the touristic places and they can give you all the information you need they also arrange the excursions to the pyramids so enjoy it and well thank s  http://www.cancun.com/  and this is a link of information of cAncun of wikipediA  I DIDNT UNDERSTAND the whole thing that appears in wikipedia so i hope it says good things  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancn  bye|`|ZsLHITEYaa	The Iberstar hotels in the area are the best. I'm from Cancun and I find they have excellent service, great facilities, and pretty good prices.  They are in the Riviera Maya, between Playa del Carmen and Cancun. The cities are about an hour from eachother. I'd say it's a half hour from the Cancun airport to the Iberostar. They have great tour options!  http://www.iberostarresorts.com/  BTW. The food won't cause you problems.|`|Al4xzacyaa	Don't spoil your anniversary going to Mexico. . .stomach disorders and gunfights by the drug dealing cartels, unpleasant resort staff with a hand out for everything.

3370414ab4774aa3e1185710272832ffaa	Noi eravamo indecisi tra la West Coast americana (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Gran Canyon ecc...) e Bali. Abbiamo scelto Bali perch avevamo solo due settimane a disposizione e il tour che volevo fare in America diventava un corsa... ho pensato che dopo il matrimonio era bello anche rilassarsi un po' (anche e non siamo amanti di mare e relax). Sono stata contentissima... Bali  un'isola bellissima e i balinesi sono sempre sorridenti, sono gentili ed ospitali. Tutti cercano di chiaccherare un po' in tutte le lingue, sorridono e salutano sempre! Il mare di Bali  bello ma non stupendo, abbiamo fatto diverse esursioni nei vari Templi (tutti stupendi) e nella parte centrale dell'isola (abbiamo fatto rafting, e treking nella jungla). Gli ultimi 4 giorni ci siamo spostati in un'isoletta l vicino: si chiama Gili Trawangan. E' stato un paradiso per noi! E' un'isola corallina, quindi il mare  bellissimo e  pieno di pesci coloratissimi anche a riva. L'isola  piccolissima (si fa il giro dell'isola in mezz'ora di bici) e solo una parte  abitata. Non ci sono n macchine n motori ( i taxi sono carrozze trainate da cavallini), ma la parte abitata di gira tranqillamente a piedi. Ci sono solo 2 alberghi, quello dove eravamo noi era di propriet di un italiano che ci ha accolto come fratelli! Lungo la stada (lungomare) ci sono un sacco di barettini, pub e risorantini e ogni sera c' una festa in uno questi. A queste feste sono tutti giovani, si fa festa insieme, turisti da tutto il mondo e abitanti dell'isola. Siamo stati davvero benissimo!

It really depends on what your interests are, but I would look at a Chicago tourism site.|`|AA11102769	There is an indoor water park in Erie PA that is supposed to be pretty cool. My friend & her son (your age) went there, and had a great time.|`|9b6c2715c64af15c57a8f2f4c378b5a2aa	Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA has great rides. It takes ten hours to get there from Ohio. Check at BuschGardens.com to make sure that it is open in March. Part of the park is a mock-up of 1500's Europe. The rest is rides. Your dad would probably like the beer at OktoberFest. Take Hwy 35 from Chillicothe to Charleston, WV. Take I-64 to Williamsburg, VA. It takes exactly ten hours.    KingsDominion.com is another theme park with rides. The website has a link called Other Parks. There are at least 10 parks there - some closer to Ohio. They may not be open in March because it is still cold. Still, these theme parks have lots of rides like Disney World. You ought to be bugging your dad to take you once a summer.
Gezfmghuaa	The average cost for an overnight camp right now is approximately $6000 for 8 weeks or more.   I know of absolutely none in the $250 per week range, unless its something sponsored by a church (and even then the price would be higher in most cases.  Back in 2003, 1 week at a church sponsored event was $450.    Day camp might a bit more doable if you drop your requirement for field trips as part of the price (those are expensive to do).  Many YMCAs, JCCs, etc operate some more reasonable options.|`|BlKSDPToaa	Forget overnight camp. The YMCAs offer nice day camps and might be affordable for you. Don't know where you are but the Upper Main Line YMCA in Berwyn is wonderful.|`|NT4r4hnKaa	i dont know of any camps there,,im from the usa,500.00 is not enough for two weeks.you might try ? www.KOA CAMPGROUNDS.COM

mv0IKzEUaa	"In fact he saved the taxpayer many hundreds of thousands of dollars" What! the islanders in South Auckland are fleecing the taxpayer everyday but no one even brings that up otherwise it will be considered "racist".|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	No not really.  He got what he deserved|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	No, he's insane and would have cost the tax payers hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit in prison for the rest of his life.

I mean God bless his soul and all; he was obviously in one heck of a messed up head space, but more than anything, I think his victims will be so relieved that it's the end of a bad chapter in their lives.

Even his partner didnt care.|`|cLJT3yZNaa	No. In fact he saved the taxpayer many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

And he had another appeal he was going to lodge shortly.|`|793OI1W6aa	I have no sympathy for that man. That's probably the first time he's done what's right in his life.

Something is wrong there.|`|rzm5avBUaa	I think the new zealand justice system should put in place procedures to make sure this doesnt happen. being under sucide watch should mean 24hours 7days a week!!! he was sucidual and a very evil man yet he should have paid his dues by doing his time.

1Vih78dZaa	It doesn't have "3km" in the name, but the Via del Cappuccini (more prosaically known as the SS17) between L'Aquila and Sulmona has a notably straight section that's over 3km long and it does match the rest of your description.    We live in Abruzzo, but on the other side of the mountains from Sulmona. I can't claim to know the area around Sulmona particularly well since we don't get over that way all that often, so there may be other similar roads in the area. However, I have been down the SS17 a few times and it does stick in my mind.    If you have Google Earth, try putting 4204'08.41"N 1355'20.53"E in the "Fly to" box.
AA10042296	Tulum was a major Maya trading center on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, which bartered goods from all over the Maya world.

Search for Riviera Maya or check out more Tulum websites
c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	If you go to Berlin, you will see the Berlin flag a lot (the one with the bear). At least on official buildings, there are flags hoisted the year over. Just because Bavaria is most famous and always is good for pretty pictures for the news that doesn't mean that in other federal states they don't have flags or hoist and wave them. -- Sure, we Bavarians are being a little bit proud of being Southerners and doing things our own way, but we're Germans all the same and wouldn't leave the Union for just a slight incident. But maybe we're a little bit prouder than other Germans because we could if we wanted. The separate constitution that was granted to us when the Federal Republic was founded gives us the right of independence from the Republic if 2 3rds of the Bavarian population voted for it. (It would need a major revolution to achieve that, but it's the law. So the Feds treat us softly...)    You may be right, therefore, that in Bavaria, the Bavarian flag waves more often side by side with the federal flag than it does in other states.|`|CHW99LTQaa	Great answer Alwin I couldn't agree more|`|64IEjXOBaa	Many Germans believe in a strong regional identity before believing in being German.|`|YvpG26Pmaa	Bavaria is a state with in Germany. It was originally a separate kingdom, until 1871 when Germany was united into an empire under Prussian dominance. Then after WWI the kingdom became a socalist republic for a short time, and then became a state in republian Germany.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Germany is, much like the United States, a collection of reatively indepenant states, all with their own governments and parliaments. Unlike the US though, these states have historically in the past been indepenant principalities.|`|y18plL5Daa	I am from Bavaria but I am also from Germany. I love Bavaria but I also love Germany.

hBBQZ6yDaa	Russians follow the European dress code, they/we always like to look good, take good care of ourselves, and high heels and a mini are always in in Russia:) I personally hate how most American women dress - baggy shorts and shirts, flip-flops, I actually saw in U.S. several times women in the food stores wearing hair curlers, and a shower cap over them....wow, how sexy:)))|`|BWxSSADaaa	A Continental climate (i.e. Europe) means cold, depressing winters and pretty nice, warm summers.  After a cold and crappy winter, summer feels pretty awesome, and who wouldn't want to wear a mini-skirt?  Especially if you've got the legs (and a nice body in general) to go along with it.    With young attractive women, I think you'll find that mini-skirts are popular everywhere.  And ... I'm willing to bet that the young attractive women are the ones you noticed.  So, sure, there are many Russian women not wearing those skirts, you probably just notice them less, like everyone else.  Consequently, there are less photos of them on the internet.  If you actually go there, I think you won't see girls clad in short skirts to the extent that you see on the internet, even if the "scenery" is nice anyway.|`|OIREN5Jeaa	Unlike most americans they walk everywhere. So they typically have nice legs to show off ;o)|`|tfotPdeZaa	because they are fun to wear, the look nice, and ifs it hot out, why wear long pants?|`|P2UHQQehaa	because russian women have nice, long legs. so, why not flaunt them when it's warm out?
JQa86WoVaa	Guatemala is beautiful everywhere, but especially Antigua, and Pana or lake Atitlan. The beaches are nice too, however, the cities and beaches can be dirty and the riptides can be pretty nasty. The beach is awesome because it is tropical and you can tell. On your drive to the beach you can just stop on the side of the road and buy fresh fruit, coconuts, anything. Amazing!! Antigua is a quaint, colonial city and there are many small towns with indigenous people. It's amazing and colorful. Anyway, like the other person said, anywhere jungle, near the ocean, Tikal etc. yes, get anti-malarial medicine if you are in lake atitlan or antigua or anywhere else in the higher altitude, no you won't need it. Have fun|`|I9Qp0wF6aa	Beautiful green country with lots of animal life although the country is going throught a little bit of a problem which is called Poverty. I did see some rich folks down there but the majority were poor. When I use the word poor I mean poor. The country is a nice place to visit if you are into in wild life and in seek of adventure.|`|AA10986891	www.visitguatemala.com|`|xiMnj4f4aa	Fantastic.    Depends on where you are going in Guatemala.  If you are going to the Jungle in Peten, you should probably get all your shots.  If you are going to Antigua and Lake Atitlan, you probably don't need them.
PSiNv7gUaa	By liquid hand wash, are you talking about waterless hand sanitizer gel?  If so, then yes, you may take a travel-sized bottle (I did).  It will have to go in the one-quart ziploc baggie they give you.  They will not allow opened containers of baby food.  I had baby bottles with water in them to make bottles, and they made me dump them.  They said only pre-made bottles were allowed.  Talcum powder should be no biggie.|`|daBtvDv7aa	no but powder yes.. theres soap why do you need liquid hand wash?|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	contact the airline you are traveling with. they will tell you all the info you need.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	See site below for TSA info on baby needs you can take.  For your hands, just use baby wipes as towelettes..works great.|`|VeLhLlulaa	Look on the web site of the airline, there you will find all information for the allowed things you can take on board the aircraft.
cR7Sf4cjaa	Heck yes.  You can get a 2nd degree burn from the sun in Alaska during the summer.    Two reasons.  First, during the summer more of the sun's ray's are concentrate on the far northern part of the planet.  At noon time the front of my home (Fairbanks Area) easily hit's 120F and if we are not careful will kill any house plants put out in the morning.    Second - the atmosphere in Alaska is thinner - this happens at both ends of the poles.  This thinner atmosphere means fewer harmful rays are filtered and translates into a much stronger sun striking your body.    Sure, Ketchikan gets a ton of rain - but on a nice sunny day the place is wonderful, beautiful, and if you don't have sunscreen - painful!    hope this helps|`|PiSff4dzaa	no. it rains alot !

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, just go down into the subway and have the token clerk transfer the money from the old card to a new one. He or she will gladly do it for you, no questions asked.    Good luck|`|eVK2zZsOaa	It is probably too late to do anything but I would just ask. I would contact the MTA or ask one of the booth attendents. It just expired so it is not like it is years old. No use in letting $18 go to waste.|`|AA12198724	Most likely not. Just let it go. If you bend the metrocard a certain way you get a free ride so booth attendants can not give refunds under any circumstances.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	Yes, you can get this transferred to a new card at any attended station.

The only people I know who have a big problem with the police are criminals, and that's how it should be.    My concerns are that they don't investigate all the crimes, so that criminals are allowed to get away with breaking the law, and that so few police actually live in Liverpool but out in the suburbs.    How can you police a community you have no stake in?    In general though, most police I have met are trying to do a job in difficult circumstances, and the only criticism I hear is from the criminals they are locking up.|`|wFRe80HHaa	Do you mean the place or the police?|`|O71xlcG3aa	If the police are not doing there jobs then the people who run the police should get the flack.

AA12198724	If you go to school go to the Job Center there. If not then you can join a Workforce Center and sit through a two week program and they will do free career placement. I went to my school and had a career counselor help me apply for certain jobs after I was let go from my last job after thanksgiving. Also I had a resume on careerbuilder.com and I got a phone call from Beacon Theater asking me to come in for an interview. Also I responded to an ad from craigslist.org and I got a job. SO technically I have three jobs at the moment because I said yes to all the ones that made me an offer but I have to wait for the background checks to go through and whatnot. If you look on craigslist.org be careful because a few of them are pyramid schemes or scams to steal your identity. Stay away from the customer service reps and mystery shoppers jobs and ones that send you to a different application because they try to get your information or wire them money.

pn2QRgAJaa	Portland, Maine area. Scarborough, Maine, which is close to Portland, is really nice and it's beautiful. it has tons of beaches which are great to go to all year long! Cape Elizabeth, Maine is also great! just like scarborough! =] Have Fun!!!|`|lys5kB9Daa	i went to college in western mass (UMASS) and i personally think it is soooo boring out there. not the college, that was a blast, but you're obviously not going to the college! there are barely any restaurants or things to do, its just like woods and mosquitos. if you are into that then ok but i personally hate it.  the cape is pretty nice, but you are right it can be pricey. i have only stayed at my grandparents house in Sandwich, never a hotel, but there are so many deals going on now with the economy. there are beaches, boardwalks, biking/walking path along the canal, great seafood..  boston in itself is pretty awesome, but might not be as relaxing as you want.  i personally think Maine, NH, and Vermont are all extremely boring as they are similar to western Mass.  You could go to Hampton Beach in NH, its like a mini version of myrtle beach or virginia beach, it's got lots of cheap little hotels and a strip of shops, or Misquamicut beach in Rhode island its pretty cheap and laid back beach environment there. The ocean water is still pretty cold in the summer though because it's the north atlantic but plenty of people swim in it.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	If you like beaches you might want to try Provincetown, on the tip of the Cape. it is a funky town with all sorts of shops and restaurants and near some nice beaches, one of the nicest is Coast Guard Beach in nearby Eastham, though P-town has it's own excellent beaches.There are trips through the dunes you can take, though most of the dunes are off limits due to erosion and nesting birds|`|V6asuaxuaa	Check out western Massachusetts - the Berkshires.

If you like the city, there's no place like Boston.|`|26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	I think that Cape Cod is one of the best places to visit. There are lots of beaches and museums. You could venture to Plymouth, Ma a very important town in our history. You should definately check out boston, go on the duck tour, swan boats, children's musuesm, sci musuem, aquarium, so many things to do especially in the summer. Everything is easy to get to and it's not bad city to walk in. If you go to the city get a hotel for two nights then go to cc for the rest of the week, stopping at Plymouth on the way down. Try Chatham its got great beaches. good luck with red sox tix tho you wont get any! mv and nan. are ridic expensive it would be good for a day trip

I did one price check and the fares came up $1186 round trip.  My wife used a consolidated flight agency and she only paid $1195 from Manilla to Cebu (she is there now).  Also, call travel agencies in Chicago, IL.  They have the most competitve rates in the country.  Don't pay top price $1500-$1700 like most people do.  There are better deals out there!  Good luck

9QBlKlFmaa	One way that is popular among Arabs living in Judea and Samaria (the "West Bank") is to marry an Israeli.  This gives them Israeli citizenship automatically.    Anyone who claims that only Jews can get Israeli citizenship is either ignorant or a liar.  (Or both.)  Some 20 percent of Israeli citizens are not Jewish!    That is the answer to the first question.    Regarding Palestinian passports, there is no such thing.  Jordan issues Jordanian passports, Syria issues Syrian passports, Egypt issues Egyptian passports and Israel issues Israeli passports.    But Jordan has a majority of Arabs who are regarded as Palestinians, so there should be no trouble for all people who so regard themselves to move to Jordan, and thereby to express their national aspirations.      .|`|HJaVcUGwaa	Can a Palestinian born in the West Bank gain Israeli citizenship?   No.  Israel gives citizenship only to Jews, people who have Jewish mothers and people married to Jewish Israelis.  The racist right of return allows any Jews from anywhere in the world to get Israeli citizenship, but it does not allow native Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from Israel/Palestine to set foot on their country again, let alone having citizenship.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_retu...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee Pal...    Do West Bank and Gazan Palestinians have Palestinian passports?  Yes.  They carry Palestinian authority passports.  These passports are recognized worldwide, including Israel.  Issuing a Palestinian authority passport requires Israeli approval, as the West Bank and Gaza Strip are still under Israeli occupation.    As for Palestinians living in Diaspora (outside Palestine), they are not allowed to carry Israeli or Palestinian passports.  They hold travel documents from whichever counrty they live in.    Edit:  I do not know why some Zionists keep challenging the facts in my answers and forcing me to prove them wrong.  Why does the truth hurt so much?  The answer below refers to the 20% Arab Israelis who carry Israeli citizenship.  Those are the remaining Palestinians who were not ethnically cleansed in 1948.  Israel gave them citizenship after 1948.  That's it.  No other non-Jew can get Israeli citizenship except as I mentioned above.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_Clea...

That is very different from citizenship.  They can obtain an Istraeli passport, where they are defined, under "Nationality", as Arab, not Israeli. In fact the Nationality of anyone with an Israeli passport is defined by their ethnicity. So they are "Jewish", "Arab", "Druze", etc.  The conductor Daniel Barenboim is believed to be the only person in the world who holds both Israeli and Palestinian citizenship.  The Palestinian Authority issues passports for both the West Bank and Gaza. Though it seems Hamas, at least until recently, also issued passporrts for Gaza.    edit:  Tyreeism, please would you be so kind as to provide a source. I can't find anywhere that confirms your valuable information.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	non Jewish people can and do become citizens of Israel|`|xUDPwUdIaa	actually, i know a Palestinian born in Gaza who got Israeli citizenship. it took him a looooooooooooooooooooong time though.  first he came and lived illegally in Israel for several years (in his early teens). then Israel sent him back to Gaza where he was arrested and tortured for six months because he wanted to be Israeli. then he came back to Israel for a few years (illegally again). got arrested and went to court and said he wanted to be Israeli. the judge sympathized with him and granted him residency. then he converted to Judaism and is now a full citizen. this process started when he was 13 and finished at 26 (with the conversion).  look him up his name is Amnon Yitzchak Shachar, they did a lot of articles on him. i think there are some in English too.    but in general, i would say it is almost impossible. my friend is a very rare exception  Palestinians in the west bank and Gaza have Palestinian Authority passports i think|`|emJ79qagaa	They are not even allowed to leave the West Bank.

It highway the whole way there.  No scary one lane roads...not even once you get in the park.  It depends on what you mean by "on the side of the mountain" because you will have to drive on the outside lane of some roads that are in the mountains but it is perfectly safe and not scary.  Worth the drive because it is amazing there.  PS-there is a hike just outside of Yosemite (though technically it is considered in the park) called Wapama Falls.  You drive to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and it is about a 3 mile hike round trip but it is a fun relatively quite hike.  You get splashed by the waterfalls if you are going early enough in the summer.  I recommend looking into that hike.  It is about a half hour drive to the reservoir though so hopefully you have enough time to squeeze it in.

As for a Hotel,most require a credit card to secure a reservation,but the prepaid card is an option again.The hotel will make the reservation based on the card number,but will not bill the card until you check in,but if you pay every month one nights stay then the card will not be spent.(we make hotel reservations in January and each month from Feb til June we pay for a night so we have a paid off room for 5 nights when we get there).

Combine that each one has what appears to be around 75 folks plus some I don't see that gives you an idea of the crowd. Also keep in mind I'm sure there are quite a few that get together and get some more economy hotels.  I cannot comment on the beer prices as I don't attend. beer for the beach is $1 a piece at the local OXXO conv. store and ice at the front display cooler is free for your taking.  Blue buses run the whole Costera and are 4.50 pesos. No pick up or drop off - just yell and wave them down.  Many other secrets to this town if you need it - just e mail me.    Click on my profile and link over to find my Flicker link to what you will see and experience here in Acapulco.|`|m7DU6i6jaa	Neither..... Cancun is the best place for a spring break in Mexico.  Acapulco and Mazatlan are boring compared to Cancun.
w4sdVi11aa	Carnac Plage (Plage means 'beach' in French) in the Bretagne region has quite a nice beach if you like swimming in cold water in the summer.  But are you perhaps looking for a beach related to WWII and the landings in Normanday?  The code names for those 'D-day beaches' are: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword.|`|cjKPEHaFaa	All the ones in Normandy.|`|OQFSG3Ihaa	Omaha Beach, from a historic point of view probably the most famous beach in France.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Nice.|`|DfJAMulSaa	Saint - Jean de luz,     Not far from spain and is close to the pyranees. All year round surfing, so popular with young people as welll as old for the countryside    Its a small town in the heart of the basque country.    It is a very popular beach, highly commmened in brochures, hope this helps|`|LOWWquKkaa	It's a trick question - or perhaps one to test your research skills.  France has had no beaches since the sixteenth century.  The very last one they had was Canet Plage, on the south-western Mediterranean coast.  Try that one.
4vLt3SqFaa	All right here is what you do.  I love the Gettysburg battle field and go there often. There are many personal guides available for you at reasonable rates - inquire via the park office.  All guides are very knowledgeable and rigorously tested prior to being allowed to guide.  The problem for some is that the guides are too well versed and share too much detail.    You can easily guide yourself.  Go to the park office and get the audio tapes.  I suggest buying them - around 20 dollars as I recall.  They will guide you about the battlefield on a driving tour.  Before going get the book, THE KILLER ANGLES and read it.  Then get the movie Gettysburg based on the book, but read the book first!  Wear walking clothes.  While you can drive from site to site - walking is needed to gain a full understanding - especially in the area of Little Round top, Big Round top, Devil's Den and the High Water Mark.  Keep in mind that the battle field has grown up with many trees that were not there at the time of the battle.  The park service is going to begin a multi-year project to cut back some of this growth and try and restore a more historical look.    The park is ideal for bringing a picnic lunch.  It can be "very" hot in the summer.  A few other things to keep in mind.  Gettysburg is split into two parts - the area north of town where the first day of battle was fought and the other two days about the high ground south of the town.  The spilt nature makes some visitors miss half the park.  Start at the visitors center which was newly restored in a very unique partnership with private groups that raised the 40 million dollars.       When walking about the park there is a lot of wildlife including deer which leap out in front of cars all the time.  Turtles are a very common sight.  Nine types of snakes are in the park including copperheads and timber rattlesnake. Not something to be frightened of but simple to be aware of.  The Northern Water Snake is not venomous and is common in the streams of the park.  Its dark color and stout body often cause it to be mistakenly identified with the venomous water moccasin, which is not found in the park.  It is however much more agressive than the poisinous snakes and will stike repeatedly if it feels threatened.  I saw a watersnake in a park road when a car came by.  The driver very carefully straddled it so as to not harm the snake but the snake felt threatened and struck the underside of the car repeatedly as it passed slowly over.     If there is anything else I can help with please feel free to contact me via email|`|jLppTLOmaa	I would say it should only be a like long weekend stay.

NzHtbpfJaa	You will be fine .....    Australia is VERY multicultural.    Check out http://australian.lifetips.com for some pointers !|`|zVGhHomRaa	Australians and the like are intolerant, insensitive and ignorant. They possess an odd sense of humor and do not reciprocate on acts of kindness i.e. dinner (instead, they will invite you out for dinner and make you pay for your share).     They are also not inclined to criticism of any kind of their country, culture or customs. Even, if it's constructive criticism.    For instance, I once mentioned to my Australian friend that his government should conduct another referendum and if agreed, make a swift and decisive transition to a republic. I attempted to tell him my reasons, which in my opinion were valid and sound. However, he just walked away and gave me the cold shoulder. I concluded that,  Australians were and will never be up for a change even if it would benefit greatly and they are still loyal to a country which deserted them in a time of need (i.e.england, world war II).|`|NyJeK6NSaa	I advice you start with Melbourne. It would be a better choice for a person from cool climate.    http://www.planbooktravel.com.au|`|s2IOyj8iaa	You will be very welcome no matter where your from.

You'll have no problem fitting in, no matter who you are, or where you're from.    I'm a Linux loving WoW playing geek, and I'm best friends with a typical outback, horse-riding Australian girl and an Asian music genius.    Honestly, everyone fits in.    We're all so used to tourists... I've grown up with them everywhere. No one thinks twice about where you're from. =D|`|ETHhnhLxaa	you already asked this...

Australians are generally a warm, open and friendly lot. There are anomolies, but they usually get told to "pull their head in".     It would be helpful what pointers you are seeking. I'm assuming you are from the US.... Most negative stereotypes of US people include arrogance, loud talkers, and thinking the world revolves around them.

There's heaps to do - go to the opera, do the bridge climb, go to the beach, etc. You can go down to Melbourne for a shopping holiday, but there's not much else to do down there. For a beach holiday, you can stay in Sydney or go to the Gold Coast in Queensland, or go to the central or north coast of NSW or just go to Brisbane.|`|DmcZn0T8aa	Australia is like a second home to me and have always felt welcome there.

S6AjZ2uMaa	The Panama Canal is an important aspect of our assur Except for the large aircraft carriers, our Naval fleet can travel through the Canal, thus allowing our Naval planners a great deal of flexibility and versatility. Without the use of the Canal, the United States would need a larger ("two-ocean navy, larger storage and harbor facilities on both the East and West Coasts and provide additional merchant ships and escorts and fuel. Interocean mobility would be threatened, both for the United States and for our allies 111 Benefits to Panama Income generated by the Canal makes a large contribution to the Panamanian economy. During 1976 it included over $29 million generated in direct pur chases in Panama by U.S. government agencies; over $108 million in wages to non-US. citizens employed in the Zone; expenditures in Panama of U.S employees of over $39 million; and an annuity of over $2 million. The United States has contributed substantially in various ways to Panama's well-being.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Trade???|`|XWvD81COaa	If you were to sail from the Pacific to the Atlantic, think of how long it would take to go all the way around South America. The Canal cuts off a couple of weeks of travel time and many tons of fuel. It's extremely important to our navy and vital for world trade.
jq7TWEqfaa	sorry im in england :) x
zOyWCvqtaa	It really depends on the climate you are looking for as well.  Just about all along the east coast of Australia are towns of varying sizes which would have what you wish for.  Everything from tropical cyclone country in far north Queensland, down to temperate marine in Victoria.  The west coast of Australia has little in the way of population, but I've been told the immediate surrounds of Perth are beautiful for living in.  If you prefer cooler weather then Tasmania has a lot on offer and also has some of the cheapest housing in the country.  Keep in mind that many of these places are tourist spots as well so usually from December - Janurary and at times Feburary they will be brimming with tourists, even the small towns.  Just keep in mind that housing costs and job oppourtunities vary wildly between states and towns...and even by proximity to a major city.  For example many people on the Central and South coast of NSW are happy to commute the 1 - 2 hours to Sydney and house prices in those areas are on the increase.    From personal experience I find that Batemans Bay and surrounds on the south coast of NSW is a beautiful area to live, though it is growing.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	There's some excellent rural communities on the Sunshine Coast that have a great community spirit and are great for young families and aren't too overpriced:  Cooroy, Cooran, Kin Kin, Pomona - 20mins from Noosa.    Yandina, Eumundi - 10 mins from Peregian&Coolum Beaches  Palmwoods - 20/30mins from Alex Headlands/Mooloolaba  Maleny - 15/20min from Caloundra  I'd be living in Pomona now if my partner hadn't been transferred to Armidale.  It's awesome here too, but just over 2hrs to the beach.    You could pick pretty much anywhere along the NSW coast, just about all the coastal towns have nice outer/hinterland areas that are pretty rural.    I believe SW Australia is very nice too.|`|IIuafPfIaa	Wollongong.    Great beaches, great nightlife and all.|`|90tPT5nlaa	How about Coffs Harbour or Ulladulla, or there are many more places, particularly along the NSW coast.|`|uldindq5aa	definitely somewhere along the great ocean road in victoria. i live in land from there and it is great.  not too hot in the summer and not too crazy either with tourists. nice smaller coastal towns, nice people..  definitely don't go for the gold coast or sunshine coast, it's far too hectic to be there full time too many people..  great ocean road area is quite rural too, start heading in land and there is a lot of farms, particularly dairy farms.. it's a really nice area..  good luck|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Cooroy is awesome
chdszaRKaa	Many... many... I don't know who tell you that, but it's not true, "some" would be OK. Concerning B&B it's a bit more of British owners maybe, yes, but not for Cafs and tourist centres. So it's better if you speak a little bit of french or just try to. Anyway, you will always find someone OK to speak english with you, so don't worry, but trying to speak french will always a good point for you (don't forget it).|`|I3CNklLKaa	Not really - Brittany used to be part of Britain. Mention it while you're there, they love hearing about it.|`|0xdKGMX7aa	I lived in France for 4 years and in my experience the French consider it good etiquette for any visitor to speak their language. Your efforts will be much appreciated. There may be many english people in the area, and if you are looking to be able to speak english, do a search on the web for brits in brittany and british bed and breakfasts. But for day to day stuff you will need to know some basics.     Make sure to practise you new found language out loud. It doesn't work if you speak a new language in your head.    Before I went to live there I had little sticky labels on everything :))|`|8jfP349iaa	Britanny is in France! People speak french not english and they hate when tourists dont even try to speak the language.|`|4Cu4EQPaaa	Don't come to FRANCE if you want to speak English, or if you want the people to be British.    tsss|`|c2c7a5700a2d44609d3cdf659c65a995aa	The Breton people are among the friendliest people you could ever wish to meet but they are also very proud of their heritage. Quite a number of them speak the Breton language which (I am told) resembles Welsh or Cornish.  Why would you expect a French person to speak to you in English?  Do you expect to speak to foreign visitors to your town in their language?  I don't suppose so!!  In the good old days, when schools  actually educated their students, most secondary children learned French. My last French lesson was in 1954 but I still remember enough to speak French when I'm on holiday there. Sometimes I make mistakes (I suspect my French is rather like the policeman in Hallo!  Hallo!) but the French don't seem to mind. Many French people in holiday areas, such as Brittany, can speak English - but why should they?  Book yourself into some evening classes and learn some basic French. I tell you, it is very satisfying when you try to use it and it works.
Yj7kMfv7aa	June sounds a perfect time to visit, it is not as cold as you would be use to...

There are more days with very light winds in June than in any other month. It is also the foggiest month. Fog usually forms in the late evening and clears by mid-morning, occasionally it may persist for most of the day. Many days are cloudy, June being the cloudiest month of the year. Nights are cold with occasional frosts, mostly in the outer suburbs, the lowest temperature for the month in the city usually being about 2oC. Rain falls on one day in two and sometimes it is in the form of drizzle in the morning which clears to a fine day. Heavy rain is rare.    i live in melbourne and have all my life...

bda465ikaa	If you are really strapped for cash, then stay with all the other students at the 800 person Generator Hostel in Bloomsbury. That' about as cheap as you can get, and it's within walking distance of King's Cross. If you can get a 2 person room it is 25GBP apiece and includes a continental breakfast.  ===============  Imperial hotels are very inexpensive. They are in Bloomsbury so they are not real close to the center.  = If you have a little more money, the Strand Palace Hotel is in a better location. The single rooms are fairly cheap, but they are like barracks.  = An inexpensive walkup with a very very central location is the Royal Adelphi. It is on a side street next to Charing Cross rail station.  = Travel Lodge in covent garden is pretty good.  = Premier Travel Inn in County Hall is usually booked, but it's right next to the London Eye.  ==============|`|RrEESD6Paa	The prices of hotels in London vary quite often, so I would concentrate on searching as many sites as possible.

Antes que nada, no es nuestra intension molestar a las personas con cosas de esas. Pues como te dijeron, es para identificarnos todos los Colombianos. Realmente no parecia que fuera tan molestoso, Creo que nos hacemos sentir mas orgullosos de donde venimos.

958EXZEhaa	That's not enough time to leave the airport and then go back.    If you have little more time you could of maybe go to the Jersey Gardens mall - its about 5-10 min ride in a cab from the airport.  Its a huge mall.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, there not much you can do in two and half hour. You're going on a international flight, so you have to be at the airport in order to go through security.    Good luck|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	not much. it takes too much time to go anywhere and back. you might as well stay at EWR, read a book, be on Wi-Fi, and eat something...|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I don't think you'll have time to leave the airport and go anywhere, honestly.|`|DpvXEd3Naa	keep your white butt in there and read something|`|1FPpglMpaa	I must agree, you won't have any time.  You have to check in 2 hours before an int'l flight and to get through the sometimes long security lines.|`|36828d8d67f53aa3b80f099a8455b0eeaa	Well, EWR is a very small airport with very good security. So, grab a bite to eat, pick up a good book or bring your iPod and just wait. The time it takes to get through security leaves you very little time to play with. Welcome to America and have a safe flight.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	It's an international flight - by the time you get in from Philly, if you wanted to leave, you would have to turn around and go right back in.  Remember, international flights board an hour before departure time - not the standard half an hour like domestic flights.  Besides, there's nothing to do in Newark, you definitely wouldn't have enough time to get to Manhattan via the PATH, and it's the middle of winter.  Stay in EWR, it's a pretty big airport with plenty of stuff to spend your money on, and watch the planes land.  Or bring a book.

Many of the desirable places are expensive. An up and coming area is the St John's area outside of Portland, and the prices are still fairly reasonable.|`|W4IOLSzbaa	Goose Hollow if you're a student South West is under rated it's walking distance to the Roseland and Pioneer Square|`|fb17a4f3434f8253251d5408b1f1b4d8aa	Depends on how much you want to spend on rent or a house.  SW near or just in Tigard. It is near 12 bus that goes all over the city.  Quiet yet you can hop on the bus and be downtown in no time.  Drive into the happening areas in 7-10 min.

These are fairly close by and the rates will be a bit lower than they would be in Summer.    For a REAL treat, and if you and your friends don't mind a few hours travel, you'll find the rates in the TAHOE area relatively lower because the Spring and Fall periods are the "low" season up there.   Most of the snow is either gone or not yet arrived and it is not as warm as it gets in Summer.  But with a snug cabin and a hot tub available, who cares?    Just do a Google search for "Lake Tahoe Cabins" and you'll find LOTS of hits for you to research.  A LOT of people who own vacation property up there will hire a "manager" to rent out their places when the owners aren't using it.
S4W3sv3iaa	You will find wine tasting in the northern part of San Diego County around Escondido.  One of my favorites is Orfila Vineyards which is off of I-15 on the way to the Wild Animal Park.  They have lots of great wines.  You can get a coupon to taste for free at this site:  http://www.cheers2wine.com.  There are also around 6 wineries in the Ramona/Julian area that are fun.  Julian is a small historic mining town with unique shops.  It's known for its apple pies.    Also near Julian is a hike where you can swim under a waterfall.  It's the Cedar Falls Hike.  For directions visit:  http://www.sandiego-romantics.com/hike-c...  Torrey Pines is a nice place to hike and enjoy Coastal Views.      It's just a short drive up to Mt. Soledad in La Jolla for a great view of the area.  Another panoramic view is Mt. Helix in La Mesa.    I'd also suggest a bay cruise of some kinds.  It's nice to see San Diego from the water.  Or take the ferry from downtown San Diego over to Coronado.  It's around $3 each way and it's a 15 minute ride.    One of my favorite parks in San Diego (and it's not crowded) is Presidio Park.  It's a gorgeous park and the perfect place for a picnic.  It's located just north of Old Town.    Have fun in San Diego!|`|bi6jW5VOaa	Try http://www.cheap-fun-family-travel.com for more ideas    1.

tSCWgV2taa	looking at pictures, looks like at least parts of it have sidewalks
g05wGcPhaa	It depends on what needs to be done. If you just need an oil change most local shops charge around $15-$20. If you need a full tune up like changing spark plugs and checking maintenance lights etc... then some may charge anywhere from $60-$100 depending on what services they offer.    If you need accurate answers then just visit one of the local body shops. The Chrysler dealer might charge you an arm and a leg so avoid them at all cost unless you prefer them over the local body shops.|`|60b2a2e456bb4fd7ccdb247a79ff9c92aa	no less than 350 bucks only an oil change is 90.     good area and good shop .(insuranced and licensed shop)    jiffy lube oil change is 29.
