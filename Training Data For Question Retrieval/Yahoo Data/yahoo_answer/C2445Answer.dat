Look for Ballet music like Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, Romeo & Juliet, etc. One of my favorite songs is one I found on an Anaheim ballet cd. It's called "Shades" and I think it by someone called Evan Rosenberg. I could be confused on the artist, but search for Shades and you should find it. Oh! The "Carnival of the Animals" has some great songs! Especially "Aquarium!" Look for some of those.|`|tOeq2Q2jaa	i think that you should do anything classical like bach or beathoven. that is what i listen to and if you can not find anything look up ballet music on i tunes and you will find somthin.<br>  From sarah|`|8dlxCanCaa	Sleeping beauty has some great songs. Don Quijote has beautiful spanish influenced classical music but one of my personal favorites would have to be the Swan Lake soundtrack. Our teacher sometime lets us pick out some more modernish songs so a good song is Beethoven by the trans siberian orchestra. It is an instrumental but it has more of a rocked out version of beethoven. Good luck!!

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	It was a secret accord that guaranteed Nazi Germany if they invaded Poland the Soviets would not intervene.  Additionally, it guaranteed the Soviets a free hand in the Baltic States, Finland, and East Poland.  The dividing line between Soviet and German forces would be the Bug River.  The Soviets also saw the chance to take Bessarabia from Romania; it wasn't part of the deal but Stalin felt, rightly that Germany would take no action.<br>  Additionally, it guaranteed grain and other raw material shipments to Germany at an extremely favorable rate of exchange.  (This was a primary reason that Britain's initial blockade strategy, which worked in WW1 would fail.)<br>  Strategically, it also secured the German rear while it dealt with France and Britain.  In short it precipitated the Second World War in Europe.<br>  Later, after Hitler invaded the USSR, he met with Finland's Field Marshal Mannerheim, and basically apologized for leaving Finland to fend for itself during the Winter War.<br>  The Soviets denied signing the Pact until the Glastnost Period of the late 1980's btw.|`|XCn2dK1laa	It's how they agreed to split up Poland between them after Hitler invaded it.

MHFuJGdGaa	Consider this:  If I were to be a surgeon, would you expect me to practice medicine straight out of high school?  No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines. Sense memory, Emotive memory, Place work, and moment-to-moment technique are all building blocks in a complex system developed by Stanislavsky modified by Strasberg, and near perfected by Meisner, which are MANDATORY to be a talented actor.  Marlon Brando did not wake up one day knowing how to act.   <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love." So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.|`|Mig6O93Naa	everyone gives you too much info  It is quite simple. to become an actress, you must act. Act in school, church and community plays to find out if you have any talent. In a few years if you are doing good roles well, then you can move on to professional lessons and continue acting in plays but add non union commercials and films. Build your resume with more classes,learn the business, get an agent and continue all of the above. That will take a few years to complete so it is time to get started.|`|pHoqVJC0aa	Well its a bit unexpected just to say you want to become an actress? Is it to do with seeing glamorous actress's on the TV? Or because you want the money? The best answer would be 'I simply love acting' and i hope that's the case :) OK first of all how old are you?If you are young then its the perfect time to get started, if you're 15/16 you can still start but if you want a career you'll have to get going quick. You have to think what aspect of acting am i interested in? TV, stage or film? Start getting plenty of experience such as join a drama class, find out about auditions in your local area, if you're really desperate then get an agent but i wouldn't recommend this until you're older. Acting is not as easy as go to a few auditions,land a big one then suddenly become famous i know you probs are thinking 'yes i know this' but read on. To be a successful actress you have to work your way to the top, in a recent interview Kate Winslet stated that before she landed Titanic and other small time rolls, she had been to 167 auditions, but she kept on at it and know look where she is, oscars and grammys left right and center! Anyway onto how. As i said before try to gain as much experience as possible, perhaps do your work experience at a theatre, where you'll learn a lot! I hope i've helped X|`|O05HQLohaa	Becoming an Actress<br>  Find every opportunity in your traveling distance that does Plays or Musicals.  Check the schools and community groups as well as professional. Contact them and ask to be notified of any auditions.  <br>  If you do not get a part, offer to help in any way (paint scenery, usher etc.) Just being around the production you will learn a lot.<br>  Study Dance, Music and Acting.  You must be able to do at least one great and the others well enough to let the others work around you.  Find classes or instructors that have produced talent.<br>  Work on your image.

I would use an 800/1600 speed film for capturing the action with freeze frame(1000th/500th) action and using a good 100 speed film for some good motion blur shots taken with slow shutter speeds(125th/60th).  And one of my favorites is mixing Freeze and blur by using Fill Flash at 60th of a second with 100 speed film, you get the motion blur with a frozen image at the same time.<br>  <br>  I am an art photographer not a Photojournalist so freezing the action is not my choice all the time!|`|7uCfW237aa	No slower than 125th, and when you are taking the shot follow the action with your camera. (like a panning shot).

Indeed several of his marriages were to this end and one of the reasons why Anne Boleyn was executed was because her "witchcraft" caused the birth of a girl (Elizabeth) rather than the boy Henry wanted. <br>  I can not see any reason except propaganda by her European opponents (chiefly Spain) and internal enemies (the Catholics which she allowed to be persecuted) to suggest anyone contemporary doubting her gender. <br>  In my opinion she was definatly female.|`|Cbom3Lweaa	She had to act like a male to prove that she could lead the country as people thought a female couldn't lead the country|`|wmBK9uASaa	Utter rubbish|`|9b81c31e1adf2522ad199b99176a9168aa	I agree complete rubbish. There are some who believe the  holocaust never happened and generally these people do not have the intelligence or work ethic to research proper history and so promote wild theses, for shock value. If Henry's second wife had given him surviving son he could have indulged his desires with mistressess instead of by making up spurious charges of witchcraft and incest in order to remove her. As anyone who has studied the Tudors will know Henry doted on Jane Seymour only because of the Son she gave him. He had had politically more advantageous wives and by all accounts loved Anne as he persued her for long enough. Also the birth of a royal child was not a private matter for family to enjoy there would have been witnesses to the birth and a court waiting to greet the new arrival. Also i'm sure her maids would have noticed that she was a man as too would of her many lovers and suitors- in fact Elizabeth went to great pains to overcome some image issues she had as a woman- why go to these lengths if she was in fact a man and could be the King people thought more fitting for a ruler.|`|HSIi8qOWaa	I think that it's a sexist response to a woman who managed to rule a country without a king by her side. It's a bunch of crap, you're right to think this is an illogical perspective.

If you like someone, be their friend.  I know it's kinda difficult.  I've been in the situation.  If he acts like an idiot around you, chances are, he likes you.  If he doesn't, you'll get the notice after some time.  What's the point of flirting with someone else if your goal is a whole nother person.  All you've done there is confuse the person you like, hurt the person you flirted with, and gotten yourself in another mess.  I'm not a pro or even an amature at this stuff, and I know how it will work out in the end.  Just be friends.  =)  Trust me, I HAVE been in the situation.  Don't forget to categorize your question correctly! =)|`|afe82282e2a783becaeed5349ad7c646aa	Flirt with some else in front of him, and see if he notices. Watch his reaction carefully, if he DOES then you know you have his attention and you just have to get brave and ask him out. If he doesn't however, then think about asking the boy out who you are flirting with to try and get his attention you might find that you have accidentally met someone great. <br>  (IMPORTANT: It needs to be at a time when his cheerleader friend is not around! Or she will draw his attention!)<br>  Goodluck and remember there are always other fish in the sea, and the kid with pimples braces and good grades will have a better job than the guy who plays football and drinks his weight in beer.

At least this way you will get to know if you really want to be with this person without looking foolish.
fWq4GcnSaa	I freaking hate cliffhanger endings, where the author just sticks a random sentence in to make people buy the next book. A few stick out in my mind: (spoilers ahead!)<br>  <br>  ~ "In the Belly of the Bloodhound" by L.A. Meyer.<br>  I love these books. But the last passage was:<br>  " I have not been able to take my eyes of Jaimy's as I float, as if in a dream, to the gangway. I put my foot on it, and then...<br>     And then two bayonets cross in front of my chest and I hear the Captain intone, "Miss Faber by order of his majesty, King George the third, you are under arrest on the charge of Piracy!"<br>  AND THAT WAS HOW IT ENDED. I was so mad.<br>  <br>  ~"The Circle of Blood" by Alane Ferguson (Forensic Mysteries)<br>  So the murder was solved, everyone was happy, until the book ended like THIS:<br>  "Her eyes flew to the window...Staring down, she saw the one face she never wanted to see again. In the drifting snow stood Kyle O'Neil."<br>  It sucked.<br>  <br>  ~"Scorpia" by Anthony Horowitz<br>  *main character suddenly gets shot*<br>  "Alex Rider smiled and closed his eyes."<br>  REALLY, ANTHONY HOROWITZ? REALLY?|`|8McA6xqPaa	The ending to 'Denial' by David Belbin<br>  <br>  The normal seeming YA story was about how a teenage girl dealt with rumors about her father (a teacher) and a pupil at her school. It wasn't written well throughout, but in the last few pages it started getting a lot worse, and from out of nowhere began mentioning how the main character had been abused as a child by her dad, the teacher, and a page later she happily pushes him down the stairs and kills him. It was really really odd. The 'epilogue' could have been written better by my kid sister. Truly, worst book I've ever read,|`|weMhsZUNaa	The end of Breaking Dawn. <br>  Meyer probably wanted it to be perfect, living happily ever after. But it was boring.

I was 22 and I was pregnant and the book was really confusing. There were so many story lines intertwined together at the beginning which I thought was okay but still confusing and then all the story was all completely unconnected and none of it made sense! By the end of the book I was really annoyed when it gave those cheesy 'and they all lived happily ever after' lines and the book wasn't finished. The author also said they weren't going to make a sequel and I got so annoyed I ripped the book up,threw it in the toilet and went into labour, but hey,life goes on...|`|ac2x3YbLaa	The Epilogue at the end of Deathly Hallows, book seven of the Harry Potter series.<br>  <br>  No mention of several people who survived and meant something in the series, people paired with people that they shouldn't have been with, Harry naming his child after a man who abused him for six years and another man who set him up to allow himself to be killed.<br>  <br>  The end of the series was disgusting.<br>  <br>  Raven|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Well,it depends.<br>  Are you trying to give something a bad ending or something?<br>  <br>  <br>  Well,the book Daughters of Eve by Lois Duncan is a reeeally good book,but the ending was horrible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well,one bad way to end it is leaving the person not knowing what is going to happen next..And no intention on making a sequal.<br>  And just be creative and dumb.|`|zqxP5exvaa	The Lady and the tiger<br>  <br>  IT DIDNT TELL U IF THE DUDE DIES!!!!!<br>  <br>  he had to choose a door....one was a tiger that would kill him and the other was a lady.....his true love pointed to a door and he wondered if she would lead him to his death for betraying her or give him the girl b/c she wants him to live. she pointed to a door and he walked to it opened it and............................THE END|`|ISnGWFDzaa	Belle Prater's Boy.

One ending I hated from a prominent novel was the ending of Stephen King's Salem's Lot. The one character I loved was basically left to wander the earth and didn't have a chance for redemption, the main characters ran away from their 'problems', and when they come back, their actions probably don't make a difference.<br>  <br>  [/rant]<br>  <br>  I also don't like any ending that is overly confusing and doesn't answer the big questions the plot was driven by.

So cheesy, so cliche, so STUPID. The books were bad enough, but when I read that last sentence, I wrote off their worth entirely. Sentimental dreck and pandering to the audience base.<br>  <br>  <br>  @Twilight fangirl with the badly capitalized name:<br>  <br>  First, it's I would HAVE chosen Jacob.

The whole point was that you had to think about what they would have chosen.<br>  <br>  Are people really THAT ignorant nowadays?|`|TU7vDI95aa	Spoiler Alert.<br>  <br>  I hated the ending to Breaking Dawn.  There was such a build-up of suspense and then a complete anticlimax.  The ending sucked!  I guess if you consider the entire book of Breaking Dawn to be the ending of Twilight series, then you could say that the entire plot of Breaking Dawn was the worst ending ever.  Girl gets married and pregnant at eighteen?  Girl decides that becoming a vampire is a good idea?  Vampire BITES A BABY OUT OF A UTERUS?

jlHz0Fg1aa	Melodies just don't magically appear... writing a good melody is the most open part of writing a song.<br>  I usually write a melody first, then the chord progression, then worry about things like arrangement and rhythm and harmony.<br>  Whenever I have trouble getting the melody, however, someone once told me that a good melody has to be based off a good chord progression. I don't neccesarily agree with this; but I think it helps to go in that direction when I'm stuck.

saYkDVGlaa	First, is there a reason you're looking for a film camera?  I started with an AE-1 almost 30 years ago and had to justify every shot I took against how much it would cost me to develop.  I took a photography course over 25 years ago and the one thing that stuck with me most was the comment the instructor made.  He said "to take good pictures you have to take a lot of them.  Either you will get better with practice, or even the worst photographer will get lucky once in a while."  Digital allows you to take a lot of pictures without additional cost.  You can take many shots of the same image using multiple settings to learn what they do.  Shooting film, this gets very expensive.  Additionally, the digital camera files include the exif data, all of the settings you used for that image.  Film cameras require you to write it down so that when you get around to developing the film, you know what you did to get it.  Unless you are taking a photography class with a dinosaur of a teacher that requires film. I would highly recommend a digital SLR such as a Canon Rebel or the Nikon D40.|`|razhTFIiaa	My first SLR was digital I got the Canon XT.  Now that I understand using the priority settings on it I am looking at getting a fully manual film camera to further my understanding of the way a camera works.<br>  <br>  I liked having a digital first because I didn't have to take a whole roll of film to see whether or not what I was doing was turning out correctly.  And I would not have understood the manual camera a friend lent me if it hadn't been for my knowledge of using the digital camera.<br>  <br>  I have no experience with the a-1 nor the ae-1<br>  <br>  But I hope this still helps you make a decision you will be happy with.

XCn2dK1laa	you mean like did medieval food evolve into modern food?<br>  or do you mean did medieval food influence modern food?<br>  I think it's both.Not only that,the fork was invented in medieval times in europe and it's still used today so why not?|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Wealthy medievals liked to make their food into art, like cutting it into shapes or coloring it.  They would have loved the appearance of hamburgers and pizza.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, medieval Europeans did not have access to foods from the New World like potatoes or tomatoes.  Foods that are common for us, like salt, cinnamon, and oranges, were expensive and hard to get for them.  So they wouldn't have had a glass of orange juice.  They also didn't have cane sugar or any modern food additives or preservatives.<br>  <br>  We still eat one medieval food, pretzels, in the same way that they ate it.  Pancakes and oatmeal would be recognizable to them.<br>  <br>  Medieval food had to have made an impact on modern food, because some of our cooking traditions trace back to classical Rome.  You could also say that the medieval drive for better-tasting food, better nutrition, more variety, and better food preservation led to modern foods.|`|CqzxTGpKaa	every generation of food made some sort of impact, it justs keep involving better and better

u0zEutf1aa	I have way too many scenes I love to choose just one. Perhaps the kiss at the end of The Phantom of the Opera? I do love how excited poor unhappy Erik was--it was the first time anyone had kissed him--and I love how he realized with the kiss that he couldn't keep her and he let her go.<br>  <br>  Maybe in Jane Eyre, when Jane tells Rochester she has to leave him? It shows Jane's strength, and it makes me cry. It's one of the only two scenes in books to ever make me cry. (The other is the end of A Tale of Two Cities. Which also qualifies, by the way.) I also love the scene the day after the proposal, with Mr. Rochester being all romantic and Jane teasing him. <br>  <br>  Or in Les Miserables, when M Myriel gives Valjean the candlesticks and buys his soul for God. It's simply beautiful. "Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul I am buying for you.

SYKGIiQkaa	Its sexist, obviously you haven't read many books if you believe it's 'the best book series ever'. Its not a saga, a saga is epic. Their is nothing epic about Twilight.<br>  <br>  "Plus, think about how insulting it all is to women in general. What is Meyer telling you, except that your life is incomplete without a man to swoop in and rescue you every time you trip over a crack in the sidewalk?

I like the series. It's a guilty pleasure, the little girl in me enjoys these books. HOWEVER it most certainly is NOT the best book series ever. There are literally thousands of books that are at least 50 billion times better. It's horribly written and the plot is quite shallow. They have become completely and utterly overrated.<br>  <br>  P.S. I think the hater comments bother you at least a little, if they didn't you wouldn't have said anything about it.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	When I read Twilight (about a year ago) I thought it was entertaining, no more, no less.  <br>  <br>  I now despise Twilight and all it's related books and merchandising, but I mostly cannot stand the faniacs who can speak of nothing else and who block/stalk/abuse anyone who doesn't worship the books.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	If you think it's the best book series ever, you haven't been exposed to very much literature, I'm sorry to say.<br>  <br>  It's very poorly written. A good editor would have cut it at least in half. Saying what a hunk of a man Edward is, page after page after page, is neither story development nor character development.<br>  <br>  The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth. Bella is what literary critics call a Mary Sue -- just an empty character that usually exists only for wish-fulfillment. Usually, authors use them as a way to inject themselves into a story. In this case, it's obvious what Meyer wanted to do -- create a character with as few details as possible, so that any reader could step into the role and identify with it. Do you read the series and say to yourself, "That's me"? That's because Bella is a Mary Sue.<br>  <br>  And Edward? Please. This is proof of a poorly written story -- stop and think for a moment why a 100-year-old vampire, who's been all around the world, would take even the slightest interest in a plain, clumsy 17-year-old girl. What, just because her blood smells good? I'm all for good fantasy fiction, but the premise at least has to make sense and be somewhat believable.<br>  <br>  See, you young ladies love this series because you can identify with Bella feeling awkward and not special, and you'd love for a "perfect" man like Edward to show you how much he loves you. The problem is what he displays isn't love. It's control and obsession. He's basically a stalker. I give most young readers a pass for confusing this with real love, because they probably haven't had a real relationship yet. But it most certainly is not love. In fact, it's quite unsettling for Meyer to say that's what this is.<br>  <br>  Plus, think about how insulting it all is to women in general. What is Meyer telling you, except that your life is incomplete without a man to swoop in and rescue you every time you trip over a crack in the sidewalk? I would be insulted if I were you -- Meyer basically says you can't be a whole, complete person without a man in your life to take care of you.<br>  <br>  The obsession with this series is really quite frightening. I understand why it's happening -- Meyer is tapping into adolescent insecurities and fantasies -- but that doesn't make it a good book series. Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  And yes, I've read the books.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Why would you ask what people think of Twilight if you're just going to freak out and cry "HATERS" to anyone who finds the series less than exemplary? Why bother asking for an opinion if you don't want to hear any that differ from your own?<br>  <br>  I find the Twilight series to be poorly written, from it's plot to the rampant thesaurus abuse that is evident on every single page of the four-book series. The characters are whiny and annoying overall. The relationships within the story are all more or less abusive or obsessive in some way, and offer a very poor example of what a good relationship should be to the books' young demographic.<br>  <br>  Why did I read the series then, you ask? Well, to be perfectly frank my younger sister owns the series, so I didn't have to spend a dime on the books themselves. They were an extremely easy read, and I wanted to see what the hype was about. It was mildly entertaining, but the degree in which the author and her characters have been idolized for such fluff offends me.|`|klPvo7iwaa	good plot, i like the story, just not the writing|`|VWRufnniaa	I loved it.<br>  <br>  It's a great book!

bojIKJMNaa	Both ballroom and Latin shoes (yes, they ARE different) have sueded soles, so the shoe slides easily on the ground but doesn't slip around like patent leather or something would. <br>  <br>  Ballroom shoes are closed-toed. Latin shoes are open-toed. Also, in Latin shoes your big toe is technically supposed to touch the floor instead of the shoe (like what would happen if your toes were too long for your shoes or if your shoes were too small)...it gives you more control over the way your foot is moving, I guess. <br>  <br>  But the way that dance shoes are "special" is mainly the suede soles, and the fact that the shoes are REALLY flexible.|`|Xqno8BTKaa	Latin dancing shoes (the strappy kind) usually only have a half shank, so they're very flexible, to give you an idea I can bend mine in half. Also, they have a suede sole to allow you to slide across the floor. They're also balanced differently to regular heels to push your weight onto your toes, which is where it should be if you're dancing latin anyway.|`|xQwU590Laa	Dancing shoes are very flexible, so you can point your toes easily without resistance from the shoes.

HFRCXpTpaa	By 'warped' do you mean stripped out?  ie: the hole is too big for the screw?<br>  <br>  If it is a solid body (electric) you could try two things.  I have done both and both were successful.  <br>  <br>  Fix 1:<br>  I had a bass guitar that i wanted to put strap locks on, replacing the stock strap buttons that came with it.  The hole left by the stock screws were too big for the new strap-lock screws so I filled the hole with two-part epoxy putty and then screwed the new strap lock into the putty.  Let it cure and its held solid for over 10 years now.<br>  <br>  Fix 2:<br>  I fixed a friends guitar at a show by coating a wooden matchstick with wood-glue and snapping off the wood stick where it exited the hole.  we then screwed the strap button back in and it held tight.  (this is an old carpentry trick, basically your just adding more material to fill the void.)
1UOnrM1Maa	The first 26 seconds was a bit too repetitive. I understand that this is the idea of music, but it may help to add a little more with each line? <br>  <br>  I really enjoyed the song, honestly. Makes me want to take up the piano again. I don't think there's much you should change, but keep in mind that you won't be able to include all of the effects that you did while playing in a school talent show, unless you're in a group. <br>  <br>  No clue what genre it'd be considered. Sounds like the background music during fight scenes on Kingdom Hearts, nerdy as that sounds.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you what to title it. But I don't think Destroyer is right. It was like..the best song I've heard on the piano in a while, without vocal accompaniment. It has an eerie tone, but at the same time it's kind of fun.<br>  <br>  I know you didn't ask for a rating, but I give it a 9/10. Excellent work!

ceBTTCPwaa	I love Mary Higgins Clark books. I have read every single one. With that said, I can't say this is her best, or even in her top 15. But I did read it all the way through, and it was entertaining, though somewhat unbelievable. <br>  <br>  Positive points: admirable protagonist, beautiful and smart (typical, of course!) Many characters to draw suspects from, several twists and turns that keep you reading. Also, family-friendly writing; you can always lend MHC books to your teenager and your grandma without worrying about the content. <br>  <br>  Not so great points: The "coincidences" that were pretty hard to believe. Also, the circumstances that the storyline takes place within are also questionable. You may question the main character's judgment at times and wonder what she was/is thinking. As long as you don't think about it too hard, you'll be able to look past these things. <br>  <br>  Bottom line- if you like a quick mystery/thriller and aren't bothered by glitches in the storytelling or circumstances, then you'll enjoy this book.

y8bFwXZEaa	To believe in an unchangeable ending is to believe free will has no purpose--or that it doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  To believe that you must believe you are a puppet.<br>  <br>  Why remain alive if you're a puppet to cosmic forces? To dance the dance? Ok, that might be a reason if your dance is a good one; but believing in an unchangeable fate also means everything you ever learned about character and integrity mean nothing because your fate is already set; Jefferson's gift of "the Blessings of Liberty to Ourselves and our Posterity" means nothing because there is no liberty; and the sovereignty of being human means nothing because your individuality isn't sovereign if fate is unchangeable--it belongs to the fates.<br>  <br>  Name the metaphysics, the epistemology, the ethics, and the aesthetics by which the fates operate.

Yet, I do not think this implies, some hidden superpower, no spiritual entity who manipulates us without our knowing what is going on.  FATE has come to be used out of context of the meaning I am applying it to.  The word FATE has come to be used in place of terms like "Ultimate Destiny," implying that outcomes are pre-ordained, inevitable and out of our control.<br>  <br>  I counter this argument by saying that NOTHING in life is written in stone, nothing is pre-ordained, nothing is inevitable.  FATE is the result of the logical outcomes of our decisions, made moment by moment.<br>  <br>  God does not whimsically sit hidden in the clouds, manipulating mankind with puppet strings nor does God enjoy being fickle and unpredictable by interfering with outcomes.  Mankind is not like flies for a capricious god who enjoys pulling the wings off  just to see a squirming struggle, drama in life and suffering.  FATE is not a punishment leveled on stupid fools or a reward for smart ones. FATE is clearly predictable if we look clearly at our choices and take full responsibility and own each and every one of them.  FATE is about teaching each of us how close or how far away we are from accepting responsibility for our decisions and the results.  The more we accept responsibility, the less we believe in FATE and the less responsible we are the more we believe in FATE as being capricious, unpredictable, inevitable and unavoidable.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Fate is a term used by people too lazy to do anything that may improve their lot in life.

uth8Ztbdaa	From Barnes and Noble:<br>  <br>  Vanity Fair is a story of two heroines---one humble, the other a scheming social climber---who meet in boarding school and embark on markedly different lives. Amid the swirl of London's posh ballrooms and affairs of love and war, their fortunes rise and fall. Through it all, Thackeray lampoons the shallow values of his society, reserving the most pointed barbs for the upper crust. What results is a prescient look at the dogged pursuit of wealth and status---and the need for humility. <br>  <br>  Vanity Fair, Thackeray's resplendent social satire exposing the greed and corruption raging in England during the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, brought him immediate acclaim when it appeared in Punch beginning in 1847. "The more I read Thackeray's works," wrote Charlotte Bronte, "the more certain I am that he stands alone—alone in his sagacity, alone in his truth, alone in his feeling (his feeling, though he makes no noise about it, is about the most genuine that ever lived on a printed page), alone in his power, alone in his simplicity, alone in his self-control. Thackeray is a Titan. . . . I regard him as the first of modern masters."<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Vanity-Fair/William-Makepeace-Thackeray/e/9780553214628/?itm=2" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Vanity-...</a>

eg71zQ5Raa	Very basically, like your eye except that the image is recorded onto either a light sensitive film or a light sensitive chip which "records" the image.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	A shutter controls the amount of light passing through a lens which focusses an image onto a sensitized surface (chemicals or more commonly digital sensors) within a light-proof case. The shutter speed is regulated in fractions of a second and can be varied to suit different light conditions. It can also be co-ordinated with a flash gun to provide the necessary light.|`|YktN7dEyaa	Photography is undoubtedly one of the most important inven-tions in history -- it has truly transformed how people conceive of the world. Now we can "see" all sorts of things that are actually many miles -- and years -- away from us. Photography lets us capture moments in time and preserve them for years to come.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The basic technology that makes all of this possible is fairly simple. A still film camera is made of three basic elements: an optical element (the lens), a chemical element (the film) and a mechanical element (the camera body itself). As we'll see, the only trick to photography is calibrating and combining these elements in such a way that they record a crisp, recognizable image.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many different ways of bringing everything together. In this article, we'll look at a manual single-lens-reflex (SLR) camera. This is a camera where the photographer sees exactly the same image that is exposed to the film and can adjust everything by turning dials and clicking buttons. Since it doesn't need any electricity to take a picture, a manual SLR camera provides an excellent illustration of the fundamental processes of photography.<br>  <br>  More on Cameras<br>  <br>  Camera Quiz<br>  <br>  Autofocus Camera<br>  <br>  Digital Camera<br>   <br>  <br>  The optical component of the camera is the lens. At its simplest, a lens is just a curved piece of glass or plastic. Its job is to take the beams of light bouncing off of an object and redirect them so they come together to form a real image -- an image that looks just like the scene in front of the lens. <br>  <br>  But how can a piece of glass do this? The process is actually very simple. As light travels from one medium to another, it changes speed. Light travels more quickly through air than it does through glass, so a lens slows it down. <br>  <br>  When light waves enter a piece of glass at an angle, one part of the wave will reach the glass before another and so will start slowing down first. This is something like pushing a shopping cart from pavement to grass, at an angle. The right wheel hits the grass first and so slows down while the left wheel is still on the pavement. Because the left wheel is briefly moving more quickly than the right wheel, the shopping cart turns to the right as it moves onto the grass. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  The effect on light is the same -- as it enters the glass at an angle, it bends in one direction. It bends again when it exits the glass because parts of the light wave enter the air and speed up before other parts of the wave. In a standard converging, or convex lens, one or both sides of the glass curves out. This means rays of light passing through will bend toward the center of the lens on entry. In a double convex lens, such as a magnifying glass, the light will bend when it exits as well as when it enters. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  This effectively reverses the path of light from an object. A light source -- say a candle -- emits light in all directions. The rays of light all start at the same point -- the candle's flame -- and then are constantly diverging. A converging lens takes those rays and redirects them so they are all converging back to one point. At the point where the rays converge, you get a real image of the candle. In the next couple of sections, we'll look at some of the variables that determine how this real image is formed.-
RXtUaI5baa	Good imitation of his style.  It would be better, as another answer suggested, if you used the pigments more boldly to give some emphasis.  <br>  <br>  It is ok if want to play around with emulating another artists style, but if you truly want to be able to call your work original, it must depart from Pardee's more than you have here.  Pardee has created his own concept, much like the "ugly dolls," or the work of the Jacobs brothers "Life is Good" line.  They are catchy and cute, but copying them is not creating something original.<br>  <br>  Keep working at it, and try adding your own new ideas to your work.  Like you said, you can be inspired by another artist, but that usually means you incorporate ideas, study methods, or use his art as a jumping off point . . . . NOT copying his concept and style.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  It is fun.|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	I like your idea and where you're going with this, but I've also got 2 suggestions.<br>  1) bolder colors.  You probably don't want your work to look just like Alex Pardee's, but even in the paintings wiht little color, the colors were hard and barely translucent.<br>  2) no words. I'm no art major, but I've definitely learned that a HUGE part of art is interpretation.  When you add words to a piece, it's like you're taking away some potential communication between your work and the audience.  It's like art is an entire experience and and if you add words to describe what the the creature is thinking or to make it comical, you're not giving the audience the opportunity to interact with it.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful.|`|1iXvphNYaa	I think they're all quite frankly startling but I definitely dig the creativity there. So all I can say is its beautiful.|`|cwsaoLJhaa	the alex pardee photo didn't show up on my computer :( but i have to say..i love your painting! it's so so cute! i'd pay for it!|`|sX3xxLAIaa	its really  good! did you make it? if so how long did it take to make-i like popsicles to!!!|`|E4qNeHnvaa	It is a fun picture.<br>  <br>  I think Pardee is able to concentrate the color, both in intensity and in location.  If you were able to identify where you want the focal point to be and use the most color there, it might add a bit more drama to the picture.  Also embrace the lines and the black to add more contrast. This critique is in trying to emulate Pardee's aesthetic. <br>  <br>  What you currently have is rather whimsical.

"Inscribed" is a short note addressed to a particular person:  "To John, who was a great friend during the writing of the book.  /Signed/ Will Shakespeare.".  Inscribed is usually considered more valuable, since it's a more personal connection to the author.  If the person the book is inscribed to is famous, or the inscription reveals details of the author's life or the process of writing the book, the inscription could be even more valuable.<br>  <br>  Of course, if the author is completely obscure and nobody much wants the book anyway (like, it was vanity press) then neither a signature or inscription will help much.|`|yig566gEaa	It is always better to get a book actually signed by the author and not just pre-put on the book my a press or machine and mass-produced|`|ac2x3YbLaa	TRANSITIVE VERB:<br>  in·scribed , in·scrib·ing , in·scribes<br>  <br>     1.<br>           1.

AA10515207	As an older adult who reads voraciously I'd be interested in seeing how you would pull it off. I like the idea that you would leave the details to the reader's imagination. Books that were written on bisexual love when I was younger were either "dirty" in their depiction of that kind of love or hit you over the head w/ details. My only suggestion is have the bisexual girl be the "Snow White" character. It would provide the twist that would keep the reader going. You could have more "fun" writing about the bad @s-s girl, but then I think you could get bogged down in stereotypes. Just a few thoughts from an avid reader & a fellow writer. Whatever you decide, good luck.<br>  <br>  [edit] Snow White as in the good girl--the wholesome type in contrast to the other character. I think you could do a lot w/ the 2 different personalities. Even tho they're different, they're drawn to each other & find things in the other that people around them miss. One is the antithesis of the other.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	I wouldn't be "weirded" out.

(Hopefully that was just a typo, but I figured I'd point it out just in case.)<br>  <br>   And I wouldn't care one way or the other, but it seems a little stereotypical to have the "bad" girl be the one with bi/homosexual feelings.|`|zMlh0EuVaa	It seems like a really good book cant wait to read it

AA12185092	I don't think there was any one year when color film became the norm. The first readily available color film was Kodachrome (1935). Color print film came in 1942. The early color print films were slow, not very saturated, and the prints faded in after a few years. They probably persuaded a good number of amateurs to stick with black&white. Kodak's monopoly on processing was broken in 1955, which probably helped boost usage. Instamatic cartridge film came out in 1963, bringing photography more into the mass market.<br>  <br>  I would say color photography began to catch on in the 50s and was probably the majority of the market by the early to mid 60s.

EZHZW7QFaa	It's ok hunny this WILL pass. I can honestly say that i have felt this way before and it was on and off and sometimes it would last for a while. I understand what it feels like to be terribly unhappy. You can't rely on anyone to make you happy you have to find it yourself. And trust me you will. I didn't think i could but i did. Take up a hobby, start writing, exercize..there's alot of things that can help you! Things will look up! And of course sometimes people feel like life has no point! You WILL find your own happiness! My best friend lost her mother to cancer, failed out of college, and then was in a car accident and needed physical therapy for 2 years before she felt herself again and when she did she started exercizing, she took yoga, she bought a dog to love, got into bellydance and became a teacher and then she met a GREAT guy...she found her own happiness and you definately will too. And i am not bypassing your feelings in any way b/c your feelings are really important i just want to make you see how other people have struggled and maybe that will simply inspire you...Good luck keep your head up everything will be ok!! <3|`|4Ka4Mqo5aa	Life and suffering....it can either grind you down or polish you up.

After trudging through it all; the arguments over curfew, what i could and couldn't do, who my friends were( real friends ), and most of all the conflict of "who am I"; I realized God was the only one who could help me.<br>  <br>  So I got to know Him by learning what and who he is.  Every thing He is, was, and will be and everything He has done and will do is very well documented in the Bible. <br>  <br>  Skip the Old Testament for now and begin with Matthew. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of places online to read it and you can even google stuff like:  bible feeling lost,   bible wanting love,   bible angry<br>  <br>  Love God first and He will teach you to love yourself so you can love others as yourself.   This is of the utmost importance.  Love in any other way is blind.|`|AA11480266	You sound young, so maybe when (If) you go off to school you can get away from your parents and meet new friends.

If you don't go to collage maybe one of your friends and you could get a place together? Once again freedom.  But a lot of people have these thoughts your not the only one. If it gets worse see a doctor, there's help. Good Luck my friend, and I'll be your friend no mater what you deside.|`|IUOxJASHaa	Put things into perspective. I think that's the most important thing. Think from your parent's view. Think about the starving children in Africa and poverty in India. Don't you think you are luckier than them? You have internet access and I presume a computer in your room! =)<br>  <br>  Think about your parents. They gave birth to you, they brought you up. They only want the best for you. From the sound of it, it doesn't seem like they hit you or anything violent like that. <br>  <br>  If your friends have forgotten you, then they are not really your friend. True friends are always there. I just moved to a new school and some of my old friends don't call me or ask me out at all. But there is one person who I have kept in touch and I know that she is a genuine friend. We trust each other and support each other during hard times.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is love yourself. Then other people will love you. But family, they love you unconditionally, no matter what. I think your parents do, it's not like they starve you or abuse you. =]<br>  <br>  <br>  My grandpa died last year and then my dog died in summer, I was devastated and these two events really made me close up. They were dear to me, really. However, I was able to pull through the hard times because I put things into perspective. People die, it's normal. You need to die in order to live. I hope you understand what I mean by that.<br>  <br>  There is a point in life as long as you believe and make the most of it. You only get to live once, so why live in sorrow? <br>  <br>  I really hope you don't do anything silly. Just remember the good things about yourself and the things you will miss if you 'vanished', maybe ice cream or chocolate. I know I will miss them! <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and best wishes|`|JDBeFikOaa	I am sorry to hear that and you had to go through a lot. Other people will think about you,???.. definitely yes. A very few will think good of others and rest will blabber a few words abt you and forget it. <br>  No body has enough time to think about you and your feelings. <br>  Your true friend is yourself and you both has to walk over every situation. <br>  Imagine the current situation a few years later and you will laugh "O my goodness, I felt that way then...., I must be crazy to cry that much.."   There are downfallls for every body and it is life and no human being in this world can escape from the fact of life whether it be a king or popper... <br>  I know giving advices is easy....  after all its you who has to walk...<br>  First thing.... Get up in the morning, look at yourself in the mirror and smile.  Fresh up and make simple breakfast for your parents and sit together with your family and say that you had a tough time recently and you are sorry for arguing. Parents are closest friends... they will forgive every mistake and love you unconditionally....  Go to school/work and just say "Hi" to your friends, Don't expect any reply...If they reply, well and good. If not say hi again the following day. Your true friends will definitely talk to you back, if not first day the next day.  <br>  Remember smile and try to live the present moment.  Whatever bad happened you cannot change it and what will happen in future, You dont know..... Try to spend a little family time together and help your parents with the family chores... and try to involve yourself in some work and hey " forgive the immature fellow ".  Its hard to gather the energy, but dont lie in the bed. Play, watch movie, read... ride a bike..Just dont curl up in the bed, it will depress you more. Sleep only at night... and Very important thing.. eat good healthy diet. [The reason is good food maintains a healthy balance of hormones and chemicals in body which effect our moods]<br>   If possible try to help some one (Not beyond your capacity).

You really should look at your life an re evaluate. There are many people out there who are not as fortunate as you and who have problems that far exceed yours. I understand that feeling this way is horrible but you should also not be afraid to tell people how you feel. You always look out for number one first regardless of how conceded that sounds. Just try being more open and friendly the more you surround yourself with positive people the more positive you will become. If you do not think any of this is going to help then i suggest going to see a therapist and getting it straightened out.

V2v66A7Waa	These are great excersises of pointe. You would get strong ankles and a very good arch. I highly recommend using an elastaband or theraband, they are really great for what you need! <br>  *To get a theraband, you can order online here is the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.discountdance.com/frame_set.p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.discountdance.com/frame_set.p...</a><br>  If you get the Gaynor Mindon resistabands, they come with an instruction book with some great exercises for you!<br>  <br>  **Stand with your toes on the edge of a stair or something to get your feet off the ground like a small step stool if you don't have stairs. Now do releves up to a nice tall 3/4 point position, pushing your arch and heel up and over as much as you can. Then lower your feet down below the step as low as you can go. Do these nice and slow at first, a full 8 cts up and a full 8 cts down. Try starting with 10 at a time and work up to more. Then do the same exercise quickly, like 2 cts up and 2 cts down. Start with about 25 of these and then add on.<br>  <br>  **Sitting on the floor with you legs straight out or sitting in a chair hold up one leg at a time, use your big toe to "write" the alphabet, first in print then in cursive. Do this with both feet.<br>  <br>  **Sit in a chair and put marbles down on the floor. Place all the marbles to the left side of your foot. Moving your foot in a side to side motion, pick up one marble with your toes then drop it off after you've moved your foot to the other side. Continue doing this until you've moved all the marbles from the left side of your foot to the right side. Now move them all back. Do this with both feet.<br>  <br>  **Just pointing your feet as hard as you can and holding as long as you can is also a good exercise. Do this when you lay down to go to sleep, when you watch tv, when you are doing homework, anytime you can do it.<br>  <br>  **Do sautes in first and second positions and make your feet do more work than your legs. Try to jump with as little bend in the knees as possible so your feet have to push off the floor harder an push all the way through your point when you leave the floor.<br>  <br>  **Standing at a barre, behind a chair, or at the kitchen counter, place your feet in first then raise one foot to coupe, demi plie, lift your foot to 3/4 point, and then straighten your knee and hold the releve. Do about 10 of these on each foot to start, working up to more. Then do the same exercise in reverse, releve then demi plie, then lower to a flat foot. You can also just do releve and lower on each foot over and over until you feet and ankles are stronger. (this one is also great with your pointe shoes on, once you've started en pointe)|`|ciz0qYwnaa	Only if you are not doing this already > Practice every day for a minimum of 30 minutes! Do relevés in 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th (parallel) position and keep your balance without holding unto anything and keeping your arms in a nice port de bras; practice arabesques or attitudes in relevés, and basically start getting your toes ready for pointe! <br>  <br>  Pointe really hurts at first, because your toes and feet are still unaccustomed to the exercise; but as time flies by the pain will go away and getting on your pointes will be easier. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uZo5cLscaa	Stretching your foot with a  theraband helps your pointe/releves<br>  <br>  Practice sharp tondues, and high releves every day. Also, practice getting your body forward ALWAYS...the tendency with pointe is to lean back in the spine to compensate for not being up on pointe all the way, which is very dangerous for the back. <br>  <br>  Though nothing can prepare you for the pain, if you are ready for pointe it will be a lot easier (it is EXTREMELY dangerous to go on pointe if you are not ready). So be sure to practice every day in order to be ready|`|rxZqgDRIaa	i swear whatever you try nothing can prepare you for the pain! having said that the pain gets easier as time goes on... i'd say only time prepares your feet and ankles before putting the pointes on each time!
WmXicRJjaa	Frankenstein, I do believe<br>  Good question!|`|AA10648704	Frankenstein, of course.  Interestingly, it was written when she, Percy Byce Shelley (her lover), Lord Byron, and her sister were holed up in a hotel in Switzerland during a storm.  They decided to each tell a horror story, and decide whose was the best.  That night, Mary dreamed up the plot for Frankenstein.  Obviously, she won.  But when it was published, it was a time when no one would touch a novel written by a woman, so it was published as having been written by "a friend of Percy Byce Shelley."  She actually received little money for it or from Shelley's work (they later married), and she ended up writing short stories to support herself and their children after he died.|`|Lw5LaIriaa	Frankenstein (the Modern Prometheus)<br>  <br>  It's an amazing book!

It was wrinkled and torn at the edges and once I ironed it and put it back in the frame it looked great. I used a warm iron (not too hot) and ironed it on the back on an ironing board with a cloth cover. The iron has to be warm enough to iron out the wrinkles but not too hot because I thought it might burn the paper. Start out with it only a little warm and then increase it until the wrinkles smooth out.

ANzszvWRaa	Sadly the Great Plains no longer exist. They were, in the mid-19th century, over a million square miles of not much more than grasslands, but there is some dispute among historians as to exactly where the boundaries should be drawn.<br>  <br>  The area known as "The Prairies" is considered to be a separate region by some, while others include it with the plains. The difference is essentially about the types of grass which originally grew in those areas - scrub, buffalo grass (sweet grass) and sagebrush on the Plains, much taller mixed grasses on the Prairies.<br>  <br>  In general terms, the Plains area extended from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Missouri river in the east, and from Texas to the Canadian province of Alberta (around 2,000 miles from north to south).<br>  <br>  This takes in the modern states of Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Arkansas, North and South Dakota,  Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Wyoming and part of Colorado.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The Great Plains are the broad expanse of prairie and steppe which lie east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada.

The Mediterranean area is an enormous area bigger than all of Canada and the U.S. together.<br>  <br>  Many of the people who were the original settlers in Eastern Canada were French and Scottish 'voyageurs' and fur trappers; Portuguese, and Spanish fishermen who fished the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for cod; English, Scottish and Irish subsistence farmers who were refugees from religious persecution, changes to agricultural practices requiring less manpower and leading to forced eviction from smallholdings, and famine brought about by the potato blight<br>  in Ireland and Scotland.<br>  <br>  Later there were immigrations from Italy, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, China, Ukraine, Greece, Germany and Hungary.<br>  <br>  Within a few years it should be possible economically to trace your blood lines through D.N.A testing.

But this gets the body moving in the perfect way to allow people to get the hips moving to dance best. I dance everyday and go to proper classes once a week and i find this helps me in every way. <br>  Another way to become a better dancer is to go to ballet classes this is the basic of all dance and will allow you to move your body in almost in every way.

It's part of her cultural heritage.|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Shakira learned to bellydance. What that means is she mastered the use of her diaphragm and the muscles in her abdomen. I started belly dancing at the beginning of the summer and didn't realize how HARD it is to isolate certain parts of your body! This is what Shakira is doing when you watch her perform. Take belly dance classes! Your teacher will most likely be better than Shakira b/c Shakira incorporates too many latin moves into her dancing. My belly dance teacher said the last person i wanna look like is Shakira! (lol) - but just to let you know i used to watch shakira and say "whoa how does she do that? No way could i do it" - well its been about 9 months of me dancing and practicing and now i can watch her videos and do exactly what she's doing and layer my moves and all that...Take it up its a different, exotic, and sexy dance that people will be mesmerized by you!!
2t0YgKXXaa	I think it is the Islamic one. The Greeks discovered many things, but the Islamic Goldenage took that knowledge to another level. Also they came up with many things themselves. They had the largest empire in the world at that time, so they could bring in thinkers from many different places with talents, while the Greeks only published their own works, opposed by their governments even sometimes. <br>  They were responsible for bringing paper to the Western countries, in addition to making the scientific process. They also were first to see the harm of pollution. Even the Guinness book says that they were the first university to give degrees to students and had many inventions.<br>  Averroes was even allowed to criticize the religion and live, unlike poor Socrates!|`|mzsoiTrNaa	Did Islam have a Golden Age?<br>  <br>  I think that Ancient Greek ideas in philosophy, art, government etc are by far more important than anything Islam ever offered.<br>  Probem is none of those ideas are used properly today in US or on any other country (including my country Greece).<br>  <br>  @ Edith:<br>  :) I have concluded that distorting truth is a hobby for some people. Question is why are you doing that?<br>  Do you seriously believe that the "blood empire" of Islam (I guess you mean the Arabs) had a Golden Age?<br>  Can you mention any islamic philosopher?<br>  Or: tell us when did that Islamic Golden Age occur?<br>  Or: how did they become so primitive as they are today since they were so advanced as you describe?<br>  <br>  Truth is that Arabs became civilized when they took over Persia and when Greek scientists and philosophers found a refuge in their areas (especially Egypt) because the Byzantine Empire (or: Eastern Roman) simply didn't want the ancient Greek spirit to be around.

REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period!

Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money.

y8bFwXZEaa	Paying someone for kindness earned widens your limits.<br>  Paying someone altrusitically for unearned kindness will most definitely limit you. It limits your feeling of integrity and character, and makes you wonder why you feel as if those are being stolen from you.<br>  <br>  Paying for kindness earned grows your character and integrity and can never, ever hurt you.|`|X0ooc06vaa	Kindness never limits you, but if  the persons belief is bad then you shouldent reinforce it.|`|FoIxsunVaa	We hold our tongue all the time. When I answer a YA! question, I THINK about how to say it to be effective for the person I am trying to reach. I don't blather out what I really think completely unfiltered (although many folks would beg to differ with this opinion of myself.)<br>  <br>  Being a human means being careful. If we are lucky, careful becomes second nature and we don't "break" our on rules too often, as I did recently in here.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the question.|`|yOK32PM9aa	No, never limiting, but it must be applied appropriately.|`|qdlmy4l8aa	A belief can't necessarily be 'wrong' per se, but backing it without having it is lethal to the friendship and one's own sense of self. That's not kindness; that's lacking a backbone.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief (virtual and otherwise,) I'm NOT EVIL; I don't believe in free handouts to unworthy recipients, and HONESTY is KEY. When someone is asking for help the worst thing anyone could do is to sugar-coat the situation. This isn't cruelty, it's tough-love, and it's taken me a LIFETIME of trying to help people to figure them out first of all, and to figure out which methods work best for which people. I'm a good judge of character more often than not.  Kindness, if given duly and in the right AMOUNT (enough to warrant a smile, but not enough to feel immune to criticism,) is probably the healthiest exchange, to the benefit of the giver and the receiver, there is. <br>  <br>  So, no, I've never felt limited by kindness. Limited in terms of the RIGHT opportunities, yes, but not limited with regards to my capability.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Yes, it can and does impose limits on you. If you lend a friend 50 dollars, and then see a dress you want but can't have (when you want it) because you lent your friend the money you would've spent, then you've been limited from a physical or logical point of view. Pure fact, plain and simple. But then, there are some limits we gladly place on ourselves. Some limits because they exist, makes us better people. I don't condone physical violence other than what one must use to defend themselves. In my opinion, and my opinion on myself at the end of the day is the only one that matters, that makes me a better person for it. And by better I don't mean better than someone else, just a better me for me. If you pick a major when you go to school, you've limited the variety of courses you can take, at the same time though, by that limit existing you can graduate on time, save a ton of money, and get what you want in life. We all face trade offs with everything we do. We can't do and be everything at once. So have I ever been limited by my kindness? Sure, if we've done a kind (or cruel act for that matter) we've limited ourselves in someway, shape or form. Realization of this doesn't change this fact. So the real question (I think) is, are limits necessarily a bad thing? I don't believe so, at least I've never felt that the limits I placed on myself weren't good limits, or were limits I was angry about placing on myself. Because even if someone repaid my kindness with cruelty, I know at the end of the day I did the right thing with the information I had at the time, and there is nothing else I could ever want to do. I wish everyone was always as kind as they could possibly be. (And no, I don't think the kind thing to do is always the emotionally easy thing to do) If we all were, the world would be a much better place in my humble opinion.|`|PGPTbMJVaa	Kindness is so rare, and people so cynical, that no one really believes anyone has an ounce of true kindness these days.  "They take my kindness for weakness," I often hear.<br>  Kindness never limits; it is so easy to let someone else's perception and reaction rub off--then you     fall.  So what?  You fall and you hurt your pride, and then you get your *** back off the floor and move on.|`|kyjcFBOHaa	yes, kindness has been taken for weakness.<br>  p.s. snoopy!:)

AjqO1aJgaa	Why don't you join a critique group? www.critiquecircle.com is good.<br>  <br>  What are you afraid of? <br>  Having it stolen? Everyone there is far too busy writing their own stories to bother with pinching yours.<br>  Not being thought the next Shakespeare? That's easy - you won't be. Either accept that or accept that you'll never be able to let anyone else read what you write. It's that simple.<br>  Being told your first draft needs a lot of work and isn't finished as-is? Some people are horrified by this. Actually it doesn't sound as if you will be.<br>  <br>  I really recommend you join critiquecircle. You can hang out there, critique other people's work to build up points (which you cash in when you post your own chapters), and use the forums, before you decide whether you want to put your own story up for critique. You don't have to ever post your own story, it's still useful. I posted regularly there for months and I don't even write original fic (I write fanfic, which they don't take).<br>  <br>  Alternatively, write something else. Anything. Heck, even a fanfiction vignette. Something written just to share. Post it online and see what happens. Once you've got past that "OMG somebody else is going to read what I wrote, what are they going to say" initial panic the first time, it's not so bad again.|`|6qsocyK3aa	That sounds like a good idea.

I see your dilemma with the whole situation, if it were me I would share your novel first with someone you can trust, a close friend or relative who may be able to come up with some irresistable inspiration. Failing that I think the novel swap is a good idea, as long you have checked that the pro-gramme you are using is safe, i.e your hard work does not get stolen, (believe me there are some ignorant people in this world). Or if the pro-gramme is not to be trusted, and you are deadly serious about this, then arrange to meet someone like a publisher or local writer who can give you inspiration. It really depends on what your novel is about as to where to get the finishing inspiration. Hope this helps...|`|gZnKQI60aa	I myself am a writing working on my first draft of my first novel. An old high school teacher of mine has been subjected to reading the beginning of my novel. I trust him completely and at first I had a very difficult time showing it to anyone, even him. <br>  <br>  When it comes to writing I get nervous when people read what I have written. I have a hard time talking to people about my writing and I am very self-concious. I can relate to you.<br>  <br>  I think that the fact that you have not yet determined how things will end is not bad at all. Plenty of authors do not know how things will go until the have that final draft completed and in their hands. I have no idea how my book will end. I figure a lot out as I go and as silly as it sounds sometimes just writing and thinking like the characters makes things happen that I never would have been able to make myself think of. <br>  <br>  I think putting your first draft online on a forum could be a big mistake. There is always the chance that the person reading it is not trust worthy and is just looking to steal an idea. That isn't always the case but it's definitely what worries me!<br>  <br>  I think you just need to keep at writing. We all hit our mental road blocks every now and then. Maybe you should consider doing some more freestyle writing that does not relate to your novel. I myself got to role-player.net it's a great website full of literate writers who create plots and look for participants in story writing. It helps with writing because it gives you a chance to put together new ideas and practice the craft in a less serious setting. You also get instantaneous feedback from your fellow players.<br>  <br>  I find that one of the best ways to get inspiration for my novel is to not focus on it too intensely. When I am writing other things I usually end up getting excited to go back to my "real work" on my novel. When I do that I always find that I have plenty of new ideas.<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel free to contact me. :)<br>  <br>  ctorrissi@gmail.com

lPxVt2XYaa	They were emancipated as a direct result of the Crimean War.  The Russians were humiliated in the war, as the British and French were able to get their troops to the Crimea and to re-supply them quicker than the Russians were - and the Crimea was Russian territory.  Alexander realised that the reason Russia lost the war was because it did not have an industrial base, it had very few railway lines and their peasant army was poorly trained, equip ed and motivated.<br>  In order to modernise the economy Alexander decided to emancipate the Serfs, but it was not a straight-forward freeing.  The serfs had to buy their freedom, the redemption payments were spread out over 50years, and many did could not afford it.  It was also resisted by the landlords in the productive areas, as they wanted to retain their (free) workforce.  It was these areas that Alexander wanted emancipation to work - as he wanted to free up labour to work in the new mines, factories and mills that he was planning.<br>  The long-term result was that it disaffected much of the aristocracy, but amongst the peasants, it helped to further alienate them, because the emancipation did not free everyone.  <br>  See:<br>  Russia People & Empire 1552 - 1917 - Geoffrey Hoskings
lPxVt2XYaa	Alexander reformed many things about Russia.<br>  Socially, he freed the serfs.  But they had to buy their freedom and many could not afford the 50 year repayments.  The land was not given to them, it was given to the village council  - the Mir.  The Mir then divided up the land according to who had the greatest need - so a family with a lot of children would get more land than a family with one child.  If, however, someones children died, their land was re-allocated to others.  All land was re-approtioned on a regular (I think 5 year( basis), so there was no incentive to improve the land.<br>  Economically he drew up plans for a massive investment in railways - (put in place under Alexander III).  The emancipation, he hoped would lead to greater agricultural output, in order to finance the railways, and the beginnings of Russia's industrialisation.<br>  Politically he instituted new provincial councils - zemstvos, and town councils, he also reformed the army & navy, along the British model.  He hoped that his reforms would quell the growing Narodnik movement (radical peasant who wanted a constitutional monarchy, or a republic) and, in the cities, the growing popularity of Marxism.

More than ever people wanted to do the right thing, to express their sense of value in the world.  We were a nation intent on not being terrorized, on showing you and yours--immediate family, spouses, sons and daughters, our truth, our esteem of happiness.  We voted with our wallets.  We saw through to allay fears and affirm trust by succumbing to the demands--the requests of comfort and succor--and purchased extravagently, rationalizing it in the meantime,<br>  as evidence of OUR value and esteem.  <br>  Is that a legitimate way of life?  Yes, it was legitimized by the fact that everyone was doing it.<br>  You can call it greed; that is legitimate.  But where in the big picture were your priorities?

y8bFwXZEaa	Like all ancient fables, this one is supposed to make us happy with what we have, instead of searching for more.<br>  <br>  Pandora's Box is full of evil. But it is the same exact morality story as the Apple in the Garden of Eden; the idea that Narcissus was hooked on his own looks instead of hooked on the virtue of character and integrity as he really was; and the old Chinese hex, "May your life be filled with excitement." You see, in ancient China, it was expected that you ought not want "excitement" because that meant you were exercising your ego.<br>  <br>  Opening Pandora's Box is a morality play on how one should forget one's ego and leave well enough alone, because you might "open a can of worms," which is another form of Pandora's Box.<br>  <br>  "There are two versions of the legend of Pandora's Box. One version tells us that box contained all kinds of misery. When Pandora opened the box a plague dispersed and doomed humanity to suffer ruin, insanity, and despair. She hastily closed the box to stop the plague but, pathetically, only Hope remained inside. In the other version the box held all of humanity's glories. When she opened the box progress, knowledge, and exaltation vanished into oblivion, forever lost to humanity.<br>  <br>  Today, in the here and now, both versions of the legend of Pandora's Box are tragically true."<br>  <a href="http://rebirthofreason.com/Articles/Newberry/Pandoras_Box_Part_I.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://rebirthofreason.com/Articles/Newb...</a>|`|AA11111233	Pandora was the first mortal woman.  One day, she was given a small box as a gift from the Greek Gods, but was told never to open it.  Over time, she began to get curious as to what was in the box until her curiousity eventually got the better of her, and she opened the box against the advice she was given.  She was horrified when all the evils of the world - war, sorrow, suffering, lawlessness - emerged from the box.

ZmdIlkpQaa	The quote from Franklin, in particular is almost certainly a fraud.  Franklin wrote numerous times about his sense of tolerance, including Jews and Muslims.  Moreover, my old friend Cecil Adams (of Straight Dope fame) notes that reputable historians are universal in repudiating this tale (which surfaced in the 1930's, by the way).  <br>  <br>  Here's some more info on the hoax from the Anti-Defimationj League.  I note that The Franklin Institute neither lists the Pinckney diary, nor have they ever claimed such a diary exists.  <br>  <br>  This article, which thoroughly documents the history of the transparent fraud known as the Franklin "Prophecy", appeared almost forty-five years ago in the April-May 1954 issue of Facts, a publication of the Anti-Defamation League. At the time, the authors wrote "This 20-year-old anti-Semitic hoax is circulating again." Today, more than sixty-five years after it was manufactured, the "Prophecy" it is still circulating, a staple of anti-Semitic propaganda. It can be found on a number of web sites maintained by haters and hate-groups. The article is, therefore, still timely and instructive<br>  <br>  Another anti-Semitic hoax on history, of a piece with that incredible forgery, The Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion, but not as widely distributed nor as successful in creating the pogrom atmospheres that were the achievements of the Protocols, is a speech attributed to Benjamin Franklin during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The anti-Semitic movement, which founded the hoax, calls it the Franklin Prophecy — ascribing to Franklin a dire warning that unless Jews were expelled from the new nation by Constitutional decree they would ultimately immigrate in great numbers to the detriment of the Christian population.<br>  <br>  Of course, no such speech was ever made. But the hoaxers sought to impart an aura of historical credibility to the fake by claiming that the speech is quoted in a "private diary" of Charles Pinckney, Revolutionary leader who was delegate from South Carolina to the Constitutional Convention. They also maintain that the diary is now in the possession of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, a bald lie which Henry Butler Allen, director of the Institute, has often refuted. Allen says that "historians and librarians have not been able to find [the diary] or any record of it having existed."|`|6RHBxCiKaa	I'm pretty sure those are made up.  I've never heard of any of the founding fathers being anti-semit, and I don't think that Franklin and Jefferson are the type of people who say those things.  I've heard of them being Free Masons (from the history channel, not national treasure) but never anti-semit. Also, you gotta look at the website your on before believing what is 'quoted' there.

YTasscmKaa	It sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders. You've taken some concrete action to change the things in your life that you don't like. That alone is a rare quality. Most people just complain and never change. What can you do? Well, you can give the changes you've already made time to take effect. You can also meditate on your feelings and see if you can puzzle out what you're missing. It could be a creative outlet, perhaps you need to find a way to express yourself through painting or writing? Last, but not least, remember its not natural for a human being to be happy all the time no matter how good their situation.|`|4AavBJy8aa	life is really **** , but it really has some nice moments and the nice moments are worth hangin on for :) if you really feel truly depressed it may be that you have clinical depression and should seek medical advice. i wish you the best of luck  in sorting this out.<br>  =) may u be happy|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...im confident, and responsible for all my choices and actions in my life...<br>  ...enjoying a content, happy and fulfilling life one day at a time...|`|CVp45z0kaa	There are many things that people live and die for, all you have to do is contemplate on what those things are and choose.  We're all here to do what we're all here to do, along with the many things God Most High has blessed you with, you've also been blessed with spiritual gifts.  I believe we are given these gifts to use them to better our lives and the world around us.  Even something as simple as writing a beautiful song from the heart is a contribution to all of humanity.  There are many things wrong with ourselves and our world so we are never without a mission to better ourselves and our world.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, direction and wisdom from God Most High should be sought through prayer and meditation.|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	This is not about a job, the time of year or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  It is about the way you have been taught to see the world.<br>  <br>  lucky for us we can change the way we see it.<br>  <br>  Love and blessings Don

We try things, sometimes they work, sometimes not.  Sometimes we get what we want, only to find out it wasn't what we thought it would be.  Sometimes we go three steps forward and two back just to make an inch of progress.  Sometimes we have it all, only to lose it in a brief moment.<br>  <br>  Hope comes from living the principles that we know are true to ourselves, regardless of the outcome.  When you do that, you feel the reward of being true to yourself, and that lets you face the next day with esteem and confidence, and that brings hope.   <br>  <br>  Right now you need to learn as you go, but with a sincere attitude, you will find your way.  Remember, in the Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch told Dorothy at the end that she had what she needed all along, but she couldn't hear the advice, so she had to go on the journey to Oz and discover that truth for herself.<br>  <br>  You only have today, so just live for today and you will see that the pages turn all by themselves for you, and when one door closes, another opens.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Don't think too much in the future enjoy this day as your last day.  You have to analyze what's really make you happy.  If you want to be a comedian and you put all your effort there is always a way as long as you keep positive.  You don't have to have a face as you mentioned, see Carol Burnett, she is not pretty but is the talent what's count.  If you want to become a Plastic Surgeon is ok also.  Just be possitive, when we get negative we close all the channel and feel lost.  On the other hand, if you are possive all the chanell are open and many ideas come to you.  Instead of worrying about 20 years from now, pray for guidance that God has a plan for you and nobody can destroy.  Enjoy today and think that in 20 years you will be where you suppose to be.  I hope the best for you and God guide and bless you.|`|l0FPw0LVaa	you create it|`|CVp45z0kaa	Hope is just a distraction, faith in yourself and that everything will be alright no matter what happens is more like it.  Many people sit around hoping and wishing but action is the only thing that will get you where you want to go.  Hope is also an illusion, as is the future.  The here and now is what you must focus on, you must make the actions that will secure your future.  The only thing you should distract yourself with is knowledge, wisdom, practice, research and resourcefulness.  Start doing anything you can now that will put you in the right direction, like auditioning, doing shows, researching schools etc.  Put yourself in the position where you have OPTIONS rather than hope.  Once you know you have done all that you can do to make your dreams reality, you'll have something great to hope for.  Best wishes and blessings from Most High.|`|t27SvIPbaa	If you lived happy completely in the moment you would have no need for hope.<br>  <br>  For hope is an obstruction to happiness and contetment.<br>  <br>  There is no tomorrow, there is only the rich worship of today.<br>  <br>  Its good to have an end to the journey towards, but it is the journey that matters in the end.<br>  <br>  The past is dead, the future is imaginary, happiness can only be in the eternal now moment.<br>  <br>  Why destroy your present happiness by a distant misery, which may never come at all.<br>  <br>  The only way to deal with the future is to function in the now.<br>  <br>  Everything that you need exists in this present moment, and this moment is all that exists.<br>  <br>  Desire wants what it does not have.  Freedom is the uncovering of what has always been there.<br>  <br>  What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.<br>  <br>  There is only this.<br>  <br>  Becoming does not contain being.<br>  <br>  Experience is a barrier to the state of experiencing.

Then there is no duality.  Do you see this?<br>  <br>  There is only the ending of something, not becoming something.<br>  <br>  Eternity is nothing more than the moment fully experienced.<br>  <br>  The past is a corpse, don’t go through life carrying a casket on your back.<br>  <br>  A living thing cannot be examined, only that which is dead can be examined.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow only exists when I want to be something I’m not.  <br>  <br>  The past is like a shawdow, making things dull and weary, in that shadow, the present looses its clarity, its freshness, and tomorrow is the continuation of the shadow.<br>  <br>  The desire for repetition arrises only when there is no joy today, when today  is empty, we look at the past or to the future.<br>  <br>  Can the mind look with an eye that is never tainted by the past.<br>  <br>  When you are trying to become, in various directions, then you are denying being.|`|33vnjuGraa	Hope is the feeling you have that the feeling you have isn't permanent.

With that said if your not a Professional and have not taken any classes in art and it still looks good it would sale.<br>  <br>  Starting at ￡12.00 is a good price to start off.<br>  Nice work by the way.<br>  Hope your sale does well.
W1h3w5gdaa	Changing strings shouldn't require a truss rod adjustment UNLESS the reason you're getting it adjusted is because you're changing string gauge. If this IS the reason you're getting the adjustment, you'll need to have the new strings on before the adjustment.<br>  <br>  If this is NOT the reason for the adjustment, then you should change the strings afterward.<br>  <br>  The cost of the procedure can vary widely, but since there's no parts involved it will be a matter of paying labor costs. Labor rates are always negotiable, so negotiate.<br>  <br>  That being said, as I understand it from a luthier friend of mine, a truss rod adjustment should take several days. This is because the adjustment should me made, then checked on a day later after the wood has settled. Another adjustment will probably be needed, requiring another day of wood relaxation (ahahahaha!!)<br>  <br>  And finally, just bring your strings to the store and ask them to install them for you. They ought to do it for free if you're getting other stuff done.<br>  <br>  Best!

Don't you know more than anything he wants you to be proud of him? Please don't keep hurting your son. This shows poor parenting on your part and undue fears. Try to relax and take in the fact your son is focused on a singing program and not out doing drugs, robberies or having wild parties. He sounds like a good kid. Be glad for that.<br>  Not that it should matter but in due time its highly likely his voice will change. It happens to boys. Meanwhile even if it never changed, so what?

Do you really want that?|`|eXz0xCXOaa	First of all, I can tell you that just because he sings high, doesn't mean he's gay. The best reason for this (and it's fairly common) is that he hasn't completed puberty.

This is basically Nihilism in a nutshell.  Now think about this.  By our laws of physics everything is the result of something else.  It is an action reaction kind of world.  Everything that happens is just a reaction of another action, and when it takes place it causes something else to happen.  So where does this leave room for freewill.  By these laws everything that we do is the reaction of something else.  Every time we move or speak or do anything, even if it feels like we choose to, is in fact the reaction of two chemicals or more that happen to react (it is much more complicated than this, but stick with me).  So how do we choose.  Choice means something coming from nothing.  It means something creates a reaction, out of....what?  So where does choice come from?  Or does it exist?|`|LBxHpNgaaa	I think you're full of it. U wish u could believe nothing exists. Maybe you're tired of following the rules. Or maybe you just find it fascinating to able to have a different opinion, I know I do. Truth of the matter is this.. time rules your world!.. everyone's world @ that. When you wake you check the time cause time will determine your next move. Did you wake up early? ok. Now you have some time to lay in bed some more or get ready a little slower. Wake up late? Aww snap! Better hurry! or you'll be late to school or work. Ha! of course there's consequences you'll pay 4 that. Damn that time huh! Gosh this is fun!...I can go on! Time determines when you eat, when you are late 4 a meeting, when you go to your next class, when you get off school, or get off work. Time determines what you can eat, you gotta cook right. Try eating a steak that you know only spent 1 minute on a grill. I doubt you will right! Yeah I know I'm right...lets see...what else...Time determines birth, time indicates safety....Gosh! you get the point I'm sure, even if you rather not admit it. I'm sure by now this makes sense. You know that the past has already happened, future time is approaching, & the present..well that is always changing isn't it cause soon the future will be present & what you thought was present timing is now the past.<br>  Of course there is a difference between reality & fantasy!<br>  Fantasy = you want to believe time is not real<br>  Reality = Time is real & you live by it<br>  I'm with you on the zero is something.<br>  Yes maybe another world can exist, who really knows?<br>  Be glad that you are where you are and can see touch feel hear & taste what you can, why worry about whether or not you really exist.<br>  I don't believe in after life just like you, but who cares what we believe...I'll tell you who! You & I..or at least that's the only 1 you can be sure of you know cares.<br>  Bottom line...believe what you want & don't believe whatever you want. No one lives your life but you....why not have fun & enjoy. Not believing seems soooo gloomy! Cheer up! :)

If your great aunt is a child in the family, then the husband is the normal head of house.. and the relationships shown are based on HIM. So, the mother would be his wife, and the H probably stands for homemaker (although I have never seen this myself).

If you have read the play carefully and understand it, and you have been looking at other notes (Cliff notes, Sparknotes, etc.), then I'm sure your answers are fine.<br>  Most of these questions are clearly in the text, for example, "9. 9. What is the nurse’s advice to Juliet? 12. 12. What is Romeo’s punishment for killing Tybalt?" These answers are self-evident in the script.<br>  <br>   If you have read the play but you don't understand what you have read, try reading it in the format of Shakespeare Made Easy or No Fear Shakespeare, which both have a modern text beside the original.|`|xaz6JieUaa	because he don' t like romeo
VMVW3E7Aaa	PaintShopPro is a very nice program. I started out using PSP, but it frustrated me that nearly every tutorial or downloadable "goodie" was for Photoshop, nothing for PSP.<br>  <br>  I think that situation has improved a little, though. If you're happy with the amount of support you can find for PSP, then go ahead and buy it - it isn't all the expensive, after all.<br>  <br>  They are pretty similar, but PSP looks much more polished.
8IqgfXl9aa	Okay, rating......8 1/2. <br>  Here's why:<br>  GOOD THINGS<br>  I really like 'burning, agonizing in blazing heat'. 'Was it so powerful'.....not so much. Get rid of that part so the line just reads, 'burning, agonizing in blazing heat.'<br>  You have really good word selection. 'Relentless, dominant, potent, intoxicating, throbbing......all really great words. <br>  I like 'scarcely there, drifting to the back pit of my mind'. Excellent. <br>  BAD THINGS<br>  'Tingling' as the last word isn't very powerful. I was kind of thinking maybe you could replace' tingling' with 'gone like the hush of the wind'.....but if you don't like it, don't use it. <br>  TOO. MANY. METAPHORS! 'Insignificant, like a tiger next to a mouse....', 'throbbing now, like the beat of my heart dancing to loud music....', 'intoxicating like the aroma of a dangerous addiction.....', it might be okay if you used metaphors every sentence, or every other sentence, or in some kind of pattern, but you don't. They're spread out, and just kind of all over the place. Switch some of the sentences so that there is some kind of pattern with those. <br>  No offense.....but it's a little too.....typical. I can tell from this writing that you have amazing potential, but I feel like you're trying to write what everybody else writes; kinda emo, dark poetry. Maybe try a different form. Or if you really feel like this is the kind of stuff that you should be writing, improve it so that it is waaaaay beyond 'typical'. <br>  <br>  I also think that this could definitely be considered a poem. <br>  I hope I helped, keep up with poetry.|`|8DR51W48aa	It's prety good!

MXMMlSJPaa	Think of the task and activities that will make you happy and fulfill.
WshwHtk9aa	That seems about right.<br>  However, it doesn't make sense because it violates itself. <br>  <br>  Point one is that EVERY event must have a cause separate from itself, but Conclusion one is that SOMETHING must be its own cause or else there could be no subsequent chain of causes and events. That conclusion simply cannot be made from the actual arguments that precede it. It is a leap of faith and a logical break.<br>  <br>  So point one must be amended to read "MOST" or "ALMOST EVERY event has a cause separate from itself..."<br>  But once you rewrite it that way - ostensibly to account for a God - you no longer necessarily need a God because you've stated that not all things need an outside cause. Therefore, there is no longer any need to invoke a God to be that initial cause. <br>  <br>  Either it is EVERY event or it is MOST events, it cannot be both. And if it is EVERY event, then even God, by the argument's own logic, must have a cause outside itself. If it is MOST events, then there is no need for a specific starting force for any chain. A God could indeed be one explanation of a self-starting chain, but so, too, could a godless event (like the Big Bang) at that point. Once you open the door to a self-starting event, there is no way from the arguments to limit that self-starting event to a God, but you must open it to self-starting events if you want there to be a God at all.<br>  <br>  You either close it off to any possibility (which prevents God) or you open it up to some possibility (which opens the door for just as many non-God explanations as godly ones).|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	NO it does not make any sense because the conclusion has no logical connection to any of the arguments which are extremely poor anyway!<br>  It all goes wrong wrong at part 3 definitely, but part 1-2 are really on shaky foundations also.<br>  <br>  The funny thing in your argument is that just because you can't comprehend eternity and causality you assume there is a great fairy in the sky. Is that supposed to be logic!? <br>  <br>  and anyway what makes you assume that there isn't an endless sequence of events? even if we live in a universe that had a start there may well be an infinite sequence of events outside the universe!|`|ZWzcrdn0aa	This is simply the discredited "First Cause Argument" warmed over.  <br>  <br>  The souffle falls apart from the start.  Having asserted in 1 that all events are caused, you proceed to refute your own premise.  In an apparent effort to avoid the trap of an endless chain of antecedent causes, you substitute the word "events".  A cause by any other name...  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, 3 doesn't follow from 2 -- you simply assert a fact not in evidence, the equivalent of "...and then a miracle occurs."<br>  <br>  What remains is wishful thinking in your conclusions.  What does it mean to be "uncaused"?  Which event "must cause itself to exist", how would you decide, what would demand that any one event could not have an antecedent?  Finally, nothing in your argument leads deductively to "Thus God Exists".<br>  <br>  The whole problem of the existence of God argument is that "existence" implies that God is bound within time-space.  Paul Tillich plucked God from that box by defining God as "the ground of being".|`|I54FE7iSaa	That's the cosmological argument all right, but it doesn't make sense.|`|DkxhdnrJaa	your number 1 is correct, every event must have a cause separate from itself<br>  <br>  im not so sure about your number 2. its almost there, but i would say that the point is that if every event has a cause, then the causes themselves must have causes before them, stretching back as far as can be imagined. <br>  <br>  3 is purely that Aquinas felt that it could not be true that this sequence could go back infinitely, because he felt that the universe had to have a beginning point. <br>  <br>  Therefore in order for there to be a single point of beginning, the first event could not have had a cause, otherwise it wouldn't be the first. <br>  <br>  Aquinas said that only god could be this uncaused event, who went on to cause all other future events.|`|CVp45z0kaa	I agree with 1. because everything begins with a thought, the universe is mental.<br>  I think 2. makes some sense because everything effects everything in some way weather directly or indirectly.<br>  For 3. I don't think we can know for sure because we ourselves aren't endless but that doesn't mean the sequence of events will end with us, we are just another link in a much greater chain of events.<br>  <br>  My conclusion is that God Most High definitely exists as the cause and end to everything|`|AA11839730	Your conclusions drawn assume that time is linear, if time is not linear, then the conclusions fail completely - as do your arguments in the first place since an event can be it's own cause.|`|lVHqoNVEaa	Why not just quote exactly what Aquinas said.|`|bxlYleZkaa	None of what you are stating has anything to do with anything called god.|`|A01w1dHqaa	God cut through that Gordian knot with: I am that I am.

MHFuJGdGaa	Most porn agencies require monthly STI testing.  Most documentaries on the industry reference a database which each porn star must submit to which keeps track of any STI's past or present.  As a male, you tend to start out in gay porn.  The money is good, but often it seems so many porn stars who want to "jump" to legitimate acting are lacking in talent and training.

It's like asking a doctor a question rather than asking your friend. Regular  readers can sense that something sounds right or wrong.   But another writer knows the anatomy of writing.  They can tell you what's wrong, why it's wrong, and suggest how to fix it.  A good writer welcomes healthy criticism and understands that the WORK is being critiqued, not the person who wrote it.
QZi5htAPaa	Start off talking about the weather because it impacted people's lives back then even more so than now. If you want it in summer or something  you could talk about how hot it is outside and the flies everywhere and say something about how your sister fainted today because of the heat or something. That sister could be the one in later entries that has the plague and dies. You might want to say something about a tax collector or something coming and demanding money and you being really poor and hungry and how you don't like having to pay tribute to the king but thats the way things are so oh well. I dunno, just try to kep it fairly simple and go about the daily goings on in your life. What you had for dinner, how your friend george almost got trampled by a cart at the marketplace, etc, etc.

y8bFwXZEaa	No. We have the hard wiring that allows us to extrapolate metaphysical entities from physical entities. We then integrate two or more of them into concepts, and by putting concepts together in chains we can comprehend the world, invent language, develop math and philosophy, and understand Aristotle's "Logicos", the rules of which have held true for 3500 years.<br>  <br>  If everyone understood "Logicos" they would know that of 72 hard-wired methods for the brain to think with, 60 always lead to wrong answers.<br>  <br>  Remember, when someone says, "Think outside the box," it is impossible to think outside those 72 "moods and figures" of logic.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Yes.

You could make a goal that you want to compete in more competitions and want to make a finish in the top 3. Do you have any new ideas for styles of dance that your team could perform? You can make a goal to get your team involved in the community, by doing fund raisers (we did a car wash), perform in a local parade, do a day camp for elementary school girls, etc. Just make a list of goals you would like to see for the team and expand on those and I promise you will be able to answer those questions!|`|8dlxCanCaa	You can say something like "I want to bring the girls on the team to make us more of a family." If your school is anything like mine, then the dance team has a few catty girls on it that could be more respectful to some other girls on the team. Something else you could say would be "I want to bring more technique to the team to make us overall, better dancers." If they ask you why you want to be captain then you can talk about your expirience, being courageous, hard-working, ect (if these are true about you lol). Good luck with your dance team!!!!<br>  =]

W5jET3ilaa	I believe that Ronald Cummings is guilty of something. I think he is hiding something and just coaching his young girlfriend of what to do and say. His family is also too defensive on interviews and they seem to support Misty, the girlfriend, even though she's given so many conflicting stories of the event. I don't trust the Cummings until I'm proven wrong. Their actions and reactions are just not normal to me.
mRulboA7aa	Did you mean to post this in the art section?  If so, here is your answer:<br>  Romanticism has two 'looks'.<br>  1) Outdoor scenery.  This is also called 'chocolate box art'. It is very corny and does not mean to show anything more than what the naked eye can see. A good example would be if you can find an image of a mountain or the countryside on a chocolate box.<br>  2) Sometimes outdoor but sometimes have actual subject matters like people as well.  The most important elements of this is: lots of movement, very dramatic scenes, often a lot of red.  A good example would be a portrait of wild horses running off a mountain, kicking up a lot of dust.  The whole image will have a lot of movement in eg. the clouds.
4d7a505fc805e5e150f1338f65257de1aa	The Germans were upset because of the Versaille Treaty after WWI. Their country was having to pay mass reparations, land had been taken from them, and they were unable to build a strong army.  Additionally, the Great Depression was taking place.  The economy in Germany was doing horrible because of inflation.  There particularly was overproduction in grain in Europe.  For years, people were unhappy with their way of life.  Then came Hitler. He offered a way to boost the economy and make people happy.<br>  <br>  He began getting power through propaganda and making huge speeches about fixing the problems of Germany.  The people followed him.  He also said that the population of Germany was getting too big and so they needed to get rid of some people.  Hitler blamed many of Germany's misfortunes on the Jews and other people who weren't of the Aryan race.  In an effort to fix these problems Hitler wanted to get rid of them.  He began making Jews wear the star of David and people ostracized them.  Soon they were taken to Ghettos and concentration camps.  Hitler wanted to get rid of all the misfits and those who were "not as good" as the Aryan race.|`|suxCcXkAaa	Downtrodden Germans had rallied around Adolf Hitler, their new leader, who called for Aryan redemption after Germany's humiliation in World War I and launched an aggressive campaign to "unify" the German race throughout Europe.<br>  <br>  In "unifying" the Aryan race, Hitler also meant to eradicate those who didn't fall under that category.

PiTFpjWqaa	Short answer: no.<br>  <br>  A GCSE is an academic qualification, even though there may be a practical element to it. If speaking terms of technique only, GCSE dance will be a walk in the park for you if you're so well trained in ballet. But GCSE is not just about how good a dancer you are. It involves learning about all different kinds of dance, not just the one you do - and writing, reading and applying knowledge about it to coursework and/or exams. <br>  <br>  I guess what I am trying to say is that they cannot in any way be compared or claimed to be the same qualification. If you enjoy ballet then I'm pretty sure it will be an advantage in the GCSE course. Likewise, learning about dance in general will probably help you in your ballet training! <br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision.
w8gBWpKTaa	Park bench! Turn the 'bench' into anything from a broom cupboard to a beach and just get up there and improvise a scene. People watching can jump in at any time by tagging someone already in and just changing the scene. It's good fun :)|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I'm in a show right now, and our director taught us this game. It doesn't have a name, really, but you can call it the sticks game if you like. The leader (your teacher, probably) has two big wooden sticks, and bangs them together rhythmically while the participants move around the space randomly in time to the tapping. (Crawl, hop, pretend to fly, limp, whatever.) The participants should always be looking at something in the room. When he/she is ready, the leader taps the sticks a certain number of times, and the participants behave accordingly.<br>  <br>  *1 TAP - freeze, and change levels. For example, if you're crawling, you could move to a crouch, or stand on your tiptoes.<br>  *2 TAPS - move to your focus point, the thing you were last looking at, and interact with it somehow. For example, if you were looking at a pole, you could go swing around it.<br>  *3 TAPS - freeze, make eye contact with someone else in the room, and begin playing the mirror game from where you are.<br>  *4 TAPS - you must be in physical contact with another person. I'm in college, so we usually end up with some interesting scenarios, but for high school you'll want to make more specific rules about what contact is and isn't appropriate.<br>  *5 TAPS - move to the four corners of the space. This divides the participants into 4 groups.<br>  *6 TAPS - one person from each group poses, and the rest of the group members quickly pose with them and freeze. The leader picks the most interesting still life, and everyone else goes and sits around them, and makes suggestions about what they are. Then, that group improvises a scene.<br>  <br>  Of course, they can go in any order, though 5 must always come before 6.<br>  <br>  This game is beneficial because it reinforces the idea of being comfortable moving through a space in a variety of ways, and on a variety of levels. It helps you be at ease interacting with and touching your fellow actors, and strengthens your improvisation abilities.|`|mVR5WmDoaa	let them stand in a circle.<br>  tell them 2 take a step and say a number...one at a time<br>  so someone would step and say "one" then another would say "two" there is no order of the people. if 2 people say a number at the same time, start over. its fun and i played this a lot when i was on set and at my theatre group.|`|s115uaybaa	do drills where you go out into the hall and start yelling things to see if the school is ready for certain situations such as "there is a fire!" or "pedophile in the school! everyone out!"

Bram Stoker.|`|gZnKQI60aa	If you are looking for a great vampire book most of the work of Anne Rice is a great place to start. As far as vampire fiction goes she has been crowned the undisputed queen to the best of my knowledge. Before I ever read "Twilight" I was a huge Anne Rice fan and as much as I loved Stephanie Meyer's books, Rice's are a cut above them.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you start at the beginning and read "Interview with a Vampire", that's the first of her vampire chronicles series. It tells the story of Louis, a wealthy frenchman of New Orleans who is turned into a vampire by Rice's most popular character Lestat (the main character of most of the series). If you like that one she has so many more wonderful vampire tales.|`|uCS0AUquaa	Susan Sizemore - Laws of the Blood<br>  Jeaniene Frost - halfway to the grave<br>  Christine Feehan- The Carpathians<br>  Nina Bangs - funny<br>  Nora Roberts - Circle Trilogy<br>  Lynsay Sands - funny<br>  Angela Knight - mageverse - sex<br>  Lynn Kurland- time travel<br>  Janet Chapman<br>  Sherrilyn Kenyon - dark, sexy<br>  Karen Marie Moning - violence, sex<br>  Christina Dodd<br>  Brenda Joyce - Masters of time - action<br>  JR Ward - Brotherhood of the Black Dagger -sexy, violent<br>  Lynn Viehl - The Darkyn - sexy<br>  <br>  <br>  All of the above are favorite authors of mine, many are paranormal writers or have paranormal stories among their offerings.|`|PsarWirtaa	1. it's chosen then hunted in the house of night!<br>  2. the books i would say are:<br>  the last vampire (there's six)<br>  the midnighters|`|cfzJ1DLlaa	Have you ever read Bram Stoker's Dracula?<br>  It's a classic, and somewhat eh, but all the same still very good.|`|pEDavW3caa	you should read ann rice's books. or maybe cirque de freak|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	The Morganville Vampire Series are great for mature teens. <br>  <br>  The Sookie Stackhouse series are also amazing but it's an adult series and has multiple sex scenes in the first book, so if you're not mature enough to handle a handful of sex scenes and a little more sophisticated vocabulary then you should consider not reading it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TjjPm5P1aa	Depends on the Age group... <br>  <br>  To Older Teens and Adults I would recommend...<br>  <br>  The Southern vampire series by Charlaine Harris.(aka. Sookie Stackhouse series.) 9 books so far, next book releases May 2009 Includes many different supernatural beings (werewolves, Vampires, Shapeshifters, faries) . It is very good! HBO's True Blood Series is based off this series. (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  The Anita Blake- Vampire Hunter Series by Laurell Hamilton. 16 books so far I believe. If you like Southern vampires series, you will definately like this one too. Along the same lines however Anita Blake is one tough cookie! (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  Vampire Academy Series- by Richelle Mead- Vampire Academy, Frostbite, shadow kiss (next one comes out in August 2009). Very good series! Would classify this as older teens and up. Very entertaining! (main characters are 17 years old)<br>  <br>  Black Dagger Brotherhood Series- by .R. Ward- 6 books. First one is Dark Lover. About 6 extreamly tough warrior vampires. Each book is based on a different brother however they should still be read in order. I would classify this as adult due to the sex scenes but an older teen would definately enjoy it as well. (main character is in her mid 20's)<br>  <br>  The House of Night Series- by P.C. Cast & Kristin Cast- Marked, Betrayed, Chosen, Untamed (next book comes out 3/10/09) Also a very good series. Teens and older would enjoy this. Has romance and action. Must read in order. (main character is 17 years old)<br>  <br>  For Young Adults, I would recommend...<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series- by Melissa De La Cruz- Blue Bloods, Masquerade, Revelations (next book comes out 9/1/09). Main characters are in high School.<br>  <br>  Night Word Series- by L.J. Smith- 3 volumes so far that have three books a piece in them. The stories are all interlinked in one way or another in the "Night World" however the same characters dont tend to repeat between the stories. The world stays the same but i think of them as all seperate books. Each book was entertaining though. Main characters are in high school.<br>  <br>  Vampire Kisses Series by Ellen Schreiber- 5 books so far- next book coming out in the summer of 2009. main characters are in high school.<br>  <br>  The Vampire Diaries Series by L.J. Smith- 4 books so far- Main characters are in high school.|`|GL95xSFXaa	Before I read Twilight, I read The Vampire Diaries by L.J. Smith.

Mig6O93Naa	Yeah, you are doing it all wrong. How old are you? IF you are under 18, your parents have to help you and sign for you. Places that want you to pay or buy something are scams.  YOu don't need an agent until you have a resume that will interest the agent. AGents do not make actors.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Consider this:  If I were to be a surgeon, would you expect me to practice medicine straight out of high school?  No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines. Sense memory, Emotive memory, Place work, and moment-to-moment technique are all building blocks in a complex system developed by Stanislavsky modified by Strasberg, and near perfected by Meisner, which are MANDATORY to be a talented actor.  Marlon Brando did not wake up one day knowing how to act.   <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love." So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.

If you go on amazon to buy it, you should buy it from amazon directly, and don't link down to the cheaper versions that other people or companies are selling.<br>  <br>  Some small companies have accounts set up for the guilty pirating people. I know www.rifftrax.com does this, since their product is easy-to-steal online. They have a paypal set up specifically for people who feel guilty for stealing, haha. Check the website of your anime series, to see if they have anything similar, or email to suggest they set up an account like that for people like you.<br>  <br>  Hope this answer helps you out!|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Go to any local store that sells DVDs, look there for it, but it if it's there. If that fails, go to amazon.com or ebay, buy it there. The anime, or the company that made the anime, might have a website you can go to. I'm sure there will be a place to donate money to it. For every dvd of the anime that is bought, a portion of the profits goes to the company that made the anime. That's how it helps.|`|C2FkuVESaa	You could go to the website of the creators and purchase the DVDs or mangas, instead of stealing from them and taking away from them their means of living. Remember, those of us who survive on writing, making music, and such have to survive. If you just steal our work, we can't make money off of it and then have to seek other sources of income. If you watch these illegally, you're hurting the person who made them, and possibly helping to drive them into no longer being able to produce it.

It’s called the dumbbell concentration curl.<br>  <br>  The person responsible to making the dumbbell concentration curl popular is none other than Arnold Schwarzeneggar. This exercise will result in toning and giving a nice roundness to the biceps.<br>  <br>  Here’s how to go about it:<br>  <br>  Firstly, sit yourself on a chair or on a bench. Next, place your feet comfortably slightly wider than your shoulder line, with your lower legs and feet on a slightly outward angle.<br>  <br>  Grip a dumbbell on one hand and have your arm hanging down in between your legs next to the tight with the same side leg of which you are holding your dumbbell.<br>  <br>  At your waist, bend over while maintaining your back and spine and straight as possible. Brace the rear of your upper arm against and inside of your thigh, while maintaining the level above the knee while gripping the dumbbell in the lowered position.<br>  <br>  Breathe a full breath and tighten your abdominal muscles. Take note to breathe out on exertion. Next curl the dumbbell upwards and then squeeze.<br>  <br>  Lower the dumbbell again slowly. While the weight is being lowered, control the weight. Also ensure that that the rear of your upper arm is steadfastly braced against your thigh. Repeat again the whole process.<br>  <br>  Be careful not to use your knees to leverage them for the curl. By doing so, it is defeating all purpose and is not as effective as it suppose to be. Many people tend to make this mistake by resting their elbows on the knees to leverage it.<br>  <br>  The second mistake to avoid is to swing the dumbbell. Some people tend to use too much weight that they can handle. Thus, they cheat by swinging the dumbbell to gain momentum. This mistake again reduces the effectiveness of this exercise by reducing the tension of the biceps.<br>  If that doesn't work i read a book that said jumping rope helps too. If your a girl you can do girls on the run or girls on the track and eat healthier things and drink healthy things too.

AflFFMHtaa	In my opinion, Snowball teaches the other animals to read so they are not alienated from the smarter animals and then taken advantage of. I think Snowball (Trotsky) saw, right from the start, how easily Old Major's (Lenin) guidelines could be used so that one group could rule others. Snowball teaching the other animals to read was his act of trying to save them. Unfortunately, those who benefited from his act of kindness were unable to use it to overthrow Napoleon- in particular Benjamin.|`|XqmQa50Oaa	I'd say the importance is that the fact that the pigs can read the best distinguishes them from the other animals. After they can read, they can change the rules and they become the most powerful animal.|`|WshwHtk9aa	If you know why, prove it by telling us your theory.

OMG LOL I love Edward. Go TEAM CULLEN! SNOWBALL LOVED JACOB! BOOO!|`|AA10018551	Snowball = Leon Trotsky<br>  <br>  Leon Trotsky fought with Stalin for power and lost. He was kicked out of Russia, just like Snowball was kicked out of Animal Farm. He was supposedly more pure in his ideology than Stalin. Snowball, too, was concerned for the ideals of Animalism set forth by old Major. He even taught them to the other animals, rather than trying to keep them in the dark, wallowing in their ignorance like intellectual hippopotami.<br>  <br>  By teaching animals to read, Snowball was trying to empower the lower classes to think for themselves, to be able to stay true to the original principles of Animalism, and to be able to call out the pigs when they change their rules or mantras .
dQmFoRRiaa	You have met the technical requirements of the quatern form, viz. eight-syllable lines and an initial line that marches forward through each of the ensuing quatrains.  Your grammar is somewhat obscure in a couple of places, though the meaning of your poem, one of looking to God -- 'the Light or illumination' -- as a way forward through the world, and as a release from ignorance is clear enough, not only because of the connectedness of your thought but because it is a familiar literary motif.  If I were re-working this poem, I would devote more attention to the directness of the grammar, unpacking it a bit for the reader.  Also, you haven't much here in the way of ornaments, alliteration for example, and they would improve the aural texture of your poem.  This is a lovely poem on a traditional theme, and I know a young lady of your talent and devotion will want to make it a statement of belief, and love.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	this is very stiff. <br>  remember to bring a little magic into your words,

AA10015648	A Calling is basically what the soul feels like they should do, as a job. If they feel like they are called to teach, then they will teach. If they feel like they are called to heal, then they become Healers. Since there is no money to be earned in their society, people just do jobs in order to help. Any soul without a job is not contributing to the society, and wouldn't really belong... so there are no souls without jobs :D<br>  <br>  Souls are aliens, and to live on Earth, they have to be implanted into human heads. So, the Seeker and Healer at the begging are people, aliens AND souls, lol No wonder you were confused :P <br>  <br>  The people she describes are humans, with souls in them, and there are definitely no humans helping the souls take over the human race. Any human without a soul mentioned in this book is referred to as "wild" or a "rebel" human.|`|bE49YvbWaa	1) that's the special job that the aliens are meant to do. for example the seeker and the healer.<br>  2) aliens. theyre not actually humans but the souls inhabit and control human bodies so when she sees or hears one walking towards her it is a human body, it's just got a soul inside of it.|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	Good questions! :)|`|v0fYl6pHaa	oooo im starting to read that book but havent got very far yet! x0x0x|`|gxczXgvXaa	A Calling is really just what the souls call a job.

d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	This is a very poorly worded question: Both A and B are somewhat true, while C and D are clearly wrong . The revolution deposed the provisional government, and Russia negotiated for peace with Germany, not the Allies.<br>  The thing is, neither A nor B happened right after the October Revolution.

iNXqiDIYaa	Nine-year-old Lenny Brewster is captivated by the world – the mysteries of machines, the magic of snow, the pure joy of a perfect ride down a slippery slide. He knows a lot, but not how to share it with others. Of course, it doesn’t help having an absent father, a preoccupied mother, and a teacher and peers who don’t like him. Lenny spends much of his time in the principal’s office or alone, absorbed in his ideas. Then he meets Van, a kindred spirit, and Muriel, the canny school therapist. Their simple acceptance of Lenny helps him find his place at last.
w8gBWpKTaa	That's a well good question. When I first saw it. I thought you meant in the sense that we're all related... <br>  I don't think so though, there's so many people in the world|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	We are a lot closer than that.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is more easily understandable if one considers the actual structure of an atom and the scale and placement of its components.  If one takes into account the fact that the neutrons and protons form a dense cluster at the center of the atom and that the electrons orbit in such a way that huge spaces exist between them and the nucleus it becomes clear that the atoms that make up seemingly solid objects are made up of 99+ percent empty space at any given moment.<br>  <br>  This alone does not seem too important until you add the idea that the atoms that make up many seemingly solid objects are more of a loose conglomeration that share a similar attraction but never really touch each other.<br>  <br>  At first glance this does not really seem relevant, but closer analysis reveals that this adds a tremendous amount of empty space to solid objects that are already made up of atoms that could be thought of as 99 percent space. When so-called solid objects are seen in this light it becomes apparent that may not be the seemingly solid objects they appear to us to be.<br>  <br>  We ourselves are not exceptions to this phenomenon.<br>  <br>  These seemingly solid objects are more like ghostly images that we interpret as solid objects based on our perceptual conclusions. <br>  <br>  From this one could conclude that Perception is some sort of a trick that helps us to take these ghostly images and turns them into a world we can associate and interact with. This clever device seems to be a creation of our intellect that enables us to interact with each other in what appears to be a three dimensional reality.<br>  <br>  I want to add that this is based on my own personal way of looking at the situation and was never intended to be a physics lesson.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love and blessings Don|`|BsoMNu36aa	I think yes... and my reasoning is that connectedness is a concept, it comes from the mind and so can theoretically be infinite... that is, how far you go with connecting me to a kid I knew in the third grade who later became a doctor in new york who once sat next to a guy in a movie theatre, who once lived in india, who gave a little girl there a dollar, who... etc etc etc is only limited by my attention span for tracking, and researching every meaningless connection I or my friends have ever made.

If it's cold where you live dress in layers in case you get hot during dancing.  Have a short sleeve shirt, then a nice zip up, and a regular jacket.

b3e84b9579e9f3c8f36fd3f2affca04baa	Twilight Apple-The apple on the cover of Twilight represents "forbidden fruit." I used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology—look how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture. To me it says: choice.<br>  <br>  New Moon Flower- That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning... If you've read the Twilight FAQ, you know that the apple cover had a lot of meaning for me, and I was an active part of the covering process. However, that experience is more the exception than the rule in the publishing world. Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So I don't know what the tulip means—I didn't have anything to do with this one.<br>  <br>  Eclipse Ribbon-I'm really not sure.  I know the newborn vampire Riley is the one who took Bella's red shirt, so I'm sure it's because it's red.<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn Chess Pieces-Breaking Dawn's cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga. She began as the weakest (at least physically, when compared to vampires and werewolves) player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen. In the end, it's Bella that brings about the win for the Cullens.|`|VUfT35UQaa	Twilight : According to the author Stephenie Meyer, the apple on the cover is meant to represent the forbidden fruit from the book of Genesis in the Bible. It is also a symbol of Bella and Edward’s forbidden love, and represents choice. The similarity between the forbidden love and the forbidden fruit is further reinforced by the quote from Genesis 2:17 that opens the book.<br>  <br>  Stephenie Meyer has stated that the flower on the cover of New Moon has no significance to the story, as she had no part in choosing its design. This is stated on her website under the "New Moon : FAQ" heading However, some fans have theories like the "flower is drooping because their love is failing" and "the white and red mean Bella is adjusting to vampire life." Some say "the flower drop means that drop of blood in the beginning of New Moon that changed everything"<br>  The title refers to the darkest phase of the lunar cycle, indicating that New Moon is about the darkest period of Bella's life.<br>  <br>  <br>  The book jacket features a torn red ribbon. Although it was supposed to be disclosed to the public in May 2007 at the Eclipse Prom, Barnes & Noble, Stephenie Meyer's official website premiered cover in March 2007, along with a preview summary of the book's plot. The broken ribbon represents choice, as in the book Bella must chose between her love for Edward Cullen, her vampire boyfriend, and her friendship/love with Jacob Black. Meyer also stated that the ribbon represents the idea that Bella can't break away completely from her human life.<br>  <br>  <br>  According to the author Stephenie Meyer, the cover of this book "is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire series. She began as the weakest (at least physically, when compared to vampires and werewolves) player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen. In the end, it's Bella that brings about the win for the Cullens."|`|5uzHW4CYaa	The apple represents the forbidden fruit.<br>  The crumpled flower is just what the publishers put on there to make it more appealing.<br>  The ribbon is new beginnings/end.<br>  The chess piece is the queen, which represents Bella Swan making her own choices and her own decisions.|`|kAqjxDHaaa	The apple on the cover of Twilight stands for Edward, the forbidden fruit, you might say. The flower, as far as I know, doesn't stand for anything, it's just a cool design. The ribbon stands for Bella breaking her ties to human life. And finally, the chess board represents Bella as she was before and after her transformation. Before, she was a pawn--not very significant. Now, she is the queen, a very important player in the game.<br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>   Have a good rest of the day!|`|TG7mwNRfaa	I wonder how many times this question has been asked....<br>  <br>  SEARCHBAR|`|FE4B8uynaa	Hey, whats up?<br>  Well Twilight's cover  means this in Meyers words.<br>  The apple on the cover of Twilight represents "forbidden fruit."

Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments.

It isn't exactly that, but close enough.<br>  The chess pieces are Bella starting off as a weak, human pawn, about to die from a baby, but in the end, it's her shield that saves them from the Volturi and she is the most powerful player in the game for the Cullen aka the Queen!|`|u9Ugt2qjaa	well, the apple and the hand represent the time that Edward caught Bella's apple in the cafeteria, the flower is red and white you know, and I think the red part of the flower (Bella) is falling off of the white part (Edward) because she is sort of wilting. Also, the ribbon is breaking, so that represents the breaking of friendships for some people in the story. I don't know about the chess board, though. Sorry, but I hope this helps!|`|pEDavW3caa	well i'm not really sure about new moon or eclipse. for twilight it was kind of ironic when the movie came out and there was an apple involved.anyway for breaking dawn i read from the stephenie meyer website and it's so suppose to represent bella.  bella was suppose to be that little pawn in the back representing when she was powerless and useless. but later she became a queen representing the time she helped the family defeat the volturi. it's like from useless to powerful.<br>  <br>  hope it helps!|`|TyrWoM5Gaa	The apple represents the forbidden fruit also both evil and good.<br>  The crumpled flower means how much time you have till you die. Because The Flower Is Dieing Quickly And You Only Have So Much Time In Your Life To!<br>  The ribbon is new beginnings and ends.<br>  The chess piece is the queen, which represents Bella Swan making her own choices and her own decisions. Also its in the book when Edward beats Alice at chest and Jasper beats Bella at chest.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Alice Cullen :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Alice Cullen.|`|sUgrGy78aa	I love Twilight! YAY|`|nRvLXTJ7aa	let's just go with what they said :)) lol!|`|xMDBd4IUaa	Hello there...<br>  Well i heard the apple also stood for the forbidden fruit, like in adam&eve, because bella is with edward, which is kinda forbidden, and wouldnt of been aproved of, but they are drawn to each other like eve was drawn to the fruit.<br>  Then, im not sure what the second books covers about, but on the third one, the raveling ribbon which is torn, is suposed to represent choice, between her love for Edward and  her frienship/love thing for Jacob. Furthermore it also represents how Bella can never seperate completley from her human life.<br>  Finally in the fourth one, the coves is a metephor for Bellas progression through the entire book series/saga. At the beginning, she was weak and powerless like a pawn, but then, she eventually becomes the powerfullest piece on the board, (which is the Queen).<br>  hope this helps :D
IQTM0n0Taa	What is this agent for, acting or modeling?<br>  <br>  Your look is unique in a way, but you may want to clarify what that word means to your agent.

dQmFoRRiaa	Your meter is fine this time Jill, but you went and rhymed the last two lines, and it's supposed to be blank verse, hence unrhymed.  Your middle quatrain of free verse has five lines, one too many, but if you rearrange them into four lines and change might to can in line 11 you will have achieved a fine result.

It does have the iambic pentameter of a sonnet and rhymed  couplets in the opener, but that's its only similarity.  You've mastered it pretty well for a first attempt.  Kudos!

MHFuJGdGaa	I'm going to tell you what my highschool drama teacher told me before I shipped off to the Conservatory.<br>  <br>  "If at any point during your pursuit of acting you ever think you might want to do something else, for Christ's sake do it.  Acting is an unforgiving ***** who will never love you back.  Only those who have no other passion, who have blinders on, are ever stupid enough to follow through."|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Be a pilot.|`|hIhDvVtZaa	Garry G hit the nail on the head. Unless you are 100% sure that you can dedicate 100% of your time without expecting major roles, then try something else. If you love acting though, it should be enough to act without being famous. I know so many adults who loved acting, but knew that they could never make it as an actor or didn't want to risk it. since they can't give up such a big part of their life, they remain active in the theater community. You can always become a pilot, then do some community theater while you're in school and when you graduate, and if you are meant to be "discovered" then you will be. Acting truly is unforgiving, and so many people have destroyed their lives because they wanted the fame of an actor more than the acting part. Don't let that be you and just continue to do small time acting.

8asG4WCwaa	Real agents and real publishers do not look for authors on here. They don't advertise on here, either.  Scams do.<br>  <br>  All you have provided is your email, location, and your willingness to be scamed because you are underage, desparate, and uninformed about the publishing industry.  A scammer loves that. You might as well fork over the cash now.  <br>  <br>  If you are serious about writing, you will take a few years to learn how to write well before you start trying to get published.  Most teens can not write at the same level of skill and craft as more experienced adults.  Those adults have a hard time getting published as it is.  Teens have an even harder time and are frequent victims of publishing scams.  Reality bites :-)<br>  <br>  Worry about getting published after you write, finish, edit, get  critiqued, and edit the work again. No need to hurt your chances by sending work that is not actually ready to be 'out there'.  <br>  <br>  Grammar and spelling errors, plot holes, said-bookism and thesaraus-itis (do you know what those are?), and poor pacing and dialog need to be corrected.  You need to recognize a mary/gary stu character and what that means.  You want the quality of the story being told to be noticed, not it's problems in delivery.<br>  <br>  Even good novels get rejected.  Sometimes a lot.  That does not always mean the writing is bad.  It can mean the market is full or the agent/publisher already has already accepted very similar work.  If you get too many rejections, you have to decide if the work just isn't quite good enough and can be fixed, save it until the market changes, or should you move on to writing something else.  <br>  <br>  Many authors never did sell their first submitted novel, and that's okay.  Writing it was not a waste of time, it helped them improve their skills.  Some have gone back and reworked that first attempt and sold it later in their career. <br>   <br>  When you are ready to get published, you will need to know a lot more about the industry than you realize.  <br>  ---Is your work a short story?  Novelette? Novella? Novel?  To find out, you need to know it's word count and genre (the minimum length of a novel is 40,000 words, and many genres require twice that before they will consider it).  Do agents and publisger want short stories?  Novelettes? Novellas?<br>  ---Is it in proper manuscript format as per the submission guidelines of the agent or publisher you are considering?  Do you know how to write a query letter and synopsis?  Do you know what they are?<br>  ---What's a slush pile?  What does unsolicited manuscript mean?  <br>  ---What are MG and YA? Would your novel fit better into one of those categories? <br>  ---Do you know your work's market?  Is it open?  Flooded with similar work?  In decline?  What will the market look like in two years (publishers buy in a time warp)? <br>  ---Do you need an agent?  Do you know what an agent does besides sell manuscripts?  Do you know how to choose an appropriate agent or publisher for your work? What does an editor do? Is that different from an agent? <br>  ---Do you know the difference between publishing rights and copyrights? Do you know what the difference between an advance and a royalty is? Is there a difference? How to returns and remainders affect your royalties?  Do you know what returns and remainders are?  What are subsidiary rights? What is midlisting?<br>  ---Do you know the difference between traditional and self publishing?  <br>  ---What is the difference between hardback, trade cover, and mass market paperback?  How does the format affect the royalty rate? Distribution channels? <br>  ---Do you need to register a copyright for your work?  Will the agent do that?  Or the publisher? Should you make editorial changes to your work? What is a galley?  What's an advanced reader copy? <br>  ---Why does self publishing have a poor reputation in the industry?<br>  ---Can you spot a scam before it bites you? <br>  <br>  Don't rush in to getting published.  Spend your time wisely. Your school classes and library can be valuable in this.  Develop the skills of your craft and learn about it's industry.  Your chances of sucess are far greater if you do.  <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to discourage you, just help you see the bigger picture so that you do not end up a victim of a scam.<br>  <br>  You are 13, you have decades of time to get published in.  No need to hurry :-)|`|YorMkZYAaa	If you really think authors and publishers are on here scouting for new material to publish you are going to be waiting a long time. They have better things to do than look for unknown writers on sites like these.|`|fI4LqMVMaa	I'm not an author or a publisher, but I have a feeling you might get in trouble for a question like this. Worst case scenario you wont get what you're looking for: a publisher, at least not this way.  Publishers want you to do all of the work, and they aren't about to make things easy for you.  They have thousands of people who want them to publish their book, so they're not exactly desperete for authors.  In other words, they aren't going to come to you, you need to go to them and make your work stand out against all of the other submissions.  If you want to get published, here is what I recomend:<br>  <br>  "The Writer's Market" is the best resource I can suggest for an aspiring writer.<br>  <a href="http://www.writersmarket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersmarket.com/</a><br>  <br>  It can provide a lot of the resources that you will need and give you some guidance.<br>  <br>  Also, read Literary Marketplace (a thick book of literary agents). Look for those who specialize in your genre. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. Expect it to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. Thats just part of the business.<br>  <br>  You can also visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com/</a> to find an agent.<br>  <br>  In Order for your book to have a chance of publication:<br>  You’ll need to know how to write an effective ‘query letter’ to a literary agent. The letter will also include a synopsis of your book, preferably one that will hold the interest of the agent. The idea is to make him or her ask for the first couple of chapters of your work. Do not ever send a manuscript to a publisher or literary agent without sending your query letter first. <br>  <br>  You’ll also need to know how to format your manuscript. This includes the fonts (size and type) that most agents, editors, and publishers want. These are usually Courier New and Times New Roman (12 pt). Short stories and novels are formatted differently. You will need to follow submission guidelines just as they are laid down for your submissions. Anything less will result in your manuscript sent back or destroyed unread. <br>  <br>  One of the most important issues in manuscript submitting is the proper ‘page set up’ for your work. This includes margins, indents, and paragraphs. Most editors will want to see your manuscript double spaced. This allows the editor to use his/her proofreaders marks between the lines. Most margins will be one inch all around with a ragged right margin and an even left.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to hire an editor, remember: Your manuscript will be double spaced, which means there will be twice as many pages. A 600 page novel could cost you around $1800.00, some even more depending on what the editor charges per page. Then there’s the hourly rate that some charge. Usually it’s within the range of $65.00. So, if they work on your book for 18 hours, that’s another $1170.00 + $1800.00 = $2970.00<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a side note, it’s a good idea to know some of the publishing laws. The use of names and places. <br>  <br>  These include<br>  o Delivery Of Satisfactory Copy <br>  o Permission for Copyrighted Material <br>  o Grant Of Rights <br>  o Proofreading and Author's Corrections <br>  o Advances and Royalties <br>  o Author's Warranties and Indemnities <br>  o Copies to Author <br>  o Option Clause<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  ~Clarkie|`|AA10242125	Agents and publishers need a reason to be interested in you. See about writing a short story that someone would buy before you try to publish a book.|`|qDYzdz5daa	A writer who isn't willing to do the footwork to get himself published, and expects the publishers to do the work FOR him?<br>  <br>  Yeah, I don't see that happening.<br>  <br>  Try looking in the phone book under "agent."  You'll need one, if your self-marketing skills are really this bad.
IDRgZQKDaa	Well it certainly showed us a flaw of a less powerful federal government. The rebellion could stand up to militias, and so we needed a strong national army. This was one thing that helped shape the federalist structure of this country. On the other hand they killed, and a physical rebellion isn't such a great idea.

UxjvCDsraa	All of those figures were and remain extremely significant for the renaissance.  Essentially, Leonardo da Vinci encapsulated the renaissance through various tactics.  He was an artist, dabbling in different mediums such as sculpture, paint (the Mona Lisa ), etc, he was also a great thinker and conceptualized the calculator, helicopter, etc.  Without a doubt, da Vinci was a true renaissance man, one who exposed the masses to groundbreaking and spectacular ideas.  Similar to da Vinci, Michelangelo was an incredible artist (Sistine Chapel in Rome), and truly fit the archetype of a Renaissance Man, for he did not subject himself to a single field of expertise.  In fact, he was well-read, and was very proficient in mathematics and science.  Thomas More was an avid follower of humanism, an intellectual movement that gained momentum in Europe.  He was a lawyer, and without a doubt, an advocate for religious toleration.  For example, his most famous work, titled "Utopia" spoke of a Utopian island in which religious toleration existed, (however, in the grand tradition of Religion in European history, More did NOT support atheism).  It is with this work, that More fed the idea of secularism, in which institutions such as the government should be a completely separate entity from religion.  Ultimately, his avid belief in secularism caused his demise, since he was beheaded after refusing to sign the Act of Supremacy, which declared King Henry VIII of England the head of the Church of England.  Now, Machiavelli wrote the infamous political work of literature, "The Prince."  In the Prince, Machiavelli states various methods for a prince to successfully acquire the throne, secure his power, and stabilize the nation.  Although the work is fairly tedious and somewhat dense, you must know that in order for a prince or a leader to maintain his power, he must be feared, and not hated/loved.  Cervantes is the author of perhaps one of the best novels of all time, Don Quixote.  In this novel, Cervantes draws attention to a certain style of literature: prose fiction.  Don Quixote, has also been the inspiration for various works of art, opera, etc...it remains a great work today!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)<br>  <br>  p.s. Check out Francis the First of France, he was France's first monarch during the renaissance!|`|zbqDFhuGaa	The renaissance began in the city states of Italy in the mid 14th century, when lawyers - looking for guidance on legal matters - rediscovered writings from ancient Rome.  It is logical that the renaissance (rebirth) began in places like Florence because they never lost their latin literacy as did the rest of what once was the Roman Empire, and having divested themselves of royalty, they became republics and needed orderly protocols to seek justice.<br>  <br>  As to who had a profound effect on the renaissance?  Look back to Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) in the 14th century as the father of humanism.  In the 15th century, look to people such as Cosimo de Medici and Lorenzo de Medici as leading patrons of the arts; For the arts and architecture look to Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello, and Sandro Botticelli among others.<br>  <br>  For a primer on life in renaissance Florence go to <a href="http://www3.telus.net/Quattrocento_Florence/" rel="nofollow">http://www3.telus.net/Quattrocento_Flore...</a>|`|KADDz1EPaa	The greatest hero of the Renaissance was LEONARDO DA VINCI. <br>  Other builders were Machiavelli, Raffaello, Michelangelo, Guicciardini ...|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Divinci and Angelo started a new painting scene in the Renaissance. Plus Angelo contributed to the 16th chapel by painting the ceiling. <br>  <br>  The Medici?(Spell check on that) family was an extremely powerful family.

AA11101361	My understanding is that Tennyson's relationship with Hallam is usually considered to be platonic.  There are, of course, some scholars who think otherwise.  The reason Tennyson didn't marry until 40 was he couldn't afford to.,  He and Emily Sellwood were engaged for 10 years before he had the means to support her.  To me, that points to love on both sides, but even that doesn't mean he didn't love Hallam as more than a friend.<br>  It's odd that both Tennyson and his sister named their firstborn sons after Hallam.|`|tL73W0VZaa	Well, not that I have heard of, and I don't think that would count as "academic conjecture" unless people were debating what effect it might have had on his writing.

Voldemort would just go get the extra one, instead of the actual stone. It would have killed the plot, and not made any sense at all.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped (:|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Remember in the last book when it was revealed Dumbledore was using Harry? Dumbledore wanted Harry to get to it and face Voldemort, besides, even if it wasn't so, they had to return the stone to Nicolas Flamel sometime.|`|3cWnasQ2aa	probably so that Dumbledore could reach the stone if he needed to, he is also very trusting so he probably didnt think that one of the teachers involved in protecting the stone would try to steal it... besides the mirror should have stopped anyone from removing the stone with a purpose, if harry hadnt been there the stone wouldnt have been in danger of being taken|`|njppcqO8aa	Hi! those 2 points you don't care about are MINE! maybe because they decided that someone might be worthy of it someday to defeat Voldemort?|`|cvTzLEoBaa	I agree with the person above.|`|EdLeOUBfaa	The point of all of it was, that only a wizard or witch who knew about each of the areas of magic which kept the stone safe, and who only wanted to find the stone, but not use it, would be able to get it. <br>  <br>  Albus Dumbledore would obviously be this person. He would be able to get through all of the obstacles and he himself would not want to use the stone, he would retrieve it for Nicholas Flamel.|`|1jMwr6E0aa	In a magical world I doubt there are that many foolproof things. There's only a certain amount of precautions you can take to ensure that some things can't be magicked. For instance the fidelius charm, Anti-apparition jinxes, or imperturbale surfaces those kinds of things. They could have tried evanseco but I don't think they knew it yet. Plus I think that Dumbledore would perfer to not be a murderer and leave the person who attempted to steal it alive so they could find out if they were working alone or for someone else. Say Quirrell drank one of the poisons and died. Voldemort would not be thwarted. He'd try again. By keeping him alive they were able to see who the real culprit was. Also I'm sure he'd have wanted them to go to jail versus just dying.|`|knKVjOE6aa	Because Harry had get the stone because it had to be destroyed it should of never been made in the first place. Anyway it's wouldn't be called 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone' it would be called 'Harry Potter and the Impossible to get Sorcerers stone'|`|Q70iyG0yaa	probably because if they made it all posion nobody would be able to get through. what if the flamel guy decided he needed it? then dumbledore wouldn't be able to give it back.|`|VBL2Bnjqaa	Because thier wouldn't be enough tracking Harry down.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	If they made it completely impossible, then even the teachers wouldn't be able to get to the stone if it were needed.

Second, there was a part of him- and I didn't know how dominant that part was- that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.     -Bella Swan, Twilight, page 195<br>  <br>  I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect- not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.     -Bella Swan, New Moon, page 452<br>  <br>  In the end, dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn't want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn't have kept from me...   It was never going to end, was it?     -Bella Swan, Eclipse, page ???????  <br>  <br>  "Don't be afraid," I murmured. "We belong together." I was abruptly overwhelmed by the truth of my own words. This moment was so perfect, so right, there was no way to doubt it. His arms wrapped around me, holding me against him...   It felt like very nerve ending in my body was a live wire. "Forever," he agreed.     -Bella Cullen, Breaking Dawn, page 85<br>  <br>  "The lion fell in love with the lamb"<br>  <br>  Life sucks, and then you die.

It was a coffin lid that is in the British Museum now.<br>  A bit feeble, sorry. But true|`|6QEiuz7Naa	It affected the people's trust in machinery and technology. The 19th Century was the era industrial revolution. In the beginning of the 20th century, people were optimistic and eager to see the development of larger, even greater machines and advancements. The Titanic represented the greatness of man made machinery. It was luxurious and was a testament to wealth and design. People were extremely excited, it was known as the "unsinkable" liner. When it sank on its maiden voyage and over 1,500 people died, it was a shock to the world. If you read papers from this time, you will see the distress in the people. People became cynical and distrustful of the advancement of technology. It was one of the first times that "ode to machinery" advancement had killed so many people and failed miserably. A disillusionment set in. Their attitudes were affected greatly by this ship sinking and many began hindering their travel across sea. It also produced much critisim of the treatment of third class passangers and how their lives were disregarded over wealthier.

ciMSSNLmaa	"Book reviewers and theater critics are two separate things. I'm sure the best in each field, located in centers such as New York and London, earn decent salaries. However, the vast majority of book reviews are written by freelancers--professors, teachers, and writers with time on their hands. Even a national publication like People magazine pays only $75 to $125 for a book review. Local newspapers might pay $50 per review. Starting out, be prepared to do a lot of writing for free, just to build up a portfolio of work. The good news is that if you can write a good review, you can probably write lots of other things that will make you more money, including website content, feature articles, profiles, newsletters, and even books. Keep in mind that every newspaper article, magazine story, television program, radio show, website, commercial, song, book, and movie is written by someone. A talented writer will always find a way to make a living.<br>  <br>  As for "War and Peace." Yeah, that's advanced."<br>  <br>  thanks to Centaur

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	Are you a beginning photographer?  Try some basic photography first.  Wedding photography is not a genre for novice photographers.<br>  <br>  I am all for learning through books, but weddings are one thing that may be best learned as an apprentice to a working photographer.  (That is assuming that you have quite a bit of knowledge af photography in general, and understand both technical and artistic basics.)  That's not to say you can't get anything from a book, of course you can depending largely on your learning style and self-motivation.  One book for any photographer has to be "Understanding Exposure" by Bryan Peterson.  He also has books on portraiture and composition that are well done.  For weddings specifically,  "Portrait Photography Handbook", Monte Zucker,   "Existing Light for Wedding and Portrait Photography", Bill Hurter, and  Steve Sint's  "Wedding Photography:  Art, Business and Style".  "The Art of Wedding Photography" by Bambi Cantrell.  <br>  <br>  Again I stress weddings are not for new photographers.  It is harder than it seems, and the stakes are high for the parties involved.  Best wishes.

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Devil and Tom Walker" is a short story by Washington Irving that first appeared in his 1824 collection of stories titled Tales of a Traveller. It was part of the "Money-Diggers" portion. The story is very similar to that of the ancient German legend of Faust.<br>  <br>  Tom Walker is a miser who worships money more than he does his miserly wife. Tom Walker was a greedy and selfish man. This is until he takes a walk in the swamp at an old Indian fortress and starts up a conversation with the Devil incarnate (referred to as "Old Scratch" in the story.) Old Scratch strikes up a deal with Tom Walker: he offers the riches hidden in the swamp by Captain Kidd in exchange for Tom's employment under Old Scratch. Tom agrees to think about it, and returns home. Burdened with this secret, he mentions it to his greedy wife. When he is not there, Tom's wife takes all the valuables in the house and goes to make a deal with Old Scratch. When Tom goes in search of his wife, all he can find of her is her heart and liver in her apron tied to a tree. This conveyed two beliefs common among Irving's contemporaries: that the Devil finds you, rather than the other way around, and that women were held in contempt by the Devil. Tom Walker then agrees to the deal with Old Scratch (his wife was abusive towards him and he considered her death at the hand of Old Scratch a good thing). Tom agrees to become a loan shark. Tom constantly swindles people out of money, until he suddenly becomes fearful for the after-life. He then starts to become fiercely dedicated to God, always keeping a Bible at hand. When, one day, a person who had borrowed money from him and is asking for clemency blames Tom for taking his money, Tom says, "The Devil take me if I have made but a farthing!" At this time, there are three loud knocks at the door. Tom is drawn towards the black cloaked figure and realizes, in horror, that he has left his Bible at his desk. Tom Walker is then taken away by the Devil on the back of a black horse and is never seen again. All his assets vanished and his house burned to the ground. The ghost of the miser haunts the site of the old fort<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Devil_and_Tom_Walker" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Devil_and_To...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/wirving/bl-wirving-devil.htm" rel="nofollow">http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-e...</a>
w8gBWpKTaa	The guy above ALWAYS posts that answer...<br>  Do drama at school (GCSE/A-level) and get involved in community productions. As much as you possibly can! Even if your just playing a tree, experience is a must. After that, you can look into drama school or doing a Drama degree at Uni. Just make sure you take any opportunities that come your way :)|`|MHFuJGdGaa	No-one gets plucked out of schools.  No-one.  I don't understand where these rumors have come from, perhaps one in a million actors haven't received proper training.  Give me one flash in the pan Disney star, and I will give you ten properly trained actors who receive constant work and live in high regards.  <br>  <br>  Consider this:  If I were to be a surgeon, would you expect me to practice medicine straight out of high school?  No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines. Sense memory, Emotive memory, Place work, and moment-to-moment technique are all building blocks in a complex system developed by Stanislavsky modified by Strasberg, and near perfected by Meisner, which are MANDATORY to be a talented actor.  Marlon Brando did not wake up one day knowing how to act.   <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love." So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.|`|4yNhkOBzaa	You need to get an agent.

MHFuJGdGaa	How did you write an essay without writing a proper introduction?  When writing as essay, start with your Thesis statement (ex. As Shakespeare's tale of tragic ambition "Macbeth" progresses, Lady Macbeth undergoes a metamorphosis moving from (where she stands in your first paragraph) to (where she finally ends up).) from here, simply summarize the points which you will be making throughout your essay.<br>  <br>  I would recommend from this point forward you begin the essay writing process with an outline, it may seem unnecessary and useless, but I guarantee it will make your essay more cohesive and intelligent.

The principal result of the decision has been ongoing abortions, exceeding 35 million since the early 1970s.  I don't know the exact number, but it is huge.<br>  <br>  I think one of the results of Roe v Wade is that now we are in a debate over embryonic stem cell research.  Never would have happened without Roe v Wade.  As I see it, we have lost all understanding and respect for the human person.  That has all sorts of repercussions leading to proposals to legalize euthanasia, for example.  Basically, Roe v Wade legalized our right to treat human persons as objects.

6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	In 1748 the English government granted to the Ohio Company 200,000 acres of land near the headwaters of the Ohio River [generally in the vicinity of what is now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  In return, the company was to distribute the property among 100 families and build a fort to protect them and the British claim to the area. <br>  <br>  The activities of British explorers, trappers and traders in these western lands quickly became known to the French, who had been active in this area for more than a hundred years and had no interest in sharing the region with anyone, and especially not Englishmen (a term that then included people who lived in the thirteen British colonies along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to North Carolina, including Virginia).  They responded by constructing a string of forts in the contested area [now western Pennsylvania and Ohio] to assert sovreignty and to exclude Englishmen. <br>  <br>  The effort to control the Ohio Country was the most direct cause of the French and Indian War. <br>  <br>  The French, who had long claimed the Ohio Country as their territory, felt threatened by the Ohio Company's venture.  In 1753, 1,500 French soldiers entered the disputed area and began work to build and improve several forts, including Fort Le Boeuf (1753), Fort de Chartres (1754) and Fort Machault (1756) – these three forts all were located on and protected the vital main transportation and communications corridor for France, between Canada (Quebec) and Louisiana. <br>  <br>  Robert Dinwiddie, Virginia's lieutenant governor, upon hearing of France's actions, immediately sent George Washington and Christopher Gist to Fort Le Boeuf to persuade the French to leave.  The French commander refused and told the Englishmen that the French would arrest any English (that is, non-French European) settlers or merchants entering the Ohio Country. <br>  <br>  1747 May 3   O.S. <br>  1747 May 14   N.S.<br>  First Battle of Cape Finisterre<br>  Fourteen British ships of the line under Admiral George Anson attack a French thirty-ship convoy commanded by Admiral de la Jonquiere during the War of the Austrian Succession.  In a five-hour battle in the Bay of Biscay off Cape Finisterre in northwest Spain, the British capture four ships of the line, two frigates and seven merchantmen, seriously weakening the French Navy and thus contributing to the difficulties France has during the 1750s in supplying its colonies in North America. <br>  <br>  Neither the Anglo-American seizure of Fort Duquesne in 1758 nor the conquest of Quebec in 1759 proved decisive.  What finally determined the outcome of the war in America were two nearly simultaneous, reinforcing developments in 1759: the Battle of Quiberon Bay (November 20) and the Six Nations' decision to abandon the neutral stance it had maintained since 1755 and join the Anglo-Americans in the Niagara campaign.  The battle cost the French navy its ability to operate on the Atlantic, denying Levis the reinforcements and supplies he needed to capture Quebec and resist the invading Anglo-American armies.  The absence of trade goods and weapons simultaneously prevented him from rebuilding the Indian alliances that Montcalm had destroyed, so that the Iroquois alliance with the Anglo-Americans tipped the strategic balance irrevocably against the French...|`|Viec3YH9aa	Britian did not join the war for 2 years, it was a purely European War.  The Seven Year War was really a combintaion of a number of smaller region-specific wars.<br>  <br>  It was started when Prussian troops crossed the border of Saxony, an ally of of Austrian Habsburgs.  Most historians view the war as part of the continuing struggle between Prussia and Austria.  Under Fredrick the Great, Prussia had conquered the province of Silesia from the Austrians in 1740, during the First Silesian War, and was able to hold it throughout the 8 year Austrian War of Succession (1740-48).  During 1748-56 the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa had remodelled the Austrian Army, and formed new dipolmatic allainces across Europe in order to confront Prussia and regain Silesia.  These allainces left Prussia with only Hanover, and Great Britian as its sole allies, and Britian was a naval power.<br>  So Fredrick launched a preemptive attack, as was expecting one from Austria and her allies of Russia, France, as well as Sweden, Spain, Saxony, Naples and Sardinia.  this was called the Third Silesian War and whilst Prussia had basically all of Europe allied against succeeded in not only surving as a state, but also holding and confirming its hold on Siliesia.<br>  <br>  It is also argued that the rising tensions bewteen Britain and France, largley in their colonial possesions also helped lead to the war in and outside Europe.  The war between these 2 powers started with a France attack on the Briish held island of Minorca, off Spain.<br>  <br>  Will give you the rest later, but have a look at the Wiki page, looks pretty good at a quick glance<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years...</a>

I was wanting to publish a book too! Anyway, if you go to Yellowpages.com and enter book publishers and what state you want it published in, a whole bunch should come up!|`|YorMkZYAaa	Go buy or borrow The Writer's Market and start doing your research. You need to learn to do your homework before you can consider being published.|`|fI4LqMVMaa	"The Writer's Market" is the best resource I can suggest for an aspiring writer.<br>  <a href="http://www.writersmarket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersmarket.com/</a><br>  <br>  It can provide a lot of the resources that you will need and give you some guidance.<br>  <br>  Also, read Literary Marketplace (a thick book of literary agents). Look for those who specialize in your genre. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. Expect it to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. Thats just part of the business.<br>  <br>  You can also visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com/</a> to find an agent.<br>  <br>  In Order for your book to have a chance of publication:<br>  You’ll need to know how to write an effective ‘query letter’ to a literary agent. The letter will also include a synopsis of your book, preferably one that will hold the interest of the agent. The idea is to make him or her ask for the first couple of chapters of your work. Do not ever send a manuscript to a publisher or literary agent without sending your query letter first. <br>  <br>  You’ll also need to know how to format your manuscript. This includes the fonts (size and type) that most agents, editors, and publishers want. These are usually Courier New and Times New Roman (12 pt). Short stories and novels are formatted differently. You will need to follow submission guidelines just as they are laid down for your submissions. Anything less will result in your manuscript sent back or destroyed unread. <br>  <br>  One of the most important issues in manuscript submitting is the proper ‘page set up’ for your work. This includes margins, indents, and paragraphs. Most editors will want to see your manuscript double spaced. This allows the editor to use his/her proofreaders marks between the lines. Most margins will be one inch all around with a ragged right margin and an even left.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to hire an editor, remember: Your manuscript will be double spaced, which means there will be twice as many pages. A 600 page novel could cost you around $1800.00, some even more depending on what the editor charges per page. Then there’s the hourly rate that some charge. Usually it’s within the range of $65.00. So, if they work on your book for 18 hours, that’s another $1170.00 + $1800.00 = $2970.00<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a side note, it’s a good idea to know some of the publishing laws. The use of names and places. <br>  <br>  These include<br>  o Delivery Of Satisfactory Copy <br>  o Permission for Copyrighted Material <br>  o Grant Of Rights <br>  o Proofreading and Author's Corrections <br>  o Advances and Royalties <br>  o Author's Warranties and Indemnities <br>  o Copies to Author <br>  o Option Clause<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  ~Clarkie<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Additionally, you could self publish (this is called vanity press) but it is a more difficult and time consuming option.<br>  <br>  If you ARE looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically hold court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their book’s top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books.

It represents a period of ambiguity, of marginal and transitional state. Similarly does Arnold van Gennep, while describing rituals of transition. For Gennep, liminal or threshold world is a space between the world of status that the person is leaving and the world of status into which the person is being inducted. In post-colonial studies, for Edward Said, but especially for Homi Bhabha, the liminality is important as a category strongly related to the concept of cultural hybridity. For Bhabha, liminal as an interstitial passage between fixed identifications represents a possibility for a cultural hybridity that entertains difference without an assumed or imposed hierarchy. The concept of liminality as a quality of "in-between" space and/or state is of the outmost importance in describing some of the most interesting and highly specific social and cultural phenomena: the transcultural space, the transgeographical space, the transgender space etc. Sharon Zukin tranferred the term in urban studies, saying that liminal space is a growing caracter of contemporary city: she argues that the localism, or neghbourhood urbanism, of the modern city has been transformed into postmodern transitional space. This space is 'betwixt and between' economic institutions but is best described by the adjective liminal because it 'complicates the effort to construct identity' Liminal spaces are ambiguous and ambivalent, they slip between global market and local place, between public use and private value, between work and home, between commerce and culture. "<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats what she said.

m89kGXBnaa	Huckleberry Finn was one of the first books which demonstrated human feelings in the slave culture, Jim was hugely sympathetic. It was written directly against rascism. Jim is shown to be intelligent, caring and kind. White culture is often shown to be ignorant or uncaring (i.e. the Duke and the King fool people so often, society is cowardly or foolish, etc). There are as many examples of superstition in the white culture as the black, Mark Twain made it very clear we were equals<br>  <br>  Yes, Jim is a slave in the book and badly educated, but that would have been his position at the time. And Huck voices many of what would have been societies opinions, but this is in order to highlight what Mark Twain found so hypocritical about them. It's not racist.<br>  <br>  People have argued that it is, as it falls back on stereotypes of the time, often at Jim's expense. which is possible, definately, no book can fully rise above it's time and the culture it's written in. But it definately as a book works to challenge and mock the racist attitude of the times.|`|AA11898755	Of course it is racist. The question isn't "Is it"....it should be "WHY did Twain consciously express racism in HF?" after all, it is fairly well known that he intentionally did. So...why? what was he attempting to discuss in that subtext of intent?....therein lies your thesis<br>  (And, just for the record. Racism is NOT diminished by virtue of the "times" within which it is expressed. The fact that beating women was common as an expression of marital obligation in the context of "the times" does not mean it was any less wrong. So too with racism...the fact that it was commonly accepted does not mean it was less racist. Twain was strongly opposed to the injustice of racial inequality. He wrote  from a perspective "as if" prejudiced, as if racist, to make a stronger, broader point.  A book can be both racist by definition and pro-equality by effect of intent.  Don't let the load of the word get in the way.)|`|4F8b4D6Laa	It's not a racist book, it deals with racism, it's in fact anti-racism.|`|DrQ65EaAaa	Huck would have been considered an abolitionist at the time if he were an adult.

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	If you Google wedding photography you will find prices range from a few hundred up to tens of thousands.  Packages from burn a CD and hand it over, to many different print and album options.  The quality varies as much as the pricing.  I have seen very good work at the $500 level, and some rather poor offerings at over $2000.<br>  <br>  For your first wedding either charge what you are worth, or do it as a freebie or at cost for the portfolio material (hopefully) and the experience.  Don't forget the time spent post processing (assuming you're digital, if you shoot film factor in the cost of material and processing and pass that cost along, even if you do the shoot for free) <br>  <br>   Shooting a wedding is different from family or kid portraits, pets and landscapes.  Things move fast and there are no do-overs if something goes wrong with your end.  Every wedding photographer at some point shot their first one.  Some did a decent job, with others friendships have been lost and a lot of sadness and grief have happened when people have been disappointed.  Make sure you are prepared with skill and backup equipment.

Make sure the B&G understand that using a novice and inexperienced wedding photographer is unlikely to result in the kind of images that look like the ones in the magazines.

xopIi2Vfaa	Making a hole in a beer bottle isn't easy because beer bottles are not very well annealed and therefore break easily. <br>  there are some glass cutters which allow to make small circles more easily (pistol grip glass cutter for the tip rotates). They are about $40 thought. then you could use a candle (nothing hotter) to help to break the glass out. <br>  Otherwise an MAPP gas torch will melt glass. Though it will not keep it from breaking. Generally you will have better success if you don't just heat a small spot.<br>  If you are really carefull diamond bit drill bits might allow you to drill through glass. You will have to keep the area you drill wet.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	It is virtually impossible to melt a portion of a larger glass object without it shattering.  You could, in theory, heat the bottle in a kiln to about 1000F then take a fine pointed torch (oxy-propane, acetylene darkens glass) and working at that temp, melt a spot, but fun to handle things that hot.<br>    The only practical way is to drill holes and it is easier with a flat ended diamond bit rather than a pointed spade bit, water required for cooling.<br>  <a href="http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/coldwork.htm#DRILLING" rel="nofollow">http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/coldwo...</a>|`|AA11537248	Try an acetylene torch.

The holocaust was awful but learning about it is important. Its important to learn lessons from history and in doing so learn about - the propaganda, the belief in a new order both social and political, learning what it meant to be a nazi in terms of identity/party politics etc and also learn of the strength and endurance of human beings.<br>  <br>  Also, It can enable to victims to try and understand the abhorrent things which happened and why people did them. I am not justifying the holocaust, but it is necessary to learn from mistakes, even ones which should never have happened.|`|7cUDstdjaa	There have been some advances in medical science as a result, but nothing more' other than teaching the World that it can NEVER be allowed to happen again.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	The depths of human depravity are abhorent, but it is also essential to understand how evil, ordinary people can become if the social/economic and political conditions allow it.<br>  <br>  Evil in itself has no use, but the knowing the nature of goodness is impossible without knowing than nature of evil.
BHsswQpfaa	it's normal to be nervous.<br>  without being nervous, you wouldnt get the adrenaline rush, when going on stage...which actually helps you perform better.<br>  I think maybe you caring too much about what other people will think of you...<br>  When you're on stage....you are not you. you are your character. you are someone so different to you actually are, you can escape and explore. <br>  Don't think of everything so negatively...think, that maybe and most probably...everyone on stage, is in the same boat as you... AND alot of the people in the audience probably would never even have the guts to even try or attempt what you're doing.<br>  SO just have fun with it...<br>  remember you're someone else. you're not you on stage. just have fun with it :) goodluck x|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Deep breathes.<br>  And just get pumped and excited,and just imagine yourself doing good...And how you'll feel...And all the people telling you that you did a good job..And the adrenaline rush really helps when you preform.Just go out there,and do it!<br>  Tell yourself no need to be nervous,that you'll do great!<br>  <br>  Or picture the croud in their underwear...<br>  I hear that works...Lmbo.<br>  <br>  I'm a dancer,and when I preform...<br>  I just go out there,and do my thang!<br>  And it really helps that you can't see the croud because of the lights.|`|53c333d4e58da793c5bfbbb274584982aa	One technique is to imagine everyone in the audience naked. It sounds kind of odd but apparently it works. And just remember that going on stage is like going on a roller coaster. You get really nervous which you are in the que  and when you are going up the steep part slowly however once you get on the ride then you start to enjoy it and it is over really quickly. Just go out there and give it your best shot.<br>  Good Luck :D|`|SR5fz2dUaa	deeeeeeeeep breaths, and don't look in to the audience, look over their heads. plan everything through in ur head and keep telling urself how easy it will be and think of the worst case scenario, then laugh it off.|`|S7UWlOz7aa	You know the answer to that.|`|i45sJcPIaa	just be calm|`|gUCjkj9oaa	just think to yourself, well if I mess this up I can get another job and then go ahead.|`|BzMQejGxaa	I get that too. The shortness of breath and shakes are bad for me.<br>  <br>  What the point of the picturing the audience in their underwear/naked is not so you can have a laugh at what some man might be wearing under those awful trousers, but so that they do not seem so judgemental.<br>  <br>  When you see them in their clothes, you see them as the audience, judging you. If you pictured them in modest white underwear, they become less scary and you feel less vulnerable.
KGOVQIKAaa	I think one of the most important things about becoming a successful actor is resourcefulness. How do you make things happen when the odds are against you? If you can't pay for a class, how can you get what you want another way? How do you find out about auditions?<br>  <br>  The internet is a great tool - make it work for you. <br>  <br>  Finding open calls in your area shouldn't be too difficult. The companies holding the open call want actors to find out about them and attend the auditions. <br>  <br>  Start with a google search - look up the closest big city/town near you and type in "theatre" or "community theatre" or "film" or "student film" or any other combination you can think of.<br>  <br>  Most community theatres or even small professional theatre companies list their auditions on their websites. If they don't, oftentimes they will say how to submit yourself to their theatre.<br>  <br>  There are always independent and student films being shot in pretty much every town - many times they will post their audition notices on Craig's List. Always use caution when responding to any ad.<br>  <br>  Explore Talent is sometimes a tool I use. Now, before you jump on that website - please note that Explore Talent charges money for you to submit to any of the postings. DON'T do that. That's the scammy part of Explore Talent. However, you can use the information you find on Explore Talent to conduct a new google search. Sometimes they'll tell you the location of the project, the title, the company, and/or the characters - or some bit of useful information. If you do a google search for those things - 9 times out of 10 you can find out more about the audition and submit for it directly - for free!<br>  <br>  Remember, it should never cost you anything to audition. It should never cost you anything to submit for a project (unless you're mailing it in, then you pay for your own postage.) <br>  <br>  Many cities have actor networks or e-mailing lists that announce auditions as well as classes and theatre openings and readings, etc. By doing a google search, you may find one in your area.<br>  <br>  There are lots of options and lots of opportunities out there.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  (And no, you don't need an agent. It's a myth. You don't need one until you reach to a certain level. You can still be a professional actor without one. Most actors still hunt to find their own auditions. As an actor, you need to be in charge of your own career - an agent is not going to make your career for you. Be proactive.)|`|AKzHpC1Kaa	.

My opinion is that it's about sexual harmony between men and women :)|`|IRFLk4T1aa	I would think that the moral of this poem is if you (the dame) really love somebody and that person doesn't love you back, that person (Francis) shouldn't resort to physical punishment.

eBeMr9Pbaa	Firstly, she is a woman. Look at the times, women were regarded far inferior to men at that time, and would naturally be referred to as her husbands name.<br>  <br>  She is as nameless as the mouse which we see Lennie kill at the beginning.
