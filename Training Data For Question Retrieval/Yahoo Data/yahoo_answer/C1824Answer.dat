Remove it.<br>  <br>  To get rid of viruses, back up your personal files and reinstall Windows.<br>  <br>  To keep viruses off, use a limited user account, spend 5 minutes Googling for and reading up on "social engineering" and "phishing," set Windows updates to install automatically, and use Firefox with the NoScript extension.|`|lb0bYSgUaa	Right click the icon, in the task tray (down by the clock) it's the coloured square, possibly grey or with an exclamation mark over it if your definitions are out of date....select "Update Now".<br>  <br>  In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|mNzgWFkGaa	hello,   You can update to the latest free version of AVG or go for the free edition of AVIRA antivirus which by all accounts is very very good just google for it and download it.

These people do this all the time, it's free.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do that, at least download the free AVG, update it and run a complete scan (I would even scan in Safe Mode (to get there, at startup (black screen) start tapping the F8 key repeatedly til you get a menu where one of the choices is Safe Mode (choose that using the up or down arrow keys to get to it and then hit enter)<br>  <br>  Also, go to malwarebytes.org and download their free version, install it, update it and have it do a full scan (couldn't hurt to do that in Safe Mode as well (the scan).<br>  <br>  I also recommend downloading and scanning with Spybot Search and Destroy (you can get it at download.com or at majorgeeks.com).<br>  <br>  Install it, update it, and click to scan your PC with it  (and use the "immunize" feature in Spybot to protect yourself).<br>  <br>  I'd also download and install Spywareblaster (free from javacoolsoftware.com  (it acts much like the "immunize" feature in Spybot to basically block a lot of bad things from ever getting a foothold on your PC.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you have automatic Windows Updates turned on and that it's working, make sure you're behind a good router (as a firewall). <br>  <br>  I also recommend downloading and using Firefox (instead of Internet Explorer), and using NoScript.<br>  <br>  If your present infection is bad enough, tho', it might just be easiest to back up (on CD or DVD or a jump drive) all the files on your PC you care about, and then find the Windows install disk and just reformat the hard drive and do a new clean install.  This, by the way, is the only way to be 1000% sure your PC is clean.  You can be reasonably sure the other ways, (scanning with the above tools, etc), but the only way to be absolutely sure is to start fresh with a clean install (reformat the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, then immediately go to update.microsoft.com and get all the windows updates, and make sure you have all of the above in place (that you're behind a router with good encryption turned on (WPA, NOT WEP (wep is weak and easily hacked), have a good constantly updated antivirus, a good anti spyware, etc). .<br>  <br>  also download a free program called Sandboxie from sandboxie.com<br>  <br>  It's a sandbox and if you open your browser in the sandbox, then nothing you encounter from the internet can make any permanent changes to your PC ( unless you click to "recover" them). . <br>  that includes viruses, they can't make any permanent changes to your PC, so when they THINK they are infecting you, sandbox just lets them think they have, and when you later click to "delete sandbox", all the changes the viruses thought they made to your computer are now gone.<br>  so it's a very safe way to browse.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	Get rid of AVG.  I has caused quite a few problems with my users that I work with.  Trend Micro is a great Anti-Virus software.  Sorry it is not free but at least you will be protected from 99.9% of those nasties.  Also oops!!! you are sooooo wrong MAC's are just as susceptible to get a virus as a PC what you have heard is false propaganda.  Actually studies have shown that SPAM and MALWARE writers are now focusing in on MACs because they have a greater than 5% of the computing market.  You would be very wise as well to obtain antivirus software for you MAC as well.  Dont get caught with your pants down around your ankels it hurts.
YvtFiWT5aa	Pretty similar other than that, different heatsinks, P6T Deluxe has 2 more USBs and Firewire. The WS's are usually geared more towards reliability and up-time whereas the others are geared towards performance and overclocking. The Deluxe V2 just drops the SAS support, and is $10 cheaper.<br>  <br>  Really though the P6T vanilla is the best value. Has proper TRI-SLI (the deluxe doesn't have the correct layout for dual-slot coolers cards) as well as mounting holes for both 1366 AND s775 cpu coolers, which gives you a lot wider cooling selection. I have the P6T deluxe, but if i was buying now I'd get the regular P6T.

This take you to the second column an there you are going to write your text.  <br>  <br>  Edit your answer if you have another version, and I will help you.<br>  Rate this answer please.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Using the column feature is one way but a bit convoluted (and you have to put in the correct type of breaks before and after).<br>  <br>  You can put the plain text in one of the columns in the table (you can merge the column so it's one long column), take off the line borders around the text so it just looks like it's not in the table (but it really is).

You want more, then make more folders.<br>  <br>  2. go back to folder1 and open it so the song selections are displayed on the window. click the "view" button so that the songs are displayed in a table manner showing the title, artist, album, Track #, Genre, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  3. on the bottom part of the window is your editing portion where you can change or rename the song (if you want to).

dkpIjt5jaa	On consumer-level notebooks, there is no video card but rather a graphics "chip" in your system's Discrete Logic ( a subsystem hardwired* or etched* on the motherboard ).<br>  <br>  One way you can ensure the best total (graphics, video and otherwise) performance of your PC is to install the MAXIMUM amount of RAM that it can take.<br>  <br>  <br>  The rule on that is determined by two limits:<br>  <br>  1) Your OS (32-bit (XP or Vista) will have a limit of 4 GBs (about 3.5 for Windows and 0.5 for the hardware subsystem) and 64-bit (XP or Vista depending on version) can go from 8 to 128 GBs)<br>  <br>  2) Your PC slots number and physical RAM acceptance (varies by manufacturer and model line)<br>  <br>  <br>  * Hardwired means soldered to the motherboard<br>  * Etched means burned on the motherboard ( those gold circuits lines )<br>  <br>  <br>  The easiest way to get that information is to visit the support site of the PC manufacturer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry about that but NVIDIA or ATI cards go in desktops and towers

Just double click on the desktop install icon and  It will create the proper linux partitions on your HDD and even preserve your window$ install to setup as a dual boot environment.  After installation when you start your computer it will have a screen where you pick whether you want to run Win or Linux.  You can run nearly everything right from the CD before you commit to installation just to verify that it will work well with your hardware.

It could just be that your hardware it is not going to like it. I know that does not sound scientific, but that is a lot of gigs for your computer to recognize all at once. You may need to partition it, and of course you will have to format it. But for any of this, if you purchased the disk it would have certainly came with a manufacturers disk that will boot, examine your system and tell you if you have any issues, and then you can install your new hard drive. It should be rather painless. If you did not get such a disk because you bought it OEM or whatever, go to the website of whatever maufacturer, like seagate maxtor or whatever and get the install software before attempting it old school.

Once you discover how it works, you’ll surely use it often, speeding your work and boosting your efficiency. Be aware that it does more than its name implies: It’s a tool that, with a couple of keystrokes, can generate customized technical names, frequently used phrases, titles, paragraphs and a multitude of special symbols. The tool is included in most Office applications (Excel, Word, Outlook, Access, OneNote, Project, Publisher and Visio). So anything you add, delete or change in AutoCorrect will also be active when you’re in any of those other applications.<br>  <br>  Let’s get back to solving your problem. In Excel 2003, access AutoCorrect by clicking on Tools, AutoCorrect Options. Under the Replace text as you type heading, cursor down to (c). When you click on it, it instantly moves under Replace, bringing ? along with it.<br>  <br>  You can simply delete the shortcut by clicking on Delete, but I would suggest you not eliminate it because you may want it in the future. Instead, consider giving it different shortcut keys. For example, you could keep the c but replace the parentheses with open and closed brackets and click on OK.<br>  <br>  In Word 2007, access AutoCorrect by clicking on the Office button and then on Word Options (at the bottom of the screen that opens). If you’re in Excel, the message will be Excel Options. Then click on Proofing, AutoCorrect Options and follow the same steps as above.<br>  <br>  The AutoCorrect tools are easily modified. Think of all the long, complex words or phrases or even sentences you frequently type; now, with a few shortcut keys, AutoCorrect can do the job for you.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|5XWlsEjcaa	Undo it as soon as it turns into (c) symbol (copyright).<br>  <br>  For example, try this<br>  - Type (c) and press Spacebar<br>  - you'll see it turn into a symbol<br>  - Just click Ctrl+Z to undo that

XlyLakYAaa	Well, there are a couple of things you can do to be ultra-careful about your computer.  Naturally, the surge protector will cope with some spikes (which are far more dangerous than brown-outs), but if you want *real* protection for the computer, you should get an Uninteruptable Power Supply (UPS for short).  These are also known as battery backups.  They provide far more protection for your PC than any surge protector and even protect against brown outs and power failures.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is replace the power supply in your computer with a high-end one.  Crappy power supplies can fry with power surges and they have no internal protection to prevent the surge from taking out the rest of your computer in the process.  A good power supply will have an internal breaker and other hardware to prevent a catastrophic power failure from damaging the rest of your PC.|`|YvtFiWT5aa	It's impossible to say how large the spike was, but I will say that if your equipment is still working fine you're in the clear, if it had damaged anything it would be dead. Be sure to replace the surge protector though, as they're only really good for one major spike. <br>  <br>  As long as you have a quality unit rated at 1500 joules or more you should be ok.
AA10096832	Isn't that like $75?<br>  Oh dear.<br>  I charge $55 per hour.<br>  The more experienced designers I know charge $70 per hour and can easily go into the thousands of dollars because it takes a while to go back and forth with a client trying to decide on the design. Then of course you need to actually code the HTML/CSS (or whatever you're coding in.)<br>  <br>  Hmm. Rates must be different where you are. But it does seem like you'd really be working for peanuts at that rate.|`|yO5tm6e1aa	Only dummies would charge and/or build websites based on a dollar/pound rating per page.  Rather, a websites design should be based improving the business it's set up for.  Websites can be used to advertise the business, but it's much better if it also manages a process for a business.  For example, you might have an operator you hired for a business which routes calls, takes reservations, and takes product orders.  This position must be paid for, and is prone to errors if the person takes the information down incorrectly.  A website can take the information directly from the consumer, without a phone call.  And, by taking the information first hand, it will not "hear" the consumer incorrectly allowing for higher accuracy.  It cuts the cost to the business because it frees the employee to do more productive work (or get cut).  When a web application solves creates a business solution, it has a value.  The initial charge should represent the scope of work that must be put into understanding the business, designing a solution, building the solution, and delivering the solution.  For a small business, this is typically $3,000 to $10,000 USD.  For large business, this is typically $500,000 to well over 2 million.  But, these are just the initial charges.  Recurring charges for maintaining the site is where the money is made.  For small business, this is generally between $100 and $500 USD monthly.  It includes services such as hosting, backups, small site updates, web statistics, content management, reporting, and billing.

I would say that it doesn't do any damage, but it will definitely shorten the lifespan of your laptop.

The heating and cooling of the parts causes them to expand and contract, reducing their life span more so than just leaving it on.<br>  <br>  Since you know you want to keep AIM up, set your power settings to automatically turn off your screen and to turn off the hard disk after a specific amount of time.<br>  <br>  The only other consideration is heat build up.

7aHsYbcfaa	Are you using wired or wireless?<br>  <br>  For best results, you should use wired if possible -- it's far simpler and more reliable.<br>  <br>  If you're using wireless, and can't use a wired connection, make sure your wireless is set up with the best configuration possible.  Put your wireless router as high up as you can and as far from electrical and metal things as you can, that'll give you the best coverage.  Try to put it in the middle of where you expect to be (usually the middle of the house).  If you have 2.4GHz cordless phones you may want to replace them with 5.8GHz, 900MHz, or the new DECT6.0 phones that won't cause interference.  Also, wireless video senders, or wireless cameras that run on 2.4GHz should be set to the farthest channel from your router (e.g. set video sender to 1 or A and put the router on channel 11).  Channels 1, 6, and 11 are preferable because they don't "overlap" with each other.
vDGFRACaaa	Well, unless you know anything about HTML, XHTML, CSS, ASP or ASP.NET, PHP, and the secure coding of an Ecommerce website, you should probably look for an expert. A Web Developer can do the coding and a Web Designer/Graphic Designer can do the pretty parts.<br>  <br>  Most likely you will need to take people's credit card numbers for their order. If this information is not secure, any pirate can take it and the customer will blame you and your site's lack of security. (This is another reason to hire an expert instead of trying to build it yourself.)<br>  <br>  If you're on a budget, go to rentacoder.com.

KG3MptIdaa	It's all for people who live boring, mundane lives on the internet... Go figure that myspace posts it since most of the world spends it's free time there lurking pages of people they will never meet or pretending they themselves are oh so cool and famous. That photo should have never been leaked and I hope they find out who gave it to TMZ and they are fired.  <br>  <br>  The only reason that the paparazzi invades all these celebrities lives is because 80% if not more of America seems to not have enough drama in their everyday lives, so they need to live vicariously through other people they will never know or meet. It's sad, actually it is pathetic. But so long as the public keeps clicking away on it, grabbing their People Magazine and watching TMZ's horrid television show it will just continue.<br>  <br>  I wish someone would invade the lives of the people who do this crap... Have pictures of them in the bathroom, committing adultery on their lunch break, camera two inches away from their face when ever they leave home, blocking their car so they can't drive - I doubt they would enjoy it. The golden rule of "do unto others" doesn't mean a damn thing so long as a nice fat check is at the end of ruining someones life.<br>  <br>  And back to the Rhianna/Chris Brown deal... I don't care. No one should care. The public doesn't know them personally - Rhianna is not their bff and asking them to defend her in court. Chris Brown isn't going to knock on your door asking if you'll be his new gf. It is completely stupid and if it were ANYONE ELSE who was not famous, nobody would care. Here's a news flash: domestic violence happens everyday! Oh my god, Suzie trailer trash and the desperate housewife down the street aren't plastered on Myspace. Rihanna shouldn't be either, nor Chris. It's their personal issue, it should not have happened, end of story. Now they have to go back to being adults and dealing with the consequence of their actions. Stop caring about them, they don't care about you. They just want you to buy a CD and stop ripping it off of Limewire.|`|Ud7gdzFBaa	I think it's really tacky for TMZ to post that photo in the first place, and for myspace to follow suit is just as tacky. Obviously they don't care about Rhianna's privacy, or the fact her case is pending investigations. If I were her lawyer I'd be suing the crap out of both of them!|`|uyfTeiyraa	I'd be pissed, but I mean hey, that's Hollywood. Rihanna never does any crap like Lindsay Lohan, so they never get to have her all over the tabloids except for getting nominated for a Grammy (wow, a star with actual talent? Amazing!).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's good that they're raising awareness for relationship abuse. It's a serious problem. Chris Brown should probably suck my d*ck.|`|eoFyvtYcaa	The person that took that picture, probably got paid a ton of money for that picture. I mean, when paparazzi unleash a baby photo of a celebrity, boom they have money. A lot of people get on myspace daily, so them showing it on the myspace home page, it will show the damage that Chris Brown did to her and a lot of people will see that Chris Brown is really not a true idol. <br>  <br>  But consider this, the police reports do not have verification that it is indeed Rhianna that go beat up. Its an unidentified person. So Rhianna might not be the victim of the matter.|`|K7fvYyu2aa	Personally i feel some people are defending Chris Brown because he's a celebrity. If this was your average Joe down the street this guy would be getting some jail time. <br>  <br>  Chris brown is and should not be above the law just because he's a celebrity.<br>  Even if a girl slapped you why would you beat her up so she looks like that? <br>  <br>  But be that as it may, we do not know the whole situation.<br>  And i'm very sad at some of the commenting over there that say that she deserved getting beaten up. Personally i believe that in today's society more and more people are forgetting about being a gentleman and taking the high road. But then again that's just my opinion.|`|9gOHTGB2aa	i think is not right to just pst a picture of her after Chris Brown beat her up. It's privacy and i dont think she would wwant fans to see that picture.<br>  And its horrible what he did to her. <br>  <br>  BTW.Now i dont like any of them anymore cause him and rhianna both have problems.|`|Mfn4Hlc5aa	no. its not right, but i STILL LOVE CHRIS BROWN!!!!!!!!!|`|xbqqaYIQaa	i think that they are showing the pictures of rhianna on myspace homepage because they are most likely getting thousands of dollars for it.i would never want my privacy to be invaded like that. im not on Rhianna's side either though.if she made him mad enough to hurt her that much then she most likely deserved some of it.i am not saying it was right i just don't think that chris brown should be charged with attempted murder.|`|6QGvNuTVaa	sftbalfanatic44's  HOW CAN YOU EVEN SAY SOMETHING AS DISGRACEFUL AS "SHE PROBABLY DESERVED IT" You are basically saying domestic violence is ok if the victim did something wrong, when really- NOTHING can excuse domestic violence.

It's pretty bad that TMZ released the picture, the sooner TMZ is shutdown the better.|`|qYojRnsnaa	Here's another photo of her, trying to find more without the logo<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fcopyrights.com/forum/pics/43-tmz-rihanna-beat-up-assaulted-face-photo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fcopyrights.com/forum/pics/43...</a>|`|V8ErN4Vqaa	i would feel so distant, like no one understood me. paparazzi make celebrities look bad for money and if your going to be a celebrity then you should expect to look bad a couple times in the press.<br>  <br>  and rihanna and chris brown are great, in my opinion.|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	i think it's really wrong.<br>  she looks horrible, and i think that it should have been kept private.

The registry is just like a database. If an entry is missing or not correct, Windows will just ignore and skip over it as if there was nothing.

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Computer files are stored in the first available space on your hard drive, and this often involves breaking the files up into several separate pieces.  When accessing the files, the computer has to search the drive until all the pieces are found, and it is this that slows down its operation.  The Windows Defragment utility is found in Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools.  I use a better program (freeware), Smart Defrag, from IoBit.com.  It has a "super" optimizer option, which seems to make a genuine difference in computer speed for me.<br>  <br>  The other things you should do are to clean up "junk" files at least once a week, and to disable unnecessary programs running in the background.  To do the former, download CCleaner from CCleaner.com (freeware) and run it at least once a week.  It also has a registry cleanup function, which should be done once a month.  To do the latter, you might want to get a computer-savvy friend to show you what to do.  It involves running the Microsoft Configuration tool (in Start - Run - (type msconfig in the box and hit Enter).  That program lists all the things running in the background, which use up computer resources.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Defragmenting does do a lot of good, but it is not a magic bullet. It rearranges files on the disk closer to the outside so the computer can access them faster, as the outside of a round disk spins faster than the inside, and data rate is higher.<br>  <br>  Defragmenting should be done more like once a week, lol. It helps the computer run smooth.<br>  <br>  It is a re-arranging of files for better performance. It doesnt clean anything. You should do that before you defragment.<br>  <br>  And not through Windows, either. Windows Disk Cleaner leaves a LOT behind. Get Webroot - Window Washer, it will clean out stuff you never knew you had.|`|0ekatLgUaa	Fragmentation is when computer write files to the disc the don't always write the file in order.

tOCESHLYaa	AVG free may be on the weak side. It is missing some features. The paid AVG Internet Security should give you good protection. Are you fully protected, not likely. But if you have good internet habits and don't do dumb things while online you probably are fine. If you use P2P file sharing then you could have problems. I do like the answer you got about layered protection. As if adding more programs will give you more protection.It will give you more detection but does not give you more protection. If you really want to be fully protected you should learn about prevention, Not allowing your computer to get infected is the way to go. Kaspersky is a good program, and you may like it. Wait in till your time is up on your AVG subscription then you can get the free trial of Kasperky Internet Security.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	AVG anti-virus seems to be improving but historically it's been one of the weakest.

It also has provides very good protection against viruses, spyware, trojans, etc. I'd go for that rather than AVG.<br>  <br>  A layered approach to security still has merit and the free versions of MBAM / SAS are worthwhile as they don't run in real-time, so consume no resources, but are useful as a double-check for spyware. <br>  <br>  Also, I'd suggest Firefox with NoScript or IE8 (when released) as these provide protection against XSS attacks, which conventional security programs don't.|`|4g8ckvjBaa	no antivirus is 100% foolproof.you need to have a layered defense,such as antivirus and antimalware.two good ones are malwarebytes,and superantispyware.avg is alright.|`|ULbkPIGdaa	As long as you are not running random files from obscure websites or clicking email attachments from people you don't know, then AVG is perfectly fine.

7aHsYbcfaa	If your printer has an ethernet port on it, it already has a printer server built in.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is find it's hostname or IP address and set up TCP/IP printing ports on each computer you want to print from.  Then, install the printer drivers on each computer.  On HP laser printers, I know you can make it print it's IP and hostname address -- go to Menu > Information > Print Status (sometimes called Test Print) and it will print 1-2 pages with all the settings.<br>  <br>  I recommend setting a static IP address on the printer -- you'll have to refer to the manual for directions.  Then, use that IP address to print to.<br>  <br>  On Windows XP and Vista, you can change the port by going to printers in control panel, right-click your printer (it has to be installed first) and go to properties.  Then, on the "Ports" tab, click add and make a new TCP/IP RAW port with the IP address or hostname of your printer (you must use the IP if you set a static IP address, and that's what I recommend).  Then, make sure that's the only port that's "checked".  For best results, CLEAR the checkboxes for bidirectional-support and printer pooling unless you really know what you're doing.|`|BJxZ9DLOaa	The computers is set to connect and print to the network printer?  yes.<br>  <br>  Is it set to print as a local printer or a network printer?<br>  <br>  The other machines an the network, are they set to print to the network printer?<br>  <br>  Do you have other machines on the network?<br>  <br>  <br>  Even with the main computer off the network printer has to be driven by a printer driver.<br>  <br>  Network printers respond and print from a network printer driver.<br>  <br>  Do you have the printer plugged into the USB port?|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	For most printers you need what is called a printer server in between the router and the printer.

If you have two identical systems on that is 32bit and one that is 64bit, neither will be faster then the other unless the systems have resources that exceed the limit for a 32bit system.<br>  <br>  All future operating systems will be 64-bit.  Already some operating systems have gone completely over to 64-bit (Windows 7, Solaris 10, and Mac OS X).  In about 5 years all computers will be 64-bit.|`|laofAjTAaa	yes 64 bit is much better alround|`|AsqUEG1Gaa	64-bit better because it supports more ram and faster at pulling up files and processing  them|`|ETmuhR0raa	64 bit is good if you're going to have over 4 GB of RAM, which is completely unnecessary for gaming and office work, unless it's Autocad. 32 Bit Vista can handle 4 GB of ram, and less. 64 bit handles up to 16 GB of RAM.<br>  <br>  32 bit XP handles 3,2 GB ram. and 64 bit XP handles up to 8 GB.<br>  <br>  It's really a question of quality parts, if your parts have 64 bit drivers, certified - then yes, they will work. To gain an extra boost, however, you must try to find 64 bit versions of all programs you are going to use. All programs from Microsoft comes with 64 bit compatibility, Office, DirectX and Games for Windows.<br>  <br>  No Computer needs more then 4 GB of RAM to work for, for my part I'd chose 32 bit cause of the simplicity to use, and because it is all I need.|`|tlEMsiHwaa	if your going to alot of gaming go for the 64 bit better resolutions and ability for more ram which is 8Gb

zorYTX59aa	Believe it or not, the YouTubers who put up<br>  those videos and the people who wrote the<br>  text comments to them did nothing special. <br>  <br>  It is a relatively new feature about YouTube. <br>  If you refer to a particular timeframe in your <br>  comment (e.g. 2:47), it automatically turns <br>  it into a blue "time link". If you click on that <br>  link, it takes you right away to that specific<br>  part of the video.  <br>  <br>  However for this to really happen, you have<br>  to write the time with "space bars" on both <br>  sides.

ESY1pBnPaa	You need to burn the .iso file to a CD-R.  An .iso file is an image file.  After you've burned the CD, you'll need to put it in the CD Drive, and reboot your computer.

Get some tea or red bull and DO NOT TOUCH YOUR COMPUTER UNTIL IT FINISHES BURNING (sorry I shouted).  Then if you want to boot it up, just reboot with the CD in the drive.  I would say play with it.  Don't install it until you feel ready to.  You can run it as a live cd though it is sluggish.  If you are planning to dual boot, go type on search engines the words "dual boot ubuntu windows".  Read at least THREE tutorials before repartitioning your drive.<br>  <br>  Otherwise just click on install and the program will walk you through installing it, BUT you are most likely voiding any warranty on your computer.

7aHsYbcfaa	Sounds like interference to me.<br>  <br>  Put your wireless router as high up as you can and as far from electrical and metal things as you can, that'll give you the best coverage.  Try to put it in the middle of where you expect to be (usually the middle of the house).  If you have 2.4GHz cordless phones you may want to replace them with 5.8GHz, 900MHz, or the new DECT6.0 phones that won't cause interference.  Also, wireless video senders, or wireless cameras that run on 2.4GHz should be set to the farthest channel from your router (e.g. set video sender to 1 or A and put the router on channel 11).  Channels 1, 6, and 11 are preferable because they don't "overlap" with each other.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Bad antenna in the device. Unfortunately the sleek enclosed case makes this a replacement job.

ebuxHnScaa	One is for data and power, the other is just for extra power. It's usually not needed with desktops or with USB hubs that have their own power supply. But some laptops don't provide enough power on each USB port, and the drive will need them both connected.<br>  <br>  If the drive isn't getting enough power from the USB port, it will not work at all. So if it's working with just one connector, then everything is fine. The USB port can supply enough power.<br>  <br>  But if you connect just the single data & power connector on a laptop, you may find that the drive doesn't work because the laptop can't supply enough power. The same thing can happen if you use an unpowered USB hub (since all the devices on the unpowered hub have to share the power from the single USB port the hub is plugged into).|`|0KgrjTgtaa	I have no idea why this is, but mine has two as well.<br>  Mine only works on my PC when I plug both in, but on my laptop it will work if I plug either in.<br>  It sounds like yours has one for just power (no idea why it would need that though), and one so that you can access the stuff saved on it as well as powering it.|`|wKfJ8pRpaa	You can actually check the power usage on USB devices using the Device Manager, so you can see it your drive is using/needing a lot of power.<br>  <br>  Tony|`|sI8nXHGgaa	simple... so when  u use it.. it sends info 2 ur compiter 2x quicker.. but i think it should work with one wire :S

LyN5mYs1aa	Transparent PNG's are images that have transparent backgrounds. So they look nice on backgrounds of different colors.<br>  <br>  For example, if you had a forum signature and the default of the site was white, you would normally have a white background. But if there was an option for a black based site, it might look wierd. So that's why you would save it in PNG. Because JPEG or GIF doesn't support transparency.<br>  <br>  Example of a PNG: <a href="http://i207.photobucket.com/albums/bb188/FreedomWingz/MTS-1.png" rel="nofollow">http://i207.photobucket.com/albums/bb188...</a><br>  You can't tell the difference unless you use it as a sig or something of that sort on a background that's not white.<br>  <br>  Well it depends on your program that you use, Paint, does not support GIF. All images are saved to JPEG by default. Photoshop or GIMP DO support PNG. Just when you go to Save to Web, select PNG-8 or PNG-24 (If I'm not mistaken).

Simply drag and drop files and/or directories onto the blank CD icon on your disc drive under My Computer. When you've placed all the files you want to, press Write Files to Disc on the left task pane.<br>  <br>  If you want to burn something other than a data CD, such as a music CD or video CD (VCD or SVCD), then you'll need third party programs, such as Nero.<br>  <br>  Likewise, if you want to burn a CD image, you will need third party software. For this, I recommend the free IMGBurn.<br>  <br>  Please note that in the future, when asking questions about how to do something, it is helpful to the people attempting to answer the question if you specify what it is that you are trying to do.

sNxMPa4Kaa	Of course you can use a WYSIWYG editor, but in the long run it is not the way to do it. What if you have quite a few pages and you need to edit the styles and template of the pages? If you use a WYSIWYG editor you have to do this manually, page by page. It is not good and generally it generates its own code - which is spaghetti code - bad code. <br>  <br>  Forget all of those answers that say just do what is easier and use freewebs. That is not the proper way to do it and in the long run it is not the easier way. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is to learn how to code by hand. Learn HTML, XHTML and CSS. That should get you on your way. In a few months you should be able to do this. <br>  <br>  The benefits of learning how to code by hand (its not hard) are that it is easier to edit, better for cross-browser design, better for menu design, better for accessibility, better for your search engine rankings, and you control everything that happens. <br>  <br>  You can edit the code in a program like Notepad (for windows) and then preview it in your web browser. Or better still, get a program like Dreamweaver or Expressions Web and use the codeing part, and then preview in the web browser. Don't use the design section, it's not that accurate.<br>  <br>  For more information and free tutorials, go to:<br>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com</a><br>  <br>  Once you've made your site, find a good webhost and upload your site. You can get free ones or cheap ones from $30 per year!<br>  <br>  If you need more help, I'm a member (diddy) of a web design and web development forum community that is committed to helping people like you:<br>  <a href="http://www.webdesignforums.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.webdesignforums.net</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  <br>  BTW I should know, I'm a web developer in training.|`|6re0PCs4aa	This depends on how much HTML you know.

v1tHjJ3haa	LOL, but really annoying. I don't care for him, but is that like his real voice ? :P|`|1EN9ngsbaa	Fred is a touchy subject for almost all you tubers, but here's my take on the energetic six year old:<br>  <br>  I think that fred can be funny. I really do. Some of the jokes that he puts in can make me smile, and I might have laughed once or twice as well. But Fred's humor doesn't appeal to all<br>  <br>  I can understand why some people hate fred. I think that some of it was jealousy. After only about 7 months, fred grew to be #1 most subscribed on youtube. You might think that fred joined to years ago, but if you watch this video, that will be explained: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-CehxoJy..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-CehxoJy...</a><br>  <br>  Another reason is the way he acts. The high pitched, childish antics annoy some people. And the fact that hes number one doesn't help much either.<br>  <br>  I think most of Fred's subscribers are under aged, and his comedy appeals mostly to them. You see a lot of people hating on fred, but I'm willing to bet that 80% of them are over the age of 18.|`|VvKJUCYgaa	He's alright.<br>  I watched the iCarly episode with him online, it was pretty good ^_^<br>  If you enjoy Fred, you should check out thepumpernickles<br>  <br>  <br>  HAPPY YOUTUBING!|`|PVb3iiaAaa	hahaha... idk bout u but i think he is really funny!!! hahahaha he is like one of the funniest dudes on youtube!!!|`|QDu1v1KSaa	stupid, childish humor|`|GHkpKIamaa	He is the WORST. What he does takes no talent, and only makes... what, a 9 year old laugh? Everybody above that age who enjoys him is probably immature. Also, he doesn't even make good jokes. Half his jokes he probably got out of an old joke book.|`|O0xv8902aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Hmm... hes a Funny guy with a Squirrel voice :D I love it when he screams and does stupid stuffs. :P|`|2qB22vXDaa	I LOVE fred! he's sooooo funny! his voice dosnt get annoying at all to me. his latest video is my favorite. fred rescues the neighbor hood squirrels.|`|9X1wOSZKaa	he is kind of getting annoying,i think he was good in the beginning but know i don't like|`|oGe4X9jsaa	omgg... lolz i LOVE Fred!!! lolz he is funny... i miss jkl productions.... :( they were funny... lolz but lucas(FRED) had to move... :(|`|TQgR2Dr6aa	Hes a annoying Gay Whore!!!!!!

syC3uQpjaa	Open up the start menu and click 'Control Panel' <br>  Double click on 'Programs and Features' <br>  Look at the list. Chances are there's a lot of things you'd forgotten on there. <br>  Select a program you don't need any longer by clicking on it. <br>  Click on the button at the top that says 'Uninstall'. (Note, sometimes it says 'Uninstall/Repair, click on that one if plain old 'uninstall' is unavailable). <br>  Follow what the computer tells you. Depending on the program a different menu will come up, but common sense usually tells you what to do. <br>  Delete every single file that you don't need. <br>  Double check the list to make sure you haven't missed anything that takes up a lot of memory but you never actually use. <br>  Open all the programs like Word Processor, Powerpoint, Paint etc, and check all the saved files there, deleting any you don't need by right clicking on the file name and pressing delete. <br>  Right-click on the recycling bin icon on your desktop and press 'Empty Recycling Bin'. The pop-up that says 'Do you want to permanently delete these ___ files?' can often be a ridiculously large number. <br>  Install a good anti-virus program. The best free one is AVG, but you can pay for the best spyware. <br>  Restart your computer/laptop. Often to notice a change the computer needs to start up again. <br>  after you do all of that go to <start>,<all programs>,<accesories>,<system tools>, and click <disk defragmenter>.choose the drive you want to defrag.usually its the C. drive. first it analyzes and then defrags.you should notice a huge differince in how fast programs run. <br>  If you use a Windows operating system, Windows saves a file of the program you are using to make it start up faster. After years of using your computer this folder, Prefetch folder, gets filled with unused programs. This command prompt will delete this folder for you and get rid of idle processes. Simply open a notepad file, copy and paste this into line 1 without the quotes "del C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.* /Q" hit enter and on line 2 paste "Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks". Then go to save as, name it whatever you want, I chose a simple name as 'faster'. Make sure after the name it does not have faster.txt, you need to put faster.bat (The .bat extension will run it as a batch file. Once it's saved you can go ahead and run it! In a few moments the command prompt will dissappear and your programs should run more smoothly. <br>  Repeat this every month or so, depending on how much you download files/create documents/powerpoints or whatever.
7aHsYbcfaa	If FiOS is in your area, that's probably it.  Verizon's firmware uses random 5-character names like that and WEP64 (not good but better than nothing) for the default security.<br>  <br>  Same reason you see Linksys, Netgear, and Belkin54g...people are too lazy to come up with a creative name or don't know better.<br>  <br>  If you have FiOS, I recommend changing the default key because it's part of the MAC address by default -- which is easily found out by any passer-by.  Also, I recommend upgrading security to WPA-PSK2 on the advanced page.|`|CArpIOkAaa	Well basically, the owners of these routers are using the default SSID (broadcast id) that came with their routers. Mine is "Naveen's Wireless", but if I reset my setting, It will broadcast teh default name, I forget the name, but it will.

OwAL4V36aa	With those specs and that resolution it should be fine. As long as the CPU has good cooling, which if the casing is fairly large it should, the chances of it 'burning out' are extremely low.<br>  <br>  Intel processors are also very power efficient and if they get too hot they automatically reduce in power in order to cool down (as a safety measure). These days CPUs run quite cool so I highly doubt it'll burn out, even if it's running at maximum capacity.<br>  <br>  Also, that particular CPU is a quad-core (very powerful) and very recent Intel chip so it'll easily handle World of Warcraft.|`|C0ctHpPPaa	dont worry the worst you would get is bad framerate|`|gqm0BfIbaa	your fine|`|SJM0rzHtaa	LCD HDTVs are essentially really big LCD monitors with a TV tuner on-board and multiple inputs.

Apply a layer mask to the layer. Use the black brush to paint on the layer mask (make sure that is where you are, not on the image itself). That will bring the color back to those areas. If you make a mistake, change the brush to white and go over it.<br>  4.

lY1UROfvaa	The answer is yes, as stated by others. The main reason hasn't been said yet, and that's because you can put more programs and temporary data in the faster RAM, it means Windows (or even Linux) doesn't need to touch the page file or any other caching on the hard disk (which is slower than RAM, because it's a rotational mechanical device). Reading and writing to RAM is multiple times faster than any magnetic disk.  So, speed for human operation is much faster (starting Windows, opening and switching programs), but the effective mathematical speed (encoding movies or music, solving math problems) is still the same, because that's the CPU doing the work.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	Yes, RAM is the memory the computer uses to run programs, calculations etc...    As a general rule More RAM = Faster computer|`|89IlUiDNaa	look , ur RAM , is ur Computer "Heart" ,,, as long as it is big and fresh , the data flow will be executed simply speedy , and u gonna feel it actually ... just try it ..|`|RBOzm2oSaa	In Short - Yes.    I believe it has to do with the amount of applications or processes that your particular CPU can handle at any one time. Random Access Memory is what it stands for if that helps at all.|`|TTn6KDp5aa	Yes, it does, but only to a certain extent. RAM is like short-term memory in humans; it's cleared when the computer is shut down. Also, it keep track of what your computer is doing. For instance, that file you typed up in Notepad(or TextEdit on Macs) is being held in RAM so that it isn't lost until you save it to the hard drive. It's more that RAM keeps your computer from slowing down and crashing than making it faster(because it lets your computer keep track of more things at once), but it can seem like it actually improves speed if you start out with an insufficient amount of it for whatever you're using your computer for. RAM also lets you run more programs at once without need for a restart.|`|UQft205Waa	yes and no   if your computer is considerably slower since you bought it then you must have spyware or trojans slowing it down   and you need http://fileforum.betanews.com/download/S...    but back to the question yes but not a great deal eg if you install something or run a app like virus scanner the it depends on both cpu and ram mostly cpu ram stopps it hanging / waiting|`|AA10635339	YES!

syC3uQpjaa	Audio cassettes opened up a world of portability unimaginable in the days when LPs ruled the roost. Now, however, cassette tapes have fallen by the wayside (or, in many cases, have been thrown to the wayside from moving vehicles), and, unlike LPs, they don’t look like making a comeback anytime soon. This poses a problem for those of us who would like to preserve important conversations or good songs that are currently stored on cassettes, not only because audio cassettes eventually deteriorate or get “eaten” by your tape player, but also because cassette players are becoming increasingly rare. Fortunately, you can easily transfer audio from cassettes to your computer, where it can be stored in formats such as WAV and MP3 or can be burned to CDs. In fact, $6 could get you everything you need.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	How much more vague can you get.<br>  <br>  You can zip or rar them and that will compress them but you wont be able to listen to or edit them, you can lower the kbps but that will cut quality.<br>  <br>  Compression kills quality.<br>  <br>  MP3 is popular because it is the best available compression to quality format out there.|`|laofAjTAaa	they are already compressed formats trying to compress further is a waste of time, you can however remaster them reduce the bit rate of video clarity to make them smaller|`|gqm0BfIbaa	have you ever heard of the program called winamp...never tried wav but definately mp3...check out this site <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/compress/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/journal/compres...</a><br>  hope this helps

33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	You need to connect the printer to the network. I assume that router is a WIRELESS (wi-fi) router? If so, you just need to add a wi-fi printer server (which connects to the printer). Your printer may be network ready, but it probably does NOT have a wi-fi adapter built-in. <br>  <br>  You need to investigate how to get your printer onto the wi-fi network. As you did not give any make or model, I can't look it up for you. <br>  <br>  Once it's on the network, the rest is very easy.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Yeah, as long as both the printer and the computer are both connected to the same network, you can access the printer all the way across the house, regardless of the type of connection, wired or wireless.

AA11849917	You're close, but no cigar - yet.    The basic structure of the IF statement is:  =IF(test, true, false)    What you did was:  =IF(((test, true, false)test, true, false) test, true, false) etc.    Replace the False with the next text.  Change it to:  =IF(test1, true, IF(test2, true, IF(test3, true, false) ) )    Each time, if the test is false, it will look at the false part, and do the next test, checking for true or false, etc.    One caveat - watch out for the parenthesis - it's hard to keep them balanced if the test is long or complex.    What I usually do is as soon as I type "IF", I add the opening and closing parentheses right away, then go back and add the contents.  (the only way to do this is to use F2 to edit the cell, otherwise when you use the left arrow, you leave the cell).    So, I start with:  =IF()    I press the F2 Edit key at this time.  I go back one space (left arrow, not back space), and add:  =IF( test, true, "false" )    I then go back and replace the word "false" with IF(), so now I have:  =IF(test, true, IF() )    Left arrow back into the () to create the next level to get:  =IF(test, true, IF(test, true, "false" ) )    Continue like this until you have covered all possible tests.|`|SrfLbfwMaa	Do this    =IF( COUNTIF( G:G, "Valid")=COUNTA( G:G),"Valid", "Error")    This formula does this    If the number of cells in the G column that has the text "Valid" equals the total number of cells in G that are not empty, then it is Valid, if not then it is Error    Meaning  If all cells in G are "Valid" then show "Valid" if one of them is not, then show "Error"    Do not put any other cells in colum G that may have another value.  If you have just do this  =IF( COUNTIF( G:G, "Valid")=COUNTA( G:G)-1,"Valid", "Error")    and -1 if you know that one cell will have another text .

Firstly open up task manager, click Networking tab<br>  <br>  then at the bottom where your internet connection is check the 'Link Speed' and see what that says, mine says 54mbps<br>  <br>  Then go to <a href="http://www.speedtest.net," rel="nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net,</a> run a test from a server as close as possible to you. Then you get your results in KBps which you will have to google to find an address to convert it into mbps and you can see if your connection is going on average what it says you should get.<br>  <br>  Ok then go to <a href="http://www.numion.com/Calculators/Units.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.numion.com/Calculators/Units....</a> and put in your result and make sure you select kbps then look at the mbps result and see what the result is.<br>  <br>  So you were offered 50mb from Virgin Media, can you provide me with an IP address so i can run a speed test on your internet and keep a track on it for a while and see how often it changes, You can get your IP address from <a href="http://www.WhatIsMyIp.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.WhatIsMyIp.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  They can always allocate you 50mb but it doesn't mean it will give you that.<br>  <br>  So yeah i'll run some tests on your internet and see if virgin is giving you what they say they are. I'll run a test over tomorow morning, I'll take the test every 30 minutes for like 2 hours and send back a report of your internet speed.<br>  <br>  Internet can be slowed down by people sending 'packets' to your computer which allocates space on your computer which is also known as a 'DOS attack' Have a look on google about DOS attacks for further information (I'm not saying you're being DOS'ed i'm saying its something that could be took into concideration) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-s...</a><br>  <br>  Did Virgin give you a router?

If you have lets say 4 computers on your network, and you've got 50 mbps internet<br>  <br>  4 computers<br>  50 mbps<br>  (50 / 4 = 12.5)<br>  <br>  So each computer will be at 12.5 mbps.<br>  <br>  But as i said above you're not guaranteed your 50mbps internet they say that, you may get it some times but not always ;)<br>  <br>  Sorry for such a long post and probly none of this has helped but i hope it has ;) I don't have Virgin myself i use Sky.<br>  <br>  If you're using Wireless Internet, it can also depend on the speed your router can send out and what it can send/receive on your wireless network card/adapter. Also visiting a website could have different speeds on it depending on the servers link. and you will find some websites will run extremely slowly, for many reasons, Server is over-loaded / Lots of people on the website, Bad Internet Connection (not fast), There could be alot of stuff that is required to be downloaded (images) to run the page.<br>  <br>  Theres tons of reasons its realy hard to explain.<br>  <br>  So if you cannot manage to find out whats going on with your internet speed soon then all i can say is get in contact with Virgin Media and tell them that they said upto 50mb broadband and you don't think you're getting what they said.. But they'll probly just say they did say "UP TO" which is a big word.<br>  <br>  I'll edit this post tomorow morning i'm tired and need sleep.|`|laofAjTAaa	goto speedtest.net and check the speed from here, virgin are always boasting of true internet speeds, so contact them with your findings,|`|Htvrh3nQaa	haven't got virgin broadband but i have loads of problems with bt im beginning to think its all a lucky dip|`|GczDsniiaa	Remember that your speed will also depend on the internet site you are visiting (you cant download faster than it can upload) and also do you use a wireless modem? Some are only 11mb. You need at least a 54mb if you have a 50mb connection. Worth checking with a speed test site as mentioned, but be prepared the problem could be your end as well!|`|4uJoPz5naa	yeah there tech support probably knows more than any of us so call them up

NRXFNrFRaa	You best bet is to start with getting your CCNA, Cisco Certified Networking Associate. You can take the classes online, at a community college, or some of the IT schools. I would suggest taking them from a community college. .I would suggest if you can take a hybrid or seated class if you can.  There is an excellent online program at Stanly Community College in Albemarle NC. Kelly Caudle is the head of the department. He is an excellent professor and highly honored in his field. It will take you about a year if you go through the college classes- 2 eight week classes for two semesters. The last time I looked the test was around $125.00. If you make an 80 or higher on you last final you can take the test for ? price.  You can look at a starting salary around $45,000 to $50,000 in the Atlanta area. It is a good field to start in. Check out www.cisco.com for more information. For 10 years experience and a CCNA you can earn around $75,000 a year. With the economy the way it is now is a good time to be in school, there are also plenty of scholarships also. Start by filling out a FASA online.<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a>

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.net/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

If it was making a clicking sound before it died it was most likely the hard drive. If the operating system just went wacky chances are you can pull the hard drive out of the computer and put it into another computer that is running the same operating system and pull off the data and reload the Operating System back on the hard drive.  If you have a lot of RAM you can run vista just fine. Both operating systems have their pluses and minuses, as well as, vulnerabilities. It’s for the most part user’s choice. You could also, have the Operating System loaded on one hard drive and store your data on another. You are less likely to lose data if you separate the Operating System from your data. If you do need to purchase a new hard drive, make sure the one you choose has the same voltage and uses the same ghz as the one you were running on the old hard drive. Two good sites are www.newegg.com or www.cdw.com.

That is, it is from a wireless router to a PC not more than 100feet away.

Also, wifi is short-range whereas 3G cellular will work almost-anywhere (anywhere that has 3G cellular service)<br>  <br>  <br>  802.11b is 11Mbps up and down...but the question to ask is what it's connected to.  If you connect your 802.11b router/access-point to a ISP that's only 756Kbps, that's all you get.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For example, I have the cheapest Cox cable-internet and a Belkin 54g router.  802.11g can reach 54Mbps up and down but I can only download at 1.5Mbps and upload at 256Kbps because that's what my service is.

lY1UROfvaa	In some cases, it's really the hard disk dying on you, and you're left with a drive that will cost thousands of dollars to retrieve your data from.    If hard disk is defect, the BIOS usually will say there's no hard disk.  If it does say there is one, then use a linux distro boot CD, and try to use:  badblock /dev/sda -sv  If only a few badblocks appear, you might be able to salvage some data to a USB hard disk.  If there are too many badblocks, it's a lost cause, and you may only salvage some selected smaller files. It will also take considerable more time, since reading over bad blocks means the system tries it for a long time, and skipping ahead is not in its nature.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Well, without knowing exactly what happened to the drive, it's hard to tell. The drive could have died, or something on it became corrupted, preventing it from booting.    I could regale you with a number of ways to get a Linux recovery CD that will boot the system and help with your recovery, but I'm not certain this would help you.

X9dbwfVNaa	OSI Model    Layer 1, The Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for packaging and transmitting data on the physical media. This layer conveys the bit stream through a network at the electrical and mechanical level.     Layer 2, The Data-Link Layer: The data-link layer is responsible for error free transfer of data frames. This layer provides synchronization for the physical layer.     Layer 3, The Network Layer: The network layer controls the operation of the subnet. It determines the physical path that data takes on the basis of network conditions, priority of service, and other factors. The network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data packets.     Layer 4, The Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures that messages are delivered in the order in which they are sent and that there is no loss or duplication. It ensures complete data transfer.     Layer 5, The Session Layer: The session layer establishes a communication session between processes running on different communication entities in a network and can support a message-mode data transfer. It deals with session and connection coordination.     Layer 6, The Presentation Layer: The presentation layer serves as the data translator for a network. It is usually a part of an operating system and converts incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another. This layer is also known as syntax layer.     Layer 7, The Application Layer: The application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network services. It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation, etc. This layer is not an application in itself, although some applications may perform application layer functions.       DOD Model    Layer 1, Network Interface Layer: The network interface layer is the lowest layer in the DoD model. This layer is responsible for putting frames on the wire and pulling frames off the wire. It is equivalent to the data-link and physical layers of the OSI model.     Layer 2, Internet Layer: The Internet layer provides three services - a connectionless delivery service, a mechanism to break data into individual packets or frames on the transmitting side and put them back together on the receiving side, and the routing functions necessary to interoperate with other networks. It is equivalent to the network layer of the OSI model.    Layer 3, Transport Layer: The transport layer provides communication sessions between connected computers. This layer is responsible for error detection and correction. It is also known as host-to-host or transmission layer and is equivalent to the transport layer of the OSI model.    Layer 4, Application Layer: The application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network services. Several standard TCP/IP utilities and services exist at the application layer. It is equivalent to the application, presentation, and session layers of the OSI model.|`|N4vDuY74aa	DOD is (US`s)Department Of Defense.TCP/IP is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.TCP/IP follows OSI (Open System Internetworking)model.

AygEpMMaaa	download pc tools disk suite,it has a 45 day trial but lets u use all its features in that 45 days    http://www.pctools.com/disk-suite/      Disk Suite is an all-in-one hard-drive management utility that integrates disk optimization and cleanup, defrag and backup in one easy to use package. Disk Suite puts a range of tools at your fingertips to provide optimum system performance and improved stability and security.    Clean and Optimize  With Disk Suite you can safely Cleanup and Optimize your Windows? disks with a few simple mouse clicks. Disks can become bloated with temporary files, log files and other unnecessary data. The Cleanup and Optimize feature lets you safely remove unnecessary files and bloat from your PC without detailed knowledge of the Windows? file system. Removing bloat will not only make your PC perform better, but will also provide you with more free space to store your own files.    Disk Defrag  It's a fact that fragmented drives drain critical system resources, compromise the ability to access your files efficiently and slow down Windows? start-up.    Defragmentation is one of the best methods of boosting system performance by optimizing the way files are arranged on the disk. By reorganizing the files using the disk defrag feature, the process of accessing those files becomes more efficient, creates a greater amount of free space on the hard drive and allows you to use that space more effectively.    The defrag feature provides you with a powerful defragmentation tool that supports both NTFS and FAT file systems. Different levels of defragmentation are provided in case you just need a quick defrag or you want to schedule a complete optimization of your disk.    Backup & Restore  The Backup feature allows you to make copies of your data that can be restored in the event that files become lost, damaged or corrupted. Taking regular backup is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure you dont lose irreplaceable data and files such as photos, documents and other information.    The Backup feature in Disk Suite allows you to tailor the backup to meet your needs by selectively choosing the files to protect. It also allows you to restore files as needed, and verify your backup to ensure valuable data can be recovered as needed.    Diagnostics and Repair  Physical disk and file corruption is one of the main causes of data loss. The Repair feature allows you to actively monitor the health of your disk and file systems and where possible repair corruption and errors. It also allows you to schedule or directly run different types of disk integrity checks and identify future disk corruption so issues can be quickly discovered and resolved.    The repair feature performs integrity checks to check file system structure, surface scans to check for bad sectors and disk errors as well as repair hard drive problems. In addition the repair feature includes hard disk diagnostics and lets you review the information including the S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) status of your hard drive (if supported).    PC Tools Disk Suite Full Version Information  Current Version: 2009 (1.0.0.57)   File Size: 5,852 KB   Operating System: Designed for Windows? Vista? 32-bit, XP and 2000   Release Date: November 17, 2008   Designed to: Manage your disks for optimal performance and security.   Trial Limitations: The trial offers a 45-day unlimited trial of all features.|`|N37Udp4Iaa	Make sure you close as many programs and processes as possible. Windows 98 is terrible for getting so far through a defrag and then restarting because a process or program has changed some data.

The extra pins help with current demands for newer CPU and video cards, memory, etc. So, most Power Supply makers have been offering their supplies with a 20-pin and a 4-pin which kinda lock together to look like a 24-pin for most newer applications, and will still work with older Motherboards that only need 20-pins. (The 4 extra pins simply dangle unconnected in the other case scenerio)|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	First poster explained it perfectly.  The 20+4 works with either 20-pin or 24-pin motherboards.

bBvdvqDVaa	Hello, as a computer programmer myself, I come to this conclusion.<br>  <br>  Don't expect to use what you learned as school for your work. Most likely, you'll have to re-learn on the job anyway. HOWEVER, your schooling will "expose" you to what's out there and shape your way of thinking. Obviously, the more you learn, the sharper your way of thinking would be.<br>  <br>  Another thing that I learned, just like any other jobs that anyone does, people who love it would do it better. People who "live and breathe" programming, would yield a much better code than the one (eventhough he went all the way in school) that doesn't like coding.<br>  <br>  So my opinion is, do what you like. If you like what you do, you'll excel on it and if you excel on anything, you should be able to make a living out of it.|`|DWU0iCbVaa	This is the BLS for Software Engineers, Read it over, you see that it states "Job prospects should be excellent, as computer software engineers are expected to be among the fastest-growing occupations through the year 2016."

A masters may give you an edge but in reality companies want hands on experience from what I have seen. Real world experience goes a lot farther than classroom experience. I got a shock when I got out of school of how little I actually really knew coming into the market place. I can't see the demand for programmers diminishing in the future. The only problem I can see is the outsourcing of programming positions but I believe there will always be a future for programmers. <br>  <br>  Oh yea, a B.S should be 4 years and a masters another 2...

TRLsiqZOaa	You might be able to lock his account, which will force him to change his password. <br>  <br>  Every website, program, and service has slightly different policies regarding passwords. On many, if you try to log in to an account with an incorrect password a certain number of times (usually three to five), the user will be emailed a new password, and the old one will no longer work. Hopefully, when he reads the email, he'll realise that he should change it AGAIN because no one should no your password except you, including the company that runs the website program or service you're logging in to. <br>  <br>  Other websites have a "FORGOT YOUR PASSWROD" link that will either reset your password, email it to you, or ask you a security question. Resseting would work, but emailing would only let him know that some one clicked the "FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD" link. Answering the security question wrong too many times may also lock the account, forcing a password change. <br>  <br>  Unfortunatly there is usually no way to know what method each website uses, and if you're talking about breaking into a webmail account such as Yahoo or Hotmail, then the point is moot. <br>  <br>  Obviously you feel bad about what you are doing, but I'm not going to get into the right or wrong about it, since you asked not to. But since you *do* feel bad, it shows that you actually care enough about your boyfriend, or at least are begining to respect his privacey enough, that you want to stop doing it. Coming clean might be the best option, but it depends on the relationship.|`|wjtH6Bj2aa	Just tell him that he should change his password. It may be on the list of top 500 passwords if it is easy enough for you to guess... just find a security reason.<br>  <br>  Or just tell him, teasingly, that you figured out his password and he should really change it because other people could too.<br>  <br>  As long as you don't seem guilty and don't act guilty, he won't think you've done anything wrong.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend you honestly take a look at yourself and think about whether you may have trust issues with him.|`|XucYKJgaaa	either train yourself to stop, or tell him to change his password. if he asks why, just tell him that you have to change your password once in a  while to ensure safety. if he still presses you, or if he doesn't buy it, think of something fast.|`|yPKrBiIhaa	hve him change his password and if he asks y just explain that there has been a recent rise in the number of computers hacked this year|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	maybe u should tell him to change his password cuz your friend figured it out or something... idk. <br>  or just tell the truth lol :)|`|zw3rrCoYaa	How can you not stop?

MPldgkkMaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III. Computer Restarts After Download?<br>  <br>  This can also be a virus or spyware problem. I suggest you go through your Control Panel / Add or Remove Programs list and remove any programs you don't need, then run thorough anti-virus and anti-spyware scans.  See:<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com</a>|`|HBMEXyodaa	It is probably related to a memory issue, but I would do the following instructions to disable the automatic restart.

LpCDltJMaa	The difference between Safe Mode and Regular Mode, is the services/programs/processes that safe mode doesn't use, Safe Mode just disables any "extra" services/programs/processes to run, to ensure safe environment for troubleshooting..    In general what gets a computer to be slow over time is the more useage of RAM, CPU, and other computer resources.. To know what is running hit ctrl + alt + delete to see the task manager, in the processes tab you can see what is your computer running, google the processes you don't know to see if it is needed by your system or by you. Sometimes most processes are just extra, or running programs that you do not need to be running all the time..    You can uninstall a program if you don't need it on your computer, or even disable unwanted services. If you go to start --> run and type msconfig then hit enter it will show you configuration for your MS Windows, clicking on the Startup tab will show you the programs that autorun on the Windows start up, you do not need ALL of them to automatically run, you can disable ALL of them and it will not harm your computer, for me.. I keep msn messenger and yahoo messenger in that list, most of the other items are disabled..    To uninstall a program you go to start --> control panel --> Add or Remove programs.    To stop a service, you go to start --> control panel --> administrative tools --> services, make sure to google the service if you do not know what it does for you.    You can also make defragmentation for your computer to make it faster, by going to start --> all programs --> accessories --> system tools, disk defragmenter.

5zSSGKBpaa	Linux xp is a version of linux that is sold by some Russian outfit. They do not provide any information on how to install, configure, setup any hardware, troubleshoot, or anything. All their support is for a fee. No one can help much with linux xp.  I would suggest that you get a free copy of linux, download it, burn it as an iso and install it. There is plenty of free documentation and support with the other versions.  You should go to :  http://distrowatch.com/search.php  and use the search engine to filter which distro would be best for you. You can select a version for beginners, or multimedia, or a special purpose. They are all free to download. You can read reviews and articles about each distro. You can select a distro for ease of use, needs little ram  or hard drive space, popularity, most software packages available, amount of  customization,etc.    I would suggest that you go to that distros website to read their documentation, especially if you are new to linux. They have tutorials on how to install, how to setup various hardware, and tips and tricks. I would also recommend using their forum to search/ask for info/help.    If altnet is generally available on the web linux can access it.  Linux has many media players and can play any format. Real player is available with linux and can play windows media files.  Good luck|`|AA10951228	This question makes absolutely no sense.|`|KNppmXiXaa	Please read your question back to yourself and see if it makes any sense.  The best I can tell is that you have a Windows 2000 system and want to install "linux xp 2008 so" on to it.  Next your question takes another direction asking about downloading music from altnet.  After that, you are telling us that you need a version of media player 10 or 11.    1) Linux XP 2008 - The underlying OS (Windows 2000) is not relative to installing Linux XP 2008.  You can install it as a replacement to Windows 2000 or you could look at dual boot options (beyond a simple answer here).    2) I'm not familiar with altnet but if they require a certain software application for downloading music (to support DRM), you'll need to follow their requirements.  Some sites may require use of their own "player" software or they may add codecs or addons to existing applications.    3) Media Player 10/11 can be downloaded from Microsoft as an update and probably as a direct download from Microsoft.  I don't know if they are compatible with Windows 2000.  Unless Linux XP 2008 includes an application like WINE, you wouldn't be able to run it on that OS.

(Control Panel> User Accounts> Create an Account; Limited)  On that they can have their own wallpaper & screensaver, 'My Pictures' folder of just their photo's, desktop icons for specific kid oriented applications, and so on.  This can omit a lot of aggravation for them, & you don't have to constantly assist them find things.  You (administrator) can install 'parental controls' to take out some of the risk of random website viewing, and for the really younger ones, dedicated browsers just for kids can be used for sites specific to juveniles.  Added benefits are much greater security (virus threats, undesirable applications, and peer-2-peer files sharing can be drastically curtailed).    Parental guardian applications allow the admin.

Do you really think they'll try and go back in a hurry?  And even if you ban that one site, there's still millions of other websites out there featuring questionable content.    As soon as you start blocking them from seeing things, its in a young person's inquisitive nature to want to find out what it was. They're probably more likely to try and visit dodgy sites if you put the restrictions there than if you just let them find out for themselves and make their own minds up about things.    Plus you can't hide them away from the big bad world forever.    Stumbling across bad stuff is just all part of the natural process of learning about the world around you and maturing as a person.

a2ZUE0U5aa	Ok here is the problem you need to download a copy of windows <br>  <br>  "I can only assume that I need to have an XP HOME OEM with no service packs streamlined into it?"<br>  <br>  That is true. I know this is not the answer you are looking for but you might need to download it from a torrent site. Sorry.<br>  <br>  The other option is you could try to remove the Service packs from the install cd. To do that I would download a free program called "Nlite". <br>  <br>  Link here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nliteos.com/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nliteos.com/download.html</a><br>  <br>  Now this is a free program so no cost for using it. After you installed Nlite there is an option to remove the Service Packs. You will have to open your original install disk and extract the files to your computer then open those files using Nlite. Then make an iso image with Nlite without the Service Packs. After you have the new iso image you will have to burn that image to disk. Insert that disk into the other computer and cross your fingers. <br>  <br>  Note: this is how you add drivers to an install cd for xp also<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|MoUtk7cUaa	mostly, because the oem is different from retail.  the oem that came w/ the dell came w/ an agreement that dell will support it, not microsoft.  your best best is to get the user to provide you with the in box recovery discs, get a copy of sp3 (or sp2 if you think it will cause more problems) on cd, you can order them from ms, in order to do a good job.<br>  also, the post above is inaccurate. you're using a key that doesn't go w/ that machine/system.  back to the oem issue i described. i have had the above mentioned issue on the same machine as i test many programs and eventually need to restore it.  the 2 are unrelated.|`|kIy2bdiraa	I have used old dell computers CD keys many times.  You can do it, but you have to have the corresponding service pack install disk.  You can use the Dell XP cd to install xp onto the new machine.<br>  <br>  The thing that I have found with the Dell CD keys is that you can only use them once before they won't activate again, even if you don't change hardware.  I don't know why that is.<br>  <br>  I was told once that if you call Microsoft when you are trying to activate, you can tell them that you are transferring your copy of XP to another computer and you won't be using your dell anymore, and they will reactivate it for you.|`|zId5dRS1aa	I've had this problem before. The key can only be used a certain amount of times before it's flagged suspicious.

Yes, you'd need a XP HOME OEM installation cd, not the XP HOME SP2 OEM one. =\  This also has happened to me before. The key is tailored directly to the type of installation you're doing.

NEWEGG!!|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is a type of motherboard made by Foxconn  ( <a href="http://www.foxconnchannel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxconnchannel.com/</a> ) for the AMD platform (the WinFast brand name was licensed from Leadtek).<br>  <br>  Foxconn, a traditional OEM manufacturer, has entered the retail market with its own motherboard line.<br>  <br>  These motherboards seem well received judging by some of the reviews I have found ( Example: <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/article/328/1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.legitreviews.com/article/328/...</a> )<br>  <br>  <br>  Now for your problems, freezing happens in Video and moving graphics performance for lots of reasons but mainly for lack of RAM or struggling PSU.<br>  <br>  In other areas, freezing could be happening because of accumulated junk or presence of virus.<br>  <br>  Here are a few solutions to start:<br>  <br>  1) You should run a FULL scan with virus/adware/spyware/malware scanners.<br>  <br>  2) You should clean your PC with Windows built-in "Disk Cleanup" OR (for a better job) use this free one: <a href="http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html</a><br>  <br>  3) You should defragment your PC with Windows built-in "Disk Defragmenter" OR (again for a better job) use this free one: <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/overv...</a><br>  <br>  4) Shut down (reboot) your PC as this will clean your Virtual memory space.<br>  <br>  5) To make sure of optimal performance of the swap file (Virtual Memory), follow the method outlined below<br>  <br>  Virtual memory, also called page file or swap file, is a file on your hard drive (C:\pagefile.sys by default) that Windows and applications use in addition to physical memory (RAM) as needed.<br>  <br>  The rule of thumbs for the size of this file is 1.5 times the amount of physical memory, it is also recommended to make the minimum and maximum size the same to avoid serious fragmentation.<br>  <br>  Here are a few examples: 512 MB RAM = 768 MB Page File - 1 GB (1024 MB) RAM = 1.5 GB (1536 MB) Page File - 2 GB (2048 MB) RAM = 3 GB (3072 MB) Page File - 3 GB (3072 MB) RAM = 4.5 GB (4608 MB) Page File and so on.<br>  <br>  Getting your paging file into shape is a simple operation, if you're confident delving into submenus and manually making adjustments. <br>  <br>  In Windows XP, open your My Computer Properties, then under the Advanced tab click on Performance Settings, hit the Advanced tab in the new window, and click on Virtual Memory Change. The paging file should be set to at least 1.5 times the amount of RAM onboard. Many experts caution against any smaller than that. Set both the Initial Size and Maximum Size to the same level. By doing this, you prevent the paging file from growing incrementally and adding to disk fragmentation.<br>  <br>  ( Don't worry about making all those operations, as long as you go slowly and follow the steps in order, everything will be fine (I know because I've done it many times and I wasn't an expert the first time) )<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: This operation needs to be done only once and will only need to be repeated if you change the amount of RAM.<br>  <br>  If you have more than one drive, the paging file should always be on the "FASTEST" drive not just the biggest one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now if these steps do not correct the problems, I would look at the hardware side ( RAM and PSU first )<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|XlyLakYAaa	Freezing is usually caused by some kind of malware.

RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

pyTBL5igaa	Depends, Check to see if you have it in the slot labeled something like CPU_FAN. If not then its possible your bearings went out or something else went wrong and it wont start. Fans don't just work when they need to. You really need that fan because without it your processor would most likely overheat resulting in a lot of problems.

3uqHPEFDaa	Those first two lines seem quite hardware specific, so I can't help you.<br>  <br>  Now the second one, it usually means that your hard disk has a broken operating system (which is the case since you wiped it out).<br>  <br>  You're inserting the recovery disk but two things may be happening:<br>  <br>  1. It may not be an actual bootable recovery disk - meaning that it won't boot your computer unless you get a bootable disk or an original windows disk<br>  <br>  2. Your computer may be configured to ignore cds while booting - in this case you should access the BIOS of your computer and enable the CDROM boot feature.<br>  <br>  Now, how to enable the CDROM boot feature:<br>  as soon as you turn your computer on, start repeatedly pressing the DEL and the F2 key - one of these should bring up the BIOS setup screen - if this doesn't work, check your manual on how to do it - once in the BIOS setup, check for boot settings and enable CDROM boot, making sure that CDROM is the first on the boot list.|`|ebuxHnScaa	Since you wiped the hard drive, there is no operating system on the hard drive. You have to tell the computer to boot from the recovery disk. How you do this depends on what motherboard you have. The most common way is by pushing 'F8' during the memory test, waiting for the boot selection menu to pop up, and then selecting the CD/DVD drive with the arrow keys and pushing enter.<br>  <br>  Some computers require you to go into the BIOS setup, make the CD/DVD drive the first boot device, do the recovery, then go back in and make the hard drive first.|`|0YT04B43aa	yes, that happens because you erased the files that let the computer read the recovery discs. in other words you destroyer the house and now you cannot put the furniture inside because you don't have a house. You will need an operating system disc. Windows XP perhaps if that's what you were running. You need to know that a recovery disc is not always an operating system. Another thing is, if you have the operating system, the cable connected to your dvd drive/cd rom. Make sure it is properly connected.|`|OkJp8W4naa	If your computer is not  recognizing recovery disk, then there is a problem of your recovery software.<br>  <br>  So, use this software which very helpful and best >>> <a href="http://www.mdofpc.com/onlinestore/ontrack-easy-recovery-professional-standard-download-p-6651.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdofpc.com/onlinestore/ontrac...</a>

Lastly, then select the "Immunize" button to prevent any more of that crap from entering your system.<br>  <br>  2. If your PC is moving slow still, you should clear your Temporary Internet Files by going to Tools on the menu bar and selecting Internet Options and then Delete Browsing History (always include the Temporary Internet files option if prompted).  <br>  <br>  Additionally, you should Defragment your hard drive regardless.

maMeeV4caa	First of all, it is not possible for chargers to "synchronize" with another laptop. However, there are many possible problems associated with this.<br>  <br>  Does your laptop turn on with the ac adapter plugged in but the battery is taken out? If it does, the the problem is your battery, if it doesn't, most likely the problem is with your ac adapter.<br>  <br>  So my advice would be to buy either a new battery or a new ac adapter depending on what the problem is. If the problem is your ac adapter, buy from this website because they offer life time warranty to all laptop ac adapter at a price much cheaper than HP.<br>  <a href="http://www.topmicrousa.com/compaq-hp-pavilion-dv6000--cto--ac-adapter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmicrousa.com/compaq-hp-pav...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Usually this problem is a damaged power socket on the laptop.<br>  <br>  If the plug feels wobbly when plugged in then the power socket will have broken loose from the motherboard, can sometimes be fixed but probably not cheap.<br>  <br>  You may be able to wobble it till it connects and wedge it there till you get a charge, but thats not a long term solution.<br>  <br>  If your battery is the same as your sis's, charge it in her lappy, then swap it back to yours would be another short term fix.<br>  <br>  One of the above temporary fixes should be enough to let you make a copy of any important stuff.

lye7pmabaa	hi,<br>  <br>  The reason this is happening is because the settings you changed were incorrect and when the computer boots up it is reading the usb device as a hard derive so it searches this drive for a boot image which is installed on the hard drive  my advice would be to either remove the usb and enter boot options and boot from hard drive or go into settings and disable usb on start up but please make sure you are using ps2 devices so your keyboard and mouse are not affected.|`|LVx6UZxSaa	Thumb drive as RAM? what exactly did you do? you cant turn thumb drives into RAM

99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	You'll need an ISO creater, like ROXIO, NERO or other freeware. They will allow you to create an ISO IMAGE of any number of files, and then you can burn that ISO back to a CDR media whenever you like.  It's alot of work to just burn a disk. An easier way is to simply DRAG the EXE to a blank CDR media in your burner. Windows will allow the writing to occur quite easily and never have to mess with knowing about the intermediate ISO image. (Not really needed)|`|IbxhRebgaa	An ISO is not an executable. An ISO is a CD or DVD image.

You made a game that runs as an .exe(executable) file, and you want to make it into an .iso?  .iso is an extension used for creating cd/dvd's.  So if that's what you're trying to do is make it so you can create a cd with the game on it, there are plenty of ways.  First, do you have nero/roxio or another cd/dvd creator?  If you do, then you would begin a new project, and add the files (the .exe in this case and any files that the .exe needs with it to run properly) to the project.  Proceed following the directions from there.  The only variation from the normal routine in this, is that when you choose your destination, instead of choosing "Sony CDRW" or whatever it is called in your case, you would change that option via the drop-down menu to "Image Recorder" or something of the like.  Not all burner softwares will save an .iso image, but they will have something.  .nrg, .img, .iso, all are common image formats.  Another option is to find a free program to create an image file, like <a href="http://www.nbxsoft.com/download-create-burn-iso.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nbxsoft.com/download-create-b...</a><br>  "Free Create-Burn ISO"  I haven't tried this one, but just pop a search for "create .iso image file" and hunt around, you'll find one.  They'll probably be very similar to the above instructions.  <br>  --Side question:  Do you just want to burn the game to a CD?  If so, there's no real reason to make it into an .iso first.  Save a step or two, and just burn the files you want directly to the cd.  You would follow the above instructions, but leave the destination as the "Sony CDRW" or whatever your burner is called in your case.  Creating an ISO image is great if you want to make a copy of a cd that you can send over the internet to someone, but that and/or mass production of a cd are the only real good reasons to do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as specified in the passwd file and the group vector is initialized based on the group file (unless the -P option was specified).  If the invoking user is root or if the target user is the same as the invoking user, no password is required.  Otherwise, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password by default (NOTE: in the default configuration this is the user's password, not the root password).  Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers).<br>  <br>  To get a further explanation on your own Mac, launch the Terminal Application, and enter:<br>  <br>  man sudo<br>  <br>  and hit "Return"<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.

On the other hand when the computer is slow this could be a number of problems you may have to perform a disk defrag.

It is usually synchronised to a fraction of the cpu cycle speed though. This disparity in speed is one cause of bottle necking.<br>  <br>  in 1989 memory speed may have been running at 11mhz and 16 bits whereas today it will be running at possibly 800mhz and be 64bits<br>  <br>  now... because software has become so large in modern computers it's definetly a good idea to get as much memory as you can. <br>  <br>  One thing that happen if you have a lot of software installed and running is that the computer can run out of memory. The operating system (windows) usually wont tell you this but when the computer starts to run out of memory to store its data it will use the hard disk as a third storage space (virtual memory) for working data. <br>  <br>  hard disks are even slower than memory so this data transfering between memory and causes another bottleneck which is very noticeable to the user.<br>  <br>  this wasnt a problem on 20yr old computers though. they didnt use virtual memory.<br>  Of course hard disks have beome faster and continue to, but they are still a mechanical device so much slower than the electronic memory.<br>  <br>  using virtual memory excessively will really slow a computer to crawl. <br>  <br>  windows vista now has a feature that allows the use of flash memory sticks as virtaul memory devices which helps a little because flash memory is electronic. some are faster than others though.<br>  <br>  Now as regards to internet speed, any modern computer from the past 15 years can handle the data coming in from the internet, its a trickle compared to what goes on inside the computer.<br>  <br>  If your internet seems slow it may because you don't have enough memory for the computer to deal with the multimedia aspects of the internet or it might be down to your internet connection being slow, because you are far from an exchange.|`|wBnLB369aa	computers are slow if they have a virus.<br>  computers are fast if they didn't have a virus.<br>  if you are wondering why the internet is slower or faster its because if you have high speed then your computer well be very fast other wise it wont. <br>  if your computer is very slow because of a virus use Norton Anti Virus.<br>  if your computer is fast then good for you!|`|glFDVwklaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|3dV5RFnnaa	Ok, if you have a windows then it will DEFINETELY be slow, if its a mac on the other hand it is REALLY quick. thats what makes a computer faster and better! ;)|`|XeLZtw20aa	A faster processor more memory less viruses and high speed internet it works even better if you are directly connected to the internet source so your computer doesn't have to search for the connection|`|bnoWoxi0aa	COMPUTER'S are all different usually if u have DSL it will make ur computer 2 or 3 times fasterr!!!! it helps alot!! & also it depends on if u have a good computer.|`|3XBcxTo4aa	a processer has big role and videocards<br>  virus and lots of programs make comp run slow|`|JM9L2c9Faa	bc your computer is old and crappy go get a new one at your local walmart

Most Tutorials for C++ don't get into OOP until the latter half, so there is plenty of groundwork laid down with simple concepts, like control structures, first before you delve into the more advanced stuff. <br>  Also Languages like java and C# are have almost the same syntax and logic as C++, the only major difference is they are Single Paradigm, meaning that they are strictly OOP, and they have some very nice GUI capabilities. So once you learn C++ you can take your new OOP programming skills and pick up other languages with little trouble, something that you cannot do with C.

I live in a two room apartment, and I can't get online wirelessly if I'm more than half a room away. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the answer is no. Since your router, WRT54G, sends out a hybrid 802.11b/g signal, getting an 802.11n wireless card won't help, since it will still be picking up the same b/g signal.<br>  <br>  Both you and I should really just get better routers or wireless range extenders. I'm too cheap though. That's my excuse.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the tl;dr version is this: <br>  you would need to get an 802.11n router also to see any benefit from an 802.11n wifi card.
jGgOVd5Zaa	If you are doing it just for fun, read up on overclocking, but you won't get much from a P III.  Tom's Hardware has a lot of informative articles.  If it's a desktop you are probably better off upgrading.  If it's a laptop you are probably better off replacing it if it isn't doing what you need it to do.<br>  <br>  If you want to squeeze the most performance out of an old computer, first check to see if you have as much RAM as will fit on your motherboard as possible, but with an old computer like unless you can scrounge up some RAM off of other old computers it will be cheaper both in the short term and long term to upgrade your motherboard/processor/RAM in one shot.  <br>  <br>  Check your motherboard specs to see if your motherboard supports a higher processor.  P III computers probably don't even have a good enough power supply to power a new computer.  The only thing salvageable would be the box and maybe the hard drive.  If you do decide to upgrade make sure you keep all your software disks and the stickers with the software ID (sometimes the stickers will be stuck right to the box).|`|7aqEtfLRaa	You could try overclocking it, but that requires special cooling and other things, and it might not even work.

You will not see any gains in performance on that old thing.|`|HBMEXyodaa	No.  Your processor speed is what it is.<br>  <br>  From what I know overclocking generally gives you a slight increase, such as 200 to 233 MHz.

Apple takes a minimalistic approach to their hardware design and they make that a priority when creating hardware.  I haven't seen a PC manufacturer build a 17" laptop that's as light or thin as the MacBook Pro, but there may be one out there.  It's not that it's impossible, it's just a matter of the approach.  The Mac laptops are generally lighter and smaller than a PC with the same specs, but you can of course find ultra-thin PC notebooks like the ones Sony offers that have 12" screens and weight about 3 pounds.<br>  <br>  If you look at Apple's Mac Pro (desktop line) then the tower is pretty big, but this is to be expected since it's packed with 2 Xeon chips and plenty of expandable bays and slots.

1oEChRUiaa	You have a couple of issues here. First the wireless router will work with the desktop because you are providing a wired signal of sorts to it. You might have the wireless turned off on your router, the passphrase key may be wrong, the encryption type may be set differently on your laptop or router as well i.e. WPA, WEP, TKIP + AES, etc. These are all things you'd need to check up on. If its not connecting, let us know the type/model of laptop you are using and whether you're using a PCI card or internal wireless. <br>  <br>  Some steps you can try in the meantime are:<br>  <br>  1) Try refreshing your IP<br>  <br>  Start > Run > type in CMD > Hit enter.<br>  Once the dos applet is open, type in IPCONFIG /RELEASE<br>  You should get a 'not connected error in windows'<br>  Then back in the dos screen type IPCONFIG /RENEW<br>  Your IP address should automatically renew.<br>  <br>  <br>  2). Make sure that you use the correct ports on the router. <br>  <br>  You should be going from cable modem to Uplink on wireless router, and then use Port 2 or 4 for the PC.<br>  <br>  3). Check your Device Manager for errors.<br>  <br>  Go to My Computer > Right Click the icon > Choose Properties, go to the harware tab, then device manager, and report back of any issues.<br>  <br>  <br>  Send an email to me, I'll probably be able to help you out better there.|`|wgAQK2GNaa	Try:<br>  <br>  Start -> Run (or windows key + R) then type ping google.com<br>  <br>  Also, more information would help, what OS are you running? When it has worked, have you changed anything? What modem is it and what service are you receiving (broadband, cable etc).|`|7nimzIDsaa	Got to command prompt.<br>  <br>  Run > type cmd > ipconfig /all<br>  <br>  See if there are details return like your ip add, mac address, subnet mask.<br>  <br>  If the value is null, do the following<br>  <br>  ipconfig /renew.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Need waaay more details than this.  We can assume you're using wireless.  Are you sure you're connected to your wireless instead of someone else's with the same name?  Does the desktop connect to the internet? Are you getting proper DNS on the wireless connection(ie can you ping www.yahoo.com)  Can you ping 4.2.2.2 ?  There are several dozen other troubleshooting steps I could take you through but without you being able to answer them it makes this really hard.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok since you can't get access even wired then there's a problem with the laptop.  Try to disconnect your desktop and use the same port on the router for the laptop.  Other than that without sitting and playing with it to figure out your issue I'm kind of stuck.

If this problem presist check your IDE cable plug in on your hard drive HDD and try again. if you dont have a windows cd or factory recovery master cd then your pretty much finished... Note sometimes makeing sure your drive plug ins are tightly connected first as it might resolve the problem but probally not. because i belive this is problem is more at a kernal level intergration.|`|rRQqx7zoaa	Could be hard drive failure.  If you take it to the shop they will charge you $200 to reformat it, on top of whatever they charge you to  just assess what's wrong.  (Reformatting ANYONE can do...it's a joke they charge more than $20).  <br>  <br>  So they'll hit you with that, and if that doesn't fix it that will confirm it's a hardware issue, most likely the hard drive.  Which of course you'll have to pay probably double what you did before to get a new drive, transfer old files, install it, put windows on it, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  (If you press F8 to get boot options; e.g. "Safe Mode" and it still blue screens, then I can almost promise you it's hardware related)
T17pbHVJaa	None should work.<br>  <br>  School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.<br>  <br>  Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.<br>  <br>  All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.|`|ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually.

TRLsiqZOaa	I had (have) the exact same problem with my Acer laptop. I believe the touch pad is an ALPS product. The only was I was able to fix it was buy using this little USB mouse I picked up for ten bucks at Big Lots that had a built in reel to keep the cord wound up... until it broke. <br>  <br>  I know that you said that you're not accidently touching the mouse pad, and believe me, neither was I. For some reason or another, my touchpad is so sensitive that if I wiggle my finger up and down close enough to the pad, it registers as a click. <br>  <br>  To rule out an  overly sensitive touch pad, try disabling it with a hot key while you type and see if that helps. If not, then it very well could be a virus or other malicious software of some sort, but is more likely a driver issue. If it does stop the problem, then it is your touchpad. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW, I looked at your answers profile and, I like video games and drinking too! They're a winning combination!|`|Pkxcu8zOaa	Its not a virus.Its just that UR touch pad is too sensitive.Just make sure U don't wriggle UR fingers on it just like the other answerer sais.

syC3uQpjaa	Purchase the right webcam. There are many different kinds available:<br>  <br>  <br>  Video-conferencing cameras are made to plug into the computer so you can chat with someone while recording simultaneously. They usually cost $30-50.[1] <br>  A monitoring webcam has its own little Web server built in and is designed to transmit images through the Internet so you can watch someone or something. They're usually upwards of $200. To install one, you'll need an Internet-sharing router with Wi-Fi support.[1] <br>  If you're using the camera for security or monitoring purposes, consider purchasing a wireless model. Look for wireless 802.11b/g with support for WEP or WPA/WPA2 encryption.[1] <br>  Additional features to consider:<br>  <br>  <br>  external microphone <br>  motion sensor <br>  e-mail alerts plus a clip or still image of an event that trips the motion sensor <br>  remote-accessible pan/tilt/zoom so you can log into the camera on the Internet and move its view around, including zoom. <br>  bundled software for handling multiple cameras <br>  If you have a camcorder, you might be able to hack it into a webcam: How to Turn a Regular Video Camcorder Into a Webcam <br>  Back up the computer's hard drive before installing anything, just in case. That way, if anything goes wrong with the installation, you won't lose any data. <br>  Check for an updated version of the webcam software online. If there is an updated version, use that instead. <br>  Read and follow the quick-start guide. You'll be instructed to load the webcam software, and it will tell you when to plug in the webcam with a USB cable. If you plug in the webcam at the wrong time, that'll cause problems. If that does happen, here's what to do:[2]<br>  <br>  <br>  Uninstall existing camera installations (Start > Settings > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs) <br>  Unplug the webcam <br>  Reboot the computer <br>  Load the webcam installation software again, and this time, wait until you're prompted before you plug in the USB cable! <br>  Tell your computer what to do with the images.

h0hSIgC1aa	it's safe, as long as you can get rid of the extra heat generated by overclocking.<br>  <br>  Your motherboard capability will determine if you can do this, lock your PCIE at 100mhz and then set your memory multiplier for below it's rated speed then turn up the FSB.<br>  <br>  I have my E4600/2.4g running at 3.2G at auto core volts, and it is stable - I also have a Scythe Ninja Plus so it stays below 50C, no worries.<br>  <br>  Here is the guide I referred to when setting my BIOS, it should be very similiar to yours (and maybe better, since your multi is lower than mine :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.legionhardware.com/document.php?id=700" rel="nofollow">http://www.legionhardware.com/document.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|ekEUZ216aa	do it via the bios when starting up and as long as u get rid of any heat problems it is safe|`|cTPtm1UQaa	that is a good guide desslock posted it explains a lot.<br>  <br>  I have an e2160(1.8ghz) on an MSI board & ddr2-533 it runs at 2.8Ghz on the stock core voltage, and I even have the OEM heatsink.<br>  <br>  I agree that you may have to mod your case or get a bigger heatsink there is a bit more heat generated - I just put an 80mm fan in the side panel hole to blow down on the OEM intel heatsink, that did the job.  I also did not want to increate the volts too much and just keep it at the mobo defaults.<br>  <br>  What a difference, if you run image editors like Gimp (say creating your own hi-res backgrounds, or looking at girlie pix :) it feels almost double speed as the stock speed - well technically only 35% faster looking at the %difference from 1.8 -> 2.8 :)|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Overclocking the CPU involves selecting higher voltages and timings in the BIOS to achieve higher performance (some motherboards alllow it, some don't)  It's a trial-and error process which voids your warranty and shortens the lifespan of your processor.  <br>  <br>  It's not particularly dangerous if you're careful, but not really "safe" because if you CAN burn out your CPU or damage your motherboard- especially if you're unfamiliar with the process.  Successful overclocking sometimes requires better cooling fans/heatsinks than the stock ones your system came with.<br>  <br>  You should read up on it and practice with an older computer before attempting it with hardware you actually care about.

7vh5fOeRaa	Well... you have a number of issues to think of other than the viruses, worms, and trojans...<br>  <br>  But, YES, you could move the processor without carrying the infections along with it.  The only part of the system that will truly be "infected" by a virus is the hard drive.  There are no permanently writable areas on the processor where a virus could hide and remain after the computer is powered down.  The processor needs power to do it's job.  Once you power a computer down, the processor is reset... there is nothing inside the processor that can maintain any kind of program or transfer an infection between machines.<br>  <br>  The problems I mentioned above have more to do with the processor itself.  You must make absolutely sure that the motherboard you are moving the processor to can support it!  If you move the 1.6 Ghz processor to a motherboard that is not capable of supporting the clock multiplier or bus speed, or if it uses a different socket type, then you will damage the processor.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend going to the website for your motherboard manufacturer and checking their CPU compatibility list to make sure you can drop that processor into the motherboard.<br>  <br>  As to the efficacy of the 1.6 Ghz processor... it's a bit dated, especially if it is a single core processor... so you'll be able to play older games like Halo, but don't expect fantastic frame rates or breakneck speeds.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Yes (From memory, halo is right around 1.0 requirement Maybe a little less, maybe a little more, but very close to 1.0)<br>  <br>  Just make sure the processor is the same socket type and compatible with the motherboard.|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	Yes, when a computer has a virus, the only thing that gets infected is the hard drive, unless you have a CMOS virus, but that wouldn't screw up your processor. A 1.6 Ghz processor should be okay for playing legacy games like Halo, but don't expect anything better than that.|`|rurjkXpDaa	Yeah that's no problem<br>  Remember every thing gets stored in you re hard drive, so the virus should be there.<br>  You could reformat you re pc and then it will be okay :D<br>  <br>  Use the recovery CD if you have one ..|`|I8TuOZMZaa	Yes the CPU is not effected by the above list. Most only effect the HDD.<br>  <br>  1.6 will be ok for playing halo at a low res but don't expect it to play any newer games to smoothly.

Myspace is very commercialized, which annoys me.  It does offer a variety of customization options to make your page unique.<br>  <br>  Facebook is superior in many ways due to the lack of advertising.  The creator only sells enough ads to pay his IP costs and some extra for income (last time I heard, he does well, but isn't going crazy).  Facebook is also nice in college if you want to search for people you know by name, location, etc.

cAnkWguTaa	When you copy anything, that is excatly what you get is a copy, You have to delete whatever you are copying after the copy has finished.  You will have to delete the pictures yourself off of the camera or the computer.  You will be able to still use them on your touch as long as you copied them to it.  Same goes for videos.  If you want to hide the pictures on the computer put them in a folder and name it something that you only know and encrypt it.  You can do this by right clicking on the folder click properties advanced and then check the box that says encrypt this folder. Hope this helps you

This will be the result that you need to print.<br>  <br>  The Python Tutorial at <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduc...</a> explains how to take pieces (called "slices") out of a string.  If you haven't already read that then it'd be a good idea.  And one of the great things about Python is that you don't just have to read about how to do it, you can test all of the examples yourself by typing them into python as you read the tutorial and getting instant results.  That's a really good way to learn.<br>  <br>  That should help you understand that the first N characters of a string named 's' are given by the expression 's[:N]' and the remaining characters at the end of the string are 's[N:].  It should also help you figure out that the last N characters of a string named 't' are 't[-N:]' and the remaining characters at the start of the string are 't[:-N]'.<br>  <br>  The tutorial doesn't explicitly tell you how to reverse a string.  It does show, in the table in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes....</a> section, the extended form of the slice expression that you can use to do this, but it doesn't go into details. Anyway, if you have a string named 'u' then the expression 'u[::-1]' produces the reverse of that string.  If you look at the definition of a slice specified with three values you should be able to see why that works.<br>  <br>  That's all of the information you need to know.  The python code that produces the intermediate string 'B', whose content is 'A' with its first N characters reversed, is:<br>  <br>  firstN = A[:N]<br>  B = firstN[::-1] + A[N:]<br>  <br>  (I'm using an extra variable named 'firstN' to make this easier to understand.  It could just be written as 'B = A[:N][::-1] + A[N:]' but that's harder to read.)<br>  <br>  I'll let you finish the problem.  If you follow that example and do it in two steps you'll create a variable named 'lastN' that consists of the last N characters of 'B' and then you'll construct a new string named, say 'result', that consists of the unmodified start of B followed by the reversed 'lastN'. And then you print 'result'.  That's it, done.

Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one.

The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a “high” chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory. <br>  <br>  It's good that your using Firefox as your primary Web browser, it's safer and better than Internet Explorer.

AA11318863	n the 1950s and early 1960s, prior to the widespread inter-networking that led to the Internet, most communication networks were limited in that they only allowed communications between the stations on the network. Some networks had gateways or bridges between them, but these bridges were often limited or built specifically for a single use. One prevalent computer networking method was based on the central mainframe method, simply allowing its terminals to be connected via long leased lines.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it; do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible. <br>  Even though this contradicts all my advice, not only does it <br>  terribly conflict with YouTube, clicking on "Don't Accelerate <br>  This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is "Although you can't even watch or access videos <br>  properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|FMJ9H0rjaa	It stuffs up when too many people are on it.

syC3uQpjaa	The answer depends on what you mean by the longest word, but regardless of your definition the longest word isn't superextraordinarísimo, the 22-letter word once listed in the famous recordbook and the word most often cited as the longest in the language. (It means "most superextraordinary.") <br>  <br>  The designation of superextraordinarísimo seems arbitrary at best. For one thing, the word isn't in real use. As of this writing, a Google search shows not a single instance where the word was used on a Spanish-language Web site — except on pages listing what they called the longest Spanish words. And superextraordinarísimo has two other strikes against it: If one is going to create words by adding prefixes and suffixes, one could just as well make a 27-letter word by using the adverbial form, superextraordinarísimamente. Or one could just as easily use longer root words, ending up with words such as superespectacularísimamente ("most superspectacularly"). But again they're hypothetical words rather than ones that get legitimate use. <br>  <br>  A better choice for a 22-letter word is esternocleidomastoideo, the name of a certain neck muscle. It can be found in Spanish-language medical texts. <br>  <br>  But we can do better without coining words. The longest words in real use appear to be two 23-letter beauties: anticonstitucionalmente ("unconstitutionally") and electroencefalografista ("electroencephalograph technician"). Since the latter is a noun, it can be made a 24-letter plural, electroencefalografistas, my designation as the longest legitimate Spanish word. And it indeed is a word in real use — not everyday use, but you can find it listed in some phone directories, for example.<br>  <br>  By coining cognates of some especially long English words, it would be possible to come up with longer words still. For example, some medical words and names of certain chemicals English top 30 letters, and the longest English word listed in an accepted dictionary is reported to be "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoko... a type of lung disease. A translation of the word to Spanish, which is made easy by the fact that all the roots have Spanish cognates, presumably would be neumonoultramicroscopicosiliciovolcancon... at 45 letters, or something similar. But such words would probably be considered spurious rather than legitimate Spanish.

Make a plan if it's a creative piece or have your camera ready for current events or reality filming. <br>  Before you want to film yourself/something else, you will want to have a good idea. Something that people will actually look at. <br>  Think about what the consumer wants; maybe making fun of something that happened the other day, or maybe you caught something truly amazing on tape, like an earthquake or something, or you can just inform people about a disease. The possibilities list is endless. <br>  Video the material you want to share. Make sure your voice isn't drowning out the subject's if you aren't self-filming. <br>  If you didn't shoot the footage yet, buy a video camera and work your concept you thought of before, out. If you already have the footage, Go to step 4, if not, get your camera. Read the manual, or if you already understand it, go and film your idea. When you are shooting the footage, make sure you are not shooting against light etc. Make sure you have enough lighting to capture clear images. <br>  As soon as you have your footage, connect your camera with a computer, and open the film in a program for movie editing; Windows Movie Maker is a good example for that, it's free and its on any Windows PC (if it's a legal copy), if you have Mac, there's plenty of other fish (free software) in the sea. Again, read the readme, implemented with your software package. If you want/need to adjust anything. Do it now. <br>  Remember, videos uploaded through YouTube's Single File Uploader have to be under 100MB. There is a 10-minute length limit for all videos. <br>  Optimise the video for YouTube. YouTube accepts a wide range of video file formats such as .WMV, .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG transferred from most digital cameras, camcorders, and cell phones. <br>  Consider converting if you have a source .wmv in high bitrate and larger resolution you may want to convert to MPEG4 at full resolution and then resizing to 320x240 using a high quality resizing algorithm - this can help reduce the number of artifacts you end up with. <br>  Verify your settings for easier YouTube uploading. YouTube recommend the following settings: <br>  MPEG4 (Divx, Xvid) format <br>  x480 resolution (* most updated recommendation) <br>  MP3 audio <br>  frames per second <br>  Resize your video to these specifications before uploading will help your videos look better on YouTube. <br>  Go to Youtube. If you do not have an account there yet, register one. The accounts are free. <br>  Upload your video, select the right keywords, so the people will find your video.

zId5dRS1aa	There's a few factors you need to find out first before looking for a graphics card.<br>  <br>  First off, if it's a laptop, it's rarely possible to upgrade. Some laptops that are configurable at purchase, like most dells, allow you to upgrade to the highest choice if you chose the lowest one first.<br>  <br>  Second, your graphics card isn't the only thing that will make games run faster. You need to make sure you have the right memory and processor requirements. Your memory is called RAM.<br>  <br>  Third, when choosing a graphics card, you need to check if you have an AGP slot available. If you do, you'll want to buy a card that's AGP-compatible. AGP is a dying breed however, as most boards are now using what's called PCI-Express.<br>  <br>  If you're unsure, generally you can pull off buying a regular PCI graphics card. Most stores with an electronics department will sell these. Keep in mind these are far from great, but it may be enough to get you playing the games you want.<br>  <br>  You basically need to do some research on what your computer currently has, and what it can be upgraded into.<br>  <br>  Installing it is easy, and generally you can be walked through by following the documentation included with the card.|`|fc90038589392ee116a71db9a461a8f9aa	Check out www.newegg.com, they have some of the best prices around.<br>  <br>  Before you buy, make sure to check if your computer's motherboard supports that type of interface. Most motherboards made in the last year will be some form of PCI express.|`|K6DWA6geaa	Here are some things to check first:<br>  <br>  1. Does your motherboard have an AGP slot or a PCIe slot?  AGP an older technology so your choices are going to be limited in that regard.<br>  <br>  2. Your power supply's wattage.  If you are going to get a new high powered video card, make sure you have the juice to back it up.  Check this site out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...</a><br>  <br>  It will help determine your power needs.<br>  <br>  3. If you have a AGP slot, I think your choice is the 7800GS (by nVidia).  If you have a PCIe slot, then it depends on your budget.  The 9800GTX is a nice mid range card at about $150.<br>  <br>  Installation is not that hard really.  Follow the instruction when you get the card.  If you have never opened your case before, you will probably want someone with you to show you the ropes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bfAr3Fj5aa	You can get them at any local computer store, and hundreds of stores online.  I recommend ATI Radeon.  Installing them is pretty straight forward.  Just put the CD in and put the card in when prompted.  Check the system requirements of the games you want to play and make sure the card you buy will be compat.

zorYTX59aa	YOU DO NOT NEED ANY DOWNLOADER. SOME PEOPLE ON YAHOO! ANSWERS <br>  ARE REALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE TRYING TO SUCKER YOU INTO BUYING <br>  THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE, which is really insulting since you<br>  cannot even access or watch videos.<br>  <br>  It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens<br>  and players that are blank or all black. Thus, I recently spent<br>  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of<br>  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to surmise<br>  is that there is no definitive solution out there. However, there<br>  was one interesting factor in nearly everything I saw:...Firefox.<br>  <br>  A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to<br>  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same<br>  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly<br>  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-<br>  computerese" that I would not dream of recommending those<br>  potential fixes.<br>  <br>  However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible<br>  solutions, so check these out:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a Mac and are using Firefox, apparently logging<br>  out of YouTube restores everything.<br>  <br>  2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:<br>  go to → Tools → Quick Preferences → Edit Site Preferences<br>  → Network tab → Browser Identification → Identify as Firefox.<br>  <br>  3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a<br>  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).<br>  <br>  4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet <br>  connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote <br>  that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left <br>  corner of their browser screen.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you. <br>  If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,<br>  please feel free to type any of these into Google's search box:<br>  -- youtube "blank screen"<br>  -- youtube "blank player"<br>  -- youtube "blank box"<br>  -- youtube "black screen"<br>  -- youtube "black player"<br>  -- youtube "black box"<br>  <br>  If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise<br>  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird: <br>  Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary <br>  Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has <br>  solved 100's of people's YouTube problems, so why not yours.<br>  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options > Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  The only other ideas I can think of are Flash and Google Web<br>  Accelerator. The most recent versions of Flash are frustrating<br>  lots of YouTubers. Updates are typically good for only 1 thing: <br>  software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the 5 different versions <br>  of version 10 (yes there are 5), you may want to consider this <br>  other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  As for GWA, if it's on your computer, dump it, burn it, trash it, <br>  disable it, uninstall it.

5IPZ7w2caa	Sure.  Just uninstall the newer version then install the older version of Office.  <br>  <br>  ..
FBQZ06vraa	First, a heads-up:  That Microsoft Office may be a trial version, good for 25 uses or 60 days.  When it expires, you'll be able to read and print your files, but not much more.<br>  <br>  Now for some help with Word 2007's new interface.  There is no way to set back the clock to Word 2003 or earlier, but here are some tips to help you make the adjustment:<br>  <br>  Most of what used to be under Tools->Options is now accessible this way:<br>  <br>  1. Click the round Office button in the upper-left corner of the window.<br>  2. Click the Word Options button.<br>  <br>  The ALT key, if pressed by itself, will bring up flags for some of the old ALT keysrokes that may help.<br>  <br>  Similarly, ALT/F goes to the Office button’s file menu.  At least some of the secondary keystrokes (ALT/F A for File->Save As, for instance), seem to still be there.<br>   <br>  Many of the old keyboard shortcuts (CTRL/A, CTRL/S, CTRL/O, for instance) still work.<br>  <br>  Most of the old dialog boxes are still there, often one level under the Ribbon's interface.  In particular, any group on a Ribbon tab that has a little arrow in the lower right corner leads to that old familiar dialog box when you click the arrow.<br>  <br>  Remember the right-click and use it.  It’s still the fastest way to Font and Paragraph.<br>  <br>  Sincerely hope that helps.|`|XlyLakYAaa	That new interface is called the "Ribbon" and takes some getting used to, but once you get used to it, it's WAY easier to use with lots more features than previous versions of Office.  Also note the "Office" button on the top left of the program.  You use that to save and open documents.  So if you're writing a document and you want to have font options, go to the Home Tab.  If you want to insert a chart or image, obviously the insert tab.  Etc etc etc.  Just play with it.  It's easy to learn and I find it superior to the old version.<br>  <br>  Also, there's no way to make it revert to the old version.

It can often cure the problem of lost connections after the removal of Adware components or improper uninstall of firewall applications or other tools that modify the XP network and Winsock settings. If you encounter connection problems after removing network related software, Adware or after registry clean-up; and all other ways fail, then give WinSock XP Fix a try. It can create a registry backup of your current settings, so it is fairly safe to use. I actually tested it on a test machine* that was having a Winsock problem due to some Adware removal, and after running the utility and rebooting, the connectivity was restored.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfix.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfi...</a><br>  <br>  Use Super Anti-Spyware To Remove Spyware,adware, malware, Trojans, dialers, worms, keyloggers, and hijackers.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.net/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

Microsoft is a SOFTWARE company. Apple is a HARDWARE company. It just throws in the operating system (which is based off of Unix, which they didn't make themselves). <br>  <br>  Don't believe me?

The Xbox and the Zune (I have both). <br>  <br>  Microsoft is primarily a software company and Apple is primarily a hardware company. It wouldn't make any sense for Microsoft to build it's own PC's. What they need to focus on now is rebuilding its once great reputation with Windows 7 and not receive the same result that Vista got.<br>  <br>  Plus, if Microsoft did build their own PC's like Apple does, they would lose a large chunk of users that build their own PC's (such as myself) who would all turn to Linux.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Nigerian scamers strike yet again...it seems to be a never ending saga with these thieves.  Take these steps:  Mail follows a certain 'protocol' and part of it is that when you get your mail from the server, it sends a 'message' back to the sender saying "mail delivered to a valid address" so the spammers know it & keep sending junk, plus spread your address to other spammers.    Merely 'deleting' from your mail viewing application will not stop this cycle, and 'block sender' fails because it's only blocks that specific sender...& once they discover your address, all they have to do is change a single character of the senders name, and they start getting their junk through again (depending on your filtering settings).        You want to end that notification, from the Server (your ISP) level.  Get a program that will 'preview' all mail while still on the server,  and 'bounce' the selected mail back to the spam sender ; in effect saying, 'This address is invalid' and they eventually stop sending junk. (Not instantly, but it's a start).    Try 'Mailwasher' Free, for 1 POP3 mail account. Upgradeable for multiple POP3's & web based mail.    http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/comm/f...

Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|eBcL7HCCaa	without software download updated every day hip hop<br>  hotnewhiphop.com<br>  hiphopearly.com

It will work on your computer it may just be slow to respond and the images created by may not be smooth. e.g. if you are using it for video messaging the 'video' may turn out to be a sequence of photos rather than a smooth video. <br>  If you are planning to use if for video I would recomend looking elsewhere...|`|tlEMsiHwaa	it will work but no that great.

Recommendations  Symantec Security Response encourages all users and administrators to adhere to the following basic security "best practices":    Turn off and remove unneeded services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical, such as an FTP server, telnet, and a Web server. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, blended threats have less avenues of attack and you have fewer services to maintain through patch updates.   If a blended threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.   Always keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services (for example, all Windows-based computers should have the current Service Pack installed.). Additionally, please apply any security updates that are mentioned in this writeup, in trusted Security Bulletins, or on vendor Web sites.   Enforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.   Configure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread viruses, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.   Isolate infected computers quickly to prevent further compromising your organization. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.   Train employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

qmWEGycFaa	An ISO is an image file. You need to burn the image to a cd in order to use it.    Once the image is burned to a cd you boot from it.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	It is not meant to on some versions. It is designed to boot from the cd and carry out the install. You need a complete file, if any required file is missing there is a 70% chance others will be also. You need to build the whole iso in one go before burning it to cd. I really think this is not a good idea anyway, the original installs of 98 had little support for usb, browsers which would not work correctly then, let alone now. Since there is no longer any update support for it (for at least 7 years now) you will find it very limited in use. You will also have great difficulty getting any hardware drivers.
