20090203100347AASwOnm	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Fishing	CA salmon fishing - follow up to prior question?	I wanted to clarify an answer I had provided previously on CA salmon fishing.      Salmon fishing throughout CA is NOT closed.  It is only closed in ocean waters as regulated by DFG and FGC.  Currently, you cannot target salmon in those waters.    Salmon fishing in anadromous rivers is NOT closed.  You can target salmom; however, you cannot keep salmon.  It is currently a "catch and release" only fishery.  In certain parts of the state rivers (ie. upper Sacramento, Klammath, etc.) take was allowed, under certain provisions and/or only during designated times.  DFG has urged people not to target salmon in these water ways - if too much targeting is witnessed, then DFG/FGC may push to have all fishing shut down in those systems.      Fishing for landlocked salmon is NOT closed.  (ie. Folsom Lake, CA)  Landlocked salmon fisheries are not closed, and do not have the same regulations and catch provisions as the other waters.      In the previous answer, I was only referring to salmon fishing in rivers - not the ocean.        Sorry for the confusion.  (I know my regs well, but I apparently didn't explain my answer well enough.....)

20090219192813AAIGUrK	Sports;Volleyball	Should i do it or not??	Volleyball tryouts were last monday and i did not make the team ( i am really surprised about that). Apparently, the coach prefer people who sucks at volleyball rather good people. She made this lame excuse, but she asked me, if i want to be a manager of the team (basically helping her out with certain stuff and training with the team, ) Should i accept this offer or not?       Here is the pros and cons:      Pro:   I will get community service hours for it.   I get to play volleyball for free.      Con:   I have to stay after school for 2 hours.   I cant play at games or tournaments.   I am dealing with bossy and stupid people (1/4 of the team)   I feel no pride in training with the team, and it will make me angry ever single time, if i see the volleyball team.      Should i accept this offer or not?

20090219152616AARdbyf	Sports;Baseball	Why Blyleven but not Tommy John?	Why all the hype for Blyleven but not John? John has one more win and a lot less losses for a far better career record. He was in twice as many all star games as Bly and has better post season stats. He has 2 second place finishes in Cy Young voting to Bly's 2 third place finishes. He has three 20-win seasons compared to Bly's one and of course was the guinea pig in the surgery that now bears his name. The only thing Bly has over him is strike outs.      People seem to think Bly played on only bad teams which is not the case, he played on far more good teams than bad and has 2 WS rings (to John's none). So the "he didn't play on good teams" line don't float. And he played on more good teams than John did - John just played for a couple famous teams which is why everyone seems to think his whole career was great teams.      So why does Blyleven get all the love but Tommy John doesn't (BTW, I am for both being in the Hall although John is now a vet committee decision).

20090219202130AA1uZST	Sports;Basketball	Magic/Rockets/Grizzlies Trade - I Do Not Get It?	The Grizzlies are the big losers cause they traded Kyle Lowry. The only promising PG they've got and are now stuck w/ Conley. But, their season has been over for quite some time now and at least they got expiring small contracts in Brian Cook and Adonal Foyle.      The Rockets lost out in by trading Skip, but Lowry is good and now Brooks who is having a breakout year can start. The Magic are winners in getting Skip, but I do not get it. I mean yes Jameer Nelson is out for the season. But, the playoffs have not been ruled out for him.      What if he comes back in the playoffs. Then what will the Magic do what the Cavaliers do and what the Jazz did and go with a 2 PG starting lineup. Where Alston would be PG and Nelson would be SG. Just, like Mo Williams and Delonte West do or what Deron Williams and Derek Fisher did? Wouldn't that be less minutes for Pietrus - who is playing well and also. I mean they got Anthony Johnson a clutch playoff player remember what he did against the Nets on Indiana and they also have Lue and Lee. They have a log jam at that position.

20090219202508AAcoTRt	Sports;Basketball	I'm excited about winter being over, so I can get back on the blacktop and play pick up basketball, and you?	Man, basketball is my sport and that's what I do all the time. I could've got a gym membership, and played b-ball during the winter but I was like...not this year. I said I could wait for the summer to play. Where I go every summer there's ALWAYS usually enough to run whole court for a full 5 on 5. When I get on the court a lot of people like to score as many points as possible, Me....I just want to win whether it be a steal, rebound, or pass, or a point. I like to contribute as much as I can when I'm on the basketball court, if I'm not the best offensive player when we play it's fine, It takes some pressure off of me offensively. I like to take the biggest player out of the pack when I pick a team, if I'm team captain. Anybody who knows basketball teams are always built around big men. Usually when there's a big man on our team, we almost always win. I basically try to be what the team is lacking. That's why some games I'm rebounding a lot, scoring a lot, or passing a lot. If we got scorers...I'm mostly passing to these guys instead of trying to score. It's all about playing smart mostly, not how hard you play. Plain and simple...I'm excited. However, I'll have to get there and park somewhere else because the University where I live loves to tow cars and give tickets. I need the exercise anyway....I'll jog or catch the bus and walk the rest of the way. The city is not going to stop me from balling at the spot. This is something I enjoy and nothing stops ballers...you know that! LOL Time to tell your ladies, wives, or whomever you want to call her, that you're heading to the court to play ball with the fellas and get your NBA on the blacktops this summer, I'm hyped and ready to hoop this summer and see if I can improve even more than last year. Peace! Are you excited as well?

America 1 Chivas 0      america has 2 points right now and chivas has -1 points...forcing them top go up front       America 1 Chivas 1   Both Teams Has 1 point a piece...      America 1 Chivas 2   America has 0 points and Chivas has 3...      this system forces the teams to play less mediocre football and keeps them on their heels....      this along with 1 tournament and a cup where the 1a teams could compete would make Mexican Football move up another level.

The Atlanta Thrashers are currently one of the worst teams in the league and this season is clearly not going to be a successful one.  Well, with the exception of Bryan Little who seems to be having quite a break out season.  Nevertheless, Don Waddell has put the "final straw on the camel's back" saying he won't trade Kovalchuk this year.  Is this a smart move by the Atlanta GM?  Kovalchuk will be a free agent at the end of next year and ATL could risk getting nothing in return for him.  Also, signing him to an extension is a possibility but thats never a given.  Furthermore, Kovalchuk says he's happy for the team he plays for and where he's at, but is he actually hurting his career by wanting to stay in Atlanta?  His goals, shots, and plus/minus are all taking a beating and probably won't get better as the season progresses.        1.  Is Atlanta doing the right thing keeping the face of their franchise?   2.  Is this hurting or helping Kovalchuk in any way?

20090203102749AAlgJ4h	Sports;Wrestling	Anyone else find it totally disrespectful to Bret Hart the way the WWE showed him in that WrestleMania 10 clip?	Yesterday, I just looked on in disgust when the WWE showed that WrestleMania 10 commercial. They showed Bret Hart and his brother, Owen Hart, (who died from falling off the top of an arena that the WWE's equipment team didn't set up properly) having a legendary match at WrestleMania. Then they decide to have the guy talking about it say something like how their match was overshadowed by HBK who stole the show. HBK, who we all know Bret Hart harbors negative feelings over. Why would the WWE do something like that? I mean, even to point out someone other than HBK and say there match was overshadowed would be disrespectful so this is twice as disrespectful to have it be HBK because they know that would annoy Bret Hart. I think there's a good chance Bret Hart, being a legend of the WWE, may turn on WWE television every now and then especially considering he's WWE Hall of Famer and forgave Vince McMahon. I bet he may be outraged at Vince if he sees that.

I am excited about RAW next week but...?	it could be a big disappointment as many of The Undertaker's matches have been lately. I mean, all I see him doing in his matches i throwing punches and that's all he does while on the offensive. Not to mention, he barely is on the offensive and usually is being dominated. Then Taker puts on the Hell's Gate for literally 2 seconds and he wins. I mean, if that is not disappointing then I don't know what is. Not to mention, he rarely fights on SmackDown and only shows up on ppvs so you'd expect a good performance when he actually does show! All I am saying is I don't know how excited we should be about him coming to RAW next week. Prepare not only for a DQ, but a poor performance from The Undertaker

Maybe it is time consuming and I won't have time for homework and projects. I go to a sort of religious school I guess you can call it on one night of the week and don't want to change that day if i would have practice on that day because i have friends who go on that day too. I am also in my school's chorus and we don't have concerts often but we have mainly two a year but this year we had three and i don't want to miss any of them. Practice to cheer is mandatory right and you can't skip it unless you have a really really you have to miss it reason. And I'm afraid it might take up too much of my time. I really think it would be so much fun to do this and that it would be a great experience. I've always wanted to cheer. If you are an allstar cheerleader and are in middle school how do you deal with this? Would it be too much work or are you fine? High school can answer too. (btw my week is not that busy it's pretty much one day i am not free)

20090219204136AARJhab	Sports;Basketball	How many people are STILL doubting the Celtics and Spurs, because of Kobe Bryant and Lebron James?	LOL...(Crickets chirping) Seriously, I know America loves the fact of another Jordan (a 6'6 to 6'8 slasher, scorer, dunker, jumpshot shooter that's exciting) to win games. The history books don't lie and Michael Jordan was an exception to the rule. Since the beginning.....Russell, Chamberlain, Abdul-Jabbar, Willis Reed, Olajuwon, O'Neal, Duncan, and Duncan and Robinson together.Garnett. Out of that list there was only one star player similiar to Jordan at that position that took them to a title and even he had help from Chamberlain at the time which was Elgin Baylor of the Lakers. My point is the star player of the team/team captain was the big man and that was the team that won the titles. Who's the star players MVP of their team? Duncan of the Spurs, and Garnett of the Celtics. I'm willing to put anything on the table that's who's going to win the title this year one of the two? History doesn't stop, except for Michael Jordan, that's why he's considered the greatest of all time, because he defied the stereotypical star position AND still won the championship and not as the big man. The big man star player in the 3peat era was BILL CARTWRIGHT! He was NOT a star player.Later he got Dennis Rodman, he was a role player but one of the leagues best rebounders all time, it was enough to win another 3 titles. However, the star of the team was still Michael Jordan. I don't think Lebron or Kobe can get that title, the only way is if Tim Duncan or Kevin Garnett get hurt. I know some people are going to say whatever to what I said, and I don't know what I'm talking about. Please, Please, write this down on a piece of paper and remember this question and statement. NO ONE WINS WITHOUT A STAR PLAYER BIG MAN. Andrew Bynum is not better than Duncan or Garnett, Wallace is not better than Duncan or Garnett either and until they get better than them. NO DICE! Dwight Howard has a better chance of winning, he's the big man with the big numbers and his team is talented enough AROUND him.

20090219204859AA94ays	Sports;Basketball	Why is Duke still in the top 10?	Look, I'll put this out there to stop. I hate Duke, hell, I hate UNC too. They both annoy me and i find lots of things to complain about them. However, I am always able to recognize when my complaints are just my hatred for them coming out in words to try to tear them down. And i've been able to recognize that ever since i've been a college basketball fan.       This year however, has been different. There are two things that I have noticed this season that have really pissed me off about ESPN and the sports media.      1) and the least of the two: UNC was heralded as being the best team ever and maybe the first to go undefeated since way back when. Ok, I get it..its media hype, it'll pass when they lose, right? Wrong...Even after losing to unranked Boston College AT HOME...ESPN still said "oh, they are the best team in the country" Even after losing at Wake...still the same thing. The reason this doesnt make me so mad any more is becuase now they recognize that UNC is beatable by a handful teams and may not be as good as, say, Oklahoma, Pitt, UConn, to name a few.      2. AND HERES THE BIG ONE: Duke is still in the top 10 after this stretch of pathetic play? I get it...ok...Duke is like the NY Yankees, USC in football, the Patriots, the Lakers, the Red Wings..blah blah..they are media darlings. But what do they have in common? With the exception of the Lakers...the above named teams have rarely won championships in the last Decade. Isn't time to get over it?      Anyway...on to my complaint:      In the last SEVEN games, Duke has lost FOUR effing times. And before the latest rankings came out, it was FOUR of SIX. Granted they lost to 3 top 10 teams but they lost by ALMOST 30 at Clemson, and got whooped at home by UNC. Their first loss in the stretch was by 2 points to Wake, which is understandable. But they have LOST FOUR OUT OF SEVEN games. And ALMOST lost to Miami (AT HOME!!!) and played piss poor tonight against St. Johns.      So, would somebody PLEASE explain to me WHY they are still in the top 10 and what it will take to drop them into the bottom 10 or even out of the top 25. If they lose to Wake on sunday, they will probably still be in the top 10...why? Because they beat St. John's. Is it just more, or is media bias in sports becoming UBER obvious over the last few years.      One last Complaint: When the new rankings come out monday...they will probably be:      1. Oklahoma (unless they lose to Texas on Sat)   2. North Carolina   3. Pittsburgh   4. Connecticut   5. Memphis      This makes me mad for 1 major reason: North Carolina has lost twice: Boston College (50 RPI) and Wake (16 RPI). Oklahoma has lost once, but it was to Arkansas(126 RPI). PITT has lost twice, also..but to two really good teams: Louisville (15 RPI) and 'Nova (10 RPI). If you take into consideration the fact that they lost those games AWAY and while major contributors on their team were sick and Blair fouled out, AND they are #1 in RPI...how can you NOT consider them the best team in the country?

I truly think the Eagles will win next year. Donovan McNabb will have the best year of his career but miss out on MVP to Tom Brady. Brian Westbrook will have a good year also. Brian Dawkins will stick around a bit longer and win Defensive Player of the year.      I also think the Raiders will get as far as they did because they have a decent Quarterback, two good Runningbacks, and a new coach who will call the right plays.      And the Cowboys will have meltdown next year. Tony Romo will have a 73.5 QB Rating, TO will be gone because he caused too much drama during the year, and Wade Phillips will get fired.

20090219204036AAf9IkB	Sports;Hockey	Is it possible to wear 2 jerseys as once?	Hey there, I'm a 17-year old kid from Toronto. Tommorow at school, I plan to wear a signed (Belak, Ponikarovsky, Tucker) Leafs jersey and then wear a Sundin Canucks jersey over it. Crazy idea but just to say, this is who Mats plays for, but underneath is where his heart is. It's funny but do you think it's plain dumb or should I go for it? And will it mess up the ink on the signatures?
