20090220220449AAWsec5	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fight this stupid careless driving ticket?	So, I was driving a friend home.. and I was on my way home in Oakland.. Which I'm not really 2 familiar with the area.. My friends were giving me directions.. Well, I had my left turn signal on turning left.. When, I made the left hand turn and a cop came out of no where and pulls me over.. I was like okay stopped.. and she was like do u kno what u did?? I was like no officer.. She said u cut me off and turned left from the center lane.. Which wasn't possible.. But, I didnt want to argue.. So, I just apologized and said im not familiar with the area.. She gave me a ticket for careless driving which is 110 dolars.. Plus I think 3 points on my license.. But, I later realized that if I turned from the center lane and she was behind me I could have never cut her off and I would have never of made that wide of a turn.. She would have had to be beside me if I cut her off.. and also I realized she messed up the street names and left 1 of them out.. Could the ticket be voided?? Any way I Can get out of this?? Please help..

I just bought my very first car :) Since I have some downtime now, I practice 4 hours a day on parking, turns, etc. He never took segments 1&2. And he flunked his written test. Me, on the other hand, have taken both segments and have held a temp. license. I am now practicing for my road test. I know too many girls that get run over when they let their boyfriends drive their cars.         I do not want to be one of those females. We live together, so this might be a bit difficult for me. I have stopped leaving my keys on the back of the door, so as not to tempt him to take off with my car when I am asleep. I have resorted to hiding my keys in my bag.      I really don't want him behind the wheel if he does not have basic knowledge of the road, signs, turn signals, etc.      It's sounds like a no brainer, but we live together, so that's why I am asking:)      Keep the answers relevant.

During emission testing, the OBD reported "not ready" for the catalytic converter and the evaporative system.  Could this be because the car was driven only a few miles after sitting for nearly a month?  Does it need to be driven more or repaired?

20090220200354AA8XAwZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	If you damage another car with your car door...? HELP!?	I was shopping the other day and it was very windy. When I opened my car door the wind caught it and it swung open hitting the car next to me causing a slight dent. There was someone in the other car but was sleeping, they did wake up (I'm assuming from the sound of the other car doors closing or the door hitting their car) but the person just seemed to be nosey not actually upset although I'm not sure, it was an older man. Anyways I was quite embarresed because I was with some other people and I didn't want to cause any confrintation so I just finished loading the groceries quickly, got in the car and left.        I was just wondering, can I be charged with anything for not assessing the situation properly? I'm guessing the would be to tell and them so they could file a claim or something? It was definitly not a major dent just a small one about an inch long and could probably have been buffed out.            Thanks        (I'm currently feeling really guilty :/ )

20090220225554AAG93oF	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	2005 PT Cruiser Convertible windows?	So, buying a convertible in Chicago was probably not the best idea I've ever had, but it was May, and I was missing the wind in my hair from my old Jeep Wrangler so badly...I gave in.        I've had the car for about 2 years now, and in the winter, the windows do this awful, terrible, anger-inducing thing: they stick to the soft top when it's icy so they won't roll down.  Now this wouldn't be that big of a problem except the window goes down about an inch when you open the door so it clears the soft top and then goes back up when you close it, sealing the window.        My questions are:   1.) I've been using de-icer spray, which kind of works.  The can says something about using it only on surfaces that won't be damaged by it.  Will it damage the paint on my car, the rubber window seals, or the fabric of the soft top?   2.)  If it will damage any of those, is there another solution to keep this from happening?      It is so freaking annoying when the window won't seal when it's 5 degrees and snowing, and on top of that, I'm afraid I'm going to break a window while closing it.  Please help!
