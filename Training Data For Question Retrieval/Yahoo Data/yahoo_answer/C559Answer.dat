euLtvSFraa	i've started trying to eat healthier lately too! gotta look good in the bikini for summer! haha.<br>  so to stop my cravings i cut out pictures of fit people from magazines and tape them onto my fridge and pantry to motivate me not to snack. <br>  it may sound crazy but its working so far.<br>  also, i tend to eat when im bored, and usually not when im hungry. for me its just a habitual thing, where im eating a bag of chips and before i know it theyre all gone. so now when im sitting infront of the tv, bored, i get a cup of ice chips and suck on those. it gives me something to eat and stops my boredom and there's no calories!<br>  hope this helps|`|aMBQLNGqaa	hey I love sweets too! I can have like cake and not eat a meal and still be happy and full! I don't eat a whole box of anything though I just have one - two pieces of chocolate or one think slice of cake to curb my craving...<br>  <br>  Sometimes if I'm like really craving for it I drink two glasses of water prior to eating the sweets then when I do eat the chocolate or cake I would be happy just by eating one piece and of course I eat it slowly and savor the flavour  :D|`|9wDVW6ntaa	well to start don't buy any snacks or sweets when u go to the store. second try not to think of it and when you cant help it just limit yourself to a tiny bit or just knit or read something to keep you off of it.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	only eat things that you make. that way you know what went into it and you can increase the health of the food you eat. and try getting a hobby it'll take your mind off of the cravings.|`|aVG3NpClaa	eat something else like watermelon or something healthier but  still tasty but you should give yourself a cheat day ones in a while so you dnt feel so eprive that you want to quit good luck|`|WWNuEV7baa	Write notes, physical reminders are great.

You will tend not to eat them if you have to go to the store first.<br>  <br>  Tell you friends/family to tell you not to if they see you going for it.<br>  <br>  If you eat fruit with natural sugers such as apples you craving be less intense.|`|nN8D64Yzaa	eat fruit and lots of it! you'll be shocked by how sweet it is and won't feel any desire to eat any more sugar. when you feel like whipping out the cookies and candy, eat an apple, orange, pineapple, whatever. those fruits are higher in fiber, so they'll keep you full for a bit. but if you still don't feel like your sweet tooth has been managed, have some berries. you could pretty much eat berries until you were sick of them, and not have eaten very many calories. <br>  <br>  if it's chocolate you need, try nutrition/protein bars like luna, clif bars, or z-bars. they come in chocolate varieties that are super sweet and taste just like a brownie or a snickers bar to me, but are much healthier. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|AA11311516	Thats called binge eating.<br>  <br>  You have to think that the sweets hate you! they want to make you fat.<br>  <br>  They are like a bitter ex boyfriend who is going around town saying bad things about you!<br>  <br>  Think about how many calories are in there and how much exercise you would have to do in order to burn it off.<br>  <br>  Binging is terrible.

o9p5kn1Baa	im at the gym for a good hour, i do 2 miles on the treadmill, alternating between walking and fast running, which takes me about 25 minutes. then i use the inner and outter thigh machines with 70 pounds, i actually can see a difference with firmness, and then some regular floor crunches. i would recommend running or using the elliptical machine to tone up your legs, it really makes them burn!|`|7swefA6Paa	i do 30 min on the bike and burn 300cal <br>  then i do stretches an core exercises/crunches/stability ball/etc for 30mn<br>  then weight room for few arm reps and leg stuff for 30min<br>  then i go on the elliptical for 30min and burn 350cal<br>  <br>  *oh and to the first girl who answered, i would not do more than 50lbs(according to my personal trainer) for a girl on the abducter and adducter machines because you will just get bulky muscles , but if you stay at 50 or below you will just tone your inner leg muscles.
i05dLLeRaa	You need to run for at least 40 minutes to get good fat burning results. Make sure you keep your heart rate in the fat burning zone, not the cardio zone. <br>  <br>  The "plank" is a great ab workout. If you can only do one, that is the one you should do. You need to work your lower and upper abs. make sure you work your lower ones first. <br>  <br>  Lower ab exercises work both the upper and lower abs. <br>  <br>  Upper ab exercises work just the upper abs. <br>  <br>  If you did the upper ab exercises first, when you got to the lower abs, the upper abs would give out before the lower ones really got a good workout.|`|ICfNkvIKaa	crunches arent really the best way to go abou it... if theres abb machines at the gym try those.. id start off by doing 100 ( it sounds liek a lot but do 2 sets of 50)   then run for 20 minutes and do 100 more on the machine.. then before you take a shower always do 100 more.. i hope this helps :)

DonrJcr6aa	it sounds like the progressive lenses you have are not properly fitted.  It Could be a matter of where they measured the bifocal height for.  Because a progressive lens has three focal areas to it, distance intermediate and reading it is critical to take very precise measurements to ensure the proper fitting height.  I wouldn't give up an trying a progressive.  Most people after wearing progressives have a harder time going into a lined bifocal the two major complains are that they miss that intermediate channel, used for seeing the computer monitor, the dashboard in the car, and also because you have a segment line when ever you see the bifocal line looking out Thu the distance it can create a jumpy effect.  There are some great progressive lenses  available. I would recommend a Varilux that lens will give you wider channels Thu the lens all progressives have some distortion.  Because they have to blend 3 focal points together the varilux compared to others like the nikon have a narrower channel causing more Peripheral distortion.  People wearing varilux don't seem to notice the distortion areas as much.  the anti reflective coatings can be added on just about any lens type.  the polycarb lenses will give you an impact resistance, that means the lenses won't shatter polycarb is also more lightweight than plastic.  If your out doors a lot you might like the photochromic lenses they are activated by uv rays and will darken when your out side.  they wont get as dark as sunglasses but they will eliminate the squinting and eye strain caused by the sun.  Varilux ipseo uses the newest manufacturing processes and is the latest and greatest in varilux. The lenses are basically customized to you past the point of any other molded lens. Fair warning because is is a pricey process to make the lenses they are more expensive than say a varilux comfort which should suit your needs much better than your current glasses do. I Hope that helps good luck|`|f88c8f0405e69beacff617362981bec8aa	greetings.. i worked for Eye Masters (also Vision Works, Vision World, Hour Eyes among a few others) for a while as an optician. EyeMasters doesn't sell Nikon lenses so i cannot comment directly on that. so, from what i recall most new progressive lense wearers grew to prefer progressives over lined bifocals but there would still be that 25% or so who just couldn't get used to them. half the time the reason was because the optician who measured where the progressive bifocal should begin set it too high or too low, or the lense in the frame style was just not big enough for the person to comfortably change focus between distance, intermediate and up close vision. everyone's comfort level with how much of an area they need to focus through the distance and the reading portion of the lense is of course different.<br>  <br>  if you haven't already, you can try adjusting the part of the frame that bends around your ear and/or the nose pieces to make your glasses sit just a hair lower on your nose. i definitely recommend taking it to a local eye shop to get that done however. nose pieces are tricky.. :) this should be a free service. <br>  <br>  i would not recommend upping the prescription simply because if you are comfortable with your prescription, it just isn't necessary to increase it.<br>  <br>  anti-glare can be added to any progressive lense, no worries there. <br>  <br>  as for which lense would be ideal for your situation, i can only recommend the best progressive lense available at your optical shop.  each eyeglass shop seems to carry their own variety of high quality polycarbonate progressive lense, unless you go to the very high end places.. regardless, if you went to Eye Masters i would definitely recommend the Eagle Vision Trivex progressives. <br>  <br>  and regardless of lined bifocal versus no-line, i think it's wise to own a pair of bifocals regardless of your issue with the progressives, just incase. <br>  <br>  the most important thing is to not be bogged down by all the lense types. i realize this is a sensitive sitaution but it's crucial that you use your judgement/intuition in finding an eyeglass shop with opticians who not only know their product but can compare it to product they do not carry. it'll save time if you can find an optician you trust. <br>  <br>  check out the link and scroll down a bit to the quality & specification comparisons of progressive lenses available.
C7FxHBwBaa	best bet is to make sure you're burning more calories that you're eating. however, chromium picolinate is said to help calm sugar cravings, green tea is said to boost your metabolism, and upping your protein is good for building muscle. and beware muscle weighs more than fat.

FyAHNpQbaa	well first, your body will go into starvation mode b/c it will think it's starving (which you are doing to yourself). it will hold on to your fat for as long as it can until it starts eating it. of course you will lose weight, but instead of looking healthy, alive and strong, you will look sick and weak. your skin will become more elastic (and trust me, you don't want that).<br>  <br>  you need to get educated about how to lose weight healthfully, without killing yourself in the process.<br>  eat at least 1200-1500 calories a day, and workout. it's simple. diet pills and "miracle strategies" don't work.<br>  go to sparkpeople.com to get a healthy mealplan to lose weight in a healthy way.|`|H2uAJoeMaa	Not sure if you're male or female, but for females, if they starve themselves they can start growing light coloured facial hair. Is that the look you're going for?
vYVu0rx5aa	your first mistake was using vaseline. the vaseline will pull ink out. i got my first real tatoo not too long ago and the person who did mine told me not to use anything with vaseline or high quantities of it. i was recommended to use aquaphore. its a really great thing to have and use for tats. if you got this done at an actual tattoo parlor they should have came with a one free touch up thing. so if so then you should be able to get it fixed after its all the way healed. just stop using the vaseline and use aquaphore. do not use triple antibiotic cream either. my sister has many many tats and she said that that does not do anyhting but make things worse. well good luck with your tat hope it all works out for you.|`|tSi10jneaa	Go to a doctor before it turns out to be an infection and becomes deadly|`|Dbr0MO3Vaa	you shouldn't be using vaseline, you should be using scent-free lotion and it should only stay covered for  the first 24 hours, and avoid exposing it to water or anything that rubs against it.<br>  If you are concerned go see your tattoo artist!|`|tekYuN6Saa	Relax. I had the same problem. your tattoo isn't gonna lose ink. once its in the skin it dosen't go anywhere. plus, it takes about a week and a half to two weeks to fully heal it. the best thing to do is to leave it alone (no matter how much it itches) and keep it moisturized. Eucerin or any other fragrance-free lotion would be your best bet. just give it some time. btw...vaseline is not a good idea as it restricts the flow of oxygen to the skin. just keep it clean and moisturized.          :)

It's a different experience for everyone, hopefully it wont turn out that way for u.|`|ajSQYvINaa	easy on the weed then if you keep on having these anxiety attacks.. and get yourself checked out..you might be able to prevent something serious if you see a doctor right away|`|x1qKGmzSaa	its prolly just the weed. it does that sometimes, ive heard.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Bv0v2nV0aa	You should be on medication to control these panic attacks.

Normally younger children get it and fever is usually a part of it and other symptoms. If you only have a sore throat and difficulty swallowing then most likely you just have a normal throat infection and it will go away on it's own and swallowing will not be painful anymore after a few days at the most.. everybody can get a sore throat...but mainly younger children get tonsilltis if you really had it before, Tonsillitis I mean, then maybe you should consult your doctor. Maybe your tonsils need to be removed, then it can never come back and you don't need your tonsils.

Heartburn will mostly stay centered and not travel, but gas will go into your shoulders when you lay down at times.

You probably had a slight injury that's causing sciatica now.  Inversion therapy sounds like it could be perfect for you.  Inversion therapy is when you hang upside down with gravity boots or on an inversion table and the weight of your body pulls your spine or elongates it so that your spine can straighten out and go back into alignment and straighten up.  This will also fix your posture problem.  Once you begin to invert your spine will get used to being straight and will stay that way after a while.  If you invert you can also do mini crunches to strengthen your spine and to build the muscles in your back.  Inversion therapy is the best thing for you sweetie.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.  Here is where you can get some good info.

AA11785060	Dude, only 12% of all guys are larger than 6.2 inches. So you are not "average.   There are really very very few guys out there sporting 8-9 inches, I'd bet most of the 12% over 6.2 inches in the world are 7 inches or less.  Just really rare for true 8 or 9 inch penis to exist.  Most urologists agree that a 9 incher is almost nonexistent.  So any girls claiming to desire giant penises are just full of it-- and I don't mean the penis.  They are BS'ing you dude.    You are more than adequate, and you should offer to show the girl making these claims that an "average" guy in her mind can blow her socks off. But in reality, she certainly is not worth the effort of having sex with.  Girls who are judgemental about guys' gear should be avoided.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't, and I don't think most girls do.<br>  <br>  These girls are probably immature, shallow and/or lying.<br>  <br>  Anything 9 inches long would just hurt a lot and wouldn't even fit for a normal girl, plus I don't go around measuring guys so I really don't know how big a guy is in inches! So possibly their estimations are wrong too and when they say 8-9 they are thinking 5-6!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	That's because they're still girls. We women are more mature and experienced. We've learned to adapt and enjoy whatever a man has to offer in that department. However, I will admit that the is a such thing as being too big, which makes things painful, and limits the positions and activities. The best I ever had was more in the 4" range.

The radiologist will contact the doctor immediately if there is a problem and they in turn should contact you. You need to call on Mon to see what is going on. If it is bad news don't get too uptight because xray's are a starting point and further testing will need to be done esp if it is a bone mass. A bone scan is more conclusive.

AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.|`|qiECo7l2aa	i lost 40m pounds in 1 month and a half by drinking alot of water and exercising 5 times a week at the gym  water is very important believe me|`|IUxM3brbaa	I'm pretty sure a diet is not something you're gonna want to eat.

Medical marijuana is very hard to acquire, and is almost impossible to get a script from a doctor for it (at least outside of California..and even there you can still be arrested for having it)

The usual loss of sensitivity is about 50-75%, and can be much more in some cases, depending on the damage.<br>  <br>  While foreskin restoration won't replace the thousands of nerve endings amputated with the foreskin, nor will it repair the damaged nerves and nerve endings on the penis, it does dekeratinize the glans and surrounding tissues.     I theorize that the dekeratinized nerve endings compensate for the amputated and damaged ones, which enhances the feeling and sensitivity of sex.<br>  <br>  Masturbation can provide more direct and intense stimulation than the walls of the vagina for a penis that's had the sensitvity reduced as a result of circumcision.<br>  <br>  That's why you can achieve orgasm with masturbation and not through normal sex.<br>  <br>  Restoring the foreskin isn't quick or easy, and takes several years to accomplish, but it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC
pzLDXL6gaa	Depends where you were on your cycle when you took it. If your period was due soon it could have just delayed it.

This is fact: if you crack your knuckles your bursting tiny bubble of fluid by moving the joints in a peculiar way, this is completely and utterly harmless.

LrGmpacOaa	You don't need to go after each partner - if you're using protection there's no need.<br>  <br>  But if you change partners 3 or 4 or more times a year, you should get tested every 6 months.<br>  <br>  When I had multiple partners I got tested regularly, and it's really not so bad. No one much cares about what you're doing. If you don't act weird, no one else will either. It's like any other waiting room when you go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Why would you care if you bump into someone. You're being responsible about your health. What's bad about that.<br>  <br>  Believe me, clinics take it seriously, and you can be sure the results are yours.|`|ldPd4mmSaa	how often you go depends  on your lifestyle, if your a complete ladies man and have a different partner weekly  and dont use protection then i would suggest going 4 times a yr,<br>  <br>  if your in a long term relationship then i would say go just before it starts getting serious .<br>  <br>  i've been a few times and only seen someone i knew once but they were more embarassed than i was but its generally a quiet atmosphere because most people there are in the same boat.<br>  <br>  you'll get your priliminary results  about an hour after you've been seen and after 2 weeks you will get a text stateing if you need to make a follow up appointment.|`|iFmMR2rOaa	Yes I have been to one, and yes I did bump into somebody I knew at my office lol. But we did not acknowledge each other.<br>  <br>  But they are not bad places - It is no different from waiting in an ordinary doctors or dentists waiting room. And the staff are really nice as well.<br>  <br>  You only need to go once every 6 months or so, and then only if you are having lots of sex with lots of different partners.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Yes you should go after each partner. Yes there is a waiting room like in an normal doctors. Yes its nerve racking but eveyone is there for the same reason so I wouldnt worry about it. If you meet someone you know just act cool and pretend you didnt see them. Their there for teh excat same reason as you, You normally get the results about two weeks later, They dont normally mix up peoples results in there.
iUzSlmSbaa	Camomile tea with honey helps.. and see the doctor on Monday.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	You may feel better by drinking hot/warm tea.  What works for me is usually regular tea (like liptons or bigelow) with some lemon or honey in it.  It will soothe your throat. Also try some strong cough drops like Halls cherry or Cloraseptic lozenges.  Perhaps one of these things will work for you.  I hope you feel better soon.  Take care.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Drink some warm tea, or maybe drink water+honey.|`|3qAtmbV6aa	drink warm milk

nolxYfzUaa	Wow!  You have alot going on there.  You may need something to go along with the prozac.  But, you need to heal on the inside as well.  You said you had a pretty bad life, find some type of forgiveness for the past and thus begins your healing process, and then maybe you can find a way to go forward.  Be real with yourself first.  That is the most important part of healing and being happy.  You can't change things, but you can make them better.|`|aWEybdDFaa	No one needs to fill your emptiness--that's your job.

If it smells unusual, is greenish/yellowish/brownish, or you find yourself having discomfort from it, you might want to speak with your mother or a nurse if you aren't comfortable talking to your mother. I do the same thing, but that's just how my body works. However, this can make you a little more prone to yeast infections, which if they go untreated, can cause some damage to you. Keep an eye on it and if it becomes itchy down there and you're experiencing colored discharge, talk to your doctor. Most likely the worst that will happen is some Monistat. :-)|`|GPvpBdlPaa	there is a condition known as leukorrehea, means excessive secretion... that could be normal or means you have infection - like yeast or fungal.. is the secretion yellow, green or white. is it itching or painful... try to observe when is the secretion more abundant, before or after period, before or after sex... is it a fishy smell... if it is really uncomfortable for you seek medical help... go see a gynecologist for help.
wMxJDXcRaa	Jen-Jen...honey...your question somehow leaves me speechless. Whenever did good hygienic habits make someone ill or easily prone to sickness? And then you ask if showering everyday is really necessary??? I SHOULD THINK SO! In fact, bathing or showering TWICE a day, is more acceptable, especially for females. Rest assured, youíll sleep much better...and this way, you will ALWAYS be in good (hygiene) health...|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	You do have a way of thinking now, don't you ? I won't "fire off" on you but ? showering without exfoliating the skin with a cloth isn't doing much good other than giving your skin a drink of hot water. You have to rub the skin in order to get the dead skin off, that's the rules.<br>       Whether you sleep 2 hrs. a night or not is up to you. I don't get much more than four hours a night if I'm lucky but that's because I'm disabled and the pain wakes me. If this has anything to do with illness I don't know but it's my guess your friends, if you have any, give you a wide berth at the kitchen table.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I doubt it, you were probably just lucky. Where I work a lot of people had the flu this year but I didn't, and nor did anyone else. You are just wasting water though- to start with you're not washing (I assume as you say you're not using soap), and you're spending a long time in the shower- you really only need like 3 or 4 minutes. What you're doing is just running the shower for 10 whole minutes when all you need (if you're really not washing) is a couple of minutes to wash your hair. Don't you think when there are people that walk miles every day to wells and springs to collect their day's water and then carry the water home, and when there are people who have no access to clean drinking water that you should be more conscientious with the water you use? And no, it's not essential to shower everyday but most people view showering every day as a part of basic hygiene, but then if you're not washing maybe the hygiene issue isn't important to you.

7PDD5NlAaa	Masturbate it is not wrong most people men and women do it. You don't need porn to do it either and it is free.
89fPJ2uvaa	Because you are a new walker, the itching is caused by sweat. After a week or so as you get used to walking, you'll find that the itching no longer occurs. Until then, I guess you'll have to put up with it, although I used to take a small hand towel with me and wiped the sweat from my legs and thighs. It did help a little. Enjoy your walks.

You will pee out the extra.<br>  <br>  26 oz of milk, even including your food, is no where close to a lot. Usually people that get a lot ( as in too much), are taking some sort of calcium supplement.

It happens from time to time. <br>  When a person develops an abscess on the gum of the tooth that has or hasn't been treated, typically they will not be in pain because the infection is draining out of that abscess. <br>  I like to tell patients if you're going to have an infection this is a good one to have. If he didn't have the abscess the infection would have no where to drain to, so the pressure would build up inside the tooth causing pain.  <br>  So, it's a good thing he has the appointment.

cplaV2KWaa	If per chance, you know someone with rabies and they are at that stage, say good-bye. Dementia is a latter symptom and if not treated at this stage, there is little hope. Some survive but with a very deleted body. By the way, reporting rabies is mandatory if suspected. Now to try to answer your question, animals bite when confused because it is their Natural defence. The are demented and irrational and behave defensively and scared. Any animal that doesn't recognize its surroundings will behave this way. A human can become irrational but will seem very disoriented, but generally won't bite unless restrained and that becomes his/her only defense. <br>  <br>  Another question arises and that is how a person contacted this affliction. There is a real danger that the human  got bitten or came in contact with an afflicted animals saliva. This animal must, I repeat, must be reported and stopped from infecting anything else. I hope this has been some help.|`|7lRqMK5qaa	I think that people who are infected with rabies have a classical signs and symptoms, but not all of these signs and symptoms can be seen in every case of Rabies infection.

ovPfkHSCaa	If you truly want to lose weight effectively and keep it off you must make a commitment to do so. This can be one of the fastest ways to lose weight and keep it off. Stopping and starting on diets and exercise can actually harm your chances. Many people who start with an eating plan and exercise regime and then quit only to start again in a few weeks often gain weight.<br>  <br>  more Info Here:-|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie if you are low in iron then you need to be eating more red meat at least 3-4 times a week.  More iron will give you more energy and stamina to keep going.  A common mistake that many people make is thinking that they can still eat anything as long as they exercise but sweetie, you need to cut out the soft drinks and sweets.  If you do want some chocolate every day then you need to go for the dark chocolate.  It is much healthier for you, of course you still need to take it in moderation! Ideal amount is one square daily. A block of chocolate should last a couple of weeks.  Your BMI sounds fine sweetie, what it may be that you need to do is actually tone up rather than loose weight.  Walking and running are good but can take it's toll on your ankles, hips, knees.  Running is worse and the jarring of hitting the ground is worse than walking.  Try swimming.  Swimming is a gentle exercise that actually exercises the whole body with no stress on joints.  Best strokes to do are freestyle (australian crawl) and breaststroke as they really work out your body.  At least 3 times a week and you will see results within a couple of weeks.  Just remember though sweetie, try and enjoy yourself when you do exercise, you don't want it to be a chore.  All the best and take care sweetie, already sounds like you are doing well though and remember that the best results do take time.|`|rzm1ZDovaa	well, maybe you haven't been doing it for enough time...<br>  another thing that might cause this problem is your diet. U need to eat 5 times a day ( YES, when on diet ) but making small meals that will give you enough energy. Because when u eat 2 times a day, your metabolism becomes weaker and whatever you eat turns straight to body fat. So eat more often, and you should see the results.<br>  P.S. Great exercises!

iUzSlmSbaa	Those are just coincidences. Your Trauma therapist did not give up work because of you. Just because dealing with so many people who suffer from disorders like yours, it's a big emotional challenge and it can wear someone out. She had lots of patients over many years, that did it, and not you. That's a very stressful job and she could not handle the job anymore. She had to deal with many many difficult situations over a period of many years, that wore her down and made her want to stop. Not you! Your Care workers broken foot really is a coincidence. Nothing to do with you at all.<br>  <br>  My parents get on a lot better since I left home. <br>  It is not your fault that you suffer from all those symptoms, so don't blame yourself and don't hate yourself. Probably your father always was easy to lose his temper and is looking for a scapegoat.. in this case your mother, whom he verbally abuses.<br>  <br>  Find another grief councellor or therapist. You need to work toward trying to get better. Starting off by not blaming yourself  and hating yourself for coincidences and circumstances beyond your control!<br>  <br>  Don't hate yourself. We are talking to you. I don't believe that I will be cursed with bad luck by talking to you.. you are a contact, if you need to talk ... you also can email me personally. I am not a trauma therapist, just an ordinary health care worker...I also happen to suffer from GAD.. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I went through a short period of depression several years ago which almost cost me my life, fortunately someone read the signs and dialled 911 and I got taken to hospital .. if I had not been found on time I don't know if I would be sitting here now, and I am glad that I am still here!'' but I understand about Depression and Anxiety..|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Not true my life has only gotten better since I have been your contact.

I'm really sorry you've had to cope with so many painful and difficult experiences. I can certainly understand why you feel anxious about any more bad things happening, but I'm sure you know deep down that there's no such thing as a "curse". You sound like a kind and sensitive person- do you really think you could bring anyone "bad luck"? Of COURSE not, sweetheart- this is real life, not some spooky movie.<br>  <br>  It must be hard to hold onto positive thoughts when you have so much to deal with in your life, but please try. Despite how things may seem right now, there's a lot of beauty and good in the world and life WILL get better for you if you can hold on and keep fighting.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can try to control these negative thoughts about "curses" and "luck" by reminding yourself that you're depressed and traumatized and not really thinking clearly at the moment. It's also very important that you find yourself a new therapist and keep getting your life back on track. Try to do some things to remind yourself that life can be good- spend time with friends, have a nice meal, go for a walk in a park, listen to some uplifting music, have a relaxing bath, or do whatever makes you feel a bit better. Be kind to yourself, ok? Take care, Teejay. Jenny

CnGR2xeoaa	Sounds like a bad cold or flu with a respiratory infection. But hey, I'm not a doctor so don't take my word for it. The lumps in the side of your throat are probably swollen lymph nodes, typical of an infection. If your nasal discharge, from your stuffed up nose, is yellow, green or darker color then it is probably bacterial. If it is bacterial antibiotics can be of help treating your infection. BTW- Lupus is a long term arthritic disease and doesn't usually appear overnight so I doubt this is your diagnosis. <br>  Tylenol is good for your fever, take lots of fluids, keep monitoring your temperature and if it goes above 102 see your doctor or go to the E.R.<br>  Again, I'm not a doctor as most of the people on here most likely aren't either. We are not qualified to make medical diagnosis so it is a good idea, if your symptoms persist, to see a real doctor.|`|nolxYfzUaa	Sounds like the flu.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Go to the doctors and find out.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	for this cough and cold you must be lucky enough to get the rare diseases you mentioned----  may be your delsym could not have helped your  to the extent of your anxiety also it may need some antibiotics for which your family doctor may be of much use
LriMdquJaa	This random occurance of nipple to no-nipple is completely normal, trust me. :-) Anything from simple clothing contact to a change in temperature will trigger it, and sometimes it seems like nothing will and suddenly you've got "headlights". Right now as you're going through puberty your breasts and nipples are going to be sensitive to everything they come in contact with, and they will probably be sore as well if they aren't already. There's not much you can do outside of wearing a padded or molded bra to help hide your nipples when they show. Until your body becomes more adjusted though, you'll just have to deal with it.|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	You are perfectly normal.

LxqM6j7jaa	When I was a medical student I had a neurology professor make all his students get an EMG. There are two phases to an EMG, one is the sensory and the other is the motor. The sensory will feel like little electric shocks not painful but not pleasant. The motor part doesn't hurt at all but your muscles will move slightly after each test. This test will tell your doctor a great deal about your nerves and muscles in your legs. Good luck and don't worry.

When I was 13, I stayed small basically from playing outside with my friends, riding my bike around the neighborhood.  If you have a dog, you could take the dog for a jog around your neighborhood, stay away from junk food! Goodluck|`|249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.

LPO8RlVdaa	Hi, Im a Nurse who works in the NHS.<br>  <br>  The NHS is free at the point of delivery. If you need hospital treatment you will get all the tests, x rays etc you need for free. Likewise if you see a GP or a Nurse at a health centre or walk in centre. <br>  <br>  If you are treated in hospital then any care given is free, if you are given a prescription by your GP for any lesser ailments you will have to pay for this.<br>  <br>  Most of the time you make an appointment to see a GP (usually the next day or 2 days is the norm). Or you can be seen quicker at A&E or a walk in centre. <br>  <br>  Mental health issues will be referred to by your GP or hospital if it is serious enough, the usual wait is a couple of months, maybe a little longer, but can be a lot sooner depending on the need.|`|24vZfnF3aa	in general, NHS care is free at the point of delivery. if you need to see your GP(doctor) you phone for an appointment, and will usually be seen within three days, sooner if you need to see a doctor more urgently. you do not need to pay, but if you are given a presciption for medication, you pay ￡7.10 (soon to increase to ￡7.20) for each item.<br>   if you are sent for further tests at a hospital, these are all free. all tests given will be seen as medically necessary, you don't get tested just because you would like a certain check or test, unless you pay privately.<br>   if you need emergency care such as in an A&E dept, or are admitted to hospital, your care and treatment are free. this includes meals, but you may have to pay to view a TV or pay parking charges.<br>    if you are not registered with a GP, or it is out of normal hours, and you need to see a doctor, most towns and cities provide a walk in centre. here you will usually be seen by a nurse, but an appointment to see a doctor can be made, if it is considered necessary.<br>   as for mental health issues, most towns and cities have an assessment centre for urgent cases, or you can be seen in and A&E dept, where further assessments or admission can be arranged. i don't know what kind of waits there are for routine care.<br>  hope that answers your concerns.|`|yjNRhUXGaa	The answer above is a good one!. My Fiance is also from Germany and we have to pay for prescription but it is only a small charge depending on your income situation for some cases. <br>  <br>  We get to see the doctor for free and the appointments are reasonable. We also have a help line with nurses constantly their to help on medical problems, which i find personally amazing if i have a question or problem with my health i call them and they answer my questions and give me what i need. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is also check out the NHS website and or call their lines for advice and information.

v9zA4YKxaa	I dont think anyone caught your meth part. Make sure  you brush your teeth and dont overdose moron. <br>  Taking drugs to loose weight is obsurd. Fry your brain becasue you like to party not cuz you are vein.<br>  Ok scratch that. get an education, didnt u have P.E. class in school?<br>  Dont eat before bed, watch your portions. Yes excersise a lot and watch what u eat. Have you seen fat people eat??? They slurp up pounds of fat in seconds literally. Eat normal but watch the fatty foods.<br>  coffee can help but can give u a heart attack.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	buy a skipping rope and burn off the fat|`|8U1aivfwaa	you will lose weight faster on meth than by  running in place at home.|`|q8m8wSTYaa	Google it.<br>  There's all sorts of crazy sh*t on Google.<br>  <br>  Or try Adderall [A.D.H.D. medication]. It's less harmful, won't make you look ugly as hell, and will make you lose weight. Also gives you an amazing high so I've been told, I'm actually prescribed to it, so I don't feel that. It's a better choice than Meth, Meth just makes you sit and do nothing like a vegetable, Adderall makes you hyper and able to do things and concentrate, and the best thing is you can eat before it, and not gain the weight, and you won't be hungry for the whole day.|`|AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.|`|AA11447210	That's "anyone", "really", and "right"....and there are a plethora of videos and DVDs available for home workouts. <br>  <br>  I assume you meant "method" of working out, and aren't seeking to learn how to make homemade drugs.

KeevlZnTaa	Have you tried combing them out and following their natural cycle? When I worked at a daycare a few years back everyone got head lice(kids and teachers included). I tried all the shampoos, etc and nothing worked, then I stumbled across a website that detailed how to get rid of lice naturally by following their laying and hatching schedule. It worked for me and other people who I recommended it to.<br>  <br>  Basically you comb the lice out for a few days, then wait for eggs to hatch and comb them out. It takes a month since lice eggs hatch every 30 days, so it assumes eggs were laid the day you begin. There is a bit more to it, certain days you have to brush while you get a day off of two on other days.<br>  <br>  Here is the site that has a natural way of getting rid of lice. It also explains why it works, etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/theliceprogram/theprogram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/thelicep...</a>|`|5135834c90cc2c12523172c90a0e1a7eaa	shave your head, or cut it extremely short. then burn all your sheets - or just wash them in really hot water.|`|V4jYQcJZaa	When I get lice I don't shower for three days, eat as messy as possible, then take a shower after brushing my hair. They're all dead by the end of the week.|`|6nrLRKmeaa	try to find out who keeps giving you head lice, you will want to treat the child's hair as well, because lice is highly contagious and even if you don't see them, they're probably there. <br>  <br>  you also have to vacuum everything, the couch, carpets, anything that's a cloth surface. It is a good idea to buy generic disinfectant spray (exactly the same as lysol, but cheaper) and spray every soft surface down and let it dry for at least a half hour. You might want to throw your pillow away, because they could be living in there, a new one is 4 bucks at wal mart, and the disinfectant spray is about 3 bucks there as well. <br>  <br>  my family went through a similar thing when I was in grade school, someone kept sending the kid to school that had headlice and I had it for about 6 months..it was terrible..I think if all that still doesn't work you can get some kind of carpet spray and stronger stuff for your hair from a doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  please answer  mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307024123AAw93jQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|BTI0XOptaa	The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical shampoos then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|M4Ij7Pqtaa	O.k...relax.  Yes, it's a pain in the butt, but you can get rid of it.  Without shaving your head!  <br>  <br>  When my daughter had this, and she had hair down to her butt and very thick too, we did get rid of if.  She was about 10 or 11, I put her in the tub, but you can just do this in the shower.  Anyways, those darn shampoo's are so expensive and they don't work.  So, I used cream rinse in the hair.  Apply tons of this.  BRUSH the hair with the cream rinse still in there.  Then take your lice comb through your entire hair.  Just small bits at a time.  Check the comb each time and rinse anything you find down the drain immediately.  With the cream rinse in the hair, it makes it very easy to do this.  Then, rinse and shampoo as usual.  Now, you need to spend at least 30 to 45 minutes in the shower doing this if you do a thouro job.  Do this every day to every other day for a couple of weeks and it should be gone.  Lots cheaper than buying all that crap that doesn't work and you'll have really clean hair.  Good luck.|`|ZoQwU2Juaa	awee! i'm so sorry to hear about this unfortunate predicament of yours. well, if it's been going on for about a year and nothing works, then in all honesty i believe that the best course of action is to cut your hair shorter to make it easier to get rid of them. and if worst comes to worst, then you could shave your head.... =\ i'm not being mean or making fun because my brother had it once. but it does make it easier. good luck!
FtBqmFDEaa	You need to go and see your GP for swabs, it may be something simple like thrush or a bacterial infection that is causing the discharge, you may need antibiotics. <br>  <br>  If the GP can't locate your strings they  may send you for a scan to see if it still in situ, ie in the correct position.|`|677bc72a53a3d69018bbcce7ac7bb384aa	yes, it could be the coil causing this.  I too lost the strings.  The doctor tried fishing for them to no avail.  I was then sent for a scan to see if it was still in the right place but they couldn't see it.  Next step was a hysteroscopy (where they put a small camera up through your cervix into your womb) They still could not see it and thought it was embedded in my cervix!!.  However after a day in hospital for a cervix scrape which turned up nothing and then an x-ray they discovered it had perforated (made a hole and gone through) my womb and was sitting in my bowel !!!  <br>  I then had another operation to remove it from my bowel which turned out to be quite a simple operation compared to what they thought it was going to be.<br>  <br>  Now I am not trying to scare you as this i have been told is very very unlikely to happen.  Unfortunately it happened to me, but<br>  <br>  Go see your GP and get it sorted out now.  The longer you leave it the more chance there is of it doing more harm.<br>  Hope all goes well ;)

It wouldn't hurt to have another test after 6 months, and honestly, if you have been exposed to HIV and think you might be positive, it's probably best that you not have sex with anyone else, don't you think?|`|xoymj33Taa	In all actuality, the chances of them somehow messing up the results of the Blood test are extremely low, especially if taken twice.

8GPAkkzBaa	I can't believe that someone with symptoms like this would be asking people on Yahoo if there could be something wrong. I also find it unbelievable that you would go for 3 weeks like this without getting it checked out. You need to go to your doctor ASAP and if you don't have a Doctor then go to the EMERGENCY ROOM. None of these things are normal, they are symptoms of an underlying problem and from the sound of it, not a very good one.|`|VjffE8fHaa	May need a cause of antibiotics to get rid of the thrush.May be could be more wrong with you besides the thrush.Go see your Doctor for a proper diagnosis..Get well quick.|`|aScgVDZ1aa	First, thrush is caused by yeast...think yeast infection of the vagina, in the mouth instead.  You need myconazole, or another anti-fungal to clear it (I have had radiation and get thrush infections due to low saliva...very painful)  Second, it sounds like you have a bacteremic infection - i.e., bacterial infection of the blood.  or this could be an underlying immune compromising disorder, such as RA (due to the joint pain) however, it is unlikely that this would be acute (just happening in the last three weeks)  However, most of these would require a visit to the doctor, the least of which is the thrush infection, which you can't treat it without prescription medication.  The best advice is to go to the doctor, get a normal round of blood tests - Complete red/white count, lymphocyte count, blood gases, bacterial differential.  This will determine if A., you white counts (i.e., the bacterial fighters) are within a normal range, and B whether or not it is a bacteremic infection...A good rule of thumb for infections is that if you can't afford medical treatment, wait a week, if it goes away great, if it doesn't go in.  (unless it is super severe, in which case go right away).  You shouldn't have waited 3 weeks for this!  Next time, don't go to Yahoo answers, go to a clinic!

Think about something that turns you on, a guy, a situation, then start rubbing your clit. I use the tip of my finger and start gently in circles. It can take a while to start feeling good. Just continue this till you start feeling real good then slowly insert one finger into your vagina. When you reach the point of horniness, your hands will know what to do.

Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.|`|AcupskMEaa	Weight loss programs such as me, usually involve slower dieting progress over a longer period of time, since such programs generally promise only 2-3 pounds of weight loss per week. Also, programs such as Jenny Craig usually involve buying special meals and/or dietary supplements during the initial phases of the program.? While some people may like these types of dietary programs, we prefer a dieting plan which focuses on faster weight loss, such as the Accelerated Fat Burning Program shown on link below

There is a simple blood test that can rule out a number of disorders.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|9ZCLZXZyaa	The only way I know of to increase a person's height is to break the legs and keep them stretched until they heal.

And do light weight lifting at a gym. For the back of your arms(tricep) dips, and tricep extentions are probably the simplest. As for your thighs you could do leg excercises: Leg extentions(quads), and squats. And for abs, the beginner things would probably be just situps or crunches. Maybe hold a dumbell to your chest and come up halfway on situps, which will concentrate more on the abs, when you go up all the way it starts to work the hip flexors.|`|xsYb3sReaa	You say your body is "jello" that means you need some strength/resistance training.

Increase your intake of cranberry juice and water!  I mean it.  3-4 liters a day you should be drinking to clean the urinary tract out along with any other toxins in your body.  <br>  <br>  Back pain is associated with UTI and is a sign of possible kidney stone that won't pass.  <br>  <br>  In the bathroom, WIPE FROM FRONT TO BACK!  UTI's come from the bacteria from your anus going up into the urinary tract.  Wiping in reverse does this.  You need to wipe from front to back. <br>  <br>  Also, sit up straight when you unrinate.  This insures that your bladder will empty completely, to prevent urinary retention.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Go get medical attention because your situation sounds like a kidney stone.

I don't believe the drug itself will cause you to gain weight. In an indirect way you could gain weight because you will begin to feel better once you've taken it for a while and in turn, since you feel better your appetite will improve.<br>  PS- Prozac will give you anxiety really bad for a few weeks, try to get through it.

I always think that 3 times a week in a gym makes a difference, so in this plan you're doing like 5 hours, so its just a little bit more than equivalent to 3 hours in a gym. Dancing for an hour sounds like fun, but what kind? If its just at home you could try one of those dancing workout dvds. I did a combat dvd for about 3 times a week, and i lost weight. At least by doing a dvd you would know you're also toning up also! Good luck and rememeber if ur just starting this take it slowly maybe only 2 1/2 or 3 hours the first week, and its also good to give ur muscles a break in between days sometimes cos u might get stiff and that puts you off training for like 2 days somtimes!! anyway im babbling on.....good luck and take care! x|`|oZODexjaaa	sure enough..You'd loose plenty of weight doing this :)<br>  This will be about 1-2 KG per week. <br>  but don't let yourself over exercise which might cause you weakness...<br>  Try making goals such as 1-2 Kg's per week and then head up if you like :D<br>  GOOD LUCK!!<br>              Loadsa love, EnJoYaBlE       ~GoOd girls~|`|BGRaT8jTaa	6 pounds per month...drink pleanty of water and increase your rotien intake like chicken and fish and you feel and look better doing it|`|HUbIzvf5aa	dont eat too much

The purpose of it is to protect the sensitive wound and to let the new skin to develop.<br>  So if you feel itchy, DON'T ITCH.. or you'll surely get scars, alright?..<br>  So when the wound completely heals you might find a little scar.

YayTJZltaa	Discuss with your teachers how to help lighten your load. They may be able to give you two sets of books, one to keep at home and one for school, or allow you to make copies of the pages you'll need to work on the next day.<br>  <br>  During the day, only carry what you need for each class to that class, storing everything else in a locker. If you don't have a locker, some schools don't have them for safety reasons, or if it's not practical to run to your locker between classes, ask your teachers if they can store your notebook/binder/textbook in their classroom (in a cabinet or their desk so it doesn't get lost) until the end of the day, grabbing it when you get into class.<br>  <br>  This might seem silly, but those rolling backpacks can really help, if you are allowed to use them at your school. Sure, you'll feel silly at first, and probably get silly looks, but if it makes you feel better, who cares.<br>  <br>  If at all possible, eliminating a backpack completely, just carrying a few things by hand, is really going to be your best option to be honest.<br>  <br>  It will help to see a chiropractor. Not only will they be able to adjust you back into alignment, but they can write you a note requesting modifications be made to help you out to prevent the injury from happening again.<br>  <br>  By the way, putting your backpack on only one shoulder is so much worse then having it on both....<br>  <br>  P.S. Seeing your primary care doctor won't give you a recommendation to see a chiropractor or a massage therapist, as a matter of fact a lot are totally against them (technically they can't even recommend them since they aren't "doctors" or specialist). A primary care will likely just tell you to 'take it easy', use some over the counter pain medication, and suggest you use some heat therapy. They might however write you a note to help you get the changes you need, but it really depends on how accepting of the idea that a child has back pain they are (many doctors are very quick to dismiss pain in minors since they don't think it can happen to them).|`|EOy0Dy7zaa	Oh! this happened to me!

Folic acid deficiency can cause birth defects (spina bifida). <br>  Some studies show folic acid may also  protect you from heart disease, stroke, colon & breast cancer.|`|AA10379545	Your doctor gave you the supplement because birth control pills tend to cause folic acid depletion in your body.  This can increase the risk of cervical dysplasia, among other things.  See <a href="http://www.diagnose-me.com/cond/C378603.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diagnose-me.com/cond/C378603....</a>  <br>  <br>  You should also know that all methods of hormonal birth control (including the Pill, the "mini-pill," the "patch," Depo-Provera, Implanon, emergency contraception, etc.) work in three ways:<br>  <br>  1.  By attempting to prevent ovulation (the release of an egg)<br>  2.  By thickening cervical mucus, which may prevent sperm from reaching the egg<br>  3.  By changing the lining of the womb to prevent a newly conceived human being from implanting in the womb, causing his or her death.<br>  <br>  The IUD also works by preventing the newly conceived child from implanting in the womb.  <br>  <br>  Some claim that hormonal birth control only "prevents pregnancy," but this is only because there has been a move to change the definition of the beginning of pregnancy from fertilization to implantation.  This is scientifically dishonest.  Even medical textbooks recognize that life begins at fertilization:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://abort73.com/HTML/I-A-1-medical.html" rel="nofollow">http://abort73.com/HTML/I-A-1-medical.ht...</a><br>  <br>  By the time implantation occurs, the child is already 5-9 days old.  <br>  <br>  For more information on this topic and information on the risks of various types of birth control, see:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.advocatesfortheinnocent.com/birthcontrolIVF.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.advocatesfortheinnocent.com/b...</a><br>  <br>  There are other options available that never cause abortions, such as condoms, spermicide, cervical caps, diaphragms, and Natural Family Planning.
db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	hmm...good question. All women are different. Yes, precum can get you pregnant.. and it's not 7 days, it's 3. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too worried about it. take a test next thursday and see what it says. repeat it a week after that too to be sure.. unless you start of course. <br>  <br>  When you're that close to start your period.. the lining of you uterus walls have already started to flush through.. being that close to starting, you've already ovulated and everything is flushing through even though your period hasn't dischaged yet... being that close... in some but rare cases, yes it happens.<br>  <br>  Yes the sperm still might be in you now, but typically not 7 days.. they usually die off.. in MOST cases!!! I'm not saying they will in your case, just MOST cases!|`|AA10363258	Yes there is always that chance but I doubt it.  You are probably fine hon, just relax.  Don't stress yourself out over it.

Your chances are slim and all i've ever been told is 3 days, not 7. Of course, sex always increases the risk substantially no matter if you are protected or not. I've had many scares myself, and the most helpful thing I did was be aware, but not scared. One of my PMS symptoms is worry, so whenever I get close to my period every situation gets worse. Just stay calm, be positive, but do understand that if your period does not come on thursday, wait a few days and take a pregnancy test. They are cheap and efficient. The hormones might not be strong enough to detect till a few days after the expected start of your period. So, for now, just don't worry about it. If you can't do that, go get a test done by the planned parenthood people near you. But like i said, don't stress out to the point of ruining your relationship or your life.

When you can't be identified any other way, they place your records (your fingerprints, DNA, dental records, any information about what happened to you) all together until they have some idea of whom you might be - then they run the records against a sample from the person they think you are.  For instance, they'll take your general description (and possibly a re-creation of what you may have looked like) and try to match it with missing persons records, or put the info out to the public.

Also cut down or preferably cut out caffeine as that will certainly speed up your heart.<br>  <br>  Try decaffeinated tea and coffee also soft drinks. I think you will find it will make a big difference.<br>  <br>  One last thought before I go is be sure you are taking your pulse correctly. <br>  <br>  Place the first two fingers of one hand on the inner side of the wrist on the thumb side of the other hand. NEVER try to take a pulse with your thumb as the thumb has a pulse of it's own and will make you have a false reading.

If a woman is diagnosed with certain strains of HPV, her doctor may suggest a biopsy of cervical tissue to check for signs of cancer. It is important to note that many women with HPV do not get cervical cancer, but HPV infection is an important risk factor for the disease. Further treatment varies widely depending on what your doctor learns from a colposcopy, DNA testing, and/or a biopsy of cervical tissue.<br>  To treat visible genital warts, there are several chemicals that can be directly applied. Some are prescribed for use at home, others may cause discomfort and must only be used under a doctor's supervision, and some may not be used during pregnancy. Genital warts also may be removed using cryotherapy (freezing), burned off with electrocauterization, or removed with surgery or lasers. In at least 30 percent of treated cases, the warts grow back again.

92VH41EZaa	It's said that your meant to sleep 8 hours every night to be healthy, however i think people vary. Some people can function fine on as little as 6 hours sleep a night others need around 10 hours. It depends on who you are, i'd say five is not really enough though but if you feel fine it should be okay, at least you catch up with it on sunday =)<br>  <br>  Sweet Dreams XD
M2XQMPNNaa	It would be unusual, but often children who have sleep apnea or other sleep disturbance will have daytime behavior disturbances such as ADHD. A hyperactive-behaving child will certainly not seem to be sleepy! A definitive diagnosis of sleep apnea is found through a sleep study, done in a medical sleep lab. The child will have many wires fitted on their scalp as well as monitors on the chest and upper lip. While it looks terrible, it isn't painful. If you suspect your child has sleep apnea it is imperative to confirm the diagnosis and treat the underlying cause. Children with chronically inflamed adenoids and/or tonsils often suffer from sleep apnea and removal of both will in most cases,eliminate the sleep apnea. The cycle of sleep apnea causes periods of cessation of or blocked breathing which sets off an alarm in the brain which sends a burst of adrenalin to rouse the sufferer, These cycles of sleep then rousing make it difficult or impossible to enter into the deep sleep that is necessary for restorative sleep, which can cause all sorts of difficulties such as pain syndromes and behavior problems to name a few. Ask your pediatrician for a referral for a sleep study. You can help prepare your child for the study by "practicing" what will happen once there. Attach some 20 different foot long pieces of yarn to a hat to resemble the probes and have him/her put it on at bedtime and then go about your normal bedtime routine. This will make the actual test seem much less intimidating. good luck.
rpRzeGN5aa	Yes, yes, yes. Everything you said basically fulfills the criterion for depression. These are the 'official' symptoms, though they vary (and keep in mind that, of course, you may not have all of them, but you can still have depression)--<br>  --Loss of interest in normal daily activities/things and people you used to enjoy<br>  --Difficulty making decisions<br>  --Feeling hopeless<br>  --Feeling sad or down<br>  --Trouble focusing or concentrating<br>  --Irritability/feeling easily annoyed<br>  --Restlesness<br>  --Feeling fatigued, weak, and/or in a daze<br>  --Feeling worthless<br>  --Thoughts of suicide<br>  <br>  And when I was depressed...I always wanted to be alone; I was terrified of the future; I was terrified of what others thought of me; I felt guilty a lot of the time; I didn't care about much, but at the same time I cared about everything; I was always afraid of disappointing people; and so on. <br>  I am 100% positive that you have depression. Many people who have depression are in denial, and they often have to reach a certain place--usually called 'rock bottom'--where they have this inkling that something is very, very wrong. And you have reached this place. And I can promise you that if you don't address this problem by talking to a doctor/therapist, it will only get worse. I'm sorry--I know that's hard to hear--but it's true. Depression is a chronic and life-threatening disease that must be dealt with like any other disease. Please see someone soon. I wish you the best of luck.|`|2Fdytg8Laa	It sounds like you have stepped out of your safety zone too many times.

It is best to go to a psychiatrist for medicine and a psychologist for talk therapy.  Psychiatrists are more likely to find the right medicine for you because they work with mental health medicines full time, while family physicians only work with them from time to time.<br>  <br>  I have had a lot of depression in my life.  Medicine and talk therapy can really help.  I hope you will pursue them, if needed.  If you aren't sure what to talk about, you can print out the tests and take them with you.|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	I remember a time when those symptoms were perfectly normal for a teenager. Now everyone thinks it's a mental disorder and all the world is medicated.<br>  <br>  You're 15...you have hormones in your body that will make you think you're a monster and if not, the rest of the world is a monster out to get you. You're going to cry...you're going to have low self esteem...you're going to have all of those symptoms you named and more because of the hormones playing tricks on your mind and body.<br>  <br>  Please consider that before going to the doctor and having them put you on medication that you dont need that might potentially screw you up for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  You sound normal to me...everyone goes through moments of depression. it's just recently that the psych industry has tried to force society to over medicate the children, teens and hysterical women. Dont play into that crap. You're okay. You're normal. Dont let some doctor (or even people on here) tell you that you're bipolar or some other crap like that....

zOZ23y7Naa	You have to find out why you have it in the first place and take care of it. Most people have orthopnea because they have fluid in their lungs. Fluid in the lungs is typically caused by heart problems, where the heart can't pump blood properly. There could be other reasons, such as airway collapse. For that you would need to be tested by a pulmonologist who may prescribe a BiPAP or CPAP machine for you to use at night. Orthopnea is not something to leave alone.|`|24aa155727dc6a3e63a543ad65785b58aa	it is better that you work on finding out what is the cause of your orthopnea first (if truly you have "orthopnea") by seeing a medical personnel.|`|zOVSKFMCaa	treatments:<br>      * Attention to airway, breathing, and circulation<br>  <br>      * Administer supplemental O2 as needed<br>      * CHF: Decrease preload by venodilation and afterload by arteriodilation and volume removal, to improve forward blood flow and decrease symptoms; give nitrates (sublingual/IV), loop diuretics, IV morphine, ACE inhibitors, digoxin, spironolactone; treat refractory respiratory distress with CPAP, BiPAP, or intubation<br>      <br>  * Valvular disease: Reduce blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor or β-blocker; surgery (balloon valvuloplasty, valve repair, or valve replacement) for severe disease<br>    <br>    * Pleural effusion: Treat underlying cause; thoracentesis may be indicated; pleurodesis for recurrent effusions<br>      <br>  * Asthma: Avoid triggers; bronchodilation with inhaled βagonists (e.g., albuterol) and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium); inhaled, oral, and/or IV steroids<br>   <br>     * COPD: Inhaled bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol, ipratropium); systemic corticosteroids; antibiotics in severe exacerbations; mechanical ventilation<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i could help

It is very often that we are "stuck" on medication that is not really right for us, just because our doctors would not admit they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Then there are allergies to common foods that we rarely think about - milk, eggs, gluten (in grain products) and on and on...<br>  <br>  The best bet would be to find a naturopath in your area, or some other holistic doctor (i.e doctor that looks at your WHOLE body, not just at the symptoms that have surfaced).<br>  <br>  Wishing you luck!

Are you having trouble staying awake during primetime sitcoms? Most of us know what it's like to be tired, especially when we have a cold, flu, or some other viral infection. But when you suffer from a constant lack of energy and ongoing fatigue, it may be time to check with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Fatigue is a lingering tiredness that is constant and limiting. With fatigue, you have unexplained, persistent, and relapsing exhaustion. It's similar to how you feel when you have the flu or have missed a lot of sleep. If you have chronic fatigue, you may wake in the morning feeling as though you've not slept. Or you may be unable to function at work or be productive at home. You may be too exhausted even to manage your daily affairs.<br>  <br>  In most cases, there's a reason for the fatigue. It might be allergic rhinitis, anemia, depression, fibromyalgia, or some other health condition. If that's the case, then the long-term outlook is good. WebMD looks at some of the most common causes of fatigue and how they are resolved.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis: Allergic rhinitis (allergies, hay fever)<br>  Symptoms: Fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, and drainage<br>  <br>  Allergic rhinitis is a common cause of chronic fatigue. But allergic rhinitis often can be easily treated and self-managed. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will assess your allergic rhinitis symptoms. The doctor will also determine through testing whether your allergies are triggered by pollens, insects (dust mites or cockroaches), animal dander, molds and mildew, weather changes, or something else.<br>  <br>  One way to reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis -- including fatigue -- is to take steps to avoid the offending allergen. In addition, proper medication can help with symptoms. Medications that might help include:<br>  <br>  non-drowsy oral antihistamines <br>  topical nasal antihistamines <br>  leukotriene modifiers <br>  mast cell stabilizers <br>  topical nasal steroids <br>  In severe cases of allergic rhinitis, your doctor may start by prescribing a brief course of corticosteroids to decrease inflammation. This medication is followed by the standard oral antihistamines and topical nasal sprays.<br>  <br>  Allergy shots -- immunotherapy -- may help in some cases. This treatment involves weekly shots of increasingly higher solutions of the offending allergens. Allergy shots take time to be effective and are usually administered over a period of three to five years.<br>  |`|eczikipzaa	I have the same problem, I don't eat the foods I should so I am sure that is one of my problems, but one thing that seems to help me is to drink a lot of water. If you are not drinking 8 to 10 large glasses of water a day, start doing that for two days and you may start to notice a big difference.<br>  <br>  Another thing that can make you feel tired is depression, I don't know if you are depressed, but many people are because of the financial situation we are in today. If you are feeling any depression over the economy, it's best not to think I am stuck and there is nothing I can do.

34tNnzQ7aa	Sorry to hear about your troubles, and I don't know how to help with that but here are ways to fall asleep:<br>  <br>  I have two things that work for me every time.Try tylenol PM (even half of one) because it helps you get to bed. Also, try counting down from 200. Your mind should be cleared by the time you get to 150 and you will drift off around 120. If that works and you continue, once you get used to the numbers 0-200, try starting at 300, then 400, etc. The more you recite them, the more you will become familiar with them and the more familiar you are with them, your mind will easily get distracted instead of counting/falling asleep. Both of those work for me every time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some other things I have heard that work for people me and others are:<br>  Maybe you're room is to cold or hot. I actually open my window at -2 outside just because I get hot easily<br>  Warm milk<br>  Listening to a fan<br>  Music on a low level<br>  relax every muscle (start with your toes. squeeze them for 5 or 10 seconds, then move onto the next muscle a little higher up, and continue until you finish your entire body or fall asleep)<br>  Try eating or drinking foods with tryptophan 30 minutes you go to bed. Tryptophans are a chemical that make the body sleepy. Don't eat a lot because when you fall asleep, your body will still be working digesting the food instead of sleeping. Foods that have tryptophans are bananas, turkey, milk (warm or cold) and more which can be easily looked up.<br>  <br>  Of course if nothing else helps and the lack of sleep is interfering with your work/school or quality of work, you can always contact your doctor or a local sleep specialist/center<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	I have the same problem!  Try not to think about her (however well that might work out for you....) or sing in your head......counting sheep does NOT work, in case you tried that...haha :)<br>  also try praying about it, and don't worry about not falling asleep or it will be even harder|`|ckeBvt23aa	try putting relaxing music on and then do what you can to empty your mind not just of her but of everything. I know it takes awhile but just try it. Also, hope everything works out with ya there.
yjNRhUXGaa	It could be, but trapped nerves tend to make your back crap up and you feel you cannot move or you get strong shooting pains. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is see a doctor who can check it out, or refer you to a back Specialist.<br>  <br>  The best thing is a nice relaxing massage if it is just common back problems.|`|2COaydcfaa	See GP it could be a number of things. I had a similar pain for months and it got worse. I am about to be scanned for Kidney stones.|`|jJwjJIekaa	Hi <br>  Sounds like it could be sciatica - a compressed nerve. ( are you getting pain in the leg or foot at the same time?)<br>  Try massage or a tens machine if it carries on go to the doctor and they may refer you to a physio.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I take the regular senna taplets regularly for cronic constipation caused by another medical problem.  If you took the regular ones without laxative, they might not work in the morning.  If they don't take two more with a warm liquid like coffee which makes them work quicker.  If you took the senna Plus with laxative, they will probably work in the morning and you will be okay.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|c4b40d3f07535b46185ffe5fc8c3613eaa	DUDE! you need to stay awake.<br>  If you OD'd on laxatives, you could choke on your own faeces in the night and wake up dead.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend sitting on the toilet until you have a bowel movement.
eT1Wqctpaa	Girl friend,<br>  <br>       I have never seen anybody who has asked more diet questions then you.  If you eat a healthy diet with fruit, veggies and some protein you will be in good shape.  I am wondering why you feel the need to loose so much weight.  I have lost eight pounds in the last month just by eating fruit and granola all day at work and a normal meal when I get home no snacking.  Each and every body is different so a diet will effect you differently than it would another person.  Just stay healthy and eat sensably and excersize daily and you will be ok.<br>  <br>  Uncle Rob|`|BPGAgmHDaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se to lose weight, the one method that clearly delivered for me was green tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I lost twenty pounds, it clearly does produce success!
3foSwZpWaa	Well I'd confront your friend and tell her you don't appreciate her telling anyone. And never, ever trust her with something important again. As you get older, you'll realize more about who your true friends are and who you don't need in your life. But I'd still be her friend for the time being, but certinaly don't trust her with anything like this again. <br>  As for the rumor, I'd ignore it honestly. In a few days, it should blow over if you just let it go. Some things aren't that important and not worth fighting about. Let this one slide and in a few days, the big rumor around school will be about someone else.|`|C51P9Wq2aa	that same thing happened to me about three weeks ago. but it was horrible because me and the guy were lab partners!! talk about akward, but you should talk to your friend and tell her about it and how it hurts you. if she denies it, then you shouldn't even be friends with "abby" in the first place. after awhile the boy will probally forget what you said and you will get to start your friendship all over again, which is a very easy thing to do.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Just stop playing all these rumor games,and admit to this guy,you do,in fact like him.|`|fArnxtvXaa	Well, firstly, I would take my friend to the side and tell her calmly that what she did was wrong and if she ever starts rumours about you again you wont hang with her. With the guy...hmm thats a hard one. Maybe itll pass and you guys could become friendly again. Or maybe you could pull him aside and say that your friend is spending rumours that are wrong about you.
8WbfmK5daa	You could possibly be Bipolar however bipolar is an extreme illness with phrases of Depression and Mania. Mania is far far more than just being happy. It may well be that you do suffer from bouts of mania and you just phrased it wrong with the word happy. However, angry is not a common symptom of bipolar.<br>  <br>  Im going to get all clinical and list some symptoms for you and you can see whether you feel you may suffer form them.<br>  <br>  Like I ve said, If you are bipolar you will have episodes of 'mania' and episodes of 'depression'.<br>  <br>  During episodes of mania the following symptoms will present themselves:<br>  <br>  Feeling unusually “high” and optimistic OR extremely irritable<br>  <br>  Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about one’s abilities or powers<br>  <br>  Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic<br>  <br>  Talking so rapidly that others can’t keep up<br>  <br>  Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next<br>  <br>  Highly distractible, unable to concentrate<br>  <br>  Impaired judgment and impulsiveness<br>  <br>  Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences<br>  <br>  Delusions and hallucinations (in severe cases)<br>  <br>  During episodes of depression you will feel:<br>  <br>  Feeling hopeless, sad, or empty<br>  <br>  Irritability<br>  <br>  Inability to experience pleasure<br>  <br>  Fatigue or loss of energy<br>  <br>  Physical and mental sluggishness<br>  <br>  Appetite or weight changes<br>  <br>  Sleep problems<br>  <br>  Concentration and memory problems<br>  <br>  Feelings of worthlessness or guilt<br>  <br>  Thoughts of death or suicide<br>  <br>  Taking into account what you said, but I am not a doctor, It seems to me you are suffering more from depression than Bi-polar. Angry is a common but often ignored symptom of depression, as well as rapid mood changes. It may well be that you have high DSM rating of depression.<br>  <br>  However, you should visit your doctor or Gp and they can give you a more accurate diagnosis and suggest treatments that may make you feel better :).|`|AyEkA6Flaa	While it is possible you might be bipolar, you also have tons of stress just being a gay teenager.  I'm guessing that you are not "out" at this time.  That being the case, the burden of keeping such a big secret -- and of not being able to date like other guys your age -- can drive you a little bit crazy.<br>  <br>  Before labeling yourself bipolar, I'd visit the school counselor and talk things out.  That will likely produce a lift in your spirits and some peace of mind that *someone* knows who you are -- and accepts you.<br>  <br>  You are an awesome, talented, handsome young human being, and you have feelings and needs.  Don't ever apologize for your writing, questions, or concerns.<br>  <br>  Hugs!|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I am not sure if it is bipolar or not - bipolar can be different in teens than adults. It does sound like something really serious, though, especially since your grades are slipping.  I think you should tell your mom or dad you are having problems and see a therapist. If you have been emotionally or sexually abused, that could be the problem, even if you don't think it is.  There are personality disorders it could be, or it could be major depression, but you are a teen, so maybe that is why you are all over the place.<br>  <br>  please do talk to mom or dad & have them take you to a therapist. If you don't make progress in therapy after a few months, perhaps it is a mental illness that needs medication.  If it turns out to be bipolar, that will require meds, in most cases.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|WNIL4sLiaa	I suggest letting your parents know this and see the family doctor and explain all this to him/her.<br>  If they feel it is something more then they will refer you.<br>  If it is bi polar there is medication you can take to help control your moods, just make sure if this is what it is you take them as prescribed and don't miss any.|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	Yeah, I think you might be bi-polar.<br>  <br>  :(<br>  <br>  I'm going through all of the same symptoms...and one of my friends who studies psychology says I'm bi-polar...and I think she is right.|`|E6SQA7f0aa	The best thing to so would be to talk to a psychologist.<br>  If you are about 17-18, it can sometimes start showing up then. But that is a tough time in life anyway, adn we don't learn very good coping mechanisms for jsut normal stress, so a lot of people getr a little nuts. Talk to someone. Even if it turns out you are bi-polar it's not such a huge deal if you are WILLING to do the work to MANAGE it. read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.mcmanweb.com/what_you_eat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcmanweb.com/what_you_eat.htm...</a>
tgIohzO6aa	Blood does turn brown when it is exposed to oxygen.<br>  It may be brown because it is your first period and it is "old" blood.<br>  Most likely next month you will have a normal period (red colored blood)<br>  Also, when you use pads make sure and change them often. <br>  Read the piece of paper that comes inside the package of pads and tampons with the warning about T.S.S. ( toxic shock syndrome)|`|UN8oh93qaa	You should try to talk to your mom about your first question. The fact that it hurts has nothing to do with your period. You could have a urinary tract infection, but don't worry. If that's the case, it's easy to take care of. Just bring it up with your mom to see if she can help. <br>  For your second question, the darker the blood is, the longer it's been in your body. At the beginning and end of your period, the blood may be brown as opposed to red. It's completely normal.<br>  Good Luck! =]|`|y4BJxPQwaa	how old are you? anyway when you go pee the pain is just because it's your first time and you aren't used to it yet.  and the brown blood is just old blood and blood after a while gets brown because if you get blood on a paper towel it will get old and turn brown.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|QJHE3z1raa	1.

Its fine<br>  <br>  and congrattts<3|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Brown means it's a very light period, but you should be prepared for the worst. Your periods will come very irregular for the first year or 2, so your next period might be EXTREMELY heavy. Have some heavy duty pads, overnight pads or tampons on hand.<br>  <br>  My 2nd period was really heavy, and my first one was very light.<br>  Just be prepared. :)
isnHOG0Waa	1. Talk! Don't hold all your feelings within! Discuss your stressful feelings with someone you trust who will listen without being judgmental or pressuring you to their own point of view. Even if you can't change the immediate situation, talking about it helps alleviate some of the tension you may be feeling. Supplement the verbalizing with something physical: write it out, exercise or hit a pillow. <br>  <br>  2. ACT! Be willing to take risk and make change, no matter how small. Try to change the stressful situation, or at least some part of it. Moving forward in small ways helps you feel empowered and in control. Put one foot in front of the other to move in a positive direction. Soon, the stress will lessen. <br>  <br>  3. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY! If you learn about how your body reacts to stress, you can also learn how to counter that stress. Learn to listen to your body's signals and find ways to reduce your stress, even if it's just "taking five" to clear your mind. Relaxation exercises (E.g. Yoga, meditation, physical exercise) help, too. <br>  <br>  4. BE IN CHARGE! Discover what you need to feel good about yourself and get your needs met. Another way to reduce your stress is to find an interest, hobby or activity where you feel in charge and call the shots. If you really feel out of control, don't stay silent and alone! Seek guidance from someone who is qualified to help you get through the obstacles, and move forward again. If you can't find someone qualified in your neighborhood or you don't feel as though you can talk to someone "in person" try a qualified internet counselor. If you would like to talk to ME (Advice Sister Alison) you can find information at <a href="http://www.advicesisters.net/getpersonaladvice3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.advicesisters.net/getpersonal...</a><br>  <br>  5. DON'T OVERWHELM YOURSELF: If you are stressed and overwhelmed, perhaps you are trying to handle too much. Rid yourself of extra duties that aren't necessary or important. Learn how to delegate and how to say "no" without feeling guilty. Ask for help if you need it. <br>  <br>  6. GET AWAY: Sometimes a change, however small, can do wonders for your spirit. Forget it all for a while--escape! Go somewhere new for a few hours, or a few days if you can afford to. If not, it may be helpful just to "get away" to a warm bath for a little while! A good article on how to create an easy spa experience at home is at: <a href="http://www.advicesisters.net/WWarchives/wwarcspa3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.advicesisters.net/WWarchives/...</a><br>  <br>  7. PRIORITIZE: You may not be able to avoid all the responsibilities obligations you currently have, but you can learn how to complete them without resentment and consciously choose how you will handle them. <br>  <br>  8. EXTEND YOURSELF: Make your own life better by making someone else's life better. Give of yourself. Volunteer! You will feel empowered, positive, important...and you will be! Visit <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.volunteermatch.com</a> and choose an organization you believe in!<br>  <br>  <br>  9. MAKE SUCCESS HAPPEN! If you can't change the world, change yourself! Learn how to love yourself as you are, while you work towards your goals. Then, make a commitment to yourself to start improving the things about yourself and your life that (you believe) need it. Instead of immediate, dramatic change, learn to enjoy the journey of lifelong self-improvement. You are always a work in progress.

SOCIALIZE: Spend time with family and friends for love and support. Don't be afraid to enjoy yourself! Appreciate friendship and let others know you care about them, too. Love may not conquer all, but it's a great start! <br>  <br>  11. LEARN HOW TO BE HAPPY: One thing all of life's winners have in common is a sense of well-being, a positive attitude and realistic goals. Focus on the good things about yourself, and in your life. Nobody's perfect. Learn to enjoy the "little things" that make you happy. Count your blessings. Every day, write down on a slip of paper one thing you are grateful for, even if it's just a sunny day, a friend's phone call, your cat's happy purr. Put this "blessing" in a jar along with a dollar or more. Do this for one month. At the end of the month read all those slips of paper and you will realize that life is better than you think! Use the money to do something really special for yourself, or donate it to charity.|`|jwOdHnzoaa	set goals for yourself. make yourself motivated. take time away from your friends and go to your teachers for help, this you MUST do. you are obviously doing something drastically wronng to be failing all of them. your teachers can help|`|jBipWFPaaa	8=====D(_|_)<br>  MMmmmmm that's hot
hc9deZ7aaa	Sounds like an anxiety problem. You need to develop ways of dealing with the stressful situations (doctor, physiologist can help) and get some soothing balm for your lips in the mean time|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	Sounds like you are experiencing deep pain or anxiety and compensating by creating a physical pain so someone will ask you if you are OK. You need to see your Dr and get referred to a Therapist if you cannot afford either I suggest you contact your local Women's center they often have free counseling regardless of your condition. I suspect you are holding in a secret and since you can't speak it you are literally "ripping your lips off". In the mean while you could apply a distasteful balm (utter balm or vaseline with a bitter additive) to your lips so when you bite them you get a nasty taste and stop. If you are too afraid to speak your secret write it down and give it to someone who loves you that you can trust. Good Luck!|`|moWEDZ2taa	sweetie, the best thing is to try to stop chewing your mouth apart!! i would suggest chewing on gum most of the time. If a tiny piece isn't going to keep you satisfied, then stuff more in your mouth. It seems the chewing is a habitual, so if you have something else in your mouth, you won't be prone to chewing your mouth. Make sure it's good, sugar free gum if you're going to be chewing it all day. If you don't want to use gum, stuff whatever else in there; crackers, grapes etc etc. Just snacks that will keep your mouth busy. <br>  Buy some extra healing chapstick or vaseline or petroleum jelly..or something!keep it on you at all times!<br>  If things get worse, contact your doctor!!!

Exactly, how much water are you drinking ?? Do you eat alot of fruits and veggies ?? <br>  I apologize for the questions but, they are intended for you to think if you have such symptoms.<br>  Perhaps, you are eating foods that are high in fiber ( fruits, veggies for  example) and, along with drinking too much water, this could cause your symptom(s).<br>  Then again, you may have an intestinal infection.This requires an antibiotic. I would recommend that you call your Doc's office and , speak to the Nurse to be certain that you do not have an infection. They may recommend that you bring a sample of stool to be tested.<br>  <br>  Have you tried taking an over-the-counter medication to reduce or stop the diarrhea ?

AA12266052	Hydrochlorothiazide, a 'water pill,' is used to treat high blood pressure and fluid retention caused by various conditions, including heart disease. It causes the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.<br>  Frequent urination should go away after you take hydrochlorothiazide for a few weeks. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:<br>      * muscle weakness<br>      * dizziness<br>      * cramps<br>      * thirst<br>      * stomach pain<br>      * nausea<br>      * vomiting<br>      * diarrhea<br>      * loss of appetite<br>      * headache<br>      * hair loss<br>  If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:<br>      * sore throat with fever<br>      * unusual bleeding or bruising<br>      * severe skin rash with peeling skin<br>      * difficulty breathing or swallowing<br>  Lisinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Lisinopril is also used to improve survival after a heart attack. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently.<br>  Epistaxis is nose bleeding. Bleeding can range from a trickle to a strong flow, and the consequences can range from a minor annoyance to life-threatening hemorrhage. Swallowed blood is a gastric irritant, so patients also may describe vomiting blood.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Hypertension is one of the most common causes of nosebleeds in people over 35. To better control hypertension, you should of course avoid salt in all forms, especially from processed foods, and eat foods that reduce blood pressure (those high in potassium).|`|Bv0v2nV0aa	Yes, yes it can. Although there are other serious cardiac conditions that can cause nose bleeds. If this is new, you might tell your doctor.

It puts holes in your brain.|`|AA10834046	MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine), most commonly known today by the street name ecstasy (often abbreviated E, X, or XTC), is a semisynthetic member of the amphetamine class [2] of psychoactive drugs, a subclass of the phenethylamines.[3].<br>  <br>  MDMA's experiential effects are more consistent than those produced by most psychedelics, and its euphoria appears to be distinct from most stimulants. It is also considered unusual for its tendency to produce a sense of intimacy with others and diminished feelings of fear and anxiety. These effects have led some to suggest it might have therapeutic benefits to some individuals. Before it was made a controlled substance, MDMA was used to aid psychotherapy, often couples therapy, the results of which are poorly documented. Studies have also recently been initiated to examine the therapeutic potential of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety associated with cancer.<br>  <br>  MDMA is criminalized in all countries in the world under a UN agreement,[4] and its possession, manufacture, or sale may result in criminal prosecution. MDMA is one of the most widely used illicit drugs in the world[5] and is taken in a variety of contexts far removed from its roots in psychotherapeutic settings. It is commonly associated with the rave culture and its related genres of music.<br>  <br>  There have been debates within science, health care, and drug policy circles about the risks of MDMA, specifically the possibility of neurotoxic damage to the central nervous system. Regulatory authorities in several locations around the world have approved studies administering MDMA to humans to examine either its therapeutic potential or, more commonly, its basic effects.[6]<br>  <br>  <br>  Effects of chronic use<br>  For more details on this topic, see Effects of MDMA on the human body.<br>  The long-term health effects of ecstasy use are generally not well-known, and the research that has been devoted to addressing the relevant issues thus far has been largely inconclusive. The primary concern is generally that there may be negative long-term consequences that result from the drug's alleged neurotoxic effects on serotonergic neurons.[32] Some further studies have also shown that this damage causes increased rates of depression and anxiety, even after quitting the drug.[33][34] In addition to this, some studies have indicated that MDMA may cause long-term memory[35] and cognition impairment.[36] Many factors, including total lifetime MDMA consumption, the duration of abstinence between uses, the environment of use, poly-drug use/abuse, quality of mental health, various lifestyle choices, and predispositions to develop clinical depression and other disorders may contribute to various possible health consequences. MDMA use has been occasionally associated with liver damage,[37] excessive wear of teeth,[38] and (very rarely) Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.[39]|`|8cWXhZGjaa	It's not nessicarily addictive but it is harmful, it increases the presence of free radicals in your brain cells which damage brain tissue, it also demylinates brain tissue, it damages your heart and it can cause impotence in the male reproductive system.

It is pretty sad when a small country like Cuba, with minimal resources at their disposal can give their citizens top notch health care for FREE and a "super power" like the United States ranks 37th in the world in terms of healthcare. Or how about the fact that rescue workers that worked tirelessly and selflessly at Ground Zero are dying from all kinds of respiratory problems and can't get health care from their own government but the terrorists that SUPPOSEDLY are responsible for 9/11 recieve round the clock state-of-the-art health care in Guantonamo Bay?  <br>  <br>  Anybody who opposes universal health care is either an idiot, or makes their living in the health care industry.|`|v6AFCH7uaa	It's unfortunate that people don't understand what Obama's health plan is really calling for. He is merely proposing to extend the health plan that all federal employees get to those who can't afford private plans. Considering my husband and I pay $900 per month for our PPO, it's a much needed solution for those people who can't afford it. I know how incredibly fortunate my husband and I are that we make enough to be able afford private health care options, but there are many struggling families in the US who work hard for their children and themselves and can't afford the astronomical price of health insurance. He is NOT planning to abolish private health plans.

We all strive to look the best and use hot looking guys as the pinnacle of man's greatness.  Who doesn't find Mathew McConaughy's torso hot?   Look at any group of guys-- always one or two really hot and usually athletic guys are the alpha males, and the others are followers who literally are attracted to their heroes. <br>  Sit down in a mall or any public place and people watch... Spot a really hot, attractive guy, and then look around at other guys. Most guys there will glance at the guy and many will hold the glance for several seconds or outright stare til he is out of sight.   Just normal human nature.  Why do girls put on makeup and wear all that smelly perfume and wear weird shoes and clothes?  Not for us guys, we don't really care and try not to laugh-- they do it for other girls' attention. Same with guys-- why do some guys work out so much and get all buff-- and do it at the gym spending loads of time with the guys.  They do it for the admiration they get from other guys. Just most guys would never admit they like being attractive to other guys or that really attractive guys turn a guy on.  That's not ok in our society.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	You want to jump on his bone?

i05dLLeRaa	You may be eating too little. <br>  <br>  If you do not eat enough your body goes into self preservation mode. It basically thinks its starving so it slows your metabolism and stores everything it can. Diets where you eat very little are counter productive. <br>  <br>  You are much better off eating 5 small meals a day and exercising. By eating more meals, your body will start to increase your metabolism. Run or walk first thing in the morning before you eat. <br>  <br>  Also, if you can, try some weight training. Adding weight training will speed up the fat burning. Keep in mind that weight is not everything. When you get in better shape and build some muscle, your weight may actually increase even though you look thinner and more tone. <br>  <br>  No sodas, white bread, sugar. Stick with 100 percent whole wheat.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You can have 5 lbs in water weight gain just in one day and expecially when you are a girl. This is normal. I can weigh myself in the morning before I eat and weigh a certain amount and then by the end of the day I have gained 2-5 pounds and wonder what in the heck, but it is all water. <br>  <br>  Are you exercising too? Muscle weighs more than fat so you may be gaining muscle. You have to expect that.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	your diets aren't working b/c you're starving yourself and then bingeing (i'm pretty sure i spelled that wrong). <br>  <br>  at 107 lbs you don't need to lose weight anyways. talk to a councelor, you have an eating disorder.|`|GMETk0BRaa	Dont starve yourself then binge, it makes your body store food until it gets feed next time.best thing is to eat 3 meals a day.

KAwYumFfaa	Have you taken any penicillins yet before? If not, you can take broad spectrum antibiotic Amoxycillin. If in terms of grade school, that medicine is in the first grade. You have to make sure though you take the medicine in the right time and duration. If you are well above 15yo, you can have 500mg Amoxycillin 3 times a day (8am, 1pm and 6pm) or after meals for around 5-7days. Make sure you finish the 5-7days or else the bacteria would develop resistance to penicillin and would require the higher order antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If you are not a fan of antibiotics. You can take vitamins. Vitamin C to be exact. You can take that twice a  day (8am & 6pm). Make sure you have meals before you take vitC or you might get an upset stomach.<br>  <br>  If you really are not into taking tablets and want something that would make your life easy, you can take some lozenges. There's a candy with vitamin C in it. If strepsils is available in there, try that one. Take em every 6hrs.<br>  <br>  You should also gargle every after meals. With your URTI, you can take something with antibiotic in it, check if bactidol is available. Then after your infection, just the regular gargle.<br>  <br>  Sigh...
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Whether to masturbate or not is a personal decision, but I think that most girls learn to do it during their teen years and sometimes continue during the entire life.  Learning to orgasm is a good way to teach your male partner what feels good and teaching him what to do to help you have a successful sexual relationship.  Some people even get help with cramps when masturbating during their period.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|7Yzgoowkaa	yup

Also i just tried weighwatchers recently and it really does work, u could try that, my friend was 11 stone also (i know this sounds like such a coincidence same weight, but she was).. anyway she joined in october and lost a stone by end of january...and she had like plenty of drinking sessions and kebabs thankyou very much lol so she prob could have done it sooner.<br>  10.2 doesnt sound skinny, but i was a size 10 then and looking back at holiday pics, i looked great! 9 and a half stone and i think u'd look too skinny, believe me. Keep some curves girl!!!! good luck and remember 11 stone at 5"7 still looks fab!
La9fanNbaa	Yes, you need to go to the doctor. In some cases the body will reject the IUD and begin to push it out. In really severe instances you uterus could have been punctured during insertion. I would go to the doctor to ensure everything is going properly and the IUD is still in place. <br>  I had my IUD inserted in December and insertion was nothing more than a brief cramp with minimal pain afterwords (nothing an advil couldn't cure). I have also never had children. I know many women do not have such a pleasant experience but your sounds worse than most. <br>  I hope you feel better!|`|LrGmpacOaa	You really need to ask them. No one here can really tell you that, even a doctor. It depends on why you're in pain.<br>  <br>  You need to be examined to make sure the IUD is in the right place and all that.

SRvCbAWlaa	The tubes that the blood are drawn in contain anti-coagulants to keep the blood liquid instead of clotting.  The amount of blood drawn for tests would never be enough help anyone, and the testing that is done is not the kinds of tests that would determine its safety. <br>  <br>  It is usually thrown away after several days.  Sometimes hospital labs keep the samples for a day or two to allow the Dr to decide whether he wants any additional testing to be done.

Then you won't be overweight anymore.|`|8udpbtOUaa	I dont think you will become anorexic, but you will get very unhealthy!<br>  Breakfast actually is the most important meal of the day, because if you dont eat breakfast, your body goes into survival mode and clings onto every single tiny piece of food you eat, making it harder for you to actually loose weight in the long run.<br>  Also, you would be alot better off to eat a bowl of vegetables than some pieces of cheese. Vegetables (excluding pototoes) are so incredibly good for you, that you can eat as much of them as you like and not gain weight. (The greener and leafier the better!)<br>  Then having pizza or chips for dinner? There are no good nutrients in either of these dishes, they are just carbs and fat. Especially since you eat the fries in the morning as well...you aren't getting any of the vitamins you need throughout the day.<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you would be...eat breakfast! even if you just start out with a piece of fruit every morning and then slowly work your way up to a bowl of cereal or toast or something. For snacks, eat cucumber slices instead of cheese. For dinner, try having a proper meal, try pasta and a salad.<br>  Also, drink lots of water! its good for you and it helps to fill you up.<br>  You will feel SO much better about yourself if you do this, and also you may find your weight a lot easier to manage.<br>  <br>  One more thing...if you are worried about becoming anorexic, the best thing to do is tell a parent or a friend that you trust, who can help you out and make sure you eat properly.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helped and that you get through this. Eating disorders are not fun and you jst feel so great once you're through it.|`|XZGUmCt4aa	no your still eating anorexic is when you dont eat|`|a2d5f09faa119f6c2350ba3f50dd69efaa	no... anorexic is if you don't eat at all...but yeah you should eat all three meals.|`|hNqy6bpLaa	well organise your eating habits so you become more confident of what you eat. breakfast you should eat even if its cereal or toast (Tea helps).|`|yb6ZlDPNaa	anorexia is when you restrict your diet each day. Ex, 200 calories a day or 400. There's probably 200 cals in that cheese you eat. Also, anorexia is fasting, eating nothing but water and ice cubes for a certain amount of days. Anorexics count calories like crazy and have wierd habits such as eating in front of the mirror naked. or arranging mini meals on tiny plates so their food will look more filling.

You might still have baby fat, or you might be overweight.  The important thing to remember is that you only have to like one person in the world, and that's you.  Don't get all depressed or upset because you have lovehandles.  Be grateful you have hair, skin, eyes, and are living life. 
a2dae7ade37f4e2ad8abc5ac78eff63aaa	Yes you can be overweight and have Crohn's. It's nothing to do with your size, as Crohn's is an auto-immune disease, where your immune system attacks random parts of your digestive system. I have it in both small & large intestines and my esophagus. I went from a 12 to a 10 when I was in pain and not eating but then I went upto a 16 with all of the steroids I had in hospital. Am now a 14 and coming back down slowly. <br>  <br>  If you are not happy with the diagnosis of IBS and think it might be somethig else, ask you doc to refer you to have a barium meal and a colonoscopy for a better diagnosis. :o)|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Crohn's doesn't depend on weight.<br>  Often what seems like IBS turns out to be Crohn's with time. Not fault of Dr., it's the natural evolution of things.|`|FYwc4pC1aa	depends|`|SRvCbAWlaa	Definitely, if your not happy with the diagnosis of IBS go to see a gastroenterologist.  I was diagnosed with IBS, but it turned out to be ulcerative colitis.  I had to change GI docs just to get the right diagnosis.  <br>  <br>  Crohn's disease will often cause children to be underweight, but in adults that isn't usually the case.
9e2a2d4a3c90f5a5a4934c64f1e04ac5aa	if he really doesnt want to eat and is small, my suggestion is to give him pediasure. It is a high in calories and has also got lots of nutrients. It is also sweet and kinda tastes like a milkshake. They give it to kids who have trouble gaining weight or are malnurished. While you are at it, NO MORE JUNK FOOD!!. He may not like it and he may not eat for a while. I guaruntee he will eat if he is hungry enough, but he will throw a fit at first and it will probalby go on for a while before he comes to realize that MOM is not going to put up with it. Right now he is throwing a fit because you give in to what he wants. If he continues to lose weight or refuses to eat then you will need to see a doctor. There may be an underlying medical problem. |`|BUOodnNRaa	From the symptoms you list, your son sounds as if he may be anemic. You must take him for blood work to see if he is anemic and if he is then he must have supplemental iron. <br>  <br>  A lack of appetite is one of the symptoms of anemia. |`|cSuJXYCjaa	Did his personality change after his MMR vaccine?<br>  That's when these kind of things usually happen.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Believe it or not upper cervical chiropractic can make a huge difference.

Why do you want him to be big? <br>  <br>   Make sure you offer plenty of different kinds of foods.  He should also be taking vitamins.  <br>  <br>  If he was anemic, why haven't you taken him back to the doctor?  He should be seeing a pediatrician regularly.  Malnutrition is no joke, it can affect his mind, body, longevity and future health. <br>  <br>   I would not try any natural remedy without consulting a pediatrician.  Juice at night is a good way to rot the teeth.  Give him water. Juice is high in calories for the little benefit it gives, fresh fruit is much better. Offer him lots of fresh fruit and fresh veggies.  Boiled eggs are good, and most kids like them.  <br>  <br>  There are recipes for treats, such as cookies and brownies that are nutritious.
gNM35w7Raa	Did your doctor do blood work? My son ran a fever for 9 days on the ninth day it broke, he had a virus as well, but my doctor ran some blood tests (cbc I believe) to make sure.  I know first hand that a fever lasting that long is crazy, I was going nuts that week thinking he had cancer or something because it just wouldnt break.  But, your doctor is right, a fever can last that long.  The important thing is to make sure they are hydrated and eat as much as they can to keep strength up, if you are still concerned ask for the bloodwork.  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  If you had the bloodwork, I wouldnt worry sure it will break soon!  Hang on till then!|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	Don't take my word for it (I'm not a doctor!) but I think that fevers can sometimes last for seven days or so.  Viruses can sometimes take a while to run their course.  You might want to call the doctor and ask him/her your question, or, if it's night where you live, call the after-hours answering service at your doctor's office.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	probably the flu, stay warm, eat soup and oranges.  hopefully the worst is over.  it drags on...

nF0Eaa2Gaa	Not unless you like dealing with having random outbreaks of bumps and sores on your lips and genitals. I think you know that herpes isn't a good thing. Maybe you're contemplating on having sex with some one who has herpes of some form. I hope you're in love because there's no cure for this virus. Also, It's possible to get herpes even while using a condom.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Yes getting herpes can be bad and very painful. If you do get herpes in the future....Plan on dealing with a lot of pain and out breaks of blisters or cuts on your genitals popping up at awkward times. Also be prepared for a possibly lonely future due to some rejection, not every one can deal with a person who has herpes. Plan on having a budget for medication or some kind of suppressive therapy regularly, that has side nasty affects but can suppress the virus. Plan on future partners getting very upset at you for passing herpes to them, if you end up getting herpes and don't tell them. Plan on friend and maybe family turning away from you because you have herpes. You can even plan on friends telling your future partners that you have herpes. You can also plan on having herpes for life since there is no cure for it.|`|dbbc96707652448861857d7e1a147af3aa	Yep its bad to get herpes. <br>  <br>  Genital herpes is a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease. Features of genital herpes include pain, itching and sores in your genital area.<br>  <br>  The cause of genital herpes is a strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV), which enters your body through small breaks in your skin or mucous membranes. Sexual contact is the primary way that the virus spreads.<br>  <br>  Genital herpes is common, affecting both men and women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the herpes simplex virus is present in as many as one in six teens and adults in the United States.<br>  <br>  There's no cure for this recurrent infection, which may cause embarrassment and emotional distress. Having genital herpes is no reason to avoid sex or give up on relationships though. If you or your partner is infected, you can manage the spread of HSV by taking steps to protect yourself and your partner.|`|giler9Wgaa	yes its very bad. one because you will never get rid of it. once you got it you have it for life. then you have to worrie about when a outbreak will happen. and when you have sex with someone you worrie about giving it to them. so i would say it is really bad.|`|ho0JgShXaa	geting gential herpes is bad do you want soars all over your genetials|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	one would think, yes.<br>  <br>  I've never had sex, though, so I wouldn't know.|`|L1RtyIVcaa	Hi!!!

jzbG6ZjQaa	It is true that until age 16, most doctors wont even attempt to seriously look for reasons contributing for your erratic bleeding history.  Brown  blood is usually a sign of old blood,which makes sense based on your explanation of your cycle not being regular.  However, you mention nothing about whether you are sexually active...I hope not.  A STD can effect your flow in addition to the obvious...Pregnancy. As long as you are not sexually active, and you don't have endless bleeding (which is a sign of anemia...low iron) I wouldn't worry. Your weight is also a factor that contributes to erratic cycles.  If you haven't gone through an enormous weight loss or gain that shouldn't be a cause.  Wait till you are 16, then if it still exists...demand that testing is done to determine a cause.  Hormone problems, and other cysts and tumors can effect bleeding...but give your body a few more months.<br>  <br>  Ask Mom or your guardian...as uncomfortable as it is, they know alot.|`|AA11809403	as i understand it, your athletics ( good for you!) are interfering with the hormones that regulate your period.<br>  <br>  You can't give up your period, and the idea of just plain giving up athletics sounds like punishment.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a diff OB/GYN would give you low level birth control pills to better regulate your periods.  but until something changes, i think your periods will stay very irregular.<br>  <br>  finding a OB/GYN who deals with female athletes sounds like the very best idea.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	Yes it is good reason. You are an athlete and this is the cross you bear. I don't think I would give up the sports, but maybe do some research and find an OB-GYN that deals with these sorts of issues.|`|waLWTi1caa	uhh instead of pass use tampons|`|z39egYCtaa	your period is the lining of you uterus shedding, and it can range in color from brown to red.i wouldn't worry too much about the color, AS LONG AS you don't have any stds (assuming... no, hoping as a mom since your not sexually active that you shouldn't have that problem.)  if you are concerned about your period being so heavy, talk to your doctor about getting an annual pap smear, or possibly going on birth control. this is NOT an excuse to have sex-protected or unprotected, but contraceptive pills regulate and can sometimes even lighten your unwelcome visitor! also, if you're worried about leakage, try tampons specifically ment for teens (i believe tampax and playtex both make them) and use a thin pantyliner to catch andthing else. make sure you're changing your tampon within 8 hours though, to reduce the risk of TSS

N3xdqu7laa	I'm not advocating, but you want to know, so here's one method:<br>  <br>  Drink approx. 1 cup of moderate strength coffee every 1 - 2 hours from when you first get tired to when you start getting quite paranoid.<br>  <br>  Watch T.V. or go on the internet, do something that requires little to no physical or mental effort but will keep your mind involved.<br>  <br>  Then, wait. When the paranoia starts settling, start on the coffee again. I advise you not to put too much sugar or milk in it as 1) the sugar will make you hyperactive and sort of counteract the spacing out affect of the coffee. and 2) they both will make you feel sick after 4 or 5 cups.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT:<br>  Don't stay awake for too long because it can cause brain damage, put serious strain on your heart and actually kinda makes you more depressed.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a phone nearby in case you freak out from the paranoia (trust me, it's overwhelming)<br>  <br>  Possibly write down some good numbers to call too, like hospitals, suicide hot-lines or emergency services.<br>  <br>  Don't attempt anything that requires concentration after about six hours of starting this regime, this is IMPORTANT!<br>  <br>  Also, be careful, this could be more than you bargained for because there is a very strong chance you'll hallucinate in a scary way, not in a pleasant way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, you'll need it.|`|TJUEaum0aa	Sleep deprivation should do the trick.

Take the damn thing out, it probably shouldn't feel too good.|`|50mwCZCcaa	It's because the bar is too long.  They need to pierce you with a longer bar, that way your tongue can swell up without the ball tearing through.  If the swelling has gone done, you can switch to a shorter length bar.<br>  <br>  Keep the same gauge.<br>  <br>  When I originally changed mine, I took the ball off of the top, pulled the bar out the bottom and followed the bar in through the top with the shorter length bar.<br>  <br>  If you mess it up..

IFL3GcM9aa	First, remember that Afrin is not the same as a nasal steroids.  Afrin is a decongestant, and it causes rebound congestion.  Nasal steroids such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase) work in a different way. While they also have some problems, they are not damaging the way over-the-counter nasal sprays are.<br>  <br>  There are several more natural ways to deal with sinus inflammation and congestion.  One is to flush the sinuses with a "neti pot" or sinus irrigator.  This will get the irritants out of your nose and allow you to breathe more freely. (See the source below for more info.)<br>  <br>  One other thing that may help is to feed the cats a higher quality of catfood.  I had a friend that discovered this when her cat had food allergies.  When she got the allergens out of her cat's food, her own allergies got a lot better.  Her theory is that the cat was exuding the allergens in its dandruff and fur.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Do not take two different antihistamines. It does more damage then good. Do not use the medicated nasal sprays for more then a couple of days. They can really mess you up. There are saline solutions you can use on a regular bases and they do help. There is also saline gels you can use. Flush your sinuses before you go to bed and after you wake up.
DmXfeGMKaa	The dentist can make you a mouth guard to prevent you from doing any more damage.|`|xhijqoBwaa	This is quite a common condition, and if it's not curbed you could grind your teeth smooth over the next few years.  The problem is easily solved by a visit to your dentist.  They will give you a mouth guard to sleep in.  It's a little uncomfortable at first, but you'll get used to it quite quickly, and it'll stop the toothache.
JTSwonTTaa	I get this so much. It's just nerves twitching. Nothing to be worried about medically. Are you stressed a lot like me too? Sometimes my eye muscle will twitch, It is kinda annoying but oh well.|`|nolxYfzUaa	You could be experiencing leg cramp due to low potassium.  Home remedy< take 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar each day.  Works.  Then again you could be developing dvt, which is a blood clot.  Is it hot to touch?  Talk to your doctor about it if this should continue.  If this is what your doctor suspects, he will order a doppler to be done.  Good luck.

M2XQMPNNaa	the most important step in helping you to feel better is to establish a better, consistent sleep pattern. There are many studies conducted that prove that poor sleep &/or lack of sleep can cause cycles of pain and depression. Have you ever tried melatonin? There are supplements as well that can help with sleep. Magnesium can be helpful. If natural supplements don't work for you then it is time to ask your physician for help. a short term prescription for sleeping pills can help you to begin an improved sleep cycle. Once you have 2 weeks of good sleep, you may find the magnesium &/or melatonin effective. If after 2 weeks of sleep you are still experiencing anxiety and depression, then you need to address that with a combination of medication and counseling. Don't keep riding this hellish roller coaster and hoping things get better.

bTXsr5JWaa	are you sure it's not broken? i've had several ankle and foot injuries, but none like this.<br>  i do really feel for you, as i've cried from the pain. if it doesn't progress within the next week, nag your parents and doctors so that you can have an x-ray. you may have even ripped the ligaments. x|`|F32uPjAraa	Did they take an x-ray?

92VH41EZaa	I'd say you have an eye infection. Or you could have just strained them. For now, give them a rest and i wouldn't look at any screens (tv, computer) as that would make it worse. If the pain continues go to see a doctor who'd examine them and give you some eye drops or he might refer you to an opticians. <br>  <br>  You could always try and cry - this is the body's natural cleaning system for the eyes so any harmful bacteria or debri causing your eyes to hurt could be washed away which would ease the pain.<br>  <br>  hope your feeling better soon =)|`|kTDobubBaa	Well i am not sure.<br>  <br>  You could be really tired, or your allergies. (if you have them) or it could be a eye infection. And sometime when your eyes hurt that is a headache. Take some headache medicene and see if that helps. I would also go to the doctor if it doesn't go away in the next day or two.

Exercise your body with a continously program.|`|AA11447210	You need to consume over 1200 calories a day to keep your body running properly and to keep your metabolism from slowing down (which causes quick weight gain and slower weight loss).<br>  <br>  You need to be eating lean protein, fruits and veggies, healthy fats, whole grain products, and drinking plenty of water. You aren't on much of a weight loss program if you are going out drinking...that should be something you drop until you hit your goal, and then add back only in moderation (eating virtually nothing all day so you can drink all night isn't an effective weight loss plan).<br>  <br>  Eat the bar...drink club soda tonight.

dgKLiAN1aa	I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Just recovered from a very similar problem, had somehow pulled a muscle connecting the arm to my neck which hurt for about a week but it has become normal again now.<br>  <br>  You've proberbly just damaged your muscle a bit. It will hurt when you use it for the next few days (maybe a week) but it shouldn't be anything too bad. If the pain is (or develops) to be a really sharp pain you should get it checked out however.<br>  <br>  If it is a trapped nerve there isn't really anything you can do to correct it. It will sort itself out over time though. However you could try some gentle exercises (just moving your arm about a bit) to try and see if that helps.<br>  <br>  Overall if its a dull pain don't worry about it, it'll most likely be gone in a week (if not goto the doctor). If its a sharp pain goto the doctor just to be safe.|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	Hi!

iUzSlmSbaa	Any physical activity is good for weight loss.. Definitely skating is good, as well as swimming, (I love swimming, because I don't like to sweat). Skating is not bad. In Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, we have the biggest natural skating rink in the world.. but as the weather has warmed up a little for Canadian Standards, Friday was the last possible day for this winter to skate on the Canal. The closed it down now as it's too dangerous with the temperatures getting warmer. Indoor skating rinks are better because the ice is smoother but there is not as much room and it's free of charge here.<br>  <br>  I have to run on the treadmill. 30 mins of fast walking and a little bit of jogging just loses me 150 calories...I do that 7 times a week. Skating for a couple of hours will help, as well as going for brisk walks,<br>  <br>  Different activities and how many calories they burn... <br>  <a href="http://www.eddieoneverything.com/sports/how-many-calories-does-activity-x-burn.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eddieoneverything.com/sports/...</a><br>  <br>  it says one burns on average 450 calories for one hour of ice skating.. that's not bad... I only burn about 340 cals for one entire hour on the treadmill.

Demanding a constant balance in your body while skating strengthens your stomach muscles much more then walking but doesn't target anywhere else in your body.<br>  <br>  To sum it up, skating will help you lose that belly, but if you want your entire body to lose fat, try walking or bike riding.|`|qlDe6N6gaa	Itll sure keep you in shape i can tell ya that much.|`|UDzG3guEaa	not sure, but it sure is fun XD<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|aMBQLNGqaa	it will help you in your weight loss|`|AptDOfFPaa	Slowley....

pqqKLCmwaa	Eating cold water fish is prob the best,but the pills are cheaper,and have fewer calories. I do both. Fish oil pills bother my stomach ,so I take them with a meal . Lately, I have been taking flax seed oil,as it is easier on the stomach. It is still Omega 3. I eat salmon once a week,usually.<br>  Benefits:<br>  Lower cholesterol<br>  Possible lower blood pressure<br>  Lower levels of inflamation, which is helpful for a lot of conditions like arthritis,alzheimer's, atherosclerosis<br>  Inhibits blood clot formation<br>  Good for the heart.<br>  <br>  Make sure any oils are as fresh as possible . Look for "cold processed" oils,and check expiration dates. Avoid obscure brands.|`|WdcF8DpXaa	I am not a big fan of pills if you just eat a balanced meal you will be fine.

yBgRDe9Vaa	Gargle warm salt water every 4 hours for a day or two and see if that helps.  May be Spring allergies coming out causing raw throat/cough.  Benedril before bed will help if it's allergies, but not during the day...makes you sleepy/groggy.  Zinc lozenges or Fisherman's Friends lozenges might help.  Trust me, I'm a singer...been there/done that!  If none of the above helps, see a doc re your tonsils.<br>  <br>  Also, work on your spelling/typing (smile now).  OK??|`|sBclzt47aa	Drink some hot tea, with not a lot of sugar if any.|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	Drink some hot Chocolate or anything that is really hot! LOL!

bGqGmWzraa	Just think of it like a routine thing... something as simple as brushing your teeth, or getting a hair cut, because it has to be done. Remember that these Dr.'s see A LOT of patients each day, and probably don't really care much about how you look, just that you are healthy. Also helps to not drink to many liquids, especially caffeine right before, this way you can easily relax. I'm almost twice your age, thin, and healthy, and I still hate going too. But I feel accomplished and revealed afterward. Just try not to think about it, lie back and imagine yourself in a far off place, that's what helps me best. ^_^|`|i8XR3Mfnaa	Going to a woman doctor helps me. It is nice to know that she knows what it is like. Another thing that helps is to remember that you are just one of about a dozen patients that doctor is going to see that day. There is no reason to be embarrassed because that doctor is probably really used to it.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	You need to go. No woman enjoys going, but if you really feel uncomfortable with the Dr, talk to your mom and see if you can go to someone else.|`|OwQsCR4Saa	It's just something everyone has to do.  It shouldn't be a big deal.  I know at your age, everything is a big deal.  They are doing what is best for you.  It's not like you HAVE to go because these doctors like to see naked people.  It's just their job and they're checking things out.  It's a good thing,..and it's over before you know it.|`|BYHRjUa6aa	Obgyn? You know, that's a doctor that delivers babies, are you pregnant? Okay, if you don't mean that, then my thoughts on my doctor are:<br>  <br>  I hate her I hate her I hate her <br>  I hate how they touch you anywhere they can fit they're hands, I hate how they sit there and tell you what stage of puberty your in. It's like duh I already know that I know more about MY body than you do.<br>  <br>  Anyways,  I can't tell you anything to make you feel better, because it sucks going. I've told my doctor not to touch me to her face before and she didn't touch me she just kept bugging me about getting my cervical cancer shot.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel. By the way, I'm 13 too.|`|jButcWbdaa	Well the doctors aren't there to judge you. It's a professional procedure that's very important for your health. It's a little uncomfortable but nothing you can't handle. Just close your eyes and relax. Just remember that everyone goes through to exact same thing. It's truly over before you know it.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	well just think of it as this. even though it may be uncomfortable it helps in the long run.

You are young and it would be uncomfortable.  The older you get the more used to it you'll get.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully you are not having intercourse, but if you are then keep this in mind:  If you feel you are old enough to have a boy touch you, then you should be mature enough to face the obgyn.|`|vEVtXftTaa	It's totally sucky and uncomfortable and everything else, but it is absolutely necessary.  For instance, my grandmother (who is relatively fat...) went too long without checking herself out, and it turned out she had a 60 POUND, FOOT IN DIAMETER MALIGNANT TUMOR in her ovary.  So GO!  You've got to.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I can't believe you're already going to an OB/GYN! I didn't go until I was 19! What is he/she checking for anyways. It's not like you've had sex!|`|nrVy8hNnaa	It is necessary for all of us women, nobody likes it but we all do it.|`|Y2fr8jp8aa	depends if the obgyn is male or female.<br>  <br>  i prefer a female. <br>  males who are young can make me uncomfortable|`|uajH0boKaa	its not a bad thing just think about how this could save your life if something is really wrong. it will make it go quicker|`|AA11146198	You have to go.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	It's an unpleasant adventure we will all go through till we're old and grey.

This is a coincidence. She made a psychological connection between losing weight and smoking weed, which is why she lost the weight she wanted - her brain wanted to lose the weight - so she did - but by WALKING.<br>  <br>  Don't make the same mistake. Smoking, especially weed, is extremely bad for you and if you smoke you won't be walking for much longer...|`|mN8xHbfUaa	Don't get me wrong I love 420 and having the munchies on it. But weed smoke does not do anything to help you lose weight if that's what you are asking. Some people use drugs that suppress your hunger hence why crack heads are so skinny. But that's a dumb thing to do.
SkDomhoXaa	i agree with those with terminal illnesses, my aunt is in the final stages of terminal cancer and it is awful the way she is suffering.<br>  and a customer of mine got diagnosed with motor nurones disease, that was horrific to see her like that, they refused treatment and she die painfully but with a small bit of dignity.... i dont understand why these people cant get help.<br>  we don't let animals suffer like this!<br>  <br>  as for those without terminal illness, like mental illness, im not sure, as most of those cases can be helped either with therapy or drugs. i have bipolar,ocd,ptsd,bpd and have wanted to die so many time, especially after the suicide of my boyfriend, i just feel if people had been there for him he would still be alive today (i don't know).<br>  maybe in certain cases but they would have to be extreme cases and monitored by a few different doctors. but i feel a majority of those cases can be helped. as for those who are wheelchair bound after an accident - personally i wouldnt want to be here, being a quadropligic to i think i would want someone to help me end my life. but each case is different and i do agree that everyone has the right to choise weather they live or die in that situation.<br>  but i repeat with the mentally ill, they need STRONG assessments to ensure that is what they truely want, i'm only saying that because right now i want to live, but this evening i may want to die.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	There is nothing dignified about suicide or running from Life [seeking to avoid the opportunity to experience pain and suffering].

AA10736671	not possible just to weight ur breast. i think u have gain the Weight all over the body and not just ur breast. any how below are the tips to reduce ur weight<br>  <br>  1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.

As for your throat, you need to soften it, a tablespoon of honey, or get those candies for your throat that are gelatin like I always use Apivita don't know if it is available in your country.  But if you don't want the candies, honey and tea or like I said above, plain honey will do the trick.  As for your dizziness, respect your body.  If you can rest up.  Stay in bed and give your body a break.  Some vitamin C wouldn't hurt I always supplement with Vitamin C during the cold and flu season.  Even now that you are sick it will still help.

AA10249159	do wrist curls with dumbells or barbell. this will really work those forearms|`|zFsTSrOcaa	The "nerves" on your arms are actually veins, and they're normal.  Large muscles require good blood circulation, including large veins.  They're most prominent when exercising and relax at rest, when there is less blood flow.  There is no way to add fat to just your forearms.<br>  <br>  Your "problems while exercising" sound normal, especially if the pain goes away after only two minutes.  It means you're not overdoing it.
q4XSkBQFaa	There is no such condition.  The spine is essentially immobile, although over the years some people get an abnormal curvature called scoliosis, lordosis, or kyphosis (depending on the location and direction of the curvature).  None of these cause shortness of breath though.  A severe injury to the spinal cord, resulting from a car crash for example, can cause problems with a person's ability to breathe if the injury is high enough on the neck.
ZoQwU2Juaa	i honestly believe that the patches make it harder to quit smoking, because they're still a nicotine safety net.  what happens when you get off the patch? you still crave nicotine from it, and you'll either want a cigarette or more patches. the best way to quit is to go cold turkey, throw your cigarettes, lighters, and ash trays away, and anything that reminds you of smoking. my girlfriend's mom just quit, and she did it in like 4 days.|`|AA12189307	Nicotine patches are just a "quit-aid", and not a cure. While they can be effective in reducing your daily cigarette intake, what they are is exactly what was just implied...an 'aid'.

M2XQMPNNaa	Certainly the "numbness" you experience due to your depression would make it extremely difficult to feel love. Prozac can be beneficial but you should certainly combine taking medication with counseling, not only to express your feelings and get feedback but to also address your substance abuse. After such a prolonged period of difficulty it may feel overwhelming once the dark cloud actually starts to lift and you begin to feel life again!! It will be a happier time but is bound to present challenges as well. The guidance of a good counselor will give you a consistent check point and support. Good luck.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Yes, give anti-depressants a shot.  But also counseling.  You are at a young age, and it's not uncommon to be unsure about love, etc.  Sometimes you need a third party who professionally helps people like you, instead of parents.  I went through a very bad bout of depression when I was your age, and I'm pretty sure one of the main causes was drug use screwing up my brain chemistry--ecstasy tends to do that.  But once I was on paxil, I felt better and became obsessed with girls again in no time.|`|b08c32e520878f1a8c47b1cd9359eb59aa	My dear friend your expectations are not too high...Prozac will help you but you have to start thinking about life differently as well.We make our lifes,we decide ,medications can help us see things differently and realise what we have being missing.So yes Prozac can do its job,if it doesnt at some point another antidepressant should be considered,but what you need to do is to make your own life beautiful,start to appreciate every moment in this life,from taking a shower to making love,drinking a glass of wine,feeling its every taste,smelling its aroma.I believe that we can change,and see the amazing things that have being hidden from us due to the mental blindness.I hope this will help you.|`|bSTckneLaa	Depression can cause emotionless but i beleive that the substance abuse is playing a MAJOR role in your romanticless life. i grew up with my brothers and sisters addicted to drugs and they not only didnt feel romance but they had no love for their own family. As for Prozac again it is a drug also even if the goverment says its ok, millions of people are addicted to goverment "ok-ed" drugs. i think what im saying is first you need to work on your drug habbits maybe find your nitch or a fun habit and some friends that like that habbit also, then work on your depression. I also think that friends will help both of these problems. i hope i helped you and may god watch over you on your journey to a better life.<br>  ~~Danny rodd.

That's why it is not recommended to begin weightlifting under the age of 16.  Just don't smoke, don't drink beer or booze or do drugs.  Get off junk food & fast food garbage & sugary sweet soda's.  Get on a good, balanced, healthy diet with lots of boiled or steamed vegetables.  Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & fat free milk.  Snack on lots of raw fruit & veggies.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Get a good nite's sleep.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Ok all of you blackhead sufferers, lets get you all sorted out.<br>  <br>  What I am about to tell you is the complete opposite of what you think you should be doing but I can assure you it works.<br>  <br>  The reason the blackheads appear is because your skin is actually being made too dry by the products you are using to get rid of them. Because the skin is being dried up the oil glands will produce much more oil than they would if they were moisturized. So this is the way to go.....<br>  <br>  Firstly stop using ordinary soap, it is far too drying. Use an emollient wash like E45 (I am in UK so if you are elsewhere you may not be able to get E45 emollient wash but any emollient wash will do)<br>  <br>  It will feel a bit strange at first because it doesn't lather like ordinary soap but you will soon get used to it. Just wet your face with a flannel, put some wash in the palm of your hand, run a little drop of water (not much) onto it and smooth it over both hands. Apply to your face rubbing it in as though it were ordinary soap. Then rinse off well with your flannel and pat dry. Now, if you are not about to put make up on, apply Nivea soft moisturizing cream. Every time you do this you will be reducing the amount of oil your own skin is producing and keep those nasty blackheads at bay.<br>  <br>  Before you start doing this, squeeze as many blackheads out as you can because the treatment won't get rid of the ones you have already got, it will just stop new ones from forming.<br>  <br>  If you are unable to get nivea, just use any cream with jojoba and vitamin E in it.<br>  <br>  The oil glands will always over produce if they detect dryness and that is what is causing the blackheads to form.<br>  <br>  I hope this will help you rid them forever!<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I'm in my 60's and have never gotten rid of them and I've tried it all.  So I use a foundation and powder - does a great job!|`|6nrLRKmeaa	I have tried every kind of scub, face wash, acne system, etc and I still have them.

M2XQMPNNaa	Carbs that are "good" give you quality nutrients and break down more slowly, giving you "fuel" over a longer period of time. Examples would be; whole grain breads, brown rice etc. Bad carbs act in your body like sugar, they give you a quick jump of energy without additional nutrients and are burned up quickly leading you to crave more! Examples would be; sugary things, white bread, white rice,junk food such as doritos etc.Bad carbs wreak havoc on your metabolism. The best way to fuel your body is to eat more frequent, smaller meals that include good (or "complex") carbohydrates along with a lean quality protein, along with fresh fruits and/or veggies. Examples; whole oats oatmeal with skim milk and berries then turkey and veggies on whole grain bread or a salad with ckn. breast and a slice of whole grain bread and for dinner a portion of salmon (size of a pack of cards) with brown rice or quinoa and vegetables. Snacks in between can be fresh fruit , low-fat (non-sugary!) yogurt with fiber, raw almonds, raw veggies etc. Drinking lots of water helps your body to metabolize these foods and increases the benefit of the fiber rich grains.|`|12834d3ffd247266441c18ee003ca1e3aa	Good carbs are called complex carbs.  These come from whole grain brown rice, quinoa, whole grain wheat bread -pasta, whole wheat waffles Sweet Potatoes-probably one of the best vegtables on the planet for you.<br>  It is not necessarly the bad carbs are bad, you just need to limit the intake of them and replace them with complex carbs. <br>  <br>  Tip:  If you are trying to lose weight and workout 3-4 times a week for strength training, try to eat the bulk of your carb intake before and after your workout and do not eat carbs at night.  eat 5-6 times  day.|`|4sr1Mn7yaa	there are no good carbs or bad . everything you eat or drink has carbs your body needs all of them. if your trying to watch your carbs your going to be tired of it. just eat the right serving of food.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	white breads and biscuits are bad carbs<br>  not sure about good carbs try looking at a food pyramid<br>  hope i helped :)

It just means you're left to dwell on your own thoughts and feelings. When you're with people you're busy and distracted and have no time to think about how you feel. You live in the moment. But when you're alone, you tend to mope. Try and keep yourself around others as much as possible and when you can't, keep your mind distracted in other ways by watching TV or taking up a hobby or something. :)
IeOeYOJ3aa	The reason it becomes harder for people to lose weight after a certain age is the same reason for why people gain weight easily after a certain age: metabolism. After people are done growing, their bodies don't need as much energy (calories) to keep their bodies doing what they do. Since a lot of people don't really know that their metabolism slows down after a certain age, they continue eating like they're teenagers, consuming more calories than they need, which causes them to gain weight. When they try to lose that weight it's harder than it is for a teenager to lose weight since the metabolism of a forty year old isn't as going to burn as much calories for energy as a fifteen year olds.

WNsjy5oFaa	yes - nothing not even a cotton bud should be put in the ear canal<br>  i work in emergency and we are always retrieving things from peoples ears particularly children, most common offender is beads and cotton buds. <br>  if left they cause infection, plus by using cotton buds or fingers to clear wax you end up pushing the wax further into the ear canal and impacting it which can be very painful and cause reduction in hearing and possible damage to the ear drum|`|9z7k8HCXaa	Yes and you should never ever put a q tip/cotton bud in your ear!

You ear is self cleaning, and is lined with tiny hairs that lead all the wax out of the ear, to keep it from blocking your ears. If you stick things down into teh ear canal, you are in danger of chaging the direction of these delicate hairs, and thus, the wax will be pushed deep into your ears, and you will get impacted ear wax, and you will go deaf, and will have to get it removed by a professional. <br>  <br>  Your ear canal is perfectly capable of cleaning itself, so best leave it to so its job without interference, and just give the outer ear a wipe every day.|`|LriMdquJaa	Putting anything besides a Q-tip for cleaning is a bad idea.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	yes|`|rsdKX1fyaa	Yes.

Interesting.......|`|fk8wXA3Saa	your bladder lays against your G spot , when the bladder is full it pushes the G spot further into the vaginal canal causing it to recieve greater stimulation.<br>  You can get a minor implant between the urinary bladder and the outer wall of the vagina /cervix to place the G spot into position for Grafenberg orgasms from sexual stimulation . here is a link explaining it .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-spot" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-spot</a>|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Probably because of the pressure. But I'm gonna be totally honest, even if I embarras myself. I DID pee once during orgasm because I had a full bladder. Luckily I was in the shower, but I've always made sure to pee beforehand because of that.|`|pVJJ9R85aa	your disgusting.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	idk but nice|`|XTj0LP6gaa	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that your bladder pushes on squishy stuff inside of you that rubs and makes it feel better for you.|`|jButcWbdaa	Just be careful because you can get infections if you have sex with a full bladder.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Really? I always try to pee beforehand because I'm afraid that I might pee on myself while I climax.<br>  <br>  Lucky you!|`|ptTZMe0Oaa	interesting|`|vEVtXftTaa	Probably the pressure that your bladder puts on your g-spot... that's my only guess.  But I've had the same experience!|`|L2t7Ek4paa	Thats a new one...|`|S6dM85fxaa	hell ya, i like this|`|xMnN99T8aa	Probably increased pressure on the surrounding tissue. Just don't pee on yourself.|`|UKkohcNiaa	lol that happends to my all the time my bf thinks thats sexy;)<br>  lol he's a freak && so am i...<br>  lol<br>  anyways...<br>  its totaly normal...
axHBSvFwaa	ok when i read this it reminded me of..me!! ok so i suffer from migraines..i get headaches daily and have been given tablets i have to take daily to control them..i would advise you to see your doctor, i also have scoliosis, could it be your eyes?? another thing which can cause your headaches is tension built up in your neck. this is all what my doctor has told me. i have moved around to different physio, chiropracteracter as well it doesn't work doing that. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|zDeEaja0aa	Do you have any allergies? Allergies can cause headaches. I know when I don't take my allergy medication I get headaches every single day.<br>  <br>  In all honesty you should call your Medical Doctor and schedule an appointment, headaches can be a sign of a variety of complications (some major and others minor).|`|8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	The first thing I recommend is to see a naturopathic doctor as they work wonders where western doctors fail.<br>  <br>  Its quite possible its caused by something you are eating. Its hard to know sometimes because food can actually affect you up to 4 days after you've eaten it. <br>  <br>  I had migraines for years and years. my own doctor couldn't figure it out and nothing helped. Within one month of seeing a naturalpathic doctor she figured it out and now they are almost completely gone. For me it was dairy. If I have any I am garanteed a migraine 4 days later - almost to the minute. My regular doctor never figured it out because he only had me record what I ate the day before the migraine, so we never found the pattern.<br>  <br>  It could also be sinuses or blood pressure, so its good to get it checked out.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, one thing I found that works really well is to apply tiger balm to your temples, forehead and the back of your neck along the hairline. <br>  It sooths headaches very fast, and its safe to use no matter what meds you may be on.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|Q5eLg9Hvaa	I honestly don't know. I would recommend exercise and diet, and going to a chiropractor, but you have done that. Maybe stretching for your back and neck. I stretch every day, and it really helps my back and neck. You say your pillow sucks? I often start out in bed with a rolled up towel under my neck. I don't know what else to suggest. Maybe physical therapy?|`|gcgsmXU2aa	1)drink a glass of warm milk every morning<br>  2)you could be putting alot of strain on your eyes so go for eye exam<br>  3)the same thing used to happen to me but i got an eye exam and realised i'm slowly becoming short-sited|`|jSqit9uLaa	try having some caffenine|`|acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	How about drinking enough water?  Do you realize that 80% of headaches stem from being dehydrated?  That is probably why working out triggers a headache for you.<br>  <br>  Increase your water intake and most likely, your headaches will occur much less often.
cb2NxPERaa	You can't spot reduce, meaning you can't lose weight in only certain area of your body. To do it efficiently, you'll have to lose weight everywhere. Eat healthy, drink a lot of water and exercise for at least an hour for a while.<br>  ** Your big breasts may be genetic, if they are, this won't help much and the only thing you can do is get a breast reduction surgery.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i have exactly the same problem, im a size 8 but all my tops end up above my belly button because my boobs have grown :( x|`|hXehbPVqaa	you cant just loss weight from one part of the body with out all your body fat being reduced and you will never know where you will start to loss weight you cant pick the spot<br>  <br>  my friend has the same probably as you and she is saving to get a breast reduction because there isn't much else you can do.|`|mN8xHbfUaa	It's probably not fat. Your boobs are not made of fat unless you are fat lol
AA10350894	If you believe that you look at porn too much, then for you... you probably do.<br>  The solution to your "problem" is to simply exercise some will power!<br>  Personally I think it would only be a problem if you are letting the viewing of porn to interfere with your normal activities and social interactions. For example, if you'd rather stay locked up in your room surfing the web for porn then going out and interacting with real people face to face or you are falling behind on your responsibility's.<br>  Sexually speaking men are visually driven,  that's why we find porn so attractive. So it's not unusual or out of the question to occasionally desire to view it. Just don't let it get in the way of other things you'd like to do or NEED to do!|`|AA11785060	Turn off your computer and go for a walk. Do this anytime you think you are addicted or obsessed to anything  you are looking at or doing online, whether it is viewing porn, excessive chatting with friends, gaming, or whatever.  The problem is more likely addiction to the computer.  That can be obsessive.  Walks always make people feel better mentally and they are good for you anyway.|`|fadeVH4baa	No, its all natural. Enjoy yourself!<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone ever tell you it's wrong. Unless its sadism or something lol.|`|a8mQuc4iaa	um no you are normal <br>  your 16 a boy you like porn, whats wrong?
sS65j9Wraa	thats actually a good question!!!<br>  well as the other people said warm, tingly, horny, but here is a little known fact... (!!)<br>  the clitoris is actually a whole system thingy, and also becomes hard when you're horny..<br>  xxxxx|`|ADP9swbMaa	The vagina begins to produce it's natural lubrication. <br>  For many women, they feel a warm and/or tingling sensation in the vaginal region.|`|EtgHIoNHaa	Like it's hard to explain our hormones change and we feel the need to touch ourselves, and like if were watching something you get "Horny" and touch yourself.<br>  It doesn't feel like anything you just want to play with yourself I guess haha
7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	When I feel nauseous, I tend toward foods that are plain and simple. I would eat some nice whole wheat bread for energy and drink plenty of fluids. I also usually eat plain vegetables, just because my stomach is too picky to eat anything else when I don't have an appetite. You could also try making a fruit smoothie of some kind. Sometimes it's easier to drink something than it is to eat a meal when you feel sick.
n0WnEIopaa	It depends, are you friends with her, or do you just sit beside her?<br>  <br>  If you are friends with her I would just simply say, "I feel bad bringing this up, but I don't want people talking about you badly, so I just wanted you to know that your breath is bad, and I can smell it from far away"<br>  <br>  <br>  If you just sit beside her, I would leave a note on her desk, type it so she doesn't know who it is from, get to class early, slip it on her desk before she gets there. If you are brave you could just hand it to her. <br>  <br>  But, I would be super nice about it in the note, and write it as though you are doing her a favor..|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Buy her stocks in Wrigley Gum and give them to her. Let the hint speak for itself.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	First, you need to understand what causes bad breath.  The more knowledge you have the better you will be at helping someone else solve the problem.  The major cause of bad breath is the bacteria on the top of the tongue.  These bacteria produce the bad smells.  Using mints and gum just covers up the bad breath, they do not kill the bacteria.  To cure bad breath you must remove the bacteria that causes bad breath.  This takes a tongue cleaner.  I use an OraBrush.  Here is their website:  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>  Now you are prepared to tell your friend, after you have cleaned your tongue you can tell her that you had some bad breath and this is how you solved it.  Offer the opportunity to get an OraBrush.  Or, you could buy two of them, one for you and one for her.|`|AA10743159	The problem with having bad breath, is the person having it, often doesn't realize it.  So it would be a kindness by you, to let her know.<br>  Of course the smoking doesn't help either.<br>  Just be as nice and kind as you can, but you will be doing her a big favor, if you let her know. Then at least, she can brush her teeth more, and use a mouthwash, etc.
DI3u9gMSaa	There are lots of colors.  I chose clear because I work and need to talk to people.  It's better that my teeth aren't so colorful as to distract the people I talk to.  If you're in school or don't need to worry about appearance, go crazy.  Keep in mind the length of your treatments.  If you need them for years, be conservative.  If you only need them for six months to a year, you can be a little more creative.<br>  <br>  Below is my site that shows the clear braces on my uppers.|`|g5Dpw3iRaa	you can get 2 colors 1 on top and 1 on bottom. so if u r a gator fan like me i assume u should get blue and orange or be creative and get any other. blue,green,pink,purple,yellow,orange|`|uZbmRnuLaa	yes there are white and clear ones.<br>  the rest would be standard rainbow colors plus others..<br>  like red, blue, pink, purple, green, yellow, orange <br>  (they come in both light and dark shades)|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	I'd get blue, like the one's off ugly betty lol :]|`|joyXUpkMaa	Omgg don't worry about the colour because when I went and got my braces (which were 2 colours, lavendar and silver), the next day both the colours of my braces changed green!! And they still are.<br>  And green was the last colour I wanted to get<br>  <br>  So just remember that the colours may fade.<br>  You may need to ask you're dentist about it.
woOeYFrEaa	Yes, it is bad.  The longer its in your colon, the more water is pulled out of it.  So holding it can lead to constipation and really hard, dry stools that can cause hemerrhoids and/or anal fissures (tears in your butt hole).<br>  <br>  Realize that everyone poops and its fine to go at school.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	how can you hold on to you poop, i **** my pants,,,|`|PTWnWkPRaa	it can cause damage when you are older. if you have issues going to the bathroom (number 2) then you can take acidolphus pills you can buy them at a health store or grocery store... take 3 put them in yogurt or apple sauce.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Yes, it's very not good for you. <br>  Sorry, but you need to get over it and use the bathrooms at your work. You'll be much more comfortable throughout the day.|`|EtgHIoNHaa	Haha my mom's bf does this because he works in transports I know it's weird to say, It's not good for you but I do the same like if Im at school;.|`|H3giw4QHaa	It's definitely not good to hold it in.  You could end up damaging your sphincter muscles.

BhySoLoSaa	In Australia the cost of a standard 20 - 30 minute visit comes to a ridicules $60. Thankfully I go to a bulk-billing doctor which is free.<br>  <br>  I dont think they would charge by time for a pap smear, those things is usually a one price thing. I would say about $50.

07fb16ab80bfdbf75e1dc1a451479dcbaa	I have the same problem, I have had unsightly acne a long time, I have whiteheads and blackheads especially on my nose, and I have them all the time, then I will get pimple breakouts every 1-4 weeks. It sucks, all the acne stuff hasn't worked for me, but the way I keep blackheads and whiteheads under control  is with a blackhead removal tool, you can get one at walmart for like two dollars or something, you use it when you get out of the shower when your pores are opened up, glide it along the affected area, the blackheads and whiteheads will pop out. Buy this stuff called Witch hazel, and apply it to your entire face with a cotton ball to soothe your skin after you use the tool. Then when you are finished make sure to disinfect the tool with some rubbing alcohol or Lysol spray. This is only a temporary fix, you will have to use it again when you see them coming back. Oh, and for those painful whiteheads, apply neosporin to them before you go to before you go to bed or when you are just chilling at home with no makeup on. Neosporin is antibacterial and will help kill the bacteria that is causing the problem. Keep in mind that these remedies aren't going to make your skin miraculously clear, what I like to call it is "management", my skin still sucks, but I can keep the breakouts down to where I can at least cover them up with makeup and have the illusion of clear skin. Good Luck!|`|xJW1RSaAaa	I have the same problem under my eyes, they're called millia.  You can go for a facial where they do an extraction method to get rid of the ones you have.

72iZuDjeaa	uncircumcised is better, you lose a lot more than just skin with circumcision,,, trust me...|`|TsjqzanQaa	Anyone with intelligence can understand that a normal, whole, and natural penis with a foreskin feels and functions better than one that's been mutilated, made partial and scarred by the mutilation of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Those who think that it "looks better" are individuals who are unfamiliar with the complete penis.     <br>  <br>  In most of the world, the men are intact, and unmutilated, and in most countries they think that the penis scarred from circumcision looks ugly and strange.<br>  <br>  I was a victim of the assault and mutilation of circumcision as a defenseless infant.      The resulting damage destroyed more than the usual 50-75% of sexual sensitivity in my case.      This made it impossible for me to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I finally found out about foreskin restoration, and have vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function, together with increasing the intensity of orgasms.<br>  <br>  Having been on both sides of the fence, so to speak, I can attest that it is so incredibly much better with a foreskin, even a restored one.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|AA10350894	There is no "better" as such, it is simply a matter of personal preference. Unless one has a medical need for it, there is no reason to be circumcised other then a personal preference for it.<br>  If you decide to get circumcised, do it because that's what YOU want, not because a bunch of people on a web site said you should!

Circumcision is a man made procedure that removes most of the sensitive skin on the penis, leaves ugly scars, uneven skin, and tight and painful erections.<br>  For women that say they like a circumcised penis, they are saying they like their men mutilated.  Before they have the credentials to say that, they need to be strapped into a straight jacket so they cannot squirm, or writhe in pain, placed on a procedure table and let some hack in a lab coat perform female circumcision on them, with no pain reduction.

Aesthetically it is up to the individual. Women can like one or the other just like some men like big breasts and some like small breasts.

BhySoLoSaa	There are many ways you can improve those factors, these are listed below.<br>  <br>  1. Meditation - Just spending 5 - 10 minutes after you wake up to just sit in a meditative position and try to organize your thoughts will help things dramatically for the rest of your day.<br>  <br>  2. Bike Riding / Walking - Increasing your daily walk intake helps balance a lot, but if you really want some improvement bike riding helps target the inner part of your body and help you balance during other situations.<br>  <br>  3. Sleep - Make sure you get a good night sleep, even if you don't sleep this long you should still go to bed 9 hours before you are required to wake up, that way you should feel refreshed at any time.<br>  <br>  4. Lifting weights - A great activity to improve coordination, especially side lifts - make sure you do this in front of a mirror to make sure your back is straight while attempting.<br>  <br>  5.

4ILA5CDzaa	It depends on the level of abuse .. <br>  For example .. to make myself a little more clear ..<br>  When you are high, you see things in a different perspective, you notice the beauty of a person that you did not see normally . You can appreciate music more because you actually listen to the lyrics . <br>  Most people believe when you smoke pot it makes you stupid/lazy/stressful .. This only happens if you make it a constant habit .. such as smoking it 3-5 times daily . You can be a responsible smoker, although some beg to differ . It is like being more open-minded to ideas and such . <br>  -or-<br>  Instead of appreciating things you have never thought about before, you laugh a lot with your friends about good times, bad times, and whatever times . Weed brings people together . Plain and simple . There is no hate, there is no competition, it is just enjoying yourself and your surroundings for at least a little bit .<br>  <br>  <br>  Weed has been labeled as something bad for you, when actually it was put on this planet for a reason . It is 100% natural, unless laced . <br>  The media has put out messages such as "it causes schizophrenia" or "anxiety". Complete lies .. Out of all the years I have been smoking and been around people who smoke, not a single one has been through any of these problems . My entire family smokes from my great-grand parents down to me, and most of them have been to college, have secruity in their financial status, and have successful careers and businesses . <br>  <br>  I disagree with people who compare it with crack and meth .. The only time a person can actually make that accusation is if they have actually experienced the drugs crack and meth . There is no comparison, there is no drug out there that can give you the same relaxation as marijuana . All of the drugs out there make you wired and stressed, and make you lose sight of reality .<br>  <br>  For those of you who say drink instead ...<br>  Let us compare ..<br>  Alcohol - Dizziness, fights, blackouts, hangovers, lasts for hours, unplanned pregancies, STD's, over-emotional, stupidity, "invincible thoughts", fatty liver, liver cancer, in some cases brain damage, depression, addiction, and the list goes on ..<br>  Marijuana - Happiness, stressless, "giggles", "stoned eyes", in major cases lung cancer (cigs are worse for your lungs but you don't see them illegal), perspective, for some people concentration is better.. etc .. <br>  <br>  <br>  I am not trying to get you to smoke, I am merely exposing the truth that most people don't understand .<br>  <br>  The only cases in which marijuana becomes a problem is when the weak minded they "can't stop smoking" and are "addicted" ..<br>  Marijuana is not an addictive substance .. That is why I said "weak minded" because only the weak make it a problem in their own mind .<br>  <br>  Well, I am just ranting .. good luck <br>  <br>  Any questions? Message me .|`|W20KslFzaa	Depends on what you're getting high on....let's assume you mean pot.<br>  <br>  Well, it's like being tired, but not tired.  You are only kind of half listening/paying attention to everything, but that just makes things funny for some reason.  But at the same time you can really focus and concentrate on ONE thing, and over analyze it.  This can lead you to crack great jokes, or come up with new and bizarre solutions/ideas.<br>  <br>  For some people it works almost like an anti-anxiety drug, like zanex, and just balances them out.  Other people it can make them feel paranoid and scared.<br>  <br>  It's a tough question to answer, because it'll be different for everyone, but still similar.  It's like trying to explain what being in love is like.  Or what it feels like to really hate someone.

It's kind of like your very drunk but without feeling sick to your stomach. Something like that, It all depends on the way you think at the moment. If your happy doing it might make you feel happy. By the way I'm only talking about weed I never tried anything else. If you feel nervous you might have a bad trip. Either way it slows the way you think and everything seems so cloudy.|`|0y6hw5c4aa	well i used to smoke weed. <br>  the high just made me feel extremely happy, and i was laughing at absolutely nothing funny. i just keep giggling a lot. <br>  i also used to feel light headed, i could be walking and it felt like i was walking on air. <br>  im not saying its the best feeling in the world, but it did have a good feeling. <br>  but sometimes after i was high, i would continue to keep smoking more. <br>  i would be high for days...<br>  and the munchies i used to get...oh boy. <br>  i'll be sitting there stuffing my face and i didnt even notice that i was eating something.<br>  idk about getting high off anything else, the only drug i've did was weed...(and i honestly dont even consider that a drug.)|`|LOfZNNdfaa	It's like time stops, every thing is enhanced, colors get brighter, food is tastier, your sex drive is on full blast, everything feels so good.  Music sounds better, a stereo sounds like surround sound.  Sometimes you start seeing things, like little leppercons running away with your stapler.  Sometimes you hear things like the Devil giving you orders.  Everything feels like cotton. Eating a piece of a bush taste like eating pizza.You feel like there is always a cool breeze even if your inside.  You can feel cigarette smoke go down your lungs, I mean literally feel it.  Sometimes when you look at people they look warped.  Like there heads are really big and their arms are really small like a t-rex.  Sometimes when you like in the mirror you see the grim reaper instead of yourself.  It's scary.  Some times you can move things with your mind.  Sometimes you can eat a whole large pizza by yourself.  Sometimes you feel like bugs are crawling under your skin and eating your brain.  Sometimes you black out and wake up on someones front lawn.  Sometimes   Sometimes your eyes get so red that you look like the devil.  Sometimes you just want to dance.  Sometimes you think that everybody in the room can read your mind.  Sometimes you don't feel high at all.|`|objZ18JKaa	When you hear about people being high all you hear about is the negative side affects because those are the things that are easy to pinpoint.

Your body will stand a greater chance of staying healthier for longer.<br>  <br>  Yes at first it is very difficult but the first 3 weeks are the worst I think,  (I have been stopped now for 4 years),  It is like something is missing initially and it takes a while for the body to readjust to being smoke free, your body chemistry will be changing and clearing out toxins so it is no wonder you are not feeling yourselves, to help this process I recommend drinking lots of water and eating oranges to help stave the cravings and to replenish Vit C in the body.  Also taking exercise daily - ie a walk out together each day.<br>  <br>  You will find as times passess things will become easier and easier.<br>  <br>  Good wishes to you and your partner and once again Congratulations and keep up the good work.

Not only does eating peppers suppress appetite so you eat less—studies show that people eat fewer calories in a meal that typically includes chili, cayenne, or other types of "hot" peppers—but peppers also rev up metabolism, so you burn more calories even when you're not exercising. <br>  At only four calories per tablespoon, chili peppers also provide one-third of the daily recommendation for vitamin C, 10 percent of <br>  vitamin A, and several other antioxidants. <br>  You can also drink Equate or Ensure -a vitamin filled, balanced meal in a can that will give you plenty of energy and is only 300 or so calories.

UDReyI9jaa	I have also had trouble finding information about this place! My consultant has never heard of Scoliogold and says that if I can't find scientific evidence to back up their claims then I should take them with a pinch of salt. I probably had the same letter as you, telling me that my scoliosis would progress unless I start their treatment immediately. My doctor was quite angry about this, as my scoliosis has been stable for years! He looked at their website and said that proper medical clinics don't rely on anecdotal patient testamonies to promote their claims, they publish proper studies which are reviewed by independent experts. As you say, its a bit worrying that there is no healthcare body or watchdog overseeing this clinic. Youre OK if the physios do something wrong because (I think) they're regulated by the physios regulatory body, but if anything else goes wrong and you have a problem with the clinic itself then youre screwed and they can tell you to eff off and keep your money. Also if the treatment doesn't work they can just say its your fault for not working hard enough. If anyone else knows anything at all about Scoligold and who invented it and what their credentials are my consultant and myself would be very interested to hear it.

If you're trying to burn that many calories with strength exercises good luck, you better have all day. As for 200 cal, your walking should be more like jogging, for quite a few miles.

BhySoLoSaa	Ok, here is a mathematical equation to your problem.<br>  You're BMI stands for Body Mass Index and it shows you whether you are over weight, under weight or just normal.<br>  <br>  The BMI rates are as follows:<br>  Under weight = Under 18.5<br>  Normal weight = 18.5-24.9<br>  Overweight = 25-29.9<br>  Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater<br>  <br>  To work out BMI all you have to do is [Weight(kg)] divided by [height(m) x height(m)]<br>  <br>  So its your weight divided by your height squared.<br>  <br>  Your BMI = 20.0 exactly<br>  <br>  To sum it up as you can see above you are perfectly in the normal weight area. I don't recommend any change in diet or exercise for you.<br>  <br>  Some people just grow fat in different places so it looks like you weigh more then normal, don't let this bother you.

Just be patient with him and tell him to listen to you softly or you can ask him to tie it to his waist and wear it if he feels cold.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	It has been proved that you can't catch colds from being cold. It is all from a virus as someone else has mentioned.<br>  <br>  I also agree with someone else who said that children, (as well as people my age) sometimes refuse to wear jumpers and coats if it doesn't make them look good.|`|dDGdombuaa	you could take all his clothes away when he wants to go out to play and just give him access to his p j's, he may in the future want to listen to what you are requesting. good luck|`|wuDRHFcsaa	be strict!|`|uZbmRnuLaa	boys will be boys.<br>  they want to look macho i guess.<br>  <br>  they have to learn the hard way at times<br>  (:<br>  take it slow|`|lwXEK969aa	You should know the answer to this, i am assuming that you were once a kid too|`|Pwmcpo5Paa	ummm colds come from a virus and do not come because you only wear a T-shirt....You cannot catch cold you can only catch the Virus that causes a cold. Teach your kid to wash his hands instead.
X6aRNbqKaa	I would say its coming up close. I didn't start mine till I was 12. Cramps would be a sign that it should be soon. How is your diet? Make sure you are eating right, not starving yourself, for that will cause it to not happen regularly as well as stress. Your depressed state probably did not help it become constant. Don't expect a regular occurring period either, that doesn't always occur till you get older. If you are really concerned, talk to a doctor, but as I see it, there is no need for concern. Just keep track of what is happening and relax. Yes, discharge is natural. It happens before periods occur, for younger girls that might be all you have at first, when you get older, it might still happen just before it hits. Always remember to talk to another more experienced woman if you have questions.|`|oiB4KATuaa	Yeah, you're ok, I had a period for one day when I was around 11, and then about a year later it started properly so you're ok, you sound just like me, so its all happening normally!:)|`|is83hotFaa	I'm 13, and had my first period at 11- 5 days before i was due to turn 12. By what you're describing, I think you'll get it VERY soon.<br>  <br>  I had about that same amount of hair, cramps..etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	YOU need to calm down. Making a big deal about it will just make things MUCH worse! You are sooo soo sooooOOO young..no worries.<br>  Your body is going through lots of changes... emotionally and physically...all over the place and yes it's seems like your head is spinning and you feel out of control... that is totally normal when you first start going through all that mess at your age. It's tough, I know. I've been through it!! But you gotta hang in there and let your body just roll with it. However, there are many many over the counter pills for pains, irritability... cramps.. mood swings to help you get through it.. yeah! When I started when I was 12 my mom always had the pills called "Midol or Pampron" on hand...and OH MY GOSH they worked!!! They're very common for girls who just started going through all those changes. It helps you relax and it aids menstrual cramps and mood swings. I'm not a doctor but I've been there! I've been having periods, mood swings, and menstrual cramps for 17 years.. and still going strong. And now I get to be there for my 11 year old daughter when she starts her period which is verrrrry soon. She's already feeling the bodily changes and feelings and all that..We all get through it girl!!!<br>  <br>  Hang in there! Remember to take a look at those pills in the "girly<br>  section" of any grocery/drug store. They're called Midol or Pamprin!
f5d911179b5535ec45cbb6bd90b28248aa	Yes it is possible, but If you are still alive after getting influenza, it means you have developed an immunity to that strain  and your body has the ability fend it off again if the virus gets in your body. So next time you do get that particular strain, you may get a little ill, but not as bad as before. The first time your body needed time to develop an immunity against it, hence why the fever and other pains.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  So if it is passed back and forth, it will continue until it has all been eradicated|`|qJNevpELaa	Both of your bodies will eventually become immune to it, so no.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You both will become immune with that particular strain for a little bit.So, no, you will not pass it back and forth to each other.<br>  <br>  Feel better soon.

BgQvmZYzaa	Ive had an eating disorder for 3.5 years now. I used to be fat and then i lost weight dramatically and became way underweight. People started to call me anorexic, bulimic and then it got to my head. Now im crazy and my whole life revoles around my body image. My friends dont want to be around me anymore and i dont want to be around anyone. It sucks and i cant help it.|`|K4SOAACTaa	Wat ur question ??? If u want to kno wat anorexia is its someone dat barely never eats and is underweight and wants to be skinnier. When i was anorexic i would only one or two small things a day and lose like more dan ten pounds a week and yea i can see all my ribs n i was super skinny n when i got to my goal which was 85 pounds i stoped|`|ciz0qYwnaa	There were many reasons why I had anorexia.<br>  <br>  I want to be a ballerina, and have lived with that dream since I was a kid. My mum was a ballerina in a company's corps the ballet, but because of a serious ankle or hip accident/problem (don't remember which) she had to stop. She has always pushed me to do ballet because she regrets what happened to her. And obviously in ballet, girls are very very thin. You can't be bigger than 110 lbs because dancers won't be able to lift you. My mum repeatedly told me to eat little so that I could fulfill her dream that is now mine.   <br>  <br>  But it got really serious at 12. I don't remember how exactly but I think it had something to do with my ballet teacher at the time who said I was too big for ballet. <br>  <br>  I am a perfectionist, so when something in my life goes wrong I immediately go crazy. At 12 I started morphing out of my childhood flat body into a teen's. I didn't want breasts but they came. I didn't want hips but they came. <br>  <br>  I started eating very less than required and purged (vomited) after eating too much. But my bulimia stopped a year later (through medical help) and my anorexia started. It's a cycle and it continued till this passing summer. I dropped to 111 lbs. It seemed great but it was gross; you could see all my bones, I was tired, my hair was falling out and I fainted a few times. I'm still recovering now, and got my weight up to 135lbs while knowing that this weight is not what I need for a ballet career. <br>  <br>  I think anorexia can also be genetic. My mum and my grandfather had it. But the general thing is, people who suffer from anorexia want to please others and themselves. They want to be happy, and think that by reaching a goal weight they'll reach happiness - I thought after I got skinny I'd attract more guys and fit in nicer clothes. Sure, the clothes fitted me better, but no guy wanted a sack of bones. <br>  <br>  Having an eating disorder is horrible. I wouldn't wish it even upon my worst enemy.|`|UOJk5CBLaa	I have been proanamia for three years. In middle school it was a mental battle, I would see girls that were so pretty, they were all skinnier than me. I decided to be pretty I needed to be as thin as possible. If I see a girl that's smaller than me I see it as another goal, to be skinnier than her. I have depression, and anxiety but I'd rather be beautiful and miserable than ugly and happy.|`|uUvV7eadaa	there are tons of different things that could trigger an eating disorder. <br>  <br>  mine started because my mom was abusive, and she also had an eating disorder, so I sort of followed her lead.|`|JXw0U77aaa	Sorry, what's your question?  "anerexia...........?" is not a question.  And on top of that, it's spelled "anorexia."|`|gYDIL3Ipaa	when i look in the mirror i dont see a fat person, i just dont see what i want to see. for me the only way of looking good is by being thin. i eat very little in a day and if i eat more than i should i feel really guilty. for some people with classic anorexia they see an image in their mind of themselves thats not true, but i dont, i just want to be super skinny like they are so i wouldnt consider myself to have an eating disorder.|`|N7ppMWKpaa	I have had an eating disorder for the last ten years.  Mine started because I had always been a fat child and as a result was bullied at school.  As I grew up I became obsessed with losing weight and exercise.  I have very low self esteem, even though I am getting better I still have lapses.  It does rule my life even though I am trying not to let it.|`|BugeV1Mdaa	It's anorexia with an o.<br>  And quite often it's to do with self control - ie, you can control how much you eat and how thin you get even when you can't control all the other **** in your life.|`|Gwtmvcmlaa	I got anorexic because my brother called me fat and my dad said I'd get porky... And I've had low self-esteem for ages, I don't think I'll ever fully recover :(|`|hXehbPVqaa	it all starts with the mind you are telling yourself you are fat.<br>  and maybe your not... but the mind is tricking you saying u are so of course its a mental disorder|`|GZZyJJfZaa	im sorrry but what is your question?
RP2QQXbjaa	There's no generic for Yaz yet, but there IS a generic for Yasmin, which is very similar but slightly different doses.  The generic is called Ocella and you could talk to your doctor about it.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	more than likely you are not going to find it anywhere cheaper. since yaz is still new on the market they can charge what they like because they get so many years before anyone can make a generic of the product.|`|y2XKYhsyaa	my insurance makes my yaz 20 bucks.|`|p31xjIFWaa	i get it for free at the supermarket

La9fanNbaa	The only semi - perm way is to get Botox on your hands. This will prevent all sweating. If you go to the doctor I know they can prescribe Drysol. It stings a little but will prevent sweating.|`|0y6hw5c4aa	use a lot of hand santizer or just wash your hands with soap and warm water a lot. <br>  im sorry but the only way i see your hands not sweating is by making them really dry, and the things i just mentioned will do that to your hands. <br>  before you hold hands with him, throw some hand santizer on.<br>  hope something helps =)|`|mSJmowzDaa	First off calm down. your going way over board. <br>  <br>  your body produces heat . when 2  heat producing surfaces such as 2  hands having contact and constantly holding. will give off heat and sweat<br>  <br>  also the fact that you are attracted to your boy friend . will also cause your body to become hotter and expand heat. such as the touching of hands <br>  <br>  an example have you ever heard a girl say that guy turns me on. she is getting turned on . when the body lusts and attracts it will become hotter. and the senses of the body will elevate and rise <br>  <br>  this is all perfectly  normal .|`|ERx11AsCaa	Im not sure if this will work however I know it works for sweaty feet. <br>  <br>  Take several tea bags and soak them in water. When the water has cooled down take the tea bags out and then soak your hands in the water. The tannic acid from the tea will dry out your hands and also will slow down the sweating process. Do this over several days.<br>  <br>  Also buy a non scented strong antiperspirant and spray your hands before you go out with your boyfriend. The antiperspirant is aluminum based and the aluminum blocks the sweat pores. <br>  <br>  Since sweating hands go hand in hand with being nervous, try taking some vitamin b or other vitamin which aids in reducing nervousness.

It all comes down to preference and which one you're willing to swallow.
7E5d2kMMaa	Keep it private for now, try becoming close to her and giving her a safe haven so to speak. you obviously can connect with her on this level but you cant force it or rat her out just yet that will only push her away and close the door for you to help. if she has no role model in her life you can become that person for her but you cant force it. keep an eye on her give her extra attention to make her feel comfortable and let her tell you at that point you can help her and give her your advice and at that point ask her if you can tell someone who can give her further help because you know how dangerous this can be. (share your experience so she feels you do understand her and that will build a trust and bound)<br>  <br>  you can't force her to tell you and you cant tell her you know or it will only make her feel  she cant trust anybody (specially the person that told you) and push her to go further with this sickness because it will make her feel she has some sort of control again. don't push her towards it get her to open up and then from that point help her as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  PS  Please think more about how you felt when you had the sickness, if you go straight to some sort of authority figure it will only make her feel attacked and ashamed that can make her do something even worse. Don't take the other people's advice, if your asking this question its because you know you need to help this child and you cant help her if she feels attacked and pushes you away.|`|JQjs3cB3aa	you need to tell someone who has responsibilty over her...if its that bad and you know the dangers you can't just stand by and watch her kill herself...even if you have to talk to her in the end|`|oDUTISsgaa	Report it. I am surprised however you need to ask this question. You acknowledged the problem, and the seriousness of it already.<br>  <br>  She will have someone in her life, unless she is over 18, meaning she is old enough to take responsibility of herself, at least in the eyes of the law.<br>  If the latter, you must drop slowly hints that she might like to get help, the first step to which is acknowledging that she has a problem. If under 18 then I believe she would be classed as a minor? Essentially she may be taken into care if whoever she is living with is found to not be looking after her properly, which may be seen as tantamount to serious neglect. Don't quote me on it.

EeTs9DqUaa	You need to have more tests run, per the American Diabetes Association the HbA1c test is not used to diagnose diabetes but is used to monitor how well you are controlled.  However there has to be a reason for the higher than normal A1c, your doctor should order a OGTT or oral glucose tolerance test.  This test takes about 3 hours to complete but will show if you have insulin resistance and will show what your glucose levels are after consuming a high carb meal.<br>  Type 2 diabetes biggest risk factor is family history, without the hereditary factor about the only other way to get it is a side affect of some drugs.|`|xoymj33Taa	My personal opinion, is a yes/no. You may have type 2 yes, but in most cases type 2 CAN be cured/taken care of without anything major. Im talking about diets, look up a variety of diets, I would personally suggest a vegan diet, do not be afraid to ask your doctor about this or challenge his opinions.|`|LJancLQ2aa	your blood glucose level is at the borderline of normal.. you may have got it through your genes.. and since you're just 16, and athletic, the manifestations may not have expressed themselves yet...|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Your A1C isn't that high, although it is borderline, but at this level I wouldn't expect a diagnosis of diabetes!  It is doubtful that you have type 2 diabetes, as you are young, fit and not overweight.  If frequent urination is your only symptom, this also means it is unlikely.  Did you eat 12 hours before your A1C test?  This can affect the results.<br>  <br>  Type 2 diabetes isn't normally hereditary, but type 1 is.<br>  <br>  I would question your doctor, and get regular tests done (get  a home blood monitoring machine, and check your levels before and 1 hour after eating for a few days).  He is probably just being on the safe side, but unless you sugar levels rocket, it is unlikely that you have diabetes. Try to keep to a healthy diet though, and cut out excess sugars!|`|8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	I would seek out a 2nd opinion.......<br>  <br>  Your first A1c was perfectly normal along with your blood sugar reading of 83mg/dl. I don't know why you were retested unless your doctor comes a different school of thought.<br>  <br>  As has been said an A1c is not a diagnostic test for diabetes.<br>  <br>  If that 2nd A1c of 6.2 was performed first then it would have been proper to do two follow up fasting blood sugars, the definitive test for diabetes. The 2nd test is always done to eliminate the possibility of a lab error.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question of "Is my doctor 100% right", my answer would be no at least not without follow up tests.<br>  <br>  You need to insist on a 2nd opinion.

Nuuk1Nwtaa	It's probably better to go to CVS or somewhere and get an actual mouthguard designed to prevent tooth grinding. You'll soak it in hot water until it softens, then bite it and wear it at night. DON'T use a sportsguard! It can mess up your jaw and is not designed to be worn like that.

t2R3mEMoaa	We are human beings, we think and we feel. That's what we do and that is who we are. We are not made to make quick and irrational decisions. We are to think things through and make the best possible choice, and take responsibility for that choice be it right or wrong. When the brain is overloaded it shuts down like any other organ, hence confusion. Like all organs in our body, over use requires rest. It is no different for our brains. Like our hearts which keep beating daily 24/7, our brains never stop working either. Rest and food are required to run this organ effectively. We really do take it for granted much of the time and we shouldn't. I have been and always will be a firm believer in good mental health first and everything else will work out. As thinkers, this is the one thing that absolutely no one can take from us without permission to do so and even then, no one knows what we are thinking ever!

c4ded2672a1b6461a7cf5ac2f327a09faa	I would suggest working out. If you work out it feels good, you relieve stress and release endorphins, which make you happy. I would suggest trying to find a kick boxing class or some kind of activity where you can hit objects and get a great body in return. There is a saying "look good feel good" well as simply as the saying is it is right. I always feel better when I'm working out. I have to convince myself everyday to exercise but I feel less stress and better in general.|`|VU7GTR91aa	Go running or get some sort of moderately intense excercise. This will release all the built up tension. Try some yoga and meditation to further relax yourself. Drink some relaxing herbal tea. Avoid caffeine. Take deep breaths. When something bothers you, take some deep breaths and remember that getting angry will only make you feel worse. Why let what others do wrong hurt you if you can help it?
CvN8klPWaa	Much depression is a chemical imbalance, ADD is a chemical imbalance, there are many mental diseases that are just chemical imbalances.<br>  They can be treated with medication and for many people it is not something that can be fixed without medication.<br>  In some instances the chemical imbalances can be caused by many factors. One of the most common is bad food problems which will not allow your body to receive the proper nutrition in order to produce the chemicals it needs.<br>  Another is being sick. Sometimes different sicknesses can cause your body not to produce the chemicals it needs.<br>  A third can be substance abuse. Drinking alcohol and doing drugs (recreational or prescription) can cause imbalances either short term or long term. Long term is Ecstacy (Adam) or Acid, which can sit in the brain and slowly release, which rotts the brain, over a period of decades. This also will not allow the body to produce or overproduce certain chemicals. <br>  Even enviroment can cause chemical imbalances. Stress from living in a high crime area can cause the body not to produce what it needs to relax and can cause depression, anxiety, etc.<br>  Also, physical fitness can cause imbalances. This works both ways; being unfit and being too fit. An underactive person may have problems because of glanular issues, lymph nodes not being used or producing enough stimulant, even diabetes is a chemical imbalance. Being too fit is bad as well. It can cause improper growth, gymnasts will sometimes not get their periods because of being 'too fit' and 'too much testosterone' which causes improper growth and other more serious issues.<br>  A proper diet can improve alot of the issues, and prescription drugs can solve some of the other issues, but even that may not always solve the issue.|`|AA11610448	It depends on what the imbalance is.  Some can be cured, some can't, some don't take to treatment.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	If it is a true chemical imbalance then the best one can hope for is treatment. One pill a day. It's a small price to pay considering the alternatives. I've been doing it for many years and will have to the rest of my life. Oh well! Today I have a healthy life and I am very grateful for this, believe me.|`|TT7qBVV4aa	I'm pretty sure they cannot be cured only treated.

Try and stick to soft foods for the first few days and follow any eating with the solution above, swishing to be sure all food particles are rinsed out of your mouth. Orajel is a numbing gel and may help slightly with the pain, but isn't meant to aid healing. If you keep it clean, it should feel better in a day or two.

SUCKER THE SURGEONS!<br>  <br>  6. MAKE THE MEDICS WORK FOR A LIVING!<br>  <br>  Cancer treatment costs too much, and is administered ALL WRONG.<br>  The Human body can take care of its cancers by itself- at no extra cost. This is achieved through FASTING.<br>  <br>  If a person practices fasting ten-to-fourteen days at a time, every three to six months, there are a host of diseases and conditions they will be UNABLE to contract. Western Medicine DEPENDS on our stuffing ourselves with TOO MUCH FOOD our bodies NO LONGER NEED.<br>  <br>  The average person will be utterly horrified at the idea they should go even more than three days without eating. A person could easily live out their entire lives and never go three days without eating even three square meals every day. This is extremely bad.<br>  <br>  The most fraudulent practice in medicine MUST be LIPOSUCTION.<br>  It killed one of our last president's First Ladies. If you don't want to be fat, STOP EATING. Now they are talking about putting tiny ROBOTS in the arteries, to scrape off the arterioslerosis. THIS IS OBSCENE!<br>  They KNOW the SIMPLE cure! But if people knew to do THAT, they would FIND OUT other things. So the public's minds are manipulated so they don't LEARN what they don't WANT us to learn.<br>  <br>  For instance, after THREE DAYS fasting, you DON'T feel hungry any more. The person who has never fasted thinks that as they might have gone a whole day without eating some time, "the poor starving person" who is trying to fast feels that sensation INCREASE every day!<br>  The truth is that after three days, the brain gets the message that gastric juice is no longer needed, and stop producing it.<br>  <br>  I have found that the medical people I have communicated with on this subject- and the people no doubt employed to throw people off the track online- play on your IGNORANCE if you DO not know ANYTHING anything FASTING. They will not TELL you what you don't know. For instance, I had one fellow on ezboard.com, who SAID he was a DOCTOR, tell me that the toxins released during fasting would KILL anyone who attempted it. I have belonged to a church where 40-day fasting was considered normal. NONE of us DIED.<br>  <br>  Anyone who knows anything about fasting knows that THIRSTING IS NOT FASTING. You have to drink up to 2 litres of water every day. This enables you to sweat, exhale, pee, and sh*t out ALL the toxins released when the fat content of your body starts to metabolize for the first time, after the third day (which is when your glycogen in depleted).<br>  <br>  People who never fasted in their lives, know how they crash if they don't get a carbohydrate "fix" before 9am. They THINK that this is how you will feel all through a fast, getting weaker and weaker and weaker... The first 10-14 days are crucial. This is when the body is adjusting to not having fresh food come in, and must start tapping its own on-board stocks- while having to excrete a VAST amount of toxic waste it has never been able to touch before, because the blood supply was largely tied up digesting regular meals.<br>  <br>  After that time, the body is quite used to its state, and has no toxins holding it back, and begins to be stronger and healthier than before the fast began. At this stage, pathogenic and harmless parasites begin to become food for the body. Cancer becomes food for the body, and is replaced with healthy tissue. The skin looks younger. Scar tissue disappears, to be replaced by baby-like new skin. Grey hair starts growing out with its old colour again. MEDICAL SCIENCE DOES NOT WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW ABOUT THESE EFFECTS.<br>  <br>  You CANNOT rely on Western Doctors for HELP in fasting. THEY WILL MESS YOU UP. It is their TRAINING. If you have some deadly condition- like heart trouble, diabetes, liver failure, LONG fasting would PROBABLY cure you, IF you survived it- but it is more likely to KILL you. If you have severe organic failure, it is TOO LATE for fasting to help you without help from people who REALLY care about YOU- not your money. If you had such a condition, and wanted to use fasting to cure yourself, you would probably have to rest in bed and never move for the duration. <br>  <br>  The alimentary canal shuts down after three days without food.<br>  It becomes IMPOSSIBLE to resume eating without considerable discipline and patience, in only drinking OVER-diluted fruit juices as meals thefirst three days or so, and very gradually going back to normal eating. It is far better to go "too slowly" than too quickly.<br>  <br>  I once took a "cabbage" soup after I fasted ten days, and started peeing blood and crystals that nearly became stones. I thought I knew what I was doing. I did not follow the proper procedure! <br>  I quickly recovered- and never felt any pain- but I know a pastor who died the seventh day of fasting- but he never drank water, and was just doing it to show off. he refused to listen to my a
xoymj33Taa	This is actually something that happened to me before I knew much about it. When your asleep you go into whats called REM sleep, and your body becomes (for the most part) paralyzed. Before I knew much about this, I would always wake up scared etc., but I eventually found out about this REM stage of sleep, and Lucid Dreaming. Pretty much, my body would fall asleep but my mind wouldn't (and i just wouldn't recall this or pass it off as a dream), this could be what is happening to you, and what I found the best way to fix this is simply learn lucid dreaming. It is simply the ability to control your dreams during REM sleep. It will also teach you about the before mentioned paralyze etc. etc.|`|N9LQG5u3aa	Your being brave and looking for cookies :)

YQ9YXcEkaa	First, Hodgkin's Disease is a fairly rare cancer.  There are only about 8,000 cases diagnosed each year in the US, so hopefully you don't have it.  If you do, however, Hodgkin's Disease is one of the most curable kinds of cancer.  It is almost always treated with chemotherapy, sometimes with the addition of radiation therapy.<br>  <br>  The most common Hodgkin's symptom is a painlessly enlarged lymph node, usually in the neck or collarbone area (the collarbone area would be very suspicious for lymphoma).  Lymph nodes enlarged from Hodgkin's tend to be non-tender, rubbery, firm, and enlarge fairly slowly.  Hodgkin's Disease commonly starts in the chest (mediastinum) so it can often be seen there on a chest imaging (x-ray or CT scan) even before symptoms develop.<br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease "B-symptoms" are drenching night sweats, fever, and weight loss of 10% or more.  Some patients have these, others do not.  They really don't necessairly correlate with having advanced disease; I didn't have any official B-symptoms and I was stage IV.  Other associated Hodgkin's symptoms include a cough (from a chest mass), intense itching, and, classically, pain when drinking alcohol.<br>  <br>  Unexplained bruising could be a sign of Hodgkin's, but its not a common symptom.  I had that as a symptom, though, it usually means you have a low platelet count.  My main symptoms were an abdominal mass, easy bruising, itching, light night sweats, and a very bad cough.  <br>  <br>  Hodgkin's can only be definitively diagnosed with a biopsy.  I was diagnosed in 2007 with stage IV Hodgkin's.  It was in my liver, spleen, chest, and neck.  I was treated with 8 months of chemotherapy and I have been in remission since.  <br>  <br>  If you turn out to have Hodgkin's, here are some excellent links where you can learn more:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/hodgkinsdisease" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.gov/hodgkinsdisease</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lymphomainfo.net/hodgkins" rel="nofollow">http://www.lymphomainfo.net/hodgkins</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mdanderson.org/diseases/hodgkins/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdanderson.org/diseases/hodgk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.lymphoma.com/" rel="nofollow">http://forums.lymphoma.com/</a>|`|2Y9pejG6aa	The main symptoms are having a painless lump in lymph nodes - ie neck, collarbone or groin commonly, and fatigue. Some people get itchy skin, but it is less common.  Constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats and fevers are termed B symptoms, and they use the presence or absence of these symptoms to stage the cancer - these symptoms usually appear when it is more advanced.  It is better to not have B symptoms, and it sounds like you don't.  Good luck.|`|10a75ee0424e1f57ac73550ada2b49deaa	tumor in neck lymph nodes, chronic fatigue, loss of weight, loss of appetite.

That is why the mojority are diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma, because the lymph node it growing too big and uncomfortable.<br>  Night sweat, fever and weight loss are also symptoms but mostly only at a really advansted stage.<br>  The next most common symptom is deep skin itches.<br>  I'm not sure if bruises are a sign though, that indicates anemia and a low platelet count which is a symptom of leukemia.

db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	Yes, that's what happens when you start your period... you started if you got that "stuff" down there. At your age, periods won't start turning red for a while... it varies with all women!!!  My daughter is verrrrry close to starting her period and she wears panty liners just in case.. even though she doesn't NEED to because the discharge won't be very much.. she just wants to get used to them.. it's just her thing.<br>  <br>  If you've had that dark brownish discharge, you've started! It should go away here soon. Next month.. you'll start again and it will most likely be brownish again. Keep track of your periods too!! Oh and, you'll eventually get pains as all women do when the periods become more regular! You can go on for months before they're regular after you first start.. all girls are different though. I suggest you talk with a female like your mom or a girl friend or someone you feel comfortable talking with about this that is well experienced.<br>  <br>  4 days into this is perfectly okay.<br>  You should get your period every month from now on if you just started. Periods don't go away unless you're pregnant or your on a certain birth control pill or you have a hysterectomy!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.<br>  Welcome to womanhood!!!|`|U28zWej3aa	I think your starting on your period.<br>  Carry on wearing the pads..<br>  <br>  & I don't think all the girls have cramps.<br>  Even I don't.<br>  You might have them on the next period though. It varies from girl to girl. Some don't have pains at all.<br>  <br>  It being a brownish color is alright<br>  It might change to red next period.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|lJztPGEjaa	wear pads anyway sumtyms the blood on your period can be brown i usually get brown blood at the end of my period or a couple of days before keep the date in mind where you first noticed it because all people are different and this mite be the start of ur period if it is your period ul come on around the sme time next month id put a pad on just for comformt anyway|`|wJ7HDlzRaa	Your most likely starting on your period <br>  You should carry on wearing the pads just in case you come on<br>  and not all girls have pains either, I don't<br>  Good Luck (:|`|iFTa9FqZaa	thats your period. Sometimes it just is more of a brownish color than red. It may turn red next period. My first period I didn't have cramps, and some girls just don't get cramps all together.|`|GPNF7Ds7aa	yer defs your period...it can be the starting of it so just watch it my discharge slowly chnaged colours then eventurally got there so just make sure you are preapere..<br>  <br>  XD goodluck
a8mQuc4iaa	we've known for a long long long time i think going back to the stone ages that we needed stiches or bandages to prevent too much bleeding <br>  yes we do if a cut is very deep its possible to bleed to death the stitches prevents this by "fixing" the wound|`|PFCfKKtSaa	Yes we do. Stitches help it heal. It keeps it protected and makes it heal more faster.<br>  <br>  Before stitches and doctors, it would most probably be left open getting infected, which can lead to serious illnesses, ones where you'd probably need that area amputated, which would of been another thing they wouldn't of known, therefore leading to death.|`|pYzOZP3Xaa	Well before we had stitches the wound would get infected and go gangrene and drop off, so yes we do really need stitches so the wound can heal and stay clean!
H3giw4QHaa	I would definitely talk to your mom or another adult about this.  If she isn't lying, than she was basically raped, if she is lying you need to let her mom know what she's saying because she may "lie" to the wrong person one day and someone could get in a lot of trouble.|`|qitXGd0qaa	I agree with most of the other answers you've already received, but just wanted to add a little bit more.<br>  <br>  At 10 years old, its unlikely that she ovulates (releases an egg from her ovary) regularly. <br>  <br>  In addition, unless she looks much older and is completely physically developed and her mother lied about her age and I don't think a gynecologist could be fooled that a 10 year old was actually 14-15 years old. At age 10 if her mom took her to get an abortion, I think the doctor would report it to the police. I think in all states it is illegal to have sex with a child under the age of 13 regardless of consent.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to stop being friends with this girl. It sounds as if she has some psychological issues. It isn't cool or normal to be 10 years old and lie about being pregnant and getting an abortion. She'll probably always have alot of drama and untrue situations going on during her life.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	no i don't believe that story   load of rubbish what she told you ,,,, if you no her mom ask her ,,, alot of you girls lie at the time at the age ,,,it part of growing up for them  ... they have baby at 13 ,,,  playing with themselves , the list go on ..they love to invented thing up..|`|RW6Ja6eeaa	Well, if the story IS true, then that's really serious. She was raped, and if her BF was older than 18 (which is likely, because how else would she be pregnant?) than it's a crime. Tell a parent. I highly doubt that this is true and her mum let her get an abortion. I mean really, does this girl even have her period?\<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|8GcXSResaa	that's a lie. if this whole conversation hap pend in a course of three days then that's a lie. and wats a ten year old doin with a bf?? wtf|`|AQR3J7FHaa	shes 10? thats a totall liee. Plus her mom would not just get her an abortion like that...and shes 10. She shouldnt have a bf!|`|dgCC8xqZaa	To tell you the truth i'm not sure but shemight i'd have her to a doctor.
AA12256470	Not at all! I've actually heard people say that those who sing live longer. As long as you feel fine, sing as much as you like. :}|`|IHw2qUtcaa	As long as your throat doesn't seem strained then its fine.
NOAPRIz5aa	A combination of blurred vision and thrush are classic symptoms of diabetes, along with thirst and excessive peeing.  I cannot say regarding the other pains you mention but I don't believe they are generally symptomatic of diabetes.  Your very best next move is to delay no longer but go see your doctor asap and have yourself checked out.  If you do have symptoms of any diseases/illnesses, then the sooner you get a diagnosis the sooner you can begin treatment.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Thrush just comes when your body is out of sorts, so discount that in any diagnosis.  You should see a doctor to rule out any major condition.  However, there is a very high chance that all tests will come back normal.  That is both good and bad.  You can relax in terms of worries about serious illness, but it doesn't help you get better.  The most likely diagnosis is that you are suffering from some kind of chronic fatigue condition, or that it is psychological.  Now I just don't buy the psychological bit, but that's what doctors say when they don't know what it is.  For the muscle and joint pains try cherry active capsules.  Just google it for details.  The abdominal pain is likely to be irritable bowel syndrome.  There are various ways of easing the pain.  Do some research.<br>  <br>  You probably won't get much help from the doctors over this and will have to work it out yourself.  While you are doing what you can to ease the symptoms, consider trying the following.  If this is indeed your problem, it will give you a cure, but it doesn't work quickly and requires perseverance.  Here's a link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maul.samara.ru/~paracels/" rel="nofollow">http://maul.samara.ru/~paracels/</a><br>  <br>  It seems a bit batty but I am convinced by the science behind it.  Ignore all the references to old people.  They are just trying to market it that way, but the instructions cater for all ages, including children. <br>  <br>  The symptoms will go one at a time, not all together. <br>  <br>  There is a good chance that low carbon dioxide is your problem and that is what this device cures.  But before going down that route, you must have every test the medical profession recommends to make sure there is no other condition.
IFotQ6kBaa	Its probably not a really bad migraine becuz migraines kill you feel like your useless and you get really impatient with anyone and anything ,I hat e igraines I take ibuprofen for my migraines and EVERYTHING else, I had kidney stones twice and im only 13 and i took ibuprofen on my way to the er the second time and the pain went away within 20 minutes or so.|`|jKdVtDx7aa	A migraine is much more intense. It can be make you totally dysfunctional. It will make you very sensitive to light and to noise.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	not a migraine.. you probably just had a headache or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  this is a migraine:<br>  <br>  picture a sledge hammer, now picture it being smacked into your head spilling your brains all over the floor.  that is how a migraine feels.
NfPuCUceaa	First you suddenly become braver. You talk to people you wouldn't dare. You get happier.<br>  Then if you drink more, you start to lose your balance. And you can't feel anything you touch (that's the coolest i think). You do things you wouldn't do sober. Depends on you, mostly.<br>  When you lie down on the bed, you feel sick, like you're on a boat. If you sleep enough, the next day won't be that bad. But don't stay up for the whole night when you're drunk, cause you will have a very bad day when you wake up.|`|V4jYQcJZaa	Yes. <br>  Maybe, depends. <br>  I would think so. I didn't have any problems.|`|olMCJaNwaa	yeah, your eyes go funny and you feel hyper and happier. if you only drink enough to be happy you'll be ok in the morning, maybe a bit shakey but you'll just need food.<br>  <br>  if you continue drinking to the point where you don't know what your doing you'll feel like hell in the morning, and you'll probably be sick on the night..maybe in the morning too. <br>  <br>  drinking's good as long as you stop before you're sick. that way your happy, a bit daft and giggly. but if you're depressed and drink you'll probably end up drinking to much snd feeling worse.

I love to roll play,like I am taking control of others.|`|pYzOZP3Xaa	It is totally normal to get turned on by domination, you know its not real so there's no harm in it, you can even encorporate it into love making. It is only when you take the fantasy literally that it becomes dangerous!|`|dhJdAPn4aa	Dont worry, I know what you mean.<br>  >_><br>  Its normal and everyone has different types of fetishes and fantasies.|`|0KGJRVMNaa	I don't think you're "wrong" or "disgusting".<br>  I am the same way, plus I'm a little bit of a pervert but it's all good.<br>  <br>  LOL|`|NfPuCUceaa	Well, first of all: what does normal mean?<br>  I don't want to be ****** normal, that's for sure.|`|nolxYfzUaa	Just shows that you are dominating.  Long as you don't act on it.  Could be dangerous.|`|sNNRQxhOaa	ewwwwww wat
ZbMLigR3aa	Your best answer will come from a gynecologist hon.  If you feel like your menstrual cycle is not coming on as regularly as it once did and you've been getting it for two years, seeing a doctor is the best option.  He or she will be able to evaluate you based on your medical history and an examination.  Beyond that, if you have gone through any major stresses or weight gains or losses, this could have caused your period to go off its normal pattern too.  I hope you get this sorted out painlessly and quickly.  Good luck!

8huPzOKHaa	i've pierced my own ears about three times. it's very simple and not even that painful or dangerous if you do it correctly.<br>  an earring itself is not sharp enough. i found that safety pins and sewing needles work best.<br>  <br>  1. sterilize the needle you are using with either rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or something to that extent. do the same thing to earring and your ear itself.<br>  <br>  2. wash your hands thoroughly and dry them well.<br>  <br>  3. take the needle and push it through the part of your ear you want pierced as fast and hard as you can. if you do it quickly it won't hurt as bad, but if you do it all slow because you are scared, it will hurt a lot worse.<br>  <br>  4. if you want, take an ice cube to your ear lobe before you pierce it. leave it on there for a few minutes and it will be pretty numb. you shouldn't feel it hardly at all.<br>  <br>  5. once the needle is through, take it out and put in the earring as quick as you can.<br>  <br>  tips:<br>  -make sure you clean your ears everyday at least twice. use the same thing you used to sterilize the needle. or most jewelry stores have ear cleaner that you can buy for about $5-10.<br>  <br>  -when you pierce it, your ear shouldn't bleed. don't worry if it does though, it just means you hit a small vein. it's not a big deal, your not going to die. you could leave it in if you want, but when that happens to me i usually take it out and re-pierce it a few days later after the initial piercing has mostly healed.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|2UDbOpxTaa	I would use a needle, as earrings are a bit blunt. Make sure you sterilise the needle first by putting it in boiling water, and do the same with the earring you are going to put in (which should be gold or titanium). Wash your hands and your ear really well.<br>  <br>  In the old days they used to so the "needle and soap" trick, where you put a bar of soap underneath the back of the earlobe, then push the needle through until it goes into the soap.<br>  <br>  And remember to clean it twice a day for at least the first 3 weeks.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	No, too blunt.  If you want to do it yourself.  A not to thin hypodermic needle, disinfectant, ice, and a cork.  Freeze the lobe with the ice and push the needle through the ear (after dipping it in the disinfectant) against the cork held at the back of your ear lobe.  Put in a circular earring and keep turning it regularly.  Watch out for infection.<br>  Peace.|`|tERrqwzaaa	you actually can!<br>  i did it, sterilised it first though<br>  i pushed it throwugh, and it pops when it goes half way, then push it through again and voila :D<br>  you gotta be quite like okay with it though, push it really hard really quickly :D<br>  ive got 3 in each ear, i ddi 4 myself, none got infected, ive had them for about a year now :)<br>  good luck<br>  xo|`|AHHAGxlCaa	no - it would be really painful, get infected and be a silly idea<br>  <br>  get it done properly

0TT5q0cUaa	The vocal chords are small thin muscles that vibrate when air passes through them thus producing sound. One can improve the quality of voice by some simple techniques like breathing correctly, breath control, having a proper posture, pitch etc. You can refer to the following site:<br>  <br>  www.vocalist.org.uk/voicetraining.html
CnGR2xeoaa	Panic or anxiety attacks are frightening but usually harmless. It sounds like this is what you are having. Panic attacks are usually brought on by some type of external stress, it would be good to take inventory of your life and find out where this stress is coming from. It also sounds, with all do respect, as if you get stressed pretty easy. Perhaps try some calming exercises, try meditation, take a long hot bath with candlelight, go for a massage or do all of the above. <br>  It's also a good idea to refrain from caffeine or energy drinks for a while. If you're taking any medications find out if they might be the cause.<br>  Use caution regarding anti-anxiety medications if prescribed as overuse or abuse can actually make your symptoms worse.|`|nolxYfzUaa	It does sound like you are having a panic attack.  If your physical was fine, then make an appointment with someone that you can talk to about why you are having these attacks, and why you feel that you need medical help.  Straining to yawn could mean that your body is just releasing adrenaline.  You may need some medication to help you not be so stressed.  Good luck and please find someone to talk with.|`|yBgRDe9Vaa	Well, I don't really know, since the docs say you are OK.  Could be you are giving yourself anxiety attacks through worry or bad dreams.  If you are having breathing problems in your bronchial tubes, eat more brocolli...opens them up.  And go to Wal-Mart vitamin/herb section and try Echinacea-Golden Seal Complex, which supports your respitory and immune system health.  All worth a try and won't hurt ya.  For stress/nerves also pick up some Vitamin B6...maybe your body's low on it, and it will calm you down; or try chamomile herbal tea for the same.  You could just be having all those hormone changes that happen at your age when turning into a young man.  Smile now...you'll get through it, so don't panic!

ZjhQ6PL8aa	Palpitations are caused by several things from stress to heart failure sometimes the causes are simply unknown.  While I would never want to contradict your doctor I've personally never read any research stating a correlation between THC and AF.  All though THC may be related to the palpitations.  I have however seen evidence that alcohol is linked to AF.  Anything more then a drink or 2 can put excessive strain on the body especially the liver and you can't live without that.  <br>  <br>  On a side note if your losing friends cause you don't smoke weed then lets be honest those people were never really your friend to begin with as friends don't do that to each other.

You'll have to double check me on the details, but here's what i do.<br>  1) Trim the pubic hairs with hair scissors. Get the hairs as close to the skin as possible, be careful not to cut yourself.<br>  2) Get a shower and wash thoroughly down there.<br>  3) Dry yourself completely.<br>  4) Use shaving cream and shave in the same direction as the hair.<br>  5) If all the hair isn't gone put more shaving cream on and shave against the direction of the hair.<br>  6) Rinse yourself off and make sure to dry!(If it's too wet down there you could get a yeast infection)<br>  7) Put some kind of soothing lotion on, made especially for after shaving the vagina<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|OwQsCR4Saa	i believe that is a razor burn.|`|lzp70MlZaa	That my dear is razer burn.

They are normal because that area is very sensitive. Make sure when shaving you're using some sort of shaving cream and warm water. It'll make shaving easier as well as cut down on the bumps if you're still insistent on using a razor.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	they are ingrown hairs, ways to prevent that are shaving down not against the hair, applying lotion, and using hydrocortisone cream helps|`|EtgHIoNHaa	Yes that's normal everyone get's it.<br>  Completley normal it's from shaving .|`|SlLnu8u9aa	yeah that because you use a razor, there are hair shavers exclusively for that body area to keep that from happening|`|a0MgkDk0aa	They're not pimples, it's your pores reacting to the shave!!!|`|AA10276558	they are ingrown hairs<br>  the hair gets stuck in the folicle (shaft) <br>  and you get a 'pimple'
zQohPPH9aa	Eat 4 or 5 meals a day instead of 3 meals. For example, never eat more than 300 calories at one meal. This will give you a total of 1200 - 1500 calories per day. Weight loss is more about portion size and eating often than anything else.<br>  <br>  Jenny Craig and the others make frozen meals with less than 300 calories. However, you can find many other cheaper brands like Healthy Choice at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  NEVER drink anything other than water, tea, or coffee. No added sugar or milk.<br>  <br>  SLEEPING:  Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.<br>  Never sleep more than 8 hours.  This is 5 90-min sleep cycles.  When you are awake, you burn more calories.  Sleep 10-6, 11-7, or 12-8, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, eat fresh fruit and vegetables instead of processed/canned foods.<br>  Try not cooking the fruits and vegetables. They are much better for you RAW.<br>  <br>  Crunches would definitely help.

GoABmevnaa	This is actually pretty normal when you first start eating healthy along with an exercise routine, especially if you were pretty sedentary beforehand. Also, if you were pretty overweight to start, you will lose weight faster.<br>  When I first started my "new and healthy lifestyle" I lost 15 pounds in 1 month, but after that it got harder and harder to lose weight... and now I wish I was back at losing weight faster.<br>  Just enjoy it for now and it will slow down!|`|hXehbPVqaa	were you pretty over weight when you started? people who are over weight and haven't done much for ages and start to exercise and eat right loss weight very fast.<br>  <br>  ever seen the show biggest loser?? i am from Australia i don't know if you have it there....<br>  <br>  they loss like 6 kg in a week!!!<br>  <br>  but for a smaller person it is harder you should be only losing no more then 2 too 3kg at the most a week.<br>  <br>  but dont stop doing what you are doing if you feel good|`|HL0KTJw4aa	no , that's not a bad amount to lose  <br>  however if you are concerned you could consult your doctor|`|7s5OU7Sxaa	almost everyone who loses weight that doesn't do the proper amount of strength training to retain or slow muscle loss will lose as much muscle as fat(if not more). every lb of muscle loss is about 35cals less  a day your body will need to maintain weight. a lb of fat only uses about 4cals just by existing.(i might be off a little on my numbers but this is still scientific fact). <br>  so when you go off you diet you will need less calories to maintain a bodyweight.<br>  i lost 30lbs in 5 months and only did strength training and still  10lbs of my loss was muscle.which is 350cals less a day i can eat to maintain weight.(plus just 80more from 20lbs of fat loss=430cals less i can eat to keep from regaining weight)<br>  btw. i ate 1300 to 1500cals every day for 5months and i was hungry each and every day. i just got use to it after the 1st. month.now i can eat about 2200cals to maintain my weight.
AA10766729	You're probably fine, but if it would put your mind at ease, then by all means, take a pregnancy test.  Stress -- either conscious or unconscious -- about pregnancy can actually delay a period.  Getting a negative test result will probably settle your nerves.<br>  <br>  Know too that a lot of times when first starting the pill, it is quite normal to skip your first period.  Start your next pack on time, and if you skip another period, contact your doctor.|`|c8lBbWtQaa	It takes time for your body to adjust to all the hormones so you might not have a proper period for a couple of months & some people seem to be more sensitive & their periods all but dissapear especially if they were light to start with give it 3 months then check with your dr if things are the same.As for being pregnant it is unlikely if you have followed the instructions properly the pill works well trust it.|`|H3giw4QHaa	My gyno always informed me that you should use protection for the first 2 months of using birth control, to make sure its in full effect.  I don't know if you're pregnant or not, if it makes your mind calmer go ahead and take one, but it may read wrong since you're suppose to start.  Sometimes your period won't start until the first last reminder.  If you spotted early on, your birth control may not be strong enough.  I would call the doctor and ask to speak to his/her nurse.  Let them know whats going on.|`|Ng6Lfnskaa	i dont know|`|Kau1bDxZaa	First Off. I was on on the same pill and never had a period.So really, you  have nothing to worry about.<br>  2nd- It depends when you started the pill. If you started taking the pill the first day of your period, You are protected. If not, I would wait up to 3 wks to be completly sure you are covered.<br>  <br>  For now, Take a pregnancy test to double check. Other then that, not having a period is a very common side effect of this paticular pill.<br>  enjoy it! lol

It should not hinder your weight loss if done IN moderation and of course it depends on what you drink,  A lite beer has 96 cal And zero fat And less than one carb, red wine contrary to popular belief is less fattening than white. Vodka has almost ZERO calories, drink it on the rocks or with club soda.  Try a good ole martini if you are out for a good time.

However, the faster you get the papers the faster it will help you with scripts and medical cost and all that stuff.  Good luck.  Some are slow about helping folks.

fPbjSNEHaa	There is no set limit for calories allowed. You need a minimum of 1200 per day for core bodily functions and any extra you use should be combatted with exercise.<br>  <br>  Calorie counting as boring as it sounds is not the most ideal way to lose weight. First of all different quantities of food have different amounts of calories and some foods have other nutrients that are also required in your daily diet. Calorie counting can be extremely restrictive and can also become obsessive too, so be warned.<br>  <br>  Losing 1lb a week is very simple if you do it the right way. Just keep exercising and cut back on unnecessary snacking and process foods, sugary drinks and saturated fats. Keep hydrated too, drink enough water.|`|MF9YknDYaa	There is almost no real evidence that cutting calories will reduce weight in the long term,if it were true why don't fat people(who need more calories than skinny people)just reduce their intake a little and lose weight?.
t2R3mEMoaa	This is quite normal especially after you've already put your day in. It's called fatigued and you should try getting another hour or two of sleep at night. At least your not walking into walls yet or forgot why you went to another area of the house. When this starts to happen then you have reached what we like to call, middle age! Relax, your worrying will give you an ulcer. Depending on your age you should be getting at least 10 hours of sleep and lack of it can cause a great deal of changes in our bodies/minds. Good mental health|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Maybe you just need to get out amongst other people more often so that you are not continually internalising, thinking and talking (mutely) to yourself.

rLsphyqhaa	Do you walk to class? Do you go out to eat? if yes to those then you make the best of it during those times. Instead of walking run, jog to and from each. Get a bike and ride it to your classes if they are of any distance. If need be take off a little earl so you get here in time. You have to sleep at times so when you get ready for bed make it a point to do some sit ups, leg lifts, run in place. then take a shower relax. Granted working out just before bed time will get you hear rater up but it will also take away some of the stress. It is going to take time but once you get into a routine of it all things wil get into place.|`|8c91cd41995861eb50ee3ac0353a8ec3aa	well, try to involve physical activity when studying... im sure you must study a lot right?... well, maybe like do some push-ups while your reading, or start jogging to classes. Maybe even on your breaks get some of your work done so you have a little more time at night.... im sure you might not be able to workout EVERYday but every other day or even 3 days a week is a good start till your school semester is done with.

Guess what? When I got a little older (40ish) they started to get thin.Was that the baking soda? I am not sure. I tend to think it was the baking soda . Now they are so thin that I am going to have to have veeners put on them. I did ask a dentist one time about it and he said that b. soda is no more abrasive then some toothpastes so you use your own judgement. But one fact I do know; it did whiten my teeth and I brushed the same amount of time I did for toothpaste; about a minute or a little more.

HD29O7Ataa	It's all situational. What kind of fracture is it? Did they hit their head on the way down (if they did, we've got a ton of other problems to deal with)? WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE FAINTING? Any medical history? Stroke history? Age? How long has he/she been down? I could go on forever. Like I said, it's all situational.<br>  <br>  I'd check their ABC's. Airway/Breathing/Circulation. If something's wrong with the ABC's, screw the broken leg, that won't immediately affect their life.<br>  If it's simply syncope (fainting), then I'd take appropriate measures to treat the broken leg. <br>  It can't hurt elevating the unaffected leg. <br>  <br>  Once again, it depends on the situation. I'd probably really look hard into why the fainting occurred, ensure vitals are okay, and then treat the leg. <br>  Where I run calls we have 5 or 6 people on a scene like this! 2 on an ambulance and 3 or 4 on a fire engine. <br>  In reality here's what would happen<br>  1: Obtaining information and history<br>  1 or 2: Obtaining vital signs<br>  1 or 2: Treating leg<br>  1 or 2 treating the fainting<br>  <br>  Reality is a lot different than the textbook way of doing things.

JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.

AA10478980	Often having a six pack does make your chest look wider.  But it also depends on your genetics, and working your chest and shoulder and arm muscles as well.
72iZuDjeaa	sure, but targeting with an ab routine is doing the most beneficial effect on your abs of course,,,|`|nGkCWpRVaa	you can have a six pack i'll have the whole carton
Y3ghamr7aa	Yea they are very good for you!<br>  <br>  Just not too much of them.<br>  Too much of anything is bad.|`|ALUI34Qsaa	I have used every diet known to mankind but nothing worked as good as acai berry.  I understand they say that pills will not work, however they certainly worked for me, and they have been showcased on CNN too. There is a free trial going on currently at <a href="http://cugams.nuntanoastra.net" rel="nofollow">http://cugams.nuntanoastra.net</a> , why not check it out, how worse could it make things?
4sr1Mn7yaa	just eat regular foods. stay away from fast foods for a while. try to eat three meals a day.more salads with your meals. 6-8 glasses of water a day. try eating more fruits in place of sweets. try eating meals before 5:00 or 7:00P.M. And try some walking just around the neighborhood. playing basketball.that's what I do. I've lost 20lbs.|`|8fysRQecaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to consume less food and workout more, the problems surface when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are lots of temptations in the big wide world don't you think?! The one diet which clearly worked for me was green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost 25 pounds, it clearly does work!
3jFm0rWdaa	All these issues are up to the individual beliefs of the chiropractor, and basically have nothing to do with chiropractic care.  But if they want to give this kind of advice that's up to them and OK.<br>  But the only real thing Chiropractors HAVE to believe is that spinal misalignments cause pressure on nerves leading to other health problems including pain but a variety of other possible problems - if they don't believe that they aren't Chiropractors.

Within a couple of days it will start to help. The thing is it takes about a month to get use to sleeping with it so the effects are negated.
BlMNm9Ccaa	Thats funny, devdog thinks fat can convert to muscle. Any health nut (his words) can tell you that you cannot turn fat into anything. You can however, burn this fat away using a combination of exercise and a healthy diet. The weight watchers point system is just an easy way for you to keep track of what you eat. You are not losing water weight when you follow this plan. His last sentence is the only one that makes sense...eat right and work out...ww can help with that.<br>  <br>  Sounds from your info above that you are on the right track. The only advice I would have would be to increase the intensity of your work-outs, the amount of time that you do them, or the number of days per week that you exercise. You can do this gradually over a period of time if needed, just don't over do it. Good luck!!|`|BGRaT8jTaa	Yes...you are half way there but you are feeding into a scam that millions have become victoms to. Any health nut who works out daily will tell you, Theres no such thing as a magic diet that will help you lose weight...this includes weight watchers and all that other hoopla. Just make sure you increase your protien intake with chicken and fish while cutting back your cholesterol intake to include fried foods and greasy stuff....I'm here to tell you...the pipe dream is your belief that cutting back to small meals, nutrition bars and that sought of nonsene is the way to go. If you do this, you will lose lots of weight, however, the deception is that you will lose water weight and not fat...the water weight always comes back when you stop working out.. The name of the game is not really to lose weight but to convert fat into muscle...therefore, your focus should be on improving your cardiovascular by making the conversion. Eat hardy and workout hardy...thats the name of the game...if you feel and look good doing what you do, you will feel and look even better if you do what I'm telling you to do. I'm 42 years old and I look like I'm 25...I can run 5 miles at the drop of a hat...the other posters are selling you crap...you don't  need to spend money...just eat right and work out...
Mwb5UkPBaa	I think that most of the youth brings a positive contribution. Many of us just want to help and do our part. Which I think is reassuring to the older folks.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Where I am from (UK), youths get a bad rap, mainly due to "hoodies" and "yobs" which admittedly are usually young people themselves. But they only make up a small proportion of young people. I am a young person (well I hope I am, I'm only twenty) and I have never been in a gang, never carried a knife, never beaten anyone up, never vandalised anything, never stood on street corners shouting and swearing. And it hurts when the media bangs on about "the youth of today" and how society has never been worse. Young people today are tomorrows doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, police officers, vets, whatever. Some people forget that.
fYMWDQLGaa	feb usually is the coldest month of the year, and prolly u r experiencing severe cold followed by cough. <br>  <br>  take benadryl , it will sure help you. <br>  <br>  if its gets worse consult doctor.|`|UrMFmyC5aa	Visit immediately the nearest clinic to your place, for proper medication. Avoid self meditation. Intake more warm liquid and avoid any cold drinks. Take a rest and sleep on time.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Ehhhh...I'm not sure. Don't eat fried or cold foods often, it'd make your cough worse. Drink warm water.....|`|DHuYuzQ1aa	I would put my personal affairs in order.

xWYKqcDjaa	Blades are sold in cartridges, anywhere that they sell razors. (target, walmart, giant, etc.)<br>  <br>  I think venus razors are relatively expensive, though. Mine, I always forget to change the blade. I usually just look at it every once in a while and if it looks kinda dull, less shiny, or just gross, i'll either throw it away or change it. Usually once a month.<br>  <br>  Change the blades, not get a whole new razor. Its cheaper and better for the environment :)|`|2VO4dc30aa	when the razor gets to the point you have to go <br>  over your leg more than once or its not as sharp.<br>  you can get them anywhere... walmart cvs walgreens kroger.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	When your razor starts to rust, or you find that you don't get a close enough shave anymore, then you know to change it.<br>  <br>  You can either buy a new razor, or if your current one has disposable heads, you can buy some new ones, so you don't have to buy the whole razor. You can find both in basically any drug store or grocery store.|`|pjYQhPPBaa	I've heard depending on how much you shave, the blade should be changed every 2 weeks. Since it's every other day, this sounds about right. Eventually the blade will go dull, hair will build up, and the built in moisturizer will be gone. (I go about a month during the winter because I shave once or twice a week.)<br>  <br>  Venus blades usually cost around $10-15$ for a pack of 5 I think. They don't come in singles. You can get them just about any convenience store like CVS, Walmart, or even your local grocery store. You can always get disposable razors in a pack of 10 that have 1 blade for about $5, but they're not worth using daily unless you're going on a trip.
AuvMZYTSaa	If smoked properly, no<br>  <br>  Cigarettes are smoked strictly as a nicotine delivery system.  Filler has added chemicals, including additional nicotine.  Bleached paper and fiberglass filler.  It is meant to be inhaled.<br>  <br>  Cigars are smoked for flavor and aroma.  Premium cigars are handrolled with tobacco leaves for the filler, binder and wrapper.  The exception ois flavored/scented cigars where they have oils added.  They are NOT meant to be inhaled.<br>  <br>  This is relatively speaking - cigar smoking is not without its health issues.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	No but smoking cigars  makes you look like someone who like large things in their mouth.|`|BAbSXH6faa	obviously, smoking cigars/cigarillos is worse than smoking cigarettes, because there is no filter!! IT's true, you can get either mouth or lung cancer from both. If you wanna smoke cigars/cigarillos, I would suggest just puffing them, or at least very rarely. You can still get mouth cancer from doing it often though.|`|CDRjggikaa	You get a choice of cancer with each type..either mouth,or lung.
bgJzeHIdaa	Your period definitely shouldn't be lasting this long. You need to tell a parent/guardian and they need to schedule you a doctor's appointment. My longest period was the average 7 days and I know for a fact that it isn't normal for a period to last this long.|`|y1gsXEwOaa	The first time I had it, it lasted for almost two weeks.<br>  It started slowing down after a week, and stopped.<br>  There must be something wrong.<br>  You should probably tell your parents or call a doctor.<br>  Good luck :)|`|kknSPYxKaa	Don't worry. :)<br>  You have nothing to worry about, you just started your period. <br>  Your period takes 3-4 years to become regular.  I have had mine for almost two years now and mine is still not regular.<br>  Sometimes you will get a super long one (and you think it is never going to end), or sometimes you will get a really short one (you might not even notice you had it.) and other times you could have a really late one, or in fact, skip a month or have two in one month!  Doesn't that sound crazy?<br>  So in a nut shell, don't worry, just keep wearing those pads/tampons.  I have had the same problem, my longest period lasted 3 weeks.<br>  I ended up telling my mom about it (she is a doctor) and she said that it was completely normal because I had just started my period.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped :D|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I would go to the doctor.  It may be wise for you to get on birth control - I've been on it for 10 years now and my periods are roughly 2-3 days total.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	You shouldnt be on it this long. You need to go to your doctor
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	I've heard that you stop growing taller by 21. As for other puberty like growth, I don't think that really ever stops. Having children, birth control pills and other hormonal changes seriously affect your body. I though everything was as it was then I got pregnant. My body looks very different, clothes fit differently and even sex is different. My mom says the same thing happened to her with menopause.|`|dazBEG9waa	Yes that includes height, I never heard of second growth spurt but a girl's body changes a little in early twenties and becomes more like a woman's body. but everyone is different.
fnEv1p30aa	teenagers get this alot<br>  ur not depressed not yet<br>  <br>  just be along for a while<br>  watch TV and most of all forget about life <br>  i suggest watching the science chanel so ur mind will focus on learning the topic they say<br>  and dont watch soaps or shows that may hint anything at normal human life lol<br>  cuz rite now i think orit appears u want to escape normal life|`|jhNG0Y6Daa	depression is very common and although things look so bad right now they will get better. I know the hardest thing to do when you feel depressed is to go and socialise,but it does help just being around your friends for a few hours. Or exercise is very good and releases endorphins and allows you to get rid of fustrations. I don't like meddies either but sometimes they do help and you can come off them at a later date.|`|XEvK4urxaa	sent you an email|`|TQ47vny4aa	You have to get up off your butt and get moving around. I know you have a lot of things in your life that bring you down but you have to pick yourself up and be thankful you are alive. What helps me is knowing that there are a lot of people worse off than I am. Also just because you get on meds for depression does not mean you will stay on them. I was for over 16 years and have been off for over 2 now and everything is so much better for me. Please look at the bright side of life and get moving around, talk to your friends, go out to the mall anything but just sitting around all that does is makes things worse.|`|T64zP6fgaa	As a teen or really any age a persons hormones can fluctuate or get imbalanced , and that can and does cause depression....   so if you ever find a doc that does hormone balancing , try that and get your thyroid checked with a simple blood test also...<br>  Yeah it is sad about your smom....she should look into the lawsuits about whatever meds they had her on...<br>  Finally, I use the resource below, it is free, and it works, which seems to be what you are looking for, take care|`|5ia8xAuIaa	im so sorry you feel this way. i really am. but if you have any hobbies, do those! that always cheers me up. or whenever i feel down, i play my piano. but whatever you do, if you try something new when you have those feelings, dont try it. you might get aggravated with yourself and that might make you feel worse. i hope that helps. :) ill keep you in my prayers.  good luck.|`|JGj8TN2saa	well there are reasons why you're depressed try to think of those reasons and think what you can do to make them better. another reason try to get something that you want something that you know that will make you happy|`|G1eiUqF2aa	look for the good things not the bad! think about things that have gone right!|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Everyone goes through ups and downs, I've been like that before when I didn't want to see anyone or do anything but hang out at my house all by myself.

Likst1Mxaa	awww that sucks.<br>  <br>  remember that self harm is one way you have learnt to deal with other issues in your life. try and find another outlet to help you out. Like, if you like art, try and express your emotion thru that. Also, if you make it thru a rough period without self harming REWARD YOURSELF with something you love - free time, a fave treat etc.<br>  <br>  Friends and family can be REALLY hard to talk to, mostly because you are so close and sometimes they just don't get it. Don't take it to heart. Maybe talk to someone else you you are less close to who might help.|`|NJzye6kJaa	I don't like the sound of the 'professional' you were referred on to. A psych should know that self harm is a terrible and difficult thing to get past. I know for a fact that it feels like the only way to deal with your emotions. I would suggest finding another psych or someone you trust to help you through it. Wish you all the best|`|XEvK4urxaa	sent you an email :)|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Yes you do! You are making a choice and every time you do this you have thoughts that go with it. Change your thoughts and you change the behaviour.  Think, think, think. You only have to do this one day, on hour or one minute at a time. No more.  If you want a life, if you want a future and if you want children, then now is the time to stop abusing yourself. You deserve better and only you can give this to yourself. Take a good, hard look in the mirror and what do you see. Ask yourself when did this start and why? Start to write about what you are feeling before you do this, and I do believe you will find your answer. God Bless and good mental health

72iZuDjeaa	do what you want, but it's been 13 successful years so far and the numbers of vasectomy pregnancies are almost nonexistent|`|vnJG8UYJaa	It sounds like you have some huge anxiety about this situation.  Have you considered a tubal ligation for yourself?  This would handle the situation in two ways which should give you total security that you would not become pregnant.  I understand your anxiety, but you could put a lot of strain on your relationship with your husband if you don't find a way to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	I think you are smart.  It happened to my mother.  She had my youngest brother after my father had a vasectomy.  It was so sad.  Family members took sides and they were ugly to my mother.  She had a blood test to prove my little brother to everyone because she was tired of the gossip and she knew she had never been with another man other than my father.  She showed them!  I am so proud of her now!  She stuck to her  principals.  Take the test.|`|uM2IZBobaa	A vasectomy is a permanent sterilization of the man.  If he was sterile in 1998, he is still sterile.  But I also understand the need of the woman to know for sure.  If it will help assuage your fears, get the test too.  It will show he continues to be sterile.|`|qBvDaOzeaa	When a life is at stake, it's always worth it.

Why don't you just talk to your husband and ask him to do it? Explain your concerns to him and let him know that having this "piece of mind" would mean a lot to you!<br>  Whether this test is done in a doctor's office or at home with a home test kit as you describe above, your husband is under no legal obligation to submit to it. You best bet is to TALK to him and REQUEST that he does it.

Also try to start with a 15 min exercise each day nothing strenuous to get your body use to healthy activity to combat the effects of fatigue.  Think positive about the outcome as your mind has a lot to do with the affects of what is going on with your body.  I hope this helps a little.

bmWKETgWaa	One reason women get pedicures is that as we get older, it gets harder and harder to bend down and care for our own feet.<br>  <br>  Wearing nylons or synthetic-fiber socks can make your feet and toenails more prone to fungus diseases, principally athlete's foot on skin areas and toenail fungus beneath the nail bed.<br>  <br>  One symptom of athlete's foot is red cracks between the toes, but another is dry, flaky skin all over your feet but mainly on the sides and bottoms.  <br>  <br>  Lotrimin and Lamisil are both effective medications for fighting athlete's foot.  You also have to be diligent about washing and drying your feet, wearing clean cotton or wool hosiery, and treating the insides of your shoes with the spray form of the medication.<br>  <br>  Once you've cleared up the athlete's foot (if that's what you have) you can keep your feet softer and more crack-free with daily applications of any good hand and body lotion. <br>  <br>  Badly-fitting shoes can cause calluses and corns that are hard to get rid of.  My feet have grown slowly over the years, but I have gained pounds and pounds during that time as well.  I have quite a collection of shoes I can no longer fit into.  To keep on wearing too-tight shoes is false economy!|`|coMusueeaa	they begin to fall off.|`|c3o5QVcOaa	Apply pusssy juices to your feet daily.

ARTqP2w6aa	Cracked heels are a common foot problem that are often referred to as heel fissures. Cracked heels are commonly caused by dry skin (xerosis), and made more complicated if the skin around the rim of the heel is thick (callus). For most people this is a nuisance and a cosmetic problem but when the fissures or cracks are deep, they are painful to stand on and the skin can bleed - in severe cases this can become infected.<br>  <br>  Look at the link I've provided (source link) for more information :) Hope it helps your husband|`|RyYV3aXlaa	they are to dry.....|`|AA11203836	that can be pretty painful. he probably wears flip flops alot, it tends to make your feet dry when you dont wear socks and shoes. I suggest getting a good pumice stone or one of those ped-egg things on tv (they work awesomly!). to heal the heels you should get this cracked heel balm they sell in the footcare section in the drugstore. its important to really moisturize the area well. Use something thats almost vaseline like, a pair of socks...it will clear up pretty quickly.|`|tgIohzO6aa	maybe athletes feet??<br>  check out the link below for more info|`|LbDoNsQqaa	well sometimes it can be due to sweating discomfort or hes wearing the wrong type of shoe try getting a pair of dr martens unless hes already wearing them and thats causing the problem if not they are a miracle for feet

Just because there is discharge don't mean it'll happen tomorrow or even next week for that matter.Though all those things you have mention are quit normal.Those aren't really sign's of starting your period signs are<br>  -breast hurt<br>  -back hurt<br>  -behavior change (getting mean)<br>  -hungry a lot<br>  -cramps (not in every lady's case but most)<br>  -ache <br>  -dropping stuff a lot<br>  <br>  So once you have those signs maybe your period will start soon.

That came later on when I got older.... so I'd say you are definitely getting closer and it will come soon! Just keep watching out for it and if you are nervous that it might catch you off guard you can wear a pad or a panty liner so that you'll avoid any leaks. (cause you never know when it'll come!)|`|h1e6TvFpaa	mee too, except i am 13. i think it is a sign, and the discharge is healthy, and ytou will probable get oit sooner or later, ut if the discharge makes you uncomfortable, get a kotex pad and wear that, because they are small and unnoticeable, but will absorb that stuff.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|yBBjTVQaaa	Don't worry about a thing honey, you are completely normal.<br>  It sounds to me like you are due to start your period any time, but just relax and it will all  happen in it's own time.|`|MybJpwQlaa	There are some good answers here.<br>  But, let me say that, I have discharge EVERYDAY, no matter if my period is soon or just past.

It is most likely coming soon.|`|HwD1ICCLaa	the only thing is when you start to get discharge your period can come at anytime for me I had it for about a year then started my period whereas a friend of mine had hers for 4 years.<br>  <br>  I really wouldn't worry when your period comes because it isn't that great especially the pain lol, for my friend she started her period then developed all over but I developed before my period so you might start developing now and start your period later.<br>  <br>   just be prepared and carry round an (emergency kit) which has spare pants sanitary towel maybe tampons and some spray or perfume cause I always get a bit paranoid that I smell lol, but always make sure you keep yourself clean when you start and change when YOU need to. Andunfortunatelyy you will always have periods but I found out that my discharge got better after my period and with your boobs being tender it will be that your boobs have just started to grow and therefore the skin needs to stretch a bit hence why they are sore.<br>  :)   x x|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	It would  probably be soon.|`|QJHE3z1raa	you need the discharge for about 1-3 years<br>  get pantyliners<br>  and i think another year or two til it starts|`|m0kQMWYeaa	hey im 13 (just turned) and i got discharge at like 11 but still no period yet plus it will come everyday its a way of cleaning out your...downstairs area there is no telling  when it will come i guess apparently its when your discharge gets real heavy<br>  <br>  hope i helped and eveythings normal don't worry<br>  <br>  ha ha i have just answered your question and you have answered mine like 1 min 2 secs ago :O|`|C4ibOR7Laa	you can wear a panty liner for the discharge, and im not sure when your periods will start|`|dhJdAPn4aa	2-3 years.|`|bSiKrblGaa	Yes!

p7ZdohGTaa	Perhaps ADHD is the reason you are having trouble focusing, in general. You might also try going to a different church. Try linking up with a church youth group where you will be in touch with people of your own age who also do fun, group activities. This is a great way to learn about God and the bible. That way, in addition to your normal church services, you will be able to see things in a more casual and relaxed atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Try also eliminating sugary things from your diet.|`|6d6a92cfa24029ef82993ae689105908aa	It is just an excuse.

Rk46lIBwaa	The likeliest cause is still a urine infection, seek medical advice. In the meantime drink plenty of fluids, do not however go out of your way to drink cranberry juice as its effect on a current UTI is negligible.|`|zeZtFbGjaa	Its deffo an infection, get to ur gp asap for anti-biotics<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and make sure u drink lots of water|`|RHCUtrxnaa	It DOES sound like a UTI (urinary tracts infection). Having a UTI doesn't mean you'll always have a burning sensation. The symptom you have is a trademark of UTIs. Have you had sex (unprotected or not) recently? There can be many causes for UTIs besides sex. But sexual activity is the most common. cause. Also, have you taken any antibiotics recently? I know it doesn't sound right, but antibiotics can cause UTIs. The most common causes for UTIs are, E. coli, N. gonorrhea (yes, the STD), and S. aureus. Being on birth control can cause UTIs also.<br>  <br>  A UTI that has moved to your kidneys,  causes frequently "rush" feelings like you have to pee. The feeling you have to pee but you cannot, is also common. I'd be safe and get it checked out.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SqNoMz7vaa	Well I had that. I felt as I wanted to pee so badly and I had to go to the toilet a LOT and when I sat down I only peed a few droplets or nothing! I went to the doctor and it appeared to be a kidney disease.

Although burning can indicate a UTI, in medicine I've been taught to "never say always, and never say never".<br>  <br>  You can try cranberry juice and lots of fluids, but if it doesn't go away, check in with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|BTT1zgIqaa	Urine infection or chill in bladder.<br>  Best see your doctor.
8l8siZ3paa	To answer your question, you will see some improvement in 5-10 days, but the real change will occur in 10-15 years, as your skin matures and gets older, dark marks and blemishes from pimples on your face will heal, and fade away, almost completely. It is a long process. It takes many years before they completely blend with the color of your skin. Keep in mind, there is no perfection, and this is a relatively slow process!<br>  <br>  As to acne, I feel lucky because I've never had any acne. Because acne is the worst. The problem with acne that it can leave long lasting scars on your face! And scars are much worse than dark marks and blemishes!<br>  <br>  As to pimples, chances are, you're hoping a quick solution... a big, positive change in one to ten days. This can be an issue! The younger you are, the more hope you can have for quick healing and self-correction made by your own body. But the older you are, the less hope you can have. Sorry!<br>  <br>  As to treating your pimples, you need to treat them right, because, if you don't, you will regret your actions! Sometimes inaction is better than action. Because action can make things worse. For example, when I was a teenager, I remember, one day I was impatient, and simply squashed a pimple on my face, and, now, after many-many years, if I check the very same spot on my face, and if I look very closely, I can still see a darkish mark, a tiny blemish from that pimple on my face!<br>  <br>  In conclusion, what are the lessons here? The lessons are... <br>  A) You need to be very careful about treating your face and pimples! <br>  B) It's up to you, how you treat your pimples, or how you let them treated! <br>  C) Treat your pimples right, because, if you don't, you might regret it later! <br>  D) Often inaction (i.e. letting your body take care of it) is better than taking any action!<br>  E) Taking drastic action can make things worse!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
xERwr6Ukaa	Sorry about your sickness, but it sounds like the flu.<br>  Be sure to take a calming bath to help your soreness, and get in bed and rest. Drinking fluids such as Orange Juice or Gator Aid, and eat pop sickles. <br>  Take Advil or tylenol for the aches and pains, and try to visit a pharmacist for antibiotics.

B1, C, D, and E.  <br>  <br>  -Cocoa is also the highest natural source for Magnesium. Magnesium deficiency is linked with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and joint problems.<br>  <br>  -The fat in high quality plain chocolate can be considered cholesterol free as it does not fur up the arteries or contribute to high cholesterol levels.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

AA11088528	My doctor used to have me take 1 Tylenol Extra Strength and 1 Aleve together to ease my pain. The acetaminophen in the Tylenol will relieve the pain and the Naproxin in Aleve is for the inflammation.

Not much different that the secretion of beta cells and better than using those insulins originally derrived from pigs and cows (which could cause allergic reactions due to animal proteins).<br>  <br>  3 - whether or not it is safe to run a little high or take extra insulin is something you should discuss with your doctor.|`|AA10299265	Just for your information, type two doesn't come from eating too much sugar... and isn't our fault, either.<br>  <br>  1.

yBBjTVQaaa	I don't want to put you off but it is not similar to getting a swab taken. I haven't had kids and I found it very painful,the worst part for me were the cramps that I got after it was inserted. This lasted two days and then 2 weeks out of every month. Periods are heavier and more painful. I lasted 2 years with it thinking it would settle down eventually, it never did so I go it out last month. No pain on the way out. Having said all that everyone is different and it might be totally different for you. I had the copper coil which is meant to be much worst than the mirena .( mirena has hormones included ). Good Luck whatever you decide.<br>  P.S. If you do get it take a pain killer about half an hour before you go in, it will help the cramps.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It is really just like having a smear. Added to this discomfort, rather than pain is a 1 second sharp sensation as the IUD introducer enters the cervix through the os.  A few women also experience a brief period of uterine spasm.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	I've heard from ppl it feel similar to having cervical swabs|`|MfsV8mh3aa	Not very. I have had one before and after having children and there wasn't much difference in pain but oddly was more anxious after children.<br>  I had a copper coil before children and now have Mirena. There is a short pain which isn't that bad but because it comes from nowhere it a bit of a shock. My GP used to make women arrive early so she could give a specific pain relief / relaxant first but can't think of the name now.. You could take a couple of paracetamol before you go.<br>  <br>  You sometimes bleed a little afterwards so worth taking a nice sanitary towel rather than risking getting one of those giant things you sometimes get from docs.<br>  <br>  perfectly able to function normally afterwards.

It was extremely painful for me, and nothing like any normal procedure you have done at the gyn.  When they measured my cervix that was painful, but insertion was worse, particularly so because they couldn't get it in and it took 30 minutes and 3 people to get it in instead of the usual 5 minutes.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It shouldn't feel too painful, it's uncomfortable more than anything. The best time to have the IUS inserted is during your period. Insertion is easier at this time as the area is naturally dilated. <br>  <br>  Unless contradicted, take a few Ibuprofen beforehand.

It happens because blood flow (which carries oxygen) cannot get to your foot. Usually, it happens when you are sitting with your legs crossed or sitting funny.

And the long term results are worth it!|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Depends on your pain tolerance.  If you have waxed your legs or plucked your eyebrows and started balling then it would be a 15 for you.  But then again even with a high pain tolerance it still is about and 7 to a 9.  It's no picnic honey, but I would definitely choose it over shaving.

It is a great treatment for premenstrual disorders. I dont know if that is what you have, but you have been pretty much fully worked up and they arent finding anything.,  A 3 or 4 month trial of the pill wouldnt hurt.  Your symptoms are not classic for premenstrual but it does follow your cycle.  The pill would prevent the hormonal fluctuations that occur with the cycle, you can even take the pill in a way that you will have fewer periods and maybe, fewer episodes of what you have.

qRKOWgS0aa	Cause of the Common Cold<br>  Ever wonder what causes a common cold? The answer is overwhelming, as more than 200 different viruses are known to cause the miserable signs and symptoms of the common cold. <br>  <br>  The most common causes of the common cold are viruses -- rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The rhinovirus group causes 10% to 40% of colds. The coronaviruses and RSV are responsible for 20% and 10% of cases, respectively. <br>  <br>  Common Cold Causes: Rhinoviruses<br>  Rhinoviruses, the worst offenders, are most active in early fall, spring, and summer. More than 110 distinct rhinovirus types have been identified. These viruses grow best at temperatures of about 91 degrees, that perfect body temperature right inside the human nose. Most rhinoviruses seldom produce serious illnesses. Other cold viruses, such as parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus, produce mild infections in adults but can lead to severe lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, in young children. <br>  <br>  Common Cold Causes: Coronaviruses<br>  Scientists think coronaviruses cause a large percentage of adult colds. These cold viruses are most active in the winter and early spring. Of the more than 30 kinds of coronaviruses, three or four infect humans. The importance of coronaviruses as a cause of colds is hard to assess because, unlike rhinoviruses, they are difficult to grow in the laboratory.<br>  <br>  Other Causes of the Common Cold<br>  About 10 to 15 percent of adult colds are caused by viruses also responsible for other, more severe respiratory illnesses.<br>  <br>  The causes of 30 to 50 percent of adult colds, presumed to be viral, remain unidentified. The same viruses that produce colds in adults appear to cause colds in children. The relative importance of various viruses in children's colds, however, is unclear because it’s difficult to isolate the precise cause of symptoms in studies of children with colds.<br>  <br>  There is no evidence that you can get a cold from exposure to cold weather or from getting chilled or overheated.<br>  <br>  Stress, Allergies, and the Common Cold<br>  There is also no evidence that your chances of getting a cold are related to factors such as exercise, diet, or enlarged tonsils or adenoids. On the other hand, research suggests that psychological stress and allergic diseases affecting your nose or throat may have an impact on your chances of getting infected by cold viruses<br>  Hope that helps.

They won't care who you are or why you buy what you buy.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a website you can trust.<br>  <a href="http://shop.tootimid.com/male-sex-toys.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://shop.tootimid.com/male-sex-toys.a...</a>|`|72iZuDjeaa	try a fleshlight dude, they're fun... be sure and order the correct size... my fave is the super ribbed and my boyfriend likes the wonder wave ;-)<br>  i would post the link but i'm not doing that anymore just google fleshlight.com<br>  <br>  have fun ;-)<br>  <br>  and btw, nobody in the store cares if you buy condoms, in fact it's a good thing ;-)|`|Tl3lF37Xaa	check this web-site <a href="http://pleasuretoys.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://pleasuretoys.biz/</a>|`|pTx9Hsavaa	try water-melon,saw a guy screwing  one,by having a long hole done in it.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	East or West_ Hand is the best for masturbation.|`|HwgX5AH3aa	Think the most common one for the male market is the fleshlight.

There is help for that.<br>  I was suffering from panic attacks and didn't even know what they were.<br>  I was anxious for no reason - and couldn't stop the physical symptoms or the emotional "what if's???". <br>  Start first with your medical doctor and a physical, then counseling. <br>  If you need meds for a time - go for it. <br>  Would you be ashamed if you were suddenly diagnosed with diabetes or cancer?  Of course not - you'd find out how to get better and treat it.  <br>  <br>  You ARE a normal teen with much to be thankful for - but something needs your attention right now.  If you had a cold - you'd take care of yourself right?<br>  All the best to you!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Is it normal to feel weak and unusual in high school? Is it normal to have panic attacks ? Yes to both. You may feel like everyone is looking at you like your some kind of leper or something but that's what kids do best. This is a good opportunity to find out who is a true friend and who's just hanging on. The ones who care about you and worry for you are your friends. The rest can go about their own lives and you don't have to bother with them again.  Nor should you.<br>  God bless.|`|AA11601031	YOU SHOULD TRY MEDITATION.  It might help relieve stress and calm your nerves.  Good luck.|`|VF14bk8iaa	It's normal for you to be embarassed, but if you shy away from people now they will only think about the panic attack more. Be confident in yourself and know that this is something that happens to A LOT of people. Let people know that you know this happened but it's ok. You're still the same you. If you are confident you will force people to forget about it. I know it sounds hard, and it IS a difficult thing. But be conscious of it and people will notice.|`|5252b87f0baa1d9761f2e9a949fa20baaa	Panic attacks are only understood by those that experience them.<br>  I am much much older than you and have had panic attacks stemming from normaly trivial things that suddenly overwhelm you. You feel light headed, dizzy, out of sorts and like you are falling. This is not uncommon.<br>  You are too young to be having this happen and I am not a Doctor so I suggest you see yours and explain what happened.<br>  Taking anti anxiety medication can become addictive so other apporaches to dealing with these feelings, should they occur again, should be considered.|`|dN1d8cuNaa	Well, there is nothing to be embarrassed about, and the reason this started is because you work too hard. Maybe try to relax more in class, also lay off the sports if you over play. You loose too much energy, Which may start making you depressed. A tip is to take a relaxing day, at least once a week.|`|kr5meaVvaa	Yeah, its normal.<br>  Anyone would re-act to that.<br>  You should go check that out with your doctor.<br>  And maybe you just had the chicken pox.<br>  Or you were sweating alot, that happens sometimes, at times.<br>  :) Nothing to really worry about,<br>  don't feel ashamed.

I no longer get nervous on the freeway... that's just one example of how I am able to control this, mind over matter. anxiety is defiantly mental, but your physical health has a lot to do with it too... do you eat healthy? I read that a build up of too many toxins can often affect the nervous system.. be sure to stay on a healthy diet if you get these panic attacks a lot.. <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better!
Zq1mWeIiaa	I'm just going to deal with the Driving Test part. <br>  <br>  Most people fail the first time, it's a chaotic test (the van on the roundabout for example) unlike a written paper (unless the test supervisors are planning to jump behind you and pull your ears). I believe having a nightmare first driving test is a good thing, it gives you more respect for the road.  In my experience anyone who says they passed first time (always said with a smug grin) is either a liar or, ironically, a bad and arrogant driver.<br>  <br>  I passed the 3rd time. I was used to it by then and the nerves were gone. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck to you.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	I failed my driver's test too. You'll pass eventually.  At least you're trying to learn and obtain your driver's license legally, unlike so many others who just buy fake ones. Good for you!|`|w29tsXLUaa	You are taking the worries of the whole world on your shoulders. You have to try to calm down and get things into prospective.<br>  <br>  Once you realise that a lot of people do not pass first time. That should make you realise you are not rubbish. You tried, it did not work, so you grit you teeth, jut out your chin and try again.<br>  <br>  You do the same with the forthcoming examination.<br>  <br>  You do not have a stigma. That is what you think.Not what other people think.<br>  <br>  There are many difficulties for you to meet with the transport side of things and your job. Why not sometimes take a taxi. For a luxury.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard the saying 'the man who never made mistakes never made anything.' Making mistakes or failing the test in your case will mean that when you pass next time you will be a far better driver and safer.<br>  <br>  So I would suggest. Cheer up. Have a nice warm bath and an early night with a good book. Sleep well.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow is another day and you can greet it with a smile. You will feel much better than dwelling on your inadequacies<br>  <br>  Good luck. It always comes to those who wait. Your grandad knows you will not let him down (or yourself for that matter)|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Hi Ade, Many people fail their driving test the first time so dont worry.  I know of someone who failed 5 times before he passed!  Go for a walk, that might clear your head and relax you.  Spend time answering other people's questions on here to take your mind off things or read a book.  Make sure you've prepared for your exam, all you can do is your best.  Good luck.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	You are too focused on your failures.  We all mess up and some of us mess up all the time.  Even your sister and your father.<br>  That is just life. <br>  You regroup, dust yourself off and start again. <br>  So you will pass the test next time around, now you know what to expect. <br>  Ignore people that make you feel bad.<br>  Picture yourself passing the exams and you will!!
kC8JHWVQaa	1Seek immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, a gum boil can't be treated naturally. It requires immediate medical care to resolve the issue and get your pain under control. If you can't get a hold of your dentist, you can visit your local emergency room for care. <br>  Step2Request mouth x-rays. The only way to diagnosis a gum boil accurately is to get x-rays of the affected area. This will allow the doctor to make a proper diagnosis of the condition. <br>  Step3Be prepared to hear that tooth extraction may be needed. This will allow the gum boil to drain, which will aid in healing. Your medical provider will administer pain medication to ensure your comfort during this process. <br>  Step4Ask the dentist if a hole can be drilled to save the tooth. If the tooth has a normal appearance to the gum and bone support, the tooth may not need to be removed. A hole is drilled through the top of the tooth to allow draining of the affected area. <br>  Step5Know that you may need a root canal. This is typically preformed after the affected area begins to heal. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Promote healing of a gum boil. Once you have been to the doctor, you can do a few things to promote healing. Rinse your mouth with warm water often to clean out the infection. Also, it's important not to chew on the affected side of the mouth for several days.<br>   <br>  Gum boils can be serious. If you leave this medical issue untreated, it can abscess and the infection can spread to your bloodstream. This is why immediate medical attention is advisable.|`|AA10077992	Yes - quickly and easily but make sure you keep the dentist appointment - he may wish to give an x-ray
yeDv4E9uaa	When I get a a sore throat, I gurgle mouthwash (particularly mint) or salt water. If you do that, then it will go away for a few hours. If you do 2-4 times it will be gone because it is killing all the germs in your throat. For the runny nose, if you use nasal spray, it will open your passages and it won't get any worse. If I were you, I would do all this and take cold medicine, a motrin, and you should be good! I absolutely hate colds I know. I just had a cold, and my grandma told me to do all of this, and it worked. Trust the elders!|`|5GslKD4baa	Wear a scarf or a muffler and a hat.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself warm, and get some fresh air.<br>  <br>  Keeping away from school because of a cold or sore throat is just silly.|`|SFai2Eb9aa	i never miss any school b/c of a sore throat or a cold|`|ho0JgShXaa	dirnk some alka-seltezer cold relief medicine

YGENlhUwaa	There's lots of reasons our joints crack and creak. Sometimes it's just normal cracks called (i may have this wrong but it's close) crepis.<br>  It also could be a build up or depletion of senovial fluids or uric acid in the joint (most likely, we ALL have this issue to a point).<br>  You can take glucosamine and chondroitin (I don't recommend it)<br>  OR You can take 2 teaspoons a day of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar. (It HAS to have the mother in it...so NOT Heinz ACV). This helps to relieve the joints. This is my highest recommendation. Also...you'll need to start walking and stretching daily. It's good for your joints (and your entire body) because it promotes better blood circulation and movement of lymphatic and other bodily fluids.<br>  Fish/cod liver oils don't do anything to help "lube" your joints...that's not how fish/cod liver oil works.|`|kTDobubBaa	It is cause your ankles and knees where in a wrong position or like if youve sat on your knees too long.

Try to distract yourself by talking to someone else in the room or listening to your ipod but DO NOT look at the needle. It will be over before you know it and you'll realize it didn't hurt at all. Get the flu shot first since it rarely has any side effects. You won't even feel the needle go in and when it's over, you'll realize there was nothing to it. Then get the tetanus shot. Again, you won't feel the needle stick but later, your arm may be a bit sore where you got the shot. Then, get the HPV shot in your other arm. You won't feel the needle stick but some girls experience some soreness in the arm it was given. Some have no problem at all. Getting all three shots will only take a few minutes and afterwards you'll realize you didn't even feel them. Make sure you RELAX your arm. If you are tense, the shot will make your muscle hurt more. IT might also be a good idea to be sitting down when they give you the shots, especially the HPV. When it's all over, you'll wonder what you were scared of and remember it's important to get your vaccinations so you'll be protected. Good luck at your checkup Rohce! Maybe they'll give you some cute bandaids you can show off.|`|VwLYYt5Qaa	Reassure yourself that a serious fear of needles will not harm you.

1YdeUn1Caa	Autism is a genetic disorder. Not something caused by smoking.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	No one knows for sure what causes autism.  Some researches feel it's the vaccines, some don't.  Some researches believe that there are learning genes that weren't "turned on" and that's what causes it.  But I very seriously doubt that your mother's past smoking had anything to do with it.  Here are a couple of links to the many places that discuss autism.<br>  <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_whatcauses" rel="nofollow">http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/mental-health-autism" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/men...</a><br>  Also, it isn't that your brother doesn't like you.  Children with autism just don't like to be interrupted from their routines, but it's good that  you do.  Make that connection with him to bring him into the now and out of his own little world.|`|Nw6DbfCcaa	It is some kind of chemical imbalance in the brain, caused by genetics usually. No kid ever got it from their mother's smoking. In fact, nicotine is sometimes used to treat autism! Back when I was a kid, autism was unknown, but kids were normally exposed to secondhand smoke, and lots of kids (especially ones with issues) often got firsthand smoke, so kids who might have been autistic otherwise were able to function normally by smoking!|`|oW8BYkkhaa	The answer is unknown. As far as smoking being the cause, I just don't know, factually speaking smoking has been on the decline for the past 20 years while known cases within the autism spectrum have been on the rise.|`|9a2pClPPaa	Autism is from an unknown source. thats why the symbol for it is a puzzele peice. do u ask questions to the docters? maybe thats why they dont give u answers|`|CegkTi6Haa	My 8 year old nephew is autistic and really smart. He's bad at math and handwriting but very good at reading/english and fantastic at art. He used to not answer me when I talked to him but he has warmed up to me quite a bit and even rests his head on me occasionally and talks to me a lot. He talks incessantly hehe.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I've heard smoking can often cause birth defects/preemies and other health problems. I don't know about the shot though but it wouldn't surprise me if it did cause it as well.<br>  <br>  Oh, also I have a similar disorder called nonverbal learning disorder, also called hyperlexia, very similar to aspberger's and autism so I'm well aware of the difficulties. I was born almost a month early and they say that can cause learning/development problems. Was your brother born prematurely? My mom didn't smoke or drink but she had preacclampsia so she almost lost me/died herself.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps you somewhat, forgive my rambling. =)

wIobEkFbaa	Exercise in the water. Stretch slowly. Breath. Don't pay a lot of attention to the "medical model" because typically this advice is based on symptom analysis. Your goal should be to get your chi/Qi/Energy moving to work itself towards and around the spine. As far as the protectionist vibe - hey - everyone has to make a living! Your job is to heal and strengthen yourself.|`|7GThW3gTaa	Here's my advice. That indeed is a tricky area of the back. Kind of hard to reach. There are classic lifts that work that area and buff it up but at this point I don't suggest you lift any weights. Have you tried gentle stretching in a warm pool? Many people don't know it, but if an area needs to be worked on, it is possible to start with gentle stretching and then later, as you gain flexibility, gentle pulses IN the stretching CAN in fact start to build strength, especially if you were a bit weak in that area to begin with. See what I mean?|`|3CqCfbzEaa	My ortho doc at Mayo gave me this one, it is awesome and you will love it. There's a really great and safe exercise I found after I got a hairline fracture at T-12. Stand with your feet slightly apart, arms loose at your sides, now bend your elbows. Now reach one bent arm up and over your head and the other one behind your back. Do 3 gentle stretches like this only what feels comfortable. Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. You are an adult and can and should make your own decisions based on good information. Ignore those license protectionists.|`|kfB7VfNyaa	Pay no attention to those people obsessed with advice parameters. Sheesh. Lighten up, people.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	Do not let anyone on these boards tell you what to do.  As a PT without examining you, I would not give any advice nor should anyone with a medical license.<br>  <br>  Go speak with your physician or see a physical therapist to make sure you are not making things worse.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Sorry I agree with Mary here...it's not really meant to protect US, but it's meant to protect YOU. Furthermore, it is against the LAW for a PT (or anyone else for that matter) to advise anyone on theraputic exercises for a condition for which you are seeking medical care without first evaluating you. The other stipulation would be unless you have been given "clearance" to resume activity as normal.  <br>  <br>  If you have been given such clearance, we must divulege your goals further:<br>  There are many factors to consider regarding a T-12 "exercise." What is the purpose of the exercise: if its a postural issue things that increase postural awareness may be appropriate...yoga, ballet etc. In the end, we must remember that posture is a habit and not really a strength deficit. Functional activities such as these increase awareness of posture.  <br>  <br>  Is if for someone who has had a compression fracture due to osteoporosis? Once cleared to resume activity, weight bearning exericses are most appropriate...more so than non weight bearing exercises such as swimming.  This is because weightbearing exercises are needed to increase bone mass.  <br>  <br>  Is it due to flexibility? The need to extend the joint, then exercises that increase flexiliby are most appropirate...cobra position is often appropriate but this depends on your flexibility deficits.<br>  <br>  ...and so on...<br>  <br>  So please do not think of this as a slant as a "protect" our "own." As I said, it is ILLEGAL for us to do without examination.  Should someone here tell you: do exercise ____________, and should you suffer dire consequences from that exercise, one could have legal recourse...it's also part of yahoo answers policy that this is not a place to substitute for medical advise.  This is a place for information sharing and entertainment. As a former "prosectuor" of licensees (I can only assume you mean you are a lawyer),  you should be well aware of this.  <br>  <br>  Your personal physical therapist should be the one answering this question for you.

t2R3mEMoaa	An evaluation can take a day, a month or years. People (professionals) will watch your behaviour, listen to what you say, which is very intrusive at times, and overseer how you communicate and socialize with others. When depression is the topic for a child, it means not only will the child be interviewed and watched, but so will his/her family surroundings come under scrutiny because a proper diagnosis must be made before treatment is given. It can be a rather unnerving situation to go through, having very personal questions asked. If a child is very young without conversation, then they are placed in a room either alone or with someone,(with alot of toys) and just watched. Behaviour can speak a thousand words to someone who is trained to understand it. Hope this helps and good mental health|`|bdcecff4c5d24df3f626e75937f26e3baa	It means that a psychotherapist, psychologist or psychiatrist will assess your mental state based on your answers to a psychological questionnaire that has a scale for depression to help screen among other possible diagnosis (e.g. bipolar, etc.). The evaluation will also include observations made on your body language during the interview process.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Monik.|`|nCMUA50Raa	it means that they will ask you a bunch of questions. to find out what is bothering you and to see if you are really depressed or if the problem is something other than depression.|`|7XCXVoNhaa	You Can find useful information about this problem in my source site

47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	Tactile hallucination describes it very well. I had a similar experience once in my life when I was delirious with a very high fever. I'm now 57 years old. I felt chunks of ragged iron scrap metal in my bed that my brother had to show me were not there. That's the only time I remember any such experience so if you've experienced it several times, I think you should mention it to a doctor when you see one next. I doubt that it's something that people experience very often but it's not at all unheard of.<br>  <br>  I have depression and my own set of little ordeals with nervousness and anxiety and have found that sometimes the best thing that I can do is to simply tell myself I've had this before, it went away, now, for whatever reason, I've got it again and this too shall pass.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Some people are more sensitive to the subtle energy that operates our bodies, and when sleeping the "conscousness"  [the subtle energy] pulls out of the body, and when one wakes up it rushes back into the body... and some people are more aware of this than are others.<br>  <br>  I would be most reluctant and skeptical to imagine that I had a "history of psychosis".... regardless who might have suggested this nonsense.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|AA11855970	Tactile hallucinations are usually associated with an organic process (ie something physical like injury, substances/drugs or the illness like uncle Crabby above had).  Traditional psychosis usually has auditory hallucinations.<br>  <br>  The other thing is that during the period between sleep and full waking (and vice versa) you can have all sorts of illusory type experiences of both a physical and psychological cause - for example heaing your name called as you fall asleep is a very common and normal experience.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that the tactil feelings you have could even be the hairs on your arms moving as you wake or relax.

ZfvoW3m7aa	Sorry, but Camille you're wrong... Epilepsy isn't "when someone goes nuts!"  I have epilepsy myself.  I've had seizures all my life and it's a disorder of the central nervous system.  Seizures are something that you have no control over.  It could have just been a seizure (sounds like tonic clonic).  If your father has never had seizures before, then he doesn't have epilepsy.... He just had a seizure.  Epilepsy is diagnosed when someone has had more than one recurring seizures.  He should definitely get this checked out though.  Make an appointment with a neurologist.  And check out this website... www.epilepsy.com... it will explain a lot of your questions.|`|e7NA8S9Laa	Im an ambulance assistant. And yes it is an epilepsy.

CRvdmFwCaa	That is a great question!<br>  <br>  I think it is embarrassing... the fact that we are bleeding! from our vaginas and have to wear a pad... which is pretty much like a diaper.  I used to be super embarrased about it.  When the hubs and I were first married I'd like turn the fan on in the bathroom... so he couldn't hear me open my pad up.  And I'd like wrap my Tampons in 1/2 a roll of toilet paper.... He'd smack my butt as I walked by him and I'd be like DON'T!!!! I have a pad on and you might touch it!!!<br>  <br>  He quickly assured me that there was no reason to be embarrassed about it... IT'S NATURAL he said!  He always teases me... "Anything that can bleed for a week and not die... beware of that!".  So... I guess in a mature relationship... all parties realize it is natural and normal... and ACTUALLY... some of the best sex I've ever had was while I was on my period (we do it in the shower).  This was as my husbands request.... I was SOOOO embarrased at first... but then I'm like OH!

Get yourself a pedometer and find a way to get in 10-15K steps a day.  The walking is excellent, low-impact activity, and quite honestly, it's a good time to just think.

jjjMP4m5aa	Person one: You should not give a rat's butt about what that person thinks, becaue they cant teae you becaue you're fat. You may not even be fat. I think they're just jelous that you take things easy, and are trying to drive you crazy. Talk to him/her, they may just have been mad, or having a rough day.<br>  Person two: Remember that this person may be holding a grudge aginst you, because it doesn't seem like they really know you. <br>  Look, I once had a friend that hated me, so she started telling me I was ugly. One day we fought, and I asked her why she had said those thing, and it turned out she was jelous of me because a boy liked me. People are stupid, they judge becue there's something you have that they dont. Besides, they talk s**t, they seem mentally challenged or something, ignore them.
bgJzeHIdaa	Your period is just irregular. That is all. There is nothing to worry about! My period does that all the time. For up to the first two years after your first period, it will be irregular. There is nothing to worry about. Stress is the only thing I can think of that would be delaying your period but again, nothing to worry about!|`|4M6RSigmaa	If you have been ill even a cold can effect your period.

The Pill can cause PMS symptoms, such as the ones you are describing. Generally speaking, people tend to experience side effects for the first couple of months and then find that it goes away. You only started the pill a few weeks ago, give it another month or so, if still no improvement, then see your GP again. <br>  <br>  We all react differently to medication, there is no 'one suits all' Pill. If this particular pill is not suitable for you then your GP will try you with another one. Your symptoms are highly unlikely to be the result of any serious problem.<br>  <br>  Lol, your spelling is bad sweetie, but it would be a tad hypocritical of me to critise you for it, considering I make plenty of spelling mistakes on here- as my nemesis's love to point out...|`|K119R72Caa	it's probably just the bills. Most pills have side-effects. Tell you parents about it because maybe the pills aren't suppose to be making you feel that way. Or just call your doctor and ask her/him about it.

c5XMnaNHaa	the aching and soreness you feel is microscopic tears in the muscle fibers and every time it tears the muscle rebuilds it and makes it bit bigger to handle the additional forces exerted on them. that's how you grow muscle is by destroying the fibers and next time it rebuilds it bigger. you also need rest so the muscle can have time to repair itself. after a good workout you should be able to feel the "burn" for at least a day after to insure that you have push your muscles to its limit to insure there's gonna be some repairing happening. it can also be dangerous when you push urself too far resulting it spraining or hurting urself. jst need to find ur limits and becareful. consult a doctor b4 any hard workout routine so he/she can monitor ur health along the way.|`|BUXwv2INaa	Your not doing it hard enough so your muscles cant actually do anything because your not gaining any muscle mass. If it is to easy ur muscles dont hurt u but if u do it harder they will hurt and they will reheal and as the result of thay reheal they will come out as stronger muscles.
1C123Xdsaa	You probably have athlete's foot, which can make your feet smell. You can also tell if you have it because your feet will be red or unusually white. Buy athlete's foot cream and powder from the store. It must be for athlete's foot, as both the cream and powder have an anti-fungal ingredient. Rub feet with cream, including between your toes,and for good measure some powder. Also, put powder into your shoes. The athlete's foot fungus likes dark, damp and warm conditions, so will be in your shoes too. After you have had a bath/shower, be sure to dry your feet thoroughly, including between your toes. Also, change shoes everyday, don't wear same shoes 2 days in a row. 3 days is probably better to let them air out. Buy more shoes and rotate your wearing of them.|`|pX4z9Qg0aa	change your socks more often like 2 to 3 times a day. keep using powder and maybe try some other shoes that let your feet breathe. if that fails you might check with your local pharmacist and have them recommend something for athletes feet.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Ehh, try deodorant? and try some perfume for the shoes....Im not sure...<br>  Change the shoes to something that can absorb the sweat.|`|tgIohzO6aa	While body odor is usually associated with the armpits, bacteria can also produce odor in the groin, anus area, upper thighs, and feet, among other places. Thoroughly washing your skin with a wet washcloth and soap -- especially those areas prone to sweating -- can help prevent body odor.<br>  <br>  Remember that smelly feet can also cause smelly shoes. Treating your shoes with an over-the-counter deodorizer can help. Also, wear thick, absorbent socks if you can.<br>  <br>  Try a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water to fight body odor. Use one teaspoon of peroxide (3%) to one cup (8 ounces) of water. Wipe this on affected areas (underarm, feet, groin) with a washcloth. This may help destroy some of the bacteria that creates odor.<br>  <br>  wearing the same footwear everyday will not help..you need to have a shoe for sports and a shoe for street wear.<br>  <br>  If sweat from working out is your No. 1 cause of body odor, wash your workout clothes often. Sweaty gym clothes are a bacteria-breeding ground. <br>  <br>  for more info check out this link...|`|sPR3qpTMaa	You can try to get a Pair of Geox, that helped with my problem, another is that you get a good pair of Adidas, like AdiZero as they have very good ventilation, basically get airy shoes.|`|ARTqP2w6aa	Exactly the same thing used to happen to me till I started using cotton socks.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, Ok please can you tell me what you are doing at the moment and what you typical eating plan is currently.<br>  I can definitely set you up with a full programme, to include a exercise plan to do at home or outside a healthy eating plan and to fit that into your lifestyle, or change your lifestyle a bit to fit in the exercise plan.<br>  So why not get back to me with a bit more info and we can work together to get your results in the fastest possible time with health and safety very much in mind, how's that?<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|bajMF7LLaa	South Beach diet.<br>  <br>  cut your carbs and sugar.<br>  <br>  Pounds Melt off.   but u may feel like you're dying at first!!<br>  <br>  Hope u like meat and veggies.     1st time I did this I lost 10 pounds in 4 days.   just keep exercising and you will lose more.    your stomach will shrink and cravings will go away.   but once you fall off the wagon pounds are back on|`|MJt1xeQ7aa	just go on the cabbage diet for a week, id say 10 days is better as ul see more results. its not a faddy diet u eat lots of veg, fruit, and soup and u can lose up to a stone (14 pounds) in 7 days. otherwise eat less and do more, eat around 1300 a day and no fatnings or sugary things and have a bowl of cereal at night instead of a meal.|`|l82yIgeFaa	Hey there, Delilah =) haha<br>  <br>  Don't skip breakfast.

TC21ao0Paa	Initially, Nicotine is a stimulant ( the addictive part) as its' effects enter the body. Within 2-3 hours ( to the best of my knowledge), it becomes a depressant. <br>  The same rule applies to alcohol .|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Nicotine is primarily a stimulant, like any other drug it is addictive.

You don't need that much sodium in your system. Also I would warm up the salt water and add a bit of hydrogen peroxide... about 50/50 mixture.

AA10904201	You have given up hope on finding a romantic partner. This is not good. It means that you have really let yourself go and are in a bad cycle.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are not happy in your own body, so I would suggest that you start making some physical changes that will make you feel better on the inside. Try to eat healthily and get daily exercise. If you are too self conscious to do this in a public place, then even do it in your room. You can Google ways of exercising indoors. Dance to loud music while your alone.<br>  Set time aside to pamper your body. Like when you get our of the bath put body butter/ moisturizer on. <br>  Wear makeup if you don't already do so. (essential) Make up can make anyone look good, trust me!!!! Straighten your hair, and wear the right clothes for your shape.<br>  After you feel a bit better about your appearance, it will automatically make you more social. You will want to be noticed.<br>  I know people say that its not all about looks, but for some people, like you and me, the reality is that it is. If people are not happy with their appearance it can lead to social isolation, and start really ruining their lives.<br>  I am also like you.<br>  I wish you the best of luck. <br>  About the weight. Eat something that fills you (not over fills you) every four hours. Dont eat in between the four hours. The routine works. Until you start loosing weight, wear dark clothing that suits your shape.<br>  <br>  Good luck. xx Hope you have success and make new friends.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	Self esteem comes from within.

When you decide to have sex with a partner, that will eventually replace masturbation as your primary sexual outlet.  Masturbation has lots of health benefits, and is a known stress reliever.

You get sexually aroused and erect and stimulate your penis to ejaculation and climax- whether you do it by hand or use a willing vagina.  Only diferences are with masturbation you are not penetrating a vagina, and are usually alone. And not quite as much fun. Otherwise, yeah, solo sex versus sexual intercourse (consensual sex) are pretty much the same. Not really sure how people get the idea they are so different, or that masturbation somehow has mystical or magical effects on the human body.  Just plain bizarre to me.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Masturbation is just to relieve sexual tensions.  Real sex is real, flesh to flesh, with warmth and feeling.

I am sure it is just your wording that is wrong but you haven't actually gone through puberty but just started the process which will last to around age 18 <br>  You should not worry about taking 20 mins or so to orgasm and ejaculate during masturbation if you get into a habit of rushing to reach orgasm it can lead to premature ejaculation when you are old enough to have a partner . As for wet dreams this is certainly common early in puberty and although you are thinking that you ejaculated as soon as the dream started , in fact your body would have been building up over a period of an hour or more before the real part of the dream kicked in . These can be messy lol and it seems like there is a lot more fluid then when you masturbate , but that is just because you are usually more careful where you aim during masturbation . So you are fine the only thing I would caution you on is watching porn at such a young age . It can have an effect on your understanding of sexual matters and all the guys on there are chosen specifically for their bigger attributes etc . Make more use of your imagination when you masturbate and fantasise about someone you fancy , that is certainly what I did|`|XXbZAriNaa	you were extra horny|`|jQz5vABzaa	That's the power of your mind (that controls all your senses) so subliminal sensory feeling trigger your body.. etc..<br>  <br>  Get a hobby mate before u turn out a real pervert,<br>  <br>  GL,<br>  Cookie|`|EwmHsEoiaa	You shouldn't really be looking at porn at your age.

That's not what's important here. What's important is you loving yourself, knowing your smart, and knowing your pretty, because you know so. Not because someone else tells you. You have to love yourself because no one else is going to do it for you. You have to be confident, because no one else will be confident for you. And if people don't like it, then the hell with them. I'm not telling you to be stuck up, but you have to know what your capable of and expect greatness or you won't get it. One more thing. It shows when people don't feel good about themselves and sometimes this will attract the wrong type of guy. If you're not confident and a guy sees this, he may try to take advantage of you or think he can control you. He may also think since you don't treat yourself that good, that he won't have to treat you good either. I didn't mean to write a book on here lol, but I hope I helped a bit.

K8mKH21zaa	Imagine a healthy tissue containing thousands of cells.  Each cell serves the greater good, which is the continuation of a person’s life.  Each cell is programmed so that when the cell is old or no longer needed, it dies a peaceful and timely death.  This death is call apoptosis.  All cells are in communication, which allows for the smooth repair and replacement of tissues and other aspects of cell behavior.  Communication takes place either indirectly, via exchange of messenger compounds such as hormones and growth factors, or directly via cell-to-cell contact.  Contact allows cells to respond to the “feel” of neighboring cells, via cell adhesion molecules, and to exchange messenger molecules through cell-to-cell portals called gap junctions.  With the help of proper communication, appropriate cells proliferate when new cells are needed, and when enough new cells have been produced, cell division stops.”  <br>  <br>  Cancer cells don’t act like the healthy cells described above.  Let’s discuss the pathogenesis of cancer. <br>  <br>  Initiation:  The transformation of a normal cell into a neoplastic cell occurs in response to one or more initiating factors.  The primary initiating factors appear to be chemical carcinogens, viruses, and ionizing radiation.  No matter what the source of insult, the result is damaged DNA, leading to mistakes when the cell divides with the eventual outcome of transformation into a cancer cell (neoplasm).  Actually mistakes in DNA replication happen all the time and our cells are equipped to handle this by either repairing the DNA, or by the cell committing a programmed cell death (apoptosis).  Therefore, in order for the cell to become cancerous, it must escape these protective mechanisms.  <br>  <br>  Proliferation:  In order for the individual cancer cell to propagate itself by division, it must also overcome numerous obstacles.  Actually, cancer cells do die, and the only way for the individual cells to become a tumor is for the rate of cell growth to overcome the rate of cell death.  It is believed that the cancer cells achieve their growth through the initiation of stem cells.  Stem cells are abundant in actively growing tissues, such as in tissue repair, but they are controlled.  In neoplasms, the stem cells proliferate unchecked.  Also, in cancers, the daughter cells are not fully differentiated, that is they do not exactly match the cell of origin.  For example a malignant liver cell is not exactly like a liver cell; it is a mutant.  Complementary approaches to cancer treatment employ natural agents that stimulate redifferentiation of the DNA.  <br>  <br>  Angiogenesis:  Tumors could only reach a certain size before they would exhaust themselves of nutrients if it were not for angiogenesis.  Simply put, this is the tumor’s ability to coax the body to supply it with a vigorous blood supply.  The mechanism by which this happens is complex, and will be the subject of an entire article in the near future.  A number of natural products interfere with angiogenesis and prescription drugs are in development that target angiogenesis. <br>  <br>  Invasion:  Invasion is one of the hallmark characteristics of a cancerous tumor. Normally different types of tissues have very well defined borders which is why you won’t normally find skin cells growing in deep muscle, or liver cells growing in the stomach.  The amazing human body uses a myriad of mechanisms to maintain order and boundaries, yet somehow cancerous tumors have the ability to invade and pierce these protective barriers.  The biochemistry by which this happens is complex and in many respects not well understood.  <br>  <br>  Metastases:  Metastases is another “hallmark” of cancerous tumors, and involves the ability of the primary tumor to “seed” via the blood stream or lymph system to distant sites where new colonies are established.  Metastasis is actually not very efficient.  In fact in a study of patients with renal cell carcinoma, it was found that their tumors released from ten million to one billion cancer cells into the bloodstream every day, but only 20% developed distant tumors.  (Boik, “Cancer and Natural Medicine, 1996) . <br>  <br>  Understanding of the mechanisms via which cancer cells grow and metastasize is leading towards promising complementary approaches.  Every stage of development mentioned in this article can be addressed via natural products and many by prescription drugs.  <br>  <br>  The Genetics of Cancer <br>  <br>  Cancer is fundamentally genetic, in that it arises from mutations distorting the information contained in genes.  For the most part, the genetic dysfunction is not inherited, but acquired during life.  In fact, probably less than 10% of cancer patients have a strongly predisposing inheritance and another 20 to 30% have a moderately predisposing inheritance (Ross,  “Introduction to Oncogenes and Molecular Cancer Medicine,”1998).  <br>  <br>  All of this genetics talk can become quite confusing, so we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible.  There is no doubt that s|`|0TT5q0cUaa	are you asking about brain tumors or any other ones?? <br>  A brain tumour, like a tumour anywhere else in the body, is a result of an abnormal proliferation of cells in the brain. A primary brain tumour is one where the tumour originates from the brain cells. Secondary brain tumours are cancers originating elsewhere in the body and spreading to the brain through the blood stream. It may be mentioned that some chronic infections like tuberculosis and fungal infections often produce a tumour like moss in the brain which may mimic a cancerous lesion. A brain tumour may directly destroy brain cells or it may cause brain dysfunction by various other means.<br>  <br>  The skull is a hard bony structure and thus provides only limited space to the structures within. Since the brain does not have any space to expand, a space-occupying tumour may be especially dangerous. Brain tumours can cause indirect damage by compressing brain tissue, inflammation of the brain (cerebral oedema) and increasing the pressure within the brain (intracranial pressure) by interfering with the circulation of brain fluid (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF).<br>  <br>  Though most tumours are classified as 'malignant' or 'benign', brain tumours are usually classified as "high grade" or rapidly growing and "low grade" or slow growing. This is because even non-cancerous brain tumours may be life threatening since they do not have space to grow and thus endanger other parts of the brain.<br>  <br>  Brain tumours are basically of two kinds – those that originate from the layers covering the brain (meninges) and those that originate from the brain cells. The former are called meningiomas. They are almost always non-cancerous and are easy to remove surgically. The tumours arising from the supportive tissues of the brain are called gliomas. They are more common in adults and are more dangerous, since they are usually malignant and can often not be completely removed.<br>  <br>  The most commonly occurring tumours in adults are gliomas, while in children, tumours usually arise near the brain stem (medulloblastoma).<br>  <br>  Some of the common symptoms indicating a tumour in the brain are:<br>  <br>  Frequent headaches that vary in intensity and time of the day. These headaches are usually intense in the mornings and ease out during the day.<br>  <br>  Nausea or vomiting<br>  <br>  Epileptic seizures or convulsions<br>  <br>  Visual disturbances due to compression of the optic nerve or oedema of the optic disc (papilloedema)<br>  <br>  Changes in memory functions<br>  <br>  Changes in speech<br>  <br>  Drowsiness and bouts of incoherence<br>  <br>  Partial or local paralysis. Neurological deficits like weakness or paralysis of some parts of the body, loss of sensation, unsteadiness of gait (ataxia), etc.|`|YMoOsKGCaa	when the cells go through osmosis they multiply(obviously), and if something goes wrong in that process the cell is "mutated". then once one cell is not normal when the mutated cell goes through osmosis, it multiplys. and after it start multiplying it will get larger and drop cancer cells into your blood stream. you cannot really prevent it unless you eat antioxidants like pomegranites(wrong spelling) and strawberrys.Stay healthy and be careful on how you take care of your self.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Any part in  Excess Growth of tissue cell may be a cause to get tumours, If it is on bone it is called as bone cancer On tissue level Cancer  tumour and if it is in the region brain it is called brain tumor.|`|cWuumdy7aa	there are four major phases of tumor formation. Each phase can take years to complete. The first one alone usually takes anywhere from 15 to 30 years.<br>  <br>  The first phase occurs when normal cells mutate into tumor cells and begin dividing out-of-control. This may take place over successive generations of cells. When just the right mutations occur, the cells will divide and grow to a small tumor.<br>  <br>  The second phase is called Carcinoma in situ. This phase is classified by the presence of a cancerous tumor that has not yet invaded other tissues. This phase usually lasts between 5-10 years and is limited by the nutrient flow to the tumor. If blood vessels can be induced to grow into the tumor (angiogenesis), the tumor will progress to the next phase, called the invasive stage.<br>  <br>  The invasive phase can happen rapidly, requiring only a few months. However, in some cases it may take up to five years. This phase is dependent on the ability of the tumor to invoke nearby blood vessels to grow toward it and provide it with nutrients - commonly referred to as angiogenesis.<br>  <br>  Metastasis, or dissemination to other tissues if the final phase. This phase has the same time period as the invasive phase, ranging from a few months to five years.<br>  <br>  At each phase, the cancer can either progress further or altogether diminish. If you add each phase up, the average for the cell mutating events and cancer diagnosis is 20-50 years apart. This is why cancer mostly affects older people. Actually, half of all cancers are diagnosed after the age of 65.<br>  <br>  A Few Checks and Balances... - Mutations must occur, but the cell must still live and divide. - DNA repair mechanisms must not be activated. - Our own immune system must not find the tumor and destroy it. - The tumor must get enough nutrients to continue to grow.|`|HfBLQ4sQaa	Everyone has cancer cells, in some people they just trigger.<br>  And in some they don't. no one knows why yet.<br>  a tumor is a group of cancerous cells which keeps collecting them over time until it is big enough for you to notice the bump.

You need to reteach your ankle how to move correctly. I would suggest taking it easy for a while. Exercise and stretch that ankle gently and gradually instead of going all out and jumping around on it. If there is a medical massage therapist or physical therapist in your area, you should look them up and see if they can help you.
YGENlhUwaa	The lines you see in your abs are tendons attaching the muscles to eachother in the rectus abdominis. Our abdomen is made up of internal/external obliques, transverse abdominis, and the rectus group. These muscles hold you...ERECT! And so you should be working this muscle group out anytime you're up and rotating, flexing, and extending your trunk. The reasons you may not be able to see those definitions is due to: too many layers of fat, genetics, underdevelopment of the muscles.<br>  <br>  You don't want to do your basic crunches and sit ups. They're awful body mechanics and I'd highly recommend at least a yoga ball (and the reason I stated above shows why these traditional work outs don't make sense). I use hip-hop abs and other standing up abdominal workout routines. You don't have to lay down to do abdominal work and in fact, I highly recommend NOT doing that. It's hard on the lumbar vertebra and you can only work certain groups of muscles at the same time. <br>  <br>  You'll have to drink more water, eat healthy, and workout daily (aerobic and anerobic) to see any results and because genetics may be a possibility you may never have the abs you're craving (like on the cover of a magazine).|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	By doing different forms of crunches and leg throws will help you get the defined abs, but I don't really know when you will see results.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Sit ups, crunchies, aerobics|`|d1tyTq6Saa	go to the gym and do everything there is there.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

GHD8JicSaa	PID can infect the uterus and fallopian tubes.   If severe the damage can block off the fallopian tubes permanently.   Your ovaries still work but the eggs will not be able to get down to the uterus and be fertilized.   You could still get PG with some of the artificial methods such as egg harvest and insemination outside the uterus then implantation of the eggs in the uterus.   If the tubes are not permanently blocked but damaged, you are at increased risk of ectopic pregnancy where the egg gets partly down and then fertilized in the fallopian tube then grows in the tube.  That is a non-viable pregnancy and if not caught early,  could cause rupture and severe bleeding and even death.   <br>  <br>  You will have to wait until the infection clears up.  If you get pregnant normally then you know there probably is not a problem.  If not,  then you may need a uteroscopy with retrograde dye studies to see if the fallopian tubes are open.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	I have had this several times and have gotten pregnant 4 different times.

Keep on saying "So That"<br>  <br>  Ask yourself "Why do I want to lose weight" and after you come up with a reason why... Just keep on saying SO THAT. <br>  <br>  For example - Why Do you want to lose weight... <br>  <br>  I want to lose weight to look better SO THAT... <br>  I can feel more confident about myself SO THAT... <br>  I can be the best looking person at my high school reunion SO THAT... <br>  I can see the surprised looks on the faces of my classmates SO THAT... <br>  I may be able to go on a date with the person I had a crush on in high school <br>  <br>  The more times you say SO THAT the more and more motivated you'll become to lose weight. <br>  <br>  <br>  Set deadlines and then reward yourself <br>  For example... If your big weight loss goal is to lose 100 pounds in 10 months... Then you can set 10 deadlines where you have to lose 10 pounds every month for the next 10 months so...<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  Set deadlines and then punish yourself <br>  If you don't meet your deadlines you have to punish yourself - so for example... <br>  <br>  Let's say you miss your deadline to lose 10 pounds a month by losing only 9 pounds... You have to punish yourself by not watching TV for a week or by not going shopping for a month and...<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Change Your Attitude <br>  Don't say "I want to lose 25 pounds"... Say "I have to lose 25 pounds or I'll lose my job" or Say "I have to lose 25 pounds so my spouse won't leave me"<br>  <br>  5. Post a Picture Everywhere <br>  Post of picture of what you want to look like when you lose weight everywhere you can.<br>  <br>  If you were skinny in high school... Post your old high pictures everywhere and if you always had a weight problem then...<br>  <br>  Cut out a picture of a person from a magazine, book, or even comic book that you want to look like and post that picture everywhere.<br>  <br>  Posting pictures like this everywhere helps you "keep your eye on the prize<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Hang out with skinny people<br>  <br>  There's a saying that goes like this... "If you hang out with 9 broke people -- You'll probably end up being the 10th broke person but...<br>  If you hang out with 9 rich people -- you'll probably end up being the 10th rich person and the same goes true for losing weight.<br>  <br>  Hang out with just skinny people and you'll pick up on their habits for staying slim.  You don't have to dump all of your overweight friends - you just shouldn't let their bad habits influence you.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Get a magazine and... <br>  Look at the sexy body of the person on the cover. <br>  Get a picture of yourself and cut out just the face. (make sure you're smiling in the picture) <br>  Take your smiling face & place it over the face of the person on the cover. <br>  Then I want you to do something crazy. <br>  Show the magazine cover to everyone you know & tell them this is how you're going to look real soon. <br>  If you're real crazy... Tell the person you have a crush on... This is what they'll miss out on in the future if they don't start going out with you now. <br>  And if anyone gives you that Yeah Right Look when you tell them... Use that as extra motivation to prove them wrong. <br>  Make copies of the magazine cover and post it everywhere in your house and make a special note under it saying "I will get a sexy body just like this cover model and when I do... I will laugh in the surprised faces of all the people who said I could never look like This"<br>  ...<br>  <br>  8.

W7ZOWxPJaa	Actually, if you will get up and practice and practice with your crutches you will be surprised how much mobility you have! Just don't put any pressure on your broken leg! Many people use crutches the wrong way and it is a lot of work. If you let your body swing in the crutches and let gravity do the work, with your entire body swinging back and forth, the crutches are not very bad at all and you can really go places. If you cannot get the hang of it, go to the hospital or a physical therapy place and have them show you the correct way to use the crutches. There is such a huge difference between the correct way and the wrong way and it will make a BIG difference in your quality of life for the next 6 to 8 weeks! Using your body's momemtum takes so much of the effort out of crutches!

Keep the area clean, try not to shave or irritate the skin, and if it turns into a larger spot, don't burst it. Just allow it to heal on its own, and keep the area as well-washed and clean as possible. If you burst it, you're likely to leave pock-marks/subdermal blood pockets which can fade in time, but can look unsightly. If the pimple doesn't raise to a head, visit your clinic, as you may have a wart instead, which must be treated by a medical professional.<br>  <br>  Disclaimer: As always, a medical professional should always be your first line or reliable advice, and not just Yahoo.|`|6j9Lb83Caa	yes you can, it may be nothing searious, but at the same time it may, just be careful of what it looks like if it feels and looks like its a pimple with puss inside then its a pimple, sometimes people like i very much get them because of the way out jeans fit on our bodys maybe a little tug around the waiste or sometimes the belts we wear can irritate our bodys.|`|luSKstMLaa	Yeah sure you can<br>  Probably just a sweat pimple from to much sport<br>  or you've shaven recently.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to wash it, with water only.<br>  dont use a cleanser down there.<br>  That skin is sensitive remember, and it could cause itching.<br>  Also try not to pop it.<br>  Let it go on its own time.<br>  Unless you plan to get naked soon<br>  <br>  lol<br>  tc|`|eNhVVmG7aa	I love easy questions.<br>  <br>  Yes, it can be "just a pimple" or "just an ingrown hair".

d3a097e50d7be83cf224920987d04143aa	he is a real jerk,... not all womens bleed ,..totally depend on your hymen,..cyclein,sports,swinmin,and lots of other activities can break hymen,...even masturbation too,..hey this also happen with boys ask ur boy he will too bleed there is a slight skin of the penis which is joined with the head of the penis,...but most boys break it while masturbation on high orgasm,...chill.!|`|y1gsXEwOaa	I actually does happen sometimes.<br>  The first time you have sex, it probably will.<br>  It depends on how stretched out your hymen is.<br>  Good luck! :)|`|dlO7DAbIaa	no.... i have had several virgins and about 25% do not bleed or have very little blood... i think it has a lot to do with size (both ways as i am very small...) and masturbation may play a role as well cause some of the tighter ones admitted to having a long history of self manipulation...|`|7xc8jgLXaa	that's true for some (maybe many) women. But not all women bleed their first time. For some, the hymen is already so stretched out from sports, tampons, masturbation, or whatever that sex doesn't stretch the hymen enough to bleed.|`|GOHWnkWPaa	Giggdy...|`|CpevWaQ7aa	For the first time you will bleed but after that you'll be fine|`|AA11967904	He's being a jerk|`|kkipAB1daa	that's not always true, you can be a virgin and not bleed. but don't let him pressure you into having sex if you don't want to. don't let anything he says like he loves you or he'll marry you or you don't really love him if you don't have sex with him fool you. i know a lot of girls that fell for that and then the guy dumped them, so just be careful, i don't want you to get hurt emotionally. also, if he really loved you he would respect your decisions and not try to pressure you into something you didn't want to do wether its sex or something else. it's alot harder to dump a guy or breakup after you have sex with him, so if you're not planning on staying with him for awhile don't have sex with him.|`|DaXBSLtaaa	Honey...wait until you are old enough to know that answer for yourself. There are many risks that come when making the adult decision to having sex...it's not all about pleasure and if you are young, you will not enjoy it as much as you would if you wait until the right time with the right person. having sex means risking pregnancy and STD's...not so glamorous...and think of how your parents would feel if they new...|`|gbKBYDaRaa	that is so not true. every girl does not bleed when they first had sex. so tell him to get his facts straight. i didnt bleed.|`|9F3LGHLCaa	he sounds like a prick dont let him "prick" you|`|99o6heq3aa	some bleed, others dont|`|Va96He2Saa	do it up the ***
10mOHSZTaa	According to my nutritionist, you're underweight if your BMI is below 17.5 or 17; don't remember exactly which. I weigh the same as you but I'm three inches taller, and apparently I'm not underweight.<br>  <br>  If you eat enough and get some exercise, and you maintain that weight, then that's what's healthy for you. Everyone in my family is really tall (my dad is Swedish and my mom's from a long line of tall Slavic and Baltic types) and all of them were really skinny as teenagers. I don't starve myself and I do work out, so my current weight is healthy.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, but if you're in your teens or early 20s, your metabolism will probably slow down when you're around 25 and you'll put on some more weight.<br>  <br>  I'm kind of looking forward to that. I have no cold tolerance and pathetic shoulder muscles that can barely hold themselves up...|`|Y3ghamr7aa	yea I would say so<br>  but ask your doc. just to be sure and see if they can figure out some things to get you back up to an average weight|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Yes.

I used something called a Body Mass Index (BMI) chart. it's a graph/chart that has yur height on the left and yur weight on the top, then u just find the spot on the chart that matches yur height ane weight. at yur hieght it looks like the lowest possible healthy wieght is 120lbs. anything under that is underweight. I have provided the url for the chart so that u can look at it and study it yurself so u can decide wut u wanna do. <a href="http://www.allenobgyn.com/images/BMI-Chart.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.allenobgyn.com/images/BMI-Cha...</a>|`|K119R72Caa	you i think so the chart says for <br>  <br>  Height-<br>  5'7"<br>  <br>  Small Frame-123-136 <br>  Medium Frame-133-147<br>  Large Frame-143-163<br>  <br>  Your around the weight of a small frame 5'3 height.-111-124<br>  Which is unhealthy|`|IvT6AIXtaa	Yeah your underweight but its not unhealthy.

G1eiUqF2aa	see you doctor|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Your parents aren't going to hate you. They only lecture you because they love you and they want you to do well. Go out with your friends on friday nights and saturdays. With that attitude you aren't going to accomplish anything in life. Yes, it's bad.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Do you mean are you "bad" for feeling as you do?  No, given what you say, anyone would be dead not to experience what you describe as a complete bummer.<br>  <br>  However, being younger than older you are perhaps less familiar with the Kirlington of LIfe?  What is the Kirlington of Life?  I'm glad you asked... it's the fact that Life is pain, panic, terror, pain and suffering, and then pain and grief... and the best part is the grief.  All mystics and saints of history have all said the same thing:  The Kirlington of Life is pure hell, and then it gets worse.  So the question is how does one get rid of the Kirlington of Life?<br>  <br>  You must stand on your left leg, facing due east, and placing the ring finger of your right hand on the tip of your nose, while listening to rain through an open window, spit on to a mirror that you have placed on the floor for this purpose, and then quicly thrust your left hand into the air yelling "screw you" world.  This doesn't really eliminate the Kirlington of Life, but the activity is so silly that you either cry or laugh, and the crying is very good for you, and the laughter is OK as well.<br>  <br>  Seriously..... everything you are describing is exterior to you, and it is what is going on within you that is important.  Your are disappointed, sad, and feeling helpless and worthless, right?   Do you realize that each of these allows you to feel "bad"?   You may not realize it but this is how ones ego is presented with humiliation.  And humiliation is the way we gain strength and staying power.  Of course we feel like giving up... but that is our  feeling sorry for ourselves rather than acknowledging how really angry we are that what we wanted to happen is not happening... and we don't know why?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you have to experience what you are experiencing.  The most painful lesson in life is that Life is full of disappointment, and the reason is that this is the play, not Reality.  The Reality is that one is a Soul [and yes there is a God, of which ones Soul is an aspect] but God only watches us, He does not interfere in our performance nor does He judge it.  We are always learning and discovering and right now what you are discovering is to not put so much of yourself in "things" of this physical plane.  A very hard and mostly painful lesson to learn.<br>  <br>  Have you grieved yet?  If not,  do so as soon as you can.  Grief is the one tool God gave Man that is useful beyond imagination. Quite literally grief is the eraser of ones Karma.  The more you grieve, the less negative Karma you have.  <br>  <br>  Peace|`|6d6a92cfa24029ef82993ae689105908aa	How bad it is may depend on how old you are. Getting a C only means there is room for improvement. It is not an excuse to give up.  After all your average is well above a C. You are going through a bad spell, keep going it will all work out, Success is picking yourself up one more time.|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	I feel the exact same way...<br>  People have told me its bad, i guess it is. But no one understands we cant help that feeling...|`|6qsocyK3aa	I think you're maybe mildly depressed but you know that depressed people can help themselves, right? <br>  <br>  Put it into perspective. You could have failed. A C really is perfectly acceptable and add to the 2 A's and 4 B's and... well, it's more than I got and I have a degree (or I will do soon). If your parents lecture you it is likely they just have very high expectations. Tell them you could have done a lot worse and direct their attention to those two fabulous A's you have achieved. I would say that is something to be very proud of.<br>  <br>  So your parents marriage is on the rocks. That is nothing to do with you. As hard as it is, try and keep their issues seperate from yours. There is nothing you can do for them so do your best to put it to the back of your mind. <br>  <br>  If you're having financial problems, you could try a get a job. It would get your out of the house for a start. If you're not willing to do that, start selling things you no longer want or need on eBay. You can make a pretty penny without leaving your bedroom. <br>  <br>  There are steps you can take to make life better for yourself. Councelling and/or medication may help but you will need to see your doctor for that but it should be you who is in charge of what method you take to improve your life anyway. You have problems but nothing huge and nothing you can't sort out. You have a house, food, water, family, an education, which is more than a lot of people in the word. Don't wallow in self-pity when this is something that a) is temporary and b) could be a hell of a lot worse.|`|OJIXRFxMaa	I had the tiniest bit of sympathy reading your second paragraph, forgot the first one. What do you mean you are now an average person now that you got a C? It's like you were thinking yourself as better than people. WHich, is quite sad.  you can accomplish plenty with your life, a C is still a good grade. your grades are very good.<br>  <br>  Talk tos omebody about this, you are the one doing this to yourself, you needt o say "I'm going to do something tonight" enjoy life.|`|5ia8xAuIaa	uh ya i would think its bad, but dont give up. just keep praying because God has a purpose for you. i will keep you in my prayers.|`|moa4kjSFaa	your grades are good?<br>  My life growing up seem 100x worse<br>  then yours. what changed my life <br>  was martial arts, just find an activity<br>  to look forward to <br>  <br>  good luck|`|8UZKW880aa	Yes. <br>  <br>  it is bad that you do not care about your life because, as you've said, the world will not accept you anymore. but, don't loose hope. the door is always open for your dream or dreams. if you always get less a's, moore b's or c's, then ask a friend or someone who can tutor you if you have difficulties in school. you know, I understand of what you are going through. if I were there right by your side, then maybe I can help you a lot. NOW. i'm just like you.i have difficulties in my mathematics subject and when i feel like hope is gone, i try to give up but i don't want to because in life, there is no turning back. i will give and share my favorite quote to you:<br>  <br>  "Keep moving Forward".<br>  <br>  -this means that whenever life takes you, just keep going.<br>  <br>  do not loose Hope!!!!!<br>  <br>  take care.<br>  <br>  may God bless you always.|`|LBB9B8mFaa	Your grades sound pretty good to me and even so many self made businessmen and the rich and famous were failures at school. Some graduates are failures when it comes to life. The focus on facts and figures just stifled their creativity. And how about this:<br>  Einstein wasn't very good at school. His school report said he would never amount to anything. When he graduated from Polytechnic school in Zurich he couldn't even get a job in a university so he went to work in the Swiss Patent office.|`|mJTSHGHXaa	Stop it.. your grades are good. I don't see why it's so bad to be an 'average' person. You are doing this to yourself. You have to get you grip and start making changes in you life and do stuff you like and make you happy. You don't have big problems, your just a little depressed, find help or something. Cause you can have a happy life. You should not just give up. You could have something to look forward. There are people with big problems and sickness who keep on fighting and try to live happy. You should try to be thank full for your life and try to make the best out of it..<br>  So yeah.. it's bad, but you can make it better

V9NGGPP5aa	Sleep inducing compound in brain called as melatonin. It is synthesized from tryptophan, a amino acid. When level of melatonin increases we feel sleepy.|`|9oOFBkR4aa	central nervous system is a organisation it works as its rules|`|flzeVpPNaa	what sanjay written is simple and sweet|`|cWuumdy7aa	During Stage N1 the brain transitions from alpha waves (having a frequency of 8 to 13 Hz, common to people who are awake) to theta waves (with a frequency of 4 to 7 Hz). This stage is sometimes referred to as somnolence, or "drowsy sleep". Associated with the onset of sleep during N1 may be sudden twitches and hypnic jerks also known as positive myoclonus. Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage, which can be troublesome to them. During N1 the subject loses some muscle tone and most conscious awareness of the external environment. <br>  Stage N2, is characterized by "sleep spindles" (12 to 16 Hz) and "K-complexes." During this stage, muscular activity as measured by EMG decreases and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears. This stage occupies 45 to 55% of total sleep in adults. <br>  Stage N3, deep or slow-wave sleep (SWS), is characterized by delta waves, (0.5 to 4 Hz), also called delta rhythms. This is the stage in which such parasomnias as night terrors, bedwetting, sleepwalking and sleep-talking occur. <br>  REM sleep and SWS sleep (previously stages 3 and 4, now combined as stage 3) are both homeostatically driven; that is, people and most animals selectively deprived of one of these stages will rebound once uninhibited sleep is allowed. This finding suggests that both types of sleep are essential.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Due to strain or......
yVfGCdF0aa	Hi.<br>  We have a qualified psychiatric nurse in the house, so I asked her, and she said that although it IS OCD that you have, it doesn't sound like it is serious or problematic at the moment; that's not to say that it isn't affecting your life - I realise that the distraction can be affecting your concentration (in school?) but it isn't seriously getting in the way of your life.<br>  <br>  If you find that you have to, for example, check that the door is locked so often that it makes you unable to go out, then there becomes a problem.<br>  <br>  Everyone gets allusions of pattern and equilibrium, and its stronger for some than others.<br>  <br>  My summary is that if you feel that your OCD is getting in the way of living, seek help, but otherwise, try and live with it as best you can!<br>  Good luck, friend.|`|srfXazvXaa	It sounds like OCD to me, but I'm not a doctor.

J70iEDBhaa	For starters your only 19... Unless you've been heavily drinking since you were 13 I doubt alcohol is to blame. As for weed being to blame, I think its because you stopped smoking! Number one reason young men masterbate is because of boredom.. if that's the case then you should find something else to do with yourself. no pun intended  :) If your dizzy alot then it probably has to do with something else. I don't know what your other problems are so I cant really give a better explanation. But as for Alcohol and Weed.. I really really doubt they have anything to do with your problems.|`|AA11785060	You have mental illness if you really believe masturbation causes all your ills.

In my own experience (which may be entirely unlike yours, of course!) , changing from one medication to another was not such a big thing: it was just part of an ongoing process of tinkering with a 'cocktail' of medications, until I found a combination that worked well for me.<br>  <br>  You're wise to realize that your condition affects the way you do your work, and that some sort of change is necessary.<br>  <br>  Have a good talk with your doctor. S/he would probably be able to give you much of the information you need to know, like the effects of changing meds, and legislation and practice about employment and illness.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	You'd have to read over your contract and maybe talk to your boss about it.

Just take some time for yourself, you're not getting anywhere by going to work and coming home. If you're not mentally stable to be at work, then he might fire you anyway.

3Y00AC7Zaa	Hello, Do what I did. No snacks , just breakfast lunch and dinner. Loads of water. Breakfast was yoghurt and strawberries, lunch was tuna and salad, dinner was fish and veges and two litres of water per day. I lost 3 kilos in first week. I felt thin because I lost weight....|`|exu6Mc6Paa	You can't. You should motivate yourself to hit the gym after work and work out for an hour or so. And eat healthy stuff, don't consume more than 1500 calories a day. Good luck|`|SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  What do you call thin? You don′t have time to exercise? I am afraid it will be hard for you to reach your goal.<br>  Realistically speaking you can drop anywhere from 1-5 pounds or so in a week, depending on how active you are and on what you eat. <br>  <br>  Dieting should be considered a long term project. Take the time to do this over a realistic time frame and then your results will be more likely to be permanent. That is what you want, isn′t it?<br>  <br>  Educate yourself on diet. What constitutes a healthy diet? Read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.lifeclinic.com/focus/nutrition/food-pyramid.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeclinic.com/focus/nutritio...</a><br>  <br>  You also need to exercise. You can jog, ride a bike or lift weights. I recommend lifting weights, you can train more muscles systematically that way.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|QmWO1Kfbaa	Tighten the corset strap on a daily basis .|`|05SVYlXBaa	have a yoghurt for breakfast, a strawberry angel delight mixed with pieces of banana for lunch, drink loads of water and just steamed vegetables for lunch. cut out wheat completely and processed foods. the results will be amazing|`|e8FiZHkRaa	you can't.

No coffee, only herbal tea. I felt great. I walked every day and started to run by the end of the first week. No alcohol. After magazine  shoot, I kept up the 3 meals and I feel great.

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.
6j9Lb83Caa	yes and no, it really depends on your body, see as you already know birth control controls your hormones, how you grow, and protects you from becoming pregnet, and also it regulates your menstrul cycles. So really it depends on first what type of birth control you are on, how you use the birth control, and what body type you have, you should really check in with your doctor incase you are worried about your brests becoming larger than you want them to be.|`|K5SGG1QYaa	it makes them get a little bigger, plus it makes you gain weight which makes your boob bigger too. i've gone up two cupsizes but i'm the same dress size. i think thats pretty rare though, most of my friends boobs got a little bigger but not enough to change their bra size.|`|4gC38fKsaa	you can eat anti-estrogen foods that will stop your boobs from increasing in size. google them. plus they have a nice side effect of helping with muscle tone.
LbNXxRXnaa	Well I don't really like having them. They are really painful :/ I just got them on Thursday. On the plus side, my teeth will be straighter in 1 year and 8 months!|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. I don't like braces because so children/adults have them or have gotton them I think in many cases because everyone wants straight teeth. I respect if an adult wants to get them, but let the child choose if they like their teeth that are shaped uniquely or if they want perfectly straight teeth like so many others. I was asked by my dentist if I wanted braces and I said no. I get so many compliments of a tooth that is uniquely crooked. It's true. I also feel comfortable I am me and not trying to look like everyone else. You will make your own decision. Good luck & Peace|`|R4Ij1u0Baa	I love them because they make teeth perfect and straight! I had horrible teeth and I got braces which made my teeth perfect which gave me tons of confidence. So when I see people with braces, I think that they are gunna have one beautiful smile after. Its pain full, but sooo damn worth it.|`|xdnlLSuuaa	They are a bit uncomfortable after the first two days or so, but then they get better and they are easier to manage after awhile.

aScgVDZ1aa	1.  Hives are caused by an allergic reaction, loratadine tablets are basically clariton.  You could try taking benydrll which tends to work faster, and be more specific -- it works as an anti-histamine which blocks histamines from causing the immune response.  The nice thing about benydrll is that it will also help for bug bites too.  As for the why, we are not really sure why you can eat a piece of shell fish one day and the next develop an allergy.  Perhaps there is a threshold you have to cross before the body becomes intolerant to it.  (i had a similar experience with latex, after wearing gloves for years, all of the sudden I was allergic to it)  Please be aware that I'm not a doctor, so ask for advice from them.|`|h5Xk5VhJaa	drink more water than usual to flush what ever it is out of your system faster.

However as I said, if you are worried and scared about having sex, then you are not ready.<br>  <br>  You'll know when you are ready.<br>  <br>  Take care hun|`|X6aRNbqKaa	Think hard and long about if your really want to have sex and why. Don't do it just cause you are bored or he wants you to or cause you feel you "love" him. Make sure your feelings are real and you can handle the consequences of the choices you make. Pregnancy is one, but mostly if you two break up, can you handle the stress of that. Sex connects two people in most cases. The woman can feel a lot more connection than the guy. So, you must do it for the right reasons, which when you find those you will know when it is time. Don't let him persuade you, let your heart decide what you want to do. More than likely he won't be the one around forever, no offense.<br>  <br>   For your question...it might hurt might not. It will probably be awkward and don't worry if things don't work the first time you do it, it takes practice.|`|SelQcjdiaa	hey u need nt 2 worry it may pan but u vl have pleasure in it.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Sweetie,are you sure you are ready to lose your virginity to someone you barely know?<br>  I mean 3 months isn't exactly a lifetime?:)<br>  Please please please,think more carefully about this- You might regret it in the future (lots of girls do).<br>  You might not even be physically ready- just wait couple more months.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	3 months really is not long at all, you'll regret it.<br>  <br>  ...what if the condom breaks?

Don't think about it like that..all it does is stress you out. Just ask yourself this...<br>  <br>  1. "Am I REALLY ready to have sex, or can I honestly wait?"<br>  2. "Does my boyfriend respect ALL my feelings?"<br>  3. "Have I known my boyfriend long enough to allow my sacred body to be opened up to him like this?"<br>  <br>  Sex is not everything.. but becareful.<br>  If your boyfriend really loves you and respects you.. you really wouldn't be asking this question because you'd have that trust that if in the event it DOES hurt you, you'll already know he'll be gentle and he will be aware of your feelings and you wouldn't be asking people on the internet.<br>  <br>  Trust yourself. Listen to yourself and your heart.

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	Any time a person's (I say person rather than patient because you do not say as to whether these lenses were fit professionally by a qualified doctor or whether you got them at some flea market somewhere) vision gets blurry after wearing contact lenses there is cause for concern.  This means the lens is interfering in the metabolism of the cornea of the eye.  The blurriness is probably occurring because the cornea is edematous (swollen).  If your vision does not clear promptly or the eye becomes painful you should go in and have this looked at.  If it clears promptly you are probably ok for now but you need to have this looked at before you try to wear the lenses again.<br>  <br>  p.s. You should NEVER wear a contact lens that has not been professionally fit by a qualified doctor.|`|6u07c7Hraa	could be serious i would go to the doctor asap just to be sure!!
BGRaT8jTaa	Your man boobs are going no place because you fail to understand the meaning of proper cardiovascular...ok....dude...walking around is a waiste of time. Get your *** into a weight room....do 4 sets of benching, arms, militart press and leg workouts....and do some running at least 3 to 4 times a week. You are trying to get rid of those boobs on the lazy cheap. if you do what I say and cut back on fast food by 70%, at the least you'll start seeing results in two and one half weeks...your cardio is too high and you are not doing enough work to take it down.....if yu don't want to lift weights...do 3 to 4 sets of pushups 3 to 4 times per week building up to 5o or so each set. You might not be able to do but 10 when you start off but build up...eaither way, you will see dramatci results very quickly...throw in some creatine and you'll be on the cover of sexy man ***** mag in no time...<br>  4 minutes ago - Edit - Delete|`|Likst1Mxaa	Seriously... go do some weight training. If your local gym does Body Pump, do that... they have sections specifically for the chest area. Weight training will help HEAPS.<br>  <br>  If you work out at home you might get equipment which is not right for you and what you want to do with it. Try signing up at a gym for a few months. If you don't like it, cancel your membership. But you'll learn heaps about how to train to tone up your chest and then you could exercise at home (if you really wanted to).|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Go and see your doctor. They could be caused by going through puberty. Your hormones go crazy and it is not uncommon for boys to develop small breasts, which once your body sorts itself out, disappear.<br>  But at your weight it sounds like general fat. You need to exercise more and eat less, or eat the right sort of food. The treadmill will burn calories, not sure what the ball will do. It might add strength, but not sure how it would burn calories. Go and see your doctor anyway.

aScgVDZ1aa	This will effect three diagnostic factors.  First, as she has a fever, her body is fighting an infection.  CBC tests measure the following, and this will be how they will change, depending on the type of infection<br>  <br>  1.  White Blood Cell Count<br>  Neutrophils/Macrophages = First responders, involved in Non Specific Infections - meaning that it will respond to anything that doesn't belong in the body.  Elevated due to infection<br>  <br>  B-Cells - Fight Bacterial infections, if she has a bacterial infection these will be elevated, (although it may not show if she just came down with the infection)  <br>  <br>  T-Cells - These fight Viruses, they are specific per disease.  These will be elevated if she has a viral infection<br>  <br>  ESR - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate- This test is a measure of non-specific inflammation - This will be elevated in inflammation (result of infection) or other types of diseases that cause inflammation - such as RA, Lymphoma, Lupus etc.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I would wait for a week, to make sure any viruses/bacterial have been cleared.  However, if she is having a CBC test in response to whatever she is having, it would be important to have the test.  Best advice is to inform your doctor and let them decide whether or not it is advisable (depending on what she's having the test for) to have the blood test.  BTW:  When you have a fever, you are generally infectious, and no one wants her sick, so she should stay home!|`|XK0kZ8Iiaa	A CBC will help tell the doc whether she has a bacterial infection or a virus.  Would be good for her to have the CBC and see the doc too. Tylenol helps better with the fever but dont over do the tylenol because of posssible liver damage.And she needs to drink plenty of fluids because a fever is dehydrating. And also get some rest.|`|o2ytHMu5aa	If she isn't feeling well, don't go because when you're sick, your brain doesn't work well. You are blurr in what you are doing.

aScgVDZ1aa	he incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) varies from isolated cases to nursery epidemics. The population group most often affected is ill, preterm neonates.5<br>  <br>  The incidence rates of necrotizing enterocolitis are similar in all developed countries in which high-quality health care is available for premature infants.<br>  <br>  The incidence in premature neonates is highest in those with very low birth weights.6 NEC is less commonly seen in premature neonates with higher birth weights and in _Full-term neonates.<br>  <br>  Currently, the mortality rate of patients with necrotizing enterocolitis is less than 20% when infants are treated early in the course of the illness. Without treatment, the mortality rate is extremely high.<br>  <br>  Morbidity associated with NEC includes bowel stricture, peritoneal adhesions, and bowel perforation. If perforation occurs, the necrotic bowel is surgically resected. Resection of large lengths of bowel may result in short-bowel syndrome.<br>  <br>  Necrotizing enterocolitis exhibits no sexual predilection.

Too many kids in our world don't get enough time with their parents because parents are trying to survive the economy and other crap.<br>  There is nothing wrong with having a ps2 and having kids.<br>  That is the least of our worries... it's just a devise that is always and only an earned privilege to play it. I control what is played on it and for how long. FYI we play educational games as fun and play.. yes, there is such a thing as educational ps2 games for kids. They still get to say they play games but they're still learning and having fun at the same time!<br>  <br>  In the God Willing event that you have any kids... please consider adopting them out to a fun and humorous, adventurous, very financially stable person.....!  If you need help with that... let me know. I know a lot of fun and humorous, adventurous and very financially stable people! <br>  <br>  Thank you.. buh bye now!!!  =[]

Y42J2P2Naa	Eye twitching, or myokymia, is an involuntary eyelid muscle contraction that usually affects the lower eyelid. The exact cause of an eyelid twitch is unknown. A twitch sometimes develops during times of increased stress. Twitching has also been associated with high caffeine intake, fatigue or excessive squinting. It can also occur after reading or working on a computer for prolonged periods of time. '<br>  <br>  An eyelid twitch is usually a sign that you need to take a break and relax. Sometimes a twitch will go away following a good night's sleep, but a stubborn twitch may last as long as three weeks.<br>  <br>  If the twitching involves both eyes, there is a possibility that you have blephorospasm. This is a chronic condition that is more common in women over 50. Blephorospasm can progress into repeated forceful closing of the eyes. Again, there is no definite cause, but it may be worsened by stress, bright lights, watching too much TV, and fatigue.
0TT5q0cUaa	sauna slim belts are rubbish. you should consult a nutrition expert or dietician before doing any form of diet. good luck.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	its sh it , sauna belt dont buy it , it wont make you loose any weight at all.  Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|oke9WHZUaa	call to tele match or visit its website

You need to go to bed same time every night and wake up same time every morning. You need to train yourself to sleep. If you don't allow yourself to sleep cos of the dreams, then you need to see a professional to get to cause of these dreams or you need just get over it cos it's only a dream.

J.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	A number of elements you have listed, but essentially they all revolve around one thing.  You have no idea who or what you are and as a consequence of this you are caught up in a great deal of thinking... and your MIND is using this to   beat you up.... because a part of yourself believes you deserve to be beat up.<br>  <br>  Let us  begin with who and what you are:  You are  a Perfect Soul, just like everyone else.  Between what you think and your Soul is your MIND. Your MIND holds a great many misperceptions it took on at the time of your birth, and these helped form your personality and your fully non-conscious self-view.<br>  <br>  At the time of your death at the close of your last life you went before a "judge" and together the two of you went over how well you did working on your Fate Karma for that life.  Then you designed a Fate Karma for this life, and this included what you wanted to  experience in this life... and this is what you are complaining about now.<br>  <br>  What you experience and "think" about is what you must rise above, and not be overwhelmed by.   Take some time for yourself and forget about other people except to nod to as you pass by them.  Take a piece of paper and jot down a few things that you really would like to learn, do or discover.  Pick the one that holds the most interest for you and head for the library.  Begin learning everything you can about that subject, topic, or thing.  Do this with as much intensity as you can muster.  And put all your attention and energy into this... until you begin to Know this thing like your own name.<br>  <br>  The point?  You need to discover that what you think is BS.   And what you think will always be BS.  So stop thinking.  Seriously stop thinking about anything... and just be.  Focus on this new thing you are learning and become it for a while.  As you gain Knowledge the Knowledge becomes you... and this if far more important that who you misperceive yourself to be... what your MIND uses to beat you up.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|9ea0d9539a51a75360c7af650ac8397baa	My brother killed himself, and i can only ask you to think of the impact you will leave on the ones you leave behind, because believe me, that pain never ever eases.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you go to your doctor and also ask to speak to a counsellor or similiar, there is more information on the website www.recoveryourlife.com it helped me through some dark times.<br>   <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world, and am thinking of you.|`|AA11070782	I also have problems with socialising and talking to people. I have the same problem of not knowing what to say to people. Although the problem has improved a bit with my confidence getting better over the years. I have anxiety, depression and OCD. Just because you have trouble talking to other people and can't come up with witty remarks, certainly doesn't make you worthless, you are probably having trouble with socialising because you have depression, low self esteem, low confidence etc. It is possible to feel better about your self again and become more confident again. Please don't hurt your self. people wouldn't be better of with out you, it would hurt them very much especially your family. Talk to a family member you feel comfortable with about how your feeling, talk to a school councillor, talk to your Doctor about finding a councillor you can talk to. Also I use an alternative therapy which has helped me a lot with some of my problems. It's called Emotional Freedom Technique. These are some websites about it.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	I know many will disagree with me, but you need to get to your GP asap and ask for some medication.  Once you feel a little better you can start to arrange therapy.  This won't go away on it's own.  It needs to be dealt with.  I can empathise with everything you have said.  I was first depressed when I was 12 and now I'm 30.  A good counsellor will definitely help you, but first you need a little bit of relief from the pain and anguish of battling with every day life.  You need to be able to take a breather.  I hope things start to progress towards a more peaceful life for you soon.  x|`|G1eiUqF2aa	sleep!|`|2g1KEptwaa	I used to be in your situation, I mean with your symptoms but also not knowing why it should be so.<br>  The reason you are that way is because of ABUSE in childhood. The form of it could be anything, but what has happened is parts of your psyche are STUNNED, and if you don't seek help, they will STAY stunned. This info is not in any books--I had to find it out by myself, by going through group therapy. The idea of being emotionally stunned was not told to me, as it's hard to grasp.<br>  Seek professional help--the real you (the full, contented, attractive and easy you) is stuck inside. I could go on forever, but it's hard to get your head around, as I said. Seek a therapist via your doctor, and tell them how you feel.<br>  Don't do what I did, and see a hypnotist. DON'T do that. You're not ready to have all your issues spill out at once. Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT--Jo Ann M's advice about bridging medication is spot on. Another point about the suicidal feelings (AS they're not there all the time) is go to bed! Say to yourself "It's just feelings--feelings can't kill you". If you get some sleep, then great. If not, then the quietness of your bed is also therapeutic, in the short term.|`|6507eb67b40c198c7f9e69ac4296c97faa	Firstly, i've been in your position for some time, so i empathise completely. You will receive lots of advice on this, some good and some bad.<br>  <br>  The first thing is DO NOT do anything stupid, i.e. suicide. As an earlier contributor has already said, it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS!<br>  <br>  I've been on medication, and whilst it worked to a degree, I found that making myself busy, keeping myself occupied and not allowing myself time to think about the negatives worked far better. Try to remove yourself from any situations that you know when these thoughts will come along.<br>  <br>  Look at your life, try to put things into perspective, and think of some things that you would enjoy doing. I'm not talking about dreams such as unaffordable far flung holidays and stuff like that, but realistic, achievable goals. Start with small things. Swimming, do you have a dog you could walk etc? Set yourself little targets that you can reach and then try to better each time. Again, not massive leaps but just small steps. When you achieve your small targets, you will feel better about yourself, and your feeling of self worth will grow at the same time.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't wallow in self pity, as this will just drive you into the depths.<br>  <br>  Finally, do see your family doctor. Just be aware that there is no instant "happy pill" that will cure this straight away, most medication for this type of condition is quite gradual in its effects over a couple of weeks, but you definitely need some professional intervention as well as helping yourself.<br>  <br>  Life's to valuable to throw it away, think about yourself, and think of the pain and anguish of those you would leave behind. More people care about you than you probably think at this stage.<br>  <br>  Very good luck to you, stick with it.<br>  <br>  ****It seems that somebody is hell bent on giving everyone else's answer the thumbs down on this thread, probably in the misguided belief that only they know the solution. Only you can decide which is the right way for you, so take no notice, extract what you can and get yourself better.****|`|CmPvZ6Ucaa	<a href="http://suicidehotlines.com/national.html" rel="nofollow">http://suicidehotlines.com/national.html</a><br>  <br>  hey, i know i don't know you, but i just want you to know that despite the people you hang around with, there are a lot of people who will be willing to talk to you about your thoughts. i know you may feel worthless but in my opinion, not to weird you out or anything, everyone is here for a reason and nothing in life is random. I also understand that you feel awkward around the people you hang around with, but i want you to realize that everyone is different, including how social people are. and i totally understand how you care about what other people think of you, i always have and probably always will, but i always remember my family and the few good friends i have and i put them before me, they would be totally lost without me, i definitely think you should try a suicide hot line or find a counselor, you may not like opening up to people, but they wont judge you, they have their job for a reason and i am 100% sure that they will help you out. <br>  <br>  i may not have been a big help but i want you to know you'll be in my thoughts.<br>  <br>  sincerely,<br>  -me|`|P6fVoXb1aa	I'm thinking exactly like you at the moment too. <br>  I can't really help you because i don't know much about you or your background.

Phone an anonymous councelling service. Tell someone who you trust. Talk to your Dr. They will understand and have the network of professionals who can help you.

It is treatable, but you can't do it alone and if you feel that you're family or friends will tell you you're being stupid and deal with it - TALK TO SOMEONE who will listen and understand.

You need to see your doctor and talk to them about how you have been feeling. They should give you some medication to help with the dealings of day to day life. Then you can arrange to talk to someone about your feelings. It definitely wont go away by itself and certainly not over night either. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember but never recognized the signs till 4 years ago. I am now constantly on and off medication. Which I admit I am not proud of but if it makes it easier to cope with each day as it comes then I feel much better about stuff and about myself. <br>  Taking your life wont actually solve anything like people think it does. You actually have a lot more people out there that care for you greatly and would miss you if you did take you life. Please don't wait till its too late to go to the doctor.  <br>  plus, it sounds like the people you are trying to become friends with arent worth it. No one should be made to feel as if they are an idiot by anyone. I would also look elsewhere for friends. Try finding a group or a club that intrests you. You will at least have something to talk about with these people. And it will help to keep you busy and your mind off the stresses of life. <br>  I wish you the greatest of luck for the future.|`|oiB4KATuaa	Eep! you sound just like me! Well the way I did a while ago...firstly dont think of the suicidal thoughts, life changes you know, its hard to think of that when you are depressed, but I found that is the best way to deal with depression, change things, change your job, change your school, change where you live, change your friends or start doing something you dont do at the moment, join a class or a volunteer group, if someone had said this to me when I was depressed I would have just thought it was a stupid idea, but you just need something to throw a spanner in the works of the depression spiral...I care alot about what people think of me too, and I think thats why I had trouble saying things or making jokes because I was worried it would come out wrong and I think people can sense your anxiety and I think they can also sense when you dont like yourself either and so they dont...but it really is about thinking about the positives and not trying to change yourself over night and it comes down to accepting who you are, like I wanted to be the loud, funny happy person, I thought that was 'normal' but its not, not for me, I just have to accept that I'm a quiet, but still friendly, happy person and I have nothing against quiet people so why should I think badly of myself? So with me I guess it got to a point where I thought everyone I met hated me, noone wanted to talk to me, I was stupid and ugly etc etc and I got more and more withdrawn so I had to set little goals, like eg. I would chat with the cashier at the super market next time or you could think of a subject and say next time I see such and such I'm going to start talking about 'this', think of things to say before you meet people, and if all else fails keep asking them questions about themselves, people like talking about themselves! But dont be suicidal, life does change and just try to accept yourself and think of ways around problems, dont let them drag you down, you said yourself that you're a nice person, so thats a good start! I bet there's alot of good about you that you probably hide due to fear of people not liking you, so yeah..start small and dont be so hard on yourself if it doesn't work out, you are worthy of this world!|`|srfXazvXaa	I understand exactly how you feel!  Remember all the good things in you r life though, like how yummy your favorite food is, how pretty it is outside and listen to the birds sing, call a good friend and thank God he or she is there for you.  Write a list of all the things you are grateful for and keep going till you feel better.  Distract yourself from those thoughts by doing something else(for me its cleaning or jumping on the computer and watching something funny or answering a few questions. (on answers).  Many people feel insecure and like we don't have what others do in the humor dept or in intellect, but we can all be valuable to other in some way.  Help someone out in some way.  Maybe some volunteer work.  If you go help feed the homeless, you'll see just how great you've got it and feel so much better.  Most of all, know that God loves you and He put you here for a good reason and only He should decide when you leave.  Love u!!
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|4fAikyfDaa	there is an healthys aproach of loosing weight most of people don't know about it.<br>  Why you can't lose weight, it is not related to your will-power, over-eating or diet, the fact you are fat and unhealthy because you have Disgusting plaque and horrible little Critters living in your guts.<br>  But you can get ride of all of it so you can shed up to 100 lbs or more<br>  Everybody has this harmful plaque but if you want to keep from getting sick and to be able to have a healthy body weight you must get ride of it now.<br>  If you don't you won’t be able to lose weight (regardless of how you diet and exercise!) and eventually it will kill you.<br>  You can get more info about this aproach in this website The Top Secret Of Fat Loss (<a href="http://www.thetopsecretoffatloss.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetopsecretoffatloss.com)</a> and even you can buy the book called Top secret of fat loss<br>  Good Luck|`|s7YoWbRcaa	1. Become more active. The amount of muscle a person has is a very strong determinant in the ability to burn calories and shed fat. So it goes without saying that exercise is essential. Build strength and resistance by working out at least twice a week, preferably with weights. Do easy exercises in between workouts. Simple tasks such as walking the dog and using the stairs in place of the elevator can take off calories. The key is to match the amount of eating to the amount of activity one has.<br>  <br>  2. Don't skip breakfast. This is the most important meal of the day. Surprisingly, the ones who eat breakfast are thinner than the ones who do not. Metabolism can slow down considerably if breakfast is taken during mid-morning or if one waits until the afternoon to eat.<br>  <br>  3. Eat smaller meals. It is advisable to consume 4 to 6 small meals that are timed 2 to 3 hours apart.<br>  <br>  4. Avoid sugar - it's addictive. Sugar enables the body to store fat. A person should eat food that helps sustain an even level of blood-sugar. Additionally, exercising 2-3 times a week should be in order to stabilize blood sugar.<br>  <br>  5. Eat spicy foods and include more energy foods in the diet. Spicy meals with peppers can increase the metabolism. Energy foods include fruit, vegetables, beans and whole grains.<br>  <br>  6. Plan meals in advance. Always prepare the right amount of food to be consumed at the regular intervals. Don't snack between meals.<br>  <br>  7. Never skip meals. People tend to skip meals in order to lose weight, which is a big mistake since it slows down metabolism.<br>  <br>  8. Get enough sleep. According to research, it is riskier for people who do not get enough sleep to gain weight. Also, muscles are regenerated during the last couple of hours of slumber.<br>  <br>  9. Drink plenty of water. Water flushes out toxins that are produced whenever the body burns fat. The majority of bodily functions involve water, and lack of water causes the body system's operations to decrease its speed, and produces unneeded stress as a result.<br>  <br>  10. Ditch the stress! Stress, whether it’s physical or emotional, triggers the release of a steroid called cortisol, which decreases metabolism. Also, people tend to eat excessively when stressed.<br>  <br>  Achieving the desired body weight is never impossible if one has the determination and patience needed to stabilize the metabolism level, which plays an important role in weight loss. A person needs to realize that eating right and working out should be a way of life and not something you do for a few months before going back to old eating habits.
TC21ao0Paa	She is quite ill and in danger of becoming dehydrated, which she probably is . She needs to seek medical attention NOW !! If your Doc's office is closed, then bring her to the emergency room, NOW !<br>  In the meantime, give her ice chips ( just smash some ice cubes) to suck on, small sips of Gatorade, clear liquids in small amounts ( water chix broth).Do not give her large gulps of  liquids. Avoid foods that are heavy for her tummy.You can give her small bits of banana. Space out in between giving her liquids and any foods to see if she can tolerate them.Treat her fever with liquid Tylenol mixed with applesauce. Do NOT use a suppository as this can stimulate her bowels to move. <br>  Tepid ( warm) baths to cool down her body. Avoid using hot or cold water her bath.<br>  <br>  Doc ASAP !! I hope that she gets well soon.|`|tV7YYXssaa	I hope you took her to the doctors.  You can't assume it is a virus.  It could be something more serious.  Also when you are dehydrated, you could throw up more.  It is also dangerous if she is dehydrated.  I would take her to the emergency room right away.  She must feel awful.  Don't take any chances.  They will probably give her IV fluids.  She may feel better then.  They may also take blood to check for other things.  Please do this for her.  Please let me know how she is.<br>  cmgoggins@rocketmail.com<br>  Good Luck|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Yes, get her to the Dr. and get her some help. The fact that it is continuing and she is in pain with tummy cramps is a red flag to seek help. It is probably a stomach virus but in a young child you shouldn't take the risk of her becoming dehydrated from vomiting & diarreah. It can be dangerous. In the meantime, try giving her Pediolyte popsicles or drink because it will help keep her hydrated. But PLEASE, take her to the Dr. or emergency room TODAY!|`|Tk4C0kh8aa	Poor baby. She probably has a version of the stomach influenza as you probably guessed. The vomiting and stomach cramping is normal, but if it goes on for longer than five days, you should seek more medical help from a certified professional. Try feeding her weak tea, chicken broth, and saltine crackers. Sprite may help with her stomach cramping, and make sure that she doesn't over-exert herself. Make sure you give her lots of love and that she rests a lot! Hope I helped.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	keep her extra warm, give her soup and oranges to eat.|`|d1862ba8e4c727c54e3035f0293c5a14aa	My son had a bad flu and we ended up having to take him to the doctor and she put him in the hospital because he got so lethargic from not drinking. Everytime I gave him something to drink he would throw it up. If it gets to the point where you think she's lethargic, then I really think you should take her to the ER. They can give her an IV and she'll bounce back. They probably also will give her antibiotics in the IV. If I remember right, they didn't want me to give him anything for a period of time till the stomach settled down because he would just throw up again and the stomach had to heal. It couldn't hurt to take her to the ER or even better, if you have one of those Walgreen clinics or I think walmart might have some too. They deal with the flu with less cost. Hang in there. I know how hard it is to see your little one go through the pain.

Who is terrified?  You or the dark? Now close your eyes and what do you see?  Wow, there's nothing but dark, right?  As soon as you close your eyes what you say terrifies you is all you see.....  But are you terrified at closing your eyes?<br>  <br>  So it is not the dark that terrifies you, it is something else and you use the dark to make "responsible" for what you fear.  The fear resides within your MIND.  It is not in the dark, it is within your own MIND.  <br>  <br>  Now ask yourself who and what you are?  Don't know?  That's OK because hardly anyone knows who and what they are?  You are  a Soul at your Core, as is every human being.  Your Soul is Perfect, and it is composed of Neutral Spiritual Energy, and this Energy is an Absolute Energy in that it is permanent, cannot be harmed in any way and is an aspect of God.<br>  <br>  So, what you are doing in life is being a Soul that is exploring and experiencing Life.  Like Shakespeare said, the world is a stage and we are all players on that stage.  The Purpose of Life is to do Karma, and the basic Law of Karma is: As you sow, so shall you reap.  This means that there is nothing [and I mean absolutely nothing] that can happen to you that is not due you.  So the fear you experience is misplaced and is based on some misperception stored within your MIND. It feels real and so you assume it is.  It is not real.... and even if there was something in the dark to get you, you cannot be gotten unless you are supposed to be gotten... in which case there is nothing you can do about it, so why worry about it?<br>  <br>  Peace|`|VuGPufs4aa	there is nothing more in the dark then there is in the daylight.the thing that scares you is that you see very little in the dark. sleep with a flash light.get over it

However, some people get little cysts in that area.  It could be caused from your deodorant, from shaving too closely and the bumps become inflamed. It's best to avoid using deodorant immediately after shaving your underarm, which is why I shave at night so that I can use deodorant the next day.  <br>  <br>  Cysts are just pus or fluid filled sacs that can be quite uncomfortable. They are not normally cancerous and the doctor can remove the fluid in the office. <br>  <br>  Since you stated that you got it around the time of your period, I think  it's probably cysts, which have a tendency to flare up more during that time when your hormones are doing crazy things.

MY answer is No you wouldnt, so u should have some modesty and shame. If you leave something against ur nafs (desires) Insha'Allah Allah will provide u with something better (i,e a religious wife). Sex is not everything. You have religious duties to do and in sex u will only shoot out semen for like what 20 secs? Having patient and not masturbating and not having sex before marriage is so evil (dont come near it meaning dont masturbate - this is said several time that it is very evil).

If you want to masturbate then go ahead, its one known method of relieving stress. Whoever you follow, whether it is Allah or God, or whoever,  i doubt he would send you to hell for masturbating. And by the way, the chances of you dying while masturbating are very slim. anyways hope you found what you were looking for.|`|Up1MrXI3aa	i don't normally get involved in religious matters since these are beliefs people hold dear. nearly all religious organizations consider masturbation a sin. this is because of their interpretation of agent documents. it comes from them believing that the only time we are suppose to engage in any sexual activity is when trying to reproduce after marriage. my personal belief is that the true message was confused over time. my reason for this is that men must ejaculate just as women have a period. each day your body makes more sperm and semen. if you don't release it, it builds up and could cause health problems. this is the reason some guys have wet dreams. so if you go 5 months, i'm surprised you didn't already have a wet dream, you have a lot of old sperm and semen that your body is telling you to get rid of. I personally don't believe that God would design us in a way that it was required to do to stay healthy and then prevent us from doing it.|`|khgwEYfQaa	god would not have give you the equipment to give so much pleasure if he didn't want you to use it.<br>  <br>  you are denying yourself. <br>  <br>  to masturbate is a natural urge. all guys do it whether, whatever their religion even if they deny it. and why shouldn't they? go ahead. have fun.<br>  ?|`|uF7In6yoaa	i would trust adeeb, try to get ur mind of those things, u havent done it for 5 months, good job, go play sports, keep urself busy<br>  <br>  and dont think about girls in "that" way|`|dKwLXjYiaa	i think it's a sin for christians too <br>  do it without realizing or else you were aware|`|ZXPXepumaa	lol..you will be fine.

AA10299265	Metformin (Glucophage) is the usual drug of choice. Be aware, however, that the drug is only an aid to help your body utilize its own insulin. It's not a cure for poor eating and exercise habits.

a79f0c5fe352cad80245dd19d3ff128eaa	Eliminate fatty foods, such as carbs and sugars. Stick with salads and fruit and vegetables. Heathly and for the most part low in calories. Eliminate sugary drinks such as all types of sodas and juices. Stick with water mostly.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	I do not recommend low carb diets, this is not the best way to lose weight, it is unstable. These diets usually substitute carbs with proteins (like Atkins), you will feel malnourished and once you throw the diet the pounds will go back on almost as quickly as they came off. Not good for the body's metabolism as it will crash.<br>  <br>  Rice and pasta are excellent course of complex carbohyrates which you need a minimum amount every day. They are easy for the body to absorb and give you a lot of energy. <br>  The foods you should be eliminating are processed foods, sugary drinks, sodas, animals fats, full fat milk and cream which are high in saturated fats, these foods are harder for the body to break down so they are stored as fats.|`|xERwr6Ukaa	The best thing to do is completely cut out all trans fats.<br>  Trans fats are extremely bad for you, they are found in a lot of boxed foods such as:<br>  *Mac N' Cheese<br>  * Hamburger Helper<br>  *Fruit gushers<br>   and many other foods, but thankfully many people have cut them out of the foods, but there are many that have the trans fats in the foods.<br>  I would suggest eating plenty of whole grains, and try not to eat and white grain products. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and watch out for the gound meat, try deer or turkey meat instead.<br>  I hope this helped!|`|OdvWnBC8aa	Try cutting back on them, but do not eliminate them entirely.  Eliminating them entirely will just make you want them more!  If you try cutting back on them you will probably see a higher success rate.  Try to eat a lot of protein, calcium, fruits and veggies!  And choose fruits and veggies that are rich in color - they generally have less starch and are better for you.  Good luck!|`|KxqV7CM7aa	Don't follow all the fads! I can lose weight in a heartbeat with one simple rule. Firstly, any fatty foods you want, eat them at breakfast. Lunch should be vegetables and fiber as it cleans out the morning foods and lessens bloat (though initially you will be more bloated as your body gets used to higher fiber). At night eat your smallest meal and again eat protein or fiber or best yet a combination and for dessert eat something like an activia and a banana. Cut out high carbs and sugary food other than fruits! It is a sure fire way to lose weight!|`|lKsgF8bOaa	Carbs and fatty food.|`|rJPBF33taa	Rice/Pasta...you are on the right track.  The carbohydrates in these foods are HUGE.  Be cautious and consult a physician.<br>  GOOD LUCK.

It is possible, but wait until the results come out before doing anything.  If he is negative for surface antigen then have him get the vaccine.  If he is surface antigen positive or core antibody positive, he would need medication.  Good thing about Hep B compared to Hepatitis C is that as long as you are not HIV positive and the strain of HepB is E antigen postivie, it is possible to treat with a 6 month to 1 year regiment of entecavir without needing lifelong treatment.|`|RHCUtrxnaa	Not to add to your concerns, but yes, you can give it to your man. Heb, A, B, C are the most common and reside in blood and other body fluids. Having sex is the the most common way to spread hepatitis.

iAv9P3HTaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  You are having panic attacks.<br>  Use these simple steps over and over again until you become the master of your thoughts and emotions.You create your panic attacks not your environment .<br>  Take full responsibility.<br>  <br>  I was suffering from panic attacks for 14 years.<br>  I did a lots of research and reading on the subject.<br>  <br>  Here is a six-step approach to self-control when dealing with an  anxiety attack:<br>  <br>  1.ACCEPT--Recognize that you are feeling anxious.Accept your body feelings as a symptom of your anxiety and a sign that something is bothering you.<br>  <br>  2.PERMISSION--Give yourself permission to feel anxious about whatever it is that is bothering you."Of course I feel anxious because.... and it is okay to have anxiety.I know what this is and why I feel this way."<br>  <br>  3.BREATHE-- First, inhale through your nose slowly for two-seconds,mentally counting one, one-thousand, two ,one- thousand.then exhale through your mouth to mental count of four-second-again by one-thousands.Do this for at least 60-seconds.<br>  <br>  4.INNER DIALOGUE--Use truthful, positive dialogue to talk yourself through  the anxious time.It WILL pass. Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !

RHCUtrxnaa	Within 1/2 hour. Yes, 30 minutes. It will show once your body begins to metabolize it. When you "feel" the precocet, it's in your blood, brain, and urine. It will remain in your urine for a few days after. This time period depends on for fast your metabolism is. <br>  <br>  If you're worried about it being in your urine, I'll assume you're taking it illegally. Do not mess with the stuff!

8WYWEDOpaa	"if this other doctor says he can't do anything i have to live my live out like this in pain all the time ?"  That's BS.<br>  <br>  There are family doctors, orthopedic doctors, and then scoliosis specialists, going from general to more specialized training.  You need to get an opinion from at least one scoliosis specialist.  If you can, you might want to get more than one.<br>  <br>  Even beyond the scoliosis specialists, there are some that are the best of the best.  What city are you in?  I can recommend a couple if you'd like.<br>  <br>  Unless your back is already fused, having a spine fusion doesn't "break" your spine.  The doctor does cut through your muscles to get to your spine but he removes your discs, places "cages" which keep the space between the vertebrae, attaches hardware to hold the rods in place, attaches rods to your back, and then puts extra material along the spine (for example, bone from your hip) to help your spine to fuse.  Keep in mind that this is done only to the vertebrae that need to be fused to treat your scoliosis.  A good amount of your spine will be left alone. <br>  <br>  So, how old are you and what kind of doctor have you been seeing so far?  Have you ever had your back operated on before?|`|AA12349214	Why dont you google to see if there is a scoliosis society and then go on the sites and see if there is a forum for you to post this question and talk to others who have been in the same position?<br>  Your advice sounds woefully inadequate to me.

If you find yourself feeling really high-energy, don't want to eat or sleep, think and talk really fast .... PLEASE, get in touch with your doctor or emergency ward.

AA11088528	You just had a very intrusive operation if you have pins. It is unfortunately going to hurt for a while, probably 5 days after surgery you will fell much better.  You should just rest and try not to use your hand or arm at all until the pain has ebbed off a bit.<br>  <br>  Since it is the weekend, I don't think that you will be able to reach your doctor for a prescription, so if it were me I would take the Tylenol 3's as prescribed and try to sit with my wrist elevated above the heart. Keeping it elevated will help a lot! I wouldn't ice it unless it is in the post op instructions that it is okay to do so. Monday call the doc and have them write you another prescription but honestly anything they will write stronger than the Tylenol 3 will make you feel spaced out,so you'll have to decided if you want less pain and spacey or pain and clear headed! ;) ,sorry you are hurting, I just had surgery myself and healing is miserable,but brief!!<br>  Hang in there!!|`|zrKxEvVGaa	Wow, pain can be a pain especially when it's in the wrist. I suffered with a wrist injury for many years when I was into sport karate during seize and control applications. I had to manage my pain and take natural remedies because regular drugs can and will damage your kidneys and liver if taken for long periods. In the beginning I would take Aleve 3 times a day and that would take the edge off the pain. I didn't mess with Tylenol or other such drugs because after they wore off the pain seemed worse.<br>  <br>   I managed my pain with mediation, I know it's hard to relax when in sever pain but I had no choice I needed to relax and take my mind of the excruciating pain. I learned that there are several levels of pain and that at the highest level of pain one would pass out and never experience that level. But the other levels could be managed and it's agony lessened with hot, compresses, an occasional pain reliever, natural Chinese pain remedies, mediation, and soft, slow chiropractic movements to help realign and  lesson the inflammation which are causing the pain. <br>  <br>  I also learned that there are two types of pain besides ouch or not so ouch and they are physical and emotional pain. Both types of pain are real but the emotional pain will hurt more and will stay with you longer. Both both pains respond well when treated with natural pain relievers. The Chinese remedies can be found in China town and they look like brown colored BB”s that they use in BB guns.  These will not only relieve pain they will also heal bones, tendons muscle or whatever. They will also work on muscle spasms near the site of the injury. These work for me when opiates wouldn't on all of my past injuries .<br>  <br>  Well hope this info will help you manage your pain and remember not all natural remedies work but the ones that do are the lease advertised or known by all...|`|q9BItD25aa	Call your doctor......no one on this site can help you........Good luck.|`|APuRA6hzaa	Well-them percocets will do that. You could ice it (cast?). Make sure that you keep it elevated. I would suggest to call the doctors and ask them for something else. I'm surprised that they only gave you a few<br>  of them after a surgery like that. Unfortunately you  are in the worst position-chasing the pain. Definitely them Tylenol 3's is not going to do it.Best of luck to you-hope you feel better.|`|tKIgqrTkaa	well im afraid apart from pain relieve brought over the counter theres nothing else any one can advice you to take , you need to speak to your GP   ice packs or heat packs may help you can always try them|`|xmibEEdcaa	Ouch. I'm also surprised that they didn't give you a larger supply of percocet, or at least some vicodin, for your post-surgery.  Tylenol 3 isn't nearly as strong, although it's certainly better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Ice might help, as might meditation, if you're skilled at it.  Doing something to keep your mind off the pain, like reading a really good novel or watching an exciting movie, can sometimes help. So can things that your brain finds soothing, like aromatherapy or getting a nice massage.<br>  <br>  But if it gets really bad, then it would probably be a good idea to get more pain killers.  If you can't wait for Monday, you can get someone to take you to the ER. They will likely give you something for the pain.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, anything that really helps the pain is probably also going to space you out some. That's just the pain-relief trade-off.

V9NGGPP5aa	It seems that oestrogen helps to decide body fat distribution. Oestrogen is one of the female sex hormones made by the ovaries. It is responsible for prompting ovulation every menstrual cycle. Women of childbearing age tend to store fat in the lower body (‘pear shaped’), while men and postmenopausal women store fat around the abdomen (‘apple shaped’). Postmenopausal women on oestrogen supplements don’t accumulate fat around the abdomen. Animal studies have also shown that a lack of oestrogen leads to excessive weight gain.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

9RcwQgNpaa	Hi, it's a difficult situation altogether.  My brother used heroin for many years and my mum works for an NHS drugs team, and we live in the UK.  <br>  <br>  What we found was-  it was very hard to get help initially, and the only way to do it was via the local GP.  In order to access any NHS services (such as drugs teams or mental health services) you'll almost certainly have to be referred by a doctor.  Some doctors are sympathetic to the situation, others aren't.  But once you have a referral you may find you have to go on a waiting list.  Mental health departments are often unwilling to deal with addiction, unless there's an additional mental illness as well.  So you may only find help with a community drugs team, which may or may not have affiliations with the police.  It varies all around the country.  I know in my area, if you are in trouble with the police for drug possesion say, they are good at sorting out referrals to the drugs services, often more quickly than the doctors are!<br>  <br>  I'm sure that wherever your relative lives, there will be an NHS service of some kind for drug users and it will be accessable somehow, but getting into the system can take time and may require repeated appointments and a lot of persistence.  But it should at least be free.  At the place where my mum works (and where my brother used to attend), there is a needle exchange, counselling, occupatioinal therapy, access to doctors, nurses and social workers and complete support for anyone who can make use of it.  <br>  <br>  They prescribe methadone (if that's the right choice, there are many alternatives), and do supported detoxes.  They do accupuncture and workshops and home visits, loads of things really.<br>  <br>  But of course their success rate is limited.  They aren't there 24/7, there are staff shortages and budgets are always being cut.  Some of the staff are brilliant, some less so.  <br>  <br>  At one point my brother did a detox at home with our GP's support and help, (though this was after a long time trying to get help), he was given advice and a selection of (legal!) drugs to help him through the first few days.  It was totally effective, as effective as a 5 day private clinic detox costing ￡2000 would have been.  But I have learned that for most people trying to get off heroin the first few days are hard but not nearly as bad as you imagine, even for heavy users.  The problems set in after the initial detox is over, the body may be free of the drug but the need for it is still there.  I don't know the best way of dealing with that.  My brother had given up totally, got his life on track and was going to live abroad to change himself entirely for the better.  Sadly he overdosed, out of the blue.  I guess the lure of the drug was still there, and as he was drunk and having fun he thought why not.<br>  <br>  Just keep trying and don't give up.  You must keep pushing your doctor for a referral to get some help.  You will get there eventually.  <br>  <br>  You were wondering about the law re/ addiction.  The mental health act is there to help people who don't want treatment, but need it- but not usually if they're using drugs.  It's not great, but there's a big division between mental health and drug services.  It's awful, but if your relative doesn't allow you or someone to try and help, and refuses to seek any help or stop using, there's not many options open other than unconditional love and support (which is often the very hardest thing of all), and just sheer bloody mindedness in trying to get them to seek help...  Keep an open mind too, so many people think that a methodone programme is the only option, which just isn't true.  There are other drug treatments, many of which are safer and easier to live with.<br>  <br>  Some people find that if they get involved in the criminal justice system (I know this sounds negative, but it happens a lot with heroin), they find supportive ways of detoxing and changing their behaviour in prison or in the community with a referral to a community drugs team.<br>  <br>  I can't stress enough that things are different in every county and health authority.  What we found, you might not.  But start with your GP and if s/he doesn't want to know, keep going back and get second opinions or see another doctor.<br>  <br>  Also go to www.addaction.org.uk.  They have lots of information and they people on the phones can help a lot.<br>  I am sure something in your area will exist, and I wish you loads of luck in finding it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your family, you have my sympathy and support, it can be so difficult.  Best wishes.

The truth is that the Pounds 300 million we spend every year on vitamin supplements is almost entirely money down the drain. <br>  <br>  Even worse, many of these vitamins may actually be very bad for us - and could even kill us. <br>  <br>  There is absolutely no proof that supplements do most people any good whatsoever. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that high-dose vitamins can actually be dangerous. <br>  <br>  We are the guinea pigs of the future. <br>  <br>  And that's why I'm delighted that the Government - prompted by the European Union - plans to ban some 300 so-called health foods and supplements in July. <br>  <br>  I know that my support for the ban will not be popular. But for years we've been fed a series of myths by the health supplement industry. <br>  <br>  We're told that vitamins are a natural extension of food and therefore cannot be bad for us. <br>  <br>  That's just nonsense. When they occur naturally in food, vitamins are undoubtedly beneficial. And I see no harm in people taking very small doses of vitamin supplements. They can be useful if you're pregnant, elderly or suffer from a chronic disease such as osteoporosis. <br>  <br>  But the average vitamin C effervescent tablet contains the equivalent of four litres of orange juice. <br>  <br>  When you take a level of a nutrient that far exceeds the physiological needs of the average person, common sense says it can't really be any good for us. <br>  <br>  It used to be thought that our bodies got rid of excess vitamins with no side effects. However, proof is now coming in that - far from being harmless - taking too many vitamins can be extremely dangerous. <br>  <br>  WE KNOW that vitamins A, C and E have antioxidant properties which are helpful in protecting against cancer. So scientists in the U.S. decided to test whether vitamins can prevent cancer. <br>  <br>  Taking 2,000 smokers, they gave half of them a high dose of beta carotene supplement - the equivalent of six carrots a day. <br>  <br>  Four years later, the trial had to be abandoned because, to the scientists' horror, the supplements weren't simply making no difference: they actually seemed to cause an 18 per cent rise in lung cancer among the testers. A study in Finland found eerily similar results. <br>  <br>  It now seems that because vitamins help blood cell regeneration, the high-level supplements can boost tumours so they grow quicker and more aggressively. It's the complete opposite of the commonly held belief that vitamins are probably beneficial, and at worst harmless. <br>  <br>  The American researchers followed the group up four years after the trial had been abandoned. They expected that, despite the lung cancer figures, the extra vitamins might at least have provided protection in other areas. <br>  <br>  But their findings, published in 2004, recorded that there was absolutely no difference in the incidence of other cancers, heart disease and other problems in the two groups. Taking vitamins solidly for four years provided no health benefits whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Another recent study from America shows increased risk of heart attack in patients taking high doses of vitamin E. <br>  <br>  It has also been found that high doses of vitamin A cause the acceleration of osteoporosis, while high doses of the B group vitamins can lead to nerve tingling in the feet and legs. <br>  <br>  And those are just the symptoms we are immediately aware of. We don't even know the full reasons why these things happen. <br>  <br>  It does, however, make sense. If you take a couple of painkillers for a headache, you do no harm. But if you take 200, your body goes into liver failure and you die. <br>  <br>  In the same way, pumping our bodies full of unnecessary vitamins is potentially lethal. <br>  <br>  It's a myth that no one has ever died or suffered from taking vitamins. <br>  <br>  The truth is that, as there is still so little evidence, it's impossible to know the full effects. It's still uncharted territory. <br>  <br>  A diet rich in vitamin E can help combat the early onset of Alzheimer's. But patients who were given high doses of the vitamin showed no improvement whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Perhaps when the vitamin is taken in supplement form, it is not absorbed in the same way and actually ends up blocking the absorption of the natural vitamin - thus having a detrimental effect. <br>  <br>  All problems with pharmaceutical drugs and alternative medicines have to be reported. For example, after a body of evidence was collected, the herbal remedy St John's Wort now carries the warning that it reduces the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive. <br>  <br>  However, there is no mechanism in Britain to report problems with vitamin supplements. We just have anecdotal evidence. <br>  <br>  I recently treated a woman who fell dangerously ill after taking magnesium tablets. She suffered from ME and they had been prescribed by her alternative therapist to help boost her energy. <br>  <br>  If she'd taken just one a day, they would probably have done no harm. <br>  <br>  She took eight a day for two years, as recommend|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, If it's a one off accident then, don't worry.

UJtUpWO0aa	Ooooooooo ?  That's a trough one.  The main times that I experienced that rush you're referring to was when I was running/jogging everyday at about 3 to 7 miles per day and I had about 6% body fat.  That was quite a while ago, so I don't remember exactly when that high kicks in.  Depending on how much weight you need to lose, I pretty much stayed at or near my ideal body weight most of my life.  Of course I'm almost 60 and I still workout and do cardio on a regular basis.  Best of luck, but never give up!

urWEFRciaa	Hello<br>  You need to place a warm compress on the boil to help it come to a head and drain faster. To do this soak a cotton compress in warm water - you can add a little salt or a few drops of tea tree oil to help kill the infection. Place the compress on the boil and leave for twenty minutes. Repeat this four times a day. This should help ease the pain and encourage healing. Also make sure you drink at least 6 glasses of water daily to help flush out the toxins.|`|A9MDoFooaa	ouch!<br>  you could go into A&E and the doctor there will prescribe you some anti-biotics - if it is bad enough.<br>  if its not too bad - leave it well alone - at the moment it is sterile - if you pop it or try and squeeze it you may introduce bacteria and then it'll be really sore - if you have any lavender essential oil (if not pop to boots and buy a small bottle) drop two drops straight onto the spot and leave to work its magic ;-) - as long as you are not allergic to lavender (unlikely but possible) in which case use tea tree instead. while you are in boots get some rosemary essential oil as well - pop a drop or two onto a tissue and keep with you in your exam - sniff when you need to clear your head and concentrate :-)<br>  <br>  hth a bit

mlAwNRWhaa	4 Simple Steps to Lose Man Boobs<br>  <br>  Step 1. Reduce Calories: The best way to burn fat is to cut the calories. But be sure not to get out of <br>  control, like starving yourself. Just cut back and read food labels before purchase.<br>  <br>  Step 2. Less Sugar: Sugar is burned for energy, sugar found in junk food and sodas burns rather <br>  quickly, where vegetables and fruit sugars burn slowly. However, if you are not using energy to burn <br>  these sugars over time these sugars will turn into body fat.<br>  <br>  Step 3. Exercise: Walking, running, swimming, jogging, attending a gym, are all great ideas. The <br>  reason is if you are staying active you can almost eat whatever you want! Why? Because your body <br>  is burning everything you take in. Staying active is a key to getting rid of man boobs.<br>  <br>  Step 4. Cosmetic Surgery: This can be expensive and very painful however; the results are usually <br>  100 percent effective. Before taking this step into consideration I suggest trying to do it through a <br>  good diet and exercise. I say this because after your surgery you will still have the same eating <br>  habits and probably be back where you started before you know. That's why I suggest this step as a <br>  last resort. Also be sure to seek a doctor's advice before taking this step.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are the only person who can do this; no one can do it for you. But before you know it <br>  those annoying man boobs will be gone.|`|72iZuDjeaa	diet and exercise will help to reduce the mass but you will never rid yourself of the tissue short of cosmetic surgery to remove it... sorry ;-(<br>  <br>  you can always be happy and joke it off though ;-)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs1DsNBvEoc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs1DsNBvE...</a>|`|NPMKqJlMaa	BENCH PRESS!<br>  <br>  BOTH INCLINE AND DECLINE|`|9afcce9c6932e5814db58e7db372397aaa	Press ups are good.

AA11088528	You may not find this possible but it is most likely your sciatic nerve.<br>  I had this same problem and when I found that it was the sciatic nerve I was dumbfounded because I had no idea how the sciatic nerve worked.<br>  I could have sworn the problem originated in my hip. In fact the problem was in my lower lumbar.<br>  What happens is...you more than likely have a ruptured or bulging disc<br>  in your lower lumbar region mine was between L4/L5. The disc is enlarged and is pushing into the sciatic nerve causing it to inflame and if left untreated will cause permanent nerve damage.<br>  The Sciatic nerve runs from the lower back at the spine. It runs towards both hips,down the hip/buttock area, along the outside or back of the thigh past the knee across the shin and into the big toe.<br>  <br>  If you will google ruptured disc or sciatic nerve you will see that this is the most likely answer to your problem. It can be the most painful thing you have ever experienced if untreated and it is only detected with a MRI. X Rays will not show this as it is soft tissue damage. If you are lucky (I know you don't feel lucky;( ! ) You will only have a bulging disc and you can apply alternate ice and heat to the lower back area in intervals of 15 min each every 2 hours. Also Aleve and Tylenol together will help with the pain. Aleve to relieve the swelling and the acetaminaphin in the Tylenol to relieve the pain. You may require more than a day or two bed rest depending on how bad your damage is,but believe me you want to let it heal. Long term Sciatic pain is life changing and extremely limiting. I am now disabled from this very same type injury.<br>  <br>  So take care of it and make sure that if you see a doctor that you request MRI, XRays are a waste of money in this case.|`|fF1WbPltaa	Sounds like an inflamed sciatic nerve. Probably the trouble is in your lumbar spine.|`|NSARVXkMaa	Sounds like you have sciatica.  What happens is the muscles of your core (your hips, thighs, back and most importantly your abs) get knotted and in spasm.  You may have done something to irritate any of those muscles or to hurt your spine, like lift something heavy.  If this is the case your spine sounds like it is compressed and because of that it's irritating those nerves around the compression and causing you all kinds of pains.  When these muscles are irritated they pull the lower back and pelvis out of alignment and that causes painful sciatica and other problems.  I hurt my back before and a friend turned me onto inversion therapy or hanging upside down.  After just one try I could feel the muscles in my abs start to stretch out as the spasms broke up and the muscles relaxed.  As your abs loosen they will release their grip on your hip muscles and thighs.  As those muscles all loosen they will release their grip on your lower back muscles. As they relax and loosen they will release their grip on your lower spine and pelvis.  Once all the muscles are relaxed your lower back and pelvis will be free to go back into alignment naturally and this is what will stop your pain and sciatica.  Stretching the muscles is the most important thing!  Hope this helps.

Her father would not tell her what happened.  Then the little girl got older and older.  She was a grownup now and had a husband.  Her dad was still alive as well.  The little girl and her husband had a girl of their own as well.  Since the little girl knew her mother had passed down the ribbon from her she decided to do the same.  The next night she got a call from her father, and her father said "Don't ever give away that green ribbon. Anyone's whos neck touches it falls off 24 hours after its off.

I'm sure you all have heard of how children always believe that there's a monster hiding under the bed at nite. Well, she says that one nite she was laying in bed when out of now where, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!! There was a banging sound coming from under her bed. 'Til this day, she swears to me that this is totally true. She says "i wasn't dreaming, I just know i wasn't dreaming!" "I had just layed down on my bed". Then she says that the BOOM sounds got louder and louder and LOUDER!...until.........all of a sudden..................................... loudest BOOM yet!! And this time, the horrifying sound also made her bed jump about 2 feet from her floor. I called her a lier when she said this part. But she insists til this day that it is true. I asked her mother about that nite to see if she had heard anything. She told me this "well, I didn't know exactly what was going on, but I do remember waking up startled by a loud sound. I didn't know where it came from though. So I got up and checked on my daughter and she was in the corner of her room shaking and crying uncontrolably" She also told me that when her daughter told her what happened, she looked under, and all around her bed to see if she could find anything, but she saw no one. She says that the only thing she DID see were marks on the hard wood floor of the bedroom. Right under the legs of the bed.

When I was young (12) I learned from other school friends how to do it . You are even a bit late in starting but you may just be one of those guys where puberty is a bit late starting . It will not affect your health or ability to father children , indeed it helps release stress / tension and helps you understand how your body works . If you don't masturbate  regularly , and there are the odd guy or two who might not , then it increases chances of nocturnal emission (wet dream) and these cause a sticky mess in boxers and bed linen .

iBitNRZuaa	Lymph nodes are a part of your lymph system.  The lymph system is an integral part of your immune system.  Your immune system functions to fight off disease.  You can think of your lymph system as a series of tubes through out your body and the ends of those types as being the lymph nodes. <br>  <br>  Often when a body is fighting off infection, there is swelling in the lymph system and in particularly of the nodes.  I am not particularly aware of issues with ice water, cold beverages, or chocolate on the immune and/or lymph system.  However, there is some correlation of reduced immune functions and sugar; most eating chocolate contains a reasonable amount of sugar.  There is an indication that cold items, particularly beverages, make the "body work harder" as the must be warmed up in the body before being fully utilized.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have some type of an infection going on, your immune system and lymph systems are fighting it, and you are not quite done with it.  In part, fever and chills are your body's way of changing its internal tempature so that what ever is bugging you has a harder time of living and propogating; many bugs are very temperature dependent.  It sounds like your body did a good job of fighting off the infection two weeks ago to the point that you were no longer feeling too many symptoms.  But, not quite so well as to completely get rid of it.  It sounds like your infection has started to re-imerge enough to give you noticable symptoms.<br>  <br>  Plenty of fluids, plenty of rest, a balanced diet of nutritious foods, and keeping your body out of the elements are all great ways to enhance your body's general functioning and immune system.  Fluids are critical.  You can think of them as cars on the highways and byways of your immune system.  They form the mechanisms to transport the disease fighters into and through your body as well as the method of transport to remove diseased cells and compounds out of your body.  Plenty of sleep and rest are very important as "fighting a bug" is exactly what is going on inside your body; there is a little mini war between the bug and your immune system going on.  This requires a resonable amount of effort and work, even if you're not tired the inside of your body is getting a full work-out.  It can do a quicker, faster, and better job if you give it enough rest.  A balanced diet of nutritious food gives your body the compounds it needs for optimal function; since it's fighting a mini war against a bug, the better its fuel, the better its fight.  Keeping out of the elements (too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter) allows your body to concentrate its functions in fighting your bug rather than having to regulate your body temperature.  -  Do try to moderate your sugar intake as there is a reasonable amount of evidence that it impares (negatively impacts) your immune system.<br>  <br>  How long it will take for your lymph node swelling to go down depends upon how long it takes your body to fight off its infection and/or bug.  Of course, when you're fighting off a current bug, your immune system is running thin which makes you all the more susceptable to the next bug that crosses your path.  Right now, you could be fighting a resurgence of the bug from two weeks ago or, a whole new bug.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like your mom pretty much knows and understands things.  In addition to making sure you're getting plenty of fluids and rest, you might want to talk about the whole thing a little more with your mother.  Be sure to ask the how and why questions; this is how we increase our own, personal, data bank of information and wiseness.  You might also want to discuss with her how and/or what could be causing/have caused the initial infection in the first place.  And, you might want to discuss with her when/if a trip to the doctor is called for if you are able.|`|4tI5tE4Oaa	well last year my girlfreind had the same problem. i woudl go to the doctor and get some antibiotics. my grilfreind got some, and she started feeling better but the swelling was still there for about a week. hhope i helped|`|sR4HjV9Paa	No, they ain't feelin' no pain, thank ya very much.

JpihhFhqaa	Well when a person contracts HIV, the "flu symptoms" start about 2-4 weeks after the encounter. The flu takes at least 7 days for your body to be completely cured of it. The flu can be caused by bacteria, or virus, so sometimes antibiotic won't work. It's most likely not HIV, especially since you used condoms. Since your last encounter was 2 months ago with that girl, wait about another 3 months, & get tested because it takes 4-6 months for accurate results.|`|fk9AvB25aa	There are 2 stds that I know of that make you have flu like symptoms, herpes and HIV. But both of these stds can take months or weeks to show symptoms. Stds like these can take months or years to develop symptoms because they can lie dormant for long periods of time, even after you contracted them.<br>  But then again it could be just the flu or a bad cold. If your worried then get tested for stds, include herpes and HIV, some std tests don't cover them.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	If you used a condom, and it did not break, your risk of HIV infection is almost zero.  Your symptoms are probably just flu.<br>  Symptoms:  Most people who have HIV have no symptoms for several years, although some have flu symptoms.  The problem is that it is impossible to tell the difference between flu symptoms caused by HIV infection and flu symptoms caused by actual flu.  <br>  Testing:  Because of lack of symptoms, the only way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested.  More than 98% of people who have HIV would test positive within 3 months.  In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.  It would not take more than 6 months for someone to test positive, even though it could take years for symptoms to show up.<br>  <br>  Your risk of infection from these experiences is extremely low, but you may want to consider getting tested for peace of mind.  You can check the website hivtest.org to find free testing sites in your area.  Just enter your ZIP code.|`|wjGj6uU3aa	first of all it takes 8 months for HIV to get into your system and if you used a condom which is a barrier method then i doubt there is a chance that you caught any thing. its probably just the flu it takes 2 weeks to clear up. dont worry youl be fine. if you are that worries speak to your GP|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Many different infection have similar symptoms.  And you can't tell them apart by looking at symptoms alone.  The only way you can know if you have an HIV infection or not is to do a blood test for it at a medical laboratory.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Go get tested, we dont know.

2OO9U8o9aa	You are not that far away from ejaculating what will become the normal seminal fluid . When I first started masturbating (around 12) my early orgasms were dry with no fluid at all . next stage the sticky fluid you describe began to seep out following orgasm . About 3 or 4 months after that I started to ejaculate small quantities of milky coloured semen . The clear sticky fluid is just the early attempts of your body at production of semen . All guys run to differing timetables in puberty , when I was still having dry ejaculation some of my mates had already reached full ejaculation and strength in the flow|`|AA11785060	Need to read up on male puberty. You can probably ejaculate now, the clear stuff is just pre-ejaculatory fluid and if you produce that you should be able to produce semen- which is not necessarily white by the way.  The pre-ejaculatory fluid is produced from the same glands that produce the seminal fluid so you should be ready, just not yet sexually turned on enough to go over the edge to a full climax.  Go slow and easy dude, take your time, it will happen. You'll know when it does, that is for sure.|`|PAG1hgb6aa	thats depends on ur age dear..<br>  i guess if ur at the age of 13+<br>  <br>  u are still under the period of puberty..<br>  <br>  many things are about to happen..<br>  <br>  u dont need to rush things..

KOYC3XkJaa	It sounds to me like you're having an allergic reaction to whatever bit you. Try taking some benedryl and monitor your symptoms. If they get worse, you should go to the doctor. I understand that money is an issue, but since you're a student-- try your school/campus nurse or health center first. If they can treat it, you're all set. If they can't, you'll at least be sure that you're not wasting the money on something that would've cleared up on its own.

Losing too much weight at one time is horrible.

Do it in steps.  The first week tell yourself - to just workout everyday for twenty minutes. Then the second week add ten more minutes.  When you have defeated the exercise hurdle - concentrate on the food.<br>  <br>  Give yourself one week to get off sugar -- processed foods. Then the next week, start adding veggies to your diet.  <br>  <br>  To get rid of water weight, stay away from salty foods.  Drink at least two liters of water a day.

KAwYumFfaa	There is no norm with the time of healing with muscles. Best thing you should do it put on some liniment on that sprained calf muscle of your so to increase the blood flow. Also, try to move the muscles a lil bit but not forcing it to. That could help out circulate the lactic acid that has build up on the calf.
OnDIrxNEaa	First they usually weigh you & take your blood pressure.  Sometimes they "finger stick" you to test for anemia, and make you give a urine sample to test for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Then you go into the room and put on the paper gown (well, at my dr.'s I just take off my pants & underwear and cover my lower half with a sheet).  They usually perform the breast exam first to check for lumps or abnormalities.<br>  <br>  After that they perform the pelvic exam, you will be asked to lay back and scoot your butt down to the edge of the table, and put your feet into the stirrups.  The dr. will insert the speculum to open your vagina and see your cervix, and then she will insert a long Q-tip type thing (this is the Pap smear).  It doesn't hurt as much as you think, it just feels like pressure, not pain. If you are nervous and/or a virgin, ask if they can use the smallest speculum possible.  I still use the small one and I've been going to the gyno for almost 10 years.  <br>  <br>  At that point she takes the speculum out and will put a gloved, lubricated finger inside your vagina while pressing on your stomach with the other hand, to feel your ovaries.  Then you are pretty much ready to get dressed and leave!!|`|NifPNzqDaa	Uhh....

Here's what I'd say: <br>  If you're going to kill yourself then go ahead... You know why? Because the only thing stopping anyone in the world today from killing themselves isnt the fear of death...actually death is something great because the only people who suffer are the ones who are still alive. but people fear death because the suicidal ones who resort to it only do it because they think it'll put a stop to everything. But look, when you die,-death is like an experiment. Just, when you die, you don't get to come back and see how the experiment works. <br>  Dude, the ones you love and hate will laugh or cry for a short period of time...then the world will forget alll about you. So, please don't just DIE> <br>  If you're going to kill yourself..at least take some of those jerks who are mean to you with you...do the world a favor. At least walk up to that guy to have a crush on, look him in the eye and tell him you love him. Or walk up to that teacher and do the worst thing you could ever do to him. <br>  If you're going to die...please do it happy.|`|DcnY79iIaa	First let me say that I have had these thoughts myself.  I currently have no real friends.  I have dealt with abuse from both students and teachers.  I have attempted suicide a few times.  However, it is not the answer.  People who treat you unfairly and call you names are really just miserable inside (I have seen this).  You have a purpose in this life that you may not know yet.  You have skills and abilities that make you great as a human being.  I would feel terrible if you went through with your thoughts.  Please talk to somebody you know you can trust<br>  (friend, guidance councilor, church).  Hang in there.
