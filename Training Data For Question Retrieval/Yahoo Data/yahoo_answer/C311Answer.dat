They stole my boyfriend too!"<br>  <br>  A cowboy accidently walks into a gay bar & tells the bartender "I'm so thirsty I could lick the sweat off a bulls balls!"  The man next to him immediately stands up & says "Moooooooooo!"<br>  <br>  How do gay guys do a drive-by?<br>  They throw skittles out the window and yell "Taste the rainbow, beeahtch!"<br>  <br>  A gay couple taking an evening stroll through the park decided to take off their clothes & make love on the ground behind a bush.  After a few minutes, the man behind say's " I wish I had some light, I cant see a thing". The man on his belly say's " So do I, ever since we started, you've been licking the grass!"<br>  <br>  What does one fag say to another fag going on vacation?<br>  Can I help you pack your ****? <br>  <br>  What's the most common pickup line in a gay bar?<br>  May I push your stool in?<br>  <br>  What does AIDS stand for?<br>  Anally Injected Death Sentence.<br>  <br>  A lesbian goes into a brothel and asks for the prettiest, youngest girl availible.

VD4NQMLLaa	The name "Nickelodeon" was coined by Harry Davis and John P. Harris, who opened their small, storefront theatre with that name on Smithfield Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in June 1905. Though theirs was not the first theatre in the world to specialize in presenting movies, Davis and Harris found such great success with their operation that their concept of a five cent theatre running movies continuously was soon imitated by hundreds of ambitious entrepreneurs, as was the name of the theatre itself.|`|dpSTgytfaa	actually if im right he's refering to a mini hand roled movie machine.<br>  <br>  kind of looks like a arcade game machine where you can control the speed of the movie and only cost a few cents.|`|84db822e80c8ab6223d50689fd25b00aaa	A movie theater.

AA10214276	Like, for the first time? I don't remember.. Today at the mall I saw a chick that looked kinda hot from a distance, but when I got closer she was just normal-looking. Oh, I remember! When I went to Disney World for New Year's with my family, we were in Hollywood Studios and I saw this super cute chick.. She was there with a bunch of friends, and she had the perfect body, and I just couldn't stop looking at her. She looked like she was 20 something. She was wearing a red shirt and black three-quarter jeans, and the next day we went to Magic Kingdom, and I saw her again! And she was wearing the same clothes.. Ah, she was so cute.|`|xLllDu18aa	friday.........school|`|ZJkwz1B5aa	There's like this Gem in the jewelry store at the mall!!!!!!!!!!!!!

76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	yeah, I was really hoping that Adam would pick that song. It just seems more him,you know? Plus, I think he actually has the vocals to pull it off. He could actually nail the scream, so that would've been really nice to hear. I did love Adam's "Whole Lotta Love",though.<br>  <br>  Anyway,vocally,I actually liked Danny's performance of "Dream On". It's more that I just see him as more of a Gospel/Soul/Blues type singer than a Rock Star. I do think Aerosmith was a good choice for him,though, just maybe not that song. I think he would've done better with one of their Bluesier songs, like maybe "Cryin'" or "Crazy",as Kara mentioned, or maybe my personal fave, "Amazing". I think that would've been the perfect song for him,vocally and lyrically. I liked "Dream On",though. But I would've liked it better if Adam sang it...|`|Vd3gI8M0aa	Danny picked he wrong song.. he would have been much better suited with say eddie moneys 'baby hold onto me' or a joe cocker song.  He could have even done janis joplin 'piece of my heart'.<br>   Have to see how it plays out for him.<br>  <br>  As for adam.. he could have hit the note but the lead up to it might have been a boring perrformance compared to what he did.  He was able to showcase the whole way through.|`|UcllCMTjaa	adam could have song any song and it would have been awesome! i would love to hear adam sing that song. i dont think danny did a good job at all. it was bad.|`|0iiKq3sjaa	That would have been way too easy for him.|`|3qckOFWIaa	adam can sing anything and make it sound great|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Danny did pretty good I thought, but it is a song that is better suited for Adam.|`|AA11517536	Wow, you're right.  I think Dream On would've been a better fit for Adam than a "whole lotta love" even.<br>  <br>  I just don't think Rock is the appropriate genre for Danny.  He does better when he's singing r&b or jazz.

No one can prove Joe cheated on Taylor, and Nick found out about his diabetes in 2005.  tha's longer then 2 years sweety.  and who gives a crap if Kevin likes publicity.  a MILLION celebs do.  And you hate them based on...the way they dress. Honey, that ain't a good reason to go a around hating people.  I'm sure you don't dress too pretty yourself.  So why don't you stop wasting your life asking questions about how much you hate someone, and go on to real things and start telling people who u DON'T HATE.  wow.  that sounds like a plan|`|948aqx2kaa	U go girl!

Taylor could have been lying. I mean I dont hate her but I dislike her because she was obviously just looking for attention. No matter how hurt you are you do not tell the world all that. its not anyones damn business! does she not look like someone who craves attention? she has this rat face. you can obviously tell shes not a very nice person. Ive been hurt before really bad but I told noone my business (except for very few friends and my therapist when I was really hurt) because guess what it was between me and my guy friend.<br>  stop acting like you know him and know that hes a jerk when you dont even pay attention to him.<br>  he even got depressed about all this bashing for a long time. you could see it in his face. he made a mistake are you perfect? no I didnt think so. neither is he. hes allowed to make a mistake. its part of being human. <br>  <br>  -is it Nick's fault that people are talking so much about it? no he may speak up about it sometimes but thats for diabetes awareness and the song was for to get his feelings out. he never asked people to talk about it like this.<br>  <br>  -Kevin does not like publicity. he did it for the fans. he took a picture himself because he was ready to share his gf with the fans since everyone wanted to know. he was tired of hiding it.

On Sunday Feb 8 at 25 hours Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F picked brown,s cellular phone and picked up a three-page text message from a woman Brown had had a previous relationship with.<br>  <br>  "A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled a vehicle over in an unknown street. Reach over Robyn F with his right hand and open the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehcile causing an approx 1 inch raised circular contusion.<br>  <br>  "Robyn F turned to face Brown and punched her in the left eye with right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F Osmouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. Brown looked at Robyn F and stated "I am going to beat the sât out of you when we get home! You wait and see!?<br>  <br>  "Robyn F picked her cellular phone and called her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her vm greeting was playing Robyn F pretended to talk to her and stated "I am on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there? (this statement was made while greeting was playing and was not captured) after Robyn f faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I really am going to kill you.'<br>  <br>  "Brown resumed punching Robyn F and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist placing her elbows and face near her lap and in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F on her left arm and hands, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approx 2 inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn f attempted to send another text message to other personal assistant Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window to an unknown street. Brown continued driving and Robyn F observed his cellular phone in his lap. She picked up the cellular phone with her left hand, and before she could make a call, he placed her in a head lock with right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.<br>  <br>  "Brown held Robyn F close to him and bit her on her left hear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [address] and Robyn F turned off the car removed the key from inignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breath. She began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began to attempting to gauge his eyes in attempt to flee herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and released her. While brown continued to punch her she turned around a place her back to against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest and placed her feet against Brown,s body and began pushing him away.<br>  <br>  "Brown continued to punch her on legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F began screaming for help. And Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighbor heard Robyn F,s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F was issued a domestic violence protective order (EPO). Affiant conducted an interview with Melissa Ford who advised on Feb. 8 2009 at 2500 hours she received a phone call from Robin F from an unknown telephone number later identified as the telephone number of Officer Chavez. Robin F had advised Ford that she had been assaulted by Brown. At approx at 1 am Brown called Ford as nothing happened. Ford advised Brown that she had already talked to Robin F and was aware of what happened. Ford had advised brown that the neighbors had called police and that they were with Robyn F. Brown had asked Ford if robin F had provided police with his name. And ford advised him that she had. Brown hung up the telephone and did not call back.<br>  <br>  "On Feb. 8, Brown turned himself in and was given a copy of the EPO and advised to not contact Robyn.<br>  <br>  "On Feb. 17 Ford advised the affiant that she had received text messages from â¦ a number that Ford recognized as belonging to Brown. In the text message Brown apologized for what he had done to Robin F. and advised Ford he was going to get help."|`|dhr7nnxoaa	None.Black and white people are no different and this queston was somewhat racist.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	uhhh, none.

PpQWhQZcaa	Me me me!!!<br>  <br>  I can't believed they jumped her either, but I read on oxygen<br>  that Tiffany was trying to take the shoe from Amber M, and thats when<br>  Amber slapped her. Pretty sad that Boston and Ailea waited until Tiffany and Amber M. started fighting to start pulling her hair and hitting her.<br>  <br>  Aliea is fake, and a sissy. If Boston and Tiffany weren't pulling Amber M's hair she wouldn't have done anything at all. And if the "Fake 5" weren't all together Ailea really wouldn't have said anything. Do you notice how the only time Ailea wants to "really fight" is when they're holding her back? ugh.<br>  <br>  And Boston, she turned fake all the way. I don't like her. Sarah and Ashley are whores and Tiff, Ailea, and Boston need to go to jail.<br>  Thats just wrong how they all jumped her, especially when she was drunk. And wth Amber B? Amber was yelling "amber! help me!"<br>  and she just stood there because she was too scared to get jumped<br>  too.<br>  <br>  Can't wait to see what happens!!!!<br>  <br>  whoo hoo!

PS0oSoXFaa	Definitely. Practicing at that rate will probably put you on the level of concert pianist. (I had a friend who went from total beginner to concert pianist in six years, and he was practicing four hours a day. It comes out roughly the same as what you're talking about)<br>  <br>  But I agree with court violinist. It's the *quality* of the practicing that counts, and also the quality of the teaching. You don't have to start off with a phenomenal- and expensive!- teacher; but always get someone decent (not your little old lady from church or local teenaged teacher), and make sure you "graduate" often enough. Expect to be paying big bucks by the end, esp. if you live in a city. If you have any special skills yourself, good enough to teach or tutor, you might want to do that to offset the cost. That's what I did with my dance classes- I used my piano teaching money to pay for it<br>  <br>  Also don't forget that you can have two teachers at once (for example having a lesson with each every two weeks, many of them won't mind this). Or you could do "visiting lessons" with expensive teachers<br>  <br>  As much as possible, take breaks in between practice sessions. When I was studying music in college I was doing 3-4 hours a day by taking 20 to 30 min practice sessions all the time, in between classes and sports practice and lunch, whenever I could. And when you practice pieces that still aren't solid, you need to drill the most difficult sections repeatedly; don't just play through. "Playing through" is called performance practice, and you only do that when you're in the final stage of a piece. Then you play the whole piece five or six times in a row, and play through any mistakes you make.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tuATxHsVaa	A bit on paying gigs - some of them will pay you for pieces that you already know how to play. Others will not, and will expect you to learn new music. Expect this a lot of the time.<br>  <br>  It is crucial that you learn how to practice slowly, and you must build a practicing process so that you can learn a piece of music in a relatively short time span (with professional results). <br>  <br>  *<br>  <br>  Yes and no. If you want to play Mozart and Beethoven, etc., then you are going to need a teacher. You can practice 2 hours every day and work backward. However, even working backward, we do work forward. What a paradox? Still, you must practice in the right way (so as not to ingrain bad playing into your habits).<br>  <br>  Little things make all the difference. I had a student that was a phenomenal violinist, but held his bow in a slightly incorrect manner. After much practice "the right" way, it became second nature to him (and his bowing got a lot better). You don't want to fall into those traps, though.<br>  <br>  There's a very nice lady on YouTube. She also runs a harpsichord society. She loves to play, practices all the time, etc. Her technique is atrocious and she can't get through anything without making a thousands mistakes. I take it that she doesn't practice pieces slowly or attend lessons anymore.<br>  <br>  Here, go ahead and look for yourself:<br>  <br>  [Link removed. Best not to disparage on people publicly - you can always email me]<br>  <br>  Go ahead and play that first video that loads up in front of you. In fact, play just about any video. Listen to her cadenza on the Brandenburg no.5... it's hard to listen to. She's very musical but the mistakes are many, many, many. I'm pretty sure she is doing this for a living...<br>  <br>  My point here is to show you that 2 hours of practice is only good when it's good practice. <br>  <br>  Remember to take proper breaks (5-10 minutes every 30 minutes or so), or you will end up injuring yourself. If you sit down and work on insanely hard pieces, nonstop, for 2 hours every day, then after 5 years your hands might be shot. You might as well go outside and bang them on concrete for several hours a day =).<br>  <br>  If you have a teacher, then things are going to probably go a lot more smoothly for you. The recitals are important, too. There's a big difference between practicing and performance. There's such a thing as the "closet pianist." Without performing regularly, you might find that you can't play very well in front of other people. Performance is different from practice, after all.<br>  <br>  Just learn all of the stuff that your teacher tells you to learn. You might find that you are proficient in piano playing after 6 years (if you pay enough attention). Everyone is different. <br>  <br>  It is also important to know the right people. Playing well is only the beginning. You have to get out there in the world and meet people to play with. However, if you play well enough - then I'm sure you'll find your way to more than a few gigs. Everyone needs an accompanist at some point - even other piano players. Be prepared to do a lot of that for money.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	If you're not at a medium or high level of playing already, it's not likely that you'd have the patience and the perseverance to practice every single day for 10 years. However, that would create the skills and repertoire of a highly advanced pianist. Better get a good teacher. If you have the basic piano skills, learning pieces for gigs should not be that difficult.|`|InAICv25aa	If you want to make your living off gigs, you need the connections also, knowing the right people will land you jobs, not knowing anyone won't. Playing well isn't enough.|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	that much practice would put you on the level of any great pianist there is.

I mean she's definitely a great girl, but if he loved Molly more, I wish he had just picked her first without causing drama.

One of my friends referred it to me, and now I found it really a good palace to enjoy anime.<br>  Just enjoy yourself and have fun!
LrKCLZF7aa	Since I don't deal with houses or signs I won't answer that part of the question. But as for the aspects here we go.<br>  <br>  Sun opposite Uranus is actually a fame line. The Mercury seems to indicate acting since Mercury rules expressions. Seems that this is someone who also changes their mind a lot.

gJhwH335aa	"GREAT VISIONARY!!! AWESOME~*** MOVIE!!! SEXY NITE OWL & DR.MAnHaTTaN!!! LOL! LOVED IT!!!"<br>  <br>  Aww.... and I thought Y!A will be fiiled Rorsharach fan boys / girls XD<br>  <br>  Chyeahh... I watched the movie. I also think they did a good job with the adaptation even though they can't fit all stuff into one movie. I think the changes they made by not having the Giant Squid and pointing the blame to Dr Manhattan is necessary and fit the storyline very well (even though I have a thing for big monster in big screen) ^__^<br>  <br>  I like what they did with Dr Manhattan though. I mean, I'm glad they didn't make his voice sounds robotic or godlike to fit his character and appearance. The real actor voice sounded monotonous and humble which I think fits the character very well. Rorsharch voice is awesome too. I love all the scene that involved this two character. I mean, I always get a goosebumps whenever they showed Dr Manhattan godlike scene, the way he moved in slow mo... well aside from the blue pen-ish swinging around of course >.>" *awkward silence*<br>  <br>  The movie is really long though. I mean, it can be a turned off to those that didn't read the comics because they will be bored halfway through the movie. I saw some people leaving the theatre and fell asleep during the narrative part XD<br>  <br>  Other than that, chyeahh... the movie is still a good movie. Many comics fan may think the movie sucks but I think its pretty enjoyable experience to see all the characters and the scene being brought out to live by a real actor. I give the movie 8 out of 10. Watchmen movie tend to be a hit or missed movie experience. Either the audience love and enjoy the movie, or completely avoiding and hate it.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Aww...

PGeAFKYZaa	The data provided from Astro point of view indicates Karak lagnam, Simha Rashi, Vimsotari Mahadasha of Kuja/Mangal and pratiantar of Surya till March 15 and then Chandarmaa till October of of 2009. Even though Surya is exalted in tenth house the lord of 10th house is in debilitation in lagnaa along with Rahu and both Surya and Kuja are in friendly home but because of the limitations of the situations above you have not been able to get the proportionate benefit of your hard work. Don't be disappointed. As a rule of thumb avoid bad company, bad habits which will always help you. Besides fast on Tuesdays and Thursday and wear a copper ring in right hand ring finger on Tuesday morning and Silver Kadaa on Monday or Friday after washing with milk and reciting prayers with true heart for God's Grace. More graceful you are going to be to God's Creation more Grace you are going to get.<br>  <br>  Daily, prayers and meditation early in the morning after a shower and prayers at bed time, visiting Gurudwara daily and doing saiwaa, especially of shoes and simran, fasting on Thursday, daily Surya namuskaram, prefer vegetarian life style, absolutely no smoke, drugs and alcohol. Please note to be very kind and of real service to your parents, wife and women in general, if done with true heart should bring fruitful results in all walks of life. These thoughts are given in good faith, please use your own discretion.|`|YzCTq13caa	no|`|FE96lTPLaa	Cancer ascendant with Moon and Rahu; 10th is occupied by 2nd lord Sun in exaltation. 9th, the house of destiny is occupied by its lord Jupiter in own sign and Venus in exaltation.

You are likely to the offer in May-June this year.|`|j1jysy6baa	you have a brilliant vedic chart and Sun is exalted in 10th house of career giving you a brilliant career preferably in government service <br>  Unfortunately you are in the middle of Sade Saathi as Moon is in Leo(Simha Rasi) so you will have to take it easy for more two and a half years when Sadi Saathi will end.So please don't be disheartened if you don't get one of these promotions.<br>  Jupiter lord of 9th house of fortune is in own house giving you good fortune in life.<br>  Rahu  and Ketu in Kendra position (Rahu in lagna and Ketu in 7th) makes you rise very high in life.<br>  Saturn lord of 7th in 7th will give you the good fame in life.|`|ef4b0b9eb5f80f99b4a112e5e254c3d2aa	yes you will,keep the good work on ,never loose hope,good things come to those who wait and deserve best of luck

G9rwmQH6aa	It can be done, and fairly easily, depending on how your guitar is routed.<br>  Under the pickguard there are holes for the pickups to fit in. Depending on when your guitar was made, it may have what's known as a 'bathtub' route or individual routes for each pickup.<br>  Most will have a larger route near the bridge for a humbucking pickup.<br>   If so, you'll need a new pickguard and of course a pickup.<br>  You can transfer the rest of the electronics to the new one, solder the new pickup in place of the old, and away yougo. You'll just need to make sure the new pickguard has the same hole patterns as the old.<br>  A friend of mine fitted quick-clip connectors to the leads to the output jack, and had a half-dozen loaded pickguards with various configurations ready to go. he could switch them out in less than 5 minutes.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	It's a can do. You might want to add a couple of extra switches to serial/parallel and phase change the humbucker. (assume your looking at a Seymour Duncan or similar).|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	It can and has been done.  I would test the pickup on a pawnshop special before commencing major surgery on a valued ax.<br>  Precut pickguards are available but the body cavity will need to be routed out to fit the larger pickup.

9176ced168f36be5278735505c86c8f1aa	What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Capricorn relationship? They each bring their own particular qualities to the relationship. Once they allow one another to be themselves -- rather than measuring one another against impossible standards -- they can blend well to make a whole. Theirs is a challenging relationship, but if they can learn from each other it's definitely worth it!

56de0d13b60e4e7c79c8f66714bec0b5aa	I miss her. (though I didn't personally know her)<br>  Here's something from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  On August 25, 2001, at 6:45 pm (EST), just after finishing filming of the music video to "Rock the Boat", Aaliyah and various members of her record company boarded a twin engine Cessna 402B (N8097W) at Marsh Harbour, Abaco Island, Bahamas to travel to Opa-locka Airport near Miami, Florida. The crew had a flight scheduled the next day, but since the video wrapped early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the US. Aaliyah's entourage was in a rush to get back to New York so they demanded that their heavy equipment from the shoot be on the plane rather than leave it behind which resulted in the aircraft being well beyond the standard weight and balance tolerance provided by Cessna.[11]<br>  <br>  The plane crashed shortly after takeoff about 200 feet (60 m) from the runway. Aaliyah, pilot Luis Morales III and the seven other passengers, including her hair stylist Eric Forman, Anthony Dodd, her security guard Scott Gallin, Douglas Kratz (a director of video production for Virgin Records), stylist Christopher Maldonado, Keith Wallace and Gina Smith (both employees of the Blackground label) died.[12]|`|8bTder08aa	Aaliyah died because the people in her entourage who were responsible for making arrangements for her got so swollen-headed with their own self-importance that they believed that God would suspend the laws of physics for them.  They told the pilot that if he didn't load the plane with all their baggage and equipment, they'd make sure he'd never work again.  The pilot did as they demanded and everyone died.<br>  <br>  Aaliyah died because people she depended on were conceited and stupid-- a very bad combination.  If the pilot of an airplane tells you the airplane can't carry everything you want to put on it, it's a good idea to listen to him.<br>  <br>  (FWIW, reports from around the Bahamas indicated that several air taxi and charter companies refused to deal with Aaliyah's people because they felt that the arrogance and ignorance these people displayed made it impossible to deal with them without putting someone in danger.  So Aaliyah's people ended up doing business with the worst charter company in the area, because nobody else would deal with them.  Their bad luck that the pilot had a cocaine habit and was susceptible to threats-- he caved in to their demands and died with them.)|`|7Vka1VcOaa	She died in 2001 in a plane crash. Rock the Boat came out the same year.|`|l8djUFdDaa	The Pilot was in-experienced and they over-loaded the plane (extra from the video shoot) And Aaliyah was in a rush to return home.....So worst case scenario happened..And she died in 2001 thats when Rock da boat came out and she was just returning home from shooting the video and thats when the plane crashed:-(..She was amazing|`|fOHn1ISdaa	She died in the 9/11 World Trade Center Plane Crash<br>  <br>  and her song was made in 1972

9W3nLL6iaa	"Indian Love Call" by Slim Whitman
zovrJ0yXaa	*spoilers*<br>  <br>  the book is set in a world which is constantly on the brink of nuclear war. america and russia are threatening to destroy each other, and the world with it. the worlds smartest man, a former superhero, devises a plan to unite the world by creating an enemy that nations can unite against. in the book, it is an alien squid, in the movie, it is a hero with the power to create and destroy as he pleases. in both cases, the man executes the plan and unites the world by sacrificing the population of new york. essentially, he creates peace by murdering millions. the book is extraordinary but personally i felt the movie failed to capture a lot of the essence of the book. try reading that instead|`|2qvRFVWRaa	i never read the graphic novel and i am also lost.|`|mLZco0Q1aa	The only way your gonna understand the movie is if you read the graphic novel. TRUST ME|`|hQWucH5uaa	It is a long boring movie that tries too hard to be profound.<br>  <br>  The blue naked guy is yet another movie interpretation of Frederiche Nietszche's "Ubermensch" (the overman or superman) in the same tradition as the Roy Batty replicant in BLADE RUNNER or the David McCullum character in the 1963 OUTER LIMIT episode "The Sixth Finger"; except in THE WATCHMEN the blue naked guy bears a strong resemblance to 'Den' from HEAVY METAL MAGAZINE.<br>  <br>  As you should know, Nietszche's Ubermensch/Dr. Manhattan is the Overman/Superman, beyond good & evil, beyond love or hate, beyond morality (hence his nakedness); beyond revenge.  The Superman is to an ordinary human to what a human is to an amoeba.<br>  <br>  There is also an Teleological explanation of the universe using Deism and Deist Watchmaker analogy to the existance of God.  That the universe runs like a clock, and God is the clock maker, who winds it up and lets it go with no more interference from him.  Dr. Manhattan's father was a watchmaker who taught Jon (the young Dr. Manhattan) how to make, construct, and put-together watches from all the assembled pieces.  Dr. Manhattan is constantly exploding objects into their composite pieces and then reassembles them (or destroys them), including atoms and sub-atomic particles, in a Grand Watchmaker analogy.<br>  <br>  Rorshach, a victim of psychological and physical child abuse, is a clinicall depressed  'survivor' and represents apathy to the point of nihilism.  In a refutation of Nietzsche's maxim: That which does not destroy me makes me stronger, the much abused Rorschach demands a mercy killing from Dr. Manhattan and gets a euthanasic blast at the end of the movie (he just can't go on).<br>  <br>  There are several other metaphors and analogies throughout this long and dull movie.  Like I wrote, WATCHMEN tries too hard to be profound (just like the movie THE DARK KNIGHT).  It uses college level basic philosophy & theology of Deism and Nietzchean existentialism throughout its plot.  At least in my opinion.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	yeah it made me **** in my pants

xTioPxaVaa	If you put a .105 guage string on your guitar, you could conceivably tune down an entire octave.  But, then what would the bass guitar do?<br>  <br>  You've been watching Metalocalypse too much....just because it's low doesn't make it heavy (unless you record it in the Marianis Trench;).<br>  <br>  What makes heavy is tone, arrangement, and attitude.  And if you want to tune down some to make the song work with the vocalist, then that's cool.<br>  <br>  That said, tune your guitar as low as you want, and then duke it out with the bass player.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|eK2xCiFbaa	Dropped D?Don't be ridiculous....  First off you can get a 7 string or lower guage strings and go for a dropped A, but I suppose there's no limit for how low it can go as long as the string stays taught.  I'd imagine you could even tune the strings an octave below normal tuning and go for a super low dropped D, but you may even be able to go further than that|`|nbZMSCkSaa	+1 on there being no particular limit.

This incident sparks a life change, and as a result Sunako shuns all forms of beauty, both in herself as well as in life. Concerned by her change for the worst, Sunako's aunt, the owner of a beautiful mansion where four very handsome students live, offers the guys free rent in her mansion if they can turn Sunako into a "perfect lady<br>  <br>  ?[VAMPIRE KNIGHT and GUILTY]?<br>  Yuki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, wherein she was attacked by a vampire... And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adapted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend whoâs hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.<br>  <br>  ?[JUNJOUN ROMANTICA]?

Confused by all of his brand new emotions, Misaki struggles to deal with his suddenly very odd life. And if that wasnât enough, his suitor, Usami, has plenty of issues of his own. A man-child who decorates his room in giant teddy bears and toys, Usami is a famous novelist who also writes steamy boysâ love novels on the side. When Misaki cracks open one of these books and reads sentences like âMisaki licks every inch of Usamiâs hot bodyââ¦well, letâs just say that all hell breaks loose.<br>  <br>  ?[INUYASHA]?<br>  Kagome leads a fairly normal life, in spite of her weird family. Her house is a thousand-year-old Japanese temple, and her grandfather talks about the history of the house endlessly. Legend has it that the old well on the temple grounds keeps a vicious ancient monster at bay; Kagome never believed those legends, until now. The well opens up and sucked Kagome inside - transporting her to an ancient time of enchanted forests and giant demons.<br>  <br>  Kagome is soon confronted by her odd resemblance to Kikuyo, the girl who controlled the magical Shikon no Tama talisman and imprisoned the legendary half-demon Inu-Yasha. Upon entering this fantasy world, Kagome is attacked by a demon hunting the Shikon no Tama; she unwittingly releases Inu-Yasha from his imprisonment, only to find that he's no hero.<br>  <br>  ?[GRAVITATION]? contains shounen ai <a href="http://www.animekiwi.com/gravitation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animekiwi.com/gravitation/</a><br>  All Shuichi ever dreamed about was following in the footsteps of his pop idol.

4S5NnT7aaa	That's actually quite difficult.<br>  <br>  Sherlock Holmes is too much of an individualist to join, and even if he did, he'd insist on Watson coming with him.  John Melmoth (AKA Melmoth the Wanderer) is a creation of the horror writer Charles Maturin who, although a fascinating character, probably has too much in common with Dorian Grey to be usable. Robur the Conqueror, the master of the airship Clipper of the Clouds (by Jules Verne) is similarly a bit too like Captain Nemo. Tarzan is an interesting possibility, although Edgar Rice Burroughs first novel about him doesn't come out until 1912.<br>  <br>  The Time Traveller from H G Wells' 'The Time Machine' is one possibility.  He's a brilliant mechanical and electrical scientist, and seems to have enough strength and survival skills to cope when wandering around in the future and dealing with the Morlocks. Personally, I think he's a bit two-dimensional, and his field of expertise is limited, although I suppose it does open up the possibility of a plot either involving time travel, stopping the bad guys mastering it, or fixing some temporal anomaly.<br>  <br>  Best of luck finding others!|`|hQWucH5uaa	The Wolf Man<br>  <br>  Igor<br>  <br>  Captain Ahab<br>  <br>  Dr. Who<br>  <br>  Daniel Boone<br>  <br>  Davy Crocket<br>  <br>  Mike Fink<br>  <br>  Johnny Appleseed<br>  <br>  Ichabod Crane<br>  <br>  John Henry<br>  <br>  Florence Nightingale<br>  <br>  Little Dorrit<br>  <br>  The Man Who Would Be King (Daniel Dravot)<br>  <br>  Hiawatha<br>  <br>  Lord Jim

wXaGIPSPaa	Clark is clumsy and nerdy....superman always attracts the hotties.  Louis swoons over him cause of his super good looks and smarts.<br>  Only two things can bring Superman to his knees: kryptonite, and the charms of a lovely lady.<a href="http://superman.ugo.com/girls/lois_lane/" rel="nofollow">http://superman.ugo.com/girls/lois_lane/</a>|`|dfjIBHe3aa	To put this as simply as possible, there are certain conventions for drawing figures in any melodramatic situation: comics, those bible booklets, old racist propaganda, pulp illustrations.  Flash Gordon, Doc Savage in the pulp illustrations, Sherlock Holmes and so forth look very similar because they are supposed to be the Hero.<br>  <br>  So is Superman.  Different hairstyle though not that different from the original Buck Rogers (and George Tuska was both the last artist on the original Buck Rogers Daily Strip and one of Superman's artists in the seventies -- long after he got that hairstyle) but otherwise similar.  Jerry Siegal and Wayne Boring, who really set Superman's look, were NOT the world's greatest draftsmen, but they were very clearly drawing him, in their contexts, as the Hero.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just remembered that another hero who shared Superman and Buck Rogers's hair style was Scorchy Smith.  Tuska was, I believe, Rodlow Willard's assistant -- and definitely his successor on that strip till it ended in the nineteen fifties.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think Brandon Rouse or even Brad Pitt or Hugh Jackman.  Think Tom Cruise.  That's what Superman is supposed to look like: like a young Tom Cruise.|`|pgIcxpiaaa	i dont really know,but all i know is he's got a friggin curl n his forhead :O<br>  but i dont think he's that good looking in the comics.they draw him all muscly though,like he's on steroids >.<|`|NdexDGXWaa	I dont think he's good looking in the comic or movie but thats what I think!:D

ythN9BQgaa	Leo rising<br>  Aquarius in 7th house<br>  <br>  I've never dated an Aquarius but I've been attracted to one. Actually, she was one of my friends and I started to have feelings for her. I started crying sometimes because I knew she wouldn't feel the same way about me. I never told her. But now, I still love her but not how I used to. I want to be friends with her forever. <br>  <br>  Other than her, I get into fights with most Aquarians. I don't know why, but most of them had that "fight me" type of personality. But still had many friends for some reason. <br>  <br>  I do admit though, I love their unpredictable personalities. Keeps me interested. <br>  <br>  Gemini sun<br>  Scorpio moon<br>  Leo rising|`|edJtHlDiaa	I have libra rising and my first love was an aries guy,and i have ceres in the 7th house,and i was really in love with him,but he was very abusive with me and not a good guy.I don't know what ceres in the 7th house means.|`|B7WIZdglaa	Gemini is in my 7th house... and yes, I love geminis!

I have never been in a relationship nor been attracted to an Aries man, though I haven't gotten close enough to one on a deeper level to establish that connection. I'm very picky about giving my heart, and most of the time I feel little to no attraction to people. I must say that I do admire and enjoy the company of the Aries personality, and I generally tend to get on well with Aries men in general if just as friends. I do like a guy who can stand up for himself a be a leader. I must say though that having Aries on the descendant makes me a bit competitive and bossy in relationships, and when I'm with guys who are more passive (Like my current boyfriend) it can be a challenge.|`|AA11899483	scorpio rising and i have taurus in 7th, no planets but vesta is there, i have friends that are taureans, but ive never been attracted to them, ive always had an obsessive attraction to those whose planets fall in my 8th house though, which is in gemini,  its not always like a good feeling, it can be bad aswell, its like magnetic and scary at times. <br>  <br>  i want to get married someday, but i need space, alot of it. though im not those that will let go of the relationship if i dont get enough of my freedom, i will stay in a relationship no matter what, unless i see that there is no happiness left for me or my partner anymore.

76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	From the first episode, I predicted it would be Quest as the winners and Beat Freaks as the runners up and I still stand by that. As much as I love Beat Freaks and as much as I'd love to see a female crew win for once, I'd be perfectly happy seeing them place a well-deserved second place. No other all-female crew ever made it that far,so that's a feat in itself. But Quest Crew were amazing as usual and they've been so far ahead of the competition the whole season, so i really hope they win.|`|PYRjacj1aa	I think that Quest Crew is the best, i think that they are going to win abdc!!!!|`|rabjcdjHaa	I was hoping the Beat Freaks would win the show, but after last night I think Quest Crew will win ABDC!

RavvDVpVaa	When Biz Markie was sued by Gilbert O'Sullivan for using an uncleared sample and it changed the sampling laws forever, to where now if you use a recognizable sample the original artist can demand 60-100% of your publishing for using their music. That's part of the reason in my opinion why the production side of hip-hop has gotten more basic and less complex over the years, because it costs soo much money to sample. You have to use really obscure ish to and or use creative ways to cover up the sample, so the sample police won't come after you lol. Take your favorite album for example It takes a million... (i'm just guessing lol) there was hundreds of samples on that album, but that was back in 88 before the laws changed, today from a financial standpoint a record like that can never be released again because of Gilbert O'Sullivan suing biz markie to where the laws changed. DJ Premier said once that in the 90's, he would choose hip-hop over eating, that's what he meant, they would take soo much money out of his publishing that he was barely making ends meet, at one time him and guru were living at Branford Marsalis' house.<br>  Edit:<br>  That's why I think premier's style has become more basic over the years, he probably figured he paid his dues, over all those years.|`|Niygpxktaa	Thinking a little outside the box here...<br>  <br>  ...but I think the legal woes in hip-hop during the late 80s-early 90s (i.e. 2 Live Crew & Luther Campbell, NWA vs the FBI, etc.) were crucial to hip-hop's growth and development. <br>  It added a tangible sense of struggle against the establishment, taking some of the earlier political rhetoric in rap a step further.<br>  <br>  It also fostered an  "us against them"  attitude that helped it flourish in areas with long histories of  unrest and struggle, namely the west and south. That help hip-hop gain a stronger foothold in areas where it was just beginning to take root.|`|hcbY89Praa	Tupac vs. Biggie I guess, it kinda brought rap to the forefront....

If anyone would have been able to do it, it would have been her.  Clearly, she wasn't successful.

bdttDnlwaa	Ok.<br>  <br>  A Transit is when a World Planet comes into a Conjunction with one of your Natal Chart Planets or Points.<br>  <br>  For instance, at this point in time, (25th February 2009), Jupiter is 11 degree Aquarius.<br>  If you have for instance Chiron, or the Point of Fortune, or the Moon, 11 degree Aquarius, then a Transit is taking place.<br>  <br>  Now,<br>  a Progressed Chart is acknowledging that the Astrological Wheel keeps moving, and this since  the very first minute that you were born.<br>  <br>  There are several ways of progressing a Chart.<br>  <br>  But here are two ways.<br>  <br>  The first way is very simple : you move everything in the Chart by one degree a year.<br>  For instance a child of 10 born with the Sun in 7 degree Scorpio, would now have his Progressed Sun in 17 degree Scorpio.<br>  If the same child has his House IV in 3 degree Aquarius, now his Progressed House IV is in 13 Aquarius.<br>  Etc.<br>  <br>  The second is not a degree per year, but a day per year.<br>  Like this : if a child is born on the 5th of July 1999, and is now 10 years old, then the new Progressed Chart is the one of the 15th of July 1999. That is 10 days later.<br>  Obviously here, the slow moving Planets do not change place that much, but the fast moving Planets do.<br>  The Moon, Sun, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, (just about ! When you are getting old that is ! My Saturn has moved now one degree because I am over 50), are the fast moving Planets.<br>  Bear in mind that some Planets do go Retrograde.<br>  You need a good Ephemeris.<br>  <br>  It is quite smart to pay attention to this, because things do change in a person's life, when something like a transition occurs from one Sign into another, for instance.<br>  To give an example : when the Progressed House IV moves out of Scorpio and into Sagittarius.<br>  Or when a Progressed Planet suddenly encounters an important placement in the Chart, such as the  placement of the Sun or Ascendant.<br>  To give an example : when Progressed Mars moves into a Conjunction with the Ascendant.<br>  <br>  I hope this answered your question.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|MF9YknDYaa	you do know it's all BS don't you?

CLEAN the wound properly TAKE IT OUT first though the piercing that is and properly treat it, since it's a piercing and hurts you need to get to the doctor! first to help you here<br>  <br>  EDIT! OH IF YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR HEAD IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT'S A BIG SIGN OF INFECTION! GET TO THE DOCTOR BUT CLEAN IT MAKE SURE ITS CLEAN FIRST!<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember, the most important thing to do when confronted with an open wound is to control bleeding. If the victim is not you, follow universal precautions, using personal protective equipment if available.<br>  Cleaning an Open Wound<br>  Once bleeding has been controlled, the open wound should be cleaned with mild soap and water (see illustration). Liquid soaps do a great job, and there is no need for fancy antibacterial soaps. Be sure to rinse the entire depth of the cut, and rinse the soap from the surface thoroughly.<br>  <br>  Water sometimes has a tendency to sting. Saline solution (0.9% salt solution) can be a little easier on tender skin. Bottled water can do double duty in a first aid kit that's tight on space or weight (you can wash with it or drink it), but saline solution is better for cleaning wounds and eyes.<br>  <br>  Keeping a wound clean is as important as cleaning it the first time. If it seems a wound has become contaminated or dirty after it was been cleaned and dressed, remove the dressing and clean it again. Keeping a wound clean is the best way to avoid infection.<br>  <br>  Cleaning an open wound can sometimes cause bleeding to return. The bleeding will be minor and should be easily stopped with direct pressure using a sterile - or at least clean - dressing. Once the bleeding has been stopped, it's time to dress the wound.<br>  Dressing an Open Wound<br>  Don't dress a wound without first cleaning it as well as possible. Do not dress a wound with visible contamination. If you can't get it clean, leave it open and seek medical attention.<br>  <br>  Once the wound is clean and not bleeding, dab a bit of antiseptic ointment on it to keep out the germs. Cover the wound lightly with an adhesive dressing. If body hair gets in the way of an adhesive dressing, you may wrap the extremity loosely with a wide roller gauze. Always change dressings every 12 hours.<br>  <br>  For lacerations and incisions, pull the edges of the wound together and use butterfly enclosures to hold them. Avulsions with a flap of skin can be closed and butterfly enclosures applied as well. Apply antiseptic ointment over butterfly enclosures and cover with a bandage as above. Superficial wounds, those that are not deep enough to see subcutaneous (fatty) tissue, do not need butterfly enclosures.<br>  <br>  GO TO THE DOCTOR/ER / CALL 911<br>  <br>  MY DAD IS ON A HEART PUMP FOR AN INFECTION!<br>  <br>  You can get LOCKJAW and LOSE A LIMB or DIE if you don't treat the wound/infection properly and thoroughly with professional help!|`|htxwTAAQaa	That's why piercings are ridiculous.  They infect too easily (by the way it probably is infected if you're in that much pain).  You should see a doctor probably, to get some antibiotics prescribed.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Seek medical advice ASAP, call your doctor. The swelling and soreness means you've most likely got an infection, this is your body's reaction. You may need some antibiotics and an antiseptic cream. <br>  Good luck. =]

Klb4ZYcVaa	I've seen all of these films before the Oscars, all of them were great. The only ones that mde me cry in the end were Milk, The Reader & Slumdog. My bets were: Sean Penn for best actor b/c he viewed this whole story, this whole movie as acting. He played a gay politician, eventually he had to kiss other guys. He views this as acting, & he deserved that Oscar, much more than Rourke. My bet was Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet as a tie to win, Streep should have her own category b/c the lady's a f*cking legend, she was just terrific in Doubt. However, The Reader was probably the most beautiful romantic movie I've ever seen throughout this year, & Kate Winslet did alot of nude scenes. Many actresses are never comfortable being nude on set, however Winslet viewed this as acting. She saw this as a pure love story, she wanted to make this love real. That's acting, & she deserved that Oscar too. Especially she was nominated WAY too many times, it about damn time. As for Best Picture, I have betted double for Slumdog. Accoring to 5 SAG, 4 Golden Globes, 7 BAFTAS awards, of course it was gonna win. Best Picture catoegry focuses on an overall plot, screenplay, direction, cinemetography, not big names actors. That's what i liked about the film. It showed us what really happens in India, & the only person in the whole world, who would go to a Millionaire show to prove his love for a girl, not money. It definetly deserved Best Picture, the direction & colors were simply amazing, Boyle just showed us from his point of view. I'm very happy at this year's Oscars.|`|Ssdie1pUaa	Slumdog hands down! It was insanely original with excellent music and    best of all had a great ending (which Benjamin button, and milk both lacked) <br>  I also think the fact that (assuming you hadn't read the book) slumdog was so suspenseful whereas considering both Milk and Frost/Nixon were based on true events, you already knew the outcome.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Personally I thought it should have been Milk or Curious Case. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I loved Slumdog, and although the direction, story and music was a great part of it, I felt the acting wasn't strong enough.|`|02f6e89a635c7219ed21b4ba1e0467daaa	Reservation Road had the best acting, directing, and script this year.|`|lawMUua3aa	Milk|`|6a5c94bc1ee9c654afdd244e1069448daa	Benjamin Button.

Bk1t83pFaa	It depends upon what sign the Venus is in - you've gotta check out someone's entire natal chart to find that. For example, if a Scorpio Sun has a Gemini Venus, obviously the way they approach sex and love is going to be more like a Gemini.  Likewise, if a Libra Sun (for example) has a Scorpio Venus, his/her sex will be more like a Scorpio.  My mom, however, is a Scorpio Sun with a Scorpio Venus as well...so she is a very deep-feeling, intense, possessive, and passionate person...and I don't really want to envision her love-life right now (lol) but I've never heard my dad complain.  <br>  <br>  Find out what your Venus sign is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal" rel="nofollow">http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  Then compare it to someone else's:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/venusvenussynastry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/ve...</a>|`|jcL7gDMKaa	The body parts that are ruled by Scorpio are the genitals and cervix!

Scorpio govern the sexual organ and has an extremely good reputation of being the best in bed and the best lover!! Hope this helps. And yes, Aries and Scorpio are good in bed. Fire and water... Steam comes out!!!!|`|aIyaB53Naa	Scorpio can't have Venus in Gemini .. only possibilities for Scorpio are Venus in Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius or Capricorn. <br>  <br>  I'm Virgo with Leo venus and Aries mars ...

srtoPxN2aa	I'll go with Split Enz, as I've always enjoyed them very much. In particular their True Colours, Second Thoughts, Frenzy, Dizrythmia, Time and Tide, and Waiata albums. The latter is where 'One Step Ahead' can be found...fantastic album, and the album opener 'Hard Act To Follow' was also quite good:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGTSUeyt-nY&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=2C936E692832E00F&index=22" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGTSUeyt-...</a><br>  I still own all of their albums on vinyl, including a mint condition, 'laser-etched' black vinyl limited edition pressing of 'True Colours', along with an Audiophile Half Speed Master as well, which sounds incredible.<br>  Here's a few more favorites of mine...<br>  I See Red:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKj4upY1VYI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKj4upY1V...</a><br>  I Got You:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmQlBfxh4Us&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmQlBfxh4...</a><br>  You need to have an imeem account in order to hear this song...<br>  What's The Matter With You:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/rockmusic15/music/dQ_znQXQ/split-enz-whats-the-matter-with-you/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/rockmusic15/music/d...</a>|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Split Enz <br>  <br>  Every now and then they would do some cool Progressive not very often but once in a while.

You can go backwards and put two guitars in, BUT, this will sound like crap. The speaker of a guitar amp has a lot of high's and lows, and when you run two guitars into one amp, your sound will get muddy, distorted, and could quite possibly damage the amp or speakers. It's NEVER recommended to do it.<br>  <br>  Plus, you have TWO pretty sweet guitars, and ONE horrible amp. The Marshall MG series is rated as one as the worst amps in history... especially Marshall history. The amp already has a muddy sound... no matter how loud you go, it just sounds like crap. You can't possibly run two guitars out of it and get a decent mix between the two guitars.|`|C4K15K62aa	my friend, this is an easy question, you can get splitter jacks that optimize the input into allowing two inputs, but Its never reliable, two guitars out of the same amp is always so muddy, unless your both channeled, but that only works when there are two deliberate separate inputs on an amp.|`|KzRH5LjZaa	splitter|`|F7YIgldRaa	It probably depends on the wattage of the marshall but you'll need to get some type of splitter so you can have two inputs.

Yw1k1W19aa	I can't believe that they do work in the capacity you mean - that is as a tool for fortune telling.<br>  <br>  To begin with, tarot cards are playing cards. They were invented in mid 15th century Italy for the Milanese court. Tarot consists of a standard Latin suited pack of playing cards with a fifth suit of picture cards. These extra cards took as their theme, not an occult philosophy, but a Christian triumph procession - hence their early name of trionfi, meaning triumphs and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the invention of trumps in card games. And this is what they were invented for, a family of card games that continues to be played throughout continental Europe to this day!<br>  <br>  Without an occult origin, fortune telling is no different in kind from fortune telling with tea leaves, dominoes, or knuckle bones - and with them, faintly rediculous.<br>  <br>  However, for fortune telling to work does, as you mention, require that the future somehow influence the order of a pack of cards in the present. This is called reverse causation and because of this, it falls foul of many of the same logical problems and paradoxes that plague the idea of time travel.<br>  <br>  Of course, it is worth remembering that James Randi has long held a cheque for $1 million dollars for anyone who can demonstrate that this sort of thing can be done - it remains unclaimed.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the one way tarot cards do indeed work, is for their intended use - games. You can bet that any family of games which has spread throughout a continent and endured for nearly 600 years is going to be good.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	I personally believe that Tarot cards work and use them frequently, and have for probably close to fifteen years. My maternal grandmother read and taught me secretly (my father was very religious and would not have approved.) <br>  How do they work? <br>  I believe they simply reflect the will of the reader; they serve as a focal point for the readers energies. I think its a Divine presence guiding the cards. But I don't expect everyone to believe that.|`|NQURVW9Zaa	My opinion is...tarot card reading will not give you the truth.And it's not working at all but it's nice to hear every good word about our future.I don't believe in tarot card and someone who can tell me about my future because all answers are usuall for most people.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	sorry but no|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello gspecial<br>  <br>  Yes they work, they work well for meditation, psychic & personal development as well as guidance, insight & future projection/possibilities. <br>  <br>  Sadhara

The truth is at the start Danni felt threatened by Cheryl, when all the rumour's started going round that Danni will not be asked to sign a new contract.   She started to be-friend Cheryl coincidence?? <br>  <br>  Any remember Sharon Osbourne one of the original judges? She left because of Danni's two faced way's.  Danni is not as sweet as she looks she knows how to play on peoples heart strings and at the moment Cheryl's are playing a tune.<br>  <br>  To be honest with you, I did use to like Danni but its when I first saw her in X-Factor She just got my back up. <br>  <br>  Just look at the season just gone, every time she picked songs for Rachel, the songs did not work with her voice, when Rachel picked her own songs they were fantastic.  There has been rumors for ages that Danni never liked Rachel in the first place, and because of this Rachel feelings to ward's Danni were mutual.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/danni-minogue-slams-x-factor-bosses-over-editing-of-her-footage_100117278.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/indi...</a>  <br>  <br>  the link above will take you to a article re guarding Danni and Rachel. Danni state's that the clips where edited for TV, I on the other hand think not, the tapes showed Danni's true side.  <br>  <br>  I think Cheryl needs to open her eyes and see that Danni is using her.|`|eIBPisAAaa	i agree with cheryl why should one go and not the other if neither of them have done nothing wrong !!!!!|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	I disagree

4zVi6gvgaa	I can play by ear way better than I can sight read, and its not something you can learn from a computer program. There aren't any tricks to it, you just have to get to really become accustomed to the piano, know where everything is so it can't surprise you with anything, and then listen really closely to the music. Also, when you listen to music, try to dissect it as much as you can, separating every instrument in your mind, and then you can easily single out one and listen to only what its doing, even the bass. Then when your at the piano, when you here the note, just play around with the keys til you find the correct one. I hate to sound like a teacher, but the only way to get good at it is through practice.|`|gxIvCkUyaa	i cheat.<br>  when i hear chords, i listen to what the main note sounds like.<br>  i sing it into a tuner.<br>  the tuner gives me a note<br>  i search for the right chord, and voila!<br>  <br>  for sight reading, you just need to practise.<br>  keeping in time and knowing how short or long the notes have to be played etc.|`|j6NULSo6aa	idk but i learned by ear|`|WpUxjPWxaa	Are you taking piano lessons? Well, that is the best way for you to start off with. Don't take a short cut, you will mess it up again. You would be able to learn to play piano by ear once you are good enough. If talented , people are able to learn to play piano by ear very quickly in a short period of time than others but that is really rare. First, find a good piano teacher and learn basics, theory and sight reading!

Those are the other bands that I listen to that are most similar to the ones you mentioned.|`|4Z0G5x52aa	Cradle of Filth is good.

You cannot reserve tickets online or though the mail. Supply isn't anywhere near as high as demand, so expect a few busy signals and book your visit well in advance. Call the audience hot line at (312) 633-1000 and make a reservation. Keep in mind that the show tapes in Chicago, so if you are far from The Windy City, you'll need to book travel and accommodations. Note that the show doesn't shoot during June, July and December, so avoid those months. "The Oprah Winfrey Show" doesn't allow audience members under the age of 18, and identification/proof of age is required before you can enter the studio. <br>  Step2Group reservations aren't available, but you can book up to four tickets at a time. There are morning and afternoon tapings each day. The first taping usually ends around 11 AM and the afternoon taping ends around 3 PM. You should eat before arriving, as food isn't available in the studio. You should also avoid wearing beige or white, as it may be too reflective for the studio lights. <br>  Step3Last but not least, have fun!

Bu2asnXFaa	I don't' think a man can be "stolen".  A man makes his own decisions, just like a woman.  However, I do think it's possible that the relationship was lacking something (what I don't' know, only you know that) and that it takes two to make a relationship so you do need to analyze and accept your part in the relationship between the two of you.  But you don't need to accept a part in the relationship he formed with this other woman, because that he did all on his own. A real man would have come to you and addressed the problem, not found comfort somewhere else.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	wow, first of all.. if he takes off with soemeone else.. why would I want him back, he decided to go no pne put a gun to his head, do not let him make you feel at fault, a man is gunna do as he pleases.

Of course the other problem is that they are being told if only they would do things differently the abuser wouldn't have lost his temper and hit her.<br>  So their thinking is affected by his sorry propaganda.<br>  If a guy hits you...leave.  He will hit you again.<br>  And again, and again.<br>  <br>  Its not a mistake, it would be a mistake if the abusers hit someone capable of hitting back, some big guy for instance.<br>  But they don't, they hit women.|`|5jMNBO2naa	not a mistake<br>  as that type of beating is way beyond a slap<br>  as for Rhianna, she has no self esteem<br>  she is classic abused women syndrome<br>  and i would not doubt there is more than meets the eye<br>  this was the incident that got them noticed<br>  her career will take a dive, much like Whitney Houston's did when she married Bobby Brown<br>  <br>  what is it with pretty black women singers, why do they have such low self esteem and pick idiots for men in their lives?<br>  <br>  Chris Brown effed up, but Rhianna was the one who made the mistake<br>  so she has to bear some of the blame for even staying with him|`|xLllDu18aa	a mistake if he only hit her once and realise "oo damn i did something wrong" and stop...<br>  <br>  but what he did was unacceptable... he kept on hiting her while he was still driving ! then he bit her while he was still driving still ! he grab the phone when she was trying to call for help. and he threating her too. <br>  <br>  i used to like chris brown but after i read the police report i was shock ! idk what to think anymore... but i do know he should go to jail for what he did and get help..|`|SvzsXddUaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  A STUPID, DUMB mistake by hitting Rihanna.<br>  <br>  Oh, and he should KNOW how the media portray us Black people, and d***, he just added more negativity to it!<br>  <br>  He's young and dumb as h***.<br>  <br>  A sad dumb***, I tell you, a SAD, SAD one.<br>  <br>  And don't get me started on Rihanna for taking him back too!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I can only trust these so called fans of his get a little more life experience under their belt they will get the impact of his brutal decision.

These girls are either naive or ignorant. If Brown has hit Rhianna once, he will no doubt hit her again. Its just sad.|`|5vRU2dWkaa	IM ON TEAM RIRI!|`|inSxwDhWaa	I am an older CB fan and I don't think this was a mistake, Chris did not stop for one second and think of Rihanna's feelings, about his fans and her fans. <br>  If she was shouting and hitting him, he should have got out of the car, ran away and called her people to come and get her. He should never never never have touched her. <br>  And she should never have touched him too but that's another story which the media are not talking about. <br>  <br>  Chris is young and immature and he has been raised with some poor morals. He is still a teenager, but a teenager with too much money and power who is allowed to run wild. <br>  <br>  His mother needed to get him help after he saw his step-dad beating her. <br>  His parents and entourage of staff on his payroll should have helped steer this boy in the right direction instead of living off him and letting him do whatever he wanted to do, just because he is paying their mortgage, keeping them in Gucci watches and flying on private jet planes doesn't mean they should turn a blind eye. <br>  <br>  As an older fan I can say that what Chris did was crazy and yes Rihanna probably was hitting him too, but their relationship was toxic and they should have been separated months ago. <br>  <br>  I think Chris should retire from singing and go and write songs for other artists, his career will never quite recover and it will be hard for him to sing 'Damage' and 'Take you down' when he has done this.  <br>  <br>  The media now need to focus on helping other teenagers and putting a stop to domestic violence, not hanging Chris. <br>  <br>  His perfect career and image have been shred to pieces. I am sad to say this but I hope Chris does not return to a singing career, i will miss his dancing and live performances but he needs to disappear.

NGNeT3rYaa	Yes she did, she confided in her trusty beaver the truth that Rex's father was alive and well in Llanview! When will she ever learn!|`|AA12390047	She told him that his father was a bad man and that he was dead, he did horrible things to her and that she killed him. Then after Rex left, she was talking to Morris (her stuffed beaver?) and told him as she's dabbing at her eyes that sometimes a mother has to lie (or something to that effect) and that now he'll never know that his father is really alive and in Llanview. She gave such a convincing performance about the guy being a scumbag (didn't give particulars of what he did, just that he was bad) that she convinced Rex to drop it.<br>  <br>  Illene is a fantastic actress|`|jfriQ8pmaa	Like the others said, She did lie to Rex.....again....then confided in the beaver that he is near....she didn't actually say he is in Llanview.  Roxy wanted her to swear he would drop the subject forever, he kinda skipped around that as Rex does, so we know he will not drop it!  <br>  <br>  I love the mystery in this, wonder who it is......don't think it is Mitch, unless she is the only one who knows he is alive.....because she said he is alive and nearby.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Yep you heard right; Roxy lied to Rex again about the identity of his father.  She was telling her tabletop stuffed Beaver Morris that the daddy is a really bad man who's very much alive and there in Llanview.  So that leads me to believe that it isn't Spencer Truman, Mitch Lawrence or Victor Lord and who does that leave?...Um...Miles Lawrence!<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|AA11202477	Okay, this is getting to me. I went to IMDb to see who's still in Llanview. Unless Mitch Laurence is there and only Roxie knows it, I can't find anyone who could remotely be called a scumbag, exept (perhaps) for that creep of a mayor of Llanview. Since I'm sick of the whole Marty/John/Blair thing (why would either want him - if he had a real emotion it would bring him to his knees), this will be the storyline I watch. Especially since I love Ilene Kristen - she's just a hoot. I loved when she said Dorian was David "significant mother".|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Yeah she lied. She told her stuffed gorundhog thing that Rex's dad is walking around town and closer than ever.|`|7p9wmL8Yaa	Yeah she did. She said that his real father is very alive, & closer than he know's. Has me wondering who his Daddy is?!|`|xtNK0sTuaa	You know with the story dragging on and on and all the twists and turns, I don't even care anymore.<br>  But I know that Roxy lied to Rex.|`|4sIyzL7Baa	Roxy lied to Rex again.  Why doesn't she just level with him?  He can handle the truth.

DaokQBKhaa	Making this question exclusive to non-British people may be construed as quite 'close-minded'. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't take everything the news says to be true.

PIeronuZaa	*TIME FOR A RECESSION SOLUTION*<br>  <br>  VOTE: Sky Witch for Congresswoman|`|PpWosZsIaa	Script Drugs are much cheaper in Canada.<br>  <br>  The United States Recession has had a terrible Global effect. The US Recession started the Global Recession. Reason: We are one of if not Richest 'Super Powers' in the G-8. When the US bleeds red ink, the rest of the world bleeds red ink.|`|d23F89ECaa	Actually,<br>  <br>  It's the American recession that is effecting Canada as America and Canada share the largest trading agreement in the world.<br>  <br>  And everything has always cost more here as everything is based on the American currency.  But priced in Canadian currency.  Right now, the two are almost at par, so mostly, everything costs less than it did say ten years ago than when the American dollar was only worth 50 Canadian Cents.<br>  <br>  But there is a wide variety between prices across Canada than it does in America.  In the States, there is a nation wide standard on pricing on most retail items.  In Canada, it is provincial so something in one province may cost more or less than the province beside it.  The economy has very little to do with that.<br>  <br>  But, as the American currency goes down, the Canadian currency does as well and for that reason, the price of every day items will raise.|`|09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	My thanks to "Those We Do Not Speak Of" for such a clarifying answer. <br>  <br>  It's outrageous that no one in our US government was minding the store and let  this economic situation occur again, shades of 1927.

QJIXTpZ5aa	Honestly,I like it.<br>  <br>  ^-^;|`|R28qkqSyaa	I LOVE IT! that sounds really good, i'm being serious. i really want to read it ^-^ i love the names too, (lol you might be able to tell which one specifcally)you might want to be a little more specific in some area's like why she has to fake her death (sounds good though)and i'm sure this is just a summary and that that part would be explained in the story. but you might want to take it off here before someone takes your idea, i've seen this happen before unfortunatly >< you could put it in alot of places if you want people to read it, like manga forums and other fanfiction sites, and if you can't draw and you really want to get serious with this then you could get/hire someone else to draw for you.<br>  ~good luck with you're manga, i hope i'll get to read it someday ^-^~|`|yacLHWqEaa	GREATEST IDEA  EVA! IF IT IS SELLING IN STORES I WOULD TOTALLY BUY IT!!!!|`|REfvEVe8aa	i love it tell me when your finished so i can read it i don't think anyone will say anything bad about it remember tell me when your finished|`|X3dfHBGGaa	wow I like it.How many volumes are there going to be?|`|qp3LY0tRaa	i would read it, it sounds rly good :)|`|WeqoJbIdaa	If you manage to make more points clear, this could turn out to be a good story, but I have a question.  I don't get why she has to live with sasuke. Aren't vampires and werewolves natural enemies? (unless you are going to make it differently in your story)<br>  <br>  I like the idea about her having to fake her own death though. Nice touch ^_^|`|SvVbZfjQaa	A really good story but i kinda reminded of the 'Twilight' series of course some details are changed. but altogether a good story with good names and characters.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it just plotline or u hav drawn some pages? if u hav dran it u can upload on sites like mangaupload n mangahelpers. Hope u complete the story and good luck with it.|`|iP5snolxaa	I love it, it sounds good! But be careful with the name Sasuke, it is named after a surpreme ninja in my japanese childhood stories, which is where Kishimoto got it for Naruto. The ninja in the story's full name was Sarutobi Sasuke.|`|zYvjljkNaa	sounds really good.<br>  cant wait to hear the ending<br>  the only thing is that she would have to be pretty stupid to tell haku to bit her :s<br>  <br>  love it though =D|`|SGIMCEoqaa	OMG THATS A GREAT IDEA! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT OR READ IT 5/5!!!!!!!!!|`|sLLQ1Msraa	sounds really interesting!

We haven't talked to each other in a month ( we/he/i was having an argument with each other, sort of, it'll make sense when you read on). I found out on Thursday that he thought I had a problem with him and hated him, while I was thinking the same thing about him. I talked to him on Friday and sorted it out. Neither of us had a problem and it all count/should have been sorted the minute it began a month ago!|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Once upon a time, my mother asked me turn the radio on, and tune in<br>  to the "Fine Music" station."

AA10053661	That perfect love....... where the connection is just so perfect that you can complete each other's thoughts...... heck you can even state them without the other person saying a word. In other words, you are so close and have such understanding of one another that you don't have to explain yourself. Best friends. <br>  <br>  So many relationships have people walking on egg shells worrying about saying this or that or wondering how he'll react of what she'll say. But that one relationship where you know how things will be and can anticipate their reaction because you know them so well...... ahhhhhhh............<br>  <br>  that is sooooo worth the wait!!!|`|GkH5NoFyaa	Everything you want in life.<br>  Write down everything you want.

OXleDYVQaa	Ever since I was old enough to understand, my Grand parents especially told me "A Lie is like digging a hole in dry sand"<br>  <br>  It constantly refills, the digging has to keep up, and at some point the one who is trying to do the digging loses, giving up.<br>  <br>  In my family Honesty is a Law, not a subjective choice.

When I was 10, I punched my aunt in the eye and called her a ******.  My grandmother asked me if I did it and I told her the truth.  She said I shouldn't do that again.  It was over.  Everyone moved on with minimal trauma and embarrassment and I didn't do it again.|`|AA10349169	lol, yes<br>  nope|`|T8OVFYrdaa	oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive|`|rjsfiWt9aa	Well i didn't get caught.

Somehow the doctor though i was lactosentolerant they made me take a blood test and i couldnt eat dairy for two weeks! All because i didnt want to go to school....|`|Tj2xROpwaa	yeah i have done that several times. but the most biggest lie was that i cheated on my boyfriend but 2 months later i told him because lying to him made me do really crazy destructive things like cutting and popping pills. luckily, he forgave me and that erased my pain plus being put on anti-depressants|`|F6YPGh9Raa	no, i don't lie..or i at least try not to, maybe white lies.....yet, when i lie i laugh.......so no....and yes it's always best to tell the truth, even if the truth hurts......omission is another story, if you don't say, and you aren't asked..then it's not a lie, however i still feel the same guilt!?|`|VA37zVPcaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I made it out and everything went ok.

AA12108244	You mean the film? Not really. It got mediocre reviews, so it's not rated highly to begin with. I thought it was underrated.|`|MwYc1YJCaa	It's overrated in the sense, because when it came out IT was a "graphic novel". So yes it was technically the big thing. But it was then overshadowed by the beginning of image comics and X-men generation 2 when Jim Lee took over..awesome comic books. I totally forgot about it because the characters really don't keep my attention.|`|N39N8PU9aa	I went and saw it with my boyfriend and had no idea or expectations of it. I liked it. It was a bit long, but I'm not complaining about it. I liked it. from all the garbage that came out in 2008 this was a real breath of fresh air.|`|738e2bd340747ab38ce7182b67f01999aa	The graphic novel had very deep material and it was probably really hard to put that all into one movie. The movie was pretty good, but it could have been a little better (I prefer the original ending). The graphic novel is brilliant. It is a must-read type of thing.|`|oGaGXondaa	The Comic or the Movie?<br>  <br>  The Comic, no way. That is the holy book of comics. The best.<br>  <br>  The Movie? I don't think so. Snyder injected his own style to the movie which actually fits nicely. The characters are also well done (except Ozy and maybe Silk Spectre I & II)<br>  <br>  The thing with Watchmen is...it's deep. you can't watch it once and think "Ok, this is overrated bs." It (even the movie) has layers that you need to uncover by watching or reading more than once.

6yMJbBuEaa	You can't find Dusk Stones in PokÃ©mon Colosseum because it's a Generation III game. Dusk Stones are only available in PokÃ©mon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. Dusk Stones weren't introduced until the Generation IV games.<br>  <br>  And Misdreavus evolves into Mismagius if you use a Dusk Stone on it, but only in Diamond, Pearl or Platinum. It won't evolve in any game made before those.|`|SGIMCEoqaa	you can't dusk stones are not in that game sorry :( i beat the game 4 years ago o.o.... it helps to have pokemon ruby or saphire and fr or gl  and a gamecube gba link so you can trade pokemon back anf forth. hope this helps

M62ZtzNqaa	the last time i walked into the Greenville T/A<br>  everyone knew my name too|`|9S6x6xZ9aa	December 12th, 1982 - the day I lost my virginity - <br>  <br>  She stood up, laughed & went home....|`|WjIqICg3aa	Right here buddy in 1980,,,,,,,,,,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmiFZH98_Lw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmiFZH98_...</a>|`|DS21ekeJaa	I never have.|`|W9IQYcjNaa	I can't recall a time when I have ever received a standing ovation... Well, if you count my kids, then I guess always.|`|bjzlgPWfaa	Never have that I can recall.|`|lLN8VD20aa	When Eleanor, my Elephant stopped <br>  an out of control car from crashing into a store.<br>  <br>  <br>  She wasn't that self-less you see .... she was <br>  just protecting her favorite Peanut Shop.<br>  <br>  But I bowed five times and took two curtain calls just the same|`|3j7WE8jGaa	I am not sure if I have *ever* actually received a "standing ovation".<br>  <br>  *thinking hard*<br>  <br>  But I think the last time I was on the receiving end of "applause" of any kind was during and after the last choral concert I performed in....which took place on November 30th, 2008. My *next* choral concert takes place a week from tomorrow....as I think I mentioned to you a while ago. Maybe we will bring the crowds to their feet on that occasion!!|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	Actually it was a few weeks ago.  This is true and kind of serious.  I have recently become a Buddhist.  I chant namyohorengekyo.  It gives me a peace of mind and more motivation amongst other things.  They asked me to give me experience that I have had in what it has done for me and I did.  After I was done they gave me a standing ovation.  It was really nice and amazing to have so much support for the bad times you've been through in life.|`|wC88aBxXaa	Ive searched the deepest ,darkest recess's of my mind and I come up with a blank so I guess the answer is never .|`|d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	Two nights ago :)|`|EOTH56DWaa	I farted in the break room. Everyone got up----& ran.
qe8dOJqGaa	First off, there is a huge difference between the "South" and here in South Florida -<br>  <br>  For example - <br>  <br>  In the "South" when you exchange pleasantries, people are genuinely nice... and sincere.<br>  <br>  In South Florida, if you try to exchange pleasantries, you are either going to get a stare like you have an open herpes sore, or you are going to get tasered. <br>  <br>  <br>  That said, I am one to exchange pleasantries in any situation, because I do, in fact, like people... <br>  <br>  And on the bright side, the scars from my last tasering are healing quite nicely|`|zamVDN8Aaa	I love being friendly with others. Sometimes it's a way to pick your self up along with making others feel happy that you spoke with them on a friendly note.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	Yes, I like Southern hospitality. That's why I love shopping at my local farmer's market. The people there are so friendly and its nice to get to know your neighboors.|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	Of course it does.  <br>  You have to stop and smell the roses, sometimes|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Here in Illinois we just say "fine".  And I'm fine with that.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	I just do it to be nice, I don't want to start a conversation.

oELW89mCaa	If a guy is 21 and still a virgin..... That's AWESOME!!! Tell this virgin that if he waits until marriage, the relationship will be stronger. I mean who would want a "used" husband/wife?|`|pD6K1rLkaa	that's actually a really good thing personally I think it's good to stay a virgin until you're married|`|nGu0sUJaaa	Hes maybe wierd OR is sticking to his guns and waiting for the right lady to come along and  i wish him the best of luck !!!|`|fKuvMPCiaa	He's inexperienced|`|AXXDyKecaa	is he waiting for the one or is he just not getting any??|`|IzgSw24jaa	yes|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	good for him....|`|c2fiGRfmaa	I think he is a virgin because he wants to be a virgin or because he doesn't care about what others think about he being a virgin.... what else could I think? Whoever thinks a person is a moron because " hes still a virgin at 21" is just a ....moron.  I think its childish to think that people are "made" off SEX. I still believe that other factors contribute a lot more to make a grown up than the age they first got   sex.|`|K75ILPtUaa	I think its great to see a young guy out there and still a virgin!! Too many guys these days just think about sex and not care where it comes from, sex should be something special shared between two people who love each other not just some cheap night out to get their rocks off!<br>  ~HUG~<br>  :)|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	He's either sticking to a decision, or just unlucky.|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	There's nothing wrong with that. Good for him. =]|`|INf502UUaa	He just hasn't found the one yet.|`|tLVZXLRSaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with him. I think its creepy when people lose it at like 15. And he's probably more thoughtful.|`|VR5dGg4taa	maybe he's the religious type?  savin' it for marriage...i can respect that...|`|rDmB2qIPaa	Theres nothing wrong with it.|`|8d5030c6f52153d3359a64e922eaffb5aa	I think he's pretty darn amazing.<br>  I hope, he keeps it up until marriage :D|`|B5fdh5oIaa	Either he is Jewish or he hasn't fine the right girl ! <br>  So simple!|`|AA11523465	Good for him.|`|ded2181b98ab4c89b217681e47f520ecaa	that's cool, nothing wrong with that! :)|`|8v3kQdtmaa	smart.

I try to "judge" whether someone is telling me the truth whether about a person, a product or an event. What is being prejudiced, but pre-judging, with the info you have on hand at the time? That can change with new information and you can then change your assessment.|`|nXktcA5Yaa	Honestly, yes I do, but most of the time I'm correct. I observe them for a while before I make conclusions, and I try to avoid the people that could possibly give me bad influences, and the people that do irresponsible things.|`|gknPGlDCaa	Yes. <br>  I avoid disabled people incase i offend them by accident <br>  i actually jusged one of my friends when i first met her because she was really pretty i thought she was a **** but shes not lol <br>  x|`|YgGi07Rpaa	all the time, and its something im not proud of...|`|5xLMogwDaa	yeah, i judge them to help me know them  better|`|JaSIm56Naa	sadly enough i think that we all do whether we try to or not

Bq8L7iT4aa	You have no idea. Salem's primary source of income is the tourist industry, which surges every October. There are tons of shops there specializing in wiccan/neopagan supplies. They have a psychic fair there in the mall. You see a lot of goths in town. but as Halloween approaches, the town gets INSANELY crowded with wiccans looking to celebrate Samhain there, so many that I like to call Salem during this time "Witchstock".|`|jU0dGPzUaa	I just saw that movie today on the Hallmark channel! (:<br>  Well, I was in Salem, Massachusetts last year around Halloween time. They got extremely into it. <br>  Did you know that year round, people wear capes and wear long peasent type dresses. They are called Wiccans. They are witches. :/<br>  It's kind of creepy how they are so into it. Haha. (:<br>  But I seriously love that movie. (:|`|yGp37iQWaa	who knows<br>  salem, mass. is where they had the majority of the witch trials in the 18th century<br>  <br>  and didn't the movie take place in Salem, oregon?|`|cd7n0knbaa	some do others don't they get into it on Halloween and dress up <br>  their is also A lot of witch history museums look it up on <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=364776" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|Aqs0UmVaaa	love the movie; but I don't know if people in Salem do.  Lately in my part of the world, seems like Halloween is slowly dying.  Stinks.|`|ygxM1Zkaaa	yes. you can see videos on youtube of it. it looks like martigras (however you spell).|`|N39N8PU9aa	idk. never been. the people in Sleepy Hollow Ny totally get into it!
ydKGJ7Nnaa	I always look at these types of things as scams.  Only because . . . if it worked so good why would they be sharing the information?  Why wouldn't he be buying all the properties and become a mega billionaire type tycoon  . . . instead of pitching a program to people looking to make a buck.|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	I say no..<br>  <br>  Note: there was a question before where someone made an apology to a Mike m.. is that you?|`|nGLL9oWqaa	Not misinterpreted as chatting? Dammit.

I made that mistake once and I will never get married again!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Took me twice to get it right but this time I have be married for 23 years.

OBwqjS8maa	You mean Norman Gentle/Nick Mitchell? I guess it was a long shot. That Adam guy was really good. Nick was one of my favorites though. He had a good voice and he was entertaining! Maybe he will get a wild card, but I doubt it. I think he'd have a good career as a singer/comedian. I'd pay to see him!|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	Because the voting is rigged. When the producers found out that Norman made it through they panicked and put through Kris Allen (Who?) instead.|`|AYlITDg9aa	Entertaining, but this show is not for him.|`|jKMWDZcaaa	He's overly dramatic in his performances. He doesn't have a horrible voice. Although, some who were eliminated leading up to the final 36 were better. He kept smiles on people faces. But, it's not a comedic talent show. It's a singing talent show. He just didn't put forth his singing ability as he should have if he really wanted to stay in the competition. Better luck next time!

Once you pray to make Jesus Christ Lord and Savior of your life, repent from your sins, and put your trust and faith in Christ, then you will know that God is real when you grow in your relationship with Christ.|`|bG1YxiwOaa	oh yeahhh|`|AA12213253	Yes, absolutely.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i believe that there is some sort of god but i don't believe in religion. i do believe that someone/thing created the universe i just don't no who.|`|HURcAIu2aa	I sure do!<br>  My life without Jesus or god SUCKS!<br>  I <3 Jesus, & God.|`|IHUS8wsbaa	yes<br>  my god is an awesome god<br>  Im a christian<br>  how about you??|`|pT514qPUaa	Yeah..<br>  Why not?

If yes to both, then its cheating.|`|VR5dGg4taa	when your yahoo avatar sleeps with another avatar...then it's cheating   :)|`|uRrLjFp9aa	i thinks its cheating|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, its very unfair to go on a dating site,if you have a partner.you would not like it,if he did it to you.if your boy friend is using them,or talking dirty on them,then if i was you, i would dump him.because it shows he has no respect for you.

They need to start with the average people first, then work their way up - they don't even know where most of the Wall Street & Big Bank money went, the auto makers want a bailout - why ? - so they can produce more cars that nobody can afford or get a loan for ? No, to pad the executives bank accounts. The whole thing is a mess and until they reach a real solution, I don't want to hear about it every single night on the news.|`|2qq3Ha30aa	Eco-buzzwords.

HPqqgtOSaa	She's just injured i've heard people saying that Kishimoto really likes the NaruHina pairing (not sure if it's true though) and she's like the top 5 most popular characters in Naruto. Oh and Itachi and Deidara weren't major characters and besides their villians (well Itachi isn't a villian actually) and villians have to die or the story can't progress provided if the bad guy turns good.<br>  <br>  Kakashi is far away from death one of Tsunade's slug is healing him. Well mabye Sakura might come in, take Hinata away from the battle scene cause 6-tailed Naruto can get really nasty and heal her.|`|X45rxI7gaa	I certainly hope so, I thought finally Kishimoto responded to fan request to make her and Naruto get together. But then he 'presumably' kills her off. I doubt she's dead but he was really shocked when she confessed.|`|AA10836670	she was only knocked unconcious from the looks of it.<br>  <br>  i dont know if its gonna happen. mostly because naruto has never thought of her that way. he has always seen her as the weird girl.<br>  <br>  they are complete oposites but i think after the event, hinata will be more open/not so afraid to appraoch naruto, maybe even other boys.|`|BtcJHbILaa	She's not dead at all as many pointed out, probably just unconscious.<br>  <br>  Remember in the beginning of the series, against Zabuza they thought Sasuke was dead, but he came out of it. Same thing here. The creators had already put these two together, in Naruto and Naruto Ship, Naruto makes strange comments towards her, which kinda say they will be together in the future.<br>  <br>  At one point he says, Hinata youre the one i want, in the other he says shut up and come with me etc etc.<br>  <br>  She wont die. They will be together.|`|L2nbez3caa	Nah.. i dont think hinata is dead. Kishi just jeeded her to trigger the kayubi inside naruto. But definitely she wont die. And besides i've seen photos of them. Kissing and stuff. So they will end up together.<br>  <br>  And if hinata die's, im not gonna forgive kishi for doing that to her. I mean Hinata is 1 of the favorites. How could he kill her, and do something like that. And if hinata dies, im pretty sure naruto manga and the anime naruto will loose ranks.<br>  <br>  Naruto manga and Naruto shippuuden is in the A1 right now, which is the top.<br>  <br>  And kishi is getting ideas from us. He's actually reading our predictions to create some imaginations. And if people dont hinata dead, then i guess hinata is alive. We should all think outside the box sometimes.<br>  <br>  SO COME ON KISHI!

I have however, had some  small desires/dreams broken, when i'm dreaming at night, if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  I only have little dreams, only little hopes, we should learn to be greatful for what we have already. We should give love and respect to others, and not expect anything in return in what we do, and if we are we should expect the bad outcome (not saying you should be pessimistic, just don't expect i mean, spread the smile and move on ;) ), because when its good outcome, we are happy, if not, then we were ready for it (this is what i feel & do. These are all just my oppinions) we should also love and live every moment & be happy, because life is too short to be sad for too long & to be living with regrets. Forgive, forget and learn from mistakes.

hJP9y6kjaa	Okay so you're using the combo? I haven't played it personally, but lemme tell you, I have the head version, I'm playing through a 2x12 cab, and I sound *killer*. I'm also using a Metal Zone and a GT-3 multifx processor, so I can get a pretty wide variety of tones.<br>  <br>  So what's the tone you're looking for? If you want a heavy distorted tone, you're going about it the wrong way... the blues driver is not known as a good pedal for chunky rock distortion!<br>  <br>  Here's what I want you to do - take your guitar and blues driver pedal and go to a store that has a variety of different amps to play with. Find a Blackheart or Fender amp, since they're both going to have pretty clear sounds to them. Now try your guitar + pedal. Still sound like crap? Then it isn't the amp! Then try out a pedal that's going to match the tone you want... if you want aggressive distortion, then go for the Metal Zone, Metalcore, Metal Muff, or MXR Distortion+... well, there's tons of good pedals for distortion, but those are a good place to start. If you want more "punk" style, you could try the DS-1 or Big Muff for more alt/indie sounds (think Bush), etc.<br>  <br>  If you still sound like crap, then try playing through other guitars - if the tone magically improves, then it's your pickups that need the upgrade.<br>  <br>  In general the best way to improve your tone is to get a better amp and/or better speakers. Since you're using a combo amp, the two are connected, but you still might want to start pricing other amps. The Marshall MG is a great line of amps, for instance - for being solid state they have some great tones, especially for that price point.<br>  <br>  Along with that, though, you need to have equipment that suits your tone. The best way to do that is to experiment with different guitar/pedal/amp setups... even ones that you might not be able to afford right now, that will give you an idea what to shoot for (or what to save up for!).<br>  <br>  So I've covered getting proper pedals and upgrading your amp. Only after those two actions should you consider upgrading your pickups. Remember, a 2000$ guitar will still sound like poo when played through a 100$ amp!<br>  <br>  Your pickup selection will depend on what you want, tonewise. Want a hot, chunky distorted tone? Sure, EMGs are one way to go, but Seymour Duncan Blackouts are another (and have more bass and treble than EMGs to boot). Hell, even Dragonfire Actives are another way to go, too... I just got a pair of those and I'm very happy with them, at least for my "rock/metal" guitar. Not quite as good a tone as the Blackouts, but at about half the price, I figured they were worth it.  =)<br>  <br>  I've got another guitar with Seymour Duncans in it - an Alnico II Pro in the neck and an Alternative 8 in the bridge, and my god does it have a great set of tones.... from "Slash"-y leads to a deep distorted chunk to very acceptable coil-taps, doesn't get muddy even with high levels of gain, and lots of picking dynamics for a very organic tone.... I like having a high-output bridge pickup and low-output neck pickup - they tend to balance, volume-wise, a lot more naturally, and you get the best of both worlds - great distortion and soulful lead/clean tones.<br>  <br>  So yeah, basically what I'm saying is try a different pedal first (since that's the cheapest potential fix). Then start looking at different amps, and see if your amp really isn't going to work for you. Only at that point would I start looking at swapping out the pickups.<br>  <br>  BTW, most of the usable volume in an amp is in the first 10 watts. A 10 watt amp is twice as loud as a 1 watt amp, and a 100 watt amp is still only twice as loud as a 10 watt amp... that means that a 5 watt amp is half as loud as a 50 watt amp.... and when you consider that most of the time you aren't trying to crank it to max volume anyways, that's really not such a bad thing.<br>  <br>  The volume you perceive depends directly on the quality/size/number of the speakers.... wattage tends to be more of a measurement of headroom rather than volume for all intents and purposes. What that means is that more headroom = you can play clean notes at louder volumes. That also means that you have to turn it up louder to get that "cranked" sound.... so low wattage isn't such a bad thing, after all.<br>  <br>  This mostly applies to tube amps. Tube amps distort in a musical fashion (unlike solid state, which starts to sound really crappy when you push 'em hard), so they effectively end up sounding louder vs their solid state counterparts. 1 tube watt = 1.5 to 2 solid state watts, in other words. <br>  <br>  Hope some of this has helped.. if you want more advice, or have specific questions, feel free to email me. I'm working on getting sound clips ready, so hopefully at some point I'll be able to demonstrate why I'm so happy with my setup. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|rC9kyGGfaa	id say get humbuckers they help they sound nice but gettign a better sounding amp helps alot u have no idea line 6 has ok tone and sounds but new pick up help ALOT|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Of course pick ups would help some, probably not as much as a new amp though.<br>  It depends on what pickups are in there right now. If you are going to go with new pickups I reccomend Seymour Duncan APH-1 Alnico II Pro Humbuckers. I put those in my Les Paul and they sound good with it.<br>  What pickups do you currently have? What amp do you have?<br>  Having that information would help with deciding which would most likely make a bigger difference in sound.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Ooh, 5 watt amp. I would definitely upgrade that personally, to atleast a 15 watt. The pickups I reccomended are about $80 each and it would need two of them, so for now, $160 could be spent a lot better on an amp in my opinion.|`|wYAgw73Naa	Some pickups can not handle the gain or distortion of the amp you are using. If you put new pickups you should definitely get EMGs because they handle amps the best, unless you play with a cleaner sound. amps make the greatest difference in sounds though. get a new amp and then  new pickups.

I drove one of their models in the 80K range and boy could it accelerate!<br>  <br>  But since I'm practical, I go for the BMW's all-included service - just sell it before their coverage ends.  They want $1500.00 to repair a radio that works...the button won't depress to turn it off.  And $1500 to fix a radio button is CRAZY.  And they depreciate like crazy (might have something to do with their exorbitant repair costs....).  We're talkin' buy at around 55K, keep it pretty, clean and well-maintained, and they'll give you 16K after just 3 years.  Sure, they'll sell it for 28-29, but 16 is all that the owner gets.  <br>  <br>  I really like silver.

Good luck and ENJOY YOUR FREEEEEEEDOMMMMMMM|`|FND7XWLxaa	Im guessing you are a freshman or sophomore in high school...<br>  If this is the case... break up with him... not only does this relationship probably not matter that much in the grand scheme of you life, people will forget about it and stop talking about it in a month.. or after you're spring break.<br>  <br>  Or you can just ask him where he thinks the relationship is going to be sure.<br>  But if he is a dick to you dump him right now|`|0floKHTIaa	ughh. mixed signals. those are the worst.<br>  i hated that.<br>  the only thing you should do is go somewhere with him alone. sit down and talk. tell him the way you feel. and listen to him. also remember this is not to start an argument its to figure out what your next move needs to be. :)<br>  <br>  hope i could help--|`|gRXH3tpgaa	I think that you should wait a while or talk to him about.|`|ZxT7s5SQaa	LET HIM  GO    HE IS CHEATING ON YOU    DO NOT FALL  FOR IT    COME  TAKE ME   OVER  HIM|`|FHmO5DZRaa	I think you should break up with him.

There's lots of other boys in the world. I wish you luck!|`|Fn6vayT4aa	dont break up with him then since your not sure what you want then tell him you would like  break and on your brea give yourself time to think it over and see if he changes how he acts towards you see if he treats you better|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	Talk to him about it. Tell him you are confused about the way he's been acting. And then, if he has no explanation, break up with him.|`|SuMwWNfyaa	um.<br>  <br>  <br>  Does anyone really care?|`|f8epBxFOaa	you sound very young if hes a jerk dump him and find someone else the last thing you need is to deal with stuff like that when your young you should be having fun. and who cares what everyone says they can date him if they care so much !|`|eC8QfE9Naa	Talk to him about it. If it's really not working out, then maybe you guys will be able to both agree on breaking up, because that's what's best for both of you. That's better than dumping each other and less painful too.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Sure.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Who needs the head games?  Just end it for now.

Move on.|`|zlQLsR89aa	If you truley love him, dont but if you dont feel very comfortable with him its time to let him go.

Love something enough to give it away, if it comes back then it never left youl|`|dzukCeGhaa	Well, If he really feels like you guys need to break up...<br>  he'll break up with you first.|`|ZaMiyEv8aa	It seems like you already know the answer but are hesitant to do something about it.  If you are asking yourself if you should be with him or not more than likely the relationship is a waste of both of your times.  Best way to handle it honestly is to talk to him about it and be strait forward don't beat around the bush.....and don't worry about what other people think, its your life.|`|LgGeTaBLaa	it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks, its your life and you have to live with it, not them........so i believe that maybe u should wait it out a bit and see. things may get better. if they don't, then you should break up with him. wait and see, if you really really feel like u should break up with him right now then do it. good luck|`|VkXQq2y2aa	break up with him. if theres problems now, there will be more problems later.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Just talk to him, girl! Tell him 'Do u want to break up? Cuz i feel like u r sending me mixed signals. Like you want to break up, then u dont".  if he has a reasonable answer that u except dont, but if u dont like his answer, break it off. <br>   but more importantly, do what ur heart says.<br>  Hope i helped!! :D|`|ru5qKN4eaa	I don't know... it seems like, if you're so guilty over it, you shouldn't.  I would have ti hear more to give a good answer.  What does he do that bothers you?  If he chews with him mouth open, it's not worth breaking up, but if he cheats on you, dump him.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Go ask your mommy little girl.|`|egKG5Gwbaa	you should break up with him then. If he is purposely breaking up with you on purpose than it means he doesn't like you anymore.

If your not loving your relationship with him then there is no point in staying in it. Who cares what everyone else thinks, its what you want|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	If you're contemplating it then obviously you should just move on.|`|hcKoFZ3Daa	Tell him straight on, stop the mix signals and be a good boyfriend or its over.

BGIxDWkZaa	This is the problem I have with most rap. Not enough music, i.e. instruments. Which is strange because a lot of them have huge bands they take on tour.<br>  <br>  Most of it reflects a lifestyle I cannot relate to. I cannot see how singing/rapping about killing people, pimping girls, selling and using drugs. I just don't get it. <br>  <br>  Then there is the almost mindless rhyming of one swear after another. Seems if you can smoke a lot of dope, and rhyme f*ck with f*ck you too can be a hip hop star. Again I don't get it.<br>  <br>  There does not seem to be a lot of intellect that goes into the actual lyrics. I kinda like Eminem for that reason. At least he can produce poly syllabic words. There seems to be a real attempt to actually tell a story via song.<br>  <br>  The other thing that really bugs me about the whole genre, is how so many people that really are the dregs of society are idolized. How they make stars out of people you really wouldn't want to be friends with. By and large.<br>  <br>  Then take Will Smith for example. His music is not "black" enough to be played in most urban stations. Come on.<br>  <br>  I do not think it's all mindless garbage. Just a lot of it. Then again how many kids picked up guitars in the 60s and attempted to be The Beatles. <br>  <br>  Every generation has it's own music. There were hundreds of guys that tried to follow in Frank Sinatra's footsteps. How many of them can you think of today.<br>  <br>  Same could be said about The Beatles, The Stones. How may of their contemporaries are remembered today?<br>  <br>  There are going to be some that will go on to be the cream of the crop. Hundreds more are going to be simply footnotes in popular music. If they rank that high. Most will be forgotten completely.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Morning Tambo!<br>  <br>  You know I love hip hop!<br>  <br>  But I think most people that do not do as you said and use the same old tired excusses of how it is not music it is to violent and so forth only say that cuz they have never really listened to hip hop. Or should I say real hip hop. It is hard to say the stuff you hear on the radio is real hip hop cuz we know it is not. By no means is soulja boy and his stupid dances hip hop. Lolli pop is not hip hop...Etc...<br>  <br>  I work in a very upscale office of which I am the only person of color I always have some music playing from my computer. The owners son came to my desk for some paperwork and the Black Album was playing. What More Can I Say Started to play and he knew the first few bars of the opening verse...I said boy do I play this that much that you know the words, he then tells me he has the grey album but really only likes that song cuz of the beat used on the grey album for it. I asked did you ever sit down and listen to the lyrics? He said no why would I it is just a song about some drug dealer :( I told him that was not what that song was about and he should give it a listen print out the lyrics and follow along. I doubt he ever did! <br>  <br>  I am also a very big fan of rock music which was hard due the fact I grew up in the "ghetto" and nobody listened to that "kind" of music. I was often called the darkest white girl in the projects cuz I would have hip hop on side A of the tape and rock on side B (yeah back in the day we used tapes LOL) <br>  <br>  My point is until you listen to the music and fully understand the words being said you can never make or pass judgement on a genre of music!<br>  <br>  You Know How We Do Sweetie!!!!|`|AA11166769	I hate rap, not because I don't think it's a form of music, but simply because I don't like the way it sounds. There's nothing about it that speaks to me. This isn't a criticism of those who do like rap, but rather a statement of opinion.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	There isn't one.  I like Rap & Hip Hop as well.  I love Lupe Fiasco, De La Soul, Aesop Rock, and Busdriver.<br>  <br>  **Great answer Prof.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	I totally agree... there are IMO some very bad hip hop which is just trendy and crap which is most of the hip-hop in the mainstream.. but you know what, most of the worst rock bands are mainstream as well.. like Nickelback.  I have found very amazing Rap and hip-hop artist over the year, and it is not just old school stuff like The Sugarhill gang, Public Enemy, and what not.. there are amazing Rap artist today, who are not just making Bass junkie garbage like Lil John and that crap.  Such as The Roots (Who play their own instruments), Aesop Rock, Jedi Mind Tricks, Blackalicious, and many others who push alot of musical boundries, and the music is also very good... but not what someone who say.. listens to only ACDC, Led Zeppelin and whatnot would really listen too.  Almost every genre has its bad music (IMO) and every genre has its great artist... hip-hop is no exception.<br>  <br>  The notion that Rap is not music because it does not have a melody, nor does it have any harmonies is false... Death Metal is considered by many to be one of the hardest forms of music to play, and there is no melodic structures...  unless of course its "Melodic" Death metal... nor does Punk have any basic Melodic structures, but is still considered music.<br>  <br>  Many rap does include melody...<br>  <br>  EXAMPLE <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6ZU9ZKGjEc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6ZU9ZKGj...</a>|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I don't consider it music really.<br>  <br>  There used to be some great hip hop guys out there who wrote genuine lyrics with meaning, but anymore, I honestly don't see it.  I know a lot of people say that the only things hip hop is about are women, drugs, violence, etc, but that isn't really what I'm saying.  Hip hop used to have great songs with a purpose behind them, but I don't hear it anymore.<br>  <br>  The main reason I don't consider it music, is because there really aren't instrumentals in the songs.  A lot of the beats are samples of other songs, with no actual band playing behind the front man, and that isn't music to me.  When I hear the word music, I picture a guitarist, drummer, singer, and maybe a bass guy, not just one person.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	I've formulated several answers, and deleted them all. I'm going to try and keep it simple this time around - I don't need to throw out pages.<br>  <br>  In every genre the most popular artists are not the ones who are intelligent and thought-provoking, but the ones that cater to the lowest common denominator - our basest instincts, if you will.<br>  <br>  How many Top 40 pop songs are about sex and love? How many rap songs are about greed (ie personal wealth), lust/sex, violence, etc? How many rock songs are about "rocking out", partying, sex, etc?<br>  <br>  If you listen to rap on the radio (which is the de facto definition of what is the most popular) you won't hear any Aesop Fable or KRS-One or any of the other artists people have listed. You won't hear any of the "10 MC's... who don't fit that category". Any of them.<br>  <br>  My argument isn't with any specific genre, really, it's with the culture that promotes artists with nothing to say over those who actually have substance and talent. It's with a culture that prefers mindless entertainment to education and a sense of higher purpose.<br>  <br>  (I'm not referring in any way to christian music, btw. Christian music is hell-bent, if you will, on evangelizing to the "unsaved" and reinforcing a culture that values intolerance to others and blind obedience to free thought and a willingness to value other people's worldviews)<br>  <br>  There is a place for "fun" music. My beef is when that is the only thing that is valued, and there is no balance.<br>  <br>  There is no balance in rap. How do you become really famous in rap? You get promoted, and that happens on your "rep", your "street cred", and let's not forget your "image". Wear the right clothes, say the right things, walk a certain way, and you're in. Don't, and you're relegated to the sidelines, at best.<br>  <br>  So are there MCs who create intelligent music? Sure. But there's a lot more that don't, and your *average rap fan* doesn't seem to really care about the ones who do.<br>  <br>  I'm willing to listen to some rap, but I don't want to waste my time with lowest common denominator music. I don't want to dance - I want to think, I want to feel, I want to connect, I want to be validated in my search for a deeper meaning and a higher purpose in life.<br>  <br>  I know I'm in the minority, though, because Soulja Boy has sold millions of records.<br>  <br>  So if there are good rap artists out there, sure, I'll listen. No problem. But the culture that promotes sex, drugs, gun violence, and material possessions over intelligence and deeper meaning?<br>  <br>  No thanks, I'll pass... but the problem is at the heart of humanity, not in some stupid music trend. Rap is essentially worthless to me, but not for its musical merits (or lack thereof).... but how it is less of a method of transformation than a device for the callous few to sell abusive fantasies to the many incapable of telling truth from an entertaining fiction.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Punk has some of the most basic "melodic foundations" that can be found in music.... I-IV-V, I-V-vi-IV, etc. Are there melodies in rap? Sure, sometimes. Again, I defer to popular opinion - Soulja Boy? Seriously?<br>  <br>  Is there crappy music in every genre? Absolutely. I just think there's more of it in rap, because the minimum requirements are so low - dress in trendy clothes, and learn to rhyme. You don't have to make your voice an instrument, you can buy beats from someone else, so what's left? Your mind, that's what. And how many of them actually *use* it in any meaningful way?<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|htxwTAAQaa	It depends on what it is.  Of course there's stuff that is garbage and called hip-hop but actually isn't (Yin Yang Twins, Lil Wayne, etc) but then there are timeless records from artists like Wu-Tang, Nas, Biggie, etc.  I don't classify myself as a hip hop fan, but I like a lot of it.  There's some good stuff out there.|`|qkCFLgaSaa	because they don't sing they don't play instruments they rhyme words and who seriously is gonna take a guy with a CLOCK around his neck seriously as an artist... however notorious big had something, i will admit that he brought something where he rapped about a story alot of the time and it was different and cool for its time  but this "thug life" "bithces and hoes" will never be music|`|0fygxRHLaa	cuz they ain't sangin!|`|L86QJXzEaa	I don't really see how you can argue against a genre.<br>  So I won't.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	You are on the wrong web site for " intelligent debate ".|`|9F6hdc3waa	it reli is a bad influence 4 kids . . . i like it tho|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i actually like some rap and hip hop, but i do have a criticism of it: hip hop doesn't know its own roots. There is too much hip hop that sample james brown and if you ask them about james brown they wont even know their DJ put it in the song. Too many people who don't know who Gil Scott Heron is or who the Last Poets were and it shows with too many uninspired regurgitations of pop songs ala puff daddy. Too many people who dont know who lee scratch perry was or what dub is or what toasting was. Too many people who dont know who langston hughes was. There is some hip hop and rap that i love, but if it overall wants to be taken seriously as a genre, and not just dismissed as lazily produced club music that piggiebacks other artists, it is time to take itself seriously.<br>   <br>  the groups that do take the history of their music seriously, that take themselves seriously, like the roots, de la soul, the digible planets, gang starr, immortal technique- groups like that you can feel the difference- it is integrity that too much hip hop doesnt have.<br>  <br>  edit- lmao @ MCG- i could go for some tea and buns about now|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I would like to oppose the argument made by Sax Player (completely respectfully of course). There is melody and often harmony in hip hop. Look at a group like Jurassic 5. They rap around a melody and harmonize. Melody is usually acheived in hip hop. Listen to some hip hop side by side with spoken word. You will find consistencies in tone (pitch) and cadence. Sure there are variances too, but there are melodic variances in rock music too. Hip hop does have melody.<br>  <br>  As for instruments. First off, is the keyboard not an instrument? Is electronic music not music? They can both be equally bare bones instrumentally and still successful within their genre. A lot of keys and samples. Plus, many acts do use guitars, live drums, etc, at least in the studio. It's just that there is a charm in hip hop to the sound of records and how they convey the instruments. It's not always done that way though. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to say that I know a ton about hip hop, but it's definitely music. As for the singing argument. I think when you've heard enough people rap poorly trying to prove how anyone can do it, or just being silly, it's pretty easy to see that it's its own skill set. Much like singing.<br>  <br>  Thanks a lot Jake. I appreciate that. I've been meaning to have a look at Lupe Fiasco by the way. Thanks for reminding me of that.|`|upfY1A9iaa	I don't think that anyone can make a reasonable argument against hip hop not being music because hip hop music has influence multiple different genres of music and if it wasn't for it some great bands now would cease to exist.|`|c5HPLiRfaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/rannveigangelsweet" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/rannveigangelswee...</a><br>  <br>  Get someone who speaks icelandic and have them translate it for you, I don't believe what rannveigangelsweet says but this is the best I can find.|`|Grb85RJuaa	I don't like rap music because I think all of it sounds terrible.  I'm also embarrassed to be around other people who are listening to it because I feel like if someone thinks I like rap they will think I'm stupid.  Rap is that bad.|`|CJop46QXaa	I think people do not consider rap to be music because the music used in the rap songs comes from the computer(most of the time) and therefore no real instruments no real music.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	I like hip hop.  Especially that song "Hell Yeah (Pimp The System)" by Dead Prez.  It sets a really good example.  :P|`|BqQAcmVbaa	anybody can talk but it takes talent to hit the notes axle rose can hit|`|31cf2a3995a7e000ff27474f546fb219aa	hey, music is whatever you want it to be. some people considered what yoko ono did as music. i never got it.|`|UjC2vaqLaa	No|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	Rappers hardly use instruments,instead choosing to steal I mean 'sample' real musicans music.They can't even sing.<br>  If you don't sing and you don't play an instrument you're not a musican.<br>  It's that simple.Hip-Hop is third rate poetry over stolen music and drum machines and rap is just a bunch of ex-cons talking about guns,calling women hoes,and things like that.<br>  It's not music even if you like it.<br>  I'm just not hearing anything that sounds like music when I listen to rap.It's just guys talking over stolen beats and even the ones that aren't stolen are just made on a computer,in 1970 if you would've went to a record label with a tape of yourself rhyming stuff over a Beatles records what do you think people would've thought of that?<br>  And 'real' hip-hop.Don't make me laugh.It's even worse than this money,hoes,and guns non sense.At least some of those guys have charisma.The real hip-hop artists just read a poem over some stolen soul song while useing no personallity what so ever.|`|anqIOoQ1aa	First of all, I won't say that hip hop and rap isn't music.  But here is the argument:  The basic elements of music are melody, harmony, rhythm, form, texture, etc.  If there is no melody (or harmony), then a huge, very basic element is missing.  Talking is not melody, since there are no pitches or notes.  It is just rhythmic speaking.  Most  music has a melody, something that is "singable."  Without that, some people don't consider it music. That has nothing to do with generational differences. My opinion?  It IS music, but very simplistic and that is why it doesn't appeal to me.  I find talking over a beat, or someone else's prerecorded music pretty boring.|`|lmwVR1BGaa	listen son ,i would love to force you to listen to Perry Como,that would soon put that hip rap business out of you.where has all the good music gone?people like mc hammer+vanilla icicles are a bad influence on the kiddies.Fcuk The Police should be Love the Police and Gin an Juice should be Tea and Buns.i pray for you........................

The dress is enough to be a head-turner! <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|uRrLjFp9aa	3rd one with spangly silver scarf and silverbracelet|`|5Zcq3LXOaa	2nd one|`|kcOS8ZSpaa	The second one is really pretty :P|`|TepKLuP7aa	The third one! it is beautiful! :)|`|jb0MLVMuaa	i really like the second one|`|KHL4N6mtaa	the third one is a really cute dress & looks nice on you (:<br>  <br>  the heels you're wearing are pretty too !|`|e7c28740060350d2f181d79ca9b56dffaa	3rd|`|27YcxShoaa	3 hands down! if i were to choose <br>  a 2nd place one it would be #2 tho..<br>  <br>  =]<br>  gold accessories will go great with the 3rd one.<br>  and as for your hair you hair looks short<br>  but try curling it and see how<br>  it looks =]|`|XTWClFLQaa	I really like the 3d one, very cute!|`|xNYUZZvlaa	The third one.

I had no idea that all these belonge in this specific category called anime, or that they were japanese but as a kid i liked them a lot. In greek, of course they were really different (for instance, cardcaptor sakura was named Nikki) When I was 13 I discovered what anime really is, and I really love them since.|`|hfJE1BhMaa	I first got obsessed with Anime when I was little and watched Dragon Ball, when goku was still little and then I expanded and found out about other anime and that they were actually manga so since I was little and right now im OVERLY obsessed with Naruto. =P<br>  ....And Death Note.|`|oamZeAhhaa	I was bored , cos i had nothing to do. i watched Dragon ball 3, then Naruto and i got totally absorbed since then.<br>  <a href="http://www.naruto-network.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naruto-network.net/</a>|`|ZRGkOB7oaa	Had to be my freshmen year of high school, i was about 14-15.

Of course, the first one I really ever watched was Naruto, but I've been watching a lot more(Vampire Knight, Kuroshitsuji,Bleach, Rurouni Kenshin, Deathnote, Dragonball Z, Inyuyasha, etc) and I read manga scans online.

ae8LocIuaa	you could do a story board you put pictures and then captions <br>  try that:)|`|pFsSm4n6aa	You will need to draw up a storyboard and a screenplay. =] x|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I'm in a similar situation. I'm looking for free formatting software. I know that some script readers won't even open it if it's not set out correctly.|`|tLeonixWaa	You don't need a storyboard!  That's what is created when a film goes into production so you can visualise what the finished film will LOOK like.  At the moment you haven't even written the damn thing.<br>  <br>  The simple answer is just write it!  You don't need any fancy software to do it, just do it.   The kind of people who spend ages searching for the perfect software to write with are the people who will never ever suceed; the people who scribble it down on a notepad because they just want to write are the people who do.<br>  <br>  (If you do want to get an idea of how to lay out a script, try the BBC's free Word plugin, Scriptsmart:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scriptsmart/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts...</a><br>  )<br>  <br>  Of course, the most important thing is you need to know the beginning, middle and end of your screenplay before you start writing.  Write your entire idea down as a few short paragraphs so you at least know the structure of the movie.  <br>  <br>  Most movies follow a simple three act structure<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/pruter/film/threeact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/pruter...</a><br>  <br>  work out how your idea fits into this structure then get writing!|`|N39N8PU9aa	its called a story board. it basically gives all of the workers in the film a visual idea of how the film is going to progress. its utilized by the sound guy to the editor in the cutting room. you basicaly draw the frame out how it looks in your head and write a line that occours from when it happens :D try googling it|`|8IszwwJJaa	you have to do is a storyboard or else your movie might not come out the way you like it. if you do a storyboard it will be easier for you to make it TRUST ME IVE done it it helps a lot i hope i helped

It has a great cast with Elizabeth Banks and Michelle Williams and Michael Showalter and Justin Theroux. Michelle Williams' character "Cecil" just lights up the screen scene after scene.<br>  <br>  Another good choice is the movie "Reuben, Reuben" with Tom Conti and Kelly McGillis.

Klb4ZYcVaa	Yes, go see it, see what really happens down there in India. It's very heartbreaking, but watch it. & people who didn't like the film is probably b/c they were sick of the hype. Well, this film deserves the hype & every single Oscar they won.|`|H7L66ynJaa	If it is not your scene do not go. No amount of hype will make you accept what is unacceptable to you.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	I heard that there is 2 many things going on through out the film!|`|iU1ULFWVaa	I have seen it three times, it is one of the best films I have ever seen. I went once with my boss, then had to take my brother/mother, and husband. All with very different views on movies, all loved it! The cinematography is beautiful, there is action, (a little violence) comedy, even a love story. Any one who truly loves films and has some sort of an attention span would love this movie. It is so well done, and deserved every award it won! Go see it, you WILL NOT be disappointed!|`|OuTlT8f6aa	It's not gruesome it's just very gritty and real.<br>  There are some bad parts of the film but this is the reality of the situation they're in. <br>  I thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen and please don't let the darker side of the film put you off<br>  It's Awesome!!!|`|6oWIKqS7aa	the beginning is the torture scene. it's horrible. i think just that tho.<br>  all in all, it's good. since i like danny boyle, i saw it, just different kinda film. tell the truth, because of this beginning, i didn't like it as much... besides, am not  big fun of bollywood... i mean, it's not bollywood but you know, a bit similar... in a way|`|641ef355c3ba077004c47f9ce2106922aa	Go and see it. I hate horrors or any kinds of violence in films too, but saw it yesterday and loved it. There are only two really violent moments, both really short and not all that terrible at all. The film is not gruesome, the characters are strong and there is a happy ending. It's actually a bit of a gangster movie if you look at it properly. <br>  Cover your eyes for the two scenes, and you will love it.|`|VYJH0pAoaa	No not at all <br>  the movie is very exciting. You will feel entertained throughout the movie.<br>  <br>  I hate horror movies too, so that makes two of us. I just don't get how people can be entertaind by horror movies.<br>  <br>  But believe me this movie is one of a kind. To be specific, there is no horrific or gross stuff at all for me. but if you're too sensitive there is a 2 minute part where a guy burns the child's eyes so he becomes blind, but they don't show that disgusting part just a spoon coming closer to his face(no zooms) and the other child freaks out there's no screaming or stuff it just happened swiftly.<br>  <br>  In my opponion go see the movie now don't waste it for a 2 minute part of the movie.|`|1RrFvHJxaa	Well having been to see it twice I think yes, you should definitely go see it. Yes, there are some gruesome bits (I hate things like that too) but you know when they are going to happen.. music, tension etc.. so there is plenty of time to cover your eyes, as I did.<br>  Hope you do go see it and really enjoy yourself.<br>  :)|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I have not seen it, but I have a friend who goes to see everything.<br>  <br>  He said it actually was NOT that great.  Go figure.|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	well i went to see it and the only bit i enjoyed was the end i was suprised it won 8 oscars|`|RNnqh8f4aa	Yeah you should go watch it, it'll be worth your time.|`|QroCDTR6aa	IT IS AMAZING! and very moving|`|70At0HClaa	i dunno shud you?|`|XX0ac9iRaa	It's a really good film, you should definitely go and see it! It's really feel good and happy, even though bad stuff happens throughout the film it's always very exuberant and full of energy, and the ending makes up for the suffering in the film. <br>  As for violence... there's nothing particularly gorey, it's mostly implied violence. I wouldn't describe it as gruesome, more as gritty... you mostly don't see any blood or anything unnecessary. It's more truthful than anything... if you can handle watching news shows about warzones or disasters (not that there are either in the film) you can probably handle this.I personally didn't find it too bad at all and was quite surprised to see it was a 15.|`|RmZbkrmMaa	yes you should see it!! it's really really good. There are a few parts (I won't spoil it) - only things I'll say is.. at the start when they're asking the questions you might wanna look away (not gruesome, just.. ew) then there's a part with lots of men with sticks. that's kinda scary. apart from that it is AMAZING!! go see go see!!|`|hRSRy90qaa	I have been to see it and I thought it was a great film. I went with a few friends and couple of them found it boring. I wouldn't say it's very gruesome, there is a bit of torture but no blood and gore.|`|PJVG9BRaaa	it was a great film i had a message that not matter were u come from good things can happen and the is nothing horrible in it|`|asgRcQTLaa	obviously !!! first of all its indian...so its gonna rock...plus its won 8 oscars....its an awesome movie....dev patel and freida pinto totally rockk........go figure it !!!|`|crNLNutEaa	its a must watch movie ...but if u dont have a strong heart ...then leave it|`|tGYFKuWwaa	Definally go and see it!|`|4SRrWBVZaa	My friend said it no good but that their opinion I not really that taken by the film and so have no interest to see it x|`|i94bMKbkaa	I suggest not to go.

However, you can go to twitterfall.com/phish where some people at the show post what songs Phish is playing in real time. That's what I did for about 5 hours last night.

2WQge5Eqaa	Miley is my personal hero. Is she perfect? No. But is she human? Yes. All humans make mistakes. She addresses those mistakes also and doesn't try to cover them up like so many celebrities do. She's easy to relate to because she doesn't try to act perfect, and she's not afraid to make mistakes. Miley has to deal with so much from hate from teenagers & parents to the stress of her job. I personally think she's doing a pretty good job because of all that she has to handle. And NO ONE should judge her because no one knows what its like to be a celebrity, and what she has to endure.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	PURE TALENT!|`|OLl5Zc6baa	shes cool|`|jH9iRq2Uaa	i dislike her because:<br>  <br>  1. she has not talent<br>  2. shes a horrible role model<br>  3. she dressed 2 skanky 4 her age wen she was 14<br>  4. shes racist to asians<br>  5. she posed  naked 4 vanity fair<br>  6. she makes fun of the demi and selena show on youtube cuz shes jealous<br>  7. she post inapropriate pics of herself on the internet 4 fun<br>  8. SHE IS SOOO ANNOYING<br>  9. theres like 50 q's about her on yahoo everyday<br>  10. her songs are dumb|`|03GNhNcsaa	she was a good girl.<br>  but now she's a bad influence to every little girl across the WORLD.<br>  <br>  that's it. i don't need to go into details. do i?|`|8v3kQdtmaa	i like her because her show is funny<br>  and she has a gr8 singing voice|`|iJbslaQNaa	dont have any comments about her|`|M9EcpbmDaa	fairly recently iv changed my opinion on miley<br>  i like her now, shes messed up yeah, but that was ages ago and its sad if you can stay mad at someone for the same thing forever. everytime she does any small thing the world is put on hold and its completely blown out of proportion!<br>  and for the ones who say shes loud and anoying, well its because shes a teenager!<br>  and i think she has talent, she has so much singing potential but i supose afew singing lessons could improve her voice..|`|cX9PiCqQaa	I like her, because I think she's sweet, talented, strong, and beautiful. She makes lots of mistakes, but who are we to judge her for that? Everyone bashes her because she's such a "horrible role model", but no one should emulate anyone else exactly. Pick her good characteristics and model those, and disregard the bad ones.|`|l1Dl30g9aa	i hate her!<br>  because she is annoying, and clearly loves herself. her fashion sense is horrible too, and she is a bad role model. <br>  the only good thing about her, is her TV show can sometimes make me laugh...|`|NET9UMSGaa	I don't like her or dislike her....I just don't listen to her music or watch her show because it's not my type<br>  <br>  I have nothing against her though|`|xzo9MbMAaa	dislike. she hate her fans and i think she slaped one of the jonas brother?|`|7yWBeUSmaa	I don't like Miley, I LOVE HER!!

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	It kind of depends upon whether you read the original comics or graphic novel (and whether or not you liked it)<br>  <br>  It's a very faithful adaptation of the original graphic novel- in that regard it's great.  As a movie for people with no prior familiarity with the characters or storyline, it's just ok.  The acting wasn't great- a couple of characters were very good, others were mediocre. The representation of some historical figures (like president Nixon) was poor.<br>  <br>  Overall it was a good movie- about a 7.5|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Great movie because it was very faithful to the graphic novel.

8oe5Wkl5aa	Definitely Alter Bridge. They have an amazing guitarist who is underrated. Check out their songs Blackbird, Open Their Eyes, Find the Real.<br>  Also, Thornley. A little repetitious, but the choruses pull it together. Not bad for an alternative rock group.<br>  Theory of a Deadman is GREAT and awesome in concert!<br>  Another good one: Cold. Their earlier albums are darker/heavier and emotive, but their newest album is alright. Check out the Year of the Spider album!<br>  Hopefully you already know Shinedown. If not, check them out.<br>  Strapping Young Lads are pretty intense.<br>  Rammstein has amazing energy and vocals and bass line.<br>  Symphony-X  has good stuff too.|`|Wx1XVezOaa	what kind of music are you into metal hard rock or what because i have some good suggestions okay is this super cool screamo band there awesome and i love them so much there called blessthefall craig from escape the fate used to be with this band he is lame now !!!! This other band that you should listen to is called as i lay dying there super cool screamo too. This other band is called ill nino there kind of like alternative really cool band too so yea these are good suggestions that you make like and this other band is called mindless self indulgence!!|`|wYAgw73Naa	Chelsea grin, bring me the horizon, the faceless, the red shore<br>  <br>  amazing bands.|`|On5mPAb6aa	I recommend Semi Precious Weapons (glam rock).

They seem to be very underrated, but they are a great melodeath (melodic death metal) band.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnhdJVh9iIY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnhdJVh9i...</a><br>  Also I don't hear about the Black Crowes too often, and they are good too.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a76FeV2-Dw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a76FeV2-...</a>|`|89xzNpVaaa	Yeah i love those band you wrote about above!<br>  Opeth <br>  Porcupine Tree<br>  Sepultura<br>  None of them are mainstream and not really known by people, but pretty well known to me.|`|SOGkJSN4aa	egypt central<br>  they have so many good songs but their not really known.<br>  my favorite songs from them are "you make me sick", "taking you down", and "over and under".<br>  you should listen to them =)|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Led Zepplin|`|cTYhnumDaa	I would say some bands that aren't well know where I am from are..<br>  <br>  Apocalyptica - Great Metallica covers, they also have Adam Gontier (Three days grace) singing in a song, Corey Taylor (Slipknot) singing a song and Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil), based on Cello, violin etc. Powerful music.<br>  <br>  Lacuna Coil - Gothic rock/metal band, Cristina Scabbia is the singer and is really good, they have songs on guitarhero 3 and guitar hero world tour. Done a great cover of Enjoy the Silence. They are sort of well known though i suppose but nobody over here really knows them.<br>  <br>  Testament - Support band along with Megadeth for Judas Priest. A band who in my Opinion were overlooked as they were big during the time Metallica were at their prime so didn't really get the recognition they deserve<br>  <br>  Prong - I love this band a lot and they definitely need a big break. Their albums are great. I recommend the song "Pure ether" for starters. Decent singing too.<br>  <br>  Sanctity - Great band, amazing guitar work, they are also very melodic at parts and are extremely enjoyable to listen too. All of their songs are catchy I would say.<br>  <br>  Priestess - Yep, they have a song on guitar hero called "Lay down" and it's really good. People seem to think that would be their only good song but I recommend listening to their songs. Even though their a reasonably new band they have an old school sound. Try "Talk to Her"<br>  <br>  Rise Against - You might have heard of them, They are also really good and easy to listen too.<br>  <br>  Skillet - Christian Rock band, great singing, very catchy songs. There hasn't been a song of theirs I have liked or grown to like to be honest. Lot's of emotion in some songs too.<br>  <br>  Arch Enemy - I LOVE this band, they are so awesome, a death metal band from Sweden but the singer Angela Gossow is from Germany, for a girl she can sure roar. Two of my favorite Guitarists in this band after Dimebag, Mike and Chris Amott who happen to be brothers and are amazing when they play together. Try "Nemesis", "Revolution begins" and "We will Rise". Try the album "Doomsday Machine and Rise of the Tyrant"<br>  <br>  Shadows Fall - One of my favorite bands, Amazing live and amazing at the guitar. The singing is great too. Try "Redemption" and "The Light That Blinds"<br>  <br>  Other bands without a description because I'm becoming lazy<br>  <br>  Saosin<br>  Chiodos<br>  Breaking Benjamin (I think they aren't popular but aren't not well known if you know what I mean.<br>  Pillar<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yeah and I love Anberlin, My favorite two songs by them would be The feel Good Drag and Paperthin hymn =P
82Zl5gqlaa	I am going through something similar.  This happened both with Lost and Battlestar Galactica, which are the best and second best show on television right now.<br>  <br>  One thing I do to make it easier is watch the most recent episode a few times during the week.  You will almost always see something you didn't catch in the second viewing and sometimes even the third.<br>  <br>  The Lost writers like to throw in a bunch of clues ( or red herrings).  For instance, one of the prevailing theories is that the Losties are reincarnations of ancient gods.  The most recent episode showed Hurley sketching the Sphinx (is he Ra?).  Also, the van that Ben has been driving around says Canton-Rainier on the side, which is an anagram for reincarnation.<br>  <br>  Lots of stuff to see.  Several viewings are required to catch everything.|`|27b1TPkCaa	I am right there with you with your passion for LOST.  I am way to obsessed with that show.  From theories, to podcasts to show reviews on youtube.  One thing that may help you is this link here, this is a guy who recaps episodes and finds things you may have not noticed I know I havent and I watch pretty closely.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/smolesiuk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/smolesiuk</a>|`|Qdb5LZMCaa	Like you, I too didnt watch the show when it first started. I actually spent Sept.- Jan watching all 4 seasons to get caught up. And like you I find myself having a hard time waiting a week for a new episode... But It will be Wed. Soon so hang in there lol.|`|e43c59dad3d9d6ca0d944fb64789b9ccaa	It would be nice if they could go home.|`|5DnRYxgHaa	I can't relate to your anxiety between episodes because I began watching Lost from the pilot. I do remember being anxious that it would get canceled before my questions were answered (to think, the questions I had then and the ones I have now! haha!) <br>  <br>  I love the show, it's definitely my favorite on TV and has been for a while now. As for who I can relate to the most, I'm about as neurotic as Jack though, so I guess maybe him.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I am a Big Fan of LOST.  I started watching when they showed episodes on SciFi channel a couple of months ago.  I've seen most of them, but would like to re-watch them all.  I'm hooked for sure.  It's hard to wait a week between new episodes.<br>  <br>  I don't relate to the Losties very well, so I think maybe I'd be a part of the Dharma Project, or maybe work for Daniel Faraday.  I'm kinda nerdy.  I'm an old woman, like Mrs. Hawking.|`|JmzHvt71aa	By far the best show on television and if you are interested in Lost then rent or buy a show from the 60s called "The Prisoner" starring Patrick McGoohan.<br>  <br>  I relate most to Desmond. Awesome character and the only person in the whole show who has never done anything bad to anyone.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Oh my gosh! I haven't seen that movie in such a long time. "Hello Down There" is an oldie from 1969. Scientist Fred Miller (Tony Randall) will do anything in the name of science. That's why he's agreed to live for one month underwater, in a home created especially for that purpose. His wife, Vivian (Janet Leigh), and his kids, however, aren't as enthusiastic about the enterprise. In spite of their misgivings, they go along with it anyway. But as expected, human nature has a way of messing up the best-laid plans. It had a lot of other stars, too:<br>   Jim Backus <br>  Ken Berry  <br>   Roddy McDowall  <br>   Charlotte Rae <br>  Richard Dreyfuss<br>  <br>  P.S.--Credit goes to dapheyduck for reminding me of the title--I couldn't think of it.|`|W6NGihsSaa	the Little Mermaid|`|31cf2a3995a7e000ff27474f546fb219aa	It was called "Hello Down There".<br>  i think it was "little goldfish" rather than "blowfish"

This girl who I knew for 7 year was the love of my life, or I thought she was...I went to Germany for a little less than a year, I come back and she has another dude, we even talked about growing old together, having kids, all that, and I come back and she has another man...I was heart broken needless to say. But I went to school, met another MUCH better girl, and we're still together to this day, and I'm 20 years old.<br>  <br>  Try to get her back dude. Don't give up. But if it's IMPOSSIBLE, then it's not worth it. There are a lot of better girls out there man, just remember.<br>  <br>  No one's out of your league.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Your just gonna have to be brave and confident telling her how you feel.  I mean don't come at her too strong but don't come at her weak either.  She will let you know if she is interested or not.  Even if she is not don't give up every now and again greet her and say mindful things letting her know exactly where you stand and that your still interested.  The best thing is to be confident and not scared!! Most women like a tough men which they naturally seek men to be.  Good luck!|`|iLhTHtuvaa	shes a beautiful girl<br>  <br>  <br>  and you need to explain what happened<br>  <br>  but honestly<br>  the most you can hope for is being really good friends again<br>  <br>  she might not want to go out with you again<br>  <br>  and you don't need to worry about "leagues" because you went out with her once so clearly she felt you were right in her "league"<br>  <br>  <br>  besides   "leagues" are childish attraction doesn't go by "leagues"|`|ixweJGk6aa	DUDE!!!!  First of all stop thinking any girl is out of your league.  Only you think a girl is out of your league.  There is no league unless you make a league.<br>  <br>  Did I use the word league enough?<br>  <br>  Center and relax!  Calm, breath, relax.  This girl has you all tied up in knots.  She has done nothing, it is you.  Calm down!  If she is smiling at you and still talks to you then all is well.  Girls give off obvious signals when they like a guy.  You need to see them is all.  Her willingness to talk to you is a huge one.   She laughs at your jokes...  If she will still pay attention to you then you are still fine.<br>  <br>  HINT:  Distance yourself and she will come to you.  Stop being available.  Date other girls.  I know this seems wrong but trust me, whatever you are feeling inside, do the opposite.  Being clingy or needy will drive her away.  Good luck.|`|wx4RuBgbaa	I can't really give you much advice, but I have experience with going out with guys and girls. One time, I had a similar problem with a girl, and I just asked to talk to her in private. I told her that I had made the biggest mistake of my life by breaking up with her, and that I wanted to go back out with her. Just try telling her how you feel. Be straight-forward and honest. It worked for me.|`|AA11413347	omg she is HOT!

He tries to photograph the clubâs âgoddessâ, a 15-year-old girl named Kagura, but is discovered. As he is about to be killed, Kagura kisses him, granting him the ability to destroy anything he photographs. Kaguraâs body fluids can give people bizarre abilities related to their fetishes or obsessions.

When Shotaro came to Tokyo to debut as a singer, she followed him and worked to provide for him. But one day, Kyoko overhears Shota telling his manager that Kyoko means nothing to him. Sheâs just convenient, a housekeeper. This makes Kyoko furious, and she vows revenge on Shotaro. But Shotaro just laughs at her, saying she wonât be able to touch him because heâs now a popular singer and sheâs a nobody. So Kyoko decides to get into showbiz and become even more popular than Shotaro to humiliate him. Unfortunately, Shotaro has destroyed Kyokoâs ability to love, and she discovers that it is a prerequisite for her to debut from her chosen company, LME.

QEuhPEb7aa	2 should be enough. One plays lead and the other plays some rhythm.<br>  <br>  But since you want a hard rock band, I'd suggest about 3 guitarists.<br>  <br>  The first two will play lead, the first lead could play on higher scales while the second one should play lower scales. The 2 lead players could also play different riffs to expand the entire song.<br>  <br>  The lone rhythm guitarist should maintain a base sound for the 2 lead players to expand and explore on.<br>  <br>  A bit of a note, a bassist is not a guitarist !

00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	I'm sorry but your description is very vague but from what I read, could it be G Force Guardians of the Planet aka Battle of the Planets or Robotech? I provided a link to both animes.|`|d70af5b97c8e2c9b3cd22bb36a58c59caa	SilverHawks?  Wasn't an anime, persey, but it came out of the same era as Thundercats, and Heman, and Transformers.  was '87-'90's ish in it's runtime.
akcGfgdcaa	Sure it's not the Mask of Zorro?|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	You're probably thinking of The Phantom, back in 1996.  The hero had a ring with a skull on it.
QJIXTpZ5aa	I'm afraid it's not going to become a manga anytime soon.|`|LSn5iF47aa	Nope, no plans for a Beauty Pop anime ^^. <br>  <br>  The mangaka is working on a new series now so I don't think she's planning anything for an anime ^^. But another work of hers, Magical Star Magical Emi, was made into an anime. :p|`|WeqoJbIdaa	There is only a drama cd out and I haven't heard anything about it being turned into an anime but you're right, it would be great!!
dJfvy8Cvaa	You could do a Bourne Ultimatum type movie, but set in a middle school.

I get these choices: Tan, black white. Sports or underwire.<br>  <br>  that's it. and they always come up way to high so i can't wear low cut shirts. they are a huge issue for me..|`|voyH3d1Kaa	I don't actually know. I'm wearing a 36D at the moment but it's too small.<br>  <br>  No I'm not comfortable with them.

sto6AoRtaa	cotton candy, it can't spill all over, and It sounds like fun!!!
c5cf5ebcdcabfcd6ad2b3cc1bd7ac72baa	Probably not. Anytime I have read a book and then a movie has been made based on the book, the movie is never as good as the book.  Even if it is a good movie, never as good as the book:<br>  Sahara, The Hunt for Red October, Raise The Titanic, Beastmaster, The Guns of Navarone.<br>  All movies based on books.|`|AqDson6zaa	Yes, because the graphic novel is awesome. And I'm sure it'd help with the plot and understanding it and everything.<br>  <br>  It's pretty long, so if you plan on seeing it tonight or tomorrow count it out unless you're reading all day. Like, more than 200 pages....|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	It would be a good idea, at least to know the backstory and whats going on in the movie.
2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	In what way?  The watchman is a much more faithful adaptation of the source material, but the Dark Knight is a much better movie.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Look at my avatar|`|zovrJ0yXaa	the dark knight is far, far better. watchmen was ambitious and faithful to the book but ironically felt cold and didnt capture the essence of the book for me. dark knight was better by telling an original story well. watchmen was just grabs of parts of the comic without the cumulative power the novel has. it was cold where dark knight was powerful|`|AA12108244	There's no comparison, it's a matter of preference. <br>  <br>  I think Dark Knight is the better film but I have yet to see the Watchmen Director's Cut, which could prove to be a vast improvement over the theatrical version.|`|OKmJWGGGaa	are you seriously asking this? LOL.<br>  <br>  Dark Knight. It's a no-brainer.|`|O6I6ssaNaa	The Dark Knight. Duh!|`|tZ7odW9yaa	HOLY CRAP THATS A NO BRAINER!!> The Dark Knight Silly!!! The whole thing is great because The Joker doesnt care if Batman kills him because that would mean he broke his own rule. Which therefore he would turn evil.

T6WYXtdfaa	no, anti-depressants did not make me more depressed. it did the opposite.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	No, medicine does not cause depression. The tems "mental illness" and "depression" are 2 entirely different things. <br>  <br>  I would describe the feeling of depression as;  fear, sadness, lethargy|`|xYLnLCVVaa	i am on depression medication and it does not make me more depressed, it actually helps me a little. not a lot or anything, but it makes my depression managable. <br>  the feeling of depression is just gloomy.<br>  you feel weak, bored, sad..etc. there are so many different emotions that go with it.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	No, medication will ease the depression, but can only ever treat the symptoms, never the root cause.<br>  <br>  The site below may of some help in understanding the symptoms.<br>  <br>  Depression comes under the heading of an anxiety disorder, for which there are many symptoms as you will see.<br>  <br>  In my case, I could be depressed one day and then the next have a panic attack, and both would be related - there are also some articles on that site which may again give you more info.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4zylxev4aa	they also make you gain weight .

Some cinemas just give them away, others charge. It tends to be manager's discretion.<br>  <br>  In my cinema, we charge a small amount (less than ï¿¡10, price depends on size, quality, age), but its free if you are staff or the staff vouch for you.|`|QmOmbprOaa	nation wide you can get one for $40.00 from any cinema|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	The only people I know that could get those were people who worked at the movie theater, or they either were good friends or family of the theater manager.|`|G8Fl7zv8aa	you have to ask for it and usually thell give it to u

m3UGI2BCaa	I don't know. But the first thing I would do is put all your questions and answers and profile on private so its harder for them to stalk you. You may even want to change your listed name in your preferences so its harder to find your stuff with the search feature too. If you think you MIGHT know who it is, block them just in case.<br>  Also maybe you can contest each report.  Yes if you suspect your fans delete your fans too. Hit your settings and preferences and disable all that. Go on lock down.<br>  I hate trolls.|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	You have a troll, remove your contacts and that might help!|`|0FwVGYEYaa	a troll and  change your appearance for a day or two  and name|`|4rdKpvPGaa	Send an appeal to y/a|`|PYmdmuw8aa	You have a Troll change your name!|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	Send Y! help an e-mail and ask for an appeal.

I1w0HfQbaa	I have the movie on DVD and did not feel it was his best work. It is about a former sex starlet and sex addiction. The conflict between a neighborhood which wants order and another which wants sexual liberty is apparent here. But it is not John Water's best film. Truth be told, I felt disappointed with the film. It is funny but in small spots. The movie of people getting injured when they bump their heads and become sex pervs are hard to believe and is outlandish.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I'm a John Waters fan.

AA11916920	I was excited to finally watch it.  I read up a little bit on the story before I watched the movie.  There was an e-mail that was sent by the real life escort and everything that he mentioned in the e-mail about his experience was in the movie.<br>  Being a military man myself, I will admit that this movie made me tear up.  The part that got me the most was on their drive from the airport to Chance's home town.  The part of watching the passing cars turn on their headlights and fall in line like a funeral procession just made me lose it.  The other part that got me was when he met the Army Sgt. on the tarmac who was escorting his own brother home.<br>  It is a wonderful story of dedication, heroism, and respect.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Yes, I saw it. It was very quietly moving. No fanfare just a portrayal of a man trying to do the right thing and the people of American standing quietly behind him. I can imagine that it was just like that from the real-life story.

I would cry if some one in my family died, if I think about all the children dead from war, if I was going out with a girl and she broke up with me, or if I see a sad movie. I am 18 so I don't really know what would make a 14 year old cry, but I know a blow to the testicles can make any guy cry!|`|HCbgV86zaa	No. Guys are heartless Jerks!|`|Zs6tGDvsaa	oh they cry alright!|`|9kxIDQUraa	yes.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	I cry all the time, but frankly, very few people have seen me.  What makes me cry mostly is people falling in love, little kids laughing or smiling but also kids being hurt or abused, so the good and the bad.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	of course every human out there has feelings|`|UqrVp0P7aa	Yeah, just that we don't show it.<br>  <br>  I mean, i don't cry with an agonizing voice or something, i just let silent fills the air and let my tears run down my face, while making sure no one is there to see me doing it.<br>  <br>  I cry cause of the sh1ts that's been happenin in my life and the thought of what could be worse etc<br>  And if i'd lose the only person that makes me happy....|`|bDUbJ7aAaa	of course they cry, even though i dont see them cry either. except 1 last year cried because he got yelled at by the meanist teacher and she threatened to call his mom about his "behavior" it was stupid.|`|gIitANOkaa	yeah they do...<br>  <br>  they cry when they get frustrated...|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	They do.

ojEkgJoqaa	the answer lies in the people who are home schooling her?<br>  <br>  you can make your decision now|`|BQXg09m9aa	Well, smart has nothing to do with school. <br>  <br>  But, if you mean getting good grades then yes.

She'd probably be that girl that asks to cheat off you.|`|D1iHwbtxaa	no|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	Probably. Lord knows she has enough money to get herself the best education possible. <br>  <br>  <br>  How "book smart" she is won't matter anyways... as long as she is wise enough to keep from blowing all her money.|`|cgXX13YVaa	Smart , NO!<br>  Hot, YES<br>  Annoying , YES<br>  sings great, NO!<br>  <br>  All in all, she's alright!|`|qwInrvUGaa	no comment|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	No|`|xuM1avMIaa	pfft no|`|tWmibIWFaa	maybe! im not with her when she home schooling so i can't say!|`|K9JJLVgFaa	AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...|`|J30Gh5O6aa	um probably, i dont like her i think shes a horrid singer but she has to be pretty smart im sure. she seems it.|`|itIUEZdaaa	Probably.  She's a freakin millionaire, so you would think she has a really good tutor.|`|y2t3F690aa	Mmmm NO|`|6aawDPkSaa	if she was, she would behave more sensibly|`|bH6KUo3jaa	hellz no|`|c0gLj6Paaa	heck no.|`|zjEGtuXuaa	who needs smarts when you have that kinda money!|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	a genius / no doubt / people hate her / and she is very rich|`|RP5NnxgUaa	No. She seems like all she cares about is what people think and that type of stuff. She seems to me like a high school drop out.

And yeah, I feel for anyone who has a heart attack.|`|EchBsT2Oaa	I feel immensely concerned for him, yes. <br>  <br>  As for my favorites, I've liked all the ones he's been in, but not just for that fact. Few of mine though would be Mrs. Doubtfire, Insomnia, The Fisher King, Hook, Man Of The Year (I don't see what people find wrong with it, it's dark humor/satire, not an actual comedy. Most people don't understand that) Good Will Hunting (even though I can't stand Matt Damon) August Rush, What Dreams May Come (do NOT watch that one if you're sensitive, or without a box of tissues) Patch Adams, The Birdcage, and Good Morning, Vietnam.<br>  <br>  Of course, then you have the voice overs of Happy Feet, Fern Gully, and of course, Aladdin. I still have yet to see One Hour Photo or Dead Poet's society though, which I do plan on.<br>  <br>  Plus, I loved Mork And mindy when I was a kid.<br>  <br>  Nanu-nanu, Robin.

Hope he pulls through|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Good Will Hunting is the best movie ever. My prayers are with him.

I make $40 an hour right now.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	From what I hear on the news, job prospects in California are worse than where you are now.

nCLcdJO0aa	I think this should be in Books & Authors.<br>  <br>  I really didn't like 'I was having about, sigh, him.' No one really thinks like that!<br>  Try, 'I was having about...him.' It just makes more sense to me.<br>  <br>  I always re-write the story how I prefer it. Is that OK?<br>  <br>  'Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep-beep-beep,'<br>  Ugh...alarm clocks have got to be THE most annoying thing on the planet.<br>  I hit the snooze button, desperately hoping that a couple more minutes lying in bed would send me back to sleep. I closed my eyes, willing myself to dream about...him.<br>  After four minutes, I gave up, and frustrated, I threw back my polka-dot duvet and swung my legs over the side of the bed.<br>  I padded slowly to the bathroom to freshen up. As the water heated up, I had half a second to think about Mason...his deep brown eyes...his dark, floppy hair...and most importantly, the way bells seemed to ring every time he laughed. Just the thought of all these things set my heart racing at 100 miles an hour.<br>  I soaked a flannel and slapped the burning fabric onto my face and began to wipe away my tiredness.<br>  "Annalee! Are you almost done, sweetie?" called Mum from downstairs.<br>  "Yeah, coming!" I yelled back. I wrung out the flannel and hung it on the edge of the bath. I started down the stairs, unable to bring my thoughts away from Mason.<br>  I slumped down on the hard wooden chair, eyeing the box of chocolate Pop-Tarts sitting on the counter.<br>  I grabbed a couple and threw them into the toaster and poured myself a glass of milk, nearly pouring the sticky white liquid over my arm in my absent-mindedness.<br>  As I reached over to the toaster to grab my Pop-Tarts, I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflective metal. I looked a mess, with my bed-hair, tired-looking eyes and a huge spot glaring at me from my chin. <br>  That was when I realised I'd better skip breakfast and speed up if I wanted to look presentable for school.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for the grammatical errors. Not exactly my favourite part.<br>  You've forgotten to put in paragraphs, and misspelt pyjamas. It has a 'y' instead of an 'a'.<br>  <br>  I would like to read on, and it's very good!|`|doMb3872aa	it must be good if i read the whole thing usually i would just read half of it but that was really good you had a couple of mistakes but besides that it was very interesting if you haven't heard about this join this site called <a href="http://youngwriterssociety.com" rel="nofollow">http://youngwriterssociety.com</a> it's really good you can post stories, songs, poems, scripts, and MUCH MORE for people like you to critique your work|`|UAf3R1Cgaa	Ima middleSchool girl and that was AMAZING!! lol i love writing but never considered writing a "story" dunno who Stephanie Meyer is.

A little proof reading and your imagination.....honey, your gunna go FAR|`|svYiQZUHaa	I thought it was good. I don't see how it is like Twilight or the other books of the series. You should keep writing. It Just needs a few critique's.|`|ceQfqvaXaa	I really enjoyed it, but try and fix this part:<br>  Instead of:<br>  I was having of, sigh, him.<br>  Try:<br>  I was having of - sigh - him.<br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|l737Fkh1aa	It's okay. A little childish and definitely needs some work done. I can see this as a book for middle school girls or elementary school girls or boys more so.|`|d8LyjT8Xaa	To me its catchy cuz i like reading about normal lifes, but make it not so cheesy<br>  So far i like it!:)|`|G1VsV0wWaa	It totally sucks.<br>  Start over and try to write something at least half way enjoyable.|`|MmfsXkWlaa	It's okay. :)|`|y2MMr8m7aa	I really like it! You should DEFInATELY write more!<br>  I would totally buy this book.|`|GIoVC3wIaa	i like it(: <br>  you will have to give me the link so i can finishe reading the story!!<br>  <br>  i'd say your 13-14 but its just a guess|`|LqupBucBaa	its okay. matches my sis.|`|AtinnDupaa	First of all, your writing is like Stephanie Meyer. Don't even deny it.<br>  Secondly, it's really too...sugary sweet. Try to mix it up a bit. <br>  Last, it's really well-written and I think that most people who took the time to read it would enjoy it. <br>  Great use of adjectives by the way. :D<br>  Good luck with the rest of it.|`|Crp7g541aa	It's nice :]<br>  <br>  I occasionally write stories- a lot similar to this.<br>  I love the name Mason.<br>  I disagree with the person who said it's too, " cutesy."<br>  I like the " sigh." and " yess" and It doesn't sound ANYTHING like the Twilight series books.<br>  Ugh.. Now I wanna go write a story- * I won't copy *<br>  :] GOOD JOB!|`|XotWm3ICaa	I think this story is really great so far but one thing..... when you said 100 miles and hour its supposed to be per hour or an hour not and hour. Good luck writing the rest of the story!<br>  Also what I think is after this right here instead of hearing that she's eating the poptart and exetera you should go and tell a little bit of background information about herself and some about Mason.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Perfect thus far|`|ipiCyE3zaa	It sounds like a beginning to a good story<br>  however, your vocab and grammer could be more imaginative<br>  to start with, you could use less "beep"s at the start: just a couple is enough to get the readers attention.

It is that feeling of being cared for and nurtured. Some people would describe this as the type of love parents have for their children. This is so important: high on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; and studies have even proven that people have died of a "broken heart" (there have been no explanations for their deaths other than that).<br>  <br>  FRIENDSHIP LOVE:<br>  This is a love between yourself and someone that is totally honest, open and comfortable. You really only have this kind of bond with a few people. You might know a lot of people and be "friendly" with them in a group situation but they are not the best friends I am talking about here.<br>  I have a theory that you can not truely be best friends with a member of the opposite sex. Down the line romance will always come up from either party and feelings will be misinterpreted and mistaken. When this happens, the friendship will change and possibly never be the same again.<br>  <br>  ROMANTIC LOVE:<br>  (The much anticipated love!) Most people experience this type of love many times in their life. It is when you see that person for the first time and he/she makes your knees go weak or gives you butterflies in your stomach.i.e. "Love at first sightâ. Most people donât even love the person they think they are in love withâ¦they fall in love with the idea if being in love. This is more of a lustful kind of love, it wears off after a while and hopefully leads to...<br>  <br>  UNCONDITIONAL LOVE:<br>  This is the sincere love, the love that lasts forever. This kind of love comes when you have found the person you are destined to be with. Nothing can destroy unconditional love. It is like when you have an argument or disagree about something with that person and you realize that it doesnât bother you because the love you have for him/her overcomes everything.|`|ZHGMLPhuaa	Well there's passanite love, friend love, family love, free spirt love, fake love, true love, just feel good love, marrage love, family love, sad love, missing love, head over heals love, obsesion love, school love, secret love, and many, many more!!!!! so I hope that helps with you poll BYE!!!!!!!|`|yLVys9uTaa	there is human love, love for animals, Gods love, tree lovers/huggers/<br>  love for music, lust, love for your hobbys, family love, puppy love|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	necrophilia<br>  romantic<br>  friendly<br>  family<br>  conditional<br>  unconditional<br>  pet love<br>  love of the arts(music, literature, thater etc)<br>  self love<br>  love of money & objects (greed)|`|BQ6yIRFUaa	stupid love <br>  crazy love <br>  kind love <br>  family love <br>  friendship love <br>  passionate love <br>  love of money<br>  love of material things<br>  God's Love<br>  Unconditional Love<br>  Lustful Love|`|3PFLXvZhaa	romantic love<br>  friendship love<br>  brother-sister love<br>  mother child love<br>  family member loves (aunts uncles etc.)<br>  pet love with a dog maybe<br>  material love (for a object)|`|RzTb60Ufaa	There's four of them according to the greeks:<br>  <br>  Erotic<br>  Platonic<br>  Familial<br>  Romantic<br>  <br>  I can't remember how to say them in Greek, but it was really cool|`|4D2ZRK6naa	good love<br>  man & woman love<br>  gay love<br>  fatherly love<br>  family love<br>  friendship love<br>  brotha love!!!!!|`|wvH6xzqjaa	family<br>  sex<br>  bff<br>  bf<br>  gf<br>  bfff<br>  bffffff|`|28VCKqDIaa	theres;<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  love<br>  && LOVE!|`|HPprnotuaa	Intimate and just plain stupid love|`|jUzcucmQaa	what|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	There's only one.

h95e3zzjaa	Yea ppl can get ticketed for diving below the speeding limit|`|33e51f7799d322ea5299d7f32d67155caa	First, it depends on what the posted speed limit is.  There are some places that have a minimum speed limit as well as a maximum speed limit.  No matter what the speed limit, if you are driving too slowly, you are creating as much of a hazard as if you were driving too fast.  You can get a ticket for impeding traffic or creating unsafe conditions.<br>  <br>  My sister was pulled over for driving too slowly and received a lecture from the police officer on the dangers of driving too slowly.  He let her off with a warning.<br>  <br>  Driving too slow or too fast are both classified as Moving Violations. See the link below.|`|Svgc3izpaa	Do you ever notice that tractors or slow moving equipment have large orange triangles?  That is because it would be dangerous to be driving so far below the speed limit, for the drivers coming up behind you.|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	Driving at any speed is prohibited if it interferes with the flow of traffic.  If driving 15 mph was holding up several other cars, it's easy to understand the ticket.|`|RiQA4Epraa	obviously it is<br>  <br>  if its 15mph in a 15mph zone, no its not illegal<br>  <br>  15mph in a 55mph zone, yes its illegal|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	you can get a ticket for driving below 45 mph on a interstate|`|QOWPdl2qaa	Yeah, if you're going too slow it can be very dangerous, depending on the speed limit.|`|nDEVWjCEaa	was it on a busy road?? <br>  i know that going too slow is almost as bad as going to fast... <br>  so maybe|`|afQBWPWzaa	Did he or  you check the speed limit?? It is not allegal not unless he pass the limit|`|EoCadP7kaa	yes. on a highway, the minimum is 40|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes it's too slow on an open road. It's a more suitable speed in a built up area.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	You can get arrested for driving to slow, because it can hold up traffic and cause accidents.<br>  Plus, its freaking annoying:)|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It's called obstructing traffic, so yes - it's a traffic violation.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Yeah, it's dangerous if you're going above or below the speed limit.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	yes cops can write you a ticket for anything|`|tWmibIWFaa	yeah he was below the speed limit!
MHzNI9Yvaa	A lot of my friends have, and where i live you can.<br>  But its soooooo worth the laugh!|`|aEeCCHVlaa	It is called Public Indecency no matter where it is done and you can be arrested and go to jail if you do it.   Why do you want to try it?  You must want a criminal record very badly to even consider it.|`|7b5CfjeWaa	go for it.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Yes, it's called public nudity.  But, give it a try.  At least you'll have a really cool story to tell your kids.|`|ufU0VNLUaa	Try it and put a video of it on YouTube LOL|`|8SKpsVG7aa	Do it but make sure you have someone there to videotape it|`|V5K66Xb4aa	have you ever heard of indescent exposure?|`|tWmibIWFaa	Hell Yeah  go for it!|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	There's a famous guy form England that has done it twice a t NFL football games and mostly English SOccer games.  It's hilarious.  But he does get arrested everytime.  So do it if you want to get locked up.<br>  Just don't bend over while you are in prison since you will already be naked.|`|LRo8sgCiaa	yes and no.|`|zdSRsySNaa	It depends how much you like football. Even fully clothed, entering the field of play during a match will get you banned from football matches. You may well be arrested as well, especially if you ARE streaking.|`|T6WYXtdfaa	yes you should try it, no you won't get arrested. i don't think your penis is large enough to offend anyone. it would be like seeing a little baby running around naked. who would arrest a baby??|`|VQPgNedQaa	yes u can|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	I would say yes as they would consider it indecent exposure. But, on the other side of the coin. You would get a lot of attention and reactions from others. And, it would be fun for you!|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	do it u wont|`|k9PT5kfhaa	probably wont go to jail if you did it in england you might if u do it in eastern europe. do it at a man u game and take out rooney|`|0a678b8265a1cbb27897a7a8bb0101daaa	As long as the person streaking your hair is behind you and you are causing no one else's loss of enjoyment at the game!!!   :-)  <br>  So, the bare truth is, sure! try it!!|`|sGq6TC2faa	yeah you can.  our swim team at my high school ran into the gym during a girls basketball game with only their speedos on.  it was hilarious.  and this is a Catholic school!|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Yes you can go to jail. It is indecent exposure. If you were a girl i'd say go for it.|`|delMvf8iaa	>Yes you could go to jail for indecent exploder.It sure would be fun to make head line news.|`|32432a1d871c3a8e6357a03f6486bec3aa	do it. you only live once.  it's not a felony|`|zgDxpqRsaa	no you kant go 2 jail<br>  <br>  do it and  put on a real show|`|tXWFDp2Uaa	DO IT!!!|`|4f2GaLhpaa	It depends on how fast you run|`|Cyg3exYdaa	you should so do it?|`|IKUrjzucaa	probably and why would you wnat to? why is this such an appealing activity to guys? what if theres a gay guy in the audience? not that theres anything wrong with that...|`|s0RM0LkFaa	yes u can go to jail. pay fines and community service. if you were gonna do it think about it and dont embarass yourself.|`|uhTMdZeVaa	Dunno, but you should definitely try it.|`|r53RW7vAaa	Yes.Don't you watch the news.If you want to be arrested go for it.|`|Mm2LSrjsaa	Haha why not. I'm not sure about jail. But... have you seen fans run on the pitch on TV before? It isn't pretty...  so prepare to get rushed by a few stewards... and maybe even a player! Good luck!|`|N2lItE8qaa	ya i think you can get fined and prolly go to jail|`|NPymuePEaa	Yes. and No. But whatever you want.|`|e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	If you are as good at it as this guy, try it: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIPv9AtZ2zE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIPv9AtZ2...</a><br>  <br>  But be careful, those players are a mean bunch, even when they are high in the air...<br>  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/18/pro-soccer-team-helps-sub_n_113718.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/18...</a>|`|hVGyhpMmaa	maybe|`|rM9WzIkHaa	make sure its ITS NOT COLD OUT!!!!!!!!!

Chilling.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	No, go for it.Lol|`|9o7KlfvKaa	I would imagine so. If it is an exact replica of an actual human, I would consider it homicide.|`|WUfJaIOHaa	I would think that it would be the same. If the clone is living ,breathing on it's own.But this IS an odd question for real. You want to kill a clone or what ?! lol  :)|`|hMF3kg3Baa	Killing is killing|`|LHcdLTOxaa	no, a human clone would not be the same product as an actual human being.|`|TsQumtCLaa	yes|`|bglr4m0Naa	yes|`|TApVoMdAaa	Why do you ask?|`|GdBUmFFCaa	Yes. Because it's from the very beginning a "alive form", just as if it was a first-step fetus: Very small but alive.<br>  So, if you kill it, it is just as if performing an abortion: Killing an alive human being.<br>  It is your choice now...

You got to the mall before the ambulance left.<br>  2. They carried her out, not wheeled her out.<br>  3. Ambulances usually have paramedics not nurses.<br>  4. Ambulances seldom let people ride along.<br>  5. She's stable, but I really thought I lost her....and still might...... and you went home and  took time on your blackberry to write this not knowing if she's going to make it? Or you take your laptop everywhere and there is wifi in the hospital (doubt the hospital has public wifi for male type A heart attacks)<br>  <br>  Whats the diagnosis ? <br>  <br>  I have a hard time with this.|`|VU97XJzfaa	That's sad, I hope your mom is OK.

Of course none of that applies when I've had a little too much wine. lol  I've messed up more than a few times under those circumstances and have regretted saying what I did.  In my opinion somethings are just better left unsaid.|`|uLPnHD9oaa	never ever ever never ever ever ever i say what pops into my head all the timeee. ham.|`|7b5CfjeWaa	yeaa rarely for me too..im bout to curse ma teacher outt cuz shes a hoe..but i do hold back for my parentz sometimes.|`|zjEGtuXuaa	not on yahoo answers!|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	only every time I speak - hahaha - see - if you say what's on your mind, you get your account suspended!!!!|`|tmwOwc0Laa	Quite often...i usally dont say much..unless you make me really mad..then i will say something and most likely never shut up|`|PkCqIfMFaa	about 20% of the time, i would say. lol but i consider myself pretty straight forward, i dont say what i am thinking sometimes in class, but thats about it, but that is alot of my discussions where i hold back.|`|nooi0ldjaa	90% of the time, if i said what i thought i would in a padded room by now.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Many times I whisper it under my breathe.<br>  <br>  It's great when they hear it but you just  smile and look at them like "What? :)"|`|i3pF86HNaa	a lot actually.

flGXcxwGaa	lol nothing will happen. It will simply have better soil where the roots lay. The person who said if you place it on bottom nothing will happen is way incorrect. Top soil is a grade of soil. It can be placed anywhere. It does not have to go on top. It simply means the grade of it is top soil so therefore it was soil that was pulled from the top.|`|mggll8dRaa	Till the soil 6 to 8" deep, and don't worry about 'topsoil'.....!!|`|ipqWxJyGaa	Probably the plants will grow downwards, LOL.|`|iQ7ubBAfaa	The plants will grow downwards, past the core of the Earth and sprout up in Japan, in a monsterous super-from, kicking the living crud out of Godzilla before being nuked by America...<br>  <br>  Not to stop it, but just because they're really bad at keeping their finger off the button, and have no aim control.|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	It won't grow.

pTrDWCmxaa	Hi Vera,<br>  <br>  Yes it is healthy, but I'm afraid you might end up putting on some weight instead of losing.   You are consuming too much natural sugar.  The reason why I'm saying this is because we have four fruit trees in our garden.  Every summer, my husband puts on at least five pounds from all the fruit he'll consume(apples,nectarines,pears and plums) I would cut down the fruit to 2-3 a day.  I have attached a link from the health food guide for you.   <br>  <br>  www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-alime...<br>  <br>  Take care,<br>  Alexis M.|`|HmzMLkymaa	Very very healthy...you will also have to go to the toilet quite frequently :)|`|Fb0wSA1Gaa	youll keep the doctor away for the rest of your life.|`|mIuUQ4ehaa	Nothing really bad would happen...<br>  but some times you would more likely get dierea|`|KRJNjxJzaa	you'll be an apple killer ....<br>  and <br>  when you move on to other fruit....<br>  A FRUIT KILLER!!!|`|AA10838250	possible belly ache|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Very healthy :)|`|1tlgYKROaa	Actually you will still probably lose weight.

(has a lot of fibre in it.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!<br>  <br>  Keep on eating fruit! =D<br>  <br>  [x]|`|AA11963278	That's too much fruit.<br>  <br>  Waaay too much!<br>  <br>  Consider munching on cereal bars or something like that as well... only 5 fruit and vegetable portions a day is healthy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pYtnOnbDaa	apples are great source of Fibre<br>  oranges  vitamin C<br>  Bananas potassium & Sugar<br>  <br>  all very healthy just make sure you include all the other food groups in the reasonable  qualities  as not to gain weight.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|4rdKpvPGaa	You will keep the Doctor away and the maid/milkman/postman/dog everyone.|`|y7lUgd3aaa	It's very healthy.

S02Xdc3Kaa	"Everything is okay in the end, if it's not ok, then it's not the end.."<br>  (Anonymous)<br>  ...inspired me in alot of things, and helped me understand that nothing or nobody is perfect in time. And that you just have to wait, things that need to happen will happen, it is not the end!|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	I have several faves. One is a line from the movie, The Last Convertible.<br>  " Life is fair; it breaks everyone's heart. "<br>  <br>  " Great is the guilt of an unnecessary war. "  John Adams  ( our 3rd President )<br>  <br>  But the main one right now is from the great philosopher John Stuart Mill.<br>   " A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important to him than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. "<br>  <br>   The John Adams quote has caused me to re-think my position on our invasion/occupation of Iraq. While Iraq may have been complicit in financing terrorism, & indirectly, the attacks of the 11th of September, I find it impossible now to justify our actions against Saddam and the fact that, once again, Congress failed to declare war. The last time Congress actually performed its constitutional duty to declare a war before committing our men & women in uniform ( & their families ) to sacrifice was Dec. 1941. Like many Americans, I was caught up in the whole patriotic attitude, I guess.|`|a5KpcodFaa	"JUST DO IT" by Art Williams<br>  <br>  I started my own business at the age of 17 and became a millionaire by the age of 25. Read my profile if you wish.<br>  <br>  Another one is "Faith is taking the first step even if you can't see the staircase" by Martin Luther King|`|3mJQOY4Paa	Mine is "Negative ghost rider"  haha.. because it's funny..|`|96AQZUGyaa	"Fear is temporary, regret is forever"<br>  <br>  I read that on a T-shirt for a company offering bungee jumping. I like that and always remembered it because I read it at the beginning of my university career and I took it as a sign to really change the way I had been. I was always cautious and trying to please and fit in but I learned to say "screw it all, just do it because if you don't you'll always look back at what you could have." Sometimes I find it scary to do things, things without certainty or knowing what will happen but I still remember that moment when I read it.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But, conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther King<br>  <br>  I like it because he took a stand just because it was right and he died for it, and it was the right cause.  It's inspires me not to back down on what I know is right, but I certainly don't follow it like he did.

Monster's INC<br>  <br>  I agree about Chicken Little, Just disney 3d animation is never very good, they need pixar (though I liked meet the robinson) And the only pixar movie I never liked was ratatouille, I just didn't.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Dreamworks is only good for Shrek...<br>  <br>  <br>  My favorite Pixar movie is and always will be Toy Story, great movie. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks became Buzz and Woody in my head... lol, their voices are so true to the characters. The movie is very interesting and the film does have great graphics. My favorite scene is when they are chasing the van and Buzz finally flys!|`|tLI94qWNaa	As much as I love toy story, I am going to have to go with a bugs life, I just love that one so much:D|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	They're all great, but my favorite is The Incredibles. That movie works on every level. Even though they're animated superheroes, the characters come off as ar more real than the characters in most movies. In fact, it is one of only two movies that has a scene that makes me tear up every time I see it. Plus, it looks great and is a lot of fun.|`|O3l33DVJaa	The Incredibles|`|8hv4PBlFaa	Toy Story for sure..and I was in my 20's when I first saw it!|`|XX0ac9iRaa	I think all Pixar films are fantastic (except Cars... not as spectacular as usual) and it's so hard to pick a favourite. I would probably have to say Ratatouille though... it's such a heartwarming film and the animation is just fantastic (the food looks better than REAL food!). The characters are great as well, even the minor ones (the team of chefs!), and the soundtrack is fantastic too (Oscar nomination well deserved). But all Pixar films are pretty close to the top spot in my opinion... particularly the Incredibles, Monster's Inc. and Finding Nemo.<br>  And I know what you mean about the new Disney films... I can't watch them anymore. Madagascar wasn't that bad compared to some of the animated crap that has been churned out lately (Hoodwinked was possibly the worst film I've ever seen... and don't even mention Open Season...)|`|WrlutVwKaa	Yeah, Meet the Robinsons is probably my favorite, as well as Wall-E, Ratatouille, Over the Hedge, and Open Season 1 & 2 and Madagascar 1 & 2. I know almost all of those are probably Dreamworks, but I love them!|`|BMri9tITaa	Yeesh!  I have to choose?<br>  <br>  Well WALL-E was amazing.  The dancing in space scene was just breath-taking.  But I loved Monsters, Inc. and the Incredibles, too.  Hmmph.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	I love Toy Story and Toy Story II, but if I have to pick a favorite I am going to have to say:  Finding Nemo|`|asgRcQTLaa	monster inc is also reallly cute....toy story is also nice :-)|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	Monster's Inc. ;]<br>  oooh and i have to agree Toy Story!<br>  never gets old :D|`|AA10744842	toy story is my fave pixar movie ,hun.|`|02405b4ea4b4a3e2fdaf4ba004553c8caa	My vote goes to Toy Story.

uy6sBhipaa	Your spork is my spork, Now and forever. What ever words you speak, I internalize and obey. Although I have been begged many times I refuse to assume the power and authority, my madame. One would have to have underlings in place with minimum IQ's of 90 and common sense. They don't exist so it is not worth the effort. Even spellchecker is denying your authority. Woe is us.  8>}|`|OXleDYVQaa	Yowee I've been looking for that all afternoon. I wonder if I left it in a patient?<br>  <br>  Anyway I can still take over the world. I got all the keys to all the Meds lockers.<br>  <br>  It really is a cool invention, and I wonder why it took centuries to develop it? It stabs, it scoops, and even though it doesn't crawl on its belly like a reptile, it gets the job done.<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|YljbIqskaa	Yes <br>  That was the day of the bake sale.<br>  We had made tiny plants made of fluffanuter and gram cracker. <br>  If it weren't for that punk pugesatony Phil and the kleptomaniac rug munching meal Worms.|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	yea<br>  <br>  but pinky got in the way.....<br>  as always|`|rcx668lgaa	Oh baby...my kid did take over the world (read middle school) with a spork.  He made them into spikey haired people.  It was all fun until some kid (not mine) tried to attack a teacher with his spork person.  My kid caught detention because the sporks were wasted.  I called them art...some were really cool.  Anyway to end this long story on the last day of school the kids stuffed all of the sporks that they had collected into one of the lockers.  Sometime over the summer they really pissed off some janitor for sure.<br>  <br>  Thanks if you read this long answer...Naka|`|bjzlgPWfaa	Yes........... today I would have been INVINCIBLE.......... if I had not dropped the mashed potatoes I just made.<br>  <br>  LMAO @ Naka......... great story!|`|xREMTWGJaa	me and my spork are inseparable. i can't rule the world w/out it!!!|`|U5hxXYOQaa	Admit it, you want to spork me.<br>  <br>  It's OK, they all do...|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	spork or no spork, I can barely run my own life.....I don't need to be taking over the world|`|lGSUToFQaa	yes i do all the time it sucks, i have a spork you can borrow

I really prefer fresh from the shower.  But I love perfume on a woman.  Peace to you GEM.|`|bjzlgPWfaa	Naka beat me to it.......... you try it first, if it works, give the word.

olyKkxHYaa	yess. very dif thoughts haha,|`|oQrIn41zaa	Yes, a child might think nothing of it, or just three men, cartoon men, ion a, cartoon, bathtub...however an adult might be like 3 gay or straight men in a bath together, naked, doing things....lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Kisses on FRYday PPl.<br>  <br>  London<br>  <br>  lol, WTF was that about? ah well...Edward Cullen will always make it better. TEAM EDWARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [x]|`|eFoTrRm4aa	Yes, children are immature. <br>  I should know i used to be one!<br>  Adults are usually more mature to not giggle, whereas a kid is not|`|SvyTtFIBaa	yeah, as a child it was funny, but now when I read it, I get heebie geebies and think Brokeback Mountain.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Quite different really.|`|LmARYQxcaa	3 men in a tub?  My first thought would be eenie meanie miney moe.<br>  <br>  <<< one of Princess' contacts.|`|qe8dOJqGaa	3 men in a tub would pretty much describe some of my contacts fantasies.... <br>  <br>  i'm just sayin'|`|b8e2bc9f3753405233ebcc96825942cdaa	I can see your reasoning, but i don't think its occurred to many people,,,lol.|`|8CUfDxRtaa	Look into the origins of "Ring Around the Rosie" and see if it's kinda disturbing to you being sung as a child's rhyme.|`|f9No4eRBaa	I never thought about this rhyme until I read your question.<br>  <br>  I would venture to say with all the political correctness being shoved down our throats by every social, political and cultural group, this nursery rhyme could become "history" if examined under a micro-scope.|`|QLOCznKTaa	Yeah it is...a child might think of the 3 Stooges or Ed Edd and Eddy in the bath tub together...but adults will think of 3 grown men naked, in a bath tub together, doing things that I can't say on here|`|fHgbL046aa	So true. I also heard there is a book about  nursery stories that are graphic and violence, and they modified for children. Obviously not good enough|`|x2rmsjIXaa	yeah, and one guy beats his meat.. another's into candles...
efiIKVmbaa	CAKE!<br>  yes, that's the band's name.|`|pj02ePxAaa	i like paramore, but i think that my favorite band is either linkin park or the fray. they are really great! ?|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Aerosmith.  I've been a fan for 20+ years.  My first concert ever was an Aerosmith concert.  They rock like crazy and put on a helluva great show.  There are a lot of great memories with my friends tied to their music.|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Between the Buried & Me because they are very close to their fans. They are dedicated to them and they are dedicated to pleasing them with their lovely music. :p<br>  <br>  "The end of this song [Foam Born] is basically saying thanks to all of those who enjoy the music and lyrics we create with each record. A lot of bands take their lives for granted and forget that they are here because of their fans. Thank you."<br>  <br>  -Tom Rogers of Between the Buried & Me|`|9fZfwfe9aa	Paramore!<br>  They Rock!|`|NREqhragaa	idk.. the used...<br>  cause their different.. ;P|`|wvH6xzqjaa	Mine is Paramore and the reason there my favorite band is because its the only band that leaves a smile on my face 100% of the time & there songs i can relate to especially my heart.|`|KjRQysyZaa	Oh gosh I can't decide. Either...<br>  <br>  Oasis-because they're amazing, and not many people like/know their music nowadays<br>  or<br>  The Killers-because I can listen to their songs 24/7 and love every single one of them|`|58eHufb3aa	idk im stuck between<br>  Late of the pier, We smoke fags, and We are terrorists<br>  reason: they're are unique and make the sickest of the sickest beat i ever heard in my WHOLE life. Honestly, i luve them soooooo much.|`|FRf0MlWWaa	OMG I love Paramore too! I love them because I can relate to the lyrics :) and..basically everything about them :)|`|b6jt2eOtaa	The Killers. There isn't really a song I don't like by them.....|`|41S75G5Eaa	omg  i LOOOOOOOOOOVE paramore   xD<br>  but i love the jonas brothers a tiny bit more  =]|`|iQ7ubBAfaa	Insane Clown Posse<br>  <br>  MMFCL|`|0uDuXHtcaa	Paramore and Three Days Grace.<br>  <br>  MY GOSH they rock.|`|rzpPGmzfaa	My favorite band is Owl City at the moment. I like owl city because Adam Young sings, like, clean and fresh music compared to all of the other music i've heard. It doesn't even cuss which is nice and kind of refreshing, and it's not perverted or degrading like a lot of music is. Idk how to explain, but if i'm upset and listen to owl city it always makes me feel better.|`|7MDwQ669aa	I would have to say it's a three way tie. <br>  <br>  Hollywood Undead, it's great music to jam to. <br>  The Spill Canvas because their music is a-freaking-mazing. <br>  Ludo, because everyone should love them. <br>  <br>  :D|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	You spelled favorite wrong.|`|Ut0RiC2uaa	godsmack|`|Z0XR4F0vaa	Blink 182- their accents rock|`|kLlA2JTjaa	Coldplay and Take That

0utZQuyeaa	The lyrics! (:<br>  <br>  'Cause sometimes, songs with a good beat have horrible, meaningless lyrics. Its not always true, but still.<br>  <br>  The lyrics are actually the first thing I notice in a song. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=av4ahBGQshM&client=mv-google&gl=US&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=av4ahBGQshM...</a><br>  <br>  ^^Favorite song at the moment. :]]|`|HNmKgYnUaa	The music is what gets you interested and then you actually listen to the lyrics and it draws you into the song even more.<br>  <br>  Like for Tokio Hotel, the music was just so amaziing and then I heard the lyrics and i couldn't stop thinking about them and uhm ja its been 14 months and i wont ever stop loving them.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	For the lyrics, the music and the passion that is behind it when you hear it sung live.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	music|`|qLhtnommaa	the lyrics (durch den Monsun)|`|e7c28740060350d2f181d79ca9b56dffaa	both|`|nmDbEgXQaa	Actually, I have one favorite song for the music and one for the lyrics! =D|`|Vn4LctUlaa	Mostly lyrics, but it wouldnt be a song without the music part.|`|6WPQxzDTaa	i'd say the lyrics becuase if there is no lyrics it's just the music and is no longer a song|`|6ibEeEZSaa	the lyrics.<br>  most of my favourite songs have ingenous lyrics,<br>  beautiful.|`|iegRymuraa	The lyrics, always the lyrics. It's something I can easily relate to.|`|DbIL3BItaa	Both equally.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Both<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ4dtYIsDS4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ4dtYIsD...</a>|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	Both|`|hpenz9hdaa	My favorite song for the music.<br>  <br>  But I usually like lyrics more.

5Djus4DCaa	aww.  that sucks..  we had a to tornado here the other day and I was scared to death.  I love thunderstorms though, but when it starts to get real windy and you have a tornado watch, that is when it is really scary. It will be alright.  Look at how many times it has rained that hard.  You will be safe.  :)
DhUMjZxtaa	yes, it's pictures people create and draw so its art on the skin|`|IGCZq7BXaa	i hate tats cause why would you mark your skin..|`|TZw9Q7pOaa	No I don't.  I bet most regret having them at some point.|`|50UbJp14aa	Yes i do, coz it involves drawing|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes<br>  <br>  i have 6|`|toLCaFc9aa	Yes, there are some that are really beautiful, but I think I would never get one, they are not for me. But they look nice on some people.|`|i3pF86HNaa	yes, because its an amazing talent that not everyone in this world can do.|`|3eKaATFtaa	Def|`|70kJJJ7uaa	Absolutely yes. Some I've seen are scary evil to outright HOT! Beautiful! Sexy! Woah! Cool! Awesome lookin' ART! ON! SKIN! OuCH!|`|6mBpkt3Daa	yes but NOT when it's on someone's skin :)|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Although I personally am not a fan, I do consider them art. If you put that design onto paper, it would be considered art right? So why not on skin...|`|AA12187799	yes,I design my own|`|jsCjGUPuaa	yes its art just on your skin and not on a piece of paper|`|VoKzvoxKaa	yes<br>  <br>  it expresses|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	It can be art, but not always. There's always people that have stupid drunken tattoos they regret or don't even know what they are, but more commonly i'd say yes. A lot of people use their body as a canvas to tell stories, remember people or events. It's often a really nice form of art if the tattoo is thought out and means something. Some people would disagree because they don't like or believe in tattoos but historically and even with tribal people they have a lot of meaning and expression behind them, so they'd be just as much art as anything Van Gogh or Picasso did on canvas.|`|YaFKI2lxaa	No|`|WCNsmyZBaa	Chyea,<br>  Its a painting<br>  but its on skin not paper|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	In a way, yes. If it looks good..<br>  I don't like big tatts though, I think they just ruin the body.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|fS9K5xnBaa	I sure do...i dont know why i just do..|`|vnkrIa69aa	yes... if its not distrubing its actcully coolio<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?FÎ±Ð¼Î¹?y Guy Ñoxs? ã?|`|VQPgNedQaa	i like tickling people|`|d9iXONYsaa	Yes, in the same way that the paintings for sale in the parking lot of the gas station can be considered art.|`|ixixbQTWaa	yes and a very difficult one because you can't remove it|`|63GTeVXWaa	Of course, its expressing the person's personality|`|lkX9RszWaa	Yes, when they're creative.  A naked lady splayed across your arm would not be art.|`|gPtU4vvgaa	Yes, because not everyone can do it. Plus someone took the time and effort to make it look nice.|`|ei6JS0B6aa	Definitely. It's just inked on your skin, instead of being painted on paper.|`|TcuRYwiwaa	Yes, it's a form of expression.<br>  <br>  It's just like painting a picture on a canvas.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	on some people they look good, on others, eeewww|`|sav5bgzsaa	some because it expresses how a person feels and see things|`|4PCLUlwUaa	yes i have a tattoo's and i like them each one has it's own meaning to me and i would never put a man's name on my body i have my kids names but thy are my kids and all ways will be so it is up to the person  if thy wont one are not every one has there own answer|`|eXPBp6vZaa	fun cool awesome i have like 10 and im like 43 it expresses the way i feel its my way of art but i dont allow my kids to get them because i dont want them to be like tamra barneys son ryan from the real house wifes of OC i got them like 20 years ago  when they werent born|`|7N0sY0pLaa	Yes.. well, like, a small one, or a couple on the arms or legs.<br>  I'm planning on a butterfly tatoo when I'm 18 on my wrist.<br>  <br>  But all over your body, though. Thats... just. Ugh, to me. x3|`|JQmH9UUwaa	It totally depends some tattoos are work of art and others are just plain stupid like if it has a meaning and is good quality then it is art if not its probably stupid|`|IKUrjzucaa	not really|`|srjPOxW7aa	When I was a teenager I did, because I wanted to express myself, but as an adult I don't I feel it's a scar on my skin I want off!|`|vWXSQDWlaa	in a way|`|8974ab84bf2fb9e7ec31bc60afebc1bbaa	NO!<br>  <br>  It is neither attractive, pleasing nor painless.<br>  He or She is not worth it. It is expensive to defile your body. <br>  DON'T BOTHER|`|pTDHiydcaa	yes cuz it is like drawin and its probly really hard to do|`|FmWx4Osuaa	yes and no<br>  only if theyre pretty tattoos|`|IcYXQlf9aa	when its done artfully, I do|`|z1ZSiazQaa	no not really<br>  to me pottery painting and drawingg are ways of expressing yourself and its a ugly thing on your body|`|NNX8Qu5Taa	permanent art.|`|kGmv4ikLaa	Of course.<br>  <br>  It's not much different than, say, a drawing. It's just on flesh, that's all.|`|jYk8QS3baa	some cute small ones look artsy but not the head to toe ones|`|sXv6hH6maa	More like graffiti <br>  :P

Same goes for fishing.I think that killing a beautiful Blue Marlin or swordfish to put it on your wall is terrible,but to go fishing for trout,bass,etc,to put a meal on your table is fine.|`|QaEZd14Vaa	I hunt for fun...it is an addictive sport.  Spending hours/days tracking and looking for sign in the wilderness where you can't drive a truck to the animal.  Spotting game and trying to sneak up on it.  I also love to fish.  But I also eat what I hunt.  I have not bought meat in over 3 years.  If I can't use their meat I donate it to soup kitchens and such.  I do catch and release while fishing and only keep enough for dinner/lunch when camping.  Though I am not a lake fisherman and can't just sit for hours waiting for a bite....boring.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	My dad sadly hunts to eat the animal! yuck, but when I go fishing with him we always catch fishes over 60lbs so we let them go! but one time my dad caught a 328lb bass.|`|30Q1007vaa	Not against it, I just think its boring as hell|`|8SKpsVG7aa	yes to kill an animal and put it on your wall I don't agree with that|`|Tj2xROpwaa	this might be hypocritical but i am very against hunting and fishing but i eat both game and fish. i believe it's the fact of actually killing and destroying their life rather than having someone else do it.|`|HctybHFvaa	i have no problem with hunting / fishing for food, but overfishing and overhunting is bad.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	I am NOT against hunting or fishing.  Since biblical times, humans have been hunting and fishing "for food".  Now, additionally.......<br>  <br>  I'm against skinning an animal for the fur ONLY, or for ivory.  A "trophy" issue doesn't make sense to me either.  That is definitely wrong and it upsets me deeply!  <br>  <br>  My son-in-law is a hunter and fisherman for the "food" ONLY.  He made the most amazing venison taco's that I never thought I'd ever enjoy....but did.  So, he hunts for the right reasons.  <br>  <br>  Additionally 2nd...........If we didn't have hunting "for the right reasons of course" animals in the wild would wind up killing each other for food, though some already do.  But, they would do more of it due to overcrowding.  So, I can see the reasoning why there is a hunting season, versus a non-hunting season.  There are rules in many states for hunting times of the year.  <br>  <br>  The idea of sport fishing annoys me very much!  I watched it being done, and it makes NO sense to me.  Why catch a fish, put them under the hook, and then release them??  Makes absolutely NO sense to me.  But, who am I?  What do I know?  Maybe I've just not been given a good reasoning why this is done.  <br>  <br>  So, those are my views on both matters.  <br>  <br>  Have a good day, from Pilot and I.|`|IWRgKjm2aa	I agree with you, I mean fishes are our food and its a serious cause :)But hunting animals for fun is a very immature thing.

For food, then that's a different story.<br>  <br>  I think killing animals for fun is cruel. <br>  <br>  I am a meat eater because I kind of need meat (the fact that I am under weight and get colds easily). I like seafood, chicken, turkey and beef. But I eat it for my own health. I wouldn't kill and animal for fun though. I think that when people go fishing, then let the fish go back into the water is cruel, and a waste of time.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	I'm a catch and release fisher.

We are hunters and killers. When put in the situations we revert back to primal instincts.

A very outdoorsy fishing and hunting state.  We fish and hunt for fun, but it does have a purpose. When fishing yes we let a lot of the fish go, but we keep some if were wanting to eat that particular type of fish, a really large one we'd get mounted, but the fish would still get eaten, mounts can be made from accurate measurements and pictures so that the fish isn't wasted and it's to remember that fishing trip. As for hunting a lot of times we "hunt for antlers" We don't eat the deers head so we hunt for a bigger older deer. The meat is always eaten reguardless of what size or gender deer we kill, but often times we hunt for a bigger animal. To us it's fun, but we never kill something to just leave or waste it. That's just wrong and any real outdoorsman would be against it.|`|3YydMgt0aa	Yes, I'm against "Hunting for fun". They also do horrible things to the animal while it's still alive.|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	I agree. I have no problem with people hunting or fishing for food. I have fished for food and I have helped my dad clean deer he has shot hunting. But killing animals just for sport seriously disturbs me. Isn't cruelty to animals supposed to be a sign of a future serial killer? Not saying that all hunters who go hunting for sport are current/future serial killers but I definately would think twice about associating with someone who just really enjoys killing things...|`|FAlZFYwnaa	I agree with you completely Southerner.|`|NTrBagbHaa	im not. my dad has ran a successful hunting and fishing shop for many years and has always looked at hunting and fishing as a reason to be outdoors. Really are people going to start this its wrong to kill innocent animals...yall need to carry that crap to the people who kill other people thats something to ***** about! Honestly, freakin cave men did this crap fooooorrr ceeeenturrries! did they start little cave man groups and stomp around with freakin signs made of stone? NO!  so what do you know WHY its no wrong to kill deer and fish smart pants? to answer my question its because they are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY over populated! statistics say for every 1 acre there are 20 doe thats just doe not including bucks. as far as mounting these animals what the hell how many belly up fish do you see in the river quite a few if you go to the river a lot. my dad hosts 1 fishing tournament a month for 7 months out of the year and we have 100+ boats and 2 men to every boat. there is a 5 fish limit to every boat and there's a 12 inch size limit. all these fish are kept in live wells and are weighted and released back onto the water. By the way do you not realize that 70% of the world is made up of water? some fish produce 250-400 eggs THATS NEARLY 400 FISH COMING FROM 1 FISH. please if the freakin cave people did it then why is it such an issue now it got all of us here!|`|2qDvXCX2aa	Not for food but for sport yes.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Killing an animal for sport is pointless. Killing an animal for food is different its natural for humans to eat meat to use the pelts not to waste the animal.

An animal shouldn't be put to waste.|`|DPPW93JFaa	im agaisnt hunting for fish|`|44L2Sploaa	Putting fish back in the water is called catch & release. And they're put back alive and swim off.<br>  <br>  Is it cruel? Probably. A hook in the mouth hurts? They say it doesn't but I don't think they asked the fish. <br>  <br>  Still, fishing (tournaments, etc) is a huge business. <br>  <br>  The only hunters I know of do eat what they kill.|`|FmWx4Osuaa	im against it cuz its sad|`|M4uOXNShaa	I am against hunting.

Hunting is not a sport that all people do for fun. A lot of avid hunters will hunt because they like to eat the meat.

026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	I sometimes read them but I basically take it with a pinch of salt. I say this because the readings cannot be the same for every single Gemini, Capricorn or Aquarian etc. across the globe.|`|GuROHA5Kaa	No, I don't.|`|IUiLJDaJaa	To a certain extent yes... i don't let it determine every thing i do though.|`|PoNMnNPyaa	nop i don't!|`|KhPJIyXhaa	Never. I will read them just for fun. It's kind of funny when it fits your life and it's kind of true to your situation, but I don't take it seriously.|`|t8SCvpgfaa	I read Horoscope section but I don't believe it|`|3lVuNfLMaa	I DONT BELIEVE IN THEM....WILL READ IT AFTER THE EVENT THOUGH AND LAUGH MOST OF THE TIME AS ITS NOT TRUE|`|AbDAdrXkaa	i read them sometimes but i never believe in it :)|`|h00bqU7baa	Yeah in a way but they rig them so they make sense to everyone.|`|atJxwFssaa	I don't.

Last week my horoscope was exactly true. It said that I had a project to do and I must finish it, however much I won't want to and however much I'll try and put it off. And this was true because I had an RS essay I needed to do that I had been putting off for 2 weeks and had to be in on the Monday! And other times it has said stuff about friends that in some sense has come true. Weird stuff, but I'm starting to become really superstitious!   :)|`|DwCDaJXzaa	NOPE, NO, NEVER! they are a waste of time. why?. because they ain't TRUE. they are just stuff a Randomer wrote and there are different webs about horascopes.

They are too generalised the only way they would work is if one twelfth of the world's population. were all knocked down by a truck on the same day.|`|xUOmDc26aa	I occasionally read them but never take them seriously.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yup i do|`|p0c4mek6aa	I do and I don't. I read them just to see if there is any relevance in what is there. Some days it can hit the head of the nail and I think, "oh, that's exactly right". But there's other times where it's just a load of rubbish.|`|nwdwKnS7aa	No. I find Astrology interesting & sometimes correct, but I am skeptical that the placement of the skies has anything to do with something as abstract and impersonal as life.|`|qWqg7vFJaa	No I dont Sasha...If I had ever believed then I would be the worlds richest man , the luckiest and so on...<br>  I have not read one for many years now..|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	i hardly ever read them and I only find they r good on the personality of a person|`|XAioHGKbaa	Yes I do|`|MtANnIlfaa	No im not ignorant|`|ZYJdpXEBaa	I dont believe in them hun..but i have to say i do read them|`|po0b0L0Laa	no, I think they're interesting though.

First off, my deck is missing a few cards so this is entirely supposition. <br>   We're afraid to let people see us cry, because in our minds it makes us seem less masculine. I was the same way until a special woman taught me that it's okay, but we still don't like to do it in front of other guys for fear of being teased. We whine to the women in our lives because they are what brought us into the world, raised us and kissed everything and made it better, some call it a mother complex, or whatever the technical term is, but in our often muddled brains, we often feel more comfortable going to a woman with our problems because they have the uncanny ability to somehow make things better and they listen. If we go to another guy, he'll say stop being a wuss and get over it - which is, in most cases, the right advice, but women have that nurturing instinct and we just feel more secure whining to them. They can kiss the boo-boo's and make them go away - or at least make us believe that it did in fact, go away.  We like playing with toys because we are gaining weight, losing our hair and slowly falling apart - the toys help us retain some faction of youth. Women just seem to get more beautiful as they age, we turn into slugs. Yes, we do look silly playing with toys and doing things that we should have stopped doing many years ago, but it makes us happy and (sometimes) keeps us out of trouble. I've always preferred women doctors simply because they actually listen and answer questions, whereas a male doctor will breeze into the room, not let you get a word in edgewise, then fly right back out the door as though he were much too important to waste his precious time listening to you.  I don't know if any of this makes sense, but whenever I have a problem, usually emotional in nature, I will run to my mother - or that very special woman who always know just what to say to make me feel better and make the boo  boo go away.|`|crBmcntyaa	sometimes a good wii is all we men have left in us............<br>  <br>  dont deprive us of that too!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Im always getting told off for wii-ing all over the house.... i wanted to start wii-ing in bed too, despite the warnings that its dangerous to my health and i need to have break from wii-ing every so often and get out more.......|`|2wptPP8xaa	Whats wrong is men get punished for acting like men.

(:<br>  <br>  - You get to learn new things/material than you had in Elementary School.<br>  <br>  - You wake up and go to school later than high schoolers.<br>  <br>  - You have different teachers, when you had only one or two in Elementary School.<br>  <br>  - You can bring your own lunch and people won't think it's weird. I think in high school, people think it's cooler to buy lunch. o.0<br>  <br>  - Lots of memories. Even if they're bad ones, you can learn from those experiences to make more of your life stronger and successful.<br>  <br>  - You can be friends with just about everyone and it's more fun that way! :]<br>  <br>  - You worry so much to fit in, but no one really cares. (=<br>  So be yourself, and people will love you for who you are.<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  - People tend to want to be in the 'in' crowd. With that said, you lose friends at times.<br>  <br>  - People change frequently.<br>  <br>  - Cliques.  people don't allow newcomers in their groups.<br>  <br>  - You can get caught up in drama and love issues. Tell your sister to take care of herself. These kind of "problems" aren't necessary, and it will waste a big part of your middle school career. (x<br>  <br>  - Teachers can be mean and picks on you a lot.<br>  <br>  - There can be homework and projects in different classes due at the same time, which is really stressful.|`|y2MMr8m7aa	Junior High sucks all around.<br>  <br>  Good:<br>  Better food<br>  More classes choices<br>  Not as structured days<br>  More freedom<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  DRAMA!

fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	I've used up all of my sick days ... now I'm calling in DEAD!!<br>  <br>  To answer your question?  I lost any and all respect for Cane the day he had sex with Amber, and then callously threw her away like trash!  How can you listen to a woman beg you for forgiveness, grab her like you're gonna make it work, and then act so cold afterwards, and for what?  It was all to make Amber grab on to a little bit of hope, then make her feel cheap afterwards.<br>  <br>  I say he's getting back TENfold what he gave to Amber.  He got his heart ripped out, twisted around and broken with Lily, and now with Chloe and Cordelia ... everything done to him, already done to Amber!<br>  <br>  Payback's a b*t*h!  <br>  <br>  Let's just hope this doesn't turn into yet another Cain and Abel episode!!!|`|sVlFl2dbaa	You know, I actually USED TO really like Cane. <br>  <br>  As of lately he is just pis-sin' me off! Who does he think he is ..... Like Billy said ... You paid for a few doctor visits and a crib. GET OVER IT!!! <br>  <br>  It's Billy's baby .... Cane needs to back up. <br>  <br>  I understand his pain, but seriously he is going about it all the wrong way.<br>  <br>  I hope in one of these fights - That Billy will Knock his *behind* out! He is starting to act just like that miserable mother of his. Jill! Ugh - I cant stand her .....|`|uVwPykXlaa	im so sick of him,but we going to c fireworks.<br>  billy is going to marry chloe and cane to marry lily.<br>  cordelia is in he middle of a nasty custody fight..<br>  round 1..who will win.|`|gakFjZfdaa	took the words right out my mouth...he is just a tad bit boring...|`|Apd3fHJTaa	they've made cane out to be "the good guy" he's hiding something. i think there's a side of cane that is bad! hope it comes out soon. remember the mysterious phone call he made when dna tests for him and jill were being figured out? he's up to something and buying his time. I like Billy and Chloe together. I like Cane and Lily together. I can't believe Cane proposed to Lily though- considering he's still married to Chloe.|`|420e0e2496807e15c86ec78f8ff9a5b3aa	With the storyline about Jill not really being Mrs. C. daughter I don't see him really lasting but we'll see what happens.  But is it just me or is he the most gulible man alive!  How do you get fooled twice by a woman? LOL.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Definitely. Cane's character in the beginning was better. Kind of roguish. Made you think at the beginning that he was conning Jill but they didn't follow that storyline.|`|lv1dT7BQaa	Cane needs to move on He is a total control freak,Hes bullying Chloe around and treating Lily like crap.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Actually l was so sick of Chloe and Billy and their childish games with Cane that right now l hope they end up together and raise baby Cordellia like ADULTS! Cane Rocks and l'm GLAD he knocked out Billy!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i agree with you. i used to like cane though before the baby was born but now he is a jerk. i can't believe he would try to take the baby away from her mother. that's mean and cruel. ok, chloe and billy should have told him that he wasn't the baby's father along time ago and he should be upset or mad about it but he needs to leave them alone and get his own family.

q02UN23aaa	im 22 and still terrified to be outside alone at dark. <br>  <br>  i think i am a product of too many scary movies when I was young.|`|qpmGLd7laa	No, you're okay.  I know a lot of girls who say that they won't ever sleep on the side of the bed near the door.  I mean, no matter where you sleep, you're still pretty screwed in the case of a robbery or whatever they're afraid of, but it's comforting to know that they're a little further away.  Just like it's comforting to know that your closet is closed.

DjifToZgaa	June 1992, Chevron - Barstow, CA.<br>  <br>  People are gathered all around the men's restroom, some taking pictures.  I figure someone has passed out.<br>  <br>  Lo and behold I discover the grisly truth.  A loaf the likes of which has not been seen in decades stands a full 4 to 5 inches above the toilet seat line with a tinge of blood on top.  Standing full upright, it was probably 24-28" in overall length.  A true monolith, a Wonder of the Natural World.|`|JPDxyTT3aa	Imagine a young me, 16 or so, sitting in a fast food place with a couple of my friends, out of the corner of my eye I see an old woman stand up and practically run like her bums on fire to the ladies room. Not really thinking much more about it we forgot about it and continued on. Before leaving I realized I needed to use the restroom before departure, so naturally I headed to the ladies room. Stepping into the bathroom I encountered a smell that one can only describe as âdeath by poopâ. The stall in the bathroom looked like it had been hosed down with doo.. it was oozing from the seat, down the side of the toilet, on the walls of the stall, on the back of the toilet, on the tile.. every where. It was horrifying. <br>  <br>  I also, went to a inner city school in Tampa- located conveniently in the hood. There wasnât a day that went by, that those toilets werenât overflowing with used pads and tampons and even the occasional hair weave. Being a female myself I could deal with that. But it was the day that I walked into the bathroom to find a young female pooping in the sink that I realized exactly how much I hated that school. She will forever be burned into my memory as âThe Duku Queenâ. Those were the days.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Mopping up puke covering the walls and stalls in a bar/restaurant where I worked.

Somebody had the hersey squirts all over the stall. Yes even the walls of it of the stall.

I was mortified.|`|WcsYK6sYaa	once wen i was like 10  i went to a public park on a field trip and there was a bathroom i still remeber how it looked and its smell but whats really stuck in my mind about that bathroom is that there was a homeless lady washing her socks in the sink at the time.|`|qe8dOJqGaa	I was working at TGI Fridays as a waiter, putting myself through college...<br>  <br>  I was asked to clean the womans bathroom at closing... so I did...<br>  <br>  In one of the stalls was a bloody maxi-pad stuck to the side of the toilet with some stray pubes...<br>  <br>  The poor bus-boy had to not only clean that up, by my vomit...as I hurled everywhere....|`|qSI38GAXaa	this is NOT a fond memory, but it is memorable:<br>  <br>  a couple days ago i saw a girl doing lines of cocaine off of the sanitary napkin receptacle in a public bathroom.

EFOBeGu4aa	Because if your concentrating on what other people think about you you don't have to think about the really tough things in life.  Everyone deserves their 5 minutes of fame, but get over it.  Expand your horizons.  Think about something besides how you look or what people think of you.  Ever consider charity work or just helping someone that needs you.  You'll be remembered much longer for a kindness than what kind of clothes you wear or what cute thing you came up with to say at a party.

Qu7GIg6Haa	See if you can find some background info on the lady and whatever organization she says she represents. Have an adult with you at all times if and when you meet with these folks. Do NOT pay them any money, that is a dead giveaway that it's a scam.Do NOT go off anywhere to strange locations for photo shoots unless you bring some adults with you. Make sure they are legit.

SkFgDxpEaa	nope. its a huge success for me. cuz idk but you must love parties where ppl slur when talking to you, or vomiting all over the place cu they had too much to drink|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Not for some people and some parties! I have been to a lot of parties in my time though and everyone is trashed and the party sucked big time.<br>  <br>  I am too old for parties now. <br>  <br>  Go and have a good time for me, will  ya?<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|VFEZFanIaa	A party with no alcohol isn't even a party.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	no, alcohol is not always the center of attention|`|G1lSbvAQaa	No.  If you have to drink to have fun, then you have creativity issues.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	Yes, because you're relying on alcohol to have fun.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Not everyone drinks. Some are Baptists like my Mom was and I never saw her have a drink in her life, and she enjoyed a lot of parties in her life. Also, some people do not drink because of their medicine. My son and my daughter in law had a huge wedding with zero alcohol and they just served punch because of their church and beliefs. So, you do not have to have alcohol to have a good time!|`|AA10838250	can be, but more so with alcohol|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Not a failure...but I haven't been to many "fun" parties that were "dry." (That's no alcohol for the youngsters...)|`|lgIuhKN4aa	No. You don't need to drink to have a good time. :]|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Yes.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	hell no!!<br>  <br>  you just need to invite wittier people|`|pyTsW5c3aa	i mnow one thing if it is i wont be there .//|`|AA10269742	not for my friends and i, we dont drink (and yes we are legal)|`|uqLUKbMbaa	Absolutely not.  Just the opposite in fact.  Too many people rely on alcohol to get the party going.  We have some excellent soirees with nothing stronger than lemonade, tea and coffee.  We find that what is important is the people. I have been parties where is there is alcohol and that is what I heard talking.  Not the real people.|`|wzNABeYZaa	No<br>  <br>  People -good company  make a great party|`|d60e8f20b683cbea453ebac252df94f5aa	Absolutely not.  My hubby and I prefer not to drink, we were both raised by alcoholic fathers and we detest drunks.  Don't get me wrong we will have the wedding toast or New Years toast but that is about it.<br>  Most of our friends can take alcohol or leave it. We have had many house parties where no one drinks and have had a great time. Fun is what you make it and you do not need to be under the influence of alcohol or pot for that matter to have a good time.|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	Of course not. Lots of parties are done non-alcoholic.|`|nYwoC1Lmaa	upto you, I think a Party is all About the People and Not the Booze. <br>   What if you have the Booze and No People Then what ???<br>                              Back to Square One, Law Professor|`|YKbiJADQaa	No way, I think its better, No fights, No barfing in the toilet, No people falling down stairs, No Beer spilt, No Cops to the door, and No holes in your walls. So if you want all that be my guest.|`|XuGFt3boaa	I guess.|`|yyLv2PlJaa	nope.  i don't drink, so i don't care|`|IkWcwsj8aa	no, no one likes a drunken fool|`|iTa38Xkdaa	Nah, I don't drink alcohol so a party without alcohol is good for me.<br>  <br>  :D :D|`|greVjlVpaa	maybe|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	Nope!<br>  When i go to parties without alcohol, they turn out to be really fun :)|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	I don't think so...but tons of people do|`|MmR9LeLhaa	no.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  more like<br>  EPIC failure. :(|`|oqUci1MNaa	uhhhhhh no.|`|8xEBheQsaa	yeah. unless everyone's naked.|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	no but it depends on what kind of party it is|`|inMfHLWoaa	No! People will be able to at least remember what they did...|`|nG2Q1NVjaa	No definitely not.<br>  <br>  I've been to some really sick parties that didn't have any alcohol. It's more about the people you invited. If you invited a crowd that doesn't know how to have fun without booze than the party could theoretically do pretty bad. But if you invited people that just came to party it should go fine.<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|3dtbclWPaa	no i don't think how much booze is at a party makes sense for it being a failure or not<br>  <br>  partys fail with booze all the time.  and some partys without booze succeed.  actually maybe the number even higher for without booze.  i'd bet it was higher<br>  <br>  ps:  that creativity issue's is so true.  but there's some people you maybe be partying with who you would rather be drunk with believe me|`|f5mwd3yHaa	depends whitch kind of party|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	Yes, it is, sadly, because then there is no fun unless you have something better to do like laugh at someone... or play a game... or spin the bottle... and such... but watch how much you drink.|`|VYJH0pAoaa	Not at all|`|hZ3PBybXaa	It depends on the party you're looking to throw. Not every party has to have booze everywhere, if you tell people there won't be booze and that's what they expect when they get there, how could it be a failure?|`|hLQa3VtYaa	Not if you have drugs|`|6Nuaqihpaa	No.|`|K9DBEeu2aa	no not at all. some of the best party's i went to did not have alcohol. you dont have to be drunk to have fun.|`|LbJqU82waa	being sober for 6 years now, a party with no BOOZE IS A GREAT ONE, DUMMY! AT LEAST NO ONE DIES AFTER DRINKING  AND DRIVING,  IDIOT!|`|nBjvf8Kqaa	yes always|`|wGCCMjVsaa	a party with no alcohol is called a morgue|`|5OgCrE3Yaa	Nope. I don't drink, as long as you had fun it isn't a failure. And no...alcohol doesn't always make something fun.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	that cant be a good question to ask I am of age and i dont need to drink to have a good time Im crazy without drinking|`|MFAMzb6waa	no not at all, all you need now is good music and food|`|jCeylLsIaa	tha depends on your attendees. children's parties don;t carry booze but they'r enjoyable to both kids and parents..|`|vPD4s1pMaa	nope|`|3lYGhDSLaa	No, but without hotties it is.|`|8AgGbXLuaa	no but it depend on ur friends|`|mmks8Dyuaa	Haha well. it depends.<br>  whta kind of party ya'kno?<br>  unless your underage or don't care for drinking it's not a failure :P|`|NBDQRBvzaa	yes unless u can make it fun|`|akEmR9Npaa	and if there isnt any drugs there then it is a fefersher failure.|`|jeYyydb0aa	It's a social club like bible reading, knitting, and chess.

Good Luck Kiddo.|`|yZAcwN3haa	call ghostbusters<br>  <br>  1-800-555-2455|`|dC6DX99gaa	maybe you should call the police for this.you know that saying "theres no such things as ghosts"? well its not true.there are actual videos an photos of ghosts! one time in my house i had the door closed but not in the fully closed way.so i couldnt see outside and then when i was gonna get up to grab something....the door opened a bit.there was no wind and my brother was across the hall! so im like"what the...?" it was scary.if u feel like theres a ghost call the police then maybe they can call some people who no how to handle ghosts<br>  ur a kid right?so then tell your parents. they could do something about it! :) thats like the best solution.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck! ?|`|xuM1avMIaa	You should take pictures of all the rooms in your house first. When the pictures come out, you will see how "Kayla" (I think it's more likely that the ghost is a man because he/she tried to hold your hand, and he probably thinks that you're some girl named Kayla) looks like. Then contact some paranormal researchers / ghost specialists and tell them about the ghost. Or you can always get a priest to bless the house. It seems as if the ghost is harassing you, since you got scratch marks all over your face and hands. I think you shouldn't provoke the ghost, because these things always make things worse. You should try to remain positive the whole time - remember, there is happiness in everything, even in the darkest of times.|`|UoDtGtiLaa	who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!! :D<br>  <br>  lol seriously, call ghost hunters or a priest if you are into religion, whatever will make you feel better|`|CZ8szX0jaa	ask him to come down and join you.|`|AA10632588	Tell your parents, try to really convince them.  Ask them to call paranormal investigators or something, or to move. Try to tell the ghost that he/she is dead and needs to move on to the next place. Keep very positive thoughts and imagine yourself surrounded by white light.|`|mAlvOFnWaa	Have you talked to your parents?

2VqpmyNfaa	yes, his deep voice would do excellent as an opera singer.
vDSNG6d3aa	First of all, keep in mind that this is a long learning process and don't expect all tension to melt away immediately. As you improve as a singer your tension will disappear as a consequence. But here are some quick fixes to start getting you on the right track. Check out my blog at www.klausgeorg.com as I will be posting something about singing every day.<br>  - take deep, solid breaths--a strong, supported stream of air creates the pressure you need for singing without needing to tense the neck and jaw<br>  - focus on singing comfortable middle voice notes as relaxed as possible--and insist on perfect. They should be steady, flexible, possible to sing on any vowel and any volume. Don't practice high or low until you feel that the middle is perfectly comfortable.<br>  - try wiggling your jaw side to side on a sustained note or even while singing a song<br>  - "unhinge" your jaw like a yawning motion. This should neutralize the jaw tensing muscles. You can achieve this by using your finger to press your chin down and back--gently. If you're doing it right it will feel kind of like you're trying to bite something large but your jaw is slack. Try singing a little. You'll feel you have to make some internal adjustments (in the back of the throat) to sound good--this is correct. Try to let the adjustments happen instinctively and naturally, and focus on the jaw staying slack.<br>  - make space between your top and bottom molars (back teeth) by pushing your cheeks in with your fingers on both sides. Be careful you don't do this too much--it's just to find the position.<br>  - move your head side to side while singing to eliminate neck tension. You'll generally find the motion "catches" or "stops" at some point--that's a point of tension. Work through it.<br>  - sing very fast scales, with all the notes blended, sliding together. Generally the voice will relax when you make it move quickly. Use a metronome or metronome function on a keyboard to keep increasing your tempo.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Use your chest muscles!  Also, you may be singing out of your range.  That causes tension when I sing.  Try singing lower-pitched music.|`|xm0FdVwGaa	Use your diaphram. (stomach muscles). And sing as though the sound was hitting the top of your mouth scraping your top teeth and shooting out at the wall infront of you in a strait line.

CrAwmz65aa	Two of my favorite medleys are The Artist's Quadrille by Johann Strauss and the Unbegun Symphony by Peter Schickele.  It takes real skill to compose a good medley.  I know, because I have tried.<br>  <br>  In The Carnival of Animals:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carnival_of_the_Animals" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carniva...</a><br>  Saint-Saens slows down the tempo of Offenbach's Can--Can to simulate turtles.<br>  To simulate an elephant, he borrows from the Dance of the Sylphs from Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice . (The Wikipedia article is wrong here.)  Gluck wrote the melody in a high register to create an ethereal effect, but Saint-Saens rewrites it for the contrabass.<br>  He makes several quotes in the movement entitled "Fossils," including his own Danse Macabre.<br>  <br>  In the first act of Puccini's La Rondine, a male character names some famous historical and fictional heroines whom he would be attracted to.  When he mentions Salome's name, the orchestra plays the title character's motif from Strauss' opera.<br>  <br>  Someone wrote to the Ann Landers column, complaining because her husband insisted on standing up when the US National Anthem was played in a movie.

After posting this first one, will have to retire for a nap: which I usually do during the afternoon; have been computering all day.<br>  <br>       This is in response to your question posted within the context of your answer to my question about "composers whose music wears well, and those whose doesn't"; regarding whether or not I've listened to other generes of music besides classical.<br>  <br>       Yes, I have: one could hardly go out nowadays in public without being exposed to what's currently popular: the only thing I've heard(don't know how current)I cared for, was a band called "Credence Stillwater"(?) - or something like that: forgive my ignorance. <br>  <br>       I just can't abide what's called "metallic"(?), hard "rock" or "acid Jazz": I just want to run screaming the other way.<br>  <br>       Having spent my later childhood years and entire adolescencee on farms in rural Arkansas, exposure to country/ blue grass/then current "pop" music was unavoidable.<br>  <br>       Some of my favorites(retained)from that era(if I recall correctly), were "Rock Around the Clock", "Splish Splash, I was Taking A Bath", and "The Ode to Billy Joe".<br>  <br>       I guess I must be some kind of an "anachronism"; love some of the pop music of years ago; like this one, "Fever" by Peggy Lee(she must have been ancient by this time: God, all the "make up"):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YU0xnTOktQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YU0xnTOk...</a><br>  <br>       Or the theme music for "Peter Gunn", by Henry Mancini(too loud for my taste; might want to turn the volume down):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcflCzZlLcQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcflCzZlL...</a><br>  <br>  Be back later.<br>  -----------------------------------<br>       I'm not very good at what you're asking for; certainly can't compare with what "suhwaha-" submitted - very impressive.<br>  <br>       Wagner used musical quotes from his "Tristan" in his "Meistersinger"; but guess that really doesn't qualify here.<br>  <br>       And I think it was - not sure - that Humperdinck pointed out to Wagner, that a particular passage again in "Meistersinger", sounded as if he, Wagner had lifted it en totto out of/from C.O. Nicolai's "The Merry Wives of Windsor".<br>  <br>       I know that back in the baroque and probably on into the classical period - if I'm not mistaken - it was common practice for composers to borrow themes/melodies from each other's compositions, and incorporate them in their own: and this was done on a regular basis - again, if I'm not mistaken.  J.S. Bach, a thief?<br>  <br>       I better stop; as I said, I really have no talent for this.<br>  <br>       But an interesting question; thanks for asking,<br>                                        Alberich|`|dpYMlxA4aa	You need to listen to Sinfonia by Luciano Berio:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZEvfp0gWFc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZEvfp0gW...</a><br>  <br>  there are over 200 quotes ranging from Hindemiths Kammermusik Suite, to Monteverdi, and even some Sam Becket mixed in there.<br>  Though Sinfonia and the Folk songs are the only pieces by Berio I know of where he borrows music from other composers.|`|AA10125474	It the finale of Shostakovich's 5th symphony,there is a section in which he quotes the love theme form Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet", but in a distorted and almost pathetic manner.  It's effect is just the opposite of Tchaikovsky's, projecting (at least to me) a feeling of bleakness and sorrow.<br>  <br>  Brilliant.<br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|hcNXuFCJaa	Tan Dun's youtube symphony quotes Beethoven's Eroica Symphony (his 3rd symphony).  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqiro1kdRlw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqiro1kdR...</a><br>  <br>  Beethoven gets quoted a lot.  Handel quoted other people and infact he was charged with plagarism (I don't think he was convicted).  One music historian said What Handel borrowed from other composers, he repaid with interest.

WytfaeWeaa	A cold compress such as an icepack or a bag of frozen peas should be applied to the affected area for 20-30 minutes in order to speed healing and reduce swelling. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Wrap the icepack in a towel.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the bruise takes up a large area of the leg or foot, the leg should be kept elevated as much as possible during the first 24 hours after the injury.<br>  <br>  <br>  Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be taken for pain as instructed on the bottle. Avoid aspirin because aspirin slows the blood from clotting and may, in fact, prolong the bleeding.<br>  <br>  <br>  After about 48 hours, heat in the form of a warm washcloth applied to the bruise for 10 minutes or so 2 or 3 times a day may increase blood flow to the bruised area allowing the skin to reabsorb the blood more quickly. Ultimately, the bruise will fade in color.|`|nZXLvfDoaa	hold ice on it for a good 30mins too an hour then cover it with ointment|`|MHazHRGRaa	ice|`|MMYY2cj9aa	I got cleated too a couple weeks ago playing soccer, and we were going up to this tournament thing so i wanted it to go away.

vxQEqHvzaa	Well, I took piano lessons for three years (age 7 to age 10) and eventually quit. Now I write my own music.<br>  <br>  Anything's possible.|`|V7WyjxUSaa	I think it is possible. & the fact that you took lessons gives a higher chance of you being able to play again. My sister never took piano lessons and she could play numbers of music. n_n<br>  <br>  And I agree what Josh said. You can also watch youtube videos. People make tutorials.|`|rV4uJVWmaa	I did, just by playing by ear. You bang around on that thing long enough and youll figure it out.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	no.|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	Yeah you can!

8TxaOzrCaa	yup....couldn't agree more, not suitable for any one under 16 years....of age...need to be with parents, but i dont know how can any parent sit through with their kids watching these strong sexual contents.... i was near a family of 5 with 2 to 3 little toddlers...and behind us was a little girl about 4 years old, luckily they left after an hour into the movie...but the other family stayed.... it was the most bummed out feeling i have ever felt in my life....those kids needs to be at home watchin NEMO....lol.... but with all seriousness, it's a rental......it could be better..............|`|zCcOznNyaa	"Watchmen" is not in any way inappropriate or stupid. What it is however is ADULT. This is a movie like an "Alien" film. Little kids should not be watching it. I use "Alien" as an example because saying that "Watchmen" is inappropriate because it is a comic book movie like "X-Men", is like saying that "Alien" is inappropriate because it is a sci-fi movie like "Star Wars". Superhero movies are a genre just like science fiction, action and westerns. And comic books are a medium just like film, tv and novels. They do not reflect on the content in any way. "Watchmen" is a fantastic adult movie... go watch it, just don't take your kids with you.|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	Don't be offended, but in case you didn't notice, it was a rated R movie.  Kids should not be in the theater unless they're with their parents, and I wouldn't take my little kids to see that.<br>  <br>  Contrary to the previews you see, Watchmen is not a typical movie about superheroes.|`|xFox739uaa	I knew it would be stupid! I've haven't seen it, but just watching the trailer, I knew it looked stupid. Sounds incredibly inappropriate!|`|FxxkgIPxaa	1) There shouldn't have been little kids in the theater. Parents should do a little parenting before carting their children off to the latest diversion from their child-rearing obligations. <br>  <br>  2) 'Inappropriate'? What's inappropriate about it? Appropriate means " especially suitable or compatible : fitting <an appropriate response> <remarks appropriate to the occasion>". What is it that it's not fitting for? <br>  <br>  PS: For once they made a movie that catered to the real fans and not to the casual movie-goer. They have He's Just Not That Into You for people like yourself.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	There is a reason it had an R-rating.  The parents of those children should have pay more attention to ratings.|`|AbRfd29Haa	"Watchmen' was extremely true to the graphic novel by Alan Moore. This was not a book for children, this was a novel for adults that happened to be done in graphic form. <br>  <br>  The only inappropriate thing would be the parents who let their young childern into an R-rated movie. ANY R-rated movie. As far as R goes, this was a pretty tame film. <br>  <br>  And yeah, this isn't "Superman".. Watchmen in a complex and multi-layered story. The graphic novel is the only "comic" on Time Magazine's list of the top 100 novels of the 20th Century. It's a work of literature, not simply a comic. And yeah, it's dense... you can read and re-read the novel and get more out of it. <br>  <br>  The movie was extremely faithful to the novel.. perhaps moreso than any film yet made. Don't fault the film for a lack of other people's parental skills. I took my 17-year-old son to the film yesterday.. I made sure he read the book before, and we had a great discussion about the film afterward.. he's smarter at understanding films and literature than he lets on. I left my 15 year-old daughter home...

s359lZj4aa	I think it means how the brunette was jumping up and down and she's been doing this to make every blonde passing by do it as well. Now the "21, 21, 21," I think refers to the number of blondes she killed like she was "21, 21, 21," first but then she started saying "22, 22, 22," because she killed the blonde.<br>  <br>  For example, she would hav started out saying "0, 0, 0," and then a blonde probably came around and did the same thing that the blonde in the joke was doing. Then the first blonde gets killed, and the brunette starts saying "1, 1, 1, 1," and so on.

The day my husband and I moved his mom into her new house (she had 8 Uhaul truck loads cuz she's a pack rat so we busted our asses moving stuff all day) we were starving because we hadn't eaten anything the whole day. At 10pm when we were done, we stopped and picked up a pizza. We devoured the whole thing and it was a large. It was the best pizza I ever tasted just because I was starving!|`|tmer08ZQaa	Yes. The best food, in my opinion, is high quality regular American food.

xrNWeVLYaa	People underestimate teens, they dont think teens have a maturity it takes to really and truly fall in love. Those people are wrong however. It all depends on who the teen is, in some cases the child may be better suited for love than an adult. Everything is relative|`|cLATPkjkaa	Our brains are not mature.<br>  <br>  Therefore, even if we ARE in love, our entire conceptualization of everything will be different a decade down the road, physically. So it wont do us much good in the long run, as society considers love to be a precursor towards marriage and family. What we love as teenagers, we won't love as adults. In that respect, teenage love is useless.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense, I can try explaining again if it wasn't satisfactory.|`|coiGm7VKaa	yeah we can<br>  but most teens have crushes, which we take as "love"|`|Tu7Ec3tDaa	well, we're so young that alot of us probably don't know the difference between love and a crush or a "fling"..=\ theirs alot more out there than you think.|`|53PJZstkaa	most kids i know say they love their boyfriend/girlfriend and dont.<br>  i think its just stereotype.|`|OdovbvSYaa	because they like to feel superior by patronising you.|`|87yovKYlaa	because you aren't done developing mentally, and love lasts where infatuation doesn't. so the things you may love about someone today might be the reason you can't stand them once your mentally finished growing up and your priorities change.|`|ym1oMRePaa	ok first of all its not true, people only say that because they look at all the other teenagers who say i love you to their bf or gf o their first date n then a few days later they break up. how stupid is that? most teens do that now, they are just too infatuated. some think they have fallen in love but most of the time they are just in lust. n i totally believe u though theres so no age for love.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Think about "you can fall in love at any age"... Falling in love is based on a sexual or romantic attraction, you can't properly have that if you're a pre teen. Teenagers can and do fall in love, but the problem is they easily confuse love with a crazy, hormone driven crush because it's all new to them.|`|zNEcCyPUaa	i agree with what you say<br>  <br>  i'm turning 15 :P and honestly i haven't found any even crush-worthy <br>  <br>  but i do believe it's possible to find love at a young age<br>  <br>  they say it's not real because teenagers are rash and are already rushing into things<br>  <br>  they believe that teenagers are delusioned into thinking that a crush is full blown out love when it might honestly be love <br>  <br>  you're right. you're never too young or too old to find love<br>  <br>  now i just need to find mine<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  <br>  Vampire ?|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	Because you are not a fully developed person yet therefore how could you be a decent enough judge of character to understand what it is to truly be in love with a person as a whole?<br>  <br>  When I was 15 I had a completely different concept of love than I do now at 18. Trust me, things change. When you find the real thing, you'll know it. And you wont feel a need to make a parade out of it either.|`|dk8y4eseaa	People think that teens just playing around and are too young to be in a serious relationship because we haven't experienced life like the adults. They either think it's puppy love or sexual..

The reason I am scared of spiders is that when i was going to bed one night, i layed down and put my head on my pillow. Two inches from my face is a huge(no exaggeration) spider.

You have a lovely shower.|`|qKUMaJcXaa	Lol no|`|AA11033942	One must remember that it's all in proportion because if a girl is small and too busty then she would be top heavy and at high risk of not only being unsafe physiologically, it doesn't look nice (see reference 1)<br>  <br>  There are statistics for women that calculate - like the height/weight equation and more recently BMI has been factored in (reference 2) that tells you the best range of sizes for what is healthy and what is not.<br>  <br>  There are some models and actresses that are way too big and look horrible. If curvy = sexy then I'm with team curves. It says that a girl eats well, and had developed well.<br>  <br>  If you question your figure that would mean some one is trying to have a go at you (or if its a female friend, it could be jealousy) don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Team CURVES any day :)|`|kZiT8QJMaa	Woohoo, I love curve women.

Personally, I think curvy is people who are slightly, just slightly overweight, with curves in the right places, and fat is people with loads of fat hanging all over the places.<br>  <br>  I'm on Team Curvy too, because CURVY=SEXY!    :)|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	"Some" people call themselves curvy because they are delusional, or just flat out liars.<br>  <br>  Others are, indeed, "curvy."<br>  <br>  For instance..... Rosy O'Donnell? Curvy = delusional<br>  <br>  Kate Winslet? Holy sh*t curvy....!|`|Hw3n0nenaa	Team Curvy!<br>   People were made to have dimension to their bodies. Your thigh and ankle should not have the same measurement.  Your upper arm should be larger than your wrist.  Some people I have seen on TV look like they would fall over dead if they skipped 1 celery stick.|`|FOeWqr0qaa	Every woman has curves but if someone describes themselves as curvy then they're fat and just trying to make it sound appealing.<br>  <br>  Some people find them sexy but I don't really.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	I haven't run across curvy girls that are fat but voluptuous is another story.|`|A4ofPUnGaa	curvy=sexy|`|cIEpoHb9aa	Well "Curvys" good, but I found that "Thick" is now fat! lol|`|atJxwFssaa	Curvy is very sexy i.e curvy in the right places, not fat.|`|eox05Kghaa	No way!<br>  <br>  I'm on Team Curvy too. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  People just look for excuses to call people fat..|`|cjLxrrTBaa	You're rockin them curves...|`|URjwNyYraa	Oh you bet your a** i'm on team curvy|`|8e15Ty5faa	I'm on team curvy :)|`|c1FAWmbraa	Yess!

Simon Cowell also does X Factor over here, which is pretty much exactly the same as American Idol, and I watch the live shows of that.<br>  <br>  I'm not even sure, because so many celebrities have such cool hair. And it makes it really hard, because most celebrities always have a different hair style. But Beyonce's is the coolest, because she looks great with curly hair or straight hair, with her hair down, or her hair up. Some people with naturally straight hair look weird with curly hair, and vice versa!<br>  <br>  The ugliest star? Aww, that's so mean! Lol, but I know where you're coming from!

A Serious House on Serious Earth.<br>  <br>  How much scarrier is the comic Joker than Ledgers? <a href="http://fc46.deviantart.com/fs41/f/2009/023/8/1/Tony_Daniel_Joker_Collage_by_LikaLaruku.png" rel="nofollow">http://fc46.deviantart.com/fs41/f/2009/0...</a>|`|d55D0Ci4aa	I don't question the why's and how's I just enjoy the movie!!!|`|x2Gl6EM7aa	First of all slow down a bit there. Your thinking too much! Now that you brought it up it does seem fishy and I did think of the school bus scene and why the hell no one noticed but it is a movie. I guess the gotham city residents are dumb or somethin. If you want to get good responses to this post this on www.imdb.com you may have to create an account but it's 100% free. Still though the Joker was still awesome in this movie and it probably had to be the best acting i have seen ever.

And not the loss of jobs, lack of cash and rising prices of absolutely everything?<br>  <br>  Freedom of choice is also an interesting term. Freedom to give everyone around you cancer as well as yourself. Thanks. <br>  If you CHOOSE to spend your money on fags and booze then do it. I'm more concerned by the rising price of food staples, my utility bills and books.<br>  Fags and booze are hardly a necessity.

It is embarrassing. I feel ya. lol But when my parents tell me someones checking me out they don't like it when I pay too much attention about it and if he's a really cute guy they sometimes debate about not telling me. lol Very weird. What do your parents do when you do pay close attention to the guy that's checking you out? <br>  <br>   -Julia-|`|VrY1P59Maa	I'm 14 to.<br>  And yes, it happens all the time >.<<br>  It's like <br>  "Oh he's so checking you out!" <br>  Kinda as if she's trying to be "kewl" <br>  Lmao.<br>  It is embarrassing :P<br>  But you get used to it...<br>  Kind of...<br>  Later.<br>  Or not o.0<br>  <br>  <br>  -<br>  <3<br>  Heather<br>  -|`|BKacbxmiaa	No.  My parents are oblivious.|`|S1KQcCuFaa	No,not actually,I think they might notice,but just keep it to themselves.|`|VCrM51POaa	hahaha<br>  MY MOM DOES<br>  im like ahhh|`|yz2MKjTSaa	OMFG YES.....My mom does and i kinda die inside.....and im like AHHHHHHHHH MOM!!!

kpoPY3ZHaa	not TOO calm but I would be give them an opportunity and wait for them to explain.|`|QWavO7Feaa	like if its embarassing and in an instant and in front of people, i will smack them in the head, but if its for another reason, then i'll count to 10 to get alittle calm then i go up to them and ask them why they did that. (violence is not the answer!)  haha|`|KhPJIyXhaa	I always talk to my hubby about the people that I'm mad at. I never talk to that person because it will probably make it worse and cause more conflict.|`|qpCbeLnHaa	If they're not there...

Only simple things I'll say (like if they ask me a question, I'll answer it coldly, slowly, and give only what they ask). Once they figure out that I'm mad, I'll tell them the exact reason I'm mad, and its their choice for the rest of the road. But I would want an apology and a nice talk about it.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Depends on who that person is. If it is my mom, I call her and we talk about it. If it is my other half, I text and tell him how much I hate him at the moment.lol... Other than these two people I don't really get mad because I care for the two so much that they can unintentionally hurt me. Other people do not hurt me since I usually don't care and do not get mad;-)<br>  <br>  If I have absolutely no access, I Just get busy surfing online until I can get them on the phone and tell them. I usually do not keep things inside...I let it all out and they know it:-P|`|HCHqzkQraa	I don't get mad at people, <br>  but extremely upset, <br>  when they treat me rude, <br>  due to my head injury...<br>  so I've learned, if I'm gonna cry, <br>  get out of their face fast...<br>  and if I can hold it together, <br>  just talk to them like<br>  nothing is wrong. <br>  I find that confuses them more, <br>  and puts me at a better advantage.|`|CfWXgwxBaa	I`m also making death threats and all other sorts of threats.When I`m mad,I`m mad.Literally.I`m a real psycho...|`|S5BkvnbMaa	I make death threats

I mean it really depends how you personally feel about pot.  It is fairly common and some people don't do it but are okay with it.  If you don't like the idea though, you should definitely talk to your boyfriend about stopping or get a new boyfriend.|`|o3pqpKGNaa	it could be the first in a long list of things you don't have in common. i would take inventory and see if the good over powers the bad if so you might be o.k. if not i'd worry a little.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	you probably should care|`|T6WYXtdfaa	if you don't like it, leave.|`|JjTfFD07aa	Uhm....YES!!|`|QH4a4mPFaa	No.|`|tWmibIWFaa	yeah!|`|gUdlaaGwaa	It's entirely up to you. Ask yourself do you like the person he is when he's stoned. Is it taking over his life rather than being a recreational habit? Is he motivated enough to work and keep his relationship going with you? Are you comfortable with his habit? If you answer yes to all this, then there's no problem. If it's no, you must decide is he the one for you.

fP8H3n3baa	The Illuminati and CFR (Centers for Foreign Research) was first outed by Myron Fagan in a radio broadcast in the 1950s.<br>  <a href="http://www.apfn.org/APFN/illuminati.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.apfn.org/APFN/illuminati.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MonNSusdTfI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MonNSusdT...</a><br>  <br>  It's well worth reading/listening to that broadcast because it is 95 percent accurate.<br>  <br>  The CFR began to legitimize itself and its membership expanded to include "associate" like members who have no idea what goes on at the core. On the we, searching for CFR will turn up many, many benign things about them making the true information tough to research. In other words, they have laundered or attempted to wash themselves clean of what Fagan revealed.<br>  <br>  The more recent attention to the Illuminati is primarily due to Dan Brown's books being made into movies. While the curiosity is good to raise awareness, many get the impression that the Illuminati is fiction and try to debunk others.<br>  <br>  In addition, people now understand a little bit more that Skull and Bones was started by the Illuminati. We've had 2 Bush Skull and Bones presidents. And their elder, Prescott Bush, having been Skull and Bones and supplying the enemy in WWII (see Kilgore committee that was released after 50 years in 1997) is a prime example of Illuminati. Clinton being a Rhodes Scholar is in there too and Carter and the Trilateral commission is there.<br>  <br>  To answer your question: the increased awareness, movies and books are stirring people's curiosity.<br>  <br>  Like crooks, l things slip out over the ages because of bragging or other self-indulgence, or death bed confessions.|`|qwInrvUGaa	who said what they are saying about them is true how do we know they are not telling us lies about the illuminati so we don't know what they are really talking about<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now i look like a crazy person|`|rpU209Xfaa	what is that?<br>  and how is this a poll?|`|T6WYXtdfaa	nope.|`|dbkeVZTUaa	Lo siento.

hpenz9hdaa	Haha, I like this question.<br>  <br>  It depends on what caused the nose bleed. If you had a valid excuse for having a nose bleed, like you got kicked in the face or something, then no. But if blood just randomly started gushing from your nose I would probably think you were on heroin or something.|`|xsNHNsJ4aa	yes|`|KhPJIyXhaa	It wouldn't be weird. Hey, things happen in life. If the blood didn't get on your lips then I would kiss you, if it did get on your lips then I would give you a hug and kiss you on the forehead and/or your cheek.|`|YSsfesMyaa	I would feel sorry for you, it would be kinda embarrassing for you. I would kiss you goodnight anyway if I liked you as a person in general.

XmxN58XCaa	im thinking this is out of context.|`|TApVoMdAaa	The guy should call. When my boyfriend calls it does show confidence. It just seems normal for a man to call first.|`|egqveuPjaa	Guy should. It's traditional and gentlemany!|`|MYL2dU8paa	I agree :)<br>  <br>  And it's more romantic when the guys call 2 :)|`|ZYA0Rt7Haa	Yep i agree with you on that one :)|`|4OEl2ZJuaa	i agree|`|TjOQBF9Yaa	i think there's no reason the girl can't call the guy. it shows that you are interested and not afraid to do what needs to be done sometimes. if u like a guy u shouldn't keep waiting. do something urself.|`|bUB8fi6Yaa	I think it should be the guy, but a girl could always do it too if she really wanted to.|`|yz2MKjTSaa	Both Ways...

Get used to it. You are a pretty girl and you should just take it as a compliment and be flattered.
AA11656632	You get lots of sleep.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	i look forward to gettin  staggerin drunk tonight, thats why<br>  <br>  alcohol is the cause of, and the solution to, all of lifes problems|`|yjyBbVJoaa	Yes you are forced to take action and make changes that will make life more enjoyable and fun. I do tai chi, running, painting, reading and writing If I feel like that. And then I feel much better.|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	Money. You have it, then you are happy and awesome. You spend it, now you are <br>  Tired from shopping<br>  Down because you aren't up there<br>  Bored because you have nothing else to do<br>  Dulled because the clothes you bought was last season<br>  And Gloomily depressed because you lost all of your money in this bad economy.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Benefits are that with sadness comes creativity, easier sleep, oh and when you don't wanna do something, you can tell people that you're extremely depressed and can't. For those people that're starved for attention, depression is a good way to get attention, and to get people to feel sorry for them.|`|S5BkvnbMaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It benefits the pharmaceutical companies.|`|xJqb88oAaa	They say that people who are super depressed often don't have the energy to kill themselves and that more people actually do kill themselves when they are coming out of a depression and have more energy (physical and mental).<br>  <br>  So if you consider continuing to live a benefit....|`|dpuY0jWiaa	I was about to make a sardonic reply for laughs and perhaps a few thumbs-up, but decided not to. If you really feel that way, then seek some help. There's lots of it out there, and depression is very treatable in a variety of ways. Hope you do that, and get to feeling better.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	well the benefits can be that as long as you don't go for long periods like this, there will be happy days again, if thats not the case see your doctor he might know of some tactics to help with your depression|`|7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	The only way left to go is up?<br>  <br>  Pre-qualified to become a tax inspector?|`|aixy8EmKaa	probably creativity|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	you get the "feel like Bernard Madoff for a day" syndrome<br>  <br>  sorry thats all i got|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Thats called being Northern|`|CZ8szX0jaa	yes, you don't go out to much and spend all your money.|`|GTBl5IrYaa	you get more sleep when you're tired, which should help you feel better the next day.                                                                         When I feel down or really bored i do work usually around the house, so then i think 'when i have plans, things can't get in the way' or 'that's one less job to  do'.                                                                   when im bored i think 'id prefer this to having a load of work'. <br>  When im depressed i think about what great things there are in my life and what great events are coming up.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|ixweJGk6aa	Hmmm.  I am confused by the question.  I would say that sometimes being alone, listless, tired and the like, all the time, is the sign of a person that likes to be on his own.  As a social creature I would see benefits to this but only on a  point.  Ask again but be more specific.|`|TnF42yfRaa	Benefits?<br>  Yes...get to sleep easier<br>  Because there's nothing to do, nothing to look forward to and you're already tired|`|M8wexR5Haa	yes you can sleep and you doo feel better after that you feel rested unless you drugged urself wit sleepin pills|`|3ETaDj7Maa	undertaker will sort you out when put in box no more assle

The word daughter is not used as a form of address.  Is that what you mean?|`|4YjSx6Fyaa	because the word "son" is more of a saying, rather than the actual son and daughter thing. ?|`|L2dxBXQRaa	The difference is the gender D:

4f38qGoNaa	HAHA......<br>  Im a Leo, and I have to say we are the official nymphos of the zodiac. We live, breathe, and think sex. Without sex we just don't feel complete. We're impulsive, mean, irrational, and even depressed. But once we get a couple hours in life is good again. <br>  Having sex is our golden opportunity to be the friggin star of the whole show. We love to please our lovers, just so they can be even more infatuated when we're done.... a nice boost of ego.... and if you're good, pleasing us makes things even better. It's all about the performance, and then the boost of ego, and then the affection. We are the ultimate lovers... and what is love without sex???|`|ZtnXNbaEaa	Leo have very high libido... they can go horny at any moment of time.... this may sound funny but im a cancer with just mars in leo... and that just changes the entire me... i crave for attention and i get easily attracted.. and i always have this running chemistry to every handsome i talk... if jus mars in leo can make me like this... if just a bit of leo can make me like this... how much a Leo would have Lol|`|L39mQJYJaa	Now wait a minute.................... Countries don't have signs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! And I'm Pisces, I normally like the weird things, but that is just stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|704421a603a4fe92c9798cabe6c43a6aaa	Yes, they have huge sex drives....that is their way of feeling wanted and needed also and important....|`|plBXp91Daa	Yes Leo have a high sex drive but i gues sthere are more people starsign with this trait. And something like cusp doesn't excist you are either a Virgo or a Libra, I made a topic about this and i got that answer that cups thing doesn't excist. But well i'm a Leo and i love sex|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Leo's are the lovers of the zodiac, and can have huge ego's in the sex department. They can also be very very loyal. France & Italy, both known for their 'lover' and romantic tendencies, are ruled by the sign of Leo <br>  <br>  Young Leo's are like lightswitches, on, off, on, off all day long ;-) <br>  <br>  5 times or more a day is not uncommon.

QAwwmDuDaa	Simple,because your young and young girls change their mind constantly.|`|UtzALxfjaa	ha. that explains your avatars name. <br>  <br>  i used to love a guy. then i stopped loving him because he got into meth, drugs and crap. i started to care about him so much. i offered to help him get to rehab and i was there for him.<br>  i didnt LOVE him. but i sure did want whats best for him. therefore i CARED.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	When they love you, it's like a romantic type of relationship. If it's that they care about you, it's that they love you as friends and don't want to see you get hurt or anything. Hence, they care. I feel like that about some of my guy friends. I love them as friends, but I also care about them. :)|`|KhPJIyXhaa	Because she either has found someone else or you've done something to piss her off.

JmzHvt71aa	No, they are a very good band though. One of the greatest.<br>  <br>  Led Zeppelin are the greatest band ever, followed by The Beatles.|`|7ZMXW4jSaa	It really depends on who you are.  Different people like different music.  If the Kinks are the greatest band to you, then that's all that really matters.  There is no official "greatest band" out there, because not everyone thinks so.  There are so many genres and so many different types of people, with their own likes and dislikes, which are not going to be the same as everyone else, and maybe not the same as a lot of people.  It's just the opinion of an individual that counts.  Whatever you think is the greatest band or greatest song is the greatest to YOU.  So you shouldn't ask a question like this.  People who don't like the Kinks are just going to tell you about the bands that they like, which are probably not going to suit you.  I personally love rock/metal and upon hearing the song Victoria by the Kinks for the first time right now, I almost literally laughed my *** off.  I didn't like it at all.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you:<br>  1. Don't ask people online if they think your song is the greatest.  You will probably get more negative comments then good ones.<br>  2. Maybe you have friends that you can ask this question to, or friends that you already know love this band.  Talk to them.<br>  3. No matter what anyone says about your favorite band, be it negative or positive, don't let it affect you.  Stay true to what YOU love.|`|cXngLI3Vaa	No. It was the Beatles for this reason. Before 1964 music was boring, the Beach Boys,etc. The Beatles put rock and roll back again. The Kinks, the Stones, Animals came after the Beatles. I loved all of the bands, but the Beatles were the first.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	No and No<br>  <br>  Bands like <br>  <br>  Coldplay<br>  The Parlor Mob<br>  U2<br>  Green Day<br>  The Hives<br>  Led Zeppelin<br>  Red Hot Chili Peppers<br>  Rolling Stones<br>  Soundgarden<br>  <br>  Are all bands that good be....The Kinks?

dJfvy8Cvaa	An absolutely great book that is being made into a movie is called The Road.  Its a drama thats kinda sci-fi, kinda historical fiction.  Its about a father and his young son and their relationship while traveling through the former U.S. in a post-apocalyptic world trying to find a safe haven.<br>  <br>  It's a great read, I highly recommend it.

Two, actually. I think they'd have a hard  time getting two out of The Hobbit, so they'll probably work parts of The Silmarillion in there as well. It's tentatively scheduled to come out in 2011 - so a couple years to wait. However, it's being done by the same FX people and director as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The guy who played Gandalf has already confirmed he'll be in these movies as well. They better not mess up Smaug, is all I can say! I don't think I have too much to  worry about tho, considering who's working on it...<br>  <br>  Edit: I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy, and I agree with Steve - great read!|`|ss2tjvsXaa	Well, a bunch of books will be made into movies and we don't know what ones are coming out at least not all of them.

Makes me go wtf?|`|4qT0TfMZaa	They always have been, and there's no reason not to continue, except in cases where it's an obvious attempt to imply government endorsement of a religion or an attempt to annoy others.  Just don't go preaching at me or my kids snd grandkids and we're cool.  Capisce?|`|y1TDricRaa	i don't mind them|`|e7c28740060350d2f181d79ca9b56dffaa	dont bother me|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I don't see why not. They're displayed on t-shirts and other clothing accessories and it's not offensive. So why should a display board be any different? It's still not being pushed on anyone and no one is saying you have to be a part of it just because it's displayed.|`|gpON465Iaa	all the better that your love of God is openly displayed for others who may share or learn or become exposed - "In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path."<br>  But with respect to public schools, hide it and it will shine in other ways.|`|IGQw4267aa	Either way, I don't give a shhhhit.

Organized religion creates hatred, which creates wars. Soon, there will be a religion-inspired nuclear strike, so this is the real issue.|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Yes that is part of our whole freedom of speech thing.

Yes.|`|i9SsCOJ7aa	Yes.  The Bill of Rights guarantees both freedom of religion and freedom of speech.  If you don't like the religious symbols you see in public, you have a right to say so, to display religious or anti-religious symbols of your own, or to simply look the other way.  You do not have the right to destroy other people's symbols, as that would be infringing on their rights.|`|QJ17P0DOaa	yes.|`|qlNfbBMvaa	so you mean as an ethical basis? <br>  freedom of religion allows us to do that, but if your asking if we should(which you are) then i would say of course. There is no harm in doing that, unless you don't like religion, which is hardly an argument.|`|AA10081720	To a certain degree..you see them in on top of churches,in panes and in any other place where it's suited. Too press it into places where people find it in excessive is going too far|`|mFSXWmyjaa	As long as it's not overbearing and you're not trying to shove your religion down other peoples throats, then yes, display all you want.|`|2e94b620e41601c4bd618520d6d7b6a7aa	sure as long as they aren't displayed on government property|`|9CeBI6gAaa	Yes|`|FAlZFYwnaa	Yes they should.

It is not worth losing your life to lose weight. She should start eating 4 healthy meals a day and drink lots of water with them. Exercise ever  how little to start with is good. Every day increase the exercise five minutes.<br>     Eat healthy meals and healthy snacks like carrot sticks celery sticks, meals of a piece of meat smaller than the palm of your hand and salad and one half cup of cooked veggies. I bet you that the weight will come off as long as she does not cheat one bit on this routine.|`|70kJJJ7uaa	No baby-girl. U can't live on water alone for a month.

Im 21 year old and a 300 pound woman=problem in todays society and not to mention very very unhealth. im not going to lose the kind of weight i need to lose in 30 days. So i would shoot that part out of the equation. more like 2 years. And its two years being consitent on a daily basis. now i would just change my metabolism myself. instead of my body knowing me as a person who sits around or just doesnt do any activitys i would let my body know to speed up my metabolism and keep there. By doing activities and exercising. I wouldnt go overboard the first month. My body wont be used to me doing anything. i would some exercises that doesnt really over do it but scretches my heart out from time to time. You start busting out with a full exercise at that weight and you are looking for a heart attack.After 30 days i would increase each week. Run (no tread mill) outside. Then i would do a little weight lifting. not to much but enough to increase results 5 times more. Then i would go from like a size 26 to like a size 18 the first year and a size 18 to like a size 12 the next year.|`|Vn4LctUlaa	Hey lisa! {waving at you}lol<br>  Well you shouldnt fast.

"Lisa" should have put down the bucket of Popeye's Chicken and started moving her chub when she hit 150.<br>  <br>  Water only diet - you'd lose a lot, but gain it all back right away. When you dont' get the bare minimum amount of calories your body goes into starvation mode and hoards fat while  burning muscle. This is why so many anorexics are actually considered clinically obese. When their body fat is measured a lot of them, scrawny as they are, are above 25%. Same with bulimics - but they rot their teeth out, too. When you start eating normally again, the weight goes back on at a frightening rate. It's pure fat for a long time, too, because your body is still in starvation mode for a while. So, not a good idea.<br>  <br>  The way to lose weight is very simple. Burn more calories than you consume. Period. That's it. Eat sensibly and exercise religiously. I eat a LOT (well,  I *do* love to eat and I am a chef) but I'm not fat because I jog every morning and then go to the gym every night. It's a choice I made so I CAN eat what I please (within reason, of course). If someone is too lazy to exercise, they'll have to cut their calories to the amount they need just to maintain survival. They'll lose weight, just very, very slowly.|`|AA10244921	Lets pretend that I am Lisa.  I would forget about the water fasting for 30 days and instead would still eat, but would carefully watch my daily food intake.  With fewer daily calories, I would need to be sure to eat healthy foods to get the proper nutrients.  I would start exercising daily, maybe by going for long walks at first, and then would take up jogging once I started to lose some pounds....the main thing would be to get my heart pumping and work up a healthy sweat for an extended time period.  I would eventually want to go for two mile or three mile jogs daily, maybe taking a day off from exercise once a week just to relax.  I might also want to take up some fun new activities to keep from being bored so I wouldn't think about food as often.  With my reduced calorie diet and regular cardio exercise, I'd hopefully be a 5'10, 22 year old hottie.  :-)  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it helps to keep careful track of what you eat in the course of a day.  I used to be somewhat overweight in high school, but managed lose it during college.  I usually have a good lunch and then two smaller meals later in the day.  Like yesterday I had a cup of coffee for breakfast, a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs for brunch around 11am.  Then I had a steamed green bell pepper filled with rice (the rice had tomato sauce and egg mixed in with it) around 4pm and then I had fruit (a bananna, an apple, and a big tomato) and a spoon full of peanut butter for supper after my jog.  I usually try to drink a glass of milk at some point during the day too.  I don't alway eat that healthy though.  I occasionally treat myself to cookies or a slice of pie or things like that, but then only as a rare treat.  I try to cook for myself most of the time too...that makes a difference.  I try to go out to eat only once or twice a month.  I try to mix it up and have different things.  Sometimes I'll have a burger and a beer, or a big bowl of soup for brunch...sometimes a couple peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for my 4pm meal...things like that.  I usually try to eat light and healthy for my 8pm after jog meal though...typically just a few fruits and vegetables.  I typically try to avoid snacks and junk food.|`|zTLCjUH5aa	unless i havea time machine i wont know how much weight exactly but i would think youd gain more weight cus my moms friend is like you and she water fasted for like a month and said she gained 25 pounds =\ i think you should just stick to exercising and healthy eating not fasting|`|naEk1QkSaa	If u r lisa or if it is a friend i tell u or her that it is a bad idea! <br>  <br>  U can get sick because it is just like being anorexic and u could end up in the hospital or even die!|`|GclagLJkaa	I'd say....lisa have something to eat......let's go for a half hour walk each day and you seem like a great person and i am sure you look beautiful to more people that you know!!  ....don't do silly things to loose weight!!|`|UepUqU5daa	I'd gain 107 pounds.<br>  <br>  (I'd use McDonald's water, you see)<br>  :]|`|wvH6xzqjaa	my friend used to be like that he ran everyday ate healthy and he is now 140 believe it or not im proud of him since i was his coach|`|8XEIMuBqaa	ROFL!<br>  <br>  That brought a tear to my eye, especially the Lisa part.

Some women would say a nice dress, a pedicure or even being independent. Find out and just do it. You might even consider taking hormones.<br>  <br>  Dress like a woman if you truly wish to.

7Jex0jRpaa	Actually... I have this really Good book!<br>  With a Realistic Love Chart in it!<br>  <br>  The Same Signs =Made for each other.<br>  Because the Star Signs are the same,<br>  Their Personality may be the same,<br>  This can be good or bad.<br>  <br>  As you know if Two things are alike,<br>   it can go wrong or it can go right.<br>  <br>  There is nothing really you wrong about Two of the same Signs if anything is good!<br>  But Remember even if the guy and the girl was the most incompatible Couple in the world, it could still work! If you work with it.<br>  <br>  Don't let star signs get in the way :(<br>  <br>  Anyway Hope this answers your Question :D|`|WUA5xdI0aa	I can see that some signs attract and some repel.<br>  <br>  Libra's go well with other Libra's, Gemini's (my wife), Leo's (I think???) and Aquarius.<br>  They don't go with Aries, Capricorn and 2 others.<br>  <br>  You should be fine.<br>  I'm 3/10 and she is 11/6.|`|AZsAGSX2aa	This can be a good match you are so close in the "stars" that you should be able to figure eachother out easily since you are so similar.

Nr8ap8khaa	lol well she is the problem - who cares about her and what is wrong with her eyebrows that makes it hard for me not to stare at them all the time. <br>  <br>  Cuddy's haircut is bothering me too. she is pretty with her hair back and long. But I don't mind the adoption. <br>  <br>  Wilson is turning into a whiny little girl about that horrible Amber and i really only like him when he is either being really mean or really nice to House. <br>  <br>  Foreman needs a personality. I understand that they want to make it seem like real life and not everyone in real life is interesting, but if i wanted to watch uninteresting people do uninteresting things i would be throw away my TV and be nicer to the people around me. <br>  <br>  No one knows what is up with Taub and Kutner. though they could be really interesting but they aren't getting any attention because of 13/foreman. Although, Taub needs a new wife who he doesn't need to cheat on and who is willing to have his midget baby. <br>  <br>  i don't mind Chase and Cameron. I'm glad they have smaller roles because they were getting boring and insignificant before the team changed. <br>  <br>  And yes the other guy is right they need more house because there would be no point in watching otherwise.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	Not enough House in the storyline.<br>  It's the is the 13 gay or straight show?

The original 3 were the best. I like House insensitive jokes...and the fact he doesn't follow rules. I was originally drawn to the show because Omar Epps was on it,  I have followed his career for years, and this was the best move he made.|`|ACLIVzy7aa	It's funny without trying to be. <br>  <br>  House is supposed to be this really grumpy, bitter guy but he never fails to make me laugh! <br>  <br>  He's outrageous, sarcastic and very witty.

He never follows the rules. <br>  <br>  He and his boss Lisa Cuddy disagree on everything and want to strangle each other half the time and be with each other the other half! <br>  <br>  The whole cast has a great chemistry and the scripts are interesting and watchable. <br>  <br>  I look forward to House every week.

But I would say, as far as just a single album goes, my vote goes for "Decemberunderground" as I like most of its songs.|`|LehwOrSIaa	My favorite album is Sing the Sorrow<br>  However, my favorite AFI songs are all from Black Sails, Art of Drowning, and the All Hallows EP.<br>  <br>  The Last Kiss<br>  A Story at Three<br>  The Despair Factor<br>  Malleus Maleficarum<br>  A Winter's Tale<br>  Days of the Phoenix<br>  God Called in Sick Today<br>  <br>  However, STS and DU have some AMAZING songs like:<br>  Kiss and Control<br>  Death of Seasons<br>  This Time Imperfect<br>  The Interview<br>  Endlessly She Said<br>  etc..<br>  <br>  However, The Chicken Song is hands down my favorite.|`|o566Wg20aa	i love all albums and songs and my favorite usually changes a lot.<br>  but right now my favorite song is The Missing Frame, and my favorite album would be either DU or STS|`|rag4oABQaa	'Love Like Winter' or 'Prelude 12/21' from decemberunderground.|`|0DGjPqWeaa	For some reason, I like Sing the Sorrow more than Decemberunderground
nElhbdADaa	I don't think that's too likely, since the movie takes place supposedly in the "King Piccolo" saga. We know that he will definitely turn into an Oozaru (big monkey thingy) but as far as a Super Saiyan... I doubt it. Besides, if it's true that they plan on making it a trilogy, they have to keep something nice and flashy for the other parts.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Yes, he actually does. I WILL see the movie, I watched the anime when i was a kid, but I think it'll turn out stupid.|`|YCUJMvWQaa	ah who knows but i cant wait till it comes out it hink its on april, are you guna go see it? cause i mam, i wana see how piccholo is gonna lo0k haha

AA12009809	ROTFLOL!!!!!! I have the same one! Holy Shite! I'm assuming your a senior in HS, so here is what I came up with. Bloom was trying to say that (this is a general idea) Gulliver see's fault in everyone elses way of life, from government to human nature, but fails to see the faults in his own government and way of life. Which in all reality is almost identicle (spelt that wrong, sorry) to every island he went to. Kind of like the whole "what you grow up with is the right way to do things, everyone else is wrong" feelings.. Good Luck!|`|DnDXqFTXaa	You would do well to read the book not watch the movie. The movie is for mass entertainment and children; the book was a serious parody on Swift's anti-political sentiments. Don't be like Gulliver, see more than the obvious. The ruling class of Laputa think they are above the commoners (physically they are). But are they really imprisoned? People running for public office having to do gymnastics and other tricks. Doesn't this sound like today's political nonsense?

3LRhCH0baa	when i was kid, i drank kerosene...they had to take me to hospital, run pipe down my throat and suck out the kerosene...|`|HMhUKAgkaa	When I first went off to college, I went wild. My parents were extremely over protective so I was finally on my own and didn't know how to handle myself. Well, one night, my boyfriend at the time came to my dorm for a few hours. So we had sex but then he had to go home because he had school the next day (he went to a different school). After he left, a guy from one of my classes called and said he wanted "help" with a paper we were working on as a couples project for Biology class. So he came over and we had sex. He left and I went to bed. At 2am a different guy I had met a week before called me and he was a little drunk and he was a senior so I thought it was cool to hang out with him, he wanted me to come over to his apartment (which was on campus), so I did. We had sex. Then I went back to my dorm and my roommate was there packing up all her stuff. I asked her wtf she was doing and she said she couldn't take it anymore and left. We never got along from the first day we moved in together. We never talked again after that and she got stuck with the bill for the repairs for the room at the end of the semester because I was Hall Council President so I was in charge of writing out the expenses for the rooms.

I have a feeling that won't be very long now sadly.  Whatever she decides to do it will be what she thinks is best for her boys because she always puts them first.

qqVcuEB3aa	It's about time he got some credit for the way he's behaved.  From what I've read he has participated greatly in the care of his sons and I think jade has done him a great disservice by trying to portray herself as some hard up single mother raising money for her children because she has no-one else.  It's fortunate there is Jeff because I can hardly picture Jack Tweed as a hands on full time father, I bet within a few months he'll hardly bother with the boys at all|`|6MgjXkWvaa	I think that Jeff Brazier has done the right thing by staying out of the limelight - I think if Jade had wanted him to be with her or the children for any reason over the last months he would have been there.<br>  Its the two little boys that I feel for, they have not been told that their mother is dying all they know is that their mum is really ill, it must be very hard for them.<br>  Yes he will be a single parent at the age of 28 but then there are lots of people that are single parents out there! Albeit in different circumstances!  I am sure that he will cope although I really feel that the children will take quite a long time to settle down after all this is over as they have had so many exciting things going on like jades wedding and the christenings etc and then suddenly mummy wont be there and they will have all that heart ache - I only hope that they will be able to adjust and that Jeff Brazier will have the confidence, love and courage to help them through it all.|`|c793b5f83215cf17d2a9cb8100ec71a0aa	id admire jefff fair play to him  looking aftre kis kids much better thn jack x x x x x|`|LAdyqASxaa	Got to say I'm 100% with Nat here Whip !!<br>  <br>  Exactly what I was thinking|`|AS4pWko5aa	maybe nobody asked him his opinion <br>  <br>  we don't know what he will do when he has full custody of the boys , he may spill the beans for some cash but i doubt it he does seem like a nice lad despite the fact that he left jade alone to cope with the boys and refused to babysit|`|AA10077992	He's been marvellous hasn't he - and I'm sure he will bring the boys up properly and be just the BEST dad - I wish him all the best|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	Yes he's been great by what i've heard about him Whip , must be  hard  to try to keep things sort of normal for the sake of the children throughout it all , I think once you've had children together  the feelings never  truely  go away even if you aren't together , Its going to be hard  for all of them to live their lives without jade being in it <br>   <br>  breaks my heart|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	He does seem to have taken a back seat, and quite rightly too, but I have often wondered why there has been no mention of him and why he has not been in the boys lives more in recent weeks.  I would have thought he and Jade would have wanted the boys to be with their father whilst Jade has been unable to to give them some security and stability at this terrible time.  But maybe he has - we don't know what really goes on, only what the media will have us believe.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	*Dignified silence*  --   yes, couldn't put it better.<br>  <br>  Major i agree - i also have huge respect for Jeff and i'm sure he will step in and be a full time dad when their mum's gone.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	I guess so. I hadn't really thought about it until now.|`|UfRMJheeaa	It's his duty to take care of the boys - he created them.

UnsZKr4saa	A slow and extremely painful evolution, beginning with the dreaded Nu-Metal, then moving onto Metalcore.  Needless to say, I listened to some awful crap.  Hell, I believe Linkin Park were my favourite band just a year ago.<br>  <br>  Then, when screwing with some Youtube links, I heard 'Mercenary Man' by Firewind and was instantly hooked.  Along with this band, I also discovered In Flames (my current favourite band, although regrettably I started with their newer material) and Hammerfall.  However, even then I was a casual listener of Metal, and the majority of my playlist was still full of crap.<br>  <br>  My first realization that Metal was indeed an amazing genre was my introduction to Kamelot's 'March of Mephisto'.  I didn't understand how the use of symphony and atmosphere worked in Metal, but the end result was simply amazing.  The experimental value and the beauty and diversity of the genre simply blew my mind.  I began downloading en masse with the help of Last FM and friend recommendations, and deleting all the generic Nu-Metal out of my playlist.  That's where I ended up today.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	I casually enjoyed classic metal, and thought all the new screaming stuff was crap. Then, Slipknot desensitized me to harsh vocals. I was still a rather casual classic metal listener. Metallica, Maiden and the like. Then, on a whim, I bought Vulgar Display of Power by Pantera, which blew me into next week. I got WAY more interested in metal. Then, within a month, I got The Blackening by Machine Head, and Demigod by Behemoth. Those three albums, I believe, are the ones that made me a total metalhead.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath, 1st song appropriately named Black Sabbath|`|tX9zDvDwaa	haha when i first heard iron maiden - fear of the dark<br>   i became thee biggest metal head ever<br>  thats all i listen too is METAL and alternative haha sometimes :)<br>  BUT MOSTLY METAL!!! <br>  \m/>.<\m/|`|AgQForcYaa	Lessee, two or three years ago, my friend Anthony (major metalhead) was watching some Judas Priest on Youtube at school, and I was like "What are you watching?" and he was like "This is Judas Priest, one of my favorite bands," and I was like, "Cool." Then a few weeks later, near the end of the school year, I was outside, and saw the Metallica logo sidewalk-chalked right in front, and I went, "That's it, I'm picking up sum HEAVY METAL CD'S!!" <br>  <br>  So, right after school the next day, I think, I told my mom to take me to Discount Records, and I picked up Metallica's Black Album (yuck), Judas Priest's "Sin After Sin," and "Unleashed in the East." It was a Friday, cuz I went out to my friend's for the weekend, and I took all those with, listened to them, and was just about immediately enthralled (except for Metallica, which was totally underwhelming for me).|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	Well a friend of mine who I respect very much suggested I get Tool's Aenema, and so I did. I listened to it, and I hated it. But something drove me to give it another go, and so I listened to it again, and again, and pretty soon I couldn't stop. I fell in absolute love, and all of my other music paled in comparison to the standard that Tool had set.|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	My sister listening to Judas Priest's Screaming For Vengance album a miilion or so years ago. Then in 1986, I picked up Master Of Puppets on a whim(remember Metallica didn't have a vid until 88, and hearing them on the radio then was not happening), from there I picked up stuff from Exodus, Testament, etc etc and have been listening to heavy stuff ever since.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I remember listening to "Rust in Peace (1990)" by Megadeth at my friends house when it first came out.   I was around 14 or 15 years old.  That was what converted me to Metal.|`|eEoeURDHaa	Hearing my first Megadeth song<br>  <br>  Last Rites/Loved To Deth|`|7cxA70O0aa	...listening to my older brothers 8-track tape collection in the early 70's...(Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Kiss, Queen, Uriah Heep, and many others)...been a fan ever since...|`|dFacbjIZaa	Hearing War Pigs on the radio over 20 tears ago<br>  <br>  It was a real epiphany|`|AA11430900	When I was 9 my father gave me a Black Sabbath vinyl and that did it.|`|ZDdVXD7qaa	linkin park - album. i guess when nu metal was in. my tastes have changed. it is values they represent through the metal culture.|`|IhDou8ePaa	Listening to Metallica and Megadeth.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Man, I honestly do not remember, but I think it was kind of like this.<br>  <br>  I liked stuff like Led Zeppelin, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, etc, so I was already into hard rock.<br>  <br>  I got Guitar Hero II for Christmas one year, and found out about Megadeth, Anthrax, Black Sabbath, etc through that. I also started to get into stuff like Metalcore with screaming vocals when I heard "Sic" by All That Remains on that game. I had a liking to those heavier bands, and looked up some more. I started to like stuff like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and other bands.<br>  <br>  I wish I remembered a particular moment, but I guess there wasn't one for me.|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Bands like AC/DC, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath and Zeppelin eventually led to heavier and heavier metal.

QK4r41Hqaa	Crimson Spell-<br>  awesome.<br>  I mean, really ,really awesome. HOT "yaoi" moments (the best I have ever seen) and a really good plot.<br>  "In order to protect his people from attacking demons, Prince Val uses a demonic sword and curses himself in the process. He leaves his kingdom to find a cure, and his search leads him to Hallwil, the person rumored to be the only one who knows how to break the curse. Hallwil agrees to help Val... for a price." (credit to bakaupdates for the discription)<br>  <br>  Bukiyou no Sighlent<br>  adorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... So cute XD<br>  I love it so much<br>  And it's really funny, and so sweet i can't take it! CX<br>  Toono Satoru was just asked to go on a date by Tamiya Keigo, but all Satoru does is stare blankly at him without saying a word. The truth is that Satoru is so happy right now he could burst! He's had a crush on Tamiya for the longest time and never thought the feelings might be mutual. Unfortunately for Satoru, his emotions never show on his face and he barely ever talks. Naturally, this causes all sorts of misunderstandings. Will he be able to express his true feelings for Tamiya? Will Tamiya ever learn to read Satoru's expressionless face?<br>  -bakaupdates<br>  <br>  <br>  Junjou romantica is also really good, I'm sure you've heard of that though XD<br>  If not it's reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly awesome :D (drawings are... so so, not very good- not tooooo bad. The anatomy is messed up a lot, but it also looks really pretty O-o very nice style acually, just... kinda off..)<br>  <br>  <br>  Cut<br>  :(<br>  sad, but it was awesome- and I think it ahd a really sweet ending- but it's been a while since  I've read it D:<br>  <br>  "Sakaguchi is in a sexual relationship with his step father that is abusive, but he enjoys the pain because it helps mask darker memories from his past. He then meets another student who also has a troubled background who may be the person to help him stop his self-inflicted pain.<br>  -mangafox<br>  <br>  *checks*<br>  <br>  yup, a very sweet ending :D<br>  I need to read it again...<br>  <br>  <br>  Others, <br>  Kare to Kare<br>  Kiss and Cry<br>  and all of Takanaga Hinako's work.

XD because it has by far the most interesting plot that i ever read. <br>  In the first volume, you might be confused by random inserted short stories other than the main couple, asami and takaba, because the author intended this to be a one-shot originally. But it was received well, so she made this into series. This is the summary: (but it's only the first volume) <br>  You're my Loveprize in Viewfinder: During a routine journalism assignment, freelance photographer Akihito Takaba is captured by the mysterious Asami, a powerful leader in Japan's underworld society. Asami forces his captive to undergo a night of pleasure and pain never before imagined...
pTERJdzQaa	You need to listen to this song:<br>  <br>  It is called "Fighters" by Lupe Fiasco: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOp1R8E4oBQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOp1R8E4o...</a><br>  <br>  Well...I cant really give you a full summary of the deep message that it conveys, because the song does not just give one deep message, there are various deep messages that are in this song.<br>  <br>  For example: A qoute from verse 1: "You dont want them to hear you, you just wish there was a door that would appear that you can go dissapear through, well Im feelin your pain, I was feelin the same, but I said I would never feel that again".<br>  <br>  Quote from verse 2: "I really miss my pops, hope that god watches over him and that hes on top, hope theres no more disease and thats hes all right, hope that hes one of the generals inside the army of the light".<br>  <br>  And the chorus: "When the Fighters are all around, and the lovers are underground, who gone save you anymore".<br>  <br>  A quote from verse 3: "I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners, turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go, holy apartments and the gardens on which the rivers flow, thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles".<br>  <br>  I cryed listening to this song, and It makes me cry every time that I listen to it, The beat even makes me cry sometimes, I get very emotional when I listen to this song, It is very deep, listen closely to the lyrics.<br>  <br>  Please forgive my punctuation...and any spelling errors that I may have made...If you are not much of a rap fan then please at least listen to this song, Its not like the typical rap, this song actually has alot of meaning.<br>  <br>  why I think it is deep: because the song completly relates to my life, well...A great fraction of my life, and my past.<br>  <br>  Except for the Fact that Lupe Fiasco's Father died, and he is paying tribute to him in the song.<br>  <br>  I dont have that in common with the song because my Father is still alive and well, and I am very greatful for that because I have a great relationship with my Dad.|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	"Slipped Away" by Avril Lavigne<br>  <br>  I think it states the impotance of appreciating the people around you and letting them know how much they mean to you before they pass....*sniffle*|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Breaking The Habit.

I live my life by that song.
bnKb7X7Qaa	Erm I hope I have this right, but I think it's about a lover, boyfriend, friend etc who left the person who has been there for them through everything. The song explains that the person who left still has the heart of the one who loves them still..?<br>  Its all just about someone who left another someone and the other someone still loves them and is sad because they gave their all to someone. Err, if you get what I mean ;D

q4XUy0Duaa	Left Eye was a great rapper and definitely underrated, but people will always associate her with TLC, which will always be associated with R&B.  I think that's the only reason her name doesn't come up as one of the greatest female rappers of all time.|`|66fMJo6raa	well i think it was because she was part of a group and not a solo artist,like queen latifah,mc lyte,da brat,missy elliot,etc.,but her raps were very good especially in waterfalls. R.I.P.|`|H4JGMOeqaa	Well she was apart of an R&B group, TLC. People don't like to single her out ..despite her talent.

a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	I think GURU and Primo would both be unknown, the East Coast sound would be completely different, thereby affecting the sound of the South or inhibiting it's creation altogether, Jeru the Damaja would've latched on to either KRS-One or the Wu-Tang Clan as Afu Ra did, Perverted Monks would've been RZA or Allah Math produced, Hot Boyz never would have come out, because Southern Rap wouldn't have anything to rebel against, 50 Cent would've been taken under the wing on Onyx or Mobb Deep, JMJ never would've been shot, but either Havoc or Fredro Starr would've, RZA would've had closer ties to Pete Rock or Prince Paul, KRS would have to call upon Pete Rock or Prince Paul for that classic sound, Illmatic would've been released a year or two later, failing to achieve classic status. . .|`|aJfBtT9iaa	^^^^ lol thinking about premo making chopped and screwed music made me laugh idk y<br>  <br>  Only god knows.|`|l72FO4eMaa	I've always wondered this too<br>  <br>  I think it most def. would be different<br>  <br>  Probably not, I doubt very much that one producer could change a whole state's style of rap, Premo would have blended in with the H-Town movement and probably ended up making chopped & screwed music lol<br>  <br>  See above<br>  <br>  Probably not, because before he was famous he was crashing with Fat Joe, so I think Joe would have made him a name<br>  <br>  That I can't answer|`|3vfrO1bOaa	Personally, if he would had stayed I don't think most of us would know of him. His style is way different from those country cats. <br>  You ever heard that rapper named Novel? He from the ATL and his records don't get that much play like it should, but if he moved and rep NYC that could change the way people see him.

Thinking nothing more of it, he goes home. However, intrigued by the disappearance of his classmate Amamiya, who was also in possession of a Psyren card, Ageha begins to dig around. He soon learns of an urban legend about a secret organization that leads those sick of society to paradise, and the only way to contact them is with the calling card. Intent on saving Amamiya, Ageha uses the card on a public phone. Though, when it is discovered he has a Psyren card, Ageha is pursued; and as he tries to escape his cell phone begins to ring. Upon answering his phone, Ageha is transported to a strange new world where he must now learn how to survive if he has any hope of getting home or finding out the truth behind the mysterious Psyren.<br>  <br>  Kyou Kara Ma no Tsuku Jiyuugyou!<br>  Shibuya Yuuri was a typical fifteen-year-old boy until one day, when trying to stop a classmate from being bullied, he is flushed down a toilet! As he opens his eyes, Yuuri finds himself in a strange land. However, having mistaken it for a medieval theme park, he then gets the shock of his life when he is told that not only has he been transported to another world, but he is also their new king: the maoh. Adjusting to Yuuri's new country isn't as easy as it would seem, especially as he manages to accidentally propose to the previous maoh's son on his first night in the castle! Now, the idealistic Yuuri must learn his role as maoh and prove his worth, as well as trying cope with his easily-irritated new fiance.<br>  <br>  Tail of the Moon (aka: Tsuki no Shippo)<br>  Becoming a ninja is the best think that can happen for fifteen year old Usagi, but itâs impossible! Usagi is only good with herbs and making medicine, she canât even do the basic things all ninjas know and everyone knows that. The only thing is she wants to be a ninja so she can go on missions and leave the small village she has always lived in. One day Usagiâs great grandfather (the leader of the village) tells her that he has an assignment that only she can do, âmarry Hanzo Hattori and bare his childrenâ. Usagi along with Mamezo (a child she has raised from a young age) go to Segachi, the place Hanzo lives at. Hanzo instantly rejects Usagi the moment he finds out why she came, but she doesnât leave and he is made her ninja instructor byâ¦ Her grandfather? With love on the horizon, enemies almost around every corner, a strict teacher, and her ex-fiancÃ© Goemon around all the time, will she be able to do such a treacherous life-long task?<br>  <br>  Nabari no Ou<br>  There are two worlds which exist side by side â the ordinary surface world of the humans and the secret world of ninjas called Nabari. Within this secret world, the opposing ninja groups are fighting over who should possess the ultimate power known as Shinra Banshou. Enter Miharu Rokujou, a high-school student who lives a carefree life and likes to keep himself to himself. Unfortunately for Miharu, his carefree life is about to be over, because within him is hidden the ultimate power and there is no end of evil minions ready to kidnap him for it! Miharuâs only chance of survival is to embrace this mystic world and become the King of Nabari himself. With the help of his new ninja friends, Kouichi, Shimizu, and Kumohira, can he come to grips with his powers or will he fall prey to his many enemies instead?

pLPKo6mBaa	Symphonic metal<br>  <br>  MA: I don't know, it's something about the mix of heavy music with symphonic elements that is really amazing. Add to the fact that there are many operatic female vocalists and not as many harsh vocalists (as compared to, say, death metal) and it just seems like the perfect genre of metal for me. :)<br>  <br>  MA2: Nightwish, although Therion probably does it "more symphonic-y"<br>  <br>  <br>  BA: Good. I'm going out tonight, so it should get better!<br>  <br>  BA2: Seventeen|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	For me it's Deathcore but Folk Metal is a really close second. They are so close together for me that I will do both.<br>  <br>  MQ: <br>  Deathcore - I love the brutality of it. Whenever I listen to deathcore it just gives me the greatest feeling (also known as metalgasms haha). A lot of people hate the vocal style for most Deathcore bands but I love most of it. I really like how a lot of deathcore vocalists can go really deep with their growls but at the same time make it a kind of smooth growl<br>  <br>  Folk Metal - I love the diversity of the genre. I mean, there are so many different kinds of folk metal and each band is very different. Not many other genres you can find something as diverse as a bag pipe or flute in a band along with a lead singer who growls. <br>  <br>  MQ2:<br>  Deathcore - Whitechapel<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9tj-xH1qU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9tj-xH1...</a><br>  Folk Metal - Eluveitie<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtdvoKpLevc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtdvoKpLe...</a><br>  <br>  BQ: It's good now.

9AAGosuiaa	HELLO DAVID V!!!!!!<br>  <br>  very interesting question for us<br>  <br>  I choose the freestyle and the vinyl<br>  <br>  BTW:  your Question reminded me of the early editions of the "like A Prayer" album by Madonna <br>  they came in a Patchouli scented CD longbox that meant the CD continued to have that scent for over a year after buying it!!<br>  <br>  even to this day I'm reminded of this whenever I smell that scent!!<br>  those were wonderful days and that smell always takes me right back!!|`|J7oQV0zPaa	Number 3.  I actually have a Bob Dylan boxset and the CD's have been made to look like vinyl, It does look and feel like a tiny old-fashioned record!|`|Ml22a6evaa	78's haven't seen one in years Dave,I would choose  the Vinyl Disc that would be cool to get|`|un2xSpRRaa	The Vinyl-look disc sounds pretty cool. I like the Freestyle idea, too.|`|FJyqZ3Qjaa	all you songs smell a little darkish mustyish<br>  might i sugest beatles!!! they hava peacy yummy happpy smell!! =)|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Interesting!!   The Freestyle Disc sounds like it would make for an awesome experience.  I might never leave the house if I had one of those.<br>  <br>  I like the convenience of a CD, but I'm kind of a traditionalist when it comes to my vinyls, so the Vinyl Disc sounds very cool.  I actually have a couple of the old wax cylinder records you are speaking of.  My uncle had a player for them.  I also have some old 78s.  It's amazing how thick they are!|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	I really like the Freestyle Disk...but...Who carries disks nowadays?<br>  But a hologram would be really cool!|`|MwSaCettaa	Oooh oooh that smell/Skynyrd<br>  <br>  I would like each & every one of them!!<br>  <br>  ???|`|OXvH2CgLaa	The Perfume Disc would do wonders (and not to mention be totally original) when I'm with my girlfriend, but the Freestyle Disc, now THAT is something I would like to have!!!|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	I would want 4, but more than any, I want #5, a magic disc that gives food aromas.|`|xQL7WWwiaa	Actually, CD-r's that look like records already exist so their not far from that, although it would take a lot longer to produce albums since they'd have to engrave the ridges and crap that record players use to make sound, so I don't like that one, but the freestyle one would be cool, except for when people play cd's in their cars and the perfume one would probably make my head hurt after awhile, so not any of these really. That one guy is right though, hardly anyone uses cd's anymore, just Mp3 players, but cd's are extremely useful if you don't have an Mp3 player or you like to listen to music in your car without headphones since it's hard to find a good radio station to override with that iTrip thing or if you don't have an iPod but a different Mp3 player, or if you just generally want to not use headphones.|`|zRmwEFAwaa	1...The Freestyle Disc. Utilizing the CD player's laser - reading function<br>  , this disc makes full - color, 3 - D images float through the room, as the music plays<br>  <br>  A Beatles concert in your living room. Beatlemania all over again!!!<br>  <br>  (Though number 2 sounds delightful, and number 3 sounds interesting!!)|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	Dave, no question about it---vinyl---RECORDS, so #4; does it get any better?  I don't know if the song smells great, cuz all I can smell is teen spirit or is that myself?|`|AA11430900	None, I own plenty of real vinyl and still play it, I prefer cds and I fill my mp3 from my personal cd collection.<br>  <br>  I certainly couldn't hack number two - perfume makes me sneeze.|`|TaJPujL3aa	Freestyle Dsic sounds really cool...almost like your favorite bands playing a live concert in your living room!<br>  <br>  I can so see the 'porn industry' jumping all over this (no pun intended!)|`|k4GqiB6taa	The Freestyle disc sounds pretty cool!|`|IKCfT9tnaa	not sure about # 2, but all the rest sound great to me!<br>  There is nothing like slipping that needle in the groove and rocking out!|`|kNiWIilfaa	I Think i would rather have the Vinyl disc,Sounds like i could figure it out a whole lot easier.|`|W4BvABL6aa	Hey Dave, I would have to say, depending on the Equipment requirements and cost, the freestyle seems to be the only one that give a customer something new and interesting. And sounds like this is a night time or dark room only gadget. <br>  The smell disc, I guess their will be people that buy that. Their is always items selling that really make me wonder. I say Buy a candle. And all other disc ideas will have a struggle in the market place.<br>  I have been ranting about a usb player made more common. The rant gets into Ipod flooding the market with their adapters. <br>  The final outcome of this in my mind is, Who are the Brain Police?
V1uWwwF7aa	It depends on my mood<br>  If I am looking for a good laugh then Chuck and Larry<br>  If I want a good suspense/thriller then Disturbia|`|hoGpOrOUaa	Wow. Kind of random lol...

94zi1LFFaa	prof Genius, you misunderstood her question.<br>  <br>  Hey Astrol, how's it going? You're fairly on target minus the "is in" & replace with "ruled by". So your second house is in Gemini ruled by Mercury. Or your second house is ruled by mercury. For instance my 5th house is in Aries ruled by Mars.  So my 5th house is ruled by Mars. Back to you, your 3rd house is ruled by the moon. Your 4th house is ruled by the sun. & so on. <br>  <br>  Or lets move over to the planets & signs they are in & the houses the signs are in. Your venus is in Taurus in the 1st house. It could then be said that your venus is in Taurus in the house of Aries ruled by mars. Your sun is in pisces in the house of aquarius ruled by Uranus. Your moon & Mercury are also in pisces in the house aquarius ruled by Uranus. etc<br>  <br>  Using "ruled by" is a very good way to describe the planets that govern signs. & to say "in the house of" is a good way of describing the sign that represents each house.<br>  <br>  ~Peace my pisces friend|`|AA10532675	I understand what you're trying to say.  Yes, if you have Gemini on the second house cusp, it's the same thing as if you had Mercury in the second house, no matter what sign you have on the second.    They will both act in the same manner in general.  Or for example, if you had Cancer on the second house cusp, it would act the same as if you had the moon there.  It's called delineation through correlation.  Now see if you can follow this, Gemini on the second, or Mercury in the second is the same as having Taurus on the third house cusp, or Venus there.|`|dibBENqWaa	I'm sorry , but you happen to be wrong..but how it works is your first house is in your ascendant or rising sign okk? Now suppose your ascendant were Taurus, then if you had Jupiter or any planet in Taurus  that planet  would be in the 1st house. Now in your case your Gemini is in the 2nd house which means any planet in Gemini is in your 2nd house, for example if you have Pluto in Gemini, Pluto would be in the 2nd house.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped answer your question!!!

kK3uyS4uaa	The 1st U.S. Sound Movie: The Jazz Singer (1927) Starring Al Jolson<br>   <br>   The 1st All Color : Gone With The Wind (1939) Starring Clark Gable|`|1IWEKwznaa	Cupid Angling (1918) is the first feature length color movie.<br>  <br>  The first ones in the US were Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, 1936.|`|HzvyASt3aa	The first color film came out in 1918 called Cupid Angling<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cool-movie-trivia.com/.../...wers_08_10_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cool-movie-trivia.com/.../......</a>  <br>  <br>    However, pre-dating those classics by more than 20 years was a 1918 silent film called "Cupid Angling". This is the accepted 'first' color feature-length film, and is also the oldest listed on IMDB as color. IMDB also has heaps of color shorts which predate even this, the earliest listed is from 1902. The actual first filming process was called Kinemacolor, and was invented in 1908 by a Brit named Charles Urban. The more well-known Technicolor corporation was founded in 1918. Prior to 1908, the 'color' movies produced were with hand-tinted frames painted by color artists. <br>  <a href="http://www.cool-movie-trivia.com/Question_Answers_08_10_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cool-movie-trivia.com/Questio...</a><br>  <br>  The "Jazz Singer" was not a true talkie it was silent about 75% with some songs and occassional monologs. The true first full talkie was called "Light of New York" 1928. From the David Hayes news group|`|wHqDY3vcaa	well the first movie made in color was wizard of oz.<br>  Acid trip status,. haha|`|KGG783Seaa	1937
IsxB0Qi7aa	I believe the actresses name is Stacy Haiduk & she will first appear in Genoa City on March 18th as a PR Representative for Jabot. Her character will go by the name Mary Jane. She is going to become Jack Abbott's new love interest.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	I think Dianne Jenkins myself.|`|a4gNLvP3aa	I also think it is Diane.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	No, just that she's supposed to be a new love interest for Jack and she's supposed to be from his past, I don't think they've ever said just who she is supposed to be though.<br>  <br>  From the way they are already dragging that story line out, it looks like it's going to be another one of those story lines that goes on forever and I am so sick of that I could just scream!|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Stacy Haiduk as Mary Jane and for the looks of it she is going to be around for awhile, as her name is now in the closing credits as a contract role.|`|4kuWOZowaa	She is suppose to be there working for victor to play with jack..they said its one of jack exes...not sure what the story line is going to be.|`|6tqGKoREaa	Jack's vietnamese wife whatever her name was.|`|rpBhEjoBaa	It has been along time ago but wasnt Jack involved with LeAnna Love, the writer.. may be her?|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think it may be Diane Jenkins.
qPCXsXfNaa	I have always liked Lily and Cane.  They are so romantic together. I can't wait until they finally get married. I have a feeling that this will be the grand wedding on Y&R hasn't had in a long time,.<br>  <br>  I must say though, I am a little disturbed with the Cordelia storyline and the way Cane is acting about it. But I guess I understand why.|`|6tqGKoREaa	Why is Cane an idiot?   The baby is not his and he has not rights to the baby so instead of jumping ship he is going to pretend his is the father.  The writers have become idiots lately on this show.|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	NNNNOOOOOO I hate the girl that plays Lily I wanted to see where Cane and Chloe's storyline would go, but I guess not now, I think Cane's character would be alot more exciting if he wasnt  with Lily.....can you say boring|`|mXQYbFiiaa	I don't really care whether they're together or not. I liked Lily better with Daniel and with Billy. Cane I've never liked.|`|4kuWOZowaa	I liked them together..but then when lily and billy got together i liked them...and now since her and cane are back together they are annoying..lol so im like in between.|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	IDK, I wish Cane would drop the baby thing.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, they are ok, but annoying..|`|3xOKvjzDaa	i think they are both stupid and very annoying. i cant stand either of them anymore.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I am so happy to see them back together hopefully they will stay together this time and nothing gets in there way!|`|GomZ9oYHaa	NOt really wish Cane would go back to Austrailia.. and Lilly would join the peace corps.|`|Qo6UWVaeaa	no! i hate them both.<br>  <br>  cane needs to leave chloe, billy, and the baby alone.<br>  shes not even his!|`|ow1m3c8jaa	You know I used to really love them together and couldn't wait for them to get back together, but now that they finally are, they are acting like such jerks I can't stand them together.<br>  <br>  First of all, they both need to grow up and stop acting like such babies, and secondly, they need to leave Cordelia with Chloe & Billy, just who do they think they are suing for full custody when the baby isn't even theirs!|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	They belong together, but they need to put the whole Chloe thing in the past instead of getting into a custody battle over a baby that isn't even theirs. Why not leave Billy & Chloe alone & just get married & try to have a baby of their own.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Hell yes,,,,,,misery deserves company !|`|BglekVnQaa	Yeah. Now maybe I an fianally stop hearing Lily's crying and moaning..or at least for the time being.

2c67f64a147b966a432908672ea2402aaa	Yeah I'd like to see that. I like Ryan and Kendall together. It's not that I don't like Zach but I'm getting tired of himtrying to control everything and playing God. Yeah he takes care of Kendall but it's usually at the expense of other people. He doesn't care who get's hurt as long as Kendall is safe. He's self-righteous like Tadd Martin (not sure if that's the right spelling). I hate what Zach did to Josh. He deliverately killed him to save Kendall. I know Josh owe him a lot and that he did him wrong but common, that's not enough to justify killing the guy.|`|3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	NO! They been there and done that! I' am would completely stop watching AMC all together if they put Kendall and Ryan back together because they really don't mesh well. Even though Zach is a liar, both Ryan and Kendall aren't saints either they both have there fair share of dirt and lies as well. I am kind of sick of Ryan, he needs to focus on himself and his kids, the man has to many epic love stories already, he needs a break and enjoy the single life.|`|ADBMrG87aa	We all know that Zack will be leaving cuz the actor is going to join Marty Saybrooke on GH so Yes I want Kendall and Ryan back together; nobody else left in Pine Valley fit enough for Kendall once Zack is gone.|`|xnVXaYT8aa	omg no with a capital NO<br>  how many times can they try to pair them together?? those writers need to stop the madness and introduce some new characters or something cuz its driving me nutso|`|Zss0O9tjaa	Please no, we don't need a Kendall & Ryan repeat. She'd be better off with Jake, lol. Ryan has too many issues and is more dramatic than all the Kane women combined.|`|VU7YIW5haa	ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!<br>  Kendall and Zach should never break up!!!!!!<br>  KENDALL AND ZACH FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10729117	NO WAY! I'm tired of the Ryan drama and the Kendell drama.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	No, I am sick of Ryan, have been for a long time.|`|AA12319351	It seems like they are trying to get them back together,but I sure hope it doesn't happen. How many times can the writers make the same mistake trying to pair those two up? It hasn't worked the last 20 zillion times and it won't work now. Ryan needs to leave the show and give  us all a break and let Kendall get back to Zack  where she belongs. There is no one there that is really right for Ryan and he should just stop messing up everyones life.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	No way, I'd rather see her work it out with Zach rather than be with boring Ryan again.|`|AA12390047	No.  Kendall and Zach need to work at their marriage and raise their boys.  Watching Ryan try to act is painful.  I want him gone.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, I never liked them together when they were the first time.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	no i wish it would have been kendall not greenly i do not like kendall?|`|D3Fyxj0raa	yes because i hate them both and there right for each other

a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Who cares? What's more pathetic is the fact that you think celebrities really read online blogs and hate sites or that they care about you. <br>  <br>  We can hate whoever we want so get over it. And, we're not jealous and we don't have low self-esteem. <br>  <br>  Some celebrities are superficial, idiotic, talentless dumbasses. They deserve to be hated.|`|LvDbD4s0aa	There are a lot of reasons.<br>  For some people, unfortuantely, it makes them feel better about themselves when they pick on celebrities. Whether it's a flaw about the celebrity or something else to any effect, it makes them feel better about themselves.<br>  This could be because they are consumed with jealousy, although they never want to admit it to themselves or other people.<br>  So they go on and watch videos and comment on things saying "Oh my god I hate that stupid retarted ugly pig!" etc. to get out their frustrations and jealousy and to feel better.<br>  Unfortunately, the more they do it, they become even more consumed with their hate and go out of their way doing anything to insult the celebrity. They don't realize how stupid they look doing it.<br>  Some of them also enjoy annoying and disturbing fans of that celebrity, and go on public and popular websites full of those fans, and insult the celebrity, just to get a reaction from the fans defending the celebrity. Then they argue and insult the celebrity and their fans, and are amused on how upset they made the fans.<br>  Once again, they do not realize how stupid they look doing all of this, and using so much of their time just to hate on the celebrity.<br>  These unfortunate people don't realize the portions of their own lives they are wasting. It doesn't hurt the celebrities. It only hurts the haters. So much time is wasted just hating on these celebrities, when the people who do that could be doing so many much better things with their time.<br>  I pity those people.

Most are medium & some are large. Also, muscle weighs more than fat. Some very muscular people are a lot heavier than they look. If your mate is happy & you feel good there is no problem.

LrKCLZF7aa	Wow, This is actually very interesting because if you look at the aspects Saturn is actually a clash at a quincunx but because there are two I have to say that it CANNOT be interpreted as something bad. What we are actually looking at is Saturn in conjunction with the Jup Nep midpoint (since there are two midpoints for every two planets) and Venus is at the opposite midpoint of Nep Jup.<br>  <br>  So with that in mind I would interpret it as control(Saturn) of money(Venus) and long term(Neptune) assets(Jupiter). This is a great Yod to have in a natal chart.

knfX8FWIaa	You take a CD, make a playlist of songs on iTunes, and burn them onto the CD. That's what a mixtape is. Then you can basically give it to someone or keep it for yourself. It can have tons of different songs on it, or it can be themed, like "Sunshine" songs or something.|`|66fMJo6raa	a mixtape is a tape of different songs mixed together, like playing a portion of one song and then a portion of a different song followed by a portion of a different song,etc.|`|905717466a1ce241049a3f2b313be845aa	DJs like Grandmaster Flash, DJ QBert, DJ Spooky, DJ Z-Trip or DJ Shadow, The Avalanches, and Rjd2 have gained fame for creating new songs by combining fragments of existing songs (which need not necessarily belong to the same genre). The resulting remix or mash-up can be seen as an evolution of the mixtape, in that it appropriates existing songs to give them new meanings through their juxtaposition, but does so in a quicker, more integrated style. This practice is heavily derived from the use of song loops as musical backdrops for an MC's rhymes in hip hop music, which is also related to turntablism.|`|Uoiahfhpaa	Your obviously too young to remember cassette tapes.  a mix tape is when you took your fav songs and recorded them all on one cassette tape.

ARGrcebdaa	Battered womens shelters are there to give temporary help and protection to women and their children who have been traumatized by violence in their home.  Giving money to help support these shelters has nothing to do with her going back to Chris Brown.  If you choose not to support them ... that's fine.  Hopefully someone else will donate.  The point is if Rihanna goes back to Chris then she is the one who needs serious counselling.  Love has absolutely nothing to do with it.  Insecurity and devotion to others without getting love and respect in return will only cause her more heart ache.  I wish her the best but if you take *** whippings like that and return to the fool who did it?

LvDbD4s0aa	There are a lot of reasons.<br>  For some people, unfortuantely, it makes them feel better about themselves when they pick on celebrities. Whether it's a flaw about the celebrity or something else to any effect, it makes them feel better about themselves.<br>  This could be because they are consumed with jealousy, although they never want to admit it to themselves or other people.<br>  So they go on and watch videos and comment on things saying "Oh my god I hate that stupid retarted ugly pig!" etc. to get out their frustrations and jealousy and to feel better.<br>  Unfortunately, the more they do it, they become even more consumed with their hate and go out of their way doing anything to insult the celebrity. They don't realize how stupid they look doing it.<br>  Some of them also enjoy annoying and disturbing fans of that celebrity, and go on public and popular websites full of those fans, and insult the celebrity, just to get a reaction from the fans defending the celebrity. Then they argue and insult the celebrity and their fans, and are amused on how upset they made the fans.<br>  Once again, they do not realize how stupid they look doing all of this, and using so much of their time just to hate on the celebrity.<br>  These unfortunate people don't realize the portions of their own lives they are wasting. It doesn't hurt the celebrities. It only hurts the haters. So much time is wasted just hating on these celebrities, when the people who do that could be doing so many much better things with their time.<br>  I pity those people.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	Because we CANT escape them!<br>  You turn on the radio or the tv and there they are!<br>  I do understand what you mean though. I hate going on websites and seeing people hating on celebrities.

But the way some of them ask for it (i.e. Lindsay Lohan) they make themselves targets.

PeuFnqQwaa	Make sure the wires underneath it are not released (loose). There is a lever on the side of the snare that will release it.  The head (skin) may need tuning (tightening). It will sound crappy if it is loose. Make sure the bottom head is not loose as well. You should consult someone who knows how to properly tune a drum kit and learn from them how to do it yourself.

531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Science is not based on belief. It is based on observation and testing. Astrology is based on a bigoted belief that we are programed like a computer the day we are born. No one has control of this and there is no evidence that it is true.<br>  Those of you that paid attention in high school may have heard something called the scientific method.<br>  <br>  The basics are:<br>  1. Ask a question â determine a natural phenomenon (or group of phenomena) that you are curious about and would like to explain or learn more about, then ask a specific question to focus your inquiry.<br>  <br>  2. Research the topic â this step involves learning as much about the phenomenon as you can, including by studying the previous studies of others in the area.<br>  <br>  3. Formulate a hypothesis â using the knowledge you have gained, formulate a hypothesis about a cause or effect of the phenomenon, or the relationship of the phenomenon to some other phenomenon.<br>  <br>  4. Test the hypothesis â plan and carry out a procedure for testing the hypothesis (an experiment) by gathering data.<br>  <br>  5. Analyze the data â use proper mathematical analysis to see if the results of the experiment support or refute the hypothesis.<br>  <br>  If the data does not support the hypothesis, it must be rejected or modified and re-tested. Frequently, the results of the experiment are compiled in the form of a lab report (for typical classroom work) or a paper (in the case of publishable academic research). It is also common for the results of the experiment to provide an opportunity for more questions about the same phenomenon or related phenomena, which begins the process of inquiry over again with a new question.<br>  <br>  Also key parts are the results of the tests must be repeatable by anyone. Because of this astrology can not be a science.<br>  <br>  Capricornus (the real name of the constellation) has been recognized as a goat since Babylonian and Chaldean times. Usually, it is depicted as a goat with a fish tail, which might relate to a story about the god Pan. Pan, fleeing a monster called Typhon, jumped into the river Nile. The part of him that was below water turned into a fish, while the rest of him above water, stayed as a goat.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I do believe it because I had my chart done and it's me.  It's very odd that these signs are all really formations in the sky and that they actually correspond to times of the year when people are born with the traits of the creatures depicted in the sky.  It really is weird.  I don't know how the goat got into the heavens.  Or how any of them, the ram, the bull, the twins, the crab etc.... got there.  But the mountain goat, the symbol of capricorn, slowly doggedly makes his way up the mountain.  He is surefooted and little by little he gets to the top.  And that's exactly what capricorns do.  And people with that trait are born at the time of year when the goat is on the horizon.  And the goat really looks like a goat.  It's eerie.  'There are more things, in heaven and earth, Horatio, then are dreamed of in your philosophy.'  Have your chart done by a professional reputable astrologer with years of experience.|`|e6621be6e31bbf032040e1a9d8957ffcaa	1 Astrology is NOT 100% true, however it is a unique way to find out more about a person. The traits do depend on the persons enviornment and upbrings as well to be totally true<br>  <br>  #2 Astronomers believe in stars and the different shapes in the sky.

I found out this funny joke.<br>  Wanna hear it ? It really made my week so it should make yours.<br>  Girls night out<br>  Two women friends had gone out for a Girls Night Out, and had been decidedly over-enthusiastic on the cocktails. Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.<br>  <br>  The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other. "Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!' <br>  <br>  I hope you like it.

tc5XLjUEaa	I agree with the transformation part. <br>  <br>  Im a Sun Pisces/Moon Scorpio and if I sit back and go through my life I can pinpoint every stage/phase whatever. My entire group of friends are completely different now. Tried college. Didn't work. Joined the military, now I'm seeing the world. There are major things that happen in life that people dont understand until down the line somewhere. Your past doesn't necessarily make you who you are. Its how you change that defines you. Be glad you've gone through much. Cause at the end of your life, which hopefully is no time soon, you'll be able to stop and look back and say; Wow you know what I did some pretty cool things and met some pretty cool people. No regrets. Don't try and predict the future cause its impossible. <br>  <br>  What is a normal life?

To feel how air in your back should feel, bend over so that your arms are dangling in front and breath in deeply, letting your back expand.<br>  To feel your ribs expand, put your hands on your hips, then slide them up to your rib cage.  Breath in deeply so that the ribs move (expand).  When singing, try to keep them in that position longer until you need to air.|`|rooi4xIpaa	The absolute best thing to do is to do a tri-breath support function.  What does this mean?  Well breath comes, in general, from three different locations.  The back, the belly, and the chest.  When taking a good breath you will feel like it is much deeper.  When you put your fingers around your sides and right under your lungs, you will see them expand back.  (this is a slightly complicated thing to describe in a written message)  <br>  <br>  Here are a couple things you can try:<br>  <br>  1. Breath like you are smelling a flower.  This creates a very deep breath that expands around the middle and back.<br>  <br>  2. Breath like you are beginning a yawn<br>  <br>  3. Breath like you are cooling your molers.<br>  <br>  Two and three will give you a much needed boost in your soft pallete most likely (the area that raises when you yawn.)<br>  <br>  So now that you have a good breath, try one more thing.  Keep your chest buoyant; high, but movable.  When you breath out, you should allow you middle to stay expanded.  This is important.<br>  <br>  Also, another simple solution is that you may be adding a lot of "h's" in the beginning of your words.  The "h" consonant is a quick and easy way to allow volumes of air to escape.  Listen VERY VERY carefully for that.  If you do it normally, then you are probably used to it.<br>  <br>  Hope this help!
NvGqiA4vaa	i know it i know it!!!! it was shown on lifetime. it's called "painful secrets", or has another name called "secret cutting".|`|MpGpoxstaa	It sounds really good.  I'd love to know which film that is.  The film containing self-harm I most relate to has to be 'The Secretary', with Maggie Gyllenhall.<br>  U got me intrigued now.  What is that film?|`|oVUOhTwOaa	Thirteen ?|`|uSYo0yZdaa	No idea but it sounds depressing as hell. I suggest you give up trying to find it, go throw on Dylan Moran's 'Black Books' and laugh your *** off instead.|`|b4ZDxiykaa	i dont kno is it that movie speak cuz it has a same concept sord of

I have a Fender Strat...not that great on playing it though|`|Hq7RvcDFaa	as far as metal tone, you will need a different amp not guitar, unless you get a high gain distortion pedal of course.<br>  <br>  fender amps aren't the best for metal<br>  that guitar will work fine for both though|`|7IHxFWzYaa	yeah man. You can change the drive mid bass etc. on the amp for a rock tone. For metal just crank the knobs up. SG's are good for rock.

KSC02NcLaa	If it had been done right from the beginning, all of the Narutards on here would be OP-ards.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	No. Don't get me wrong, I love One Piece, but it's too "different" to be in mainstream with out all the heavy editing. It's what i'd call an "aquired" taste. which actually is most animes, because animes like DBZ are basically excessable to anyone male in the mainstream market, where as a lot of animes basically only suit anime fans.|`|539aSIVtaa	dunno, but i definitely am not a fan of one piece lol kinda looks stupid no offense at all but yeah, i watched an ep on tv awhile bak n i didnt like it really wats so great about it anyway?|`|sdciT470aa	never. i loved one piece. but its not THAT popular|`|3N2ElzcQaa	What do you mean done right from the beginning?<br>  <br>  Its great how One Piece started.<br>  <br>  The popularity would have been more or less the same.<br>  <br>  There's still a chance for One Piece to be the most popular. <br>  <br>  Its basically a tie with Bleach, and Naruto.<br>  <br>  The Dragon Ball series has its own popularity and it rules all of Shonen anime and manga.

Google lemmings.<br>  4. Newspaper coverage beforehand gets assassination coverage if premeditation is factored in.  Murder can be spur of the moment or premeditated.  How important is a life? Good question.<br>  5. Yes, and the plane would weigh more if it wasn't flying. Whose job is it to weigh seagulls? Are they carry on or are they carrion?

76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Of the winners, I'd say CariDee. But I think the prettiest contestant they ever had was Amanda in cycle 3, I think. The legally blind one. She was absolutely stunning, especially after they bleached her hair, which really brought out her ice blue eyes. She reminded me of an Old Hollywood starlet from the '40s, or something. Unfortunately, she was dropped at third place. I thought she should've at least made it to the Final Runway, if not won, which I wish she did.|`|6MgjXkWvaa	To be quite honest I don't think that any of them are that pretty, most of them are just mouthy showoffs that think they are wonderful when in fact they are not - wouldn't it be nice if there were some really pretty people amongst them for a change!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Danielle.|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	ya witney was pretty. i liked yoanna|`|EpGJbHhEaa	Definitely Fredrick....|`|LE09g68gaa	All of the girls are kinda ugly.

AA10795350	It's an incredible movie based on an incredible graphic novel. A complex, intelligent plot populated with colorful, flawed, and multi-dimensional characters. <br>  <br>  A warning, though: It's not a stupid, Transformers-type action movie. You have to use your brain.<br>  <br>  And, yes, there is nudity. One of the characters, a Superman-type being, is drifting away from humanity, becoming colder and more "alien." One of the ways this is represented: he stops wearing clothes, he no longer sees the point. [Yes, the blue-colored character, Doctor Manhattan, is naked.]<br>  <br>  And there's a sex scene, featuring male and female nudity.<br>  <br>  The movie is rated R for a Reason.

You ARE very pretty, and that can be intimidating. ESPECIALLY when the person has a strong personality. I can see THAT in the photos too.  The impression I get is that you can be... My gramma would call it "sassy". That CAN look 'biitchy" to many.   I'd say... you're an 8 at least. Hard to say more, w/the limited view in the pix. <br>  <br>     One thing I HAVE TO point out... Your onyx black eyes are bewitchingly captivating. (a good thing, as Martha Stewart says) young guys your age will be stymied on how to respond to THAT type of attraction.    <br>  <br>     Just be aware of it, and make a point to be more open and approachable, and you'll be fine.

t2LOcPkLaa	House is a GREAT show and I would love to explain it, but there's so much that's gone on so I don't think I could do it justice. I'd suggest reading the IMDB page on House, especially the FAQ section. If possible, rent the first few seasons because they are fantastic and you should see for yourself :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/faq" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/faq</a>|`|3YjHli63aa	i record it so i'm not sure if i watch the episode in order but i know the gist of what has happened...<br>  <br>  first there was the original team (i'm sure you know about) and there was chase in love with the chick for awhile at the same time she was swooning over House. Then Forman didn't want to turn out like house so he quit, then slowly they all quit and he brought them all back at different times. Then they all left again. So he had about 20 doctors that he slowly fired till he got down to the new three. Forman couldn't get another job so he eventually came back to fill in for House when he is dealing with issues outside of the hospital such as his Dad dieing. Cutty has stayed the same other than she adopted a baby girl which took her awhile to get close to. Wilson has women problems and will always stay house's ***** boy no matter what house does to him.<br>  <br>  That's all i got... i hope that is most of the big things... but i'm still watching my recorded episodes so, there might be more to come from House!

ckd18jUMaa	He will not come on to you right away, if he is a classic capricorn!! Cos obviously both his rising sign and his moon sign say a lot about him too. But if he is a classic capricorn he will make you wait, and wait, and wait, while he freaking processes all of the information in his head and rationalizes it a bit more. During the course of that time he will play little games with you and flirt with you for as long as you let him go on with it. Hell he might even back up and then come back again... those are classic caps!! By the time he makes up his mind, with some luck you will still be interested. But when he does make up his mind, if he has decided do actually date you, then he most probably is planning on getting serious with you... and serious the Capricorn way, meaning SERIOUS!<br>  <br>  If his decision has been not to be with you, then do RUN for your life, because as a man he will never say no to sex, but as a classic capricorn he will always stand by his decision lol<br>  <br>  Right caps??!!

YROer9qMaa	I was in the same boat...<br>  try songwriters101 or (what worked for me),youtube singers,i've had a few job opportunities through singers on there,didn't get paid but I loved it.<br>  <br>  You may not want to hear it but you should really learn to sing or produce if you want to get into the business,because artists nowadays want a demo and the demo needs vocals or production to be considered. Don't give up though,being a songwriter is an extreme talent although they are behind the scenes and is the base of the music industry. (plus,songwriters get PAID,lmao,alot more than singers do atleast)|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	YouTube.|`|WnYjLVtdaa	Well..Try facebook, or even Yahoo!answers.
ckd18jUMaa	RUN FOR YOUR LIFE WOMAN!! What the hell are you thinking of doing to yourself?? Really!!??<br>  <br>  I used to date a capricorn man, whom later I found to be doing cocaine. When we started dating he told me that he had done drugs in the past but that he was no longer doing it!! It turned out to be a lie... Drugs mess up their brains so much that their whole personality changes, and they end up by becoming a third of the men they were. this guy became a shadow of the man I fell in love with actually, because of his stupid addiction, which obviously he says to this very day not to be an addiction. Cocaine addicts are usually arrogant pricks!!! Please stay away from this man!<br>  <br>  I mean you at least have the advantage of the guy having been honest with you from the beginning!! I mean he's not even hidding it from you, and if you complain about it in the future he will through it to your face!!! He will tell you: Hell woman you knew what you were getting into!! Believe me he will, and it's not that he's gonna be wrong either! Cos after all you do know.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of other Capricorns out there. I mean that is what I have managed to learn myself in the mean time. You are an earth sign, just like me. I am a virgo. We tend to feel attracted to caps and they tend to like us too, simply cos they're earth too... but there are plenty of good capricorn specimens out there, leave the bad seaded ones for life/God to deal with... and go for the good ones. I can assure you there are a lot of them out there, good caps. I have met a couple recently, and maybe could even introduce you to one myself! lol But please don't walk that road... seriously, you don't wanna do that to yourself!|`|25789a74317dfb9012d328d8bf5868c2aa	always pay close attention to what a man says he does or won't do at the start because they never change and those words will come back to haunt you. he cheats and does drugs and will have no future. run fast very fast.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	A 48 year old that does drugs is  bad news. And very un-capricorn.<br>  Relationship is not worth pursueing because you are both old enough that you can't afford for it to not work out. They say these two signs are a good match but he doesn't sound like a full on Cappy so don't go there.|`|t9w4zqDaaa	Astrology aside you need to Run and not look back!

Tb3hIDy8aa	I bet you anything that you have nodules. It is where you have like little scabs on your vocal chords, and it makes it so that your voice is hoarse alot and also it cracks at a certain way.  It also makes your talking voice raspy. Check out this singing method to help it! It can be fixed quite a bit! :)<br>  Good Evening!  I noticed that you have some questions about singing. Here is a method that will help increase your range, your ability to sing with style and variation, and help to sing clearly and strongly.  Speech Level Singing.  It works very well, and I recomend it highly.  Speech level singing helps cure vocal cord paralysis, and nodgules.  It also helps people without these conditions to prevent them.  SLS helps people learn how to sing, and become the best that they can! A lot of famous and non famous people use this technique because with it your voice will not come out, or be damaged.  It also helps you sing high and low notes with a connected voice, so it sounds pleasant to the ears.  Find a Speech Level Singing teacher near you, so that you can start now! For more information, go to sources! If that doesn't work, then I guess it comes natural to a lot of people.  On your vocal cords you have a skin coat layer simular to your skin.  It varies on thickness, and quality.  That is what makes you sound like you, and so on some people it naturally sounds better. It is highly recomended that you get a SLS teacher.  Go to my first source and go to find a teacher near you.  If you cant afford a teacher then, go to youtube and type in speech level singing.  There is a playlist of warmups someone put on there, and just try your best!  Any way, Good Luck! :)|`|rooi4xIpaa	For me to answer, I have to ask questions.  What are you drinking beforehand?  Do you keep well hydrated during the day?  Do you smoke?  <br>  <br>  All of these can affect the way your voice reacts when you sing high.|`|yYAabiSLaa	Does it crack at a certain place in your range? It could be your passaggio|`|TNNSHdypaa	Drink milk & honey before you sing; it soothes the throat and will prevent your voice from cracking.|`|HJkfIq8Waa	Just hold your air in your diaphragm and learn to manage it..<br>  <br>  lip thrill will be of great help to avoid airy sound and it will also help you to manage your air..<br>  <br>  then learn how to belt out w/ ur mouth and throat are open..<br>  <br>  Practice a belting-out exercise to help you with diaphragmatic breathing, or even scaling will help you with that, lip thrill will be a help for diaphragmatic breathing..<br>  <br>  And in reaching high notes, curve your shoulders, to control you note; close your eyes, to focus and addition a lil drama; lessen your effort, for it might produce a squeaky sound; add stress, the source of the pressure of your voice to reach those high notes..<br>  <br>  I would love to teach to u what my coaches taught me about singing.. <br>  <br>  wanna know more?, IM me.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped you ;D
usxeet5vaa	Go to a room with a computer with internet and itunes, close the door, put a sign on it that says "DO NOT DISTURB", find lyrics to a song you like, buy the instrumental and singing version on iTunes, and sing along with the singing version first, then try line by line with the instrumental version after you think you've practiced enough. sing you're heart out when you sing a song! Act the song out! Put feeling into your song! Pretend yoy have a microphone and that you are on stage- after all, no one is watchin you... and they probably can't even see you!<br>  <br>  For warm ups, use a keyboard or piano, and play a note, and match it with your voice. Then play scales, and try and see how high and how low you can go, starting at middle C, and working your way up and down. Open your mouth really wide when you sing and warm up. <br>  <br>  Stretch before you sing. You will loosen up your muscles and this will provide oxygen for your body, and won't strain your voice. Also, keep your tongue down when you sing so it will prevent straining your voice too.<br>  <br>  Breathe with your diaphram! This means, that when you're about to sing, take a deep breath by pushing your stomach outwards (filling it with air), and then when you sing, release your stomach while you're singing the note. This will give you more power as well as give you better techniques (vibratos and others). Basically, it will keep you healthier and make you a better singer.<br>  <br>  Practice breathing through your diaphram everyday, so you're breath will get stronger, and so that you can hold notes longer. Pretty soon, you will breathe like this all the time...which basically means you're practicing singing without even singing- you're practicing through your breathing!<br>  <br>  Sing your heart out girl! ACT! DANCE! SHOW HAND MOTIONS! SHOW FEELINGS! You can do it, hun! Just follow the rules above so you won't hurt yourself when you do sing your heart out.<br>  <br>  Join a choir or private singing lessons at a music school to better your voice. You'll be surprised at what you can learn... and what you can acheive!<br>  <br>  Don't be scared to shopw your family and friends what you got in singing! Just sing with a singing teacher, and you'll be fine. I prefer private lessons because you are the most important person at that time...you are trying to improve your voice, and sing your best- and someone is willing to help you! You can also sing with your own style in a private lesson, and no one will make fun of you! In chorus', you have to sing like everyone else...NOT FUN! But it is a good practice for beginners, I guess. <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of warm water, and try to stay away from dairy products before you sing because they coat the throat and make it hard to sing.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK MY FRIEND!<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|AA10717756	definitely practice songs on your ipod, the radio, etc. <br>  <br>  anywhere you hear music, try and sing along. <br>  thats what i do [:<br>  <br>  and definitely drink a L0T of water. <br>  soda and other drinks dont do much good for your voice. <br>  <br>  hope this helps [:|`|PeuFnqQwaa	If you really enjoy singing, I'd recommend Voice Lessons from a Qualified instructor.

Try singing to yourself when listening to music, and then maybe, one by one, in front of others. Another way is to simply shock yourself into singing in front of a crowd - sign up for a talent show. If others think you're good, there shouldn't be very much to worry about, is there?<br>  <br>  Another way is posting your singing on youtube. :) Good ol' youtube will give you good feedback.<br>  <br>  -- Xissae|`|jhgq7mewaa	1.)stand up tall<br>  2.)when breathing DO NOT move your shoulders only move stomach in and out<br>  3.)find the range that is good for you<br>  4.)practice|`|HJkfIq8Waa	Just hold your air in your diaphragm and learn to manage it..<br>  <br>  lip thrill will be of great help to avoid airy sound and it will also help you to manage your air..<br>  <br>  then learn how to belt out w/ ur mouth and throat are open..<br>  <br>  Practice a belting-out exercise to help you with diaphragmatic breathing, or even scaling will help you with that, lip thrill will be a help for diaphragmatic breathing..<br>  <br>  And in reaching high notes, curve your shoulders, to control you note; close your eyes, to focus and addition a lil drama; lessen your effort, for it might produce a squeaky sound; add stress, the source of the pressure of your voice to reach those high notes..<br>  <br>  I would love to teach to u what my coaches taught me about singing.. <br>  <br>  wanna know more?, IM me.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped you ;D
c8CFPgRlaa	Well, I've only been to Metallica and Guns N' Roses concerts but I guess the same rules apply. <br>  <br>  1) Don't be afraid to be social. If you're sitting/standing next to a stranger (JBros are popular, so you probably will be), don't be afraid to talk to them during act changes or during any intermissions.<br>  <br>  2) Cameras are usually allowed, so you can take all the photos you want. Depending on where your seats are, you should be able to get good photos. Digital cameras are even better, because you can make a photo your wallpaper. <br>  <br>  3) Don't be afraid to SCREAM!!!! I'm in a band (not as popular as the JBros, mind you) and we love it when our fans show their love for us by screaming and headbanging. This is a great way to keep their morale high.<br>  <br>  Haha I may have looked too far into it, but I hope this helps ya.|`|TtN2uZUuaa	While I don't know who the opener is going to be, I think they didn't say yet.

3NLThcMUaa	It varies with the anime. For example, Black Jack usually has a full episode equal one chapter of the manga, but I have another manga, Victorian Romance Emma, that had two-three chapters equal a single episode. It's a matter I think of dialogue and how much scenery in the mangas they want to be seen in the anime adpations.

dibBENqWaa	Capricorn what? Capricorn Rising? Capricorn Moon? Capricorn Sun?<br>  I'll just give info about all these Capricorn positions.<br>  <br>  Capricorn Sun Sign<br>  Capricorn, the tenth Sign of the Zodiac, is all about hard work. Those born under this Sign are more than happy to put in a full day at the office, realizing that it will likely take a lot of those days to get to the top. That's no problem, since Capricorns are both ambitious and determined: they will get there. Life is one big project for these folks, and they adapt to this by adopting a businesslike approach to most everything they do. Capricorns are practical as well, taking things one step at a time and being as realistic and pragmatic as possible. The Capricorn-born are extremely dedicated to their goals, almost to the point of stubbornness. Boy, those victories sure smell sweet, though, and that thought alone will keep Capricorns going.The Goat symbolizes Capricorns, and an apt mascot it is. Goats love to climb to the top of the mountain, where the air is clear and fresh. In much the same way, Capricorns want to get to the top of their chosen field so that they can reap the benefits of success; namely fame, prestige and money. Getting to the top isn't always a walk in the park, however, so it's likely that Goats will ruffle a few feathers along the way. These folks can indeed be domineering, even egotistical, on their route to the top. They'll tell you it's part of being a leader with bright new ideas (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign).<br>  Capricorns are industrious, efficient, organized and won't make a lot of waves. They are scrupulous with details and adopt a rather conventional posture in business and in life. These folks feel best playing it safe, since this is a fail-safe way to get to the top -- eventually.Thankfully, Capricorns are patient, too, and are happy to wait for their ship to come in. The flip side to this staid behavior is that Goats can become quite unforgiving of those who aren't as diligent or ambitious as they are. Capricorns need to remember that they do need allies along the way, ambitious or otherwise. In any case, once Capricorns receive the recognition and social status they so fervently crave, it's likely that all will be forgiven. <br>  <br>  Capricorn Moon<br>  A person with Moon in Capricorn is reserved.  They like to be in control; of themselves, others, environments and any situations they find themselves in.Having control, but also the responsibility of it, helps them to feel secure.Security is also very important to them. They pride themselves in this and in being reliable, and realistic, and are extraordinarily practical and have good common sense.  Duty and obligations are important to their emotional needs; both in being able to fulfill themselves and in their expectations of others. They rarely waste time with people or interests that are too variable.   Moon <br>  in Capricorn people have a strong fear of rejection.  Because of this, they often reject their own emotional reactions first, for fear of receiving a negative response.  They have a hard time opening up and exposing their softer and sentimental side.<br>  <br>  Capricorn Ascendant<br>  A Capricorn Rising has an austere personality, but don't confuse this with being a bore. There is a seriousness of purpose that often makes the child with this Rising Sign seem much older than their years.Executive proficiency is important and becomes a strong defense mechanism in the Capricorn Ascendant. The impression is that you have just met a very capable individual. A drive to succeed is pronounced in the Capricorn Rising person, and this covers their personal life, marriage, career and social image.Success is like a religion, but of course the rest of the individual chart becomes critical for this to blossom. Like the Cancer Ascendant, Capricorn Rising can display an interest in history and antiques, so this is a good hint as to how this person will decorate. In appearance this is the look of quiet understatement and simple elegance.This Ascendant needs a protective partner who can support them emotionally in the pursuit of a career or goal. Perseverance is marked here, and the physique can have a chiseled or bony look.

LE09g68gaa	I agree.<br>  What does he really know about dancing?<br>  Didnt he only dance with N'SYNC?<br>  The other judges at least know what they're talking about.<br>  When they love a crew, he finds something wrong with them.<br>  I dont know what they put him as a judge.|`|nY8BVJP2aa	i do think hes a good judge.  and certainly more qualified than lil mama, who is just a rapper.  have u noticed that he knows what the acutal moves are called, he doesnt just say "i loved that thing where u moved ur arms," he will actually say, "i loved the tutting in the show."  jc had to learn dances and perform them, but on a much broader scale.  shane is awesome, of course, but he doesnt have the performance aspect that jc does.  shane just has to make the dances amazing technically, while jc knows firsthand that even if a dance is great technically, it is the dancer who brings it to life w/his personality.|`|93fouYDzaa	I think he is a good judge because he gives them good critiques instead of just saying things such as "y'all was hot" to every single group. He is inexperienced in the dance field himself, N*Sync being his only group, but i think overall he is good at judging.

df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	Al Pacino.....just saw scent of a women....they guy can play so many roles and be so believable....he's amazing...but I do like bobby d also....|`|AA12382198	I really tried to pick one....but I can't. I like and admire both of them equally as actors.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Wow, that's a tough one - two of my favorite actors & two legends.<br>  <br>  I think I'd have to say DeNiro. I can't stand his politics but he is incredible. I think he's versatile and can fit many roles - look at The Godfather, Taxi Driver, The Good Shepherd, Casino, Goodfellas, Meet the Parents, Raging Bull, City by the Sea, Sleepers, This Boy's Life & A Bronx Tale (amazing performance in both of these). He's just an all around amazing actor.<br>  <br>  If you look at all of the best, most powerful movies in cinema history, DeNiro is in a lot of them. He is classic, one of the best of his time. But, I LOVE Pacino, too. It's impossible to pick!|`|fQAjPXPAaa	Can't stand DeNiro...never got why people were always so excited about him. Al Pacino wins hands-down. And please, can we all just admit that DeNiro is NOT funny so stop putting him in comedies like Meet the Parents? He always looks like he has a pain in his a**.|`|QD6U4nTxaa	i luv both of them but ill go with robert de niro anyways arent they getting a bit too old for all those action movies lol : )|`|JPnL8s12aa	i LOVE them both,<br>  they are very talented actors|`|L03wyBlNaa	I would have to go with Al Pacino. He just has this enigmatic screen presence that I admire. Although, I do find Robert De Niro to be a good actor also, I feel he - strangely - lacks the warmth in his characters that Pacino so frequently has. <br>  <br>  Another reason, as shallow as it may be, I find Pacino to be utterly beautiful.
gW0nD5cEaa	Like  you said, the actor and actress who play Chase and Cameron had a real life relationship and broke up, and made some scenes awkward.<br>  <br>  But also, the original doctors were  working under a Grant or something. Doctors do that as part of their training. They last a year or two or something. Realistically, (and we all know how real "House" is!), but really, they knew if real doctors were watching they would know they would have moved on after a year or 2. I<br>  <br>  I did not care for the new ones at first, but they grow on you. And look at ER, all the cast changes on there and basically it's always been the same show. I know the format is totally different, but still cast changes and additions are not always all bad.|`|1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	Probably just to spicen it up a bit (I actually quit watching it when they put on the new docs).  And Jesse and Jennifer were never married; they were engaged and then broke off the engagement.|`|SbH5c7jdaa	probably added new characters to get people to watch it again,<br>  ratings aren't very good.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Probably just to shake things up a bit.  Jesse Spencer and Jennifer Morrison didn't break up until after their characters were fired, so that's unrelated.

Y0w2Pk5kaa	Adam appeared in Saw as a photographer hired and paid by the discharged Detective David Tapp to follow Lawrence Gordon and take pictures of him. He was targeted and kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer for "being a voyeur" of other peoples lives without indulging in his own. Adam was placed into a game of Jigsaw's, alongside Lawrence. The two of them were chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of a grimy bathroom and given conflicting goals; Lawrence was told to kill Adam by 6:00 in order to save his family, while Adam had to find some way to stay alive. Adam had been initially placed unconscious in a bathtub full of water along with the key to his shackle, which would have allowed him to escape without harm. However, he panicked upon waking up and kicked the stopper loose, causing the key to be sucked down the drain. Adam killed Zep Hindle, whom he thought was Jigsaw, only to discover that the seemingly dead man in the middle of the bathroom floor was alive and the real killer. He ultimately failed his 'game' and was left to die in the trap alone. <br>  In Saw III, it is revealed that Jigsaw's apprentice, Amanda Young, returned to the bathroom and suffocated Adam to death to end his suffering. According to the original script, the key was not meant to go down the drain, or at least not right away; Amanda had tied the stopper to Adam's ankle, something she had not been instructed to do.<br>  <br>  To find out more about the rest of the Saw series, just search for a plot synopsis or go on IMDb. It will be too long to write about the 5 films, they are very complicated.|`|GiiPoof5aa	he died,and i think in saw 4 or 3 they show him in the bathrooms ''rotten to death''l(ike jiigsaw said) and they also show a leg

And violence against men is wrong too. Does it mean that it should happen??... no!.. but in the end some people have anger issues and learn how to hit from their family members that have done it to them.<br>  In the end, Rhianna is sending the wrong message to go back with their abusers.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	No Double Standards here but It does send a Reality Check that Rihanna is risking her Life with Chris Brown because she will most likely not get out alive like here.

sc4BtGxGaa	This YouTube piece is written in a semi-classical styles, and uses instruments we usually associate with classical music.  Many of the FM radio websites that play a great deal of classical music often have suggested listening lists for newbies - so do some of the classical recroding sites.  You could check KUSC, WGBH, WQXR, and I know that other people will give you more.  If you go thru a Radio Locator site, you can find the big, powerful FM stations in major cites, that play a lot of classical music.  NAXOS and even Amazon will give you listening lists. or, if you *order*  (pretend . . ) top get something, they will offer *people who bought this also bought . . "<br>  <br>  If you look at a college textbook for a survey of music history (a popular tect is The History of Western Music by D.J. Grout) then there will be accompanying CDs, or a listing.  And never overlook the Dummies or Idiot's Guide Series.  Unfortunate name - but they are often FULL of great information, and given in a no-judgmental way.  NOBODY like being made to feel Less Than - I am currently doing orthopedic therapy after surgery, and then need to take my old, pudgy body to a gym to get into shape - and the gym that will get my business HERE is the one that has "NON-JUDGMENTAL" on all its literature and walls!  So - start today. See if there is a Yahoo GROUP that will support you - I am in one for professional flutists.  Everyone wants to learn, and NOBODY wants to feel foolish or shy while doing it!  Good luck!|`|hcNXuFCJaa	This looks like movie soundtracks.  Very beautiful music.<br>  <br>  John Williams is the absolute, can't go wrong with anything he's done, but more along these lines you might try Tan Dun.  First one is Eternal Vow from Crouching Tiger hidden dragon. 2nd link is from the movie Hero titled Farewell, Hero.

Quite amazing!|`|eXMI11kkaa	choral music is important. do not overlook.<br>  John Tavener's "song for athene" is very chilling.<br>  <br>  Debussy is a must-listen.<br>  "La cathedrale engloutie."<br>  "Claire de lune"<br>  "Arabesque." <br>  <br>  And of course, you have your typical.<br>  beethoven, mozart, bach.<br>  <br>  Also, it's important to go back in history and also look at medievel and renaissance music. Choral music in 4ths and 5ths. Polyphonic choral music...|`|8966788df07da7406962e8509333231baa	Start with some popular pieces, like Bach's suite no 1 for cello (prelude), or Beethoven's Fur Elise. If you use imeem.com, and start with those really popular pieces, it makes suggestions on other songs to listen to. At least, that's how I got started.<br>  From there, you'll figure out what you really like in classical music.

Then her choked her and bit her ear. When she called her assisstant to tell them to call the cops he told her thats the worst mistake she could have ever made and he was going to kill her.  Now he is going to trial in April and it looks like they reconciled and made up. In the end he looks like a woman abuser and she looks like a weak woman for reconciling with him.

93fouYDzaa	Season six is going to be the last season, it has been confirmed. I think it has gotten a little too out there, being that we never get answers, only new questions. But i can't stop watching and i am hoping that the last season will be stunningly amazing to make up for some of the nonsense going on.|`|Rm1zxWQmaa	If a boat just showed up and said "we are here to rescue you."that would be a little disappointing.

The pacing is good, the stories are tightly told, and it's becoming nore interesting with each new episode.|`|365ffadfb5791af94012e18f6f8d2a42aa	hell no..its just getting started!! im loving this new season so far..they are finally answer questions!!! Only one more season after season 5 so it will be ending sometime next year : ( which sux for us LOST obessed fans but i do agree they cant do much else with the story so im kinda glad they are gonna wrap it up ..it will def be bitter sweet..lets just hope they dont mess it up somehow
PbbFQbx2aa	Angel in the night by Basshunter|`|ox4MdqcVaa	This song is quite punky compared to angels and airwaves but it has a good meaning: Sexist appeal - Aus Rotten<br>  <br>  Try: Tell me why - P.O.D<br>  and: Violence - Youth Brigade<br>  They're both anti-war songs and very good.|`|nrHY3JRMaa	the song misery business by Paramore has a  very strong meaning. its abouta friend of theirs who was using another friend by abusing them.

SO a good one that we have found is to tie two people's doors together, and leave in the morning they cant get out but other people can always let them out.  Another good one is to tape all the way up someone door frame, so when they wake up they see the tape and freak out for a second.  Of course you could take it a step further and put soda cans in between the door frame and the door and something not necessarily tape but something to hold the cans in place so that when they open the door the suction pulls the cans in on them.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	mix peanut butter, molasses, nd flour and shape it into a dog poop and put it in on their chest or if ur brave enough a human one in their pants.|`|ws0nvFi5aa	make a mustache using tape and draw glasses with a permanent marker or just a regular marker and make a really thick unibrow|`|iekMDUqVaa	hmm when they wake up they go to the restroom and look at the mirror and there is a person in the mirror but you cant see that person.|`|61067fedf264463ca62586a8d1d24170aa	take their underwear and put them in the freezer<br>  <br>  every1 go into another room before they wake up so theyr spazzing out when they wake up<br>  <br>  shaving cream....thats a classic|`|COMOAbB3aa	Draw on thier face of put something in thier hands then brush a feather across thier face.|`|qbk4KihIaa	how about, putting shaving cream in their hands and tickling their nose.<br>  lol<br>  or just draw on their face.
qLLx4qHpaa	New episodes come out every Sunday (barring those rare occasions when it's pushed back a week), and are subbed that same day on Crunchyroll. <br>  <br>  However, Crunchyroll requires you to pay for new episodes, so I usually just do a google search with "Skip Beat" + "Episode 22" and it will show me online sites linking to that episode for free. They're usually posted by 6 or 7 pm on a variety of websites.

AA12390047	Ray had to have his tonsils out and his blood pressure dropped dangerously low for just a short time and he could have died.  Everyone paniced and didn't tell Marie.  She found out later that night when he was home and ran across the street and got in bed with Ray & Debra.|`|956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Ray Barone stresses about getting his adenoids removed. Everyone assures him he'll be fine, but he believes otherwise. As it turns out, the doctors have trouble taking Ray out of anesthesia, and his family quickly gets worried, until the doctor comes out moments later to explain that he is fine. It is agreed that Ray will not be told, and neither will Marie, who was in the bathroom at the time. However, Marie gets the truth out of Frank, and Debra must explain the incident to Raymond, who is still unaware of the mishap. The ensuing discussion, which includes Robert and Amy as well, involves Ray asking, "So for 30 seconds, you all thought I was dead?", which was followed with a smile and asking, "What did everybody do?" One by one, each Barone express their love for Ray (either subtly or noticeably). The next day, the entire family sits down at the table for breakfast. Everyone is talking and laughing, and the show ends on that note.|`|R0SoIZWOaa	Ray had to get his tonsils removed but he was afraid. He mentioned to debra that he was afraid that the nurse's top would unbutton and the surgeon will get distracted and make a mistake (although nurse's tops don't have buttons.) Anyway so the family convinces that he'll be fine. During the surgery there is this tiny misunderstanding which cause the nurse to tell Debra, Amy, Robert and Frank that Ray's not getting up while Marie was in the bathroom. They all get emotional and a few seconds later the doctor comes out and tell everyone that Ray is fine. They decide to tell neither Marie or Ray about what happen. That was working until Frank accidentally said it to marie while they were borderline Intimate . Marie rushed over to Ray's and walks in on him and Debra in bed and literally jumps on top of her to get to ray. Ray finds out and panics about his death. He claims he hears his dead uncle while he was under. Amy reveals Roberts emotions about Ray. <br>  The episode ends around the kitchen table with everyone there talking over one another. <br>  It's a brilliant episode, funny with a touch of emotion. I tried to looks for videos or clips on youtube but I couldnt find any. You really have to see it.|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	Ray tried to fix the gas line instead of hiring a handy man.

zgXLCMZoaa	I have many different opinions on michael jackson. for one, he's a freakin legend and nothing is ever gonna change that! i mean he came out with hit after hit...the man was unstoppable. take thriller for example, that video is epic and if you havent seen it, you must've been living under a freakin boulder for the past 20 or so years!!! michael is the king of pop and i have yet to see someone steal that title from him! theres been many people who have tried to, but **** we all know that they couldnt touch him, cant touch him now, and never will be able to!!! but yea, michael has certainly gotten into trouble with the law lol! im not sure if everything he's been accused of is true but of course in all reality, no one does but michael and the boys who claimed that he did this and that to them. but if what he was accused of is true, i blame the parents of the little boys, because why the hell would you let your sons spend the ******* night at a mansion called "Neverland" for a sleepover hosted by a grown man??? hello the saying goes, "if you play with fire, you get burned!" but who knows what happened, and ****, who really even cares any more! michael's music is amazing and no matter how many people may call him "wacko jacko" or say that he's a sick molester who bleached himself (when they should know he has a disease because why the hell would he even wanna bleach himself?) are the main ones that know every word to thriller, beat it, billy jean, smooth criminal and all his other greatest hits! honestly, i think michael is everyones idol because he has inspired sooooooooooooo many people! shoot, i dont think the world would be the same if he never existed!|`|XK6k2UAIaa	He is and always will be the king of pop.

ulkWZlwpaa	marvel has more godhax characters|`|mCKqajs7aa	Well since Marvel regardless of generation had more ruthless superheroes that may have all the time included Wolverine then I expect Marvel to win because DC has this thing about not killing when they are led by SUperman. But Bruce Wayne could care less what planet Clark is from and he will bring out the kryptonite to make sure DC won the battle.|`|f2BFPF7Yaa	well, i believe that marvel will win. marvel has characters like proffesor X, magneto, juggernaut, the incredible hulk, thor, onslaught, the silver surfer, galactus, the living tribunal, the vision, carnage, the sentry, electro. all of these characters can match and surpass all of D.Cs characters. superman has lost to hulk, and marvel's the sentry posseses all of supermans powers and strenghs, exept for the fact that he isnt vulnerable or weak to anything. the point is, marvel has more galactic beings than D.C and marvel has more characters over all, so at the end, marvel will win.
0b701a01033c96d1933cab42e0a5b0c5aa	Silver Surfer would mop the floor with Dr. M.  Silver Surfer's powers are vast.  He can create black holes, and spawn super novas, and is himself, an inter-dimensional being.  And lets not even start with Galactus.<br>  <br>  Whereas Dr. M's powers, from what we know, include creating glass fortresses on the surface of Mars, killing Viet-kong soliders and destroying tanks.  Him being able to see the future and the past doesn't really do much for him in this fight.|`|ulkWZlwpaa	I'm also inclined to believe the silver surfer would win, because he can also reform the structure of matter at will<br>  <br>  Manhattan hints at abiogenesis, but the surfer has succeeded already by creating QUASIMODO|`|rEcts8Skaa	What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable wall?

Q0j9sHQXaa	the beginning is the end is the beginning by the smashing pumpkins..originally on the batman (tim burtons) soundtrack|`|4x8kMR5Saa	"Take a Bow" by Muse|`|wvaN6zPZaa	I'm not sure which trailer you are referring to.. but I'll list the musical pieces used in both of the Watchmen trailers.<br>  <br>  1. First Trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3orQKBxiEg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3orQKBxi...</a><br>  <br>  The song playing in the first trailer is "The Beginning is the End is the Beginning" by the Smashing Pumpkins.. This is a variant of the Batman and Robin version of the song.<br>  <br>  2. Second Trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB3AxenYAyU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB3AxenYA...</a><br>  <br>  The first instrumental piece is "Pruit Igoe & Prophecies" by the Phillip Glass Ensemble and it is followed by "Take a Bow" by Muse.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!

JXJQTgULaa	That was the episode when they went on a "break". Rachel told Ross that she wanted to go on a break, and so Ross was really upset and went to a bar. He meets some girl and ends up having sex with her that night. Later in the episode, Rachel finds out and Ross feels horrible. That is when they can't be together because all they did was fight about it. Rachel says that he shouldn't have done that in the first place and Ross says that since they were on a break that it was okay... but I personally believe that it wasn't. So later on in the season they hate each other and refuse to speak to one another. The next season (the episode that you are thinking of) they try to get back together and Rachel can't do it because she keeps thinking of that other girl that Ross made love to.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  =D|`|lwtBIBmoaa	i think its episode 16 season 3|`|6t76bgS3aa	I think it's the "we were on a break" one|`|KfKr3hUmaa	idk<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinNfZ4A570Nrx49p0Faj.jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307170412AAsIjUa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QeX89rP2aa	i think its part 2 of "on a break" or something. in part one he sleeps with some girl, and part 2 he wants rachel back. i think...|`|1suIEET4aa	thats "the one with the morning after"season 3..ross cheated on rachel..well techinically they were "on a break"but yea..|`|rabjcdjHaa	Season 3 - Episode 16 - "The One on the Morning After"|`|WWlUrwJxaa	Idk,but the last one has something like that,but the last couple episodes SUCKso i dont know much about what happens in the end.|`|5OU2wdBvaa	Aaaww that episode makes me wanna cry!........................But I don't because I normally watch Friends with some one lol. =P|`|894aXFYUaa	Very good episode that one was<br>  season 6 episode 5<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|pSq1cZIWaa	Season 6 episode 5.

jOlU8EUkaa	ITS Long!<br>  <br>  Fire Me...Please was an hour-long hidden camera reality series which aired on CBS in summer 2005. Two contestants each reported to a new job at separate locations and figure out how to get fired as close to 3:00 p.m. as possible (the store owners are in on the gag, but the managers are not). When both contestants are fired, they report back to host Dave Holmes, and whoever was fired at the right time wins $25,000.<br>  <br>  is this what you're talking about, I remember what you meant....

ykIleAQ7aa	I think maybe you made a typo because I don't see where you got the 8 of pentacles (coins). You have 8 of swords in two places.  If in fact the 8 of Swords was your first card under the stay with him option. The 8 of swords is all about restriction. By staying with him you're holding yourself back from what you really want. May feel afraid of change so you keep yourself in what's familiar even if its making you unhappy. <br>  8 of Pentacles (coins) is not a bad card to get. Its a card of education. <br>  You're not yet a master - your still have got a lot to learn you need more experience and knowledge in your life.<br>  7 of Rods (wands) this card is one of being in the point of advantage. You will be able to over come any opposing forces that come your way. Although it may look as though the odds aren't in your favor you will be able to stand up and be triumphant.<br>  4 of cups (not a bad card either just need to open your eyes!) <br>  You may feel bored or dissatisfied in with your life. But you are ignoring your surroundings! This card is a warning against missing out on opportunities. Don't concentrate on the negative look around you may find someone or a situation that may be offering you an out that could make you very happy.<br>  9 of Swords: (OK not this is a bad card to get sorry!)<br>  This card is about having intense anxiety. You may be losing sleep over your troubles. You are under great stress and need to figure out how to work out your problems. You must find a soution to what is nagging you. <br>  Ace of Rods (wands): This is a good time to tap into your creativity. A good time to start with new creative goals and ideas or anything that sparks your interest.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	It seems like you will leave him. I think you already know this(because of the Ace. It implies that a decision has been made of the intellect or will). The 8 of swords means there is some interference. In relationships it either a problem that has become a hangup or an affair.|`|fcEKMw1Haa	well  there is a slight problem you list  8 of swords twice , but just going on the the general feel of the cards in your layout, I see this a new and beginning relationship for you.  You have at least 3 swords which tells me that you have already made a decision.  The 4 of cups is a card of joy and renewal  four women with cups held high in celebration.  Unfortunately  your question is two in two parts   should I stay or go and your reading is ambigous  reflecting the two part nature of your question.

WwVjr8iGaa	It HAS to be the chicken right ?<br>  As two other species of bird [similar to the chicken] would have mated and oh i just realised, it'd be the egg! As those two species would have to be egg-laying animals if chickens are.<br>  <br>  Therefore after creating a chicken, they lay an egg and a chicken is born.<br>  <br>  I can't believe all this time i've had the thought that it was the chicken that came first due to my theory, then realised it must have been the egg lol.<br>  <br>  It was very funny when my biology class had this as a discussion, literally lasted the whole 50min lesson!|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	Thought the chicken was caught smoking in bed, <br>  So it came first|`|0lK97zzVaa	egg I think|`|VSfiigz3aa	the egg|`|kTxeGj1aaa	From a Scientific view the egg came first as things laid eggs long before chickens, and chickens are a result of natural selection from birds that came before chickens. From a Creationist view, Chickens came first as God created Chickens and made them lay eggs along with all the other animals of the world. Please refer to Genesis and anything that explains Evolutionary Theory and decide which you believe. The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is a good place to start, Wikipedia is faster and shorter though and will give you the general overview.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a nice day! :)|`|JN65AUx3aa	theoretically its the egg, since dinosaurs and other animals layed eggs before chickens even existed. but i really don't care to tell you the truth, i dont think anyone does.|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	I'm a christian so I'm required to say chicken.|`|SbH5c7jdaa	the chicken|`|iekMDUqVaa	the egg.

Coverup is the worse unless it's some really bad pimples, but even then, it reminds me of old english queens with an inch thick makeup on.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the girl, really.|`|A3jilLA9aa	Doesn't matter, my biggest turn-on is a personality.

That's probably about half of the week.<br>  <br>  I'm bi, and I'm more attracted to girls who don't wear make-up -- she will strand out more than all of the other girls with their eyeshimmer and lip gloss.

Just foundation, mascara, and lipstick. If I'm going out somewhere important, I wear blush and eye shadow too. I don't wear eye liner that much, I don't like how it looks on me.<br>  But I like to pay more attention to my hair, actually. I don't care as much about my makeup as I do my hair.

D8sN8gNFaa	Hetfield.<br>  <br>  Grunge isn't a type of music, it's not even a sub genre. Most of the Seattle bands would fall under the category of "hard rock" or "heavy rock" Nirvana was practically a punk band (no surprise considering they had dozens of punk influences) I'm not sure how much they influenced the other Seattle bands, but it couldn't have been a lot since they all had a unique sound. Cobain influenced a lot of crappy "post grunge" bands, and wannabes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hetfield is thrash. His voice (although it has changed over the years) always seems to keep the perfect mix of yelling and singing. Although Metallica aren't thrash anymore, and haven't made a metal record since 1988, they have influenced and inspired, countless bands.<br>  <br>  <br>  I give Hetfield the win. But Cobain sure could scream. Cobain was actually a big Metallica fan, with "Ride The Lightning" being one of his favourite albums, and whiplash being one of his favorite songs. He went to see Metallica at a gig in Seattle in 1992. He was in the snake pit. Kirk talks about that gig on youtube, and about Cobain being there. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lFlKiw_wpI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lFlKiw_w...</a>|`|rOhD4XqYaa	As much as I love Hetfield and what he has contributed to the music world Id have to say Cobain...The sound Nirvana created started a new generation (grunge) that killed rock n roll....many feel he and the band are pioneers of grunge more so than Hetfield is to Thrash.<br>  <br>  even though Metallica is giving credit by other bands Id still say Nirvana just because when they came out people looked up and said WTF....either liken em or hating them..Metallica was still underground and didnt garnish the attention that Nirvana got even though videos/news/music were more open towards the end of the 80's and start of the 90's helping to spread the appeal of Nirvana...and others started to tire of the Hard rock and Poser rock that took over in the end of the 80s music scene:)|`|47QsxtN0aa	I would say Cobain, simply because no other grunge band really measured up to Nirvana's popularity in 90's. Metallica competed with Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax.|`|sORJIVlXaa	Kind of a tough question. I would have to say James simply because it is very very rare a Metal band does not cite Metallica as an influence.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I have to say Cobain as of now. <br>  <br>  Sadly people get blown up after they die and not while they are alive. Though I'm sure Hetfield knows that he is an enormous influence.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Cobain has probably become more iconic since his death but as far as inflence there is literally a ton of so called Nu-Metal bands that cite Metallica as a major influence. Therfore I say James.<br>  <br>  BTW this is a very interesting question.

TKf6z1vHaa	Make me a supermodel, b/c it is more realistic to what the modeling world it. Tyra's show is more about trying to sell high fashion, but the majority of her models just end up looking really commercial. Plus there are boy models on the other show.|`|jOlU8EUkaa	I think Top Model is way better. I've Been a fan since the 4th cycle( end of 3rd) and loved it since. Supermodel's first season was a bore and I didn't like the Public Voting Aspect of it( didn't they take that away for season 2) I'm not planning on watching the 2nd season of it. Yes they have males on there but Top Model is better for many reasons IMO|`|1ykzSRtKaa	Top model, defantly !<br>  No competetion.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	I prefer top Model...Tyra worked hard and her show is addictive!

Y1aAGPURaa	Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning.<br>  I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 'Happy Birthday!', and possibly have a small present for me.<br>  As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ' Happy Birthday.'<br>  I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.<br>  My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.<br>  As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 'Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday ! '<br>  It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.<br>  I worked until one o'clock , when Jane knocked on my door and said, 'You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.'<br>  I said, 'Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go !'<br>  We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead at a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.<br>  On the way back to the office, Jane said, 'You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, Do We ?'<br>  I responded, 'I guess not. What do you have in mind ?'<br>  She said, 'Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.'<br>  After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ' Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.'<br>  'Ok.' I nervously replied.<br>  She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake .... Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing 'Happy Birthday'.<br>  <br>  And I just sat there... On the couch... Naked.|`|R6wjTZ63aa	What did God say when he made a black person<br>  <br>  Oh S***! I burnt one!|`|ENlTzpNFaa	This ones a bit disgusting but oh well!<br>  <br>  Three vampires walk into a bar and the first vampire asks for a pint of blood. The barman pours it and passes it to the vampire.<br>  The second vampire also asks for a pint of blood and again the barman pours it and passes it to him. <br>  The third one asks for a cup of hot water. The barman gives him a strange look and asks why he isn't having a pint of blood. <br>  The vampire pulls out a used tampon and says "I'm having tea!!!"|`|cbbe1a6fcfe13f2a4e897b856d0efec8aa	The Hard Times<br>  <br>  <br>  I knew there were tough times ahead<br>  <br>  First, I got angina pectoris and then arteriosclerosis.<br>  <br>  Just as I was  recovering from those, I got Tuberculosis, <br>  <br>  Double Pneumonia and Peritonitis.<br>  <br>   Then they gave me Inoculations<br>  <br>   Appendicitis was followed by Tonsillectomy. <br>  <br>  These gave way to Hypothermia and Cirrhosis.<br>  <br>   I lost my memory completely for a while. <br>  <br>  I knew I had Diabetes and acute Ingestion,<br>  <br>  Besides gastritis, Rheumatism ,Lumbago and Neurosis.<br>  <br>  God knows how I got thru....................<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   F**K ME!! <br>  <br>  That was the Hardest <br>  <br>  Spelling Test I have Ever Seen

2EU62lHkaa	just like the other guy i refreshed my page until they were on sale and they sold out in seconds, i think ticketmaster is bull, but that is personally my opinion! so rich fat guys get who pay people to get the tickets for them can go see paul and people like me, and i am sure the guy above me, have to sit home and dream about our favorite band in the world -2 playing together, it is very frustrating!|`|mMfsyaDqaa	They started at about $74 each on ticketmaster, but I went online right at 11 when they went on sale and they were already sold out!

ax9xk0Ndaa	I agree with Virgo Moon..<br>  Capricorn Moon can be too but they're more cautious than shy..<br>  <br>  For example, my sister is an Aquarius with an Aries Rising but her Virgo Moon makes her kinda shy..even though she is a very blunt and assertive outgoing person lol..<br>  <br>  Cancer Moons can be.. but it's mostly when we're around people we not only don't know but are getting a bad vibe off.. or places that we're uncomfortable in.. where we're not sure of everyones intentions for us or where we feel that we're being judged..<br>  <br>  Apart from that i'm not really shy|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I suppose the only one i think of as shy might be moon in Virgo. They just don't make friends very easily , or seem standoffish, and usually people who seem standoffish are really just shy i find.<br>  but i guess any of the negative signs came be shy because they are more introverted.<br>   So moon in water or earth signs maybe shy , especially if they have a water/earth sun|`|a3551013e2a866e590409dae69967bb3aa	not sure<br>  but ive heard aries moon can be concious at times and self concious <br>  <br>  and im an aries moon and that happens to me were im not to sure of myself and think i will embarass myself<br>  <br>  it sucks =[|`|eknuWrLLaa	i would think Capricorn moons. They may come off as shy at first because they dont trust automatically and will scope you out b4 becoming socially comfortable!|`|y7bZTvs6aa	i would say cancer...but thats only when theyre around unfamiliar or uncomfortable places or around people they are not used to..|`|lOkWLI9Caa	That would be my moon sign dear, it's called Capricorn moon, however Virgo moons are shy as well. <br>  <br>  I think the earthy moons that come across to people as the shy-est  are the ones who also have their Mercury in an earth or water sign. Well, they are more likely to be the  shy AND quiet type.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i agree with lollipop.. i know a couple of people with virgo moons and they tend to be a bit of a loner. they have a few good friends but hardly socialise and meet new people. i love virgo moon people.. they're very helpful and they love to be the one you call when you're feeling depressed... they like it when people open up to them and share their feelings but they would never ever express their emotions when they're sad or anything... they just hide it and disappears...

pd8Ujgzfaa	I would play the charvel first. If you sell your Epiphone before you are sure you like the charvel, that could end up being a huge mistake. Be sure you know what you are getting before you start burning bridges. Once you sell your Les Paul, there is no turning back. I can not emphasize enough that you are sure about what you are gaining and what you are giving up. Otherwise you could be stuck with a guitar that you don't like.|`|gtJrUIP7aa	noooooo|`|fsP9alNkaa	it is your decision. everyone has there own opinion|`|OEB6GcmBaa	yeah sounds good|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	sounds good to me, I dont care for epiphones...|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Yea sure, gr8 idea(*_*)|`|hexzaIGgaa	Epiphones are crap. Get a real Gibson.|`|9WfLBpWkaa	eh.. idk im a little bit skeptical. i mean if its really a CUSTOM LES PAUL then i dont think its a good move. i mean a les paul is like.. the standard of rock!!!..|`|EnEI9BG7aa	personally i like les pauls better but the charvel is definately more rare so it depends what you want it for.|`|PyEhrC08aa	I think so....but it depends on the music you like to play

xLllDu18aa	as much as i would LOVE for him to perform here in america.<br>  i dont blame him. some of americans are really close minded and dont accept him after what happen. <br>  if he where to perfom here idk what would happen in hes concert. i mean theres alot of crazy ppl that would do crazy stuff. <br>  like throw things at him... like some ppl did at lil wayne<br>  just plain rude|`|192VzAFGaa	Well, it sort of stinks that he isn't performing anywhere else except London. I probably wouldn't be able to see him anyways if he can to the states, but that's not the point. I do understand that he is famous across the whole world. That's about 7.2 billon people. So he can only go so many place, and if he has ten shows, why not do a world tour to get around to people? But all in all, no, I don't feel cheated.|`|JPnL8s12aa	america screwed him over big time, so if he doesn't want to perform there it's totally up to him. i really hope that he does a wold tour and comes to canada!|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	American boys cost too much|`|SueMRdV8aa	Im English but... Apparently this is a start of a 3 Year World Tour. I think it would be best for him to end in his home country.|`|oAOWx47Taa	I know he still loves america. I love thriller.|`|l0HlT1YGaa	I don't feel cheated but I would love to see him in the U.S. too . I feel kinda bad for the guy. i think he's definitely strange but im not so sure i believe he is a child molester. As a parent, If you ever touched my child there would be no amount of money in the world that I would accept. Your butt would be sitting in prison for the rest of your life. The fact that these parents allowed their children  to stay with a possible known child molester is crazy to me. I think he got a bad deal and will have to live with it. People here called him guilty before he ever had the chance to prove himself innocent. He would have a hard time rebuilding his reputation again in the states.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Beat it"<br>  How did he make a quick get away and check out  from "Hotel California" in the Middle-east?<br>  Must have run as fast as his two legs can run from oppression as " Alley Oop" with slavery as "The Chain gang"  in the twilight zone then "Back to the Future" in different time zone in time.<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|rDs2e1Nhaa	Well first of all lets see IF he goes ahead with it he is not fit enough to go through with this I am sure he will cancel some if not all the dates.

I thought it was funny. Other than that, I couldn't really get into the TV show, I gave it a try, but it definitely wasn't working out for me there. If you want to watch a really funny TV animated show check out Family Guy.

GTr4kX7raa	Yup! Definitely!<br>  Your Capricorn sun and his Scorpio is real good. I'm Scorpio and I have some real good guy and girl friends that have Capricorn Sun.<br>  And the moon in Sagittarius and his in Gemini are opposites, but opposites are pretty good together and they attract each other.<br>  And your Libra rising and his Scorpio is a real good air-water match.<br>  He'll always be there for you and you guys will be a satisfying union.<br>  And your Libra rising and his Gemini moon are both Air signs which means you'll have a lot in common and have lots of fun together!<br>  Possibly have the same likes and dislikes. But to sum it all up, this is a great match! Go for it! :)<br>  Good Luck Girly :D|`|eknuWrLLaa	Yup. U both compliment n understand each other inside n out. Yay! Lol

bzzUBEmQaa	The rule of thumb for all electronic dance music (EDM), including techno, trance, house, etc, is that the best tracks tend to be the least mainstream. Unfortunately, appreciating the less mainstream stuff may be difficult for a beginning listener, which is why you see a lot of people posting very commercialized stuff like Basshunter here. <br>  <br>  Here are a few good EDM artists without venturing too far from the mainstream.

9KeX8dsJaa	It's very amateur sounding. Which is okay, because that's how a lot of professional music starts out and develops. There are some times where the music seems out of sync. Keep at it and perfect the beats, but when I first heard it I was jamming.  Less "shout outs" in the beginning. The beat was jamming though. I would give it like 4/10- it's good.|`|qMoeLomeaa	i like them :)<br>  gonna download those songs if i can =]|`|OehjuDxVaa	I hate rap but I actually think its pretty good.|`|pEfEOuu9aa	ya i love rap ..
glWmnsXAaa	The advance is based on the album not the band signing. You will get an advance for each album with a major record label and of course this advance is more a loan that is paid back out of your royalties.<br>  <br>  I am not sure about current numbers as the majors have been laying people off by the hundreds each month past year or so. However I can give you some samples from past contracts I have found and looked over.<br>  <br>  1st album - $25,000 - $50,000<br>  2nd album - $75,000 - $150,000<br>  3rd album+ - $150,000+<br>  <br>  Obviously each album past the 1st depends on the sales of the previous for instance those artists whose previous albums sold 100,000+ in the 1st week can sometimes get advances as high as $1,000,000 for their next album. <br>  <br>  Mind you the whole reason for the advance is to keep you in debt to the label. This makes it harder for you to leave the label if you are successful. And if you aren't successful then maybe the Label will make their money back over the course of 75+ years from back catalog sales while owing you nothing.

UAHjJpC0aa	does the school know that you are trying to steal the music?<br>  <br>  it is not legal to download copyright music without paying for it<br>  and that DOES include sheet music<br>  <br>  same thing a shoplifting<br>  <br>  and just saying that everyone does it does NOT make it right, or legal|`|Hrt9VcBtaa	I wish I knew because I play flute!<br>  But I think it's illegal to download free sheet music, (although I can't say anything, I download free music, but who doesn't?)I think your best bet would be to ask a music teacher or band teacher, or just simply google it, and you might find fairly cheap sheet music.<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|wmohp5jdaa	Sorry I don't quite know where you could find the music sheets, but I guess you could try youtube.
