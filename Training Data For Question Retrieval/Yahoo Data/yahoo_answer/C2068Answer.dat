bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Nossa, eu n?o sabia que a Sade havia morrido!<br>  <br>  Na verdade, eu só conhe?o 3 músicas dela: "By your side", "No ordinary love" e "Your love is king". Eu gosto muito da música "By your side", mas n?o gosto das outras músicas dela.<br>  <br>  Obs.: Leonardo, eu acho que você está enganado! Aqui nessa biografia sobre a Sade (ver link abaixo) n?o falam sobre a morte dela. Acho que você deve estar confundindo a Sade com a Aaliyah, que é uma outra cantora negra que faleceu em um acidente de avi?o.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://territorio.terra.com.br/canais/canalpop/az/biografia.asp?artistaID=209" rel="nofollow">http://territorio.terra.com.br/canais/ca...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|LfQrTYMRaa	Gosto muito dessa cantora. A voz é aveludada, gostosa de se ouvir. <br>  Vou postar uma breve biografia:<br>  Helen Folasade Adu, mais conhecida como Sade, nasceu em 1959 (nossa dá pra acreditar?), na cidade de Ibadan, na Nigéria. Aos 4 anos se mudou com a m?e para Londres. Come?ou a gostar de música influenciada pela Soul Music e pelo Jazz, ouvindo desde muita nova artistas como Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles entre outros<br>  As músicas que mais gosto de ouvir na voz dela, s?o:<br>  Sweetest Taboo<br>  <a href="http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=qwuUuvZ4dAo" rel="nofollow">http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=qwuUuvZ4dA...</a><br>  <br>  Smooth Operator<br>  <a href="http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=GXTjSAjx27Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=GXTjSAjx27...</a><br>  <br>  Beijos|`|BCJz8r9Gaa	Ainda bem que você ressucitou ela, hehe.

Eu creio que essa diversidade de opini?es a meu respeito ocorra devido ao fato de eu mudar muito de comportamento dependendo do ambiente e das pessoas à minha volta.<br>  Quando eu estou em um ambiente com pessoas com as quais eu tenho afinidade, eu sou mais comunicativo e extrovertido; porém em outras situa??es eu sou mais reservado.<br>  Em determinadas ocasi?es, eu me sinto mais à vontade para mostrar minhas qualidades e meus talentos; porém em outras eu prefiro me expor menos.<br>  Na verdade, eu procuro sempre usar minhas qualidades nos momentos certos, porém nem sempre eu sou bem interpretado pelas outras pessoas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!|`|QTjncSZ9aa	Acho que passo de mulher vulgar para umas , bonitinha para outras e gostosa para alguns.<br>  Foi essa a impress?o que tive quando eu perguntei se a foto ficou legal aki.<br>  Mas levei na boa , n?o dá pra agradar a todos.<br>  Mas eu sou alegre e to sempre sorrindo assim como na foto, tbm sou meia muleka e a foto demonstra isso .|`|s2nznFDraa	Eu passo uma imagem séria que as pessoas confunde que sou bravo.|`|EM2ohd0naa	Imagem de uma pessoa generosa, brincalhona e séria nas horas certas.|`|QccGs3wBaa	uma menina sonhadora demais rs<br>  <br>  Bjo =)|`|KWeUC0yEaa	Passo a imagem de :<br>  <br>  - Sincera<br>  - Divertida<br>  - Safadinha<br>  - Peludinha<br>  <br>  Etc...rs<br>  |`|O2bIvfXhaa	Agora, eu diria  de SINCERIDADE.<br>  <br>  Está valendo a pena, pois até namorado já arrumei no Yahoo depois que decidi postar minha foto verdadeira e ser eumesma.<br>  <br>  Beijos Miguxa.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ybPfKs8paa	   Inteligência pura, isso assusta as pessoas, elas têm medo porque acham que vou pegá-las no próximo movimento.

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	De certa forma, sim!<br>  <br>  A mídia, as pessoas e as opini?es com certeza exercem influência na minha vida. é CLARO QUE ELAS N?O DEFINEM QUAIS SER?O AS MINHAS ESCOLHAS E ATITUDES, POIS EU TENHO OPINI?O PRóPRIA E VIS?O CRíTICA; mas as pessoas e opini?es à minha volta contribuem para a forma??o das minhas opini?es (aliás, n?o somente as minhas, mas as de todo mundo). <br>  A mídia e as pessoas com as quais convivemos exp?em exemplos de comportamento que servem de referência para nós, alguns exemplos funcionam como referência positiva (e ajudam a definir as atitudes e opini?es das pessoas) e outros funcionam como referência negativa (ajudando a definir quais atitudes n?o tomaremos e com quais opini?es n?o concordamos).<br>  Em geral, eu analiso os tipos de comportamento e opini?es à minha volta e, quando eu percebo que esse comportamento tem coisas positivas a me acrescentar, eu o adoto. O mesmo acontece com as opini?es que s?o expostas na mídia e pelas pessoas com as quais eu convivo. Se determinada opini?o tem a ver com os meus princípios e me parece sensata e inteligente, eu também a adoto. N?o acho que isso seja uma quest?o de "ficar imitando" as atitudes dos outros. Isso na verdade é uma quest?o de analisar comportamentos, opini?es e atitudes e trazer para si aqueles que têm algo de positivo a acrescentar à sua vida.<br>  <br>  Exemplo: eu gosto muito do programa "Aprendiz", da Record. Na última edi??o teve uma prova na qual os participantes tinham ir até Montevidéu e que conseguir arrecadar a maior quantidade de dinheiro possível. Um participante com o qual eu me identificava bastante teve um desempenho muito ruim na prova porque, entre outros motivos, n?o sabia falar espanhol. Ao ver isso, eu me dei conta de que o conhecimento de Língua Espanhola é muito importante e decidi me matricular numa turma de espanhol (e passei para o nível 2 com 9,5).<br>  <br>  <br>

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Olha, na verdade, a pedra filosofal n?o é cria??o da J.K. Rowling. A pedra filosofal é uma lenda que existe desde a época dos alquimistas, que sonhavam em criar a pedra filosofal para transformar qualquer tipo de metal em ouro. A J.K Rowling trouxe essa lenda para dentro do universo de Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  Quanto aos outros elementos que aparecem na novela dos mutantes (dinossauros, vampiros, ET's, zumbis etc...), n?o vejo mal nenhum em aparecerem na novela. Na história de Harry Potter, por exemplo, a autora também faz uso de vários elementos diferentes: bruxos, lobisomens, zumbis, vampiros, fadas, pedra filosofal, gigantes etc.<br>  Eu n?o sou f? da novela dos mutantes e acho Harry Potter muito melhor do que essa novela, mas n?o vejo mal algum no autor misturar criaturas fantáticas diferentes na história.<br>  Eu n?o sei qual é a rela??o que esses elementos estabelecem entre si na história da novela porque eu n?o a assisto, mas acredito que haja uma lógica para que esses criaturas todas apare?am na história.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!|`|k6C1NjjKaa	Bispo Macedo deve ter roubado de algum museu ou de algum livro de conto de fadas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?o do Juquinha.|`|w0vUBZDKaa	hehehe...pior que é verdade<br>  <br>  eu n?o sou muito chegado nessa novela<br>  <br>  o diretor pira muito errado.......ele faz uma salada com um monte de coisa<br>  <br>  sem dizer q os efeitos especiais s?o muito ruins.....<br>  <br>  parece um monte de boneco lutando.......é meio estranho<br>  <br>  Abra?o e bom final de ANO!!!|`|olz1iih9aa	Nossa!

Look closely, some will say resolved, meaning the voting is over and your answer was not picked as best.  Some will say open, meaning that other people can still answer.  Some will say in voting.  You can click on the questions and vote for the best answer.  If you think it's yours, you can vote for yourself.  That will increase your percentage.

Actually, it drives you deeper into depression|`|hL4nWbzmaa	How to avoid porn addiction on the Internet<br>  <br>  1. Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog ,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.<br>  <br>  2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov<br>  <br>  3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.<br>  <br>  4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.<br>  <br>  5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.<br>  <br>  6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stick with reputable sites.<br>  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you.

Because of an inate desire to **** anything that has a big enough hole, and the act of releasing dopamine from masterbation.<br>  <br>  But the fact is the only way to stop is to... STOP. SERIOUSLY DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOME HOMEOPATHIC SOLUTION OR OTHER BS? There are several types of men, but lets overgeneralize them into three catagories.<br>  A) Worthless scum that should be expunged from the earth<br>  B) Those who remain pure and decent but on occasion their sex drive gets in the way.<br>  C) Paradigmatic Individuals. Those who realize that their sex drive is a non-drive and as such can refrain from unhealthy sexual activity (pornography, automasterbation) and relish the healthy sex life they have instead.<br>  <br>  Obviously, looking at porn because you think that it's normal and thus acceptable makes you worthless scum. Learning to accept that you have sexual urges and choosing not to allways act upon them can bring you to B or C. Sex can be beautiful, but only from the female perspective... the typical male perspective is some perverted mishap that was unfortunate for ever existing.

BWmQGBUaaa	Saving and Putting pix on your 360 personal photos link<br>  <br>  First, save whatever image you want to use from the Internet to your computer. Right-click on the largest view of the image and choose to "Save Image As" or something similar. Make sure to observe copyright. The picture must be JPEG formatted (.jpg, .jpeg, or .jpe as the extension) and under 250KB in file size for a background or under 5MB in file size for other areas.<br>  <br>  Then, add it to your 360 space, using the following methods:<br>  <br>  On your TOP PAGE/MY PAGE:<br>  <br>  Personal Profile Pics (the "Share Photos" module on the right side is busted):<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving.<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a><br>  <br>  You can do it at least four ways in the BLOG:<br>  1) Above your entry space, click the "Browse" button for the photo upload tool. Search for the image that's saved to your hard drive. It must be a JPEG formatted image (extension ending with .jpg, .jpeg, and .jpe) and under 5 MB in file size.<br>  * The picture will appear above your entry and doing it this way, you can only use one picture.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The following methods require that your image is hosted via an online hosting service like Flickr (<a href="http://flickr.com" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com</a> ) and Photobucket (<a href="http://photobucket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/</a> ):<br>  <br>  2) Check out the 360 team post on dragging & dropping photos into blogs: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...</a><br>  * This method allows many photos to be used in an entry, with your choice in placement. Make sure that you are using an image that's on it's own page (not on a page that is shared with others). So click on the image and get to that image's full detail page (likely the largest view of the picture, not the thumbnail).<br>  <br>  3) Copy and paste an absolute URL for the image (which looks <a href="http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif</a> or .jpg....something similar to that) into a blog entry.<br>  - Check the box next "View HTML source" box (on the upper right of your entry's space).<br>  - Type in the HTML code:<br>  <img src="URL of image" height="# of pixels" width="# of pixels"><br>  NOTE: With Flickr, just use the block of code above the pic's URL that they tell you to use...wouldn't want to violate their guidelines.<br>  - Uncheck the "View HTML source" box to get back to the regular blog screen.<br>  WARNING: Do not save your entry with out adding some text.<br>  - Click "Save"<br>  * This method allows you to use any formatted image as long as it's hosted on an online server and not only your hard drive. Check each service for their list of accepted file types before choosing one.<br>  <br>  4) Slideshows:<br>  Create slideshows to embed in a blog entry and then choose to highlight the entry to make it appear on the top right side of your blog (if you like). Slideshow services: slide.com, rockyou.com, photobucket.com (although photobucket limits the number of pictures in one slideshow album), picasa.google.com:<br>  - Find the embed code for the album that you want to add.<br>  - Click on "My Blog" and create a new entry.<br>  - Type some text in the actual entry space as well, as it might not save.<br>  - Click the box next to "View HTML source" in the upper right of the entry space before adding code.<br>  - Copy the embed code and paste it into the space.<br>  - Click "Show Options" link at the bottom of the entry and click the highlight option.<br>  - Click the box next to "View HTML source" to get back to regular view if necessary. It may not show up until the entry is Previewed or Saved.<br>  - Click "Save" button and see if it appears.

A properly inserted tampon will not cause any discomfort. Here's how to comfortably use tampons.<br>  Difficulty: Easy<br>  Time Required: 5 minutes<br>  Here's How:<br>  <br>     1. Relax! Try not to worry about inserting the tampon right the first time. If you are tense it will make insertion harder.<br>     2. The best time to practice inserting a tampon is during the heavy part of your period. The tampon should glide inside your vagina easily without any discomfort.<br>     3. Decide if you prefer to insert the tampon standing or sitting. If sitting is your preference, sit on the toilet. If you want to try standing, putting one foot on the bathtub helps.<br>     4. Hold the tampon applicator in your right hand if you are right-handed, or left if left-handed.<br>     5. Use your thumb and middle finger to hold the bottom of the larger, outer tube.<br>     6. Point the tip of the applicator toward your vagina, facing slightly towards the back. The smaller tube should be pointed away from your body.<br>     7. Use your other hand to open your vagina.<br>     8. Place the tip of the applicator at the opening of your vagina.<br>     9. Gently push the smaller end of the applicator in until it is completely inside the larger outer tube. This pushes the tampon into your vagina and out of the tube.<br>    10. With your thumb and middle finger still on the outer tube, release the smaller tube and let the strings dangle freely.<br>    11. Gently pull the two tubes out together.<br>    12. Dispose of the applicator according to the manufactuer's instructions.<br>    13. When you are ready to remove the tampon, gently pull the withdrawl strings down and forward. The used tampon may be flushed down the toilet.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>     1. Lubricating the rounded end of the tampon with a water-based lubricant such as K-Y Jelly can make insertion easier the first few times. Don't use petroleum jelly.<br>     2. Always read the manufactuer's instructions throughly before using any type of tampon.<br>     3. If the tampon feels uncomfortable it is probably not inserted far enough into your vagina. Try again with a new tampon.<br>  <a href="http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/azhealthtopics/ht/How_Insert_Tamp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/azhealt...</a>|`|K1HnQAZFaa	<a href="http://www.tampax.com/howtouse.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tampax.com/howtouse.php</a><br>  <br>  That site is a great informational site about how to use tampons, reproductive health and other things.|`|op3KYhpPaa	Are you out of your mind?

6gthdHpnaa	Putting in a tampon is very easy, you can use the instructions in the box, they're easy to follow. I use Tampax Pearl, they're more comfortable to put in. Here are some instructions from ezinearticles.com:<br>  That said, the best time to practice inserting a tampon is during the heavy part of the menstrual period. As with most other feminine hygiene products, tampons come with instructional diagrams. Make sure to go over them first. Lastly, try to relax.<br>  <br>  1. Hold the tampon applicator in your right hand if you are right-handed, or left if left-handed.<br>  <br>  2. Use your thumb and middle finger to hold the bottom of the larger, outer tube.<br>  <br>  3. Point the tip of the applicator toward your vagina, facing slightly towards the back so that the smaller tube is pointing away from you.<br>  <br>  4. Open your vagina with your free hand and place the tip of the applicator at the opening of your vagina.<br>  <br>  5. Gently apply pressure on the smaller end of the applicator in until it is completely inside the larger outer tube, pushing the tampon into your vagina.<br>  <br>  6. With your thumb and middle finger still on the outer tube, release the smaller tube and let the strings dangle freely.<br>  <br>  7. Do not forget to gently pull the two tubes out together.<br>  <br>  8. The strings are used to remove the tampons after use.<br>  <br>  A properly inserted tampon should not cause any discomfort. It would be best to find a comfortable place and allot an ample amount of time to practice how to insert a tampon for the first time.|`|AA10412319	this is a retarded video...dont insert a tampon in your nose...instead put it in your vagina..good luck
vIKimNDUaa	you go to the media menu and go to pics|`|7u77AiBjaa	Since there's no link to your 360 profile in your question or Y/A profile, I can't confirm that you have one:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click the "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

7u77AiBjaa	Closing your entire Yahoo account gives you the best chance to completely remove your 360 space from the web. Closing a Yahoo account does cancel access (and for some removes associated content) to Yahoo services under that account. Otherwise, if you do not want to lose your Yahoo ID, your second-best option is content removal and permissions adjustment.<br>  <br>  So, here are your two choices:<br>  <br>  1) Go to <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...</a> and click the Account Deletion link. If you read through the text, you will find this will also delete all associated services for that account like Yahoo! Mail. I still recommend removing any content that you've added to your 360 before deleting your entire account.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If a COMPLETELY deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific).It's possible that you won't be deleted COMPLETELY from the user registration database until after 90 days.<br>  <br>  2) If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.|`|E5Cwsciyaa	I have the same question.|`|BWmQGBUaaa	To cancel your 360 page requires you to cancel your account completely. You can do so by using this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user">https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_use...</a> <br>  <br>  Before continuing, please consider the following information. <br>   <br>  By terminating this account, you will lose your Yahoo! ID, Mail address, and Profile names. We will also delete your account data and settings across the Yahoo! network. This includes the contents of your HotJobs, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Address Book, Yahoo! Small Business, Yahoo! GeoCities, Yahoo! Briefcase, My Yahoo! and more. Account deletion will also terminate any paid services that you own with this yahoo id. You may not be able to recover payments remitted for these services or the data associated with these accounts.  <br>  If you have not already done so, please verify that you have no active premium services before deleting your Account. To view and cancel your current subscriptions, visit Yahoo! Billing Information for your account, choose the "My Services" tab, and click the "Cancel" link for each subscription.  <br>  In most cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from our user registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary to discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity. Additionally, due to the limited number of names available, we may allow other users to sign up for and use your current Yahoo! ID and profile names after your account has been deleted.  <br>  Click here to learn what information may possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted. Terminating your Yahoo! Account does not alter or delete your Yahoo! People Search listing, which you need to edit or delete yourself. To satisfy terms agreed to in the Yahoo! Finance Terms of Service, personal information for users subscribed to Yahoo! Finance Premium Services will be kept by Yahoo! for at least 3 years after the subscription date.

I called the friend who 'sent' it and she confirmed that she wasn't even at her computer at the time. I Googled the address and actually found it, but the link went nowhere. I checked again today and the link on Google is gone. I don't have an answer but don't think it will mess your computer up . . . yet. What I am afraid of is that the email 'put' something in my computer and it has yet to do whatever it has been programmed to do. If anyone can figure this out, please post it! Thanks.|`|YtQLs3jAaa	I had the same thing happen in the last two days. Originally I thought it was being sent from my blackberry, but then it turned out it was not.

I have taken two actions: changed my yahoo password, deleted all contacts from address book. What else needs to be done?|`|KrwkJgOeaa	I also got it. When e-mail was sent (20:07 PM Pacific Time) I did not use the computer but it was up and running. e-mails apparently came from my address book and Java-script on my browser (Fire-Fox) was enabled. So it seems some java script was running in my browser and pulled those addresses.<br>  Yesterday I visited  motley fool (www.fool.com) and  Financial Times (www.ft.com) for the very first time. Did someone do something similar?|`|amVN4VEpaa	Same thing happened to me today. I was not even signed in when the e-mails were sent out.

Also disappointing that yahoo has not made any announcements about this at all...|`|QyrHJkJoaa	So I'm not the only one then...<br>  <br>  I sent an email to Yahoo to complain about this.

QU37MZi7aa	actually you can fake everything if that account is just for fun, or for YM. since your computer is already planted with a cookie from yahoo, delete first the cookies, delete temporary internet files, and delete browsing history, also clean your cache. after doing those, restart computer or shut down the PC and wait even at least 5minutes to lapse and turn on again the PC. this time, create an ID of your choice for your brother BUT do not give the accurate DOB (date of birth) so that it won't ask for parental control. just make all memo for the info you input in case password will be forgotten. and i think you will be successful to do that.<br>  *i created a lot of accounts using different computers with different info entered too. both are doing well, without yahoo's knowledge (perhaps) that it is just me.

Once it is installed, open your pic with it, go to "image" in the top bar, click "change size", enter the desired size, also change the DPI (dots per inch) settings to 72, then save your pic as .jpg or .gif.

oGc617Ppaa	I found a question and answer on another site that sounds similar to your problem...hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Question:<br>  <br>  When I get nervous, I get a tic that affects the left side of my face, including my eye. What can I do about this? Is there anything I can take for it?<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  <br>  This kind of problem is quite common. Without a specific description of the tic, I'll make some general observations, especially since people have different ideas of what they mean when they use the word "tic."<br>  <br>  Tics are defined as involuntary, sudden, rapid and repetitive movements. Because you describe your tic as confined to the left side of your face, I am assuming you are having what is called a simple motor tic. This kind of tic involves just one muscle group. For example, a person might have a repetitive eye blink, a shrug of the shoulders or a quick head movement.<br>  <br>  Tics do have a tendency to get worse when people are emotional — anxious, excited or angry. They can also get worse when people are fatigued.<br>  <br>  It is possible that your tic is actually a twitch, which may be a sign of a small bit of damage or irritation to one of the nerves that controls facial muscles. A twitch can also get worse when you're nervous. Twitches can occur, for example, when arthritis causes small changes in the spine. The root of the nerve may get squeezed as it comes out of the spinal cord. Make sure your doctor is aware of your symptoms.<br>  <br>  If the problem only comes on when you are nervous, then it makes sense to treat the anxiety. You could talk to a mental health professional to understand what causes your anxiety, and learn techniques to control it. If your anxiety is occasional or limited to specific situations, you might take a low dose of an anti-anxiety medication. Often a benzodiazepine like clonazepam (Klonopin) or lorazepam (Ativan) can be taken as needed. If the anxiety is related to performance situations (like public speaking), a beta-blocker, such as propranolol, may help if it is taken before you get into that situation.<br>  <br>  If you find you are almost always nervous, the annoying tic may only be a small part of your distress. In that case, you'll benefit from having the problem evaluated by a psychiatrist. Anxiety disorders are very treatable and you might get a great deal of relief.|`|xzMkUCizaa	For some reason yahoo did not show your question where it says "additional details." It only shows the heading which is the tittle or first line of your question.

The more points you accumulate, the higher your level. Yahoo!

ocjqgn6Maa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|Ofh5zBanaa	You can't pay a dealer or a person monthly. Unless you work out a deal with them, which I doubt most dealerships would do.  You got to get a loan from the bank. And you can pay them off monthly, for a few years.  But with interest rates it'll be much more expensive than it would if you just payed upfront.  Thats what I'd suggest.  Just wait till you have the money, then buy it.

They do that so they have the best answer because everyone has a thumbs down except for them."<br>  who looks at the thumbs up/down? Most people vote for the top question and leave to vote some more (you get points even if you're wrong... how awsome is that?). Truth be told, people will vote thumbs down on everyone because they think it means something... it doesn't... but it does make a frustrated person, in the face of immensly stupid (or smart) people, feel better.<br>  <br>  "Some people just like to act like jerks and they feel bigger if they make other people feel bad."<br>  I take offense at the prospect that God is talking to you. Is making this statment being a Jerk? Yes, but do I want to actually make you feel bad? Not really.<br>  <br>  (Warning... Psychobable)<br>  There is no intrinsic joy about being a jerk on the internet. One quickly discovers that although the ability to act out and not be punished for it is fun... the lack of recognition has it's consequences. Furthermore, the lack of seeing your prey react to your actions can be infuriating. The internet offers one advantage, anominity... but there is nothing else that you can get that trumps the ability to see how your actions can devistate your victim and be recongized for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And my Answers...<br>  How childish do we have to be on here?<br>  Define Yahoo: an uncultivated or boorish person<br>  <br>  COMEON, this is the INTERNET... not the hyperterminal connections which only geeks could use... the WWW, World of Weirdos and Whackos. If you expect teenagers and tweenagers to act like mature adults you are sadly mistaken.<br>  <br>  <br>  "this is suppose be a place to get advice and ask questions."<br>  No, this is a place to make fuss' and declare war. Most people on YA are just Wikidiots (I.E. people who think that reading wikipedia is equivalant to having a PhD)... others are overconfident college students *raises hand*. And worse yet are the overconfident idiotic teenagers who think that telling a girl who is obviously starving herself to "drink less water" is an intelligent response. [Then again, I could have been wrong but she made several notes about her weight and also said she felt sick most of the time... and was asking if drinking water (because it had zero calories [sic]) was making her sick.]<br>  Unfortunatly, because it is the internet, you'll get more ignorant people than intelligent people... and as such you'll have people doing ignorant things (such as telling a suicidal person to "get a life"). That is why I prefer asking real people my real questions... but right now? I probally have some psych problems that can be allievated by either distraction or agression... (or possibly feeling superior over others)<br>  <br>  <br>  "We don't have to be so icky about the whole thing. If you don't want to ask or answer question then don't, you don't need to go through and mark everyone as being wrong (not liking their answer)."<br>  <br>  This wasn't a question but... the point of yahoo answers is the point system. If it was just answering questions there would be no need for it... but the reality is people care more about lots of points and lots of best answers (which they get by voting for themselves) and those STUPID contributer tags... then actually answering questions. I remember when I THROUGHLY discredited global warming advocates... and some top contributer idiot used a junk reply. Half a page of utter worthless nonsense. I then posted a question asking him to explain the nonsense he posted and his reply was his same junk reply (and some insinuation that he was smarter than I and that he knew what he was talking about).|`|0haWIfVMaa	That is exactly what I am thinking.|`|52otNiElaa	We all don't have the same answers.

If you don't want the account either, then don't sign in to it any more, Yahoo will delete it after 4 months of inactivity, non use. But only if you don't log on. Just mark the unwanted email as Spam if it is in your inbox. If it's in the spam bin, just empty it. Never open them, it sends a message back that your account is active then you get tons more.

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	The major reason that yahoo have the limits on the lower levels is to prevent malicious users from flooding the site with their posts. These include spammers and other advertisers (there are even auto-posting bots that do it), trolls, and other abusers.<br>  It also helps new users to take it slow and "learn the ropes" as they progress up the levels. And helps new users to understand how YA is supposed to work.|`|hd442Ha5aa	The reason why there's a limit is because Y!A wants to make sure that you aren't going to ask retarded questions or post the same question over and over again like most have done.

You can have fun, but the functional part has to come first.  Imagine questions where 50-100 people were having "fun" answering it.  The asker would get nothing useful.  And who gets to say what is "fun".  Is "that is stupid" or "do your own homework" fun?  They are not functional for sure.  It would still be Yahoo who makes the decision.  They have set the ground rules and they are judge and jury as to how they work.  The person who reported you may have been insulted by your "fun" answer.  It happens all the time.  Emotions do not show through the internet.  If you want fun there are thousands of chat rooms and dizzay.com for a YA equivalent clone fun site.  Let the users of YA have a site where they can exchange knowledge without all the fun.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Yes, some people are very report happy on here.

0cf4Qja5aa	Hi Casey!  I'm new at this myself however I think it is (with out wanting to sound to fuzzy!) about the process.  I  don't advise this however, I have made my profile transparent my IM and email address are readily available and I haven't received any "hater mail so far".    It's the process of your choice of answers and the research your experience and abilities can bring to the table. The use of spell check, grammar function, wikipedia, (not the most accurate, however).    The point is "the process" of research, communicating an idea in a short amount of time and the bonus is maybe just maybe you've actually chosen a question where someone actually needs and will appreciate the information and the effort shown by someone that they will probably not meet in this life time.    Have to admit having to hold back from becoming mean spirited and taking a "Flame Thrower" to some of the people asking irrelevant questions.    So, I wouldn't hold my breath for that Lexus swag from Yahoo, just download the screen saver and take what you can get from the experience.    My grammer ,punctuation and spelling are so in need of help.  I'm trying to use my window word\ cut and paste after  completing an answer from now on!  I think you become lazy when you see how low the bar is on some of the Q&A's, there is no reason for it with all this tech at your fingertips, it is what is referred to in life as "The Peter Princple".  Look that up on Wikipedia and it will have you looking at all the professionals you deal with on a daily bases with a whole different attitude, espeacially doctor's who may be affected by it.    Down loaded this little tid bit from Wikipedia for myself.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inte...    Cut and pasted from top contributor "Awsome" didn't know you could do that? YOU CASEY!

There are 7 levels to Y!A.   Level 7 starts at 25,000 points.  It's been acheived in less than a month, but the average is 4 - 6 months.  I reached it in 11 weeks.      All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|wxOO8A8eaa	This is just for fun.

If it does not, the only other options are to add the link with SPACES and ask people to remove them, or use one of the sites that 'shrinks' URLs into shortened versions and use that version of the link.

To remedy this problem, simply ask or answer the question without the link, and add it as additional details or edit it into the answer after the question has been asked.

hJAtgbb8aa	You cannot know if you are a good or bad reporter by any other method. There is no meter or status that you can view to see your influence over the community.    But one way you can find out if you are a trusted reporter is that check how long does it take for a post to be removed after you delete it.  For that, save the question in your watchlist before you report it.  After a report, keep an eye on it. If the question is immediately removed, you can take the hint that you are a trusted reporter.    If it is not removed instantly, then you have to report more accurately.  But do not report unnecessarily to gain influence...and never report one user more than 5 times a day or Yahoo! will block your reports (as in your reports won't be verified).

spFmMOL2aa	post counts in yahoo answers are very important to the ad department. <br>  <br>  the more "questions" posted ( no matter how stupid) the more money they get for the stupid ads that clog up the pages.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Many people don't read the answers already given before they answer themselves.<br>  <br>  Also, when a question first posts, everyone on the category homepage sees it at the same time.

Some might give a short simple answer ... those post first.  Others give more detail, and their answers take longer to type out ... so more answers post, but they say essentially the same thing as the earlier answers.<br>  <br>  If answers post within just a few minutes of each other, I always assume those answerers were all typing at the same time and were unaware of each others' answers.

(least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.    2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays. Again, if you follow the direction in  1 above, you can sometimes get around it.

K5IOSGXAaa	First things first. Go to the ebay site and read the information there about buying. Then, in order to purchase on ebay, you will need to set up a paypal account. Again, go to paypal and read about setting up an account and all the information there. Once you have gotten your paypal account okay, then you just go on ebay with your account ( log in ) and when you find something you are interested in, look at the seller's feedback and make sure they have good feedback ( not a lot of negatives - you can read each one if you want) and if you have ANY questions about the item or shipping etc. ASK the seller first before placing a bid or if it is a "buy it now" item, purchasing the item. Once you win the item or purchase it, the buyer will send you an invoice, you pay from that. Wait for them to send it to you. Make sure you have read the entire ad and check out what type of shipping is going to be used so that you have a good idea of how long it should take for your item to arrive once you pay for it. Once you receive the item and are satisfied with it, leave feedback for the seller. If you have any problems with the transaction, contact paypal and let them know because you are covered by them if the sale doesn't go through as it should or you don't receive the item etc.

ErtMD5NZaa	I get mine from CoastalContacts.com - they are a good price and have been around forever, so you know it is a safe site. I would not recommend 1800contacts because they are the most expensive website out there! Plus it is a big pain to do returns there in case they send you the wrong item...|`|3OHCscEbaa	welcome to visit our website.thank you!|`|E5qAD48Iaa	i started ordering from 1-800-contacts. you can order online or by phone. the best part is that if u don't know the prescription they'll get it. and if u forget where or who ur doc is, the site will help u to locate them just by general location. way cheap & fast delivery. i placed my order on a tues late at night and had mine by friday afternoon.
