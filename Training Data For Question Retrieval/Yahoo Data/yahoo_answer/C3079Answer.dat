FDvrB8kgaa	FIRST OF ALL! Do your research, 93.3 couldn't cut it anymore so they layed of all their employees, and Univision a big spanish corporation took over the radio station, especially for a city where more of its population is Hispanic!|`|bSiNAsHJaa	i have no idea... this really sucks.. did they relocate again...|`|n3cN61enaa	yeah man the mexicans took over just like 104.9|`|t9WaAyWgaa	well that is crazy because I was really starting to enjoy that station. that is the same thing that happened with 104.9|`|y3qZxnVsaa	Mexicans are taking over everything. Might as well move to Mexico, while they're all over here.

spFmMOL2aa	Cities are safe.. your growing awareness is only matched against your naivete.|`|ogzNso0Maa	I do agree that it is pathetic that every Canadian city is growing in crime rate. Even small little villages are much more violent then they used to be. You really can sum it up when you say I only hear bad news on the radio these days, because it is true! However, as humans we over analyze the situation, so are cities might not be bad, as new york per say, but they still can be filled with violence crime and hate.<br>  <br>  Jordan.
gzaVGE4Qaa	Go into any pawn shop or used record shop. You'll always need an ID to sell.<br>  <br>  They will pay you crap though, you're better off selling on eBay or amazon.com. They'll probably only givve you a couple of dollars per DVD, even the brand new ones still in the plastic. Pawn shops prey on people needing quick money.

Qeor2wKLaa	law schools do not  require an A level law to gain admission. When you study law you will cover the stuff you would have done at A level.<br>  <br>  Broaden your education. do something other than Law A level.|`|SzqQcGPfaa	If im honest, Universities sometimes prefer people without a Law A-Level and who is eager to learn that a A grade LAw students who thinks they know it all.<br>  <br>  89% Law students go into a Law degree without an A-Level.<br>  <br>  Choose a subject you enjoy that will get you a good grade. History is a good one for Law.
AgBH66nJaa	Yes you will get something in Primark with that money and it does sell lots of leopard print stuff, it's also really good for jewellery, bags and belts.<br>  If you are looking for cheap make-up go to H&M, they do really cheap make up but it's really good!<br>  <br>  Good Luck xx|`|27bou3SBaa	you could find a pretty dress for that much :)<br>   & yes, primark does sell makeup and leopard print stuff :)|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yes they do!! <br>  Lots of stuff like that, and yes they sell leapord print. <br>  Primark is a good idea for a cheap dress.|`|3iTmXKImaa	you will probably find something nice to wear on a night out, but the quality will not be great, but then if its just to wear going out occasionally it should be fine.<br>  i think they do sell make up sets, but really would not buy them, there is a difference between cheap clothes and cheap makeup, you could end up with a rash or worse!<br>  have a great night :)|`|zll28kQ1aa	Gosh Girl where have you been?<br>  <br>  never set foot in primark?! Lool<br>  <br>  yes primark is good for lepord print<br>  <br>  but the only make up item i would<br>  <br>  recomed from there is the lipgloss.<br>  <br>  (all the make up is located where you<br>  <br>  que up to pay)|`|mhdBzYi4aa	primark sell some make-up but not much.<br>  the also sell accesories.<br>  and they dont have much leopard print in at the moment.<br>  i think you will almost definately get something nice for ￡18!<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]

3mAgM405aa	Here's a $15-17 per hour night job which is readily available.  Unfortunately, it is not well publicized.<br>  <br>  Check out your local alarm home/commercial provider and ask them if there are openings for an alarm console monitor in which you keep track of any alarms that go off and call the owner's phone to find out why the alarm was going on.  And also obtain from the owner the special password to indicate that no one had access to his alarm system.  And if everything fails, you are responsible for calling in a private patrol service which will visit the alarmed home to check it out.  It's an on-the-job training position which requires that you have a clear unaccented voice and can at least operate a computer with some typing speed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DqUf3LM8aa	Bartender, exotic dancer, waiter, club promoter, babysitter.|`|efe012ef8f0a9e71356ba0a749939144aa	UPS<br>  24 Hour Walmart Stocking<br>  24HourFitness Janitorisl/Desk<br>  Newspaper Thrower<br>  Yahoo Customer Service...

Ive been thinking about maybe buying a performance autoparts company, I know I'd either consider sponsoring a car, or would want to be able to point drivers in the right direction if I owned it.|`|cs4n4Fgzaa	Go to the businesses in your community and talk to the manager or owner. Make sure they know how it will benefit them - free advertising and community reputation.|`|uCqxkEhUaa	The best way is to write a bunch of letters to local businesses.  Almost all will at least respond.

If you are that young most businesses require a work permit from your high school.<br>  <br>  I know that you can start working at grocery stores at 14.<br>  <br>  You should try and sell some things you don't need if you need cash.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0boTBFEVaa	hello yeah you are going to need a work permit and you will need to fight for a job along with grown ups as well atlanta right now is going thru a hard time but if you really do want a job I have tips for a interview in my blog it will show you how to act in a interview hope i helped <br>  <a href="http://economyhelp.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://economyhelp.blogspot.com/</a>
