GrhBvUEEaa	Well, in favor of the Japanese, keep straight lines and simplicity in mind. Try to keep furniture simple and matching. But when punking it up, try really funky colors and patterns in mind, but tasteful to emulate a Kimono into the mix. When getting wall decor, go for flowers and nature like, but get it like in bizarre setting, (Warhol i think). i think that would help.
kYcRLr0Naa	It's not too late to plant bulbs. You just need to know which types can be planted in spring. You could even hire me as your gardener. LOL. I'm in NY and I plant dahlia tubers, lilies, and gladiolas in the spring. I'm sure you can do the same. You can even start them in pots indoors to get them started. I do that with my dahlia tubers. In fact I keep them dry over the winter, spritzing them now and then so they don't shrivel up too much. Get a book and read up on it so you'll know what to do and ask a local nursery for advice. Impatiens do well in partial shade. I love the New Guinea impatiens with their brite flourescent colors!|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I would wait and see what was planted before you moved there before planting anything. I would just buy baskets of fresh flowers and put them outside until you know what is planted. I would buy ones that had bulbs or something you could replant after the blooms died.<br>  I would check with books or your local garden store for what would grow best in your zone..I would check out all kinds of colors and flowers.

I can't wait!|`|AA12150589	Well, garden centers and home improvement stores, like Home Depot and Lowe's, will soon have plants that you can just put into the ground.

If you have a lot, you could spray it on, I would suggest full strength, good old bleach.|`|lBRud4y5aa	Wickes do a moss/algae killer. You just brush it on and go off and have a pint (of beer). Don't pressure wash it off as you will wash off the chemical.|`|98p5v51zaa	Take a lawn sprayer {usually used for weed killer} mix a mixture of 25% to 75% bleach to water.

qEqMRTQkaa	Best thing to use is a sharp wood chisel 3/4 to 1 inch width.  Best caulk to use is 100% silicone bath & kitchen caulk.|`|UADLdXBtaa	go to the caulking aisle at the hardware store. They have little tools that have hooks on the ends (usually plastic) that when you drag it along the hardened caulk it will just peel off easily. You should look for a caulk that is specifically for tub and tile. It usually says it right on the tube. Then use one of those tools like the pro caulk kit to smooth it out.|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	A bevy of razor sharp tools is the place to begin. Box knives,of many different sizes and point-shapes,along with utility razor blades, are best at getting through the many types of caulking. If you are stripping away a tub shelf-dress like you are taking a bath. Cover the drain with a cheese cloth and use dish soap to lubricate the razors. Very bright lighting is very good for great success. Practice with these sharp instruments is good before you dive into the actual work. Once you start the work, be mindful of what you're doing and skip past what perplexes you. Come back to these 'puzzles' after you have thought-out a safe way to address them. A wet towel,to stand on, is a nice way to begin the work.|`|QjK16ibkaa	Im not sure what the best caulk to use is, but as far as removing it from around the tub, i just chisel one end up with a scraper, and then slowly peel it off. If it breaks while your peeling, just scrape off another little section to get started and continue. Maybe baby oil would work for softening it up a bit, Ive never personally tried it, but I know it works good for removing most sticky substances. Good luck|`|7faa830a5f484403e6668e99c4253665aa	When I am faced with task such as these - I always do the best thing.<br>  Pay some kid to do the work.<br>  <br>  I think you will have to use a paint scraper to wedge the caulk out.|`|Od4LBqHyaa	<a href="http://www.askthebuilder.com/229_Caulk_Removal.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.askthebuilder.com/229_Caulk_R...</a>

Without telling us the model I can't tell you.  <br>  <br>  On the whirlpools with the controls on the top rear back of the fresh food section the time is usually located behind that control panel, close to the thermostat.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Simple, just block off the vent. I would remove the cover and fit a chunk of cardboard and maybe some of that silvery bubble wrap stuff so no heat or cold seeps through then seal the doors as well then post a mean pit bull at the door so none of the kids run in and out. They open the door and lose a limb. ;) That'll teach em. LOL|`|AA10092387	I have to say yes it is ok. I have two rooms that I do it with all the time.<br>  It will not hurt anything. <br>  So close the vent and close the door to the room.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Yes. Just disconnect the duct going to that room and cap it off.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	yes but closing means more backpressure on the system.|`|98p5v51zaa	Yes, it's O.K. to do this. I would suggest rather than just closing the register opening at the room which is not the best seal. It would be better to trace the duct work back and see if there's a damper installed you can than close the damper for this line and it will cut off all flow through this duct.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	you can buy a magnetic cover for very cheap.|`|VsMtCrk7aa	Yes, close the vent in the room.|`|ww12lItvaa	I tell my customers that closing off one room is generally okay if the furnace and ducting system is designed well enough for the system. <br>  <br>  I do find cases where the furnaces are close to overheating that even closing one vent will cause them to overheat and limit out (off). But that is an oversized unit and not too common. <br>  <br>  But be aware it will save you only "some" as heat from the other rooms will still migrate in to that room and it also makes the house a little draftier. The adjacent walls will be cooler.|`|UQWusO1waa	just put some barrier behind  behind the vent( like cardboard), and if there is another vent in the room for return air, block that off too.The air will just go to the other rooms in the house.

Also check into a local farmers market or vegetable growing clubs/organizations for advice. Some of those groups have plant swaps, advice days and or give plants for free if they have an abundance of one type.|`|OQeXXvaPaa	First you should plan out your area, then either turn the dirt, or if it has grass on it, you could take the grass and use it to start a compost pile (if you want the best and cheapest dirt). if you are planning on having irrigation, you could use a pump and pipe.

g7uMKvEzaa	I am not sure, depends on how much you feed and water it and how much light it gets. I think they do need lots of room for their roots. I would look up info in a garden book or on yahoo search or google.

I move them outside after all danger of frost is past and back in usually on Labor Day weekend.  It is a bear to move them in and out!!  I also have other pears, apples and cherries planted outside and so I do get a good pollination.  <br>  <br>  But they all produce fruit every year and though I do have to throw nets over them so that the birds don't get it all!!  Mainly I think you need to make sure they are dwarf trees and also that you have the ability to 'move' them.  Mine sit on a platform of 2x4s underneath a 1/2 plywood and they are on heavy duty casters.  Depending on the kind of pear it needs to be with 'another pear' lol to have pears fruit.<br>  <br>  Also I use Miraclegro plant food Every time I water.  They are in a high organic soil with about 4 inches of gravel in the bottom and diameter of the containers is 40 inches.  The containers sit in a large heavy plastic container to catch the water.  They are about 30 inches high and are redwood - in which I lined with a double layer of heavy mil plastic poking a hole in the bottom.  Do not overwater.  You are watering too much if the water is standing in the catch basin around the base of the container.  I let them dry out thoroughly before watering again and then soak them - so I end up watering every 3-4 weeks in the wintertime (the are in a cool area that gets about 5 hrs of sun in the afternoon when they are inside and I water much more often in the summer when they are outside - about every 1-1/2 weeks to 2 weeks.  They are in more sunlight in the spring and summer - about 6-7 hrs per day.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	It would need more room for its roots.

FlsrXuJOaa	I loved Eileen's suggestions. One of them she mentioned was an ornamental pear. I recommend Chanticleer (also called Cleveland Select). It has beautiful white blooms in the spring, a nice thick glossy leaf in the summer and a lovely reddish fall color. They also grow tall but not very wide, in an upright oval shape. A similar-looking tree is a Spring Snow Crabapple. Very disease resistant, the white flowers in the spring smell amazing! <br>  <br>  I would also suggest some trees with beautiful fall color. A Brandywine red maple is a seedless variety (so no annoying helicopters=less mess) and has a spectacular deep red fall color. It is one of my very favorite trees. Also grows fairly quickly, so you can start with a small size. <br>  <br>  good luck :) I think it's really great that you are getting your school involved with such a neat project. It's cool that you are doing this as a freshman so you can see your trees grow!|`|g7uMKvEzaa	What a cool thing to be doing.

Good way to change the look of your room because covers can be comparatively cheap.
AA11759897	As boswell says the air vent is blocked but no need to drain down, presumably if its a combi you have pressure in the system or the feed and expansion tank is full on a conventional system, First  close both valves on the radiator and then with protection for furnishings remove the air vent bleed pin and using a needle insert it in the vent hole to clear blockage. as there will be pressure in the radiator it will squirt out  and depending how much air is in the radiator dirty water may follow. Replace the bleed screw open the valves and then finishing the bleeding of the radiator as normal.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Maybe the air bleed valve is blocked. Take the middle part of the valve right out. Thats the part you turn with the key. poke a bit of wire or a thin knitting needle into the hole to clear any sludge which might have built up, but be prepared for a lot of water to come out when you do so, so don't drop the valve on the floor and lose it!    Secondly the rad itself might be sludged up in which case it will have to come off and be washed through with a hose. Lastly the outlet valve may be partly closed.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Check the water pressure on your boiler.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	If its a steam system then you don't want water in it. But if it's water check your pipes, etc for level. Water seeks its own level and not that of a radiator. You could have a blockage somewhere too or a lose fitting on the farther side of the whole thing and if its a lose fitting the pressure will seep out there.<br>  Rots o ruck.|`|lBRud4y5aa	Low water pressure. If a combi, there should be at least 1 bar on the boiler gauge. If you have a hot water cylinder in an airing cupboard you need to visit the loft to make sure the little tank contains water. Sometimes the ball valve sticks in the closed position, so wiggle it (the ball valve).|`|0CNaq92taa	The hole in the air vent is blocked.You need to drain the system,remove the vent pin and clear the vent with a sewing needle.|`|4njcFBNhaa	I'd try bleeding them all. maybe air trapped in other radiators in the house stopping it circulating.|`|8BHJ1obLaa	must be a blockage either in the pipes  or the radiator , suggest you get a plumber.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	It could be a bad valve.

I bought it 14 years ago at a hardware store.|`|ZYqpXJlQaa	Is the shower head the only problem with pressure loss?  Does water still flow from the faucet while using the shower?  You could try replacing the shower head.  Or if is a newer one then it will have a device that decreases the water flow and there for the pressure.  All this device is is a peace of cardboard, sometimes plastic, with a hole pocked in the middle of it.  Remove that and you should have a lot more pressure from the shower head.  They are there to decrease water flow and the amount of water used.  All new shower heads are required to have them, but they are removable.  If you want to replace the faucet and cannot find another one similar to the one you have, the you will have to hire a plumber to run a new pipe up to your shower head.  This may require cutting a hole in your wall.
omegLbOAaa	change the color. it's one of the easiest & cheapest things to do.<br>  <br>  play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes.

lwJb9NUEaa	Well you can bunk your beds (don't worry not juvenile at all, all my buddies in college did it) Then use some shelves, keep some stuff under the bed and organize your closet well. Things that stack and have space under them work really well. <br>  <br>  I know it might be awhile but in the fall there is always a "off to college" sale at your local target or walmart or whatever and they always have really great items that save space and are very stylish too!<br>  <br>  (good luck!)|`|UQWusO1waa	she has to sleep on the couch and keep her clothes in the food pantry.

IKEA has some great storage, and space saving options. if you can, go to the nearest store, and look at how they have their display rooms set up. it will give you ideas. also mirrors make a room seem larger, and im sure full length mirrors would be put to good use in a girls room, anyway. and if you keep the room clean and keep things off the floor, that will help, too. hope that helps|`|GlwaZGr1aa	Well...it would def. help if we knew how old the 2 or u r.  <br>  <br>  But...growing up, I had to share a room with my sister as well.

Borrow a high pressure water blaster and clean all the steps, then grab some concrete paint and paint the steps. <br>  <br>  The house could use a coat of paint too, but I understand if that's a bigger job than you want to tackle, but it'd be worth it, and look brand new. Then plant some flowers, or some shrubs, or both. <br>  <br>  Grab some contrasting coloured bricks, like red which another person suggested.  I usually like to make things look symmetrical, so each side of the steps should look the same. Or maybe plant yourself a climber like wisteria. It could look amazing. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bc2c20578f51c5d8576556ddbba6f0a2aa	yeah deff clean all that stuff away. i wish the pictures had been taken a little further back to get more of a view of the layout.<br>  <br>  i say see if you can build out the flower beds to be the same size on either side. i'd use landscape ties to build up with since they are about $2-3 at lowes. <br>  <br>  my thoughts would be to put in some dahlias, gerberas, callibrachoa million bells, jumbo purslane and fill in with some asparagus fern.

l3ZQqY0Iaa	The extremely fast growing trees that you've listed have shorter life spans, 10 to 30 years. Of the trees on your list the Theves hybrid popular is less prone to disease than Lombardy.  Aspen (also in the poplar family) has  more than its share of disease and insect problems even at your altitude.  They can be dealt with, but it is a continuing job.  I like the Autumn Blaze Maples.

Exposing yourself to radiation is nothing to play around with...<br>  <br>  Secondly, a little science lesson. <br>  <br>  A microwave doesn't produce hot air like a traditional oven. It produces MICROWAVES that excite water molecules in food to heat it up.

l3ZQqY0Iaa	Take a soft wood cutting in late spring, actually take several because the success rate will be on the low side.  Start small, a terminal bud and 2 or 3 laterals is plenty. Use a rooting hormone per instructions, pot them in a sterile commercial potting mix and keep them moist.  Your can use plastic bags over the cuttings to act as mini-greenhouses, keep them out of direct sun.  Once you have them started you can begin the Bonsai process.  Most any trees or shrubs can be grown as Bonsai subjects, it is a method of growing not a separate type of plant.  It is a slow job so you'll have plenty of time for research.  Pears tend to prefer classical but you could try 'Us and Them' with the London Philharmonic.|`|pQxuZY5Paa	as previously stated taking a clipping and getting the roots to start with a rooting hormone is the best way. <br>  <br>  Bonsai loosely translated is "tree in a pot" so any tree in a pot is a bonsai. Heres the catch, Smaller leaves and good taper. <br>  <br>  If you have a 1 foot tall tree with 6 leaves that are 5 inches across it will not look like a " tree in the distance" The art is very fun and you will be learning about bonsai by doing the pear without spending hundreds of dollars.<br>  <br>  Todd|`|QB0CnrmJaa	DO NOT keep it in just plain water! You will drown the stem. So cut a stem off with the clippers and place it in some soil. You can't necessarily "bonsai" a plant/tree, but it will grow another pear tree.<br>  <br>  Just put it in soil as you normally would, cut side down. Water, and sunlight, and you have a tree, not a bonsai.
zM9Lj21waa	have the firebox and flues checked out ...if it originally burnt wood and everything is in good shape, there is no reason it cant burn wood again...just have the line capped or use the gas for a starter...a fireplace wont get hot enough to melt steel pipe...|`|yWUQUjx9aa	I had the same situation in my house.  I hate gas fireplaces.  They worry me.  I feared someone would play with the valve and cause gas to leak into the house.  It is easy to convert it back.  Just follow the gas line away from the fireplace.  Find a valve you can turn off and then start dismantling the piping that goes to the fireplace.  Make sure you have someone inspect your chimney before you use your fireplace to burn wood again.  It may need to be cleaned.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	no.  common sense. no.|`|tIg3low2aa	No!  It has to be converted to wood burning first!|`|PaFkPZlYaa	DONT DO IT! i previously had a house fire not to long ago because of that exact reason.|`|BuP1JlIxaa	why it's gas, you don't need wood.|`|AA10097817	Check with your local fire chief, fire marshal or fire department. They will be happy to steer you in the right direction.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	You really should have a wood stove/fireplace professional come out and take a look at the system. It might be as easy as removing the insert and gas line. But you don't want to take a chance of melting the gas valve and causing a fire or explosion.
AA10232434	of course, as long as it is GFCI protected. bathrooms must be on it's own separate circuit, not shared with other rooms.<br>  <br>  you can have more than one outlet/receptacle, but the GFCI will protect everything downstream from it|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Can't imagine why you'd need more than one GFI in a bathroom, most only have one outlet as it is.   A GFI will control a whole circuit, like a breaker, if it's the first recept on the circuit.   If it's the last on the circuit, then it only controls itself.|`|jcauTPLZaa	If  you have more than one outlet on the same circuit, then find the first one in the run and install the GFCI there, make sure to put the line on the line side and the load on the load side. The GFCI will protect all the other circuits downstream from that one. If you have more than one circuit in your bathroom than you need to have a GFCI protecting each circuit. New homes, or complete remodel jobs must have a separate circuit for the bathrooms, but all the bathrooms can be on the same circuit. You can do this two ways individual GFCI's or by using a GFCI breaker for the circuits. Despite what was said earlier, you can have more than one GFCI on a circuit, they will work, its just over kill and a waste of money. You can have as many outlets in a bathroom as you want to feed, just as long as they are protected by a GFCI.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	You can have as many GFCI receptacles in a bathroom as you want, but each one needs to be on it's own dedicated circuit breaker with a dedicated hot wire, neutral ground, and earth ground run directly to it from the electric panel.  A GFCI will protect up to 15 or 20 amps of electricity, depending on the receptacle and the circuit breaker, so there's rarely a need for more than one circuit.  If you just need more than 2 places to plug things in (i.e. rechargeable razors and toothbrushes  on both sides of the vanity for a master bedroom), then you can install a dedicated circuit and run it to the first outlet, connect the wires from the panel to the 'Line' terminals on the GFCI receptacle, and then run another wire from the 'Load' terminals to the other outlet location, where it will connect to a regular receptacle like in the rest of the house.  Anything connected to the 'Load' terminals will be protected because it will feed through the GFCI receptacle on the other side of the vanity.  Just make certain that you connect the hot wire to the brass colored terminal and the neutral ground to the silver colored terminal and the bare or green wire to the green ground screw on the receptacle.  If a GFCI receptacle is not wired exactly right, it won't work at all.  When in doubt, read the directions! :-)|`|0h9aD7Toaa	yes you can, the electrical code didn't used to say only one electrical outlet.|`|o0oYsQM7aa	You can only install one GFIC per circuit. Anymore and they murder/suicide.

WtqsWctjaa	If the tile is stuck to plywood. Chip out a single row of tile down the length of the floor and another row across the width, with the intersection of the two rows somewhere in the middle of your floor. This will expose the plywood underlayment. Now fit a reciprocating saw with a 12-inch-long wood-cutting blade and make a shallow plunge cut into the plywood. Just as the blade starts to cut through the plywood, pull the saw toward you and make a continuous, low-angle cut just through the plywood underlayment, not the subfloor. (As awkward as a reciprocating saw may seem, a circular saw is actually harder to control and kicks up too much dust.) Once you've finished the cut, work your flatbar under the underlayment and rip it up, tile and all.<br>  <br>  Tile that's attached to cement backerboard needs the same kind of treatment as tile stuck to plywood. Just use a recip saw with a carbide-grit masonry cutting blade and work in one small area at a time. If the backerboard is glued down, the plywood subfloor may be damaged during the removal process. Any panels that are damaged will have to be ripped out and replaced.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I'm afraid you're just going to have to do it the old-fashioned way. It's unlikely that the tile will come up whole, but you may get a few like that. Mostly, you just have to hammer and chisel away at it. Get some friends to help you, wear eye protection, and pay them with pizza and beer at the end of the day!|`|8apA3Rffaa	Cement board will look grey in color and have a nylon mesh as a top layer.
