I don't know if it's right but I know it doesn't look right and when kids see this they are confused. <br>  <br>  I know gays and lesbians want to be accepted as they are, I agree but I also think they should keep their intimacy behind closed doors. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, just as everyone else said, they are just as human as we are.|`|7309d2c74c1da4cd96135175d9c855a9aa	I personally don't care what people do behind closed doors as long as it is consentual, but... keep it behind those doors.

I want you to talk, but not right now She pushed Shinos coat open and gazed hungrily at his finely sculpted chest. Delicious She ran her hand down his body, causing Shino to shiver. Mmm, Shino, youre magnificentperfect Her delicate fingers brushed over his nipples, making Shino shiver again. I can feel you shivering She giggled and pinched his nipples. A small gasp, barely audible, escaped from Shinos lips. I heard than, Airi sang.<br>  Airi quickly looked up at Shino, then turned her focus back to his chest. She leaned closer and sighed. There was that scent. That certain scent that always made Airi feel comfortable. That certain scent that helped her sleep at night. That certain scent that she couldnt get out of the apartment. Shinos cologne. She remembered when she bought that cologne for Shino for his twenty-third birthday a few months ago. Twenty-three years old. That had know each other for seven years and when they were finally reunited again, they got a cozy apartment together, and during the months up til now, they neverwellthey never had a midnight expression of love. Yes, they slept in the same bed, but they never did anything. Shino would just hold Airi in his strong arms until she fell asleep. (His intoxicating cologne helped.) Airi looked up at Shino once more. I want to see your eyes. I dont want you hiding behind those really cool sunglasses. She removed the sunglasses and set them aside on a small table nearby. Okay, here we go, she said, mostly to herself.<br>  Airi continued to rub Shinos nipples, then stuck out her tongue. Pressing her tongue against Shinos warm chest, she licked the area between his two nipples. Shino closed his eyes and exhaled. The feeling waspleasant. After a few licks, Airi stopped rubbing Shinos right nipple and lightly ran her tongue over it. Shino closed his eyes tighter and opened his mouth just a bit. She massaged the pink bud with her tongue until it was hard, then turned her attention to the other neglected nipple. Shinos mouth opened slightly, then closed again. He tried to control his body, but his will was failing him slowly. He took a deep breath, but it only helped a little. There was a warm swelling in his pants that he felt. Non-notnot now He opened his eyes, blinked, then squeezed them shut. The swelling wasnt going to go away. It was too late, he was already aroused.<br>  There, thats better. Nice and hard, Airi said with a grin as she pulled off of Shinos left nipple and gave it a pinch."|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	It has something to do with $100, payable in cash or check|`|Zky0yJqCaa	The prelude to THO's|`|EZyHOht7aa	You made this up.

zs4pFVpCaa	your best bet would probably be to go to a pawn shop and see what's there. often times you'll find diamonds in the rough. I bought my alvarez acoustic for $50 and got it set up for me for another $25. If you don't want to go that route, yamaha and fender make guitars for under $300. Just know that they have a really annoying plastic-y sound to them. Good luck

gYEojWk8aa	I believe that Danny is the best singer yet ever on American Idol. I think they should just start making records for him now! I was shocked when Chris Daughtry got voted off but if Danny got voted off i think American Idol would go doooown.. and he has only been live one time! Anyone who says he is just a sob story is jealous that he has a great voice and he is doing this for his wife and not some stupid annoying person trying to be funny like some of the people who audition. I love Danny Gokey and I hope he is the next American Idol!|`|AU1mqWfJaa	I really don't think of him as a great singer cuz he isn't ...and i do think his sob story got him thur ...i  like him though ...something bout the dude that just reels you in ...Not the next AI though...that will be taken by the one and only Adam Lambert! lol<br>  <br>  I really thought Anoop was goin to be choosen last nite but he wasn't ..oh well ...better luck next time.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	There is something about him that strikes me as insincere.

Yes, he has a really sad story, but that's not what's keeping him in the competition.  His amazing voice and humble attitude is what's drawing the attention of the viewers and judges.  He had the best performance by far on Tuesday night and I can DEFINITELY see him as a recording artist.  I'm sure he'll go far in this competition.|`|ztug2gLjaa	I think he's a good singer and cute on top of that.  You know how American Idol is where they do sob stories on a bunch of people.  It's just to get more advertisement.  More money!!!|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	I think he has the whole package--the looks, the style, the personality, and HE CAN SING!

A boy came out to his parents and said Jacko touched him.... so they went to the police and then he was on trial....<br>  <br>  <br>  It was about just what you asked.... Child Molestation...... no one knows for sure what happened.... but M.J. is a bit if not totally off....  and his bizarre antics and actions where more fuel for the trial and case.... as well as the fact he seemed to only invite over little boys....<br>  <br>  Also the whole thing could have just been about $$$$$$|`|cRhkkBAEaa	Well, some idiots took advantage of his kindness and wanted some money off him.<br>  The first one in 1993 he was accused by a boy and his dad. The boys mother did NOT think that MJ had done anything to her son. The father was recorded saying something like 'If I get through with this it'll ruined Jackson's career and we'll have everything we wanted' or something along those lines. Michael got really ill with it all and after his family persuaded him to, he settled out of court with the family. <br>  Now, who in the right mind would accept money over justice? Just goes to show money was all they were after?<br>  <br>  The second one in 2005 - he was accused of it again and was taken to court and PROVED INNOCENT - most people seem to miss this part. Just because you've been accused doesnt make you guilty.<br>  The boy's mother was a con-woman who had done things like this many times before. She was clicking her fingers in the courtroom at the judge and then her son told the court that Michael hadnt harassed him in any way.

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	My little female German shepherd has a "Come hither" way about her that has bamboozled just about every guy she has ever met. She flirts with truck drivers (if they have a nice truck, but that's another story in itself), friends, family, and any guy that she thinks is an easy target. I've never been sure if it's more entertaining or embarassing to watch her play men for a sucker.<br>  <br>  The last time my husband's co-worker came to pick up some parts, Jamie decided to work her feminine wiles on him. He loves dogs to begin with, and he offered to take her outside for her afternoon potty break. When I take her out, she finds a spot quickly, does her thing, and comes right back in.<br>  <br>  I was doing some chores and not paying a lot of attention to the time. It finally dawned on me that "Uncle" Dwayne and Ms. Furry Femme Fatale had been outside for quite awhile -- like about half an hour's worth of quite awhile.<br>  <br>  Seems that she had suckered him into wandering around the yard for thirty minutes, looking for the perfect potty spot! "Oh, this looks like a good place. . .well, maybe not. Ah, maybe that one. . .nah, not quite right. How about over there?"<br>  <br>  The minute she saw Mom stick her head out the door, she decided that she'd found the perfect spot after all. I could hardly look Dwayne in the eye when he came back to the house. . .if for no other reason than that big neon "SUCKER" sign that had suddenly appeared on his forehead! :)|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Hahaaha no, I only have tropical fish.|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	Years ago I had a Springer Spaniel, Poppy  ..she was crazy ..  ..

I was walking down the sidewalk and some people were coming up behind me and to the side. They were talking about how cute he was so I kept walking. I hate to admit it but I was feeling all cool, people loved my dog when people usually stare or get afraid (I think he almost gave one lady a heart attack when she looked at him and he barked).  Anyways...so I was walking down the sidewalk when all of a sudden he stops. Just stops meanwhile I keep walking right into the him, stumble and just regain my balance in time to run away...which then ended up with him almost dragging me.<br>  <br>  Your story is not bad...cats are just I dunno, but glad it worked out for ya!!|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	yes all the time , I have a friend staying and the cat was sick  in her suitcase ....nice xxx|`|qWqg7vFJaa	Our dogs tend to fart a lot Andie..And it stinks too...phewwww|`|iA5kZv15aa	When I was still at home my mother had a load of guests round for tea and they were sitting in the living room commenting on the nice wallpaper and drinking tea.<br>  Cue Max, my German Shepherd, who dragged a pink cushion in the middle of the floor and started to romance it vigorously, if you know what I mean.<br>  I couldn't tell him off for laughing|`|v6tK8lhOaa	yeah...I was walking my dog and she started pooping in the middle of the street and I tried pulling her into the grass, but she was pooing as I was pulling her and there was a couple walking by and I started laughing cuz it was like......uhhhhhh|`|joT6bbSXaa	ha ha very funny story, but no, my cat hasn't embarrassed me in front of other people but he's very hilarious!!|`|pfR5t4zkaa	I have a female chihuahua..<br>  She humps her teddies constantly..<br>  seriously, like all day everyday...<br>  It's embarrassing when we have guests, although most are used to it!!|`|JOAPnhOgaa	aww nice story<br>  <br>  when i had a dog the only embarrassing thing that happened was cleaning up after her in the park when she had diarrhoea lol|`|Kg681jL8aa	at least that was good, i don't like little dogs much, they tend to be skittish, yapping, shaking uncontrollably, etc...|`|gVQ6es5Taa	My dog ran into the back of someones knees at top speed at knocked her clear off her feet, and he did it on purpose!!!

gIjnoEi5aa	After the completion of Hollywood week the judges chose 36 semi-finalists and divided them into 3 groups.  Group one performed on Tuesday and group 2 and 3 will perform in the upcoming two weeks.  The highest voted girl, guy, and the third highest voted contestant (regardless of gender), will make it to the top 12.  Then from what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12. So if your fave contestant has already gone home there's still a chance he or she can come back to the competition.

They dont deserve to be on the big screen OR be mucisions.  The only reason they are even known is because of Disney.  I really wish that I could go back in time and save Walt Disney from being kicked in the balls by bigfoot.  Thing is, Disney just picks random people off the street and puts them in a movie.  A few days later, those people become INSTANT pop stars.  And what Ive noticed is that all the songs sung by girls sound the same, and all the boy sung songs sound the same.  Sometimes, they talk really fast in the begining.  Dude, seriously, unless your the last guy talking in a commercial, you SHOULDNT be speaking that fast.

I have and am presently using some for yard ornaments. . . . good choice !|`|nGNJFyGXaa	My stupid garden nomes make surfboards out of them.  I live in freakin' Arizona for chissake!|`|tIGyEDEUaa	I like it, we brought my mom a huge piece years ago and it's still on her wall.|`|dl0EpJPDaa	It's great, especially if you use the right kind of plants.|`|0wBIlxdraa	I'm guessing that someone other than you mows your lawn.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	I like it, if you live near a beach or along the coast.|`|8nm2psyKaa	umm kinda cool if you live near the ocean or lake but if you live in the dessert just kinda weird. I think they would look cool ina flower garden or something in the back yard..idk tho I'm not a driftwoodologist...lol
RFn0AiSnaa	NO well i dont believe in the bible i think thats retarded and i do think there might me something or someone out there|`|pHteEAF8aa	My beliefs are my own and while I refer to what I believe in as a God, I doubt we have the same definition. <br>  <br>  <br>  My God is not found in a book, or a building.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I believe in a creator and a higher power. I have no respect for churches who act as collection agencies.|`|daij1eBCaa	Yes. There's nothing to tell. I just believe in him. ?|`|iisbgn17aa	My answer is: idk. I always say yes when people ask me, because I feel like thats just what I'm supposed to say lol. And I'll admit its very comforting to think of a wise grandfatherly person up in the sky watching over me always, but it seems a bit sketchy. My parents dont believe in God & sometimes I wish they were strict Catholics so that they made me believe in it too. They say theres no proof, the Bible isnt credible, etc. I hope there is a God... :)<br>  <br>  Love Sienna<3|`|bHphhSYbaa	No way.<br>  Science disproves religion. Besides, look around you. This world always has been, and always will be, overrun with pain and suffering (emotional and physical), poverty, hunger, war, violence, torture, abused kids, criminals and every other form of the ugly side of life.<br>  If he is supposed to return, wouldn't this be a perfect time considering how bad things have become in this world? We will never see him because he simply doesn't exist.|`|hecLfcedaa	NO. My mum was a christian and that did'nt turn out well for her. All these bible stories are pretty unbelievable. If Noah got all the animals onto his ark, how did they cross countries to get there? And don't tell me that the Lions didn't fancy the two mice on the way as a tasty snack. It's soooo unbelievable, if you think about it.|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	No, there's too much science to believe in god, and no one can show me proof, therefore, i dont believe.<br>  <br>  :)|`|89defcc97f06bb462c28a75ae2e1b729aa	Yes, because life is so complex that I think it couldn't of happened by chance. For example the fact that no two snowflakes are ever alike... that's always blown my mind.|`|8mchLCQhaa	Yes because I know he is real!|`|iYEWbE23aa	atheist, show me evidence!|`|tLVZXLRSaa	Nope. I don't have enough proof.|`|wytnGL0xaa	i dont believe in god because i just find it hard to believe, and theres not enough proof.|`|1UokhVRXaa	of course. Proof everywhere.|`|88uIjItaaa	Yes<br>  Born and Raised that Way. Will always believe in Him.

LRLu1ofNaa	I don't hate them... But I really dislike them. (and I am a girl)<br>  My reasons:<br>  They are extremely overrated, especially for a talentless boyband.<br>  They can not sing. They sound constipated when they try to.<br>  They can't play their own music, they need a backup band.<br>  They seem so cocky and annoying.<br>  Their fans really annoy me.<br>  <br>  Oh God, when will their dumb little fans realize we aren't jealous?|`|aZTrQKMwaa	Guys envy them because their girlfriends are into them and say weird things around them like "They're so hot" or "I love JOE!!!" and it kinda makes the boyfriends feel intimidated. And guys who don't have girlfriends at all are probably just envious of them because they get all the girls, the money, and fame.|`|IpFgrkJAaa	Jealousy :] haha|`|wseWiC4Gaa	cos they're gay and they suck cock.|`|eta0c25yaa	Eh... not my type of music.. Sorry. =/<br>  <br>  Their super obsessed fans are CRAZY.|`|KPac9A2qaa	Hmm I don't hate them but I don't particularly care for them because well mostly the hype. I admit Nick was a good singer when he was little but now he just whines in his songs, and Joe and Kevin can't sing. They also aren't that good looking. The main problem is that everyone thinks they are so awesome when there is really nothing that awesome about them...(opinion)|`|CUpFDEseaa	first off...all the girls out there (that have eyes and ears, at least.) hate them to. the reason guys hate them is because guys are often waaaay hotter then them and they don't understand how all the stupid, idiotic girls out there cud POSSIBLY think of the jonas sisters as hot and no them|`|4qwu50hjaa	It's because guys think they are taking all the girls|`|EycMZe4Uaa	I don't hate them. i like their style and im not gay!  people just have different taste in music.|`|hkBFRZu8aa	lmfao, i know. every guy at my school HATES them. i think its because they're madly jealous (:|`|Z1JOKoUBaa	well its that boys are not atracted to them|`|k39bNUgeaa	It's not just guys<br>  <br>  They are annoying<br>  They can't sing<br>  They play 3 chords on a guitar and they think they are the best<br>  There fans are annoying

gIjnoEi5aa	I guess the producers are trying to switch the format up to keep everyone their toes.  And it's working because people are talking.    So, after the completion of Hollywood week the judges chose 36 semi-finalists and divided them into 3 groups. Group one performed on Tuesday and group 2 and 3 will perform in the upcoming two weeks. The highest voted girl, guy, and the third highest voted contestant (regardless of gender), will make it to the top 12. Then from what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12. So if your fave contestant has already gone home there's still a chance he or she can come back to the competition.|`|daij1eBCaa	Wild card round. ?|`|eI5rgLcraa	they are just plain stupid i guess|`|PgE9ruBdaa	I honestly think it's stupid this year but we can't change anything.

They'll sing and then three will be passed on into the top 12. I wish they'd just done it normally. I'm not sure if<br>  This is entirely correct but I think it's<br>  Something like this.|`|svdZrJfbaa	there were 36 people chosen<br>  there are 12 groups of three<br>  3 people from each group goes on<br>  they have a wild card round<br>  i really don't know how someone gets chosen to be in it but that's when they will choose the final 3 to make the top 12|`|6efb881973246debd62243c5b0b3f7d6aa	Maybe this is where wild card comes in?

hgO4iGSvaa	well, it's actually not that difficult. Many people are hesitant about using online marketing tools and assume it's a scam. The spider-marketing system is actually legit and I did pick up 2,000 the last month. But to make good money takes a lot of time and effort.

That is truly retarded.|`|De8z6qH4aa	If the building was high enough and you jumped off, wouldn't you already be dead before they gave you the penalty? :P|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	seriously?!? LMAO  that's stupid!|`|AA10838250	Only in New York.   thank you|`|XQMm3Ahraa	thats stupid it's like they are helping you commit suiside if it's true because say you live then they kill you anyway it's like th law is commiting assisted suiside|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	cool why havent we put that into law in florida|`|OXleDYVQaa	Silly as it seems, Suicide is a crime on many law books.

AAgX0SDcaa	maybe but they might be boring, no body is perfect and it would take a lot of energy to even try to be. And if they think they are perfect then that is arrogance and that is a vice. and very annoying to be around someone who is arrogant|`|m3ThrbDMaa	No...<br>  <br>  Because even "religion" could be considered a "vice..."<br>  <br>  (Everybody needs something in their daily lives to maintain some happiness, whether it be donuts, cigs, beer, Hostess Ho Ho's, candy, pot, whatever...)|`|B812Gknnaa	hhhhhmmm....possible yes....likely? not so much.|`|8f81c557782db78a6e0cfb5ef1ca75a0aa	I would say very doubtful.|`|BMYOukx5aa	What vice would that be|`|BKacbxmiaa	I don't think so.

tDUs971eaa	They are entirely different.<br>  <br>  I have little of significant value to contribute to humanity,<br>  however I am an expert on the issue of stepping in dog poo.<br>  Here is a brief treatise on the subject:<br>  <br>  1) Poo happens. If you have a dog or are thinking about having<br>  a dog know this fact.<br>  2) Swearing offers temporary relief. I recommend "Oh 5hit !".<br>  It has worked for millions, it will work for you.<br>  3) Watch your step. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of poo.<br>  4) The remedy: You will need a stiff brush and a bucket of water.<br>  Remove the shoe. Wet the brush. Scrub the sole & heel of the shoe.<br>  If poo persists, use a straight bit screw driver to dig out the poo.<br>  Poo likes to get stuck in the deep treads of shoes & boots.<br>  Hold the shoe, sole down, and slap it down on the sidewalk.<br>  Be thorough in this process because poo loves carpet.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	It's harder, but perhaps slippery-er.|`|mQfkjlpMaa	Yes.

I've seen it happen many times, even when the man didn't have to pay any child support because the children were getting a check from the VA for support. I think they don't want to be needed but as soon as the kid is grown they want to reconnect and have a buddy and maybe they can get something from them then. who knows how that kinds of person thinks?|`|IWG4w5zAaa	By the sound of it, you're better off on your own.. I've managed on my own for many years and have never looked back.. <br>  <br>  It's sad that your kids will have to grow up without their dad,  but it doesn't sound as if they'd be missing much.. It does, however, afford you the opportunity to bring them up in your own way, thus avoiding the prospect of them growing up to be like him..!|`|9ADVLFOnaa	Having them involved isn't always the best option either, I'd like my ex to disappear, he's really getting on my t1ts!  <br>  <br>  If a man won't see his kids then he doesn't deserve them.|`|FIALhwlKaa	It′s a shame for him.

It's not really what I usually listen to (more Slipknotish than that) but I rather enjoyed it. I just downloaded it off of his myspace. :P<br>  <br>  However, the "Right Round" bit was, uh, 'borrowed' from a few bands (covers by, Orgy, Dope, New Order, Boy George, Depeche Mode (who, btw, it releasing a new album!), Billy Idol, and I believe Marilyn Manson (who's also releasing a new album.) The original artist was Dead or Alive, I believe.<br>  <br>  Hm, right now my five favourite songs would be:<br>  <br>  1. Right Round by Flo Rida and either Kesha Cole or Katy Perry (there is a good deal of debate on this, although his wikipedia page does say Kesha, but his myspace does not.)<br>  <br>  2. Happy bi Fischerspooner (a very happy song).<br>  <br>  3. Snuff by Slipknot.<br>  <br>  4. The Faded Line by Lamb of God<br>  <br>  5. Chelsea by the Summer Set (the full song is on their myspace for the next 24 hours. :P I immediately downloaded it.)<br>  <br>  Five favourite bands:<br>  <br>  1.

y7lUgd3aaa	Since Ive been a teenager I have always wanted 4 or 5 girls...no boys.  I just think that the clothing is so cute; when you have a boy you can't dress them up as you would a little girl.  I also think that girls are easier to raise if you can deal with the drama that is.  They are more willing to help around the house and aren't as loud.  It would also be fun to grow up with her and go shopping together.|`|bdf7cfde62fd88d2e83a2e808766cf0caa	I'm a girl, too but I can't help but find what you said about boys a littttttlllllleeeee sexist. XO. However I would also find it annoying if people got offended when I said I only wanted daughters. At the same time, I don't think a lot of men say they only want sons. I guess it depends on the parents and how they'd like to see the family they want to raise. In my opinion, I would hope I have fraternal twins the first time? lmao.|`|nsgeWjspaa	i have 3 kids 2 girls and a boy and boys are not any harder than girls as girls get older they are snobby and mouthy and think they are completely grown by the age of 10  they think they know everything but your son will always be protective of you and will respect you more than any one else in your life trust me with girls theres just as much to worry about as with boys its all about the way you raise them on what kind of respect they show you just remember your children are a reflection of you|`|KwHfQcf4aa	thats a hard questionn! idkk maybee a girl. they <br>  would probably be more open with stuff cuz im a<br>  girl too. but i would love to have a boy to play sports<br>  and stuff with him! i wish i could have one boy and one<br>  girll! hahaha probably a longer answer than expected...|`|pxTsBlOMaa	If I could only have one, I believe I would want a boy.  I know many girls/women that are just as bad as many boys/men.  If I could have more than one child I would want a boy first and girl second.|`|EZ7FK5e6aa	I want a girl personally, because I want a child that can come to me for things, and a boy is more likely to go to his dad|`|Z7zI7bROaa	I would want a daughter too.....or a son who didn't mind wearing dresses.

I could go on a rant about why girls are a pain to raise... but instead I will just answer your question. <br>  <br>  I personally would like one girl and one boy, but if I had to pick only one, I suppose I would rather have a son. <br>  <br>  Though you did ask, " I mean what's the worse a daughter can become if you don't raise her right?" <br>  <br>  Oh trust me, men arent the worst things on the planet. What happens if your daughter grows up to be a complete slut? I suppose you wouldnt have a problem with that. Drug addict? Theif? Complete *****? Girls are not perfect.

Of course most of the movies on Blu-ray I have already seen (or own on regular DVD) but I am glad to see The Criterion is converting their collection to Blu-Ray as well.. I already picked up Chungking Express, The Third Man, and cannot wait for The 400 Blows to be released as well (unfortunately they are doing few releases at a time)<br>  <br>  Most movies I watch (classics and foreign) are not on Blu-Ray yet.. But the new movies that are just coming out and being released on Blu-Ray- No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, look amazing..<br>  It's not only better picture quality.. They also include a lot more special features as there is a ton more memory on a Blu-Ray disc than standard DVD. This is a nice feature if you like commentary, director interviews, etc. With some brand new Blu-Rays (apparently Wanted- even though the movie is crap) there is enough room to allow you to view the film in different in different camera angles- which is insane.|`|H0knYRKbaa	If you're an avid movie watcher and have the extra money then it is definately worth it. The picture quality is amazing. We got ours for free with our TV. However, if you dont have a lot of free money then id probably spend my money on other things.

M62ZtzNqaa	if she can't buy a washing machine then she damn well can't support me|`|OXleDYVQaa	Sure they could be. I might suspect something though if they wanted to borrow change, detergent, and asked how to do the laundry.<br>  <br>  It does seem like an unlikely place to pick up people, but one never knows?<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|3SWe11Knaa	It depends on if they know how to use the Genital Cycle...|`|13hDE66Oaa	It depends on what's in their laundry.

ykSzku8Uaa	Check feedback always<br>  Some people sell copys of phones and xboxes etc to trick you.<br>  Its most probably cheap as it will appeal to alot of people and get alot of bids, it will probably go for a much higher price than it is now.<br>  Bid at the last minute if you want it at the highest price you'd go, thats the best way!|`|yw3Jze2naa	nah.<br>  considering its probably used, the person can't price it  for much higher.|`|2BLfykCUaa	Nah, someone wants to sell it =]|`|4XaL68C4aa	Why, does it look like a scam?<br>  <br>  Look at the seller's feedback rating.

d23F89ECaa	Sounds like a good plan, but I'll bet one thing leads to another.<br>  <br>  Meaning, if you are approved for this program, you're credit rating will be effected until you're grandchildren are dead and you're house insurance will go through the roof.<br>  <br>  Remember, nothing is free, especially when it comes to the government.<br>  <br>  Lets keep in mind, this is to keep the banks above water, not you and me.  If you receive help to pay off your mortgage, the banks won't have as many bad loans and won't be losing as much money.  Meaning, the national banks and economy driven by them will be stronger.<br>  <br>  Don't think for a second this is to help out the average American.|`|AA11609300	It doesn't work like that.

I didn't even watch last night. It's been boring me. Maybe the novelty has just worn off after 8 years? I don't know. I'm not too excited. I think it's partly due to the new judge. <br>  <br>  <----don't like her and I think they are slowing fading Paula out of the show.|`|qTHkBmH6aa	i strongly disagree.<br>  <br>  αм?яι￠αи ?α? я υ?? ツ|`|RIZpDdNgaa	i think american idol sucks every year, it puts me to sleep.|`|RbiJ2vtHaa	What! <br>  Blasphemous!!<br>  Curses on you!!<br>  <br>  ~Shae|`|cD98VDaSaa	Yes. it was on tv a min ago, not sure if it still is<br>  <br>  x factor is better, ive never liked american idol|`|XNJK09ZDaa	Yeah!

There have been a lot of murders having to do with random violent acts of the mentally ill. And when you hear mentally ill, you think of a crazy person. Though I do agree with you, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Society has just put a name on them.|`|Z7zI7bROaa	Some of them ARE criminals and have done quite a bit wrong.

48RC7Vsgaa	The old abandoned tuberculosis hospital in PG county, not far from here.<br>  Glen Dale hospital.<br>  <br>  There are stories about that place. People have broken in on Halloween, seen things in the dark of the night, felt erie chills all around them. Police fired rounds at unseen creatures, an estranged security guard with an abnormal bite on his hand lead a couple of boys inside and disappeared.<br>  The hospital was built while tuberculosis was on the rise. Treatments at the hospital rarely worked and it had to be shut down. The old rusted equipment was left behind in the evacuation.<br>  There are rumors that it was later used as a mental hospital, but there's not much proof of that, however, because of the frequent break-ins, it is possible that partially insane homeless roam the old, rotting halls.<br>  Personally, I think it's beautiful.<br>  <a href="http://www.opacity.us/site32_glenn_dale_hospital.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.opacity.us/site32_glenn_dale_...</a>|`|n5u3rkV4aa	We were hikin and it looked like a haunted house.

jV99kgWbaa	We had the cane too, but I was a goodie-goodie so never go it :)<br>  <br>  I did come close once though.  The playground supervisor was going to take me to the head mistress for allegedly "looking at the boys" going into the canteen. (I went to an all-girls' school, but the boys' section shared the canteen -- at different times from us of course.)<br>  <br>  However, the playground supervisor relented. After all, I wasn't guilty!  I was looking at them, yes, but only for psychological study purposes :o)<br>  <br>  The only time I actually got corporal punishment was when I was 11. I was slapped with a ruler for measuring a line the wrong size. In my opinion, this was also a misunderstanding as I had told the girl beside me we weren't to go by the no of squares in the book, but should measure it ourselves. Unfortunately I went along with her method in the end.<br>  <br>  It was a great lesson that has stood me in good stead throughout life.  Never measure a line the wrong size just because someone tells you to.|`|7hrOjPwjaa	We had the strap.

Or if we're nodding off at the back he walks along the row and gives us all a slap on the back of the head. He does it all in a playful way though, he's never actually hurt us. Though when I was in Year 8 an art teacher was fired for throwing a stool at one of the kids. (He was having a mental breakdown it turns out.)|`|8uIfskigaa	In primary school Nuns they were wicked..once we were told to get off the grass so were walking off & they said you didn't get off so we were brought in a few of us & got many slaps on our hands with this massive thick ruler, was like a plank of wood I tell you......many times in class also if you made a mess with your ink pen...I remember pulling my hand back as so afraid & then got extra.....they also pulled the ears off my sister but they didn't again after my mother paid them a visit........But my brothers got awful beatings from the Christian Brothers & humiliated in front of their friends....slaps across the head etc.....must have been banned sometime after........nasty feckers the lot of them :)|`|jdpBGzU3aa	Yes we had the cane or the strap..........ouch..........!!

Sometimes, Broadway can have another connotation. But, if you're not loaded, the most you can be is 'cultured'. Good luck, though. If you can fake it long enough, you might find some rich, old codger that wants you as a trophy wife. Then you'll be in.

kPMxo2MCaa	Definitely Taken, that's a no-brainer. The Uninvited isn't scary at all, and Fired Up is a Superbad wannabe.

The other two are more serious and you have to pay attention.  I think when you go with friends you should go see a movie that will make you laugh.

Also I love Victoria Justice and she did such a good job in the movie<br>  Dadnapped looked okay, but most people who saw it said that it was a disappointment or that it was really lame.

In fact, he is loving and gracious, and he believes in you. That said, I have to tell you that at some point, you will have to make the decision of whether or not you believe in Him, as everyone else does. But don't be anxious about it, God is patient and understanding.|`|pIc6TiYIaa	as i have said before.....<br>  <br>  your question is equivilent to:<br>  <br>  if you don't belive in unicorns will unicorns still believe in you?<br>  <br>  <br>  the rest i believe you can figure out yourself.|`|08K5zuGIaa	Yes.

She is getting another divorce.  <br>  <br>  Do your parents usually give good advice?  If they do, please listen to them.  If they do not, you can decide.  But parents are normally very good.

m4PtEEDNaa	...although the first one will always be heralded as the most classic entry in the series, I really have to admit a candid allure and attraction to the follow-up, "Friday the 13th Part II"; the film assumes a much more seemingly cruel and sadistic atmosphere & attitude, than any of the other "F13" entries.  The hockey mask, introduced in "Part III" obviously made Jason a most recognizable modern-day horror icon, but the 'potato sack' masked Jason in "Part II" seemed much more monstrous and menacing...<br>  <br>  ...back to the comment of 'cruel and sadistic atmosphere & attitude', "Part II" definitely assumes a distinct, and equally cruel & sadistic inspiration to a chilling and oh-so graphic 1971 Italian giallo, directed by the great Euro-filmmaker, Mario Bava, and called "Twitch of the Death Nerve".  In fact, "F13 Part II" even emulates many of the same gruesome and bloody deaths, as depicted in it's Euro-based predecessor...|`|XCVFEAC8aa	No, I think 3 is!, cause it's when Jason first gets the hockey mask!|`|aX00eUSKaa	yes and the new one is really good too.|`|qLb81FkPaa	That one is good but I love Freddy VS Jason if you are counting that one.
IqoRBVUTaa	Well......I'd go back to my precious California and do some more surfing, then I'd do some'ore skate boarding, then I'd play some football, Then I'd would go swimming in that fountain that I was told never to touch, Then I'd climb the CN tower and sky dive off, then I'd  kiss my bf goodbye and commit suicide with the gun I had stole from a guy that was twice my size on that motorcycle with that gang.

And when you love someone, when youre mad at them, as much as you seem to hate them, you cant stop loving them (at least, true love) and hate, when you talk trash about someone, or to someone, you always feel that hit to the stomach because you dont want to hurt them. because you care about them. caring is a form of love.|`|jLhg1IJXaa	well, i really don't hate anyone. and I was recently told my love wasn't worth much.

zNPGaZRHaa	Yes I do. Everytime a very big battle comes around (vs Kenpachi, vs Byakuya, vs Grimmjaw) Ichigo gains a large amount of power. I suspect that since this fight vs Ulquiorra has been drummed up so much, Ichigo will get a monster power boost. Cant wait to see it.|`|hSpsroCXaa	I think that Ichigo hasn't fully mastered his Bankai, i think there is more too it and it will come out when he's fighting Ulquiorra.<br>  <br>  I also think that there will be more to his Hollow form, maybe he can change more of his body into a hollow or even get more abilities from it.<br>  Well considering Chad's powers are compared to that of a hollow, maybe Ichigo will be able to change his arms and/or legs into a Hollow.<br>  <br>  Ichigo will more than likley receive a power boost in every single tough fight he is in.<br>  <br>  Well considering the struggle he had with Grimmjow, if he was still at that level he wouldn't have been able to keep up with ulquorra in his unreleased form.|`|l6NpeG3Oaa	Good question.  So, What I want to think is that Ichigo will be knocked out by Ulquiorra.  Then, as Ulquiorra uses another attack to finish off Ichigo, hollow Ichigo comes out and fight Ulquiorra.  He may even beat Ulquiorra.  I think hollow Ichigo is really powerful seeing he has more techniques when he fought Ichigo -- like when he held the cloth of the sword and spin the sword like a whip.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Good question<br>  <br>  There's no doubt that Ichigo will get a full power boost as you stated. Until Ichigo can stay alive until the next time that Hichigo is around, Hichigo won't give him the power boost that Ichigo needs.<br>  <br>  At his current state, Ichigo's around mid-power level.

AgQForcYaa	Judas Priest coined the heavy metal image. And Motorhead, I've always seen as more of a hard rock band than heavy metal. Iron Maiden still kicks @$$, and there is nothing quite like them.|`|dFacbjIZaa	It would be very hard to say which had more of an impact, I hear a ton of Maiden and Priest both in modern Power metal, and the screaming dissonance of Motorhead I hear in other genres, I don't think You can overstress the legacy of any of the three.|`|6P8vAT38aa	70's Judas Priest had the biggest impact.<br>  <br>  Although 80's Motorhead had a massive influence as well.|`|6jNBKvQGaa	All three, I think, were equally important.  I'm going to say Judas Priest, simply because they formed 6 years before the other two groups.|`|qPNLkZfVaa	Did I tell you that my name is legally, Lemma Kilmisses? It's true.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Judas Priest, they brought the leather into the metal world. Then Maiden then Motorhead, with all due respect to each one|`|Ot06v8yvaa	I would say  Led Zeppelin<br>  <br>  had a more impact than any other band.<br>  <br>  <br>  But for your question I say Iron Maiden !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IPa0VD0zaa	i would have to go with iron maiden|`|pyXn05dHaa	Iron maiden of course!<br>  <br>  80 million sold...or more.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	All 3 had huge impact, but I would say that Maiden has had the more ENDURING impact.<br>  <br>  Many of the bands from the 80s site all 3 as influences, but when you start looking at the bands from the 90s til now, you still see a lot of references to Maiden, but few if any to Priest (except for some Power Metal bands) or Motorhead (by pretty much anyone).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, from plain jane Alt Rock to crappy Mall Metal to Metal Core to Heavy Metal and NuMetal, you see constant talk of Iron Maiden (and Metallica)<br>  <br>  So, I would say that Maiden has had the more lasting direct legacy to the world of modern Metal.  Though I do think that even indirectly, all 3 still have a lot of influence, and mostly garner respect (at least among the bands, if not always the small minded peabrains that seem to populate so much of the Metal fanbase these days.)<br>  <br>  *hmmm... a TD just for answering?  Interesting.  Free world I suppose, but seems like a silly answer to TD.  =\|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Tough call. I'd say Iron Maiden overall.|`|UDqQNYglaa	For me, Iron Maiden.<br>  Just about every Melodic Death Metal band can list Maiden has an influence. There are so many bands now that have that really melodic, fast-paced sound, and I think Iron Maiden kinda coined that certain sound. For example, early Children of Bodom is an obvious case where Maiden influenced the way a band writes songs and sounds. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sweeeeet avatar, btw. I've always said ATG's rocket logo was the best logo in metal...|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Maiden for sure<br>  <br>  although I agree that Motorhead and Judas Priest both had huge impact. I think Black Sabbath is another one that had a huge impact.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Iron Maiden for me...<br>  <br>  <br>  Lmao to the girl above me wtf|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	maiden in music<br>  priest in style and clothing...

In this state when a parent is seen as unfit and continues to have babies. DHS will take custody at birth. So I think that should happen... if she has more the state (or an adoption agency) should step in and immediately place them with adoptive families. <br>  I am as disgusted as everyone is about this mothers piss poor decisions but no one should have the right to make medical decisions about anyone elses own body. These people making these harsh comments like that her uterus should be fed to starving babies.... THEY are just as if not more crazy. Can you imagine it? eating a uterus? ugh!!!!!!<br>  Before they make a move to sterilize her, they should get her the mental health help she so desperately needs. And then maybe she would finally come to that conclusion on her own.<br>  <br>  *edit* best case senario for these children (not mom): I am assuming that many of these babies are going to be high needs due to developmental issues that generally occure with premies. And therefore Social Services is going to be responsible for the majority of her children. If social services creates a home for them, with all the child care supports and therapies they will be needing. And get Mom the mental health care she needs. While keeping all the children together. Many people are not taking into account the relationships between siblings as important as they are. Even if these kids can not be raised by her they need to stay together as much as possible. And if the state is gonna take custody they may as well set up one large group home for the whole lot of them. IMHO|`|IizPFrELaa	Sterilizing her will not keep her from getting pregnant, as she would still be able to do IVF and get pregnant.<br>  <br>  She "technically" is sterilized and the only way to carry to term is to use IVF.<br>  <br>  In theory it would be nice but not gonna happen, what she really needs is a hysterectomy to remove her uterus|`|TJHxVwrpaa	Yes someone with that many damn kids (14) who can't afford to take care of them deserves to be sterilized. That's why the world is overpopulated now, because of people like her who want to keep om having kids and can't afford it and expect my tax dollars to help out people like her. Oh hell no.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I read that her house was in forclosure. Cha Ching. She will be getting $30K from Obama. That woman should be put in a mental hospital, or at least get some therapy. Did you see her interview with Anne Curry? (I'm so glad she didn't get paid for that interview! She should not be rewarded for what she is doing!) She's really strange. Thinks she's justified. Doesn't think that medicaid, disability payments, or food stamps are "welfare". LOL. She was absolutely nuts. I feel so bad for all those kids.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Yessssss!!!!!!!!!!|`|NOKKtjaGaa	yes|`|zu0W6hCTaa	i wish she would get lepracy|`|BhQSTvLsaa	I think she needs to get attacked by a chimp.|`|AA11016425	At least!|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Yes!|`|G9FiXGvmaa	Yes, right after she's slapped.|`|edd92ad764d0c8774472bd25d0b6aa88aa	Without a doubt, but the Doctor who administered the invitro should be fined for gross negligence.|`|WigKJFOiaa	yes,and her doctor should lose his license|`|KWaTuVpqaa	I agree with Poker Face|`|x2rmsjIXaa	yes, and her uterus should be removed and fed to starving children.|`|CApnEZ83aa	No, With 8 at once and 6 more at home, she won't have time to do anything else but take care of the kids.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Her doctor at the pregnancy clinic should be shot.|`|eVsbtvi9aa	She should be caged like an animal.|`|zFQi5U5Naa	She should have her tubes tied and be put in a mental hospital|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Hell YES! And slapped around a little too! That kind of crap irritates me!|`|auFkrMD9aa	Offing her is a little drastic.  I'd flip her upside down and have fun with a bag of dry cement :)|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	She should have been spayed about 12 kids ago.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Yes, and her kids should be taken from her.|`|oquXwVCpaa	No, it is her body to do with as she wants. On the other hand, just because she had money to get pregnant with those babies, doesn't mean that she has enough money to raise them. Therefore I think that she should have thought this thru a little more carefully before she decided to get 6 more embryo's implanted.|`|BEKU3RPRaa	well as my understanding she said she can't have any more , she used up all of her eggs. so you have your answer, and for the people that are saying nasty things about this women, as you point your finger at her five more are pointing at you. we all make bad choices.|`|uRKDsMR3aa	Heck YEAH!!!   I am so mad that she did what she did, and u don't even know how many ppl out there aspire to be like her.. My bf's baby-momma is one of them. 5 kids with 4 different dude (except this hootchie didn't use "artificial insemmination")... And this ho is living "high on the hog"!!!  I hate women that scam the government by being baby ovens to get all their material needs for free out of life!|`|kgFayakraa	SHE SHOULD SELL SOME TO MICHAEL JACKSON|`|H2qEN27daa	I agree with Pokerface's answer first of all, but if we couldnt kill her then def sterilize her and give all her children to families that want to adopt. Now this b*tch is looking to buy a 1.2 million dollar home, give me an f'n break, with whose money ??!?!?!?!?|`|pYVRcoPsaa	Absolutely and the doctor who keeps giving her the invitro should pay all her bills and whatnot so that it doesn't fall back on innocent citizens who work everyday to support themselves and their family.|`|2SEVDjpnaa	Bitche should've gotten her tubes tied after the first six kids. I heard she's made quite a lot of money from interviews, so at least she should be able to support herself for awhile.|`|8bplNvAQaa	No, I think nuclear weapons should be banned.  But that won't happen.|`|dZ4N7hIEaa	maybe just have the horny button turned off. =)|`|JqswIk32aa	YES cause now she has like 14 kids and likes it that is just wrong|`|Sh13k42qaa	She should be working on the street|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	I think she should just be shot

1IWEKwznaa	You ain't gonna have any luck on Youtube. You have three options.<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net</a> <-- This is where I saw it. (Damn! Above answer beat me to the punch =( )<br>  2. If you are a little more daring, you can try BitTorrent. Use at your own risk, though... I got a Cease and Desist order from Paramount Pictures for piracy once.<br>  3. Message me and log onto YIM. If you can leave your computer on and IM window open overnight, I can transfer the file to you because I have it saved on my computer.<br>  <br>  If none of these work, u got a month and 4 days till the DVD is released.<br>  <br>  And, just gonna go ahead and say, Bolt is a WONDERFUL movie =D If you love dogs, you will love it!<br>  <br>  Peace out and good luck =D|`|9gOHTGB2aa	<a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies/bolt/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies...</a><br>  <br>  There are two clips that work.<br>  <br>  enjoy|`|ka6IPCTBaa	movie6.net<br>  <a href="http://movie6.net/?p=100" rel="nofollow">http://movie6.net/?p=100</a><br>  quality is pretty good|`|XbhDyCsBaa	Maybe try hulu.com.

hVKqKjrjaa	Yes I often do a google search and I do find the results enlightening,but asking other people can be interesting and add the human touch instead of a 'text book/clinical' type of answer.|`|8IzeMTmLaa	Yes, I use Google. If that fails to find me the answer to my question, I ask it on Yahoo! Answers.  If that fails to find me the answer, I say "f--k it" and go eat some nachos.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Yes.  I do it all the time when I don't know what something is or want to give a good answer.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	yeah. i check things out for myself. if google doesn't help, then i ask. some people on here ask things that i can find for them just by googling their question. LOL|`|YJlCKreSaa	Yeah, I use google.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	Yeah but don't get abused.  Where's the fun in that?|`|af565335de3c827b045055757b2c07efaa	The personal touch to an answer  goes alot farther than research  and searching on your own.

VvTY8dHNaa	Ah, at least your in groups of 5.<br>  Maybe sing background, add in a rap insert somewhere (rap is pretty much the easiest way for someone who can't sing to make music) or, if everyone in your group is up for it and/or a crappy singer, make up a dance routine to go with your song. If the dance goes well, it'll distract from the singing, and people will love it; if it doesn't, you'll be laughing, your singing will interrupted (most likely you'll be laughing anyway) and everyone will love it.<br>  Hope that helps. =)|`|uhchod38aa	Warn them that you can't sing.

Google Eden Sessions ^.^    They don't say who's playing yet, but you can reserve tickets for the gigs, then they will send you an email to say who's playing when they know. :]  I've booked tickets already.    Just to give you an idea, I recon Florence & the Machine will be there. I mean I can't be right, but Eden often have new bands, and Florence has been pretty big.    I can also think of Bestival, which is in the Isle of Wight. It's kind of like Glastonbury, but I think it only lasts 2 days.

BJIo6twUaa	The people who make the trailer do not know what scenes will be used in the movie. It happens  a lot where you see stuff in trailers that isnt in the movie. They just send a lot of clips to the people making the trailer but it does not mean those clips get used in the movie, for some reason the director or someone cut it from the movie. Probably see it as a deleted scene on dvd or something.
h67jWVbraa	That Chris Brown should  be put on jail,and there inside may the inmates beat him also so he will know what he did or more than that...my goshh,,beating a woman is no excuse! there's  no need of an investagation here..|`|eZtMqJSYaa	wow thats bad. but how are you sure its her? i dont think she would be putting that picture out there. but it might be. i think the whole situation is horrible. i like the both of them and i do think that Chris Brown should be punished for what i did. but from what i heard she hit him too and if thats true then she should be punished too. I am a woman and i think it is wrong when a male beats a female or anybody. and i think the same for when a woman beats her husband or boyfriend or child or anyone, which does happen probally more than people think. i think that people should be punished for their actions.|`|27sSI5wxaa	I won't be buying another Chris Brown CD.<br>  <br>  He needs to be put under the jail house and the key needs to be thrown away.<br>  <br>  We all make mistakes, but now he's trying to make excuses for his actions.<br>  <br>  That's unacceptable to me.|`|hmsCFQocaa	Don't think the investigation is done on this incident.

i1IE4Yztaa	The only one I recognize among those is Fruits Basket (LOOOVE it, by the way, especially the manga!)  First anime I ever saw, first manga I ever read.  :)  So since I don't recognize the others, are you mainly into shoujo?  <br>  <br>  Monster by Naoki Urasawa is the only manga that rivals my affection for Fruits Basket (I'm not a huge manga/anime fan, to be honest).  It's definitely NOT shoujo, but it's a wonderful, moving, deeply complicated psychological suspense story with some of the best characterization I've seen.  A bonus (in my opinion) is that the art is not stereotypical of manga.  The people really look like PEOPLE.  I recommend the manga highly, though the anime is very faithful and is one of the better ones I've seen.<br>  <br>  Another more well-known one is Death-Note.  It has supernatural elements, unlike Monster.  I loved the anime when I watched it, though I found the manga a little dry when I borrowed it from a friend.  There are also two excellent Japanese films now out on DVD in the US.  Again, it's not shoujo, but it's very absorbing.  <br>  <br>  Hana-Kimi is a shoujo I've been reading recently about a girl who disguises herself as a boy and attends an all-boys school to get closer to her crush.  I'm enjoying it, since it's often cute and funny.  It's VERY fluffy, though, not at all like Fruits Basket, which grew very dark and dramatic and more complex as it continued.  But, like I said, it's still cute.  <br>  <br>  Hope you find something great to read/watch!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Shoujo is basically a manga/anime aimed at young girls.  Fruits Basket would fit in this category.  Shounen is the opposite, a manga/anime aimed at young boys, something like Naruto (I guess) or Death Note.  Although in my opinion, shoujo IS more girly, while a lot of shounen would appeal to either gender, not only boys.|`|lOR8QDBpaa	love hina anime/manga read manga first<br>  elfen lied anime|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	"Deathnote" pretty good...also watch this movie called "Grave of the Fireflies" the link is down below....awesome.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies/grave_of_the_fireflies/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies...</a><br>  <br>  *Note-  Watch version #1 on the site of "Grave of the Fireflies"...you'll get a direct link to Veoh.com where they have anime movies and series to watch online....but you need to download their "Veoh Software" and register...thats all...enjoy....|`|IGu36Iwwaa	Well since you only really got a half answer to your shonen/shoujo question I'll take that one up.  The shonen/shoujo is usually only in reference to romance manga/anime.  Shonen is used when the main character is a boy and shoujo when the main character is a girl.  The prefix Bi- is added when referring to "cute" anime or manga, in these the main character is highly stylized to be extra cute or pretty.  And the suffix -ai is used to refer to gay anime/manga, Shonen-ai is most prevalent in the US (Gravitation) though shoujo-ai can be found (Strawberry Panic).|`|OPRqtHgeaa	Shonen in japanese litteraly means boy. But when you refer to anime it means boy type anime/manga (anime/manga that boys like) e.g Naruto and Yu Gi Oh<br>  Shoujo is girl, types of girl anime/manga are Vampire Knight and Hana Kimi.<br>  <br>  I think you may like vampire knight or Ouran High School host club. <br>  Theres also Tsubasa, The Melochany of Haruhi Suzumiya and Shakugan no Shana.|`|5uYsApYbaa	HIGHLY recommend CODE Geass: lelouch of the rebillion.<br>  <br>  also<br>  D.n angle -anime<br>  death note-anime/manga<br>  x tv-anime<br>  love.love (R18)-anime/manga<br>  sailor moon-anime<br>  papa kiss in the dark-anime <br>  vampire knight-anime/manga<br>  vampire knight guiltyanime<br>  narutoanime/manga<br>  naruto shippuden-anime<br>  black cat-anime<br>  blood +-anime<br>  chrono crusade-anime<br>  fate/stay night-anime<br>  gundam seed-anime<br>  darker than black-anime<br>  my hime-anime<br>  love hina-anime<br>  monster-anime<br>  tactics-anime<br>  descendents of darkness-anime<br>  hell singanime/manga<br>  zombie loan-anime<br>  skip beat-anime/manga<br>  kitchen princess-manga<br>  the one -manga<br>  S.P.Y -manga<br>  lovenista-manga<br>  desire climax-manga (R18)<br>  <br>  <br>  also visit this site<br>  <a href="http://www.animetoplist.org/watch/anime-list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.animetoplist.org/watch/anime-...</a><br>  this should supply all the websites you could watch the anime and the anime itself!!<br>  it has heapzzzzz<br>  <br>  and this site for manga <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  <br>  >.<|`|AA11005280	Honey & Clover - it's really good|`|MzZwQS3zaa	ARCHIE COMICS ITS SO COOL AND THERE ARE MORE THAN 1000000000000 SERIES<br>  JUST START FROM 1 BUY IT OR READ IT ONLINE FIND IT IN GOOGLE|`|EgNgEVaRaa	lol i've never seen any of those<br>  try code geass it's a great show

2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	<<< comes up behind spaz with black cloth bag. puts said bag over her head and tells her to be quiet. then walks spaz out to the van where the others are waiting. puts spaz in van and tells driver to GO!! then, with help from aformentiond friends, trains spaz to say 'goodbye' and 'i'll get that to you as soon as it's ready, bye' then releases spaz back at her work to continue her day. lmao|`|tg4K6bIYaa	i say 'later'|`|xxEYYSl9aa	be carefull!|`|BcjFssaEaa	ooohhh my fella laughs at me all the time,   i say "ok, tara tara bye bye" all the time no matter who its is. my goodbye lasts longer than most average conversations lol  xxxxx|`|GjXD0H2iaa	The last word I usually say is "...OFF"|`|6k8GJBRPaa	It is also the voice how you say "bye". You can say "mmmm, bye (like you're saying "mmm, this is really disgusting food") or you can say "bye" very happy.  Myself, I don't have a really spectacular ending, but I'm always trying to finish in a positive way. And I'm positive, as I've reached level 4!!|`|e4cce4fb6115df97b6140e853aeb9fcdaa	I say talk to you or see you later. I never say good-bye unless I never plan on seeing you again.|`|NVAOTIRDaa	I usually go night-night or bye luv (no matter the person)|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	just end with " hey " then hang up  '|`|dShUF6A9aa	Bye.|`|bBHlGs5waa	I usually say peace or good night.|`|hIrBZS3oaa	"Love you. Bye." To family members.  I've slipped up and since it's a habit, i've said, "I love you. Bye." to telemarketers :-)|`|6of3tqHhaa	I usually say Bye
lgUU1t0aaa	i agree but when i get best answer it makes me happy (hint hint lol)|`|lza4rhDqaa	No, it doesn't. The only thing that bothers me is, like in my instance, someone was following all my answers and getting everyone of them removed for a while there, even though there was nothing offensive about them. One just said "Haha, funny", and it was removed and the appeal amounted to nothing. Funny thing is that anyone I have ever reported abuse on still have their answers up when they are using foul language and everything else.|`|tJA5cbqfaa	yes for me it does but then agan its not that bad cuz at least i kno i can always get em back by answering 10 questions how bout it? ;)|`|RHs6m2dmaa	i would say yes. it is important to keep fit so all your organs work properly <br>   special your heart liver and pancreas.|`|DT2mU1jOaa	Only if I were not in violation and some twat reported me due to his twisted idea of fun.<br>  <br>  Keeping mute? No.|`|vz1pacbpaa	Losing 10 points did bother me but I am so use to it now. There are worse things! Many many!|`|eUlMn16gaa	Yeah... it does! I hate losing any thing except weight and loser guys!|`|dajfpt7iaa	Yes it would really bother me now if i dont get them|`|08afM6NEaa	yes, it does..|`|kGCd8ioRaa	yes, violations suck|`|AA11082713	It doesn't bother me at all...xxx|`|HRQjffv8aa	Yep.. but id rather lose 10points than not asking questions or answering at all|`|Gh2jzOHYaa	why would you loose ten points?|`|Vh9P5P60aa	no<br>  <br>  agree|`|NyBKQx2Aaa	Its not the ten points, its the losing of the entire account with +10,000 answers and +300 of my own special questions *sigh*|`|YWQdsoOMaa	I will just answer five more questions.  and all of a sudden I have those 10 points back.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	It does sometimes. Then I'm like ugggg now I have to go answer 5 more questions!|`|VzzQP2PJaa	Only if my answer was really good, and had a lot of effort put into it.|`|Qih2hKqkaa	No, but it tend to be habit forming!|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Yeah, kind of...I want to go up a level|`|NQuPNHPyaa	No.|`|vpmRRamKaa	ugh, nah|`|TKNQWdVwaa	nope. i just come here to get my questions answered. i don't care about some level.<br>  the only thing is i can't ask more than 5 questions in one day.|`|2SEVDjpnaa	I hate getting questions/answers deleted because some whiny bitche (this could be either a man or woman) got some sand in their Vajay because I offended their delicate sensitivities.|`|OpVysSzQaa	no it doesn't bother me, what bothers me is how I lost the points and the people I sometimes have to deal with on here.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Sometimes it does|`|RBDScB7Daa	Sometimes|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	i...lost.....10 points.......WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!...

That is what happened to me when I got my other account suspended over one stupid Q&A!!!  Gawd... I worked SO HARD TO GET THERE!!!|`|Oejricveaa	No, it doesn't really bother me.|`|eX0ZE30Naa	yeah.. when its collectively lost|`|15nnW3aLaa	HUUM, WELL MAYBE. SiNCE i DONT WANT TO ASK ANY QUESTiONS AND THiNGS.|`|ZyACe4kcaa	Uhm  no not really|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well as long as they can't take my birthday away I guess I'll be good|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	no|`|QCVzUC1baa	no|`|piwBGZqHaa	yes
QEEweJUaaa	My cat called tigs is my best pet ever.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Sugar Glider    It was cool because it was my little flying squirrel buddy - if you get them when they are very young they will become very tame and friendly.    But if you get them after they are grown and haven't been handled much, they will scare the **** out of you by "barking" and leaping at your face.|`|E3yOmel9aa	cat, not too needy|`|AA10998195	my present dog - she is so much company, a good watch dog and is very comforting to be here.  It's just me and her now|`|7R7e6yX5aa	no favorites in my house-we are all pains in the a$$|`|frwlypDWaa	The turtle tasted the best...|`|AA12349214	Crikey - each dog I have is the favourite at that time and when I look back I count myself lucky to have had the handful of characters that have lived their lives out with us and given us so much fun and laughter and love - unconditionally.  So sitting here now I cant pick and choose amongst them - but my life has been so enriched by having them all.|`|yM7YPmzSaa	Harry the Hamster    he was my first so has a place in my heart.    I still miss him :-(|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	Chihuahua.|`|AA10723657	my cat mark r. i .p 1995-2005 i miss him every day.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	My chihuahua that died last summer was my favorite. Her mother pushed her away at 4 weeks and I took her in and raised her from that point. She was 2 months shy of her 12th birthday when she died and she had been my sidekick her entire life. She was way more loyal than most humans I know......|`|IHa6FxE6aa	My dog.|`|C6NPYQ3Daa	i had a guinea pig called Muffy when i was 12,i loved that wee fella to bits,he loved his grub and i'd spoil him with apple and carrot,he was really social and would fall asleep if i held him for long enough and rubbed behind his ears.    R.I.P MUFFY|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Chipmunks...  Stella and Artois.|`|7SJ3cY48aa	My favourite Guinea pig was my own, Pebbles. But sadly he died last august. He was a tortoiseshell guinea pig with gorgeous colours. In a morning he would put his two front feet on the bars pf the cage and stretch because he wanted to go outside so much, and he would squeak too. He was so sweet x|`|4SGBr8cWaa	the cats i have now, they're alive|`|hIrBZS3oaa	That's like asking what child is your favorite!    They are all the best and I love them all equally :)|`|gIitANOkaa	I had only 1 cat in my lifetime|`|hJjuTC5Yaa	My Dogs , Frisky & Stinky.|`|dmcpdZKlaa	my stafordshire bullterrior.... hes just gorgeous!!!!!|`|v011fxgraa	my favorite cat i have has so far is a parrot.   The parrot was green with yellow spots. It was 2 years old when it died. :(|`|xRFLXYDzaa	My dog Chance that I have now. He is a Border Collie and loves to snuggle with anyone.|`|OgdOrWfQaa	my favorite is the dog the best animal and you can play with it|`|QWaspeg7aa	My cat that I have at the moment, Maggie. She's my favourite because you know when you decide you want a pet and there's loads of things you hope your pet will be, like friendly and affectionate and well-behaved and all that? She's absolutely everything I want in a cat, she sleeps next to me, she doesn't wee where she's not supposed to, she doesn't bite or get aggressive, she lets you stroke her for literally hours, she head-butts things she likes, she blinks back at me, she's playful, I could go on. I think she might be a figment of my imagination sometimes because cats just shouldn't be that good. On top of all that, she's beautiful (ginger and brown tabby with white and she's got huge green eyes). I love her so much I could eat her.|`|ZKw46efXaa	my dog jack! he is absolutely gorgeous!!!!|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Everyone was a favourite right from the first mouse I bought for a shilling (five pence) to the current rescued moggies who own me.|`|a6138e092d07f6d19d5c478c75935469aa	My Labrador Bonkers. Yes that really is his name lol. The reason why is because he is so empathic. He knows when I'm sad, He knows when I am happy even when I'm angry. ( never with him lol OK sometimes but all he has to do is drop his ears lower his head and give me the I'm sorry daddy all pathetic like and its impossible to be angry with him. He is a dog in a million he really is my best friend. He is so loyal well unless someone has got something better to eat than I got lol. No seriously I trust him with my life and my girlfriends life even with my kids life. He is just so special.    Great Question BTW have a star!!!|`|TUqu6Hkaaa	fish because they as so warm and loving.|`|nJOYHuyZaa	I had a cat that was like my child, I loved him so much.  He use to protect me like a dog if someone came over & got too close to me. If I called him, he came running, he was waiting for me when I came home from work & slept w/ me under the covers @ night.  He was more like a dog than a cat. He was the size of a small dog.  He weighed 22lbs & was very long for a cat.  He was a purebred Rag Doll & purebred animals tend to have health problems. He got Diabetes & died. It took years to get over it.  I tend to not let myself get too attached to my animals now.|`|e598a4a2cc577e31e93cb794b800a568aa	he died last Thanksgiving.  a Golden Retrv. named Mr. Malibu.  he saved my life more than once.|`|NXwzuv3Paa	my orange long haired tabby. he was my first pet i had when i moved out of parents house. he kept me company.|`|BXQUl2zwaa	my dog XD he runs into sofa's and pee's on my brothers shoes :)  best dog ever lol|`|vZxrQh4Jaa	My ferret, Panda !

She has the best character and is always there for me and me for her!|`|rCu0cB75aa	I loved all my pets but i grew an attachment to my bearded dragon, Magic. I found him one day at the bottom of the cage eaten alive by crickets...I was crying for weeks! Also, pet rats make the most awesome pets because they're low maintence, REALLY REALLY intelligent, easily trainable and naturally love people. They are only two-three bucks and cheap to feed. They love to cuddle, they never bite and are really entertaining. I'm serious!! You should get one!!|`|uyQppMYLaa	One of my cats. She's called Midnight but we call her Flop, because, well, she flops. Seriously. She stretched out her back legs and then the just go from beneath her and she collapses on the floor. She does it for attention because she knows we always give her fuss when she does that, But she's the sweetest natured cat I've ever had. She regularly climbs on your lap, starts padding you and then starts sucking your clothes. It's adorable. She purrs like mad. She's just so affectionate. I love her to bits. Although I do love my other cat and my guinea pigs too.|`|w5sK75MPaa	I had a lil dog named Josie when I was a kid. Some prick neighbor ran over him with his car. Within a couple weeks the guy ran over another neighbor's dog with his motorcycle.   I still miss lil Josie because he was such a lovable lil pet and he was my friend.|`|mTdU6XZMaa	i had 2 dogs in a lifetime..and about 20 cats(started with one) but we owned a huge house in a field where it was fine for them..    my first dog dies when i was really young(around 4)and i know i loved her(i always loved dogs the most) but the feeling has gone away with age and she dies peacefully of old age.It was a doberman breed.    now i have a yorkshire terrier and he is so clever,he reacts to so many words and actions.  He is amazing,caring and sweet.  when ur suppose to teach a dog one work for each meaning...    i.e lets go.park.walkies.  all different words with the same meaning to him and her understands it in all different tones as those words are not only used when speaking to him but in a conversation.He reacts to them and is very bright.  i was told many times that he is exceptionally cute and since he is amazingly clever he can win many contests.  But hes more of a little baby to me(well i am 15) but like a little person who loves me,and i adore him for it.|`|DFhHDavgaa	My second dog.  Why? Because he's adorable. The way he acts can apparently make me laugh, though sometimes I'm in a really bad mood.   I just have so much fun. Seriously. :D|`|4rdKpvPGaa	had a goldfish once

I skip both kinds of questions.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	I don't read long questions.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I do not answer the long ones.

ATSLuU12aa	Well this is true. They are very specific. But if he's wanting to much out of you..then you shouldn't be with him. It's nice that he tell's you that your beautiful, but if he's not there emotionally..then that relationship is doomed. <br>  <br>  Trust me i've had experience.<br>  <br>  My dad is a pisces and he was always telling my mom to dress better...which always put my mom in the worst situation.<br>  <br>  A relationship should never be based on what someone looks like. It's supposed to be based on what their personality is.|`|ojAo1U1caa	Get used to stuff like this!<br>  <br>  My male best friend is a Pisces, and as much as he is sweet ad funny, he is extremely materialistic!<br>  <br>  We all have our faults ARIES! : P|`|eT6SsCaraa	I'm a Pisces, and I'm really not materialistic at all..

If you tell a Libra that your dining chair broke, they'll say, "Oh, I just got an ENTIRE set of chairs from Pottery Barn".  It's so annoying.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Scorpio
siuC4LNWaa	for me leos and some gemini's|`|YRIqfDHuaa	I think a Leo probably would.That's because they tend to be really greedy and like materialistic things. Other possibilities are Libra, but I don't think they'd steal it from you behind your back, they'd probably be able to charm you into giving them money. Cancers could probably steal money from you too, they're really good at manipulating other people's feelings and they could get you to give them money. The thing is they'd probably be feel bad in the end and find a way to pay you back. But most water signs would be able to sneak around and steal it from you while you're not looking. A Libra would probably steal from you, but it would be more impulsive- I know a few Libras that are kleptomaniacs. <br>  <br>  Get to know the people that you trust and you shouldn't have a problem with stealing though :]|`|oX7M4FoIaa	I don't know. I'd say a Fire or Air sign will just do it without thinking of the consequences. Water signs are more prone to do it when they they no one is watching or to support their substance abuse. Earth signs do it the white collar kind of way cause they are smart about money laundering.|`|QGBYOLIxaa	Leo. Every leo I know is always trying to steal something they want, but cannot afford because leos like attention and know that high status and materials get a lot of attention.|`|mka6cRCWaa	scorpio - they are jealous, must have what people have that they don't have<br>  virgo - they just have psychological issues|`|O21k4xn1aa	Taurus.|`|KQjhOdsIaa	scorpio|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Gemini...the 'twin' sign. One steals while the other is not looking...Only kidding. A zodiac sign does not predict or determine whether a person will steal or not. Good morals, upbringing, and conscience will.|`|6oASoFr7aa	That's crazy because I use to know so many ppl who steal. From personal experience, i knew an aries we called keith the master thief,  (this not his real name but we called him that) but its this one Libra chick, who is a notorious career booster. I actually read this sign is most likely to steal and get off into the wrong crowd. I swear I'm not lying. Libra's might be laid back, but there minds are out there.|`|9DYiyQbGaa	My old scorpio friend stole friends, attention, info on me, and anything else for power.|`|AA12215623	Scorpios.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Scorpio. For sure, unless they are a close friend, than they'll never steal from you
oX7M4FoIaa	Aquarius|`|mka6cRCWaa	scorpio & aries - they have such huge egos that they only like people that are similar to themselves so will support these people when they do bad things|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius and Scorpio|`|1yTe0jfRaa	capricorn - they know what it takes to get to the top and sometimes, the ones at the top aren't exactly the best of people.

Lol.<br>  <br>  I think it's downright f*cking hilarious how many people are so freaked out by calling someone they meet online.  Unless you're underage or have a serious social problem that hinders you from being able to detect the freaks from the norm then there's no harm.  Besides...think about how many people actually meet friends online that they email every day...it's 2009 not 1909.  (I said that somewhere else yesterday too...)<br>  <br>  ** edit **<br>  <br>  And yes...like you've been warned by so many of these answers...I might be one of those pervs or something.|`|AA10591203	There are a couple I've called, much easier than typing in IM or email for me...|`|q8MVZtmEaa	That'd be dumb.

DS21ekeJaa	No. The marketing value of larger families is amazing and somehow cheapens their decision to have the children that grace their families. I can't watch John and Kate Plus Eight or shows about the Christian family that has 18 kids and will embrace all that God sends.......Why not give 2 million per kid to the mother that chooses to have her babies even though she has no job or the father bugs out on her or she is working and supporting her children without welfare or government help and is doing a great job at it?|`|vF8DsOfRaa	Not at all and shame on the people that would pay that.

I love kids too,but I'm not going for a world record  no,she should do as the rest of us do and NOT get payed to be a parent...|`|uqMK3rUZaa	No, that's ridiculous!

Rafe comes to visit Sami and EJ get way jealous which starts arguments with Nicole and EJ. but i also think that Rafe is going to try and convince her to tell EJ about the baby so she will try and Nicole suggests that they get a test to see who the parents are (and since it's Mia's she knows that it won't show that EJ is the father. i see Sami figuring out that Sydney's is hers soon though. (also i heard that Philip figures out Nicoles secret somehow. hmm we'll see how that goes) well thats all i got on that one...next<br>  <br>  (you mean Melanie not Tiffany) Stephanie breaks up with Philip. Melanie trys to get with Philip i think that either Philip makes the mistakes and goes with Melanie or he tricks her and pretends to go with her so he can keep the project. he is all business most of the time and i don't think that he likes her at all she is such a b****!<br>  <br>  omg new update!!

Nicole is threatened and fights with EJ over problems with Sami.  Phillip recognizes things are right with Nicole and EJ and does some investigation to use against EJ for the fuel project.  Of course EJ is going to remain clueless.  Will returns and Kaylee and Steve leave as Marlena and John did, without any big fanfare.  Chelsea also opted out on her contract renewal and will soon be gone as well as Tony.|`|kELOzS8Faa	Sammy is voted off the island.

We talked a few minutes and I got an autograph for my brother who is a fan.    Also, I'm seen celebrities without meeting them, like Lucille Ball and her bodyguard doing her exercise walk around her house (in the 90s), when I visited Los Angeles or a presidential canditate at a town house, doing a speech or any concert I'm ever been too (it's fun if you get a pass backstage).|`|e598a4a2cc577e31e93cb794b800a568aa	yeah, but the list is kinda long.....

ykIleAQ7aa	Well they say we cling to our mothers, cry at the drop of the hat. Overly sensitive, fat, whiny and clingy.<br>  Also we are looked at as very motherly, kind people, who always think of others, family orientated, good cooks.<br>  <br>  ha! I love that i got a TD for saying negative things. Well those are the negatives sterotypes I hear all the time about Cancer. I know I'm not like that. But its funny to see it.|`|Utkdzgfgaa	I don't know any stereotypes of it really, but one of my best friends is a cancer and he just likes to copy other people's styles, which is something that bothers me.|`|zP9MXEaDaa	Nurtures, loving, courteous, emotional, maternal|`|6DSd5d9haa	<a href="http://inall.lovez.it" rel="nofollow">http://inall.lovez.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|6NZeItMAaa	Their great sensitiveness, maternal, depressed.<br>  <br>  This sign is called the paradox of the twelve. A few harmonious people are to be found in it, who as far as known have not given any especial attention to men-tal or spiritual development; but, gener-ally speaking, the genius of the Cancer sign is exceedingly difficult to explain. Those born under it have a persistent will, a clutch of determination, intuition, and purpose.<br>  <br>  Yet they often let go for a slight reason, or for no apparent reason. They are invincible to argument, and cannot be talked out of a thing; but if their feel-ings are hurt, they are apt to lose heart, and abandon whatever they have under-taken. Their great sensitiveness leads them into the most absurd extremes. They are as strong as giants and as weak as infants. These people are fond of travel, often taking long voyages, which are not always successful.<br>  <br>  Those born under Cancer will be gifted in many directions far above the average, if educated  thoroughly.    They have  a very superior intelligence, and an apti-tude for learning new things and work-ing out new principles. They are gener-ous and full of sympathy for the public good, but they demand a full independ-ence to develop the same. They are often capricious, and frequently change their occupation.

gtSlZPbFaa	This is a tuff one for me but I prefer the manga. Dont get me wrong i love to see the action but they cut a LOT of stuff out for the sake of the anime. Each episode spans about 3 or 4 mangas at least sometimes. And it is a hard choice for just one fav but I would have to say a tie between bleach and naruto with hajime no ippo third.|`|FvSbfgHeaa	I think about going to school and returning for more writing..|`|LJSIFpG3aa	the first thing that crosses my mind is the life and death|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	Well i saw this question and Inuyasha popped into my head.|`|i1IE4Yztaa	I would choose manga.  As with books, I enjoy voicing the characters inside my head and having to rely on my imagination.  It's more satisfactory than having it all voiced and shown to me.  Plus, I have loved drawing all my life and like to study the separate panels and marvel at how they make up a coherent story.  <br>  <br>  Monster would be my manga of choice.
12QJ9QMRaa	I go two routes.    If I just need to decompress, I listen to Loreena McKennit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeDzETYtS... , or light Rock and Metal like Nightwish http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdWhlo9b9... , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsQXEkyQx... , something with extreme harmony without being TOO invasive.    Also, things like Joanie Madden's "Song of the Irish Whistle" collections are great for workplace. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_baigr_WV...  They have a non intrusive, ethereal quality to them that doesn't start to subconciously aggravate like so much "Lite Pop" can.     Pretty much ANY of the Narada Collection of World Music actually is extremely soothing.      If I am already pissed off, then soothing won't work for me.   What I need to do is ride the swell of Emotion and let the anger or frustration burn itself out.    At that point there is no better medicine than MeloDeath, or good Tech stuff, like Orphan Hate http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvsy30uN... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sft-3somu... , Meshuggah http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzIBI3jk... , Arch Enemy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4sk8Eyy-... .  I don't go for "pure" brutal, because the lack of melody just aggravates me more then.    Old Sepultura works too:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR8jc6poC...    Sometimes the best way to soothe the Beast is to let it free to rampage for a while.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	It's all music for me, it does not matter which kind  take care  dave|`|gDxMoBl9aa	It's always great to see Silver!

I've been listening to some electronic (or electronica...I've seen it labeled as both and I don't know what the difference is) stuff lately and that's definitely relaxing for me.  Groups like Team Sleep, Massive Attack and Portishead.    And for me, 80s tracks always put me in the best mood.    I should probably make a playlist with both and keep it in constant rotation here at the office, where anxiousness is in ample supply. :)    Edit: Annoying, obnoxious co-workers...I feel your pain!|`|URO3gDXcaa	the quote is actually '...savage breast'.  anyway peter gabriel solo and old genesis.  pink floyd.  huffamoose.  frank zappa.  human sexual response.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	The stuff with the lightning speed double bass and fast guitar like Cannibal Corpse and Postmortem put me to sleep.

The Cure - Disintegration album is great.  And I would like to suggest Alice Coltrane the wife of famed jazz great John Cotrane.    http://www.imeem.com/people/PQ6EQkc/blog...    Have a great one!    ______________________________________...    Hi Prof, I am doing fine...I had a slight sore throat mostly due to the weather being 60 degrees one day and 25 the next. How's it goin' for  you?|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I've got to go back to a handful of Stevie Wonder tracks. It just gets too groovy to be mad.    Paul Simon's Graceland makes me feel better. Some of his other songs like Hearts and Bones or Saint Judy's Comet, the Coast or Rhythm of the Saints.     A handful of Shins songs like Saint Simon or New Slang mellow me out nicely.    I guess I've got a lot of stuff that I react to like that for different reasons.    *****************  Hey Mr. Bernstein.  How're you doing today?|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Hi Persephone :)    I can actually find just about anything 'soothing' to my moods, depending on where my mind is at the time. So it could be something classical, a bit of Delerium, or some Type O Negative!    I have two CDs that I use the most :  1) "Silence" : this is a collection of the album version and various remixes of the song 'Silence' by Delerium & Sarah McLachlan.   2) "Adagio for Strings" : as above, this is a collection of versions of Samuel Barber's piece, from traditional orchestral versions, to one by Bond, and even a saxophone interpretation.      Wolfie has been working for 3 weeks, but I should be around a bit more now :)|`|RKbmRAR8aa	These are all songs that I can listen to if I've had a bad day and make me feel better:    Sophmore Slump of the Comeback of the Year- fall out boy  Breath- Breaking Benjamin  Everlong- Foo Fighters  Summer's End- Foo Fighters  I Think I'm Paranoid- Garbage  You're Gonna Go Far, Kid- The Offspring  It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish- My Chemical Romance|`|VJAYmZQIaa	When I get real angered I use Opeth to calm down.   Flogging Molly works for a bad day with songs like The Worst Day Since Yesterday and Float.  Couple other random songs I use are:  Voodoo Child - Hendrix  Genesis - Justice  Search and Destroy - Iggy Pop    Just depends on what i'm trying to soothe.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Manosn soothes me, as does Rob Zombie.  They take me away and make me forget who i am.|`|jhYUvRaDaa	I have had some really savage moments I remember and some music has definately altered my mood and maybe saved me from prison on various occasions- It's not always been melodic tunes that has done this though- sometimes it has been something out of the ordinary;    Silverwings- 'Rock and roll are 4 letter words' and 21st century digital boy by Bad Religion are 2 tracks I can remember have had this effect and even Venus in Furs by the Velvet Underground.   Sometimes i have listened to matallica's Nothing else matters and some Zep but only become more agitated- The END by LINKIN PARK definately made me worse and Free's wishing well certainly took me to the brink of being HOMICIDAL - BUT if ever there was a tune to really calm me down it has to be "SIMPLE MAN" by LYNYRD SKYNYRD.   Not everyone is the same and I don't suppose you've all been as foolish as I have (drug abuse that would have killed horses never mind humans) but in all honesty MAN (or woman) has an inbuilt preservation chamber in their mind- If its drugs bending your mind or emotion- MUSIC CAN definately bring you back to earth and keep your mind on what really matters-YOU!     I've found that I can go through hardship or exercise with music yet couldn't with drugs- drugs wether man made or natural have never given me the adrenaline rushes or the peace I have sought.   When they say "music is the drug" they actually mean that music is THE drug because theycan never grow or create anything in comparison.
t2KJijUpaa	Yes youre right Carla is not going to let it go you can tell besides she leaves him ( i think temporarily because of her maturnity leave) but she leaves him because of it and im guessing something horrible and twisted happens because maria and tony get toghter i reckon carla will come back off her maturnity leave and everything will kick off. He will get found out, everyone will realise maria wasnt crazy after all. Or carla will tell Maria i dont think he will kill Carla coz i believe he does truly love her- hard to believe he has a heart, but you can tell|`|eG5W05Pbaa	i know its about time hes got caught out, i think he might try to kill um all just guna hav 2 wait and c, its gunna be a good wk for corrie|`|956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Tony admits the truth to Carla at the factory.  She runs out into the rain and then she is gone.  Carla doesn`t return until after her maternity leave (Autumn) Tony gets close to Maria until the baby is born at least.  I read an interview with Tony a couple of months back and he said he was going to enjoy being on the Street for about a year.  That seems to match the time that Carla returns. I have another shocking story line but I`ll post it under SPOILER ALERT for the people who don`t want to know.                    SPOILER~~~      Steve and Becky get engaged.  Steve gives her the ring he had given to Michelle which Michelle is quick to point out.

But various "near rhymes" might work, depending on the setting: The trick is to match MOST of the sounds, and have the ones that don't match perfectly as close as possible.    1) Adding an unaccented vowel may work the best, since the added vowel is scarcely pronounced (a swallowed or "schewa" sound), as in:  (com)pliant, defiant, giant, reliant     2) use a somewhat related vowel sound -- a combined vowel sound (or "diphthong") that ends the same way   a) "long a" (since it also ends with a "ee" sound, as does the "long i" of pint)  ain't, faint, paint, saint  works well is some dialects (e.g., Cockney), so-so in most    b) "oi" which likewise ends with a long "ee" sound:  anoint, appoint, joint, point    2) By a variation in the final consonants    a) leaving out the "n" -- ite words (many!)   bite, blight, bright, cite, delight, fight, height, indict, invite, kite, light, might, night, sight, site, slight, spite, sprite, tight, white    b) use the voiced sound /d/ instead of unvoiced /t/ at the end:  behind, bind, blind, find, grind, hind, kind, mind, remind, (re)wind, rind, combined, defined, dined, divined, fined, inclined, lined, mined, shined, signed, spined, wined    Notice that WHERE you use the words in a poem will determine just how strong or exact the rhyme needs to be. (For example, humorous verse, like a limerick, will often be fine with imperfect rhymes... or even "dialectal rhymes", e.g., pronouncing the whole thing --or key words-- with a regional accent [Cockney in this case].)|`|ne2sEeLJaa	"Kind", kind of rhymes a bit, but you have to miss the "T" sound.  I was gonna say, "Mint", But I do know you actually mean "Pint" as in a pint of milk. lol     Oh how about, "Mite", as in little mite.. lol     What rhymes with Orange?

In other words, they're too busy!|`|CQUuCpTQaa	I guess. I talk to people though, say 'hi' or 'morning' or just smile. But if they're completely ignoring me then too bad for them.|`|cH2WNPuvaa	People will walk with their head down if they are sad, insecure, shy, embarrassed, or they don't want to talk to you.    It is quite common for younger people to do this.  If you really want to know, ask the person!|`|F6YPGh9Raa	not a stereotype, however most people who tend to look at their feet are insecure, they feel inferior, therefore they are "hiding":   people with confidence and high esteem, place value upon themselves and look people in the eye, when walking or speaking.......most people who train themselves to do this, if having self esteem issues, will realize their value when someone approaches them and either starts a convo, or nods a greeting....also the ability to state the obvious "good morning, afternoon, evening, or just hi, hello, have a good day....etc" not only shows your own value, it promotes the value of others....a kind word spoken sincerely does much for the confidence level, and your stature shows it!?|`|Py7Rf3D8aa	Avoiding eye contact, that's awkward to walk down the hall and see someone staring at you.|`|mRnBlskBaa	I like adams answer, plus i think its biological|`|AA11618168	Sorry, it's just you.  This never happens to anyone else.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	Not in my experience maybe you look like a serial killer|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	It depends who the other person is!|`|KN36rGMvaa	I've never noticed that.        Cheers  -Will|`|7R7e6yX5aa	not where i work-we fart as we walk by each other or say"hi"|`|pl2SocVKaa	yeah|`|X40Ww89qaa	they don't want to have anything to do with you|`|8594745e2a35941633af216a35c6cc9caa	They don't want the awkwardness. I sometimes keep my head down when i pass people i know because i don't feel like saying 'hi' or anything. It's a i-didn't-see-you-so-i-won't-need-to-awkn... type of thing.    Although, it's better to just keep your head up and look straight ahead
KdcansIyaa	Oh yeah i do it more than i should. Whats the point of writing something and not coming back and checking it. You do it all the time and it carries on a convo just fine. Good stuff!|`|hmbc7MCiaa	I don't think it's weird, I do it sometimes.  Especially when I really appreciate someone's answer or want to question them further about what they said.|`|cK5HwIBfaa	yeah, because we humans are really concerned about what people think.|`|cumhOqjXaa	i dont ad comments i rarely do that.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Yes i do. sometimes, not with all questions just those were the asker replies or the funny ones or the ones with many answers and arguements lol.

Go by the diet that is on the their website or there is a list of what you can eat on the package. Exercise and drink lots of water. This worked for me and I lost probably 10 pounds. It will work if you do it right.<br>  Don't get the powdered stuff it is gross and is really chalky tasty. Get the premade in the cans.|`|15nnW3aLaa	i TRiED, iT TASTES AWFUL, EVEN THE (SUPPOSED TO BE DELiCiOUS) MILKSHAKES.|`|Z3bjHCZpaa	ew it sucked|`|wJdCXU27aa	I am using slimquick packets (mix with water) I have lost 33lbs in 3 months and 2 weeks. I am following their online exercise and diet. I am really happy with the results. I have never used a supplement before  and have found it really helpful. I always have exercised- I just have a wicked sweet tooth and blame my weight gain/fat on that. I find that now I don't crave sweets as long as I stay away from them. I have good energy using the packets and I keep losing weight. I am thrilled. Good luck, cheers

y6wikiJDaa	In my opinion, I think a strong Sagittarius, Leo or Taurus influence (among others) can make people the funniest. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius are the natural jokers of the zodiac. Vince Vaughn has a Sagittarius Moon. Jon Stewart is a Sagittarius, as well as Ben Stiller and Christina Applegate. <br>  <br>  Leos love to entertain. Adam Sandler's Mars is in Leo. Dave Chappelle has Mercury in Leo. James Franco (Pineapple Express) has Mars and Saturn in Leo. Chris Farley is a Leo Rising.<br>  <br>  Taurus have a practical humor that's just hilarious. Dane Cook has his Moon, Venus and Mars in Taurus. Dave Chappelle and Vince Vaughn have their Mars in Taurus. James Franco has Venus in Taurus. Tina Fey, Sun and Mercury in Taurus.<br>  <br>  I found this article that shows how some think Sagittarius and Scorpio make the most popular comedians, if you wanted to check it out. <a href="http://brightstarlights.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/brilliant-comedians-the-scorpio-saggitarius-connection/" rel="nofollow">http://brightstarlights.wordpress.com/20...</a>|`|MHqcJsJWaa	If someone can make you laugh without putting anyone down|`|HZxX9ke8aa	one can be funny in numerous ways;<br>  <br>  be smart, have quick wits and a bit tactless like john stewart or act goofy, make a lot facial gestures and whatever like rowan atkinson or do both like jim carrey.<br>  <br>  without good brains you can only be a clown. so mercury is much more important than everything else i believe. (john stewart has a mercury sun conjuction in 9th house)
B7WIZdglaa	I personally think im pretty damn funny. I'm sarcastic, and sometimes my humor is a little dry, sometimes it's a little sadistic. It depends on my audience. I'd say more people than not think i'm funny.<br>  <br>  Aqua sun/leo moon/sagg rising|`|nwdwKnS7aa	Yes, I am funny.

It's because we understand people and how ridiculous everyone can be, and can see the humor in that. Also the sound of laughter is very comfortable, and comfort is very important to Cancer also. An extroverted rising sign like your gemini and my leo also helps.|`|d2uGruHiaa	People tell me that I am, but then again, they also tell me that I can be a little bit too serious. Maybe it's because I'm a Capricorn Sun with a Virgo Moon and a Cancer Rising.<br>  <br>  But they like my sense of humor anyways. Sometimes, I hurt people, but I don't intend for it to be that way. ):|`|PyAgEejnaa	when i'm scatterbrained, freaking out and saying random things, ppl find it funny, though i'm not trying to be funny. i'm pretty witty/sarcastic too and goofy at the same time. i just like laughing...i can find humor in most things, but the type of humor usually depends on the situation. <br>  <br>  libra sun<br>  sag moon (there seems to be a lot of sag moons on here)<br>  virgo rising|`|ythN9BQgaa	I'm not good at making witty jokes/answers but people laugh a lot when I act stupid and random.

ttJTNVpqaa	Leo will win the physical because they are big and stupid   but Scorpio will win the mental fight because they are little  untrustworthy  mental terrorist|`|AQwoCjj3aa	I like to see that fight, I think it would be Leo though.|`|plBXp91Daa	In a physical fight probably the Leo man would win coz Leo's can be very angry. And in mental fight Scorpio man. I wonder how it would be when a Leo & Scorpio are friends.|`|jcxtxBm0aa	umm what does signs has to do with a battle...if the opponent is stronger than he might win but if you want an answer than scorpio...i guess =D|`|icZARsMtaa	Well, I can tell you from experience, who would win between two females!    Leo female: She was suuuuch a **** talker. Her ex boyfriend innocently flirted with me, and she felt I betrayed her for that. That apparently made me a ****, and she went on to using my personal matters, against me in a verbal fight. Her choice of event didn't affect me, but if she would have really hit my weak spot, it could have easily turned chaotic.     Scorpio female: I attempted to be the mature one and I told her that he was just joking, he has his own free will, and that I was sorry for the inconvenience.     Leo female: She didn't take that as I hoped, but didn't expect her to. She kept pushing and pushing..    Scorpio female: I just stopped responding after that one message, and wrote out a BIG message that would probably make her feel like the scum of the Earth, that I was going to send her. Once I was done with it, my friend said, "don't ever show that to another human being. She would kill herself." Being the emotional person I am, I just deleted it, and continued with life.     If that would have went physical, I would have won. She was all talk. That's what she is. Not to say that all Leos are, but she certainly was. You can't go in a fight, expecting to win with no experience, and that's what she would have done. Maybe that would have been a wake up call for her? Oh, well.     Everyone keeps saying Leo males would win against Scorpio males, but I really have to disagree. Every Scorpio male I know, knows how to get by. More than likely, Leos would just be defending themselves.|`|ntj9WfzYaa	Scorpio would win both!!|`|YAWkCPqYaa	Leo every time|`|7p3TCz3qaa	Sun signs can't give you that information.Astrology can't answer your first question,Mercury signs and aspects needed to answer the second.|`|IYsuY0KHaa	I do not like leos|`|GLDXjJfaaa	i dislike both, capricorns too.    saggitarius and aqua would beat all three lol, mentally and physically ooh and mr aries.|`|GqRNBTV9aa	Leo's are too open and honest whereas Scorpio's would do whatever it took to win. I don't know who would win in a fight but if Scorpio loses he goes back for revenge.     At least according to their profiles.|`|CRk1goz4aa	The Scorpio would keep coming back. If Leo won/lost they'd get over it and move on and beyond. The Scorpio will learn from what went wrong and come back meaner and meaner until their prey is dead. We (i'm a Scorpio) go to kill!     Plus, the Leo's feelings get hurt kinda easily. I dated and Leo and allowed him to have his say, but whenever I finally got pissed and said one comment, it was OVER!|`|UgRSeCa3aa	I think Leo would win but a Scorpio would win the second time when he had time to process it and get really mad.|`|39a80d0f5ce15f073f624db93d68ca04aa	well i have been told that there are three types of Leos. the cub, the lion and the sun. the cub is like a child, easily hurt, doesn't like much challenges, prefers peace over violence.     and then you have the lion, he is the ferocious, violent beast when he needs to be. the chances are the scorpio would most likely be in conflict with this type of Leo because these Leo are (like scorpio) after power therefore they compete at the same ground. the lions don't give a second chance and expect others to be the same. when in a fight, they will end all tensions right there and then, they would even go for the kill if necessary. these Leo have a lot in common with Aries so expect blood and violence when in a fight with them.     finally there is the sun. these Leo are like father figures, they are wise, intelligent and diplomatic. they would always offer the hand of peace before anything else. these Leo would most likely be good friends with the wild signs like Aries and scorpio because they understand the nature of humans and use it to widen their circle of friends.     scorpio on the other hand is like a criminal. sneaky, moves in the shadows and attacks when you least expect it. depending on which type of Leo they come up against, they can easily defeat the cub, would most likely regret opposing the lion and would be at peace with the sun.|`|AA11969182	Not a good combination

AA12390047	Love Kendall taking charge again.  She's proving she is her mother's daughter.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Now that's a hard one because Kendall changes from day to day. I guess you could say that she is a character that I love to hate.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I have a love/hate relationship with Kendall. When she is behaving herself, I like her, when she is doing stupid, bonehead things I want to smack her around!|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Kendall,seriously, needs to take a chill pill.  Did you see the glare she gave her  'beloved' sis Binky when she announced she wasn't moving to Paris.  WOW  cold as ice.   I'm surprised everyone doesn't lower their heads, and back out of the room when they leave Kendall's room  lol.  Yeah, she's been thru oh so much,  but on the other hand, she has OH SO much,,so get a grip girl , there is a limit to how much of your  "High and Mighty" everyone can tolerate.....|`|s1utniuvaa	I hate her right now... after all she has done and now she wants to be a Bi*ch... I bet they will try to make some twist that it has something to do with Josh's heart... blah|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I like her more now ...She definitely  has Erica's genes.|`|6kBAj12gaa	I love Kendal, but in a sense right now she is acting crazy, but at the same time it is understandable because of everything that is happening...i don't think i would be in the best of moods either if i woke up 3 months later and had all that dumped on my shoulders too!<br>  <br>  I am kinda wondering about her character though...she has been acting different and spiteful since she woke up...do we think it is because she has her brothers heart in her and somehow he is living in her that is causing her craziness...not in a weird psychotic way...but you know..<br>  <br>  <br>  lol does that make sense?|`|AA11202477	Considering where she is compared to where she came from, I like her now. When the character first came to PV, she was so totally off the chain with hate & jealousy it was scary. She's at least settled into a personality where most of the time, there are people who matter besides her. Most people seem to think she's being unreasonable towards Bianca right now, well, I'm not one of them. I think Kendall is the only person with a reasonable right to be angry at this point. Bianca says Reese "betrayed me with my sister's husband". Well, she did the exact same thing. At least Reese wasn't Kendall's sister. And Zach was just stupid. He knew better. At least he knows he was stupid. What scares me is that we're getting ready to see some of the old Kendall - the one who would do absolutely anything to get her point across, whatever it was. And my $$ says Ryan is going to get some whether he wants it or not. Pay back's a you-know-what and her name is Kendall.|`|AA11714109	i used to love her to death but now i think she really need to lighten up. i can understand her not wanting reese around. but the way zach sat by her bed day and night she could warm up to him a little. he is even taking the fall for her involving greenlee.and as fine as zach is i would be all over him.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	That's a good question.  I don't like how Kendall ACTS at times (well, most the time) but deep down, I like her and want her to be ok.  Sort of like you would a sister maybe.  I never wish anything bad on her.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think she's acting weird, too.  Mostly just really cold and flat personality.|`|AA11261694	i hate kendal

V3LUv44Naa	Hello Lady Aquarius. I too am an Aquarius.<br>  <br>  I know that fantasies are very common and I don't think that you should be ashamed of it.  I know it feels bad to think about another man. On top of that to think about a man that is not even better than your man in the sack (for lack of better words). But I want you to know that first it is very natural to have fantasies. <br>  I think that you should channel what it is that you valued about your X that you slept with twice. Seriously I think that it is an subconscious thought of not being in a relationship that is turning you on. However you must put that part of you to rest because you have made the decision to be in a marriage. Due to this it does sound like a case of COVETING THE SINGLE LIFE. <br>  You must reinvent your new self. This part of you that has decided to give up the confusion that comes along with not being stable. <br>  <br>  I think that you have a good guy for being willing to show that he is boos is the sack by allowing another man in your bed, but if it is something that you feel you could not handel out of him wait until you can. Then when it is his turn you can show him who IS THE NAUGHTIEST IN THE SACK (between you and Other girl... future advice is to out due her completely and dominate the situation..force yourself to tell them what to do) U might like it and I am sure he will be turned on just by your authority.|`|a1XEf8lKaa	Wow, I guess in this situationits a little different for each indiviual.<br>  I personally would not want to be in a relationship with someone who would ever want to share me with another guy, even if he thought that it was going to make me happy.  But everyone is different, some people can have an open relationship and be perfectly happy.... I do not think that it has anything to do with your signs, all though I am a big believer in signs, I think that it may go deaper than that for you.   Maybe you should push the wedding back a little, there is no rush to get married, you do have your whole life ahead of you....  I know that I am not much help but I wish you the best of luck on this one!|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I don't think your ready for marriage and neither is you fiance.  If you talking about being with someone and he's mentioning 3 ways this is a sign of not being ready to be with one person forever. There is nothing wrong with calling it off or just waiting awhile until everyone is ready. <br>  If your in your 20's than I know your not ready. This isn't the dark ages and no one in there 20's should be getting married.  You change to much from 20-30.  Please call off the marriage and take time to learn who you are. God Bless you all!|`|B7WIZdglaa	Don't be sorry if this offended someone. This is your situation and no one has any reason to judge you. I can understand where your coming from, i'm sort of in the same boat. I have a boyfriend whom I am in a very serious relationship with and I love him very much, and I also have this other guy that I can't stop thinking about. I have never slept with this other guy, but I did kiss him. I randomly talk to him and see him out.. but he knows about my boyfriend so he keeps a safe distance away. I really do like the other guy though. <br>  <br>  I'm also confused about the 3way thing? Was he open to a 3way w/another girl, or another guy? Either way, Don't do it! It only ruins things. Keep your relationship between you two, no one else.<br>  <br>  If you have no real interest in this other guy, and you know he does not compare to your fiance, then I would stop talking to him for a while. I think this is a case of cold feet and your starting to get scared about being w/one guy forever. You will be ok. Fight the urges, or you might really regret it later.

tLI94qWNaa	The Glass Slipper    In a small pleasant European village, there is one unhappy person: Ella. She is despised by everyone, and mistreated by her step-mother and step-sisters. Out feeling miserable one day, Ella meets a handsome young man, who falls for her. He is really Prince Charles, the son of the Duke, but he tells her he is the son of the cook, and invites her to a great ball at the Duke's castle. A strange woman who lives in the mountains by herself befriends Ella, and dresses her up so she can attend the ball. She goes, and is a great success, but must run out at midnight. In her haste, she drops a single glass slipper. The Prince uses the slipper to find her.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Maybe this one called One for the Book (1940) starring Betty Hutton, part musical--http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279290/  (Just a guess since there have been MANY Cinderella movies made over the years)  EDIT: I agree with the other responders that you are probably thinking of The Glass Slipper from the mid-50's, not the 40's.|`|SkCM55lMaa	It's called The Glass Slipper.     x|`|AA10197629	its called ella enchanted.i used to wwatch that movie all the time.it stars anne hathaway and hugh dancey(i think).

e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Beetlejuice<br>  <br>  Based off the 1988 film Beetle Juice about a deceased couple that starts running around with "the ghost with the most" who promises to get some annoying yuppies out of their house.  The comedy horror flick was so popular with kids the animated series was spun off. <br>  <br>  According to IMDB, the film is listed as "Beetle Juice" but that's not how it's spelled in the film (the title character takes out an ad in a ghost newspaper and the couple have a hard time pronouncing it in order to say it 3 times to set him loose).  Anyway, it was released in 1988, starring Winona Ryder as Lydia, directed by Tim Burton.  Beeltejuice himself was played by Michael Keaton.<br>  <br>  Beatlegeuce is Greek for armpit or something, there's a star in the sky that's named that because it's Orion's armpit.<br>  <br>  The animated series was also created by Tim Burton.  It ran for 4 seasons, beginning in 1989 on network TV before being sold to Cartoon Network upon it's cancellation and post-series syndication run.|`|zSJqiBLwaa	Beetlejuice|`|7NtMbVCJaa	The list of 90's cartoon network show I know of are:<br>  The Flintstones<br>  Huckleberry Hound<br>  Fantastic Four (60s)<br>  Superfriends<br>  Wally Gator<br>  Smurfs<br>  Thundercats <br>  The Jetsons<br>  Rocky & Bullwinkle<br>  Droopy<br>  Looney Tunes<br>  Sailor Moon<br>  Yogi Bear<br>  Top Cat<br>  Quick Draw McGraw<br>  Tom & Jerry<br>  Scooby Doo<br>  Wacky Races<br>  Jabberjaw<br>  Josie and the Pussycats<br>  Thundar the Barbarian<br>  Johnny Bravo<br>  Dexter's Lab<br>  Alvin & the Chipmunks<br>  Captain Planet<br>  Secret Squirrel<br>  Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon<br>  Hong Kong Phooey<br>  Two Stupid Dogs<br>  Gumby<br>  Magilla Gorilla<br>  Birdman<br>  The Snorks<br>  Silverhawks<br>  Swat Kats<br>  Underdog<br>  <br>  Is any of them it?

That's not patriotism, that's ignorant, vengeful hate. One of the ugliest, most anti-American songs I've ever heard.|`|2c7PfLNHaa	Does that Blue Moon Ever Shine on You is very nice.

n1SVl991aa	Here's what I think: I think that you just want attention from random people on the internet (desperate much?) because you don't get enough in real life. You want people to say "You look good" or "No you are perfect" But here's the truth: YOU are a dumb@ss.<br>  <br>  And I agree with the other guy that said, you are skinny, but your face is extremely ugly LMFAO.

j7rBM2yTaa	IMAX is a 70mm format film and each frame is 3 times bigger than the old 35mm film. This captures more detail and so it can be projected onto a much bigger screen.    The screens are so big (5 stories high) that they fill your field of view, which gives the impression that you're actually there.|`|bCTbcKWTaa	it just means really big and it almost looks 3-D but its not imax is really just what they call the projector. there really kool go to one!|`|Y4RS35M7aa	In some cities, but not all, there is a museum, or a theater, or some place that has an IMAX set-up.  This is a trademark for a huge projection system that takes up the wall and ceiling of an auditorium, giving a "you are there" feeling.  I've seen a number of films (they're usually 20 min. or so, not feature length [100 min]) in IMAX, notably "The Nile," "Under the Sea," "Lewis and Clark" and others.    You have to see IMAX to believe it, but some people don't like it;  it makes them dizzy.    To see if your city has IMAX, put the words "IMAX" and your city into the Y'Search____Web Search box at the top of this page.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	It is filmed in ultra wide format for projecting onto a curved imax screen.
0Re4PPq9aa	POT IS FOR PUSS IES|`|4IyewuLuaa	I've done everything u have but I am addicted to coke right now. I suggest not doing even pot if u don't want to get in that cycle. Alcohol should be ok but u can easily become an alcoholic.  Stay strong|`|NGTuXvM8aa	I've haven't been a big drinker since high school I do however smoke pot daily.And will do Coke about once a year.It really all depends on you and what type of control you have on yourself.Timothy Leary was a Prof from Berkley in the 60's and he writes about how drugs themselves aren't bad...85% of people do some form of drug and out of that 85% only 5% are the ones you actually see abusing them. Many people are like me they go to work they pay their bills raise their kids and smoke pot.I'm not hurting anyone and that includes myself.|`|lO2Nvj81aa	I've used all of those substances many times except cocaine.  I never "abused" any of them though, because there's a time and a place for such uses.  I turned out all right.      If I were you, I'd skip the alcohol.  It's bad news...  Especially if you enjoy the effects of cocaine and E, which are uppers.  Alcohol is a downer, especially when it is abused.      Weed, in my opinion, is perfectly harmless so long as you a) use it in moderation; and b) are responsible (i.e. no driving under the influence).|`|mh5NOsWzaa	Smoked pot for 10 ten years, never once had the urge to want to do coke or E or get a life.    To me pot is addictive. I mean I LOVE smoking pot when i get off work. I think it should be legal and control like alcohol and tobacco. Not to mention the revenue it would bring in. Think about the school that could use the money, less pot dealers, less pot dealers taking up space in jail (although i think theyd just sell coke, far more lucrative), hell 1 out of 4 have tried pot in america. It is a drug yes, but it can be controlled|`|IizPFrELaa	Weed and alcohol will only lead you back to the E and Coke!    You need to stay away from them all|`|dkEUJPhnaa	I think that it's best not to do anything at all personally... you can still enjoy life without addictive substances!

rR9fqQOTaa	Well bittorrent itself is not a website, I use it for anime downloads from dattebayo.com and have never had a problem, no viruses or anything.<br>  <br>  You just have to be careful and research the websites you are planning to download from, you should read the comments left by other users of any site you want to download from and see if they have had any negative experiences with the download.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have an anti virus program just in case though, and check your computer for viruses regularly

This is from a group of russian hackers but dont worry about it being illegal cuz it is relaly not bad at all. Been doing it FOR YEARS!  Its called      mIRC    Follow the steps on how to do it and master it people will help you out its like a global thing. Its in english like 90% of it lol. So you will find hip hop/rap by the thousands i have a 6K Libary and all from this i LOVE mIRC.  Just takes some getting use to.  Plus never got a virus! Good aye?  If you want to take a chance at a virus then try Limewire its free and kidna easy. Download it at download.com or freedownload.com i think it may be. Afetr you download it search the software for Limewire pro that is how you get it to download faster and its better all around. But all in all mIRC|`|Wxb8D6B8aa	realraptalk.com    BAYONTOP.COM    for all the yay area artists and more. Real SLAPPERS THERE!

z8jYprWkaa	No he's with her for the money he'll either get or just plain take.|`|dAn9koABaa	Get of the case....you sad B...........|`|epBOAXUraa	I have mixed feelings and to be truthful, seeing as none of us know Jack or Jade personally, we have no right to speculate.  However, whether he got into this for the fame and money, the tragedy of being around someone with terminal cancer will be affecting him very badly.<br>  <br>  He is making Jade happy in her last few weeks and that is what is important.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I am very suspicious of his motives. If she was still a dental nurse and not a celeb, I wonder if he would even have looked twice at her. I'm sure they were supposed to have got married a while ago and he got cold feet. Now she hasn't got long to live, he can't wait to get her up the aisle. I may be a  cynic, but even if they do sign a pre nup, he will get loads of money for magazine and newspaper deals and do very well for himself.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Well he isn't exactly Brad Pitt in the looks department.<br>  <br>  But probably - he's hit the jackpot.|`|MNja3iwMaa	definately, he can live off her fame, especially now!|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	Yep cause she's ugly as hell|`|bNllesmMaa	I want to believe he does love her.  But being a 21 year old myself, and having many guy friends who are the same age.  Why would he want to be married already?  Most don't even want a relationship, yes he may well really love her and I hope that he does in this case.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	I would like to think its because he loves her.As at this time she needs all the support she can get from him.He seems to make her happy,but as you say they dont seem well suited.But who knows,only he knows the answer to your question.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	publicity fame and the MONEY honey|`|zpIrU1yCaa	I think the fact that he only proposed the day she found out she was dying says it all.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	I think he could be described as a pig farmer !|`|HnccCVlVaa	probably just for the money|`|QCVzUC1baa	well they have been together on and off for 3 yrs so i doubt it although it has crossed my mind!|`|2dJIJr6uaa	yep and of course for the money!|`|vZUHSNn6aa	Oh god without a doubt, hes a immature wee twat. I watched jade last night, he was getting interviewed and i couldn't believe a word he said. It was fake and jade is head over heels in love with him. When she passes on he'll sell the story and make a mint. What its most sickening is some of the youtube stuff, really appalling comments. As i have said in previous posts im not a fan and i don't hate her. I feel heartsick for those two wee boys and her dying at 27,  its no age.|`|caEcOdORaa	Yes definately cashing in here he's got nothing to loose, he's already cheated on her so lacks morals and as we see a violent character,I think he has the personality of a piece of wood,how simple this short term arrangement is for him,scum of the earth.I wonder who his next victim will be?|`|zxzfmXDTaa	Leave them alone let them have there fairy tale|`|CNRPR22Oaa	He needs the money to go and buy new golf clubs.|`|dYI2r7Ylaa	I hope not, but it has crossed my mind too...|`|N3gZO3Ajaa	yep i do. 100%|`|nPa5QFOeaa	yep i do. 100%

Bi51WJd7aa	Great question, I've always wondered about that. I think she is OBVIOUSLY the main one and in every group there's always one that stands out, ie : Beyonce (Destiny's Child). But Nicole is like the STAR and the rest are just the 'back-up dancers'. I would hate to just fade into the background like one of them, I rather wouldn't be part of a group. Anyway, Nicole is HOT and she should just go solo, I think.|`|nqlk9iUCaa	They're a BURLESQUE group  And Robin who manages them put her as the Lead, and It's worked|`|mKvBPA7baa	gud question....im also wondering that b4......idk|`|RoTLnFGZaa	probably because the back up girls look like transvesdites.|`|iWwsOK5Baa	Nicole's got the best voice out of all of them... and she looks unique. :)

hmsCFQocaa	Back news: T. I. got busted on a weapons charge.<br>  <br>  Current news: He won't have to do much actual time, even though he's got a 366 day sentence.<br>  <br>  Future news: Guess how much money he's going to make calling himself a bad guy rapper now.|`|AA11202477	The preliminary sentence was 1 year 1 day after 1000 hours of community service to be performed prior to the sentence which begins in March 2009. If the courts act as they have in the past and he's done more than his 1000 hours, they may reduce the sentence. There is also the possibility that he could early release for good behavior. Regardless, bet he comes out with a new CD ready to record. And I will definitely be there to buy it.|`|0cMVKUnAaa	1 year, 1 day|`|Kf3Et39Qaa	why the hell is he in there? xxx|`|hbIBKQk2aa	On tyra he said a year and a day cause his best friend died in his arms so he presured himself to go to jail cause he felt like a bad friend.

bl8co4hUaa	The Stoned Age (1994, R) - Joe (Michael Kopelow) and Hubbs (Bradford Tatum) are two So-Cal dudes looking for a good time in this comedy. Their usual agenda is to drive around L.A. all night, but on this particular evening they have a goal: to find beautiful girls and have lots of sex. As luck would have it, they soon meet Tack (Clifton Collins Jr.), who hooks them up with two lovely foreign girls also out looking to get lucky. Will the boys finally score? <br>  <br>  Backbeat (1994, R) - This gritty, hard-driving and energetic drama chronicling The Beatles' ascendance to fame in Hamburg's club circuit centers on the true story of "fifth Beatle" Stu Sutcliffe and his close relationship with John Lennon. Driven by art rather than music, Sutcliffe ultimately must choose between his true passion and certain superstardom. Stephen Dorff, Ian Hart and Sheryl Lee star.<br>  <br>  Suburbia (1983, R) - Based on her observations of teen runaways, Penelope Spheeris wrote and directed this compelling tale about Evan Johnson (Bill Coyne), who finds refuge with a band of malcontents when household conflict and a sense of worthlessness overwhelm him. Through garage hopping, fights, concerts and death, the kids -- whose binding forces are personal tragedy and punk rock -- hold on to one another like the family they never had.<br>  <br>  Detroit Rock City (1999, R) - In 1978, a Kiss concert was an epoch-making event. For the three teen fans in Detroit Rock City (Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello and Edward Furlong), getting tickets to the sold-out show becomes the focal point of their existence. They'll do anything for tickets -- compete in a strip club's amateur-night contest, take on religious protesters, even rob a convenience store! <br>  <br>  Airheads (1994, PG-13) - The Lone Rangers (Brendan Fraser, Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi) have heavy-metal dreams and a single demo tape they can't get anyone to play. The solution: Hijack an AM rock station and hold the deejays hostage until they agree to broadcast the band's tape. Sandler's "Saturday Night Live" cohorts Chris Farley and Michael McKean round out the cast, along with Judd Nelson, Amy Locane and David Arquette. <br>  <br>  Rock Star (2001, R) - Head-banging -- 1980s style -- makes a comeback with Mark Wahlberg as a lead singer wanna-be who gets to live his wildest dream. In a dizzying turn of events, Chris (Wahlberg) is whisked from anonymity to being frontman for Steel Dragon, the enormously popular metal band he worships. Accompanied on tour by his girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston), Chris soon discovers life in the fast lane is not all it's cracked up to be.<br>  <br>  Tons more, but hard to list them all and I have to get back to work!

SPQdFOwKaa	The secret life of Bees is a movie that centers around a white girl (Dakota Fanning) who has an abusive father (Paul Bettany) and is best friends with a black woman that works in their house. The movie is set in the times when black people were still called "colored", when there was a great level of prejudice against them and they were forced to use different mediums to enjoy the things white people did. When Fanning runs away from home, she finds company in the house of three sisters, who are very kind to her and present to her the nature of love, justice, spirituality and humanity.<br>  <br>  I believe that it's a beautiful movie, but I wasn't very impressed in it. I think it was over-the-top and somewhat superficial for the matter it debated. But, overall, it's a good, human, emotional, strong film.<br>  <br>  <br>  (PS. This question was asked some hours ago - I'm just pasting my already response to that one)

Rmtfm7qnaa	I'm sure you've already asked why the sky is blue, so how about: <br>  Why is/was Pokemon so popular?<br>  Why is black slimming?<br>  Why do vertical stripes make people look taller?<br>  How can some people see auras?<br>  <br>  That should get you started ;-)
WpA7n8Iwaa	I wouldn't medal with it, but if you're really want to get down to brass tacks, you should start by eating aluminum and work your way up.  Hope that you're not metallurgic to anything.  Ore, you could start by eating silver and gold and see if that makes you feel precious.
Rmtfm7qnaa	No, YouTube generally has size restrictions. Since you don't pay for the bandwidth, they have to limit how much they can show and having them high quality would likely take too much space for it to allow it... depending on the length of the movie, at least.

1K82IXnzaa	So i went and tried to look up what you are talking about on the E website. The October article in 2008 was actually a poll to see what sci fi show should come back since Dr. Who and Star Trek are. I know nothing of those shows... but whatever.<br>  <br>  I wish the cast would come back though. The show was great and sadly had to end.  I miss it a lot.

5LxpvXSmaa	i will be sick to my stomach if he does that. I will lose all respect for him and if it is true they will definitely lose alot of viewers.

I am hoping that they meet her parents and that is why it will me very intimate. I hope i do not have to work the next day because if it does happen i won't get any sleep.|`|fl57jdG7aa	I'm not sure if he's right. He seems to be telling the truth. I saw it on utube and i was what? I'll be really mad if that happens. Yeah I'll stop watching the show if it actually does occur.|`|g5RS83paaa	really? I was thinking he would pick Melissa, but maybe because he didn't meet her family. I just went to his website, so he's saying Melissa will be picked and then dumped for Molly. It makes sense because in the promos for the show they keep talking about a big surprise (and they lead you to believe that the surprise is Deanna) if it's true I won't watch the show anymore

Her music is refreshing amid the crappy pop music of today.<br>  <br>  She definitely isn't a great singer (she did sing pretty good on Ellen yesterday however) but she's a pretty good lyricist.<br>  <br>  Even though my taste in music has changed dramatically over the past 2 years, I've still been a Lily fan! lol<br>  <br>  But unfortunately her personal life overshadows her music career. She has a big mouth.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I think she's a fairly good artist, but her attitude completely screws it up for me. She has the same problem as Amy Whinehouse, which is that her personal life is so dramatic, that one forgets what her music is like, and judges based on the personal drama.|`|qLqYSeqRaa	I don't think she's too bad.<br>  She's definitely much better than most pop artists, but I don't listen to her regularly.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Artist yes..<br>  <br>  Singer no<br>  <br>  shes really cranky all the time XD|`|JnH9X34Taa	Ah.

b6Y3sFjsaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  First Act guitars are very poorly made beginners guitars. For much less than $500, you can get a very nice beginners guitar. For $500, you can get a very nice instrument.  I suggest doing research on musiciansfriend.com and guitarcenter.com. <br>  <br>  They offer a wide variety of entry level acoustic guitars in the $100 to $150 range. If you have any specific questions about selecting an instrument, I would be glad to answer your questions. <br>  <br>  As a guitar instructor, I offer the service of meeting new students at a music store to shop for instruments, and so, I don't mind answering any questions you may have.|`|6eb65d4c43950c1dd4d925b156525610aa	NO NO NO NO NO. First Act guitars are horrible. you should really do some research before you just start buying. You can get a guitar of much better quality for 500. Look for brands like fender, gibson, washburn, or any thing at a music store Musiciansfirend.com Zzounds.com hate to be harsh but hope this helps|`|40STiGmvaa	It's a little late to ask when you've ordered it.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm<br>  <a href="http://guitar-classic-guide.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://guitar-classic-guide.blogspot.com</a>|`|iBGkSg50aa	Return it.

If I was the Asian guy in the photo, I would have been saying, "Look, I can do it with no hands!"    However what was more disturbing is the other pic from the same night of 21 year old Justin humping 16 year old Miley.|`|5707339fb54432034d12ac39ea99ebd9aa	yes because the gesture mocks and brings back decades of racism towards Asians.  Spain's basketball team did it and nobody said anything.|`|drRNt5ujaa	what picture?|`|uavxz4S8aa	Yes, of course that picture is DEFINITELY racists!  What's even more ridiculous is there is an Asian guy in the picture.  I'm not surprised if she starts using the "N" word next time.  I don't care if you're a millionaire teenage, because her actions clearly show her ignorance, insensitivity, as well as the fact that money can't buy class.  I can't believe young people actually look up to her.  She's just steps closer to her own downfall.|`|3933561e5bf98d0767553139182fe79eaa	Yes it is. They are making fun of a racial group for the way they look, which is offensive.    Suppose that instead of an asian person in the picture, there was an obese person sitting there. What would you think if Miley and friends all stuffed pillows under their shirts and mocked the way the obese person looked?     This is no different, but since it involves race, it's probably even more insensitive and worse.

d5zEYomEaa	Well where I live (in Los Angeles) all the major channels I used to watch cartoons on, nowadays show infomercials or stupid programming and NO cartoons, unless you go to the Cartoon Network and some other cable channels, where they show the same cartoons they show every day of the week so nothing worht looking forward to. I used to watch stuff like Richie Rich, Carebears and other cartoons that aired only on Saturdays and were on almost all the channels, those were the good old days!|`|gtSlZPbFaa	Because cartoons suck now. I dont know what the problum is but they just put out this worthless bullcrap.

h68Ok5m5aa	H looked like a dead(er) version of Orochimaru. I think hes wasting away from that extensive jutsu. He's apparently sick so I doubt he can hold out for much longer. He'll probably be another Kimimaro and die of his own accord rather than being killed. That, or he'll end up getting his sickest in the end of the battle and make the Pein body weaker, thus Naruto will probably beat his *** and make him look weak even though he destroyed they're whole village.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Nice chapter but what will Naruto's answer be after hearing Nagato?

It makes sense why he's using bodies... since he can't move around... how did he become like that is another mystery... anyway we know his friend Yahiko was killed and so was his family etc... which created this anger in him... He still feels for his friends but his solution to peace is right and yet wrong... I wonder what Naruto can do to change his mind...|`|3ERx4opSaa	i knew that the pain taking to naruto wasnt the real one, i mean why would the real pain have chakra receptors?<br>  <br>  I do not think Naruto will go with pain, because he will remember that gaara was killed from having his bijuu removed, then the fox will come out and he will pummel the last body.|`|6FTocftjaa	yeah..the real body have been reveal in this chapter. konan were guarded pain all the pain. it seem that pein or nagato are out of chakra and hopefully the konoha ninja will found it soon..<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Naruto 436.

BJIo6twUaa	From what i am seeing on wiki about how the movie did, I say its up in the air. If they go by reviews from critics i would say no<br>  <br>  As of December 29, 2008, the review aggregator at Rotten Tomatoes has reported that 9% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 135 reviews.[12] Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 34 out of 100, based on 29 reviews.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_BC_(film)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_BC_(...</a><br>  <br>  However it was number 1 in theaters on opening weekend but that usually dont mean much since its for 1 weekend.<br>  <br>  They may make another one but i wouldnt hold my breath for it.|`|AA10744842	i think not, hun.

rj3mi8vJaa	OMg! I LOVE Fruits Basket. I'm trying to read the manga right now after I watched the whole thing.  I Love Kyo because he's funny and the most lively character in the anime. I also like Shigure Sohma for some reason. I think Tohru should be with Kyo because they have a good chemistry. I like Kyo better. Read the manga and you'll find out who she ends up with. The anime doesn't give out that many details. Online manga www.mangafox.com<br>  Yuki is too quiet and soft to be a good match with Tohru.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	I definitely prefer the manga since the anime stops at the 6th volume and the manga continues till 23 volumes.<br>  lol<br>  <br>  But yeah, awesome manga/okay anime (if only they had finished it....)<br>  It actually makes me wonder now why they haven't. I could understand them stopping it a few years ago, it wasn't as popular as it is now and it was unfinished. But now the manga has come to a close and it has a huge popularity both in Japan and here....<br>  So why not finish it?<br>  <br>  And for your questions:<br>  Fav character is Rin Sohma (the horse).<br>  Tohru should be with Kyo. Always. <br>  x3<br>  Kyo-kun of course. He's way cooler.|`|ActoZyHraa	i loved the series ^_^ <br>  my favorite character was Yuki (thought he was adorable ) <br>  i wanted her to end up with kyo simply because he seemed to <br>  really LIKE her , same with yuki butt his personality was kind of shy<br>  & i think Thoru needed someone like Kyo ^_~|`|qKJUb2qqaa	I personally liked the Manga better.  The Anime was short termed and made me sad.<br>  <br>  My faivrote character is hatsuharu~!   <3<br>  <br>  I don't really like Tohru that much....<br>  <br>  Yuki or Kyou....depends on my mood.  ;P|`|tKYfkEryaa	i loved the series<br>  my favorite charactes is Ayame Sōma because is so funny and<br>  crazy<br>  I think it would be with Kyo<br>  i like more Kyo|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Its great, but not as the manga though. <br>  <br>  Fav character: Hatori Sohma<br>  <br>  Tohru should be with Kyo<br>  <br>  I like Kyo better|`|2wgEsVmsaa	I adore it. I am currently collecting the manga to read, too.
b5ff1a7351518399ad114718fdc0a8f3aa	different regions of the same movie often have slight differences, eg better extras or an uncut movie on the american version when comparing to the uk one, so you may prefer to buy your chosen movie from this different region as a result. uk is region 2, usa is region 1, for example. all dvd players can play any dvd at all (how else could they sell the same player in different countries). you need to know how to unlock your player first though to play any dvd, which is perfectly legal. If you know what model your player is, you may find the unlock code from the net, this usually involves clicking on a few buttons on your players remote, which will then let your player run any dvd from any region. try here-<br>  <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks" rel="nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks</a><br>  to find out which version of a movie is the best value for money, check out this website <a href="http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/</a>|`|XFdPpB9Paa	They probably assume that you live in that area as by law they are supposed to ship to the correct area only.<br>  <br>  However if you purchased through their classifieds it would have said which region you were buying and if it didnt and it doesnt work on your area i'd send it back<br>  <br>  region 1 - america/canada<br>  region 2 - europe<br>  region 4 - australia <br>  etc|`|xOiyuDataa	Well, it depends, do you order from the .com one, or the .co.uk?<br>  bare in mind that everyone is from a different region, so the DVD's cater for different countries. When your odering the DVD you have to look at the region it is from. So far I've never had any problems with amazon, and i've ordered loads of DVD's from them....
Gon4vHQjaa	I have never been a fan of Harry Potter. CHARMED ALL THE WAY!!!!! i love charmed..and everything about it....the characters, the plot, the fighting, the action, and the magic...They have really evolved scenes and a awesome story line. It keeps me thinking whats gonna happen next, and its unpredictable. No offense all of you harry potter lovers but i find the books kinda boring...but the movies are great. Still CHARMed!!!!!!!! Harry Potter has great characters. Charmed makes you feel you understand whats going on in these girls lives. I think the actors and actresses are just pure amazing. They know what their doing and they play their parts with passion and they have an astounding plot. The magic is pure and realistic in a way. The show obviously had a lot of work and time put into it and it shows. Harry Potter is great too but I like Charmed Much better. Thats just my opinion. Hope this helped!|`|zMyJOigVaa	Prefer Harry Potter - very clever story lines|`|MnjnkcNEaa	Harry Potter Series of course...I loved all the 4th part(which was just okay)|`|QypSIgq5aa	Charmed!!!  I love those girls, they kick ***!!<br>  <br>  I have never been a fan of Harry Potter.|`|9EiGOJaWaa	Charmed i am not really a big fan of HP|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I have to say Harry Potter was a better series for one all important reason:  The Charmed witches were supposed to follow the Wiccan religion but spent most of it's time turning up it's nose at it.  Any time the sisters encountered a mundane on the wiccan path they did the proverbial pat on the head "oh, that's nice" kind of thing.  At least HP is straight forward with their stories.|`|mg3EaEHMaa	yuck. Neither. But I'll go with Potter, I guess.|`|BJIo6twUaa	I thought Charmed was pretty good and i would probably go with Charmed because they have more shows that are interesting and more in dept with the characters and watching their power evolve and get stronger.<br>  <br>  I like HP movies as well but Charmed does have a lot more stuff going for it because HP movies dont go into details like the books do. I guess it would also depend on if you comparing the TV series with the book or with the movie or both.<br>  <br>  I dont think its a good comparison between limited books/movie of 7, to a tv show than ran for about 5 or 6 season, i dont remember which.<br>  <br>  I like both, but i also like how things evolved more in Charmed with the magic and the character development over the series.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Why are you comparing a TV show to a book/movie series? I never watched Charmed myself. One thing that bugs me about HP is that if you want to really follow magic, those raised in the wizarding world should not be celebrating christian holidays.|`|Wk7oNweGaa	I pick Charmed.  I never really was a fan of the Harry Potter movies..the books were alright though.|`|HD8Cm7PSaa	Harry Potter all the way!!!
4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	I suggest you better try to catch up and learn the keys on the sheet in order to play the music and go for exam. You must know the keys only you can say that you know how to play the piano.|`|AA12376180	Give yourself some time, after all five months is not a very long time. If everyone could sight read and play the piano in five months, everyone would be doing it.<br>  <br>  The ability to sight read is a gift. A person can achieve acceptable levels of competence in reading over time, however some have more talent in this area than others. I always felt I did not get all of the talent that was coming to me.<br>  <br>  Sight reading is not about reading individual notes. A good reader recognizes groupings of notes. All of the technical gymnastics that you practice on the piano i.e. scales, arpeggios, broken chords, etc. help to imprint these patterns and groupings on your brain, so when you see them on the sheet, you do not need to decipher the passage note by note.<br>  <br>  I hope you are taking lessons with a qualified teacher. If so, it will come slowly at first but will get easier as the months go by. Don't try to learn piano on your own. Your progress will be painfully slow and your technical ability will be spotty at best. <br>  <br>  Pay attention to the fingering. It is there for a reason. Try reading lots of music, slowly and hands separately if need be. There is no other way to get it. You need to spend hours and hours at the piano.|`|8kmd1542aa	Tip: Don't go above your level. <br>  I know that it sucks to be a beginner, but trust me, we're all their at one point or another.<br>  Start out with the simply simple stuff - I'm talking 'Twinkle, Twinkle' here, guy. <br>  Just remember, the journey of a pianist begins with a small jingle. Don't ever get frustrated, don't ever get angry, just remember, "I have to do this meaningless child's play just to get to where I want to be."<br>  Beethoven, Haydn, and everyone else started out where you are, fella, and don't work against yourself here.<br>  <br>  Try Alfred's beginner course. They help a lot.|`|cRhkkBAEaa	Get some good books on reading music, and really practice recognizing notes. Try and get some tests as well, so you look at the notes on the staves and have to write down what note it is.<br>  <br>  You can't expect to be able to sight read everything really good after only playing the piano for 5 months - unless you are a musical genius that is lol :) - but practice the pieces you want to learn separate hands reading the music.<br>  <br>  Hope you do well.|`|ziFMYqtoaa	Take it slow, and don't go above your level.

b9wICW1Paa	If it's a Rambo movie, then Rambo, if a Bourne (insert noun) film, then Jason Bourne.<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, I think the edge would go to Rambo.  They are both well trained killers, but Rambo seems to have more combat experience both with or without weapons ("He's trained to be the best - with guns, with knives, with his bare hands")  At least he has gotten out of more sticky situations with his bare hands than has Jason Bourne.  Bourne is perhaps more technically skilled, but Rambo has more experience.|`|ImyKTreiaa	Rambo, because he's 'stronger'... but I wish it was Bourne since he's much easier on the eyes.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Yes, I don't get it either.  Most of us are genetically disposed to be morons.  Not all have lost the caveman gene.  My best guess is it's one group of morons learning a pattern of behavior from a prior generation of morons.  Like they say, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.  Monkey see, monkey do.  But the entire rock and roll pose/devil horns stupidity, totally clichéd, totally played out.  And I never understood how shaking my head around like a seizure victim enhances the listening experience.   <br>  <br>  I know this might sound a tad crazy but I just saw Slipknot a weeks ago and would've rather been able to sit like my dear beloved granny.  However, since the other cavemen around me were standing, blocking the view and acting the fool you have little choice but to conform in order to see the action.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Hahaha, it reminds me of thes Roxette lyrics "Banging on the head drum<br>  Shaking like a mad bull, She's got the look"<br>  <br>  It's fun to rock out, but it kind of scares me when die-hard metal fans rock out.... For example, the other night at the bar, this one dude was singing karaoke to "Master of Puppets" and it was really good until he got inches from my face and screamed while banging his head "MASTER!"|`|69feb1c38fe2bb2c557c2ca3af25447caa	I disagree 100%... Concerts and whatnot are places for Fans to go and enjoy Music and express themselves however way they so desire... I head bang, air guitar, air drum and whatever else appeals too me.. I don't do it because I think i'm cool, and I don't do it seeking attention, I do it because I want too...And i'll continue too, regardless of what other fans think...<br>  <br>  <br>  And if it bothers you so much, might I suggest another form of entertainment?? Like Monster Truck Rallies and such??|`|6mYSbACRaa	You don't understand the metal culture. The sore necks, the beat up faces from the pit. It's how we have fun. Whenever we do it, we just get into it, headbanging to the music. And for the rest of the people who are saying: It's because they're drunk or high. That isn't true. Not saying metalheads don't drink. But it's the music that makes us beat the hell out of each other in the pits, bang our head like insanity patients, that's fun for us. And dude... when you have a tongue like mine (4 inches long) You want people to see that. XD|`|D5QI4eaZaa	Its an adrenaline factor. Some harder music may relate to that one individual that makes them really want to express out. I for one am a punk rocker, not a metal head, so yeah i like to pogo around. Fast Music with beer= good times. Its just a form of enthusiasm. Hope that helps|`|o13ZOCOOaa	You're missing the whole rock experience.<br>  <br>  Getting drunk or high and getting in to the music like that is the only way to properly enjoy it.|`|7bafd319faa1b5da147c395306caa37daa	If the music moves you...mosh.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Mad bull....lawl.<br>  <br>  My thoughts here, ever heard of adrenaline?|`|WfUMOPyhaa	because its fun. I ENJOY BEING AN IDIOT!  do not hate people that do that stuff just because your life is boring, and we are having fun. ..you jealous bastard.|`|t5kcVCvWaa	Its coz we're cool and like to have a gd time|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, let me list some reasons/possibilities:<br>  <br>  1 They are drunk.<br>  2 They are probably listening to heavy metal or something. I am a metal fan, but I don't go crazy. But some people do, because they just get crazy when they listen to it. It's just how much they like the music, I guess.<br>  3 They are moshing. Moshing is a way of "showing your love to a band." Metal fans often mosh at metal concerts. They get into fights, not for the purpose of beating a particular person up, but just to show how much they like heavy metal and the band. It seems a bit strange to me, but who the heck cares?<br>  I started one with my friend at our 8th grade dance while they played AC/DC (not good for moshing, but it was the heaviest song they played all night) Two teachers came in and broke us up after 10 seconds haha.|`|AA11166769	Sometimes the music just moves you. A rock concert is a place to let your hair down and hang loose. Try it some time! You might like it!:)|`|519f86c6bb67a03278f5cb12031d6128aa	We do it because we like the music and we are there to have a good time.  Most of us don't give a rats a§§ what other people think anyway.  If it bothers you that much don't go because expressing yourself at a concert will never end.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Different people express exuberance in different ways.

That being said, if you show us your homework and want some opinions, or if you need help with a particular concept, then I'm sure we will be very happy to help you.  A large number of the TC's here are teachers, and all of us are studied musicians.  And I assure you that in doing this homework yourself you will learn infinitely more than you would had you just relied on us to do it for you.  As a teacher, it would be incredibly ignorant of me to deny you the chance to learn.<br>  <br>  And as Doctor John pointed out.  This is probably for a music appreciation class, where as most of us studied music for years of our life.  It would be fairly obvious to your teacher if you came in to class with answers that were given to you by us.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Do your own homework.

That just sends me.  It's weird but if she sounds like a pull-string toy when she talks she has my attention...<br>  <br>  --Shiny.  ^_^  Let's just put it this way: I was born in 1966.  My mother had seven sisters.  I got to see a *lot* of my aunts wearing old-school clothes including nylons.  And...I grew up, was a teenager to young adult, in the 1980s.  Meaning, yes, one of my kid sisters was *deeply, madly* into the Valley Girl thing.  You know, the style that among other things features lots of leggings and tights?<br>  <br>  To say I had exposure to *shiny* as a younger person would be a gross understatement.  ^_^<br>  <br>  --And....if you know anything about your fashions from the above time periods...well, yeah, hair that's rather *done up* gets my attention.  o_o  Not so much specific styles--just seeing hair that doesn't *act like* hair, if you know what I mean.  That's almost too styled and structured.<br>  <br>  Ok, I'll stop now, I see folks ready to throw veggies at me.

27sSI5wxaa	I've lost all respect for Chris and I won't be using my hard-earned money to buy any more of his music.<br>  <br>  What kind of a man bites a woman?<br>  <br>  If a man gets that angry, then he needs to be confined.|`|ogLHkR0oaa	He was probably pushed too far !|`|EQdDkSw0aa	I'ts wrong...i mean if a female excuses for what he has done..they will make it look cool for allot of other guyz to do it!<br>  I think people should ignore him and stop buying his music.....<br>  I mean yh these things happen but he has to be taught a lesson  :-(|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	A man should never hit a woman end of story|`|H4rEZ0rCaa	I never liked him before either. And yes, I think he should go to jail!|`|hmsCFQocaa	I think of Chris Brown after the beating the same as before the beating.<br>  <br>  Simply put, I never liked him.<br>  <br>  I don't know why beautiful starlets embrace thugs.|`|8PmgWto5aa	He allegedy assaulted her. Was this proven true? I don't know but everyone makes mistakes and I'm sure Chris Brown lost his temper and he is bigger than Rihanna is he is probably more likely to hurt her unconsciously. I'm sure Chris has his regretts but what's done is done. I still like him as a artist and his music and probably will so in the future. Music lives on and on forever.|`|QCVzUC1baa	I think its awful but to be fair we dont know the full true story!|`|AA11601031	You "love him"?  I don't understand this attraction to guys who beat women up.  Are you ready to write him and tell him that you're available to serve as his punching bag if he's finally done whacking the crap out of Rhianna?<br>  Amazing.<br>  <br>  I think he should do the time.  If she gave him herpes, he should sue her for money damages in civil court - not whack her like that.|`|UTgz8yNnaa	I THINK CHRIS BROWN WAS WRONG FOR WHAT HE DID BUT I LOVE HIM AND HE IS MY IDLE.  I DONT THINK HE SHOULD GO TO JAIL B/C HE IS A HUMAN AND HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES.  I AM DISSAPOINTED IN HIM B/C HE HIT HER BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER I STILL LOVE HIM!!!!PLUS HE IS HOT|`|2d3d0e4d8b7d204f3953a8fd5694f1b1aa	Well, he beat up a woman so yes, he should go to prison!  How anyone could beat up a woman I will never know...especially one of the most beautiful women in the world!|`|SZzASlujaa	I could care less. I still feel the same about his music, I'll still record his live performances, and I'll still buy his music. C Breezy is just a person, he wasn't perfect to begin with.|`|Ux1xMyxvaa	it serves rihanna right in my opinion. i dont like the girl. shes annoying and cannot sing.|`|doeg7JSaaa	It's happened just move on. There must be more important issues to worry about.|`|qTuAgAy2aa	i think he should go to prison, abuse isnt something that should be taken lightly. So many women are abused by their husband/partners each day and anyone cruel enough to do it to the person they "love" needs to go to jail. The only reason people would say he should be let off easy is because he is a good singer, which he is (he's very talented), but if this was someone other than chris brown would they be let off easy? I dont like that abuse is something that happens all the time and people are only worried when it happens to someone like rhianna. that is not right.|`|iSejBxZJaa	I hate him!<br>  <br>  HE DESERVES THE ELECTRIC CHAIR!!<br>  <br>  my poor rihanna :( x|`|iiRbOAQnaa	So if Chris Brown beat up your mother, would it be punishment enough that a few people just didn't like  him anymore? Does that really make sense? Why should he be absolved of responsibility just because you like his songs? <br>  <br>  No one really knows what happened, so I don't think he should be punished for rumors. But if he really physically assaulted a woman, he should be punished by the law.|`|xUDgtIcjaa	Personally, i did used to like him, kinda still do, but yeah their was some jealousy between the pair and obviously he took it too far i mean to hit a woman is not right, so therefore he shouldnt have done it.. but he has paid $50,000 bail for it and served a night in prison.. so i dunno.|`|IeHd8IU8aa	if i hear umbarelllla one more time i will bail him out|`|uJ2U0PM5aa	I always thought him as sweet, down-to-earth and a genuine person.... but after what he has done to Rihanna i can't even listen to his music. Even if it wasn't Rihanna he bet up and just some random woman my opinion would still be this ; any guy who raises a hand to a girl is a nasty piece of work!|`|0e4xc29Laa	I think he should go to prison and ROT there! The picture (below) shows what horrors he's done to Rihanna, and you think just because "some people don't like him anymore" he's paid the price?!<br>  <br>  What is wrong with you? What he did to Rihanna is NOT forgivable, and I hope he goes to prison for a looonnggg time. Disgusting.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	word is that she usually starts fights with him anyways...some guys can ignore but not everyone is..sometimes you get pushed to a point..if it was ongoing i would sympathise but you cant keep hitting a guy ever so often and not expect a reaction sometime..like chris case, once u keep it in too long eventually you gonna explode|`|GEOuOFvNaa	I really like them both so it's difficult knowing that one of them did something wrong. It's like I don't want to believe it but I mean it happened so I guess he should pay the price like a normal person would pay. Have they come out with the whole truth about it already?|`|LLNlyaFaaa	well i still like Chris Brown but i don't like what he did i mean i'm pretty sure it wouldn't happen again although it could and i don't think Rihanna is going to give him another chance too bad though they were great together!!|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	what the **** do you mean he paid the price??? he did not and he should go to jail for a long time because there is no excuse for a man to attack another woman in such a feral rage.<br>  <br>  he couldnt sing anyway....|`|Q7PXuNleaa	yes he was drunk and hes not 21 yet thats illegal <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220082741AAsdXCv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Xg3iry5qaa	the punishment should fit the crime...just like everyone else.  <br>  <br>  What kind of a MAN hits a women?  Really. Hes lost all respect.|`|pz09LoOyaa	Why should the law be changed just because he is famous? An ordinary person would have too.  They are milking the story a bit though.|`|siTEupHMaa	lock him up, even if its just for a few weeks.......no man should get away with beating a woman, and judging by the photo it definetly was "a beating"|`|jsgKGtdBaa	let the story die. Im past caring. my dad hits me, i don't see anyone that gives a sh*t.|`|i9oUoc17aa	did he deffo do it?|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	I think that he should be treated the same as any other citizen, whether that means prison or not i dont know but he shouldnt be let off because hes a star and people don't like him anymore. I don't believe that to be a suitable punishment.|`|8ZGmo5YIaa	I never was a fan of Chris Brown, he was alright. Now I don't like him too much. Guys that hit women I don't like them. No guy should hit a woman. I think Chris Brown should go to jail for at least 6 months. That's my opinion.|`|VHxA2TIHaa	i luved him like crazy then my friends told me about it and i didn't believe them. then i googled it and loads of stories came up so now i don't listen to his music, stare at his pictures or anything....<br>  <br>  i miss him... lol|`|YjLBtm92aa	Well... firstly why did he do that to rihanna? what did she do to him??? and yes i saw the pic it was HORRIFIC poor girl. and yeah he DEFINATLY deserves a prison sentance at least 4 years!!|`|NLRo8bfEaa	I think he is a bit idiotic but i still think he's ok.

Ad my earliest ad memory is the ones about peas, there was young girl and she would make the pea popping sound wih her finger and mouth.  =D|`|bhm3Z5zoaa	My fave advert at the moment: The barclaycard one with the waterslide. "Just let your love flow....la..la.la...la...la...la..." I wish I had a slide like that...*pine away*    My earliest advert memory: "For MASH use SMASH!" That one with the aliens watching the people cut potatoes and laughing while they use Smash potato mash powder. It still cracks me up now.... harharhar.

wOc4Dqllaa	I'm wearing my Nirvana tee (same as your avatar!) and a big lumberjack shirt today for him... I actually haven't heard a single Nirvana song today, though, I've been listening to John Prine all day 'cause I'm seeing him tonight :D<br>  <br>  My favorite Nirvana song's their unplugged cover of Where Did You Sleep Last Night, my favorite original song changes alot but is currently Sliver.<br>  <br>  My favorite album's Unplugged, favorite studio album is Bleach.|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	well, I have school off today, was supposed to be for a teacher training or something,but I think it was to celebrate Kurt's birthday. My favorite Nirvana song is Something In The Way. My favorite Nirvana album is In Utero or Bleach.<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday, Kurt|`|x3vhAFMyaa	I told my Mom she got really excited about it. <br>  <br>  song- Smells Like Teen Spirit<br>  album- Nevermind|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	No. Nirvana's not that great of a band for me to worship a member.<br>  Breed.<br>  Nevermind.|`|Z5VCTFruaa	I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing!<br>  I'll learn how to play Come As You Are on guitar. :)<br>  or Lithium... <br>  or Both!|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Not right now but I'm gonna listen to alot of Nirvana later.<br>  My favorite song by them is Breed, though all of them are awesome.<br>  My favorite album by them is Nevermind, even though I like the sound of In Utero better. Does that make since?|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Song: 'On a Plain' (Honorable Mentions: Scentless Apprentice, Drain You, Polly, Lithium, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle, School, Very Ape, and many many more)<br>  <br>  Album: In Utero|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I like Nirvana, But I never really got REALLY in to them.<br>  <br>  Umm... I'll probably go to the bar tonight, so ill drink to Kurt. :)<br>  Favorite songs, Come as You Are, Lithium, About a Girl, Polly<br>  <br>  <br>  That first guy's just an ****hole|`|SyoBirYDaa	I'm wearing my Nirvana shirt to celebrate :)<br>  Favorite song; Negative Creep :)<br>  Favorite Album: Bleach or Nevermind|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I wore my Nirvana shirt and I'm going to listen to a lot of Nirvana tonight.<br>  <br>  song: "Milk It"<br>  album: "In Utero"|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Happy Birthday Kurt :)<br>  <br>  Agreed, by the way, its much better to celebrate his life.|`|k4GqiB6taa	1rst question:I listened to 10 songs by him today,that might count.<br>  2nd Q:Scentless Apprentice<br>  Bleach|`|89xzNpVaaa	I listened to Nirvana the whole day, what more could i do?<br>  More than that would be silly, the main point is that you remember him, and he is always in my mind everyday(every morning i wake up, i make sure there is any Nirvana song played right when im out of bed)  , so why not today?<br>  I do not have a "favourite" Nirvana song nor an album, i l just love them, everything of them. But, though, "Milk it" is my most played.<br>  Yes, its better to celebrate  his life than dwelling on dying. <br>  Lets not care about who killed him or whatever related to how he died, its was destined to be like this. And<br>  Lets all remember him with his music, just how he touched us. and all say R.I.P|`|JBUAFV49aa	About a girl.<br>  (:<br>  <br>  Long Live Kurt.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yeah, happy birthday Kurt!  I actually wonder what Frances Bean and Courtney are doing today, what they're saying. <br>  <br>  Kurt being the best lyricist ever in my opinion, i'll always guess at what his next songs would've been about and sounded like; something original i know. He was gorgeous (those eyes), and i can't help wishing he hadn't died, even if it was probably inevitable. <br>  <br>  I'm watching MTV unplugged later, his voice was so unique and emotional it makes my spine shiver. <br>  Favorite song: Changes all the time, but Lithium is probably my all time fav.<br>  Favorite album: Um, can never decide between Nevermind and In Utero.... Both too good.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	thank you much for reminding me, i didn't even REALIZE what day it was!<br>  <br>  and to commemorate his life, since you just reminded me, i think i am going to go to the local youth center with my friends and blast nirvana tunes while we gawk at copies of his journals. haha<br>  <br>  my favorite song by them changes weekly. the song that made me love them was "lithium", however<br>  <br>  i love them all! how about "greatest hits" because it's got a little of everything hahahahah<br>  <br>  btw, since you are a nirvana fan, you rule.|`|E6SKwIjbaa	Yes, me and bunch of friends are celebrating Kurts birthday, by listening to Nirvana, wearing flannels and Converse, the Kurt Cobain Converse, were just bringing grunge into our school, I'm also planning to throw cakes at friends and scream...<br>  <br>  Favorite Nirvana Song, Milk It or Plateau (Meat Puppets Cover) or Polly (NEW WAVE)<br>  <br>  favorite Album: MTV Unplugged, or Bleach....<br>  <br>  HAPPY BIRTHDAY KURT!!!<br>  "Were The Big Sell Out Band, NIRVANA"<br>              -Kurt Cobain|`|AA11039335	15 years - weird isn't it? :O<br>  <br>  Are you doing anything to commemorate his life, today?<br>    No - Despite Nirvana being on of my favourite bands, I find the whole concept of commemorating someone who you didn't know [no matter how much they influence/affect you] is kind of stupid and pointless.<br>  HOWEVER, this question particularly made me want to pull out Nevermind, haven't listened in a while. :)<br>  <br>  What is your favorite Nirvana song? <br>   Aaaah, I cannot pick merely one! D: Aneurysm, Heart-Shaped Box, Verse Chorus Verse, Lounge Act, I Hate Myself..., Dumb, MV, About A Girl, etc.<br>    <br>  Favorite Nirvana album?

NVss4zf7aa	They are ok, but not legends in my book. I believe most of their fame came from their deaths.|`|jhMkBqk7aa	I don't think they are garbage per say, they were still better than Lil Wayne but I think they are WAY overrated. I have been saying for years that they were only LEGENDS because they died and in the whole scheme of things Rakim is the most influential rapper of them all and a real legend.  50 cent does not have the lyrical talent what so ever to be called a legend.  Of the top of my head I can name 15 rappers still alive better than Tupac and especially better than Biggie.  Lupe Fiasco, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Elzhi, Black Thought, Common, Rakim, MF DOOM, Nas, KRS-ONE, Blu, Andre 3000, Eminem, Royce Da 5'9, Pharoah Monch.  In my opinion Tupac is the better of the two, I was flipping through channels the other day and came across Tupac: Resurrection, he was a lot more intelligent and eclectic then I thought.|`|htwyOFMmaa	yeah i wud say that. cuz to tell u tha truth there were people back then that cud rap WAY betta than them. i personally think that Pac was better than Biggie jus because when he started he talked bout real stuff. <br>  You kno wat really irrates me, when people do remixes or put Pac and Biggies voices to songs. Like that new Keyshia Cole song OMG i cant stand thatsong even though Keyshia my gurl|`|wfZhkZO0aa	TuPac and Biggie are legends for a lot of reasons, not solely because of their music.  They brought a lot into the game, but neither one of them was a GOAT.  They were just two talented dudes living on opposite coasts, beefin constantly.

lgMshdofaa	I went to a Starfield concert....t-shirt and jeans..even though it was inside, it got really hot,...so just dont wear a long-sleve|`|67PMeHfNaa	When you go to a gig, there's never any point getting dressed up. You're in a room with a load of sweaty people, dancing around - so heels are a definite no no. I think the best idea is to wear jeans and a pair of nice pumps or even converse. And a nice top, it can be quite dressy to glam up your outfit or it can be simple and understed (as the gig is in the dark people aren't going to be looking at your outfit anyway!) Just generally wear whatever you feel most comfortable in, without being overly dressy.|`|UU3AAlkraa	Body paint... Nuff said  LOL

u8hsZ7claa	Aesop Rock<br>  <br>  Listening to him makes me feel as if there is nothing wrong with having coffee and enjoying a good book, that isn't 40% illustrations. I believe he creates music for those that think and behave outside the "box" <br>  <br>  Examples of best work: Daylight, Float, Food Clothes & Medicine, Winner Takes All|`|EXXMO4sVaa	Ahh I like too many. I will try and cut down this list as much as I can...  :)<br>  <br>  The Game- He has a good voice and makes good tunes :)<br>  Eminem- He speaks the truth, and that scares most people, that's why so many people are haters, cos they're scared of the truth.<br>  Lil Wayne- Got that original voice going on and that song Something You Forgot shows his other sides of being a rapper.<br>  <br>  I have loads more... love Rap music and RnB, but this is my shortlist lol  :)|`|NctYwdvhaa	Kanye West because of College Dropout, and his diverse subject matter, his slow but good flow, meaningful lyrics and good production. i dont care what people say about him, and i dont give a f*ck if i get thumbs down, cause he says what he feels, and he is his own person.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Kweli...<br>  <br>  It's really his multi thematic albums, the songs that really transformed Kweli from just a playlist rapper to my favorite are as follows:<br>  <br>  Theives In The Night<br>  Name Of The Game<br>  Holy Moly<br>  The Proud<br>  Where Do We Go<br>  Black Girl Pain<br>  For Women<br>  Soul Music<br>  and Good To You|`|9wUrbqT3aa	NaS <br>  <br>  - Rewind & One Love - His creativity & ability to tell a story like no one else<br>  - Black Girl Lost - Comments on actually issues in the community.  He doesn't constantly glorify the gang-bangin - drug dealin topics<br>  <br>  - Also the Illmatic album|`|d2j1cAASaa	Papoose because I like every single one of his songs. Especially Alpabetical Slaughter.|`|uK3erCEOaa	Everlast...|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Talib kweli<br>  Jean Grae<br>  <br>  Becaue they spit true poetry and refuse to dumb it down or play to the masses|`|jhMkBqk7aa	My favorite rapper is a tie between Talib Kweli, because of he has the most introspective view of our society: see "Thieves in the Night.", Mos Def because he has such a cool personality, has great flow, part of one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time, can act, and made "Mathematics", Lupe Fiasco because his structure is so complex and his use of metaphors is fantastic, he also refrains from rapping about stupid **** and is above being corrupted by "The Game", and finally Elzhi from Slum Village because he brings the heat, has been making quality hits since he was 18, he is very creative, and underground.  See "The Big F.U.", "Fire", "Thats that One", "Where it all Begins", "Motown 25" and "Boomerang" for more information, you won't regret it.|`|9OgvNZiLaa	Talib Kweli - "Hot Thing"  and "Listen."<br>  He a true lyricist. A true poet.  He aint talkin bout females, sex, and drugs in most a his songs. He talkin bout real, genuine stuff.|`|hfxRFSM4aa	SPM. if u a young mexican u can relate to his younger years from racist police to smoking weed. i have to say his best album would be a tie, never change and reveille park|`|MRtX1L2faa	WEEZY !!!!|`|eUtCi0Ivaa	T.I...he's amazing, and the best alive i think.<br>  some of his bests:<br>  Ready For Whatever<br>  No Matter What<br>  Im Illy<br>  <br>  pretty much the whole paper trail album.|`|sSbyzyuGaa	KaNyE WeST!!|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I'm in transition.

I'm liking alot of folks right now.|`|zVdNQowNaa	Jay-Z - The Black Album/Reasonable Doubt. Sick wordplay, fluent and smooth flow, true lyrics and he's got the game on lock.<br>  <br>  Lil' Wayne - Tha Block Is Hot/500 Degreez. Sick metaphors and similies, unique voice and delivery, great beats and speaks the truth.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Chuck D. I keep telling you why. Nation of Millions, Fear of a Black Planet and the very underrated Apocalypse 91 are the best PE albums imo. <br>  Also check out Revolverlution and How You Sell Soul.<br>  <br>  Cap, don't make me come up there.|`|AA10731562	Lil Wayne - His Albums, Changes Pop songs to rap for a while ex. Unstopppable, Nice metaphors, Nice Simile, Nice flow, his voice, raps the truth, and HE IS THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I can't say I have an overwhelming favorite. <br>  I've loved Twista for awhile though.

I don't honestly believe JAGGED LITTLE PILL is the masterpiece many crits make it out to be.<br>  Pearl Jam- Good but a bit overrated.<br>  Poison- They're a hack glam metal band. Overrated.<br>  James Blunt- HUGELY overrated.<br>  Elvis Costello- Mostly underrated., I've only heard one album thus far (JULIET LETTERS) from him I'd honestly rate "bad", others have all been good to great.<br>  Dixie Chicks- Overrated by liberal music critics because of the whole "We're ashamed Bush is from Texas" backlash and their retort album but genuinely talented. Liked them before, still like them after. FLY is still their best album.<br>  The Kinks- Underrated, in the U.S. at least.

The reason you wouldn't want to do it is not because doing it is wrong, but because if your s/o found out it would be over between you. Sex is awesome and feels great! I love my wife more than anything in this world and there is no circumstance in the REAL world that would bring me to cheat on her. But the fact is if it were MAGIC and there were no chance of your beloved finding out and you had the opportunity to have sex with your #1 crush, hottest babe, ultimate ideal or whatever, you totally would, and so would anyone else. <br>  <br>  It's like if you found a one hundred dollar bill just sitting in the middle of the street, would you keep it? Hell yes you would! I mean, common decency dictates that you try to find the owner, but how do you intend to do that? Spend your own hard earned money to take out an ad in the paper? "Found: Hundred dollar bill. Every money grubbing idiot in the world, please phone me for details." But if you SEE a person dropping that same bill, of course you'll try to give it back. But deep down, every single one of us secretly hopes that there's no one around to claim that bill other than you. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that people's intentions are not good, but in your scenario you propose that a magical entity offers you an absolutel infallible mulligan to sleep with anyone you desire. You bet you're going to take that opportunity. If anyone tells you otherwise, be sure you don't drop any hundred dollar bills around them.|`|AA11199881	No I wouldn't because if you do love someone and you had no issues in the relationship you wouldn't be tempted to cheat in the first place.<br>  <br>  So the guilt would be too much for me personally|`|OKKfyLnlaa	naw, I wouldn't be able to pull it off.  I would feel way too guilty, tempted, but guilty.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	NO WAY!!!|`|4gZYucHMaa	No I wouldn't...if I wanted to cheat I wouldn't of married I'd of stayed single.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	my guilt would eat me up,,i don't think i could,,i wouldn't want my love to cheat on me and not know it,,nope i cant,,|`|a4LWildhaa	Wouldn't do it because I was raised to not take advantage of anyone by cheating. Guilt has nothing to do with it. What goes around comes around, dude.|`|NKuQh4sSaa	No I would never cheat full stop.|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	i would never want to cheat on a loved one.|`|AA10838250	no thank you , i would pass|`|dd7f6eb566c0d6a7067106dd5cbbc4e3aa	well since i am single i would not mind doing that but only if the person that i wanted was single i wouldn't want to mess up his relationship but if i was in a committed relationship with someone than no i would not do it|`|m9tWBMBJaa	yeah because my bff is going out with the guy i like...<br>  sorry i prob. wont have alot of guilt  because the girl knew i liked him and promised not to go out with him for my sake and look where we are now...|`|4EZcG3YSaa	I'd pretend to the genie that I was married, take him up on his generous offer then admit to being single all along *ha ha pulls tongues at genie*|`|Qih2hKqkaa	No, cheating effects the cheater as well as the person who gets cheated on!|`|AA11540629	I would take the offer|`|eXDepNHZaa	naaaah karmas a beeeeeeeech yo!! and i have a guilty concience.

Maybe it's just not my style.<br>  <br>  As for Guns N Roses, I couldn't stand Chinese Democracy but they where a great band back in the 80s. I'm actually listening to "My Michelle" right now.<br>  <br>  So I definitely pick Guns N Roses. Even though I don't like U2 I don't think they're a bad band by any stretch of the imagination, just not for me. But I still think Guns N Roses is overall better and I definitely like them more.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	I prefer the single song 'Sweet child o mine' over any U2 songs, simply because i really like the sound of the guitar riffs (nothing in the lyrics lol). However, judging GnR and U2 overall as bands, including every song, i prefer U2. Their music sounds more thoughtful, as someone's already said. =D|`|828d07c83a9f68d1c1b9e891350c6802aa	GUNS for sure!!!!!! Look i dont know what it is people see in u2, they suck. Bono is an idiot, who cares about all of the causes he proclaims to promote. All he is really doing is secretly adding to his bank account, by showing up to causes that his manager says will be good for business.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	GNR <br>  <br>  'cause they kick U2's *** Hell YEAH!!!! XD<br>  <br>  Go on, TD me!! TD me for my opinion, right now!!!!!|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Both are kind of hit and miss for me, but I think at it's core I think U2 is more balanced and more interesting to me. GNR is good in it's niche, but as much as I like a few songs it's a niche that doesn't do a ton for me on the whole.|`|NC67WVlEaa	U2<br>  <br>  I think, they seem like they put more thought into their songs and Axl just rubs me the wrong way so, I'm not a GNR fan.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	The original Guns N Roses... I just think U2 is Laaammmmeeee!|`|CfWXgwxBaa	Guns N Roses.Slash isn`t in U2,you know,that`s what make all the difference for me.I respect U2 though....|`|yS61H04haa	Old GNR <br>  <br>  I never got into U2. They have maybe 2 songs I actually love though.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	G'N'R.  I like their music better even though I resent the fact that Axl and his over-sized ego killed that band.<br>  <br>  U2 did a lot of good songs too, but I never cared much for Bono's politics.  His charitable work in Africa was good, but the politics, not so much.<br>  <br>  Musically, I preferred G'N'R.  But in terms of personalities, both bands have members that have their own personal flaws.  It is a shame that G 'N' R didn't leverage their success with Appetite for Destruction into a long successful 15 - 20 year career, but instead slipped into that too large category of bands that had an awesome debut album, but then never really re-captured the magic after that (along with Pearl jam, Van Halen, Boston, Foreigner, Quiet Riot, etc..............)|`|qOmtO6dYaa	Guns N Roses for me <br>  <br>  I like both but listen to more GNR than U2|`|mJgAZTTyaa	guns and roses. u2 has more musical talent, but bono just takes away from that. Not that hes not talented, cuz he really is, just because he thinks hes the ****. he also thinks that his music is making the world a better place, and unless his music finds a cure for cancer or aids its not doing much good.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Guns N Roses<br>  <br>  They are heavy, U2 are not.|`|z5utsGKCaa	U2 been going longer and better songs|`|dFacbjIZaa	U2, by a lot. better band, better songs, better albums, far more talented Guitarist.<br>  <br>  Puhleeeeeze, like Bono is more of a wanker than Axl. Yeah right.<br>  <br>  Axl is a bigger Idiot, He did the best job of ruining a great band and screwing over His fans than any prima donna rock star I've ever seen.|`|qRM0r7eVaa	Guns N Roses..all the way.<br>  U2 suck!|`|7bafd319faa1b5da147c395306caa37daa	GNR...Why..."Appetite for Destruction"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GlfSvBEq9Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GlfSvBEq...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9O82ydYL_c&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9O82ydYL...</a>|`|YPCFzVMfaa	guns and roses cause u2 suck....soz u2 lovers|`|a20KcBqdaa	U2 definitely. i love 'still havent found what i'm looking for' 'angel of harlem' and 'with or without you'  awesome songs, awesome band.|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	Guns and Roses<br>  as the lead singers voice is extremely unique and their entire band fits the profile of what I think is an awesome band!<br>  <br>  And plus Slash is in it.<br>  like goooddddddd..|`|gYWDrHVFaa	U2!  They still can rock it out and aren't washed up.|`|J36FKvkHaa	Uh, Guns n Roses, I guess. I'm not really a huge fan, but I really can't stand U2. Sorry.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Apples to Oranges.|`|PNxk3aR6aa	:/|`|H1mGTwvWaa	both had real big albums.<br>  <br>  guns and roses-appetite for destruction<br>  u2-joshua tree<br>  <br>  in saying that, i like both bands. u-2 proved they can stand the test of time which guns and roses couldnt (thanks axel). i realy think u-2 is the led zeppelin of the 70's meaning they will in the next few decades still be talked about like the pink floyds (my favorite band) etc. in 40 years i dont think many will remember guns and roses and thats a shame, because when together as a band they made great music..|`|3q8LkLLDaa	both awesome|`|PDCVyN5eaa	i love guns and roses i grew up on them but i like both|`|psvPoJHKaa	Guns N Roses<br>  <br>  I think their songs are so powerful and amazing. I also like U2 a lot, especially with or without you. :D|`|IAKbseRMaa	I would have to say Guns N Roses becasue they put a lot more meaning and soul into thier songs. Although U2 is good as well.|`|XSzH73Wyaa	U2 Definitely <br>  <br>  They're Still So Amazing And So Relevant<br>  <br>  I Also Love How Bono's Such A Philanthropist|`|xXVPKs6paa	They're both good but Iprefer guns N Roses because Slash is one of my biggest influences in my guitar playing.|`|10f1bd172f295afc17dd0f44aa1bd8a3aa	U2 of course, they are just the best in the world. G n' R are ok but not a patch on bono and the boys.|`|7nkQyM0Laa	I am a metaller but I much prefer U2|`|ms6OfdLDaa	guns n roses|`|YZxc3SnSaa	The Guns !<br>  They have stayed away & come back with something different .<br>  Unlike U2 who have trudged through to enhance their selves.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Guns N Roses. Bono is WAY too egotistical for me, and I get tired of his whining (music), and his numerous causes. Show me real receipts that he himself has donated millions out of pocket to these same causes and I may think he's halfway human. He sure thinks he's the $hit, doesn't he?|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Guns N' Roses. One of teh first hafrd rock.metal bands I got into.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	U2. Its classic stuff that is timeless. <br>  GnR to me is nostalgic and kinda of comedic. <br>  But don't get me wrong I enjoy both but I don't generally think to go out and buy GnR or even put them on at home.|`|Z5VCTFruaa	I haven't really listened to Guns N Roses but I'm gonna have to go with Guns N Roses!!<br>  lol I'm not so fond of U2|`|9f15OV0Naa	U2 baby!
I0B7oAfOaa	A blond from California decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blond begins to slip from the saddle.<br>  <br>  In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly oblivious to its slipping rider. Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup, she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground over and over. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness when to her great fortune . . . the Supermarket manager sees her and shuts the horse off.|`|A3JXtewuaa	Kids.. heh... what can ya do?<br>  <br>  " While in line at the bank one afternoon, <br>  my toddler decided to release <br>  some pent-up energy and ran amok. <br>  I was finally able to grab hold of <br>  her after receiving looks of disgust <br>  and annoyance from other patrons. <br>  I told her that if she did not start behaving <br>  "right now" she would be punished. <br>  To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening, <br>  "If you don't let me go right now, <br>  I will tell Grandma that I saw you <br>  kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!" <br>  The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. <br>  Even the tellers stopped what they were doing. <br>  I mustered up the last of my dignity and <br>  walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. <br>  The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me, were screams of laughter. "|`|SKW8awPsaa	a man picked up a big ice piece and said from where it is leaking?<br>  lol<br>  one more joke<br>  did u know an old woman died in her childhood!<br>  lol|`|6aQY1TTLaa	yo mama so big she fell on the ground<br>  i didnt laugh but the floor cracked up|`|Rodj52Swaa	Yo mama so stupid, she tried to wake up a sleeping bag.
uUzbqGh5aa	I agree Lucy, I'm a big fan of Lily/CK and l think it would be cruel to have her face disfigured when there are so many darn ugly people on the show they could get rid of instead of beautiful Lily.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I heard a spoiler on here that she does get into some kind of accident and it does damage her face.  Rumor is she may be replaced with another actress.|`|mIUjnujeaa	She is going to get into an accident and be disfigured I figure they are going to switch her for another actress kind of like they did with Todd on OLTL he was scarred and then dissappeared for a while came back with a new face and played it off as he had reconstructive surgery to change his face so he could see his kids again.|`|75zggy81aa	i cant stand lily- maybe if she gets in an accident she will have a more interesting storyline so i can like her.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Oh, I know! I like Lily, so sad.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Too bad it wont be Cane thats disfigured he's becoming strange|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	Sorry..... but I really dont like the character of Lily, but Im thinking that if they have another actress in her spot I might actually like her character, I did hear  that this Lily was leaving...I hope so|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	oh great...I like lily too but she should have stayed in school.  if one of the poster mentioned that she has damage to her face and possibly be replaced, who will be the new lily>|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I heard she was going to have something happen to her face.|`|4kuWOZowaa	OH gosh lily is suppose to get in a accident..they just wont give lily a break huh|`|rebWUfLzaa	what are you talking about? she was fine on the show yesterday. Is she leaving or something?
eHyJ9mYFaa	That is not a nice thing at all to say about someone.  I can't stand the way they brought her back on and she was so smart and took care of Mrs. C. then they turn around and make her an airhead.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	LOL, yeah its pretty noticeable...I like Ester but she makes stupid decisions.  She frustrates me sometimes!|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I am an Esther fan...and I am so glad that she has a bigger part in the show.  But I ABSOLUTLEY agree with you!  All I see is teethe...teethe....TEETHE!  It drives me crazy!|`|eDAg5OnTaa	OMG! Thak you for this laugh. I really needed it today.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	i think she is a very sweet woman but sometimes I think she can be a bit airheadish, not realized the father of her own daughters baby, and marrying and a man that she barley even know.|`|rebWUfLzaa	I just said this to my son a few days ago.  lol.  <br>  I think its all the 'glam' they got her on. doesn't fit her. too much make up.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I like Esther too, but i did notice since you said something. When she smiles.|`|2uZRYZ1Naa	omg! thats what i thought! but she is very nice...|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Thing is she has "big teeth" company on the show in Victoria and Amber and to some extent Colleen!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Hahahaha!!   That's hilarious.  Ya never know!<br>  <br>  Did you know that she was originally hired to do a one-day part as the maid?  She was and still is an airline attendant in real life.  She seems like a really cool person - she's always at the events - I see her pictures.  And she got a star on the walk of fame - there was a pic of her sitting by it - holding a feather duster - hysterical!<br>  <br>  P.S.  I got this info straight from the horse's mouth!!   lol

Hopefully these become new treasured songs for you:<br>  <br>  The Beach Boys "Til I Die" - This song is COMPLETELY different from their usual "sun and fun, cars and girls" stereotype. Off their SURF'S UP album (which is also NOT about surfing.)<br>  <br>  Elvis Costello and Jimmy Cliff "Seven Day Weekend" - This one is a cover of an obscure Gary "U.S." Bonds song that not very many people know because it's only on the soundtrack to an 80s Robin Williams movie. ("Club Paradise" if you care) One of the best "can't wait until the frickin' work week is OVER!" songs there is.<br>  <br>  LCD Soundsystem "North American Scum" - This one's from last year but unless you're an indie hound, you probably don't know it.<br>  <br>  Black Box Recorder "The Facts of Life" - From 2000. <br>  <br>  Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue "Where the Wild Roses Grow" - No, this isn't anything like that ditzy "Can't Get You Out of my Head" song she sang a couple years back. Wonderfully unique and spooky. Beautiful and DARK. Great song.<br>  <br>  L.L. Cool J "Cheesy Rat Blues" - Funny, clever album track about the dark side of trying to "come back hard" in the rap game. Early 90s.<br>  <br>  Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians "Nothing" - Everyone only knows that "What I Am" song but this is one of many gems from that same album SHOOTING RUBBERBANDS AT THE STARS.<br>  <br>  Paul Simon "The Obvious Child" - Almost impossible to listen to this and not want to move something. One of the coolest drum tracks/rhythm patterns ever.<br>  <br>  Frank Sinatra "I've Got the World on a String" - The epitome of cool. One of my favorites from him.<br>  <br>  Miley Cyrus...LOL..just making sure you're still paying attention...<br>  <br>  My actual last pick:<br>  <br>  XTC "Senses Working Overtime" - Underappreciated English alt-pop band with their origins in the late 70s. Best work in the mid-late 80s in my opinion.|`|J36FKvkHaa	Against Me! - "Sink, Florida, Sink," "Those Anarcho Punx are So Mysterious"<br>  The Alternate Routes - "Endless Conversation"<br>  The Anniversary - "Perfectly"<br>  Azure Ray - "November"<br>  Babyshambles - "**** Forever," "Pipedown"<br>  Balkan Beat Box - "Bulgarian Chicks," "Hermetico"<br>  Bat for Lashes - "The Wizard," "What's a Girl to Do?"<br>  The Bats - "Courage"<br>  Beirut - "Elephant Gun"<br>  Birdmonster - "Iditarod"<br>  The Birthday Massacre - "Blue"<br>  The Black Ghosts - "Anyway You Choose to Give It," "I Want Nothing"<br>  Black Lips - "Veni Vidi Vici"<br>  Blitzen Trapper - "Furr"<br>  Bloc Party - "This Modern Love," "Pioneers"<br>  BOTAR - "They Provide the Paint for the Picture-Perfect Masterpiece You Will Paint on the Inside of Your Eyelids"<br>  Bon Iver - "Re:Stacks"<br>  The Breeders - "Cannonball"<br>  Bright Eyes - "Lover I Don't Have to Love," "Lua," "The Center of the World," "The Calendar Hung Itself," "Hit the Switch"<br>  Cake - "Long Line of Cars"<br>  Chairlift - "Bruises"<br>  Charlotte Sometimes - "In Your Apartment"<br>  The Chills - "Pink Frost"<br>  The Chop - "Out Dancing"<br>  The Clash - "Straight to Hell"<br>  The Cloud Room - "Hey Now Now"<br>  Company of Thieves - "Oscar Wilde"<br>  The Cranberries - "Zombie"<br>  Creedence Clearwater Revival - <br>  Creeper Lagoon - "Here We Are"<br>  CSS - "Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above"<br>  The Cure - "Friday, I'm in Love," "Pictures of You," "Burn," "High," "Boys Don't Cry"<br>  Cursive - "Art is Hard," "Some Red-Handed Slight of Hand"<br>  The Dandy Warhols - "Get Off"<br>  The Dead 60s - "Riot Radio"<br>  Defiance, Ohio - "Condition 11:11," "Tanks!

kP0JGI1waa	Check out Witchcraft, they are extremely throwback, they record in all analog and sound just like a 70s band.  There seems to be a new trend of sounding "retro" so you might be in luck.  Jex Thoth, Blood Ceremony, and Electric Wizard (new album, esp the song Dunwich) are all old sounding.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Dave Matthews Band  Green Day|`|Lngb8ryFaa	rock was still great thru the 90's...its the 00's that it started to decline..and i agree that no band today can come up with a full album of good songs, just one or two..    my proof: plenty of bands in the 90's came up with entire albums that were great whether you're a fan or not...ex, Tool, smashing pumpkins, radiohead, pearl jam, rage against the machine, dave matthews, ani difranco, etc....that doesnt happen nowadays|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	There's always good and bad music in every decade. If you aren't finding good rock, you need to look around more. Go to Pandora and enter the groups you like and see what it comes up with...you might be surprised.|`|OmJmRmNtaa	Nickelback|`|9Fq3jyykaa	80's rock is awesome - I think maybe you should switch to country music maybe that will fit you better|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	Coheed and Cambria  Sam Roberts  Kings of Leone  Santogold  Queens of the Stone Age  White Stripes  and even though their albums haven't been spectacular recently the Foo Fighters are still a great band    MGMT (Not rock but fun)|`|CWUHwhOpaa	There is still some good stuff out there like the RHCP, Sugar Ray, Modest Mouse, The Killers, and come on Nirvana obviously isnt around now but they were early 90's and there one of the greatest bands ever. Dont get me wrong, I do like 80's music but there still is some good stuff out there. Unfortunatly it is overlooked do to vbands like Fall Out Boy, Slipknot, Linkin Park, and any other trendy garbage like that. Stick to the good stuff like Nirvana and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.|`|1wmFh5jUaa	It's currently the boom of rap and r/nb, very rarely you find good rock. But 80's rock is still quiety common and popular  i especially love how acdc came back with a new album. good luck on your search. Rock wil always be around|`|pcdrdQHMaa	Sort of agree, but I would argue that the 90's had the last of the great rock bands. There is nothing worth listening to after the 90's.|`|AA11402617	The best days of Rock are definitely behind us.  Radio is a cesspool of over engineered music and sound alike black girl singers and white girl singers who try to sound like black girl singers.  It's disco all over again with nondescript interchangeable singers and a sudden craze for ballroom type dancing shows on TV.    Maroon 5 is probably the only group that has surfaced in the last five years that I would consider buying an album by.  I did buy the last Coldplay album but it was something of a disappointment. The album is not as good as the title single.  .|`|vidiDXxBaa	Rock that is good nowadays? Most rock now is sooo damn mainstream. My Chemical Romance, Maroon 5, Nickelback, Avril Lavigne, they are all crap. So unless you want to get into really heavy types of rock just stick to the 80s.|`|qRnXasisaa	NIN is my fav and no one does it better than Trent for me LOL|`|A8NzjbQvaa	what about 90's music?    radio head  guns n roses  oasis  any ska band.|`|ai4lrclMaa	Wow! Did you get old really early?      WTF do you mean there has been little or no no decent music since the 80's. The 80's brought us such crass commercialism as Duran Duran and the c ock rock of Eddie Money . The 80's brought us van Halen and endless soft rock sh it like Phil Collins and Micheal effing Bolton!!    The era after that...the one you claim lacks talent and inspiration... gave us Nirvana, Pearl Jam,some of the finest recordings from  the Chilli Peppers.Chris Isaak lit up country music and crossed over like no one since Johnny Cash. We had Tupac, Bodycount and Disposable Heroes of Hypoprisy. We discovered Silverchair. Nick Cave got off the drugs and proved he was a musician's musician.    Do you think that there is no merit to be found in Greenday? No catchiness about The Offspring? Are Slipknot just some flash in the pan? Have you heard of A Perfect Circle?    Simply because music from an era not your own fails to speak to YOU, does not  mean it has failed to reach an audience.    You could be part of that audience. But you need to turn down the David Gilmore, or you'll never hear what else lies out there for you!!    @EDIT: Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine.|`|yakYKhBpaa	OMG u 4got Audioslave the makers of soundgarden and rage against the machine= AUdioSLave OMG|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I enjoy the radio more now than I did in the 80's, with the exception of the show we had back then called "Metalshop", The Only Show With Teeth!|`|C0yagFFoaa	are you crazy, we had two decades of dance music it was hell, now we have razorlight, snow patrol, kaiser chiefs, and there hundreds more, toomany ot remember|`|FbZcM1nlaa	You're so right, but I think rock went into a coma in the 80's then died in the 90's lol. I can't believe some people are writing Nickelback and Coldplay, and that ****. I mean, they're talented, but you asked for rock, not people who sing about lovers in japan and wanting to be the rockstars they'll never be. Mindless 12 year olds. Can we bring back Nirvana, Kiss, Queen, etc. I recommend sticking to the old rock that you listen to now, because trust me, there's nothing out right now in this generation worth listening to.|`|CJJTdjw6aa	How could rock decline in the 80's? It was at it's height in the 80's. I have a 14 year old son who LOVES the 80's. He IS "Sweet Child O' Mine"    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-AYAv0Io...|`|LWmstMGkaa	YES!!!!!!

How about "White Wedding "|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Not much, some of the 80's bands are still making some decent stuff.  Look into alternative rock or some modern country.|`|W0VL46gDaa	ForthAngel & Alterbridge|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes the Dixie Chicks, Salsa, merengue and Bachata.As well as Rap depending on the message and the lyrics.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	No!!! Stick to the older stuff, music today is pitiful!!!!!|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Most modern bands can come up with ONE good song, but very rarely a full album.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	No    Stick to the 1980's music. It is far better|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	nope not really. it died in the 80's|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	There's plenty of good stuff out there.  But, if you think rock started to decline in the 80's you probably have poor taste and we aren't on the same page.

OO7vNLjQaa	Here is a link to see a lot of ppl's opinon of the song's meaning:<br>  <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/233/" rel="nofollow">http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2...</a><br>  <br>  Personally - This song has a lot of meanings to me.<br>  If you really look at the lyrics, Moby uses certain links to help you understand more into the word usage. <br>  I think he uses "In my dreams" referring to his subconscience state of mind. "As I wake" when his mind starts to recognize the certain emotion/feeling.<br>  <br>  I also think the song is about a person who knew from the very being of the relationship that the other never had feelings for that person like that person had for the other. So he began to sabotage the relationship as a way of ending it before that person left him. <br>  "I never meant to hurt you<br>  I never meant to lie<br>  So this is goodbye"<br>  "Tell the truth you never wanted me"<br>  <br>  That is how I interpret the song....

If I'm wearing clothes and don't have my mobile phone then I don't feel "TOTALLY naked."     However, when I'm not wearing clothes and don't have my mobile phone, then in that case I do feel "TOTALLY naked" without it.      A little bit of literal play on words answer there. If I was serious, no I'm not obsessed with it (I'm weird!) and I know how to use pay phones! Ask me if I'd feel totally naked without my double-guitar and I'd have to say yes!     - Jimmy Page (or am I?!)

cqzZjRVwaa	I don't mind the store, but I understand what you mean by getting 'battered and bruised'. During Christmas, I went to visit Liverpool and went to see the new Liverpool One shopping centre.

Primark certainly wasn't affected.|`|IPpr8Hnlaa	I sometimes shop at primark and i've never been battered or bruised and have never had something nicked off me and im not a chav or a git :/  primark has nice shoes and pj's and there reli good value!

BlZ6vJOAaa	Venus in Scorpio is sort of a selfish sign to have, concerning relationships read this:<br>  When your Venus is in Scorpio,  it's all or nothing in matters of the heart. You are capable of loving deeply, and you crave intimacy. Scorpio isn't afraid of anything, and when Venus, the planet of love, is found in this sign, love relationships are intense. Scorpio is also a sign that thrives on crisis in order for its natives to feel alive and vital, so when it comes to matters of the heart, you are not only unafraid of getting your hands dirty, you may easily find an overly predictable relationship uninteresting. <br>  <br>  Scorpios don't enjoy being referred to as jealous, but from time to time, jealousy and possessiveness become issues in your relationships. You have a strong desire to control your often turbulent passions, and you don't always let your partner exactly what is going on inside of you as a result. Others will be either strongly attracted to, or intimidated by, your obvious ability to give all to love, and your extraordinary passion. Your strong interest in love and romance can sometimes border on obsessive, and you need a partner who is willing to go the distance with you. Sexually, you are intense as well, but you definitely do not only want your partner's body--you want his or her soul as well. Sex without intimacy is ultimately uninteresting to you. <br>  <br>  Be careful that your fear of betrayal doesn't become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When insecure about your partner's feelings about you, resorting to games of power and control might seem like a natural route for you, and may even get temporary desired "results", but can have disastrous consequences in the long run. Learning to let go a little and have faith in your partner can do wonders in any relationship. When you are at your best, you are unafraid of intimacy and can offer extraordinary passion to your relationships that is pretty much unmatched.|`|cLgwmcfwaa	Mars in Leo - Venus in Scorpio<br>  <br>  With Mars in Leo you have a deep desire to be as flamboyant in your expression of love and desire as possible. No other sign can compete with your romantic energy since Leo rules love, sex and romance! Mars in Leo does tend toward the assertive pursuit of its own creative self expression and you have a strong desire for being recognized and respected in all you do. You act with nobility and pride in all aspects of life but this is especially apparent in your sexual pursuits. Mars in Leo wants to be a lover who is remembered for being warm hearted and capable of keeping the fun in love for a long time to come. And as long as you get the attention you need, you'll do just that! <br>  If Venus is in the sign Scorpio then you have an intense need to love with more physical and emotional depth and commitment than perhaps any other sign. Love is not taken lightly and once love has infiltrated your soul it's there for good. Venus in Scorpio needs to be in control of this decision to fall in love however so it's likely you'll end up being initially guarded and slow to reveal yourself to a prospective lover as you size up the genuine potential of long term romance. Sex is the ultimate expression of love to Venus in Scorpio; however you're not interested in casual sex per se. You want intimacy. You want to know the good, bad and ugly when you're in love with someone and experience the ultimate pleasures and pain together.|`|8yqxdNp0aa	y do u always ask this? even after u get answers.

frCbMSteaa	Well, first of all, it's 'Victoriandustrial"- one word.  She also does violindustrial.... I love EA, my musical diet currently consists of mostly her songs.

AA10773725	Any guy that has to hit a girl is an idiot.  It's a basic elementary concept that "hitting somone is wrong" but it also part of being a man to know that hitting a woman is unacceptable!  And as for whatever excuse he chooses for why he did it, I'm sorry Chris but that doesn't cut it buddy!  We all get frustrated at times but it what we do during these times of trouble that truly displays to others our character, or lack there of!  As a a guy who has been in a relationship with the same women for over 2 1/2 years, I would say that while neither of us is perfect I love her and myself enough to never even let that be a consideration!|`|AA10540570	For me, what happens in his personal life doesn't really have anything to do with his music. If he had any other career that wasn't in the public eye, his personal life wouldn't be a big deal. Yes, whatever he did was wrong, but we were  not there when it happened. Have no idea what happened, who started it, what was said or done-and if it has ever happened before. What if it has never happened before, he just flipped out & needs some help? So he never gets to make money again?<br>  Honestly I think we should just wait & see what happens, when all the details come out!|`|aMwQGhYyaa	I'm a woman...Unfortunately I don't think his alleged abuse will not do anything...I still know a lot of girls who are supporting this dude. I mean look at R Kelly he peed on a girl and he still is selling records...people don't care about how AWFUL someone can be...just the music.|`|AA11135726	im female. it would depend on what he did after it. since he isnt a rapper/singer than has domestic violence in his music like a lot of music today i would say that if it looks like he truly tried to change then i would go back to listening to him. but it would need to be more than just a state,ent that he is "sorry". He would have to make a effort like going to anger classes, donating money to a domestic abuse fund, and even not dating for a while. <br>  If he really seems to be making a turn around in his life than his career could potentially go back to the way that it was. he could also use this opportunity to increase knowledge about violence against women and help to stop it.|`|xXanAuLwaa	i mean it really hurts..because you see him on tv and everything and he looks like a really nice boy....he really screw things up...and i think his career is going to hell if he doesn't apologies properly like he should...i tell you the truth  i like his music but he **** up!..that shows that he just cant control himself...no i wont buy tickets.cause honestly is freaking scarry  ........|`|G2OdDlmjaa	lmao i didnt like chris in  the first place, do all you girls think he is so cute now? what a f c k i n g b i t ch|`|AA12382198	"A"  question.....LOL<br>  <br>  It does in fact look like domestic abuse. which should never be tolerated.<br>  <br>  I'm a female and a man hitting a woman for any reason is horrific and not to  be condoned.<br>  <br>  He's says he's in counseling with his friends and family.....but that's not real counseling.<br>  <br>  I like him as a musician but until I hear he's really in counseling.....I won't buy his music.|`|bkx93l8Daa	I try not to get too involved in Chris' Browns life..

uD1S5dYtaa	If you believe in life after death, as I do, I would say that she is coming to you in your dreams to comfort you.  She knows your sorrow and does not want you to mourn.  She is not in pain and does not want you to be, either.  The next time you dream of her, try to talk to her and tell her how much you miss her and love her.  Then tell her you are happy she is okay now and let her go.  If she visits you again, you should feel comforted, because she loves  you and is checking on you.  She is like a guardian angel now.|`|myuWNLsTaa	talk to someone and tell them how you feel and talk to your mom about it|`|mKfQQRDuaa	You should find actitivies that make you happy and keep your mind occupied. Have you ever tried Yoga?  It can truly help you heal your pain. The death of a loved one never truly heals.  If you believe in God, then you can live with the peace of knowing that someday you will see her again.  Knowing that she was only 43, should remind you that life is short and live to enjoy your life.  I wish you all the best!|`|ntj9WfzYaa	I think you should think about her in more positive way so that the dreams you have of her would be pleasant, and maybe you can't wait to go to sleep so that you can see her again.  I lost my Grandfather awhile back... and my dreams of him are never scary.  Your Aunt is with God now, there's no need for you to be scared.  You'll get over the pain... but you'll never forget the memory of her, nor should you.  Take care, and I pray God carries you through this difficult time.

94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	The origins of music aren't recorded because they go back further than recorded history. In other words, it's anybody's guess.

5MAJU5X7aa	The one episode that really sticks in my mind is "Threshold". Episode 15 of season 2.<br>  <br>  Here is the synopsis of it from <a href="http://www.startrek.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.startrek.com</a><br>  <br>  Production: 132<br>  Season: 2 Episode: 15<br>  DVD Disc: 4<br>  Air Date: 01.29.1996<br>  Stardate: 49373.4<br>  <br>  Synopsis: <br>   <br>  Following a series of holodeck simulations to reach Warp 10, Paris and the engineering team iron out the technical glitches and prepare to send Paris out on a real flight. The next day, the crew watches as Paris takes the Shuttlecraft Cochrane to Warp 10, crosses the transwarp threshold, and abruptly vanishes. <br>  <br>  Moments later, the Cochrane emerges from subspace, and they beam Paris to Sickbay. He appears no worse for wear, weakened but exhilarated by the experience, which he likens to "being everywhere at once." As Torres and Janeway discuss the potential of the data obtained in Paris' brief flight, a crewmember named Jonas eavesdrops on the conversation. Later, the duplicitous Jonas sends information on Paris' Warp 10 flight to the Kazon. <br>  <br>  Not long after his trip, Paris collapses in the mess hall. Rushed to Sickbay, the Doctor tracks dramatic changes in Paris' biochemistry. His organs are mutating and his cell membranes are deteriorating rapidly. Despite the Doctor's best efforts, Paris dies. However, hours later, Paris begins breathing again. When the Doctor examines him, he is amazed to find that the Lieutenant now has two hearts! <br>  <br>  Paris is by no means out of danger. A series of accelerated mutations leave him radically transformed and subject to bouts of paranoia and violence. The Doctor figures out a medical procedure to destroy Paris' mutant DNA, but it's interrupted when Paris breaks out of confinement. <br>  <br>  Paris kidnaps Janeway and takes her to the Cochrane, launching them both on another Warp 10 journey. Voyager locates the vessel three days later on an uninhabited jungle planet. Paris and Janeway have mutated into amphibians and mated, producing two offspring, which the crew leaves behind on the planet. Once Paris and Janeway are brought back to Voyager, the Doctor is able to perform the procedure to eliminate the mutant DNA from their bodies and they return to normal, albeit rather embarrassed about recent events.|`|kQ2LCu3Eaa	None, they all suck|`|4hwVFSzyaa	fair haven|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	It would have to be the one in the 1st season where he has a food fight with Neelix over Kes, then Janeway sends them on an away mission and they stranded on the planet.

Q8Rx0QZeaa	It is at least one of the top five movies ever made if you can Truly appreciate movies. Its not the same as Goodfellas but it is a great movie. If you like Goodfellas try Casino, Godfather, or Carlito's Way. But i recommend Shawshank just for a good movie experience.|`|VA3tGarQaa	It's a little over rated. The sort of movie you watch once, think "Oh, that was good" and then never watch again. It's a fine movie, but nothing to get excited about. You can sort of predict what is going to happen all the way through.<br>  <br>  If you're the sort of person like me who watches a lot of serious and independent films, you won't find it amazing.|`|XuEMf100aa	The Shawshank Redemption is amazing and should be on any movie buffs top 10.  I mean come on, Morgan Freeman narrating? how can you not go wrong.  The message of redemption is well done and it probably would have won best picture had it not been released in 94 the same time Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction were released.|`|a07JT9mFaa	It was a great movie but not really amazing. It's one of those movies when you watch it, it sticks with you but not something that you'll want to watch over and over again.Same with Goodfellas really.|`|6IGph0K9aa	It is a fantastic movie about human faith, friendship, and struggle, and really not stephen kings kind of ... truly a have to see.|`|bHQpwVlXaa	I seen it and I got it|`|7D44tO9Daa	it is an AMAZING movie! <br>  i don't know why, just something about it is amazing!|`|AA11828439	Good, not the best. Goodfellas wasn't even in the top 500.|`|7fXpLlhBaa	Yes absolutely. It really is that good. I can watch it over and over again and it never fails to amaze me. The ending is quite a pleasing shocker if you've never seen it. Go rent or buy it right now!|`|hat60KYXaa	It's worth seeing.  Don't compare the two unless you've seen both.  I have and I think Shawshank is better, but neither are the best of all time.  The Godfather is.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	It was pretty good but I would not call it amazing.<br>  <br>  There were some elements in the original story that I wished they had kept in.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	It's great but highly overrated. You should definitely watch it.<br>  <br>  I think Godfather I and II are the best movies ever made and To Kill A Mocking Bird is my favorite.

OWXI806qaa	Yes, absolutely!<br>  I have been watching 24 for a long time now, & I can honestly<br>  say that it's my favorite TV show ever. But you have definitely<br>  have to watch it beyond Season One.<br>  A lot of people only watch the first season, <br>  & then decide they don't like it. That is a huge mistake. <br>  24 changes a lot after season 1.<br>  But I think it gets really good once you get to S4. It's good from<br>  the beginning, but it really gets explosive in season 4.<br>  <br>  Season 7 is currently airing right now, & I can't believe how<br>  awesome it's been. You really need to watch more.<br>  Trust me, I know. And after you pass Season 1, you really<br>  start to know the characters more, & then it means more, <br>  I guess.<br>  <br>  24 is probably one of the most action packed, suspenseful,<br>  surprising, dramatic show I have ever seen. And it has really<br>  good plot lines too. But you need to watch more than just <br>  S1. And I'll tell you this, there's gonna be really big twist at the<br>  end of S1, so be prepared.<br>  <br>  Well, I hope I could help. And I hope I convinced you.<br>  Happy watching!|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	You really need to watch the first three seasons. It helps to understand what is happening now. Many of the characters are from prior seasons and you won't get the full significance of the characters and what they are doing without the proper context and character development. It will make the show more enjoyable. You'll miss the whole CTU experience without viewing the prior seasons.|`|04bfb627b3dd9d8645997d3bb5894f40aa	ABSOLUTELY!  Though some seasons are better the rest, you need to watch it for the backstory alone...how characters are tied together, who has been loyal to whom and what became of people.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, some of them are just super good and keep you on the edge of your seat!  I was behind when i first started watching it and at that time, I remember driving from Blockbuster to Blockbuster just to get my hands on the next DVD installment!  <br>  <br>  And enjoy David Palmer as the President!  He is still the BEST ONE!

The Maste bedroom would be an oriental style, the guest bedroom would be african style, the bathrooms would be beachy/hawaiian, the kitchen/dining room would be italian style, and the living room wouldn't really have a style but I would have a nice computer station/desk, a big screen t.v., a gaming system, complete with my favorite movies and games, and a nice pull out couch. <br>  I would also like two-car garage, a garden, a basketball court, and a pool.

BLmyeLdTaa	Because he knows it would hurt Tyra. She has raised Anna on her own since she was a baby it would be wrong to adopt her. Tyra would basically be like a visiting relative. Neil has feelings for Tyra and I am sure that is playing a role in his decision too.|`|ubKdwVz8aa	I think he wants to hold off because of how it would make Tyra feel. Here they are supposed to be trying to help her...."not" steal her child. Even though she is not legally hers...she is her aunt who has raised her as her own. She should be given some say so. To just adopt her would be a slap in the face to Tyra and Neil is not that kind of person.|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	i agree.  i hate tyra and could care less about ana...<br>  i wish the storyline would disappear or dru return|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Because whether Karen likes it or not, the only way they knew about Ana in the first place is because Tyra came to GC with her, so why would he want to take her away from Tyra. Tyra never said she doesn't want Ana anymore.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	I think it's because he has feelings for Tyra and he doesn't want to hurt her. Unfortunately I believe that he and tyra are going to get together and karen will be left out in the cold. I can't believe the writers are giving him that storyline. he was always such a stand up guy and for him to cheat on karen after going to all the trouble he did to get her is just wrong. can't stand tyra btw.

But none can really touch George Strait.|`|LqlHpiOraa	I think all time it would be<br>  Tim McGraw<br>  For their age<br>  Taylor Swift<br>  But come on now.. you cant forget <br>  C. Underwood<br>  T. Keith<br>  R. Macentire <br>  F. Hill<br>  G. Strait<br>  D. Bentaly<br>  R. Atkins<br>  A. Jackson<br>  and many many more|`|5LAFteSAaa	Josh Turner, wich i am not a huge fan of his songs, but the guys can probably sing about poop and could make it sound good. great voice.<br>  <br>  the greatest is probably a three way tie between Garth Brooks, George Strait, and Clint Black.|`|CO2o0YYMaa	The King.

Nobody even comes close to matching his voice.<br>  <br>  As for conveying pure country emotion, there's only one:  Hank Williams.  He may have been laughing all the way to the bank when he sang "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," but he sang it in such a way that you hurt for him.|`|uxU5lOLYaa	all time:  Hank Sr<br>  today:  George Strait|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Really hard to be definitive here as there are many greats like Willie Nelson, Conway Twitty, Hank Sr., Johnny Cash and Buck Owens but strictly on the basis of pure traditional country singing, I'm going with the Possum, George Jones.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Voice.

A man and a woman have sex: we see the man's bare chest and he thrusts from behind, they moan, we see her bare breasts, and they are interrupted by noises outside. A woman unbuttons her top to reveal her bra while a man watches, she then removes her bra revealing bare breasts and rubs oil on her chest and breasts; the man picks the woman up and takes her to a tent. A woman water-skis topless and bare breasts are seen. A woman who has been stabbed through the head by a machete is lifted out of water and her bare breasts are seen. Women wear low-cut tops and dresses that reveal cleavage in many scenes. A man looks at a pornographic magazine and we see a fully nude woman with bare breasts and pubic area completely visible; the man licks the page where the woman's pubic region is represented and talks to the page. A man looks at a clothing catalog and prepares to masturbate by unfastening his pants (he is interrupted). A man pulls a tarp off a female mannequin, caresses the breasts and talks to it making references to losing his virginity to it. A man stands behind a woman and makes sexual thrusting movements, unbeknownst to her. A woman dances seductively while two men watch her (she is wearing short shorts and a short top that reveal cleavage, bare abdomen and back and bare legs) and talk about never being able to have sex with her. A man and a woman kiss. A man buys a box of condoms. A man asks another man and a woman where they are going, the man says, "to make out" and the other man tells him to "wear a condom." A man tells a woman to "have sex with your boyfriend" (meaning himself). A woman slaps her bare leg swatting away a mosquito and a man makes a sexual remark inviting her to do that again.|`|29132974a862c9fc817fd555a52845f5aa	They don't last long, but they're not like really quick either.

fI4LqMVMaa	I really liked it, and I don't think it's a rip off of high school musical.  I do believe it is nick's response to high school musical and its fame, but to say it's a rip off implies that Spectacular took things (including most notably the plot) from HSM and that is just not true.<br>  <br>  hsm - kids afarid of what other kids would think of them if they loved something else and didn't "stick to the status quo" <br>  <br>  Spectacular- Acutally is about a group compteing in a song and dance competition and showing off their talent.<br>  <br>  See?  Different plot lines.  If you're going to claim that spectacular is a rip off of HSM, then HSM is definatly a rip off of Greese.<br>  <br>  The only things they share are that they are musicals (which many movies nowadays are), they are set in high school (not uncommon in movies)  that there is some sort of competition (a common conflict in movies) and that there is love between the titular characters (again, common in most movies)<br>  <br>  As I was just saying in another question under this topic:<br>  I don't think it's a copy because they have totally different plotllines, and the characters have totally different goals. Troy doesn't want anyone to know he likes music at first, whereas Nikko loves music and has always made that clear. I just saw spectacular, and I loved it. I'm bummed out though because I missed the begining.  From what I saw though, it's equally as good as if not better then HSM, and I'm going to buy it when it comes out on DVD. The songs are great, I just bought three on itunes. I would have bought the whole soundtrack, but I ran out of money.  Really, the music is fantastic.  The songs really make you happy, they make you want to sing and dance.<br>  <br>  I know I'm expressing an unpopular opinion in this question, but I hope that I helped in any case (if only by providing another viewpoint) <br>  ~Clarkie<br>  <br>  P.S. Not very good looking, tommynguyen_13?  Nikko was hot!|`|jKph4peTaa	it was BETTER than hsm. and im F'in sick and tired of people comparing it to freaking HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL in the first place. the singing, dancing, and storyline was way better than hsm. some narrow minded people just dont know how to give something a chance without comparing it to something that theyre apparently obsessed with.<br>  <br>  && i agree with Clarkie 100%|`|G7oAaXnUaa	it was good.<br>  it was basically a rip off of Disney's HSM<br>  the title is stupid<br>  dancing was ok, singing was ok<br>  that girl(the main character besides nikko) really annoyed me though<br>  and why would they name him 'nikko'?<br>  overall though it was good i'd definitly watch the sequel to it|`|yfMD4hpsaa	ughh. i thought it was definately a rip-off of high school musical. it was horrible to watch. if you're going to copy the main parts of another movie, make it better, especially with better actors|`|6ci6R1l7aa	it looked wack and i wasnt gonna watch it but honestly by the look of it .to me spectacular was a bootleg high school musical :]|`|rotppwjpaa	it was a rip off of hsm3.

Hitchcock is one of the greatest that I can think of right now, Psycho is great to start.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for something more contemporary, I'd check out something like 28 Days later (Zombie flick with plenty of suspensful moments). <br>  Saw francise is considered to be a horror thriller, but if you're looking for that I'd stick with the first movie since it has the most suspense.<br>  <br>  Less horror driven suspense films would include things like The transporter, Carrie, and even more hitchcock (what can i say, he's the master of the genre)|`|6366bcdfeb504661288751f4ab8d1df4aa	Hi,<br>  I saw one of the questions you answered earlier and couldn't find a way to contact you so this is the only way i could contact you.<br>  I'm 15 as well and i was thinking of getting a blackberry bold but i mean it's more like of a business user phone however i really do like it.

24UPDIBTaa	Have you seen Amanda's new show Sanctuary? Just curious.<br>  <br>  I think the writers mostly just hinted at romantic feelings between the Jack O'Neil and Samantha Carter characters. There were also alternate realities were they showed them together, I believe, but I've heard Richard Dean Anderson was against focusing on that angle over the big picture of the series. I'm guessing Anderson just got bored with it, honestly, and could afford to leave. He still came back a few times to cameo, so he didn't totally abandon the show. <br>  <br>  I think the closest Carter had to romance was when she got together with the cop character played by Dom DeLuise's son, David?, but that didn't last and I think the writers basically took long-term romantic relationships out of the series after that. There might be flirting or in-the-moment kisses, but they didn't give a lot of screen time to two characters being together on a recurring basis. Rodney McKay did have two different relationships on SG: Atlantis, but they generally took place while he was trapped in a room with the women under severe conditions. Lucky guy, eh?<br>  <br>  Daniel was never really the lead male, because they wanted the focus on the military guys doing the action, but he played an important role in his two stints (Corin Nemec filled in for awhile) on the series and later in the SG: Atlantis series. He was usually teamed with Carter or McKay as the duo doing the heavy duty thinking. After the O'Neil character left, they brought in Ben Browder from another Sci-Fi Channel show that got the axe and he was the action-hero male lead.<br>  <br>  FYI:<br>  <br>  There's supposed to be a new Stargate series coming in the next year. I've read about the cast and a description. I'll give it a try, but it worries me already. They're using the Star Trek: Voyager set-up by completely separating a small group of heroes from their known universe and they're supposed to have a lot of inexperienced members (younger cast gets younger audience concept). <br>  <br>  What bothers me is that on the other two Stargates many powerful enemies were faced and often couldn't be stopped by the main group alone. They needed alien weaponry and lots of help from both allies and Stargate Command. How am I supposed to believe a green cast of characters will be able to survive daunting situations apart from Stargate Command troops and reconfigured alien technology when the established teams on the other series often needed that back-up? They better have a couple prodigies in the group and find powerful allies to take them in quickly. These types of shows seem to enjoy coming up with bigger, better enemies and I don't think this group can go it alone under those circumstances. I'm going to give it a chance, just not expecting much.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	I don't think it effected the dynamics of the show at all.<br>  Teal'c is the best one and he stayed :D|`|1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	Well it has been over as a show for awhile now so moot but they make movies now|`|aezgpwhSaa	Yes, Jack O'Neill added something wonderful to the show, but around Season 7 you could tell he was getting tired of it.  In fact he was only working part time I think after Season 6, as he wanted to spend more time with his kid in L.A. and the commute was brutal.  <br>  <br>  Sam is in Atlantis, but there is nothing like the tension you had between Sam and Jack, going as far back to the first season where they got trapped in that glacier together.  Well, there are always reruns (and DVD's)|`|FKmmvwgMaa	I totally agree. To answer you question, I once thought that they ended up together but then Sam is in some of Stargate Atlantis episodes so I'm not sure anymore. I got discouraged about the show when Jack and Sam were taken out but season 9 & 10 were ok even still. I do however, think that it's what led to the discontinuation of the series.|`|AcvSost8aa	Yes Jack left. Sad but true. He comes back from time to time. <br>  I will pretend you did not diss Daniel. :)<br>  I think the romance for Sam lies with Dr. Rodney McKay. She goes to Atlantis around the 5th season I think. You might want to Google it to be sure.|`|ER94paD2aa	who cares

I was so excited for this last season, and so far, it good tv, but I'm not liking what they are doing with our faves.

a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Listen to music. If you should REALLY be sampling, something will pop out at you, especially if you're not just listening to rap.<br>  While RZA sampled a lot of Thelonius Monk, DJ Lethal took a lot of old soul music. What you want is a program for audio editing, like audacity. But if you already have Edison, that's another route to go.|`|jhMkBqk7aa	If you want to take pre done samples by other producers, listen to J Dilla and Pete Rock's stuff especially T.R.OY. if you want original samples I suggest either techno, classic rock, something with a saxophone, or taking female R&B singers and speeding them up.

Ctq3pcIsaa	no he does not. it was all rihannas fault|`|duXQDmTRaa	well him being cute and talented aside; this man did something that is not socially accepted and never should be. and at that he got caught, which he completely deserves. so i believe he completely deserves the demise. however, maybe he can pull his career back together after he makes a sincere apology to rihanna and begins to do things differently so people can overlook his obvious abuse issues.|`|debd88ba854235616404976c9128cee6aa	I have little interest in his kind of music myself but it's for people to judge if he's guilty/not guilty of beating her up. If it's true then it's for people to judge whether or not they want to boycott his music.<br>  <br>  It's a tricky issue.|`|Csp84Bnlaa	it WAS wrong for him to hit her but i think that his career shouldn't be in jeopardy when other celebrities went through issues THEY weren't pulled from the radio stations! So we gossip- lovers need to just keep or opinions to our self and leave these poor celebrities alone.|`|vweoheAvaa	While I understand that he was upset because she apparently gave him herpes, it's his fault for not having her tested before he slept with her. Therefore, he brought this on himself & he shouldn't have hit her.|`|ByyfoeAUaa	Hey, if you want to keep your career (any career) you don't go around beating up women and making death threats.|`|V3tViL6Maa	his a dam idiot how the **** will do that .|`|FMpPWqnHaa	are u trying to say its rihanna's fault and chris brown doesn't deserve this just because he CUTE? are freakin kidding me|`|POHWTDPRaa	No, I don't think he does. But not for the reason that you do. A celebrity's personal life is separate from their professional life. It is unfortunate that personal, private things often get made public but Chris Brown the person has nothing to do with Chris Brown the product. People who are fans of his music can't just decide to not like it anymore. It doesn't work that way. But he is losing fans because of something that has nothing to do with his music and isn't any of our business. That's BS. It shouldn't be happening.|`|1l04qpOKaa	Yes I think he does, any man who hits a woman is not a man at all! no one causes themselves to be assaulted, maybe she was a ***** but no one deserves that.|`|8SEVTKz5aa	HOW CAN U SAY THAT???!!! for the good of womenhood! so if u did something or said something bad, u would want ur bf or husband to hit u just cus u desever it??? IT U CAN YEA, I HOPE U GET BEATED JUST LIKE HER! think of this from a reasonable point, not just cuz hes cute. i dont give a f what he looks like, its his actions that matter|`|sqR0iyuWaa	I suppose everyone deserves a second chance. And I mean that in therms of his career, not in terms of his relationship. That needs to be OVER. But it hasn't been that long. Let him get trash talked a little longer so he really learns his lesson.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	The first time a guy beats the crap out of you because he thinks you deserve,please come here and tell us you deserved it.<br>  <br>  Any man who beats on women is garbage,plain and simple.<br>  it|`|hKax9Jl6aa	First and foremost, a man NEVER hits a woman under any circumstances! He could've just been the bigger person and walked away. Yea he's a punk and deserves prison if guilty- I said "if"...|`|897a2fe6b6c76e90fe430c2613a38ffdaa	Rhianna caused it on herself? Are you effing kidding me? No, no matter what the situation a man should never beat a women..EVER. What kind of guy chokes his girlfriend and threatens to kill her.. a douche. And although I used to be a fan of his, I think most people will never look at him in a respectable way again. He needs to pay for his consequences, and if that's having his career ruined..then let it be.|`|QlR0XAIGaa	well...i feel the same as u.b/c....i believe riri had to do something very disturbing to him to make him hit her. a lot of ppl r saying "she probably deserved it"....but y? what did she do....we all dont know the whole sorry....so im just on both side....i love them both tho.|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	However it turns out, it turns out.<br>  <br>  IF it is true and he did it, he must account for his own actions.<br>  <br>  And what kind of an idiot thinks that someone brought a beating on herself?|`|e9ppRrkMaa	I don't have anything against rihanna or chris brown. Chris Brown shouldn't have his cereer tooken away.|`|xplSmeCYaa	To me I felt that he was wrong for what he did but I don't think that people should banned his music I still listen to him. And I still will.|`|BIwZ7klfaa	who the hell is Chris Brown?|`|PN7XMglOaa	Kay , have you ever been beaten by a boyfriend ? No one , I repeat no one has the right to hit a woman . You believe him?|`|7IVEMAg8aa	There is no excuse for a man to hit a woman.
xzahKZdzaa	sun/moon Libra/Gemini<br>  The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a very airy and magnetic personality, voluble, expressive, talkative, with an ability to hold an audience. Dramatics are your specialty and you know how to get your point across with flair. This combination blends the emotional balance, courtesy and friendliness of Libra with the intellectual cleverness, flexibility and adaptability of Gemini. Success is gained through a wide array of intellectual interest and self-expression. You don't dive deeply into any subjects, but you have a sharp mind that penetrates quickly and accurate. You may work your mind overtime, but otherwise you don't believe much in hard work. You can be hard to pin down and draw out of the clouds. Glibness and social poise attach to this position. You don't like to take on responsibility and you don't work well under pressure. Restless and nervous, you need to be kept busy and occupied. You can see both sides of any question and at time you have some difficult making up your mind. You definitely belong to the intellectual group and you may feel that there should be no limit to the amount of education one obtains. You have a sense of balance or equilibrium, tending to keep affairs harmonious and pleasant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  rising Aquarius<br>  Aquarius rising produces a personality that is creative, independent and detached. It is a sign that suggests many unique qualities. Often, an unusual personality which is different and ahead of its time emerges. You are intelligent and in many ways eccentric. You have a good mind that is spontaneous, inventive, original, and unique. Yet you always seem to operate on intuition and impulse, instead of a set plan. If you resist these natural inclinations to be "different," and attempt to conform to be like everybody else, you're apt to revert and rebel at crucial and inopportune times. You can become high-strung and unpredictable, thinking of yourself as a maverick. The thing you fear most is being "fenced in" and suffering the loss of your innate individuality. You are friendly and can always make significant contributions to group activities. Even in a group, you remain personally independent and somehow resist yielding to, or becoming part of, the establishment.<br>   <br>  You can seem cool and calculating where feelings are concerned. The Aquarius personality expresses the most humanitarian instincts of the signs, but it does so in a very impersonal and detached manner. You care about people in a special way, while sometimes being accused of neglecting family and those closest to you. You can always think of ways that things could be improved, and you are a reformer at heart.<br>   <br>  Your original and free flowing spirit allows you to succeed at most intellectual pursuits. Yet you may have difficulties with everyday mundane affairs. Being tolerant, broad-minded and curious, your interests may include many "off beat" areas of life. You especially enjoy anything that involves helping some segment of society, or reforms for the benefit of humankind.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Libra and Aquarius Rising:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>              You are very intelligent as well as being a really idealistic. You are fairly popular with the masses and have a great way with words. You also have an innate refinement and style that usually comes with being born into a higher station in life, literally or figuratively. You naturally have class. You like to mix socially and could use that characteristic as the basis for financial success.<br>  <br>              There is seriousness and an adventurous spirit deep inside your nature even through you tend to have a happy-go-lucky personality and may even be flippant at times. There may also be a sadistic or darker side to your personality that actually lives on an over active imagination and the bad fortune of others.<br>  <br>              In the business world it would be best if you found a good way to exploit your intelligence and curiosity without having to involve yourself in the nuts and bolts of the day to day operations. You are kinda lazy by nature. Design and planning are your forte not keeping your nose to the grindstone. You have good communication skills too.<br>  <br>              You might be fairly lucky through-out life but don't have a huge amount of real ambition because of this horoscope placement and your smarts. That usually makes this specific Astrological combination better for the female because she will be able to benefit more from the inborn popularity and is more naturally less competitive.<br>  <br>              Your whole philosophy of Life is based upon affection, love and romance. You have an emotional need, a physical need and a spiritual need for Love and co-habitation; and innately know it. You are never at a loss for companionship if you want it.

My sister died of cervical cancer but I don't bear a grudge against poor Jade.  She will be remembered for a long time to come.  I would get your facts right first too - as Gartom so rightly says.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Of course people will remember her!<br>  <br>  Who are you to say what she should or shouldn't do?<br>  <br>  You live your life and leave Jade to live whats left of hers, there is no right or wrong, only whats right for the individual.<br>  <br>  I wish you well in your battle, my thoughts are with you, as they are with Jade!|`|FxmDmTG1aa	i dont even know who he/she is now???|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	I am sorry if you or someone in your family has been affected by cancer.<br>  <br>  However you are completely wrong about Jade.<br>  <br>  Most areas have already seen a dramatic increase in the number of people booking in for smear tests, and this is purely because of the publicity that Jade has received, and this is only based on statistics before November last year - the figure since then is probably even higher.  No-one can say that that isn't a good thing.  If it saves even one person's life then all of Jade's publicity would have been worth it, but the reality is that it will probably save far more than that.<br>  <br>  I would never say that she has lived her life without dignity.  You may not like her, you may not agree with some of the things that she says and does, but ultimately, she has done everything her way and not let anyone tell her what to do, and to me is the ultimate in having dignity.<br>  <br>  What do you mean, popping out children in unsteady relationships?  She has two children who both have the same father.  Yes, her relationship with their father has now ended, but there are millions of people in Britain who have children with multiple different partners - she hasn't done that though.<br>  <br>  I would love to make a donation to Cancer Research but unfortunately as a result of the recession I have taken a pay cut and I really don't have even a penny to spare.  However, I do contribute my time to my local hospice.  Why do you assume that anyone who cares about Jade doesn't contribute to charity - how are the two things connected?|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	i think  people will remember Jade for many years to come, weather  you like her or not she won't be forgotten in a hurry  and has made people  more aware of cervical cancer and possibly could save lives by doing so , everyone has lost people to this dreadful disease it doesn't  mean we can;t feel sympathy for someone in the public eye   she is the same as the rest of us at the end of the day .Human<br>  <br>  and your little comment about giving to  cancer charity  or any other  charity how do you know we don't ??|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	people will remember her for a very long time to come like it or not she is a celebrity and has raised a huge amount of awarness for young women to go and get smear tests SOME have come back possitive so please do not kick someone when down as low as they possible could be.<br>  I lost a daughter at 25yrs and to loose her was devestating to say the least but so young makes it very hard and Jade will be remembered AND expect a huge outpour of grief for her too.|`|op55FtqYaa	She didn't shave her head you arrogant git. Her hair fell out through chemo. You're obviously just someone who's read the papers and not actually bothered to watch the TV show she has. <br>  <br>  Yes, people everywhere are fighting cancer.

She's also raising awareness for cervical cancer and on the 6.30pm news on ITV, there was a lady who went to get a smear done thanks to Jade and they caught her cancer in the early stages and it's treatable. Jade has two kids with one father and isn't "popping them out" like you claim. Her hair fell out due to her treatment and it wasn't shaved off so get your facts right. If Shilpa can forgive her, why can't people like you do the same? Maybe people will donate to cancer research because of this, i know i will give what i can.|`|AA12140407	We are not fawning over her ,we feel for her ,I feel sorry for you too ,for having such a ice cold heart ,|`|83da748f3b46eab7db9bed0d48d3da85aa	I can see your point but think you may be allowing your personal anger to spill over into unnecessary cruelty. I know she has been a difficult media force to take in the past and perhaps even now. In answer to your main question, surely all that matters is that her children remember her, and her family and that the press leave them alone. I also hop the remaining family have the dignity not to parade the children in the media spotlight because of their Mum and their loss. That would be appalling but I suspect it will happen.|`|VqUnMMeIaa	They certainly will remember her. She has made an incredible contribution to raising awareness about cancer. As others have said, the amount of people booking cervical smears which they have put off doing, has massively increased since Jade spoke out about her cancer. She's also made it okay to talk about death, which is a really positive thing. People shouldn't have to hide away just because they are terminally ill. Jade speaking out about death has made it easier for others to talk about death, which is very much a taboo subject.<br>  <br>  I think she has been incredibly brave by doing this. She has nothing to gain, but through her actions, many other people will benefit, as well as her children who she is trying to provide for financially after her death.<br>  <br>  It's a terribly sad situation and at 27, she has gone through an enormous amount, including a father who died of a heroin overdose, a mother who was addicted to crack. All credit to her for being such a great mum.|`|W2bLgLzdaa	As an American, most of us don't know who she is. However, the are recent articles in the Times and The New York Post examining whether or not it's ethical to document your death on tv, and why the UK is so engrossed in it.  Personally, I don't understand it myself.  There are people everyday who are in the same situation as she is. They have families and young children. They are in that daily struggle like she is.  I could not imagine the pain she is going through knowing she is going to die because I am not walking in her shoes. Therefore, I cannot judge her, and I don't.  I can only hope that she is really doing all that she is doing for the good of her babies. <br>  <br>  But what I don't understand is the media and public's obsession with her..  Seriously, I think that's more out of control than anything. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love England. But when a country considers Jordan and Peter what's his face celebrities with horrible fake tans and people like Jade before cancer, something is wrong with that picture. <br>  <br>  And finally, for someone who is fighting for their life also, who are you to have an opinion on whether or not someone is living their life with dignity. That would make anyone a horrible person for lying about having cancer. But what's worse, it make you a horrible person for insinuating that she's lying.|`|drXe7aDeaa	how can you say that have some respect !! <br>  have you not heard of chemotherapy you get it and that results in your hair falling out ! she is fighting for her kids they are her life and she loves them and wants to give them the best in the future because she won't be there ! just because she isn't perfect who is that doesn't mean she should have people saying all these mean things about her when she is about to die. she is even selling wedding pictures so her children can go to school all jade really wants is for them to be happy! have you not watch the news lots more people are getting smear tests done to make sure they don't get cervical cancer because of jade she is a young healthy girl and no one thought she would get cancer. she has two children with the same man is that really popping them out ! yes she was really mean towards shlipa shetty but shilpa forgave her because she went out to india and said sorry to her, she has even invited her to her marraige and funeral because she is know her friend. how do you know people dont already donate! i do every year and i do a swim for it because its awful i went through this when my cousin died from cancer and i would never wish this on anyone even if they were the meanst person in the world because it is awful !

I'm like 99.9% sure for that matter. Anyway, the girl above me is correct saying "Freek 'N You" is a Jodeci song. But I know it isn't the one you're asking about. The one you're asking about is called "What about Us?" It's on the album Diary of a Mad Band. Here is the link to it on Wikipedia.........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_A_Mad_Band" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_A_...</a><br>  <br>  I just wanted to add, Jodeci is pretty much the only R&B group I ever really got into. I always liked their unique sound and style. It's too bad they never came out with a reunion album. But hey, you never know. haha.<br>  <br>  Edit: I noticed the girl above me got 2 thumbs up, which is OK. haha. But trust me, the song is called "What About Us?" If anyone doesn't believe me, listen to the song on Diary of a Mad Band. Or, maybe download it online. You don't even have to download the entire thing, since the "I wanna love you" is sung right at the beginning of the song.

Those guys that came up with it ought to be fired, but as far as it being racist, i dont think so. How come its ok for al sharpton to make comments and its ok, but if the comment comes from a white person its considered racist. Would it have been racist if the joke was drawn by 2 black people, and 2 cops shot a white rhino and made comments about bush. This country is so far out of whack right now, people are seeing what they want to, and not what is really happening.

BOrFGNbOaa	To any Obama lovers out there, let me say now that I'm seriously giving the guy a chance, I'm in no way trying to tear him down, I'm just answering a question.<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  I can sort of see where Emerald is coming from in that statement. Because Obama has this amazing hold over the people of America with the way his speeches are he could probably talk them into agreeing with anything he comes up with. That in itself is dangerous considering he may talk us into going along with some unfair restricting law and make us think it's for our own good.<br>  <br>  And did you see how fast the Congress agreed to his new stimulus plan after he went out and started selling the idea to the people? When Bush came up with a stimulus plan it took a few days for Congress to let it go through because they wanted to get it right. What the IRS and the banks did with that money, however, is totally on them. But the point is Obama knows the best way to get Congress on his side is to go for the voters that put Congressmen in office. <br>  <br>  I'll give him kudos for being smart like that and working the system, might come in handy when Congress wants to bully him...but it might be a bad thing as well considering checks and balance and the fact Congress might be able to improve on some of his ideas he may inadvertently put a stop to that thinking he's doing something better. <br>  <br>  In short the guy knows what he's doing and at the same time he doesn't know what he's doing. Either way, depending on the situation, it could hurt the country. (As far as Obama being feared...well I'll keep that opinion to myself)|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	If his foreign policy turns out to be as bad as his economic policies, I'm already shaking in my shoes.|`|AA11892241	Rory Emerald is a serial prankster who's modus operandi is placing fake classified ads claiming to have found bizarre items. This guy has no credibility.  He just wants to be in the news.  He will do/say almost anything to get in the news. So, take anything he says with that background and a grain of salt.  <br>  <br>  Why should we be scared/feared of Obama?  It's universal that he is smart and very thoughtful.  Both parties agree.  And he will get better with experience. Plus, he has an all-star Cabinet (two Republicans) and staff.  We still have checks and balances; so, he is not going to run amuck. <br>  <br>  He didn't work the system and ram the stimulus package through Congress.  It was a hard fought process that gave concessions to Republicans for tax cuts. 45% of the stimulus is tax cuts.  Please see <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090221/ts_nm/us_obama">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090221/ts_n...</a><br>  <br>  He's only been the President for a month. He truly wants to fix America's problems, with bipartisan input and support. He is not a Liberal extremist.  He will govern from the middle.  So, not to worry...enjoy the ride.<br>  <br>  The scary thing, that should be feared, is that he won't be given a chance, and we will have a Congress that continues to point fingers, and gets nothing done.<br>  <br>  The person that should be feared is Rory.  :D<br>  <br>   Please see <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/comments/rory_emerald/" rel="nofollow">http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblo...</a>

Oz9dSr32aa	The song off Get Awkward "Becky" was banned from the US version of the cd because of the lyrical meaning. It's about a friend who back-stabs another friend and the back-stabbed friend turns around and actually stabs her in the back. It's a good song. I also like "Food Fight". It shows youth in fun in immaturity;]

lwjPWjPRaa	Visit <a href="http://www.peteranswers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteranswers.com</a> where there are two text boxes: "Insert Petition" and "Insert Question."<br>  <br>   <br>  Ask your audience for a question. If it's a question you know the answer to, proceed to the next step. If it's a question you don't know the answer to, you can ask them for the answer, telling them that if they say the question and answer out loud, Peter will hear them with his psychic powers. If you don't know the answer, you won't be able to follow the next step, and Peter will answer with a very generic statement like "You shall not doubt of me at all, keep trusting on me and soon I'll answer." In other words, the trick won't work! <br>  Enter text into the petition box. The directions tell you to type in either "Peter, please answer the following question:" or "Peter, please answer:" in the petition box. What your audience doesn't know is that you're telling Peter the answer...<br>  <br>  <br>  Note the colon ":" at the end of each of these queries. This is essential because without it, you will not be able to proceed to the question box. Once you type the phrase and enter the colon, your cursor will automatically move to the question box. <br>  Instead of typing "Peter, please answer the following question:" or "Peter, please answer:" start off your petition with a period followed by the answer you're looking for. For example, if you intend to ask "Why is wikiHow the best how-to manual ever?" then in the petition box you would type<br>  <br>  .Because it's a group effort <br>  As you type the answer you're looking for, that's not what you will see showing up in the text box. You will see the standard petition being typed, even though you're typing something completely different. Your audience, however, will have their eyes on the screen and will never suspect that you're giving Peter the answer. <br>  Your answer should be shorter than one of the standard petitions. When you finish typing the answer, the standard petition will still need to be finished on the screen. In the following screenshot, all that has been typed is ".Because it's a group effort"<br>  <br>   <br>  So, after you type the answer, end it with a period. The period will show up as another character of the petition. After the period, however, anything you type will show up on the screen as you type it. Finish whatever is left of the query and send it off with a colon. In this screenshot, the actual typing was ".Because it's a group effort.owing:"<br>  <br>   <br>  Type in the question. Be sure to end it with a question mark "?". As soon as you enter the question mark, a box will appear with some warnings about privacy. For Peter to answer the question, you'll need to click the "I Accept" button.<br>  <br>   <br>  Watch as Peter thinks for a second and then displays the answer that you typed. If your audience doesn't know that you typed in the answer, they will be flabbergasted. You can probably keep them amazed for quite a while as long as they don't start paying close attention to what your fingers are actually typing.|`|AA10395093	go to the petiton and press the period .. it'll come out as P .<br>  After that, type in you're answer.<br>  After youve typed in you're answer press the period again and finish th petiton if needed.<br>  Finally go to question, type in you're question, and it'll come out as what you typed in the petiton !

geih5vR8aa	Nikki Sixx wrote most of the songs for Motley Crue, and I believe he played bass. Les Claypool of Primus writes all the songs, and he plays bass. Lemmy, from Motorhead writes their songs, and he plays bass.<br>  <br>  What I'm trying to say, is that it's not impossible. If you're hearing a song, and bass is what jumps out at you, well then, you should be a bass player... PLUS, there is always a shortage of good bass players, not to mention vocalists. You can form a band REALLY easy if you're a bass playing singer.<br>  <br>  The only reason people write on guitar, is because vocals are based around the melody of the song... this is where the guitar comes in, because the guitar holds the melody. The bass and drums normally hold the beat.  <br>  <br>  As far as Primus and Motorhead go, the bass a lot of the time is the focal point of the music, so it's easy for them to write to a bass line. It's also what gives these bands their originality too.<br>  <br>  Nikki Sixx on the other hand, writes on guitar I think, then plays bass in the band. That is another option you can think about. Write the music on guitar, but plan on playing bass if you form a band.<br>  <br>  Learn both Bass and Guitar. It will only make you a better musician, and you'll be able to find your niche. <br>  <br>  The way my band does it, we all jam together and come up with the music first, THEN, we think about lyrics, or rather we talk about how we want the lyrics to go, or how the melody should be done... then we write lyrics to the melody.|`|nxZQKmjMaa	i memorize bass lines too. sometimes they are the best part of the song! you can pretty much write songs to any instrument. i saw this one guy perform a song with just a harmonica. and i say another sing a song with the help of a flute. and yes they both wrote their own songs. it just really depends on if your song flows with the instrument you plan use.<br>  <br>  like b.b. king and his sax or beethoven and his piano.

It just did.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Usually she doesnt have many other clothes on either, the kids doing naughty things always die|`|nbG4pGEyaa	cause she wasn't wearing running shoes|`|bhm3Z5zoaa	Because then she looks more innocent and helpless and the viewer thinks, "Oh don't kill her! The poor girl doesn't even have shoes to defend herself with!" and the villain is seen even worse. Its is a girl because generally people see girls as being more helpless / cute / less worthy of death, and the villain is hated even more. Also it's creepy when villains kill innocent things. Did this help? Why do you need to know anyway? Are you writing a horror movie? Oooh!Oooh!Oooh!Oooh! PLEASE write a horror movie!!! I'll buy it and watch it! Please please please with sugar on top??? Well anywho, have an amazing day!    XOXOXOX|`|hnRHjTmzaa	Because by being barefoot she already made herself vulnerable to the killer & us as viewers.. She cannot possibly run faster in the middle of the woods without shoes on than someone WITH shoes...    She was doomed from the start :)
F0IeVJ0Iaa	i have met ppl at the cleveland house of blues  but i know someone who works there so i park beside the tour buses which is pretty easy to meet them outside   a guy from one of my favorite bands actually made out w a girl against the side of our car     also if u park using valet parking u can see their tour buses walk around on the sidewalk behind the bushes where they park...wow i sound like a stalker... anyways if u go past it before the show u will see them there    there is a restuarant down that sidewalk so u wont look like a creeper walking on it... dont go around the other way u WILL get chased by bums    after shows some ppl wait by the tour buses for them to sign stuff    when bands are done playing at the houe of blues there they usually walk down the steps to the left of the stage stay close to that and keep ur eye out for them    there is a guard who will block the door so dont try to go up there just wait for them to come out they always walk around the venue or get a drink    the house of blues is the easiest place to meet them bc once they are done performing they will hang out with fans    they also go to the bar where the stage is.. not the upstairs one    if u eat at the house of blues restuarant u can skip the line for tickets!

qawExNakaa	I like your art, you're good with the whole concept of posing and everything, the only advice I'd give would be to work on the size of the hands and such.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Bale demonstrates what is wrong with Hollywood and it's stars. He is arrogant, abusive and under the delusion that he is a major actor. Frankly, I never liked him as an actor and find him as bland as white bread. He must still be fuming over the fact that Heath Ledger stole The Dark Knight from him and made his acting look pitiful in comparison. Also, Heath is going to win an Oscar for playing the Joker. Bale has rage issues and he feels superior to those he considers "beneath him." What a total tool! I'm glad he's being humiliated in the press. Now he knows how that poor guy on set felt being humiliated.|`|POJNnWhDaa	I don't think I would have yelled that much.. it's really easy to jump to the "what a dick" conclusion, but I'd want to know the whole story. Had this guy been constantly screwing up? I had heard that this was the most intense scene of the movie, and it takes a lot of effort to get "in the zone."   Still, Bale needs to realize even if he was completely right and justified going off like that, he won't get a fair shake, it will only damage his image.    PS screaming inside: I think Mr. Bale clears 8 figures, after Dark Knight.. that's 10 mil for one movie. I could be wrong, first time for everything.. ;-)|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	It was unnecessary and rude of course and I'm sure he realized it afterward - and obviously the kissed and made up or the movie wouldn't be on track - as Bale threatened.     Everyone has had a bad day and has acted inappropriately at one point or another - what's important is how the person deals with it afterwards.     Christian Bale obviously has some issues with managing his anger - there are a lot of people who do (myself included) and though I might not add as many useless adjectives into my tirades - I still get angry sometimes - not always (and it's important to realize that this was one day out of 365) If I do say something out line I always apologize afterwards - did the person recording this get that part? no - obviously not.     I think you need to understand the whole circumstances - and passing judgement on a person's chracter after this incident (and the incident with his mother and sister) is unfair.     This is the Director of Photography who was screwing up - not some sandwich server on the set. He should know his job. You don't walk on a set in the middle of filming - every minute of filming that goes by costs thousands of dollars and one screw up can be costly.     Apparently this was one of the most intense scenes - and Bale is a method actor and it takes a lot to immerse yourself in the scene and the feelings and emotions of the character you're portraying - a long full day of work doesn't necesary help to minimize the stress.   I would be fuming too - but I would definitely have apologized after my rant.|`|FDt7cC8haa	I see nothing wrong in what he did.....  Have you even gotten yelled at for doing something wrong?  Even better, have you ever been yelled at for something that wasn't your fault?      we all have....    Everyone has a bad day...give the guy a break, he is only human|`|UxdjYFJaaa	Me - totally uncalled for.    Even if the guy did something stupid. He's still a human being, and he still deserves respect. Even if he isn't an actor clearing 7 figures for the films he makes.

HENEZQ7Caa	Yes!|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I don't know what day, but its usually in the morning
c31b46d7046d9eab094655368fe0e190aa	Yes. It is an excellent movie, with all the deserved Oscars it was awarded. Ang Lee is a genious who knows how to manage human relations in his movie characters. Heath Ledger is superb, Michelle shows the good actor she always have been, Jake is very handsome, and myu surprise was Anne Hathaway in a very mature and ruthless character. I loved her performance. You must watch this movie.|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	It's totally worth it. I've seen it twice. Brokeback is one of my top 10 favorite movies. The videography is breathtaking, the story is complex, thought-provoking and emotional. The acting is phenomenal. It's a beautiful film.|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	yeah..its pretty good...it sad....|`|tLI94qWNaa	It is an amazing and beautiful movie, everyone should see this movie at least once if not more.  Jake and heaths performances in this movie are pure genius and just mesmerizing.  The movie will make you cry and take your breath away.  Just a beautiful romantic movie that will never leave your thoughts.|`|weMhsZUNaa	Yeah it's a really good movie.   I was watching it with my mum and grandma, they thought it would be a boring movie but they both loved it!|`|wbIEau0qaa	no dont watch it man. it'll get you thinking|`|NyB2HlmGaa	Yeah, its a good movie.  Like others said, its pretty sad though.|`|PyB4MjwCaa	ive heard its a good movie, its not my type (i like horror/action/comedy more)     i might watch sometime actually :-)|`|fs6I4Xleaa	yeah its pretty good|`|p98iQptVaa	It's Great, it's sad though, but I like sad movies.|`|GCsMUrQbaa	I thought it was a pretty good movie.

mKfQQRDuaa	Quite frankly, Gemini is very different from Taurus. Taurus longs for security and likes to possess his partner. Gemini is a social butterfly and enjoys freedom and gets bored very easily. Taurus is loyal and devoted and Gemini does not like heavy emotional relationships. But keep in mind without a complete natal chart for both people, it is difficult to truly say. But the sun signs of Gemini and Taurus are generally not compatible, however Taurus can learn quite a bit from Gemini!|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	theres a lot more to compatibility than sun signs. You must look at venus, mars, the moon and rising signs to really see where you are at. Plus, you have to remember that all these signs are general guidelines, some of which may be broken.
AA12390047	No way.  There's too many people around (cameramen, crew, etc.)  THey didn't even spend the night together.  It's just to make the show more interesting.  That's why she wore his clothes.  Jason is too "up front" for that.  It's cheesy.|`|Ukgl64pSaa	I doubt it.  Do you think they came back to the house and told everyone "WE HAD SEX' ??????????????????????????? come on|`|WgTKHqlnaa	I doubt it, but for his sake, I hope they did.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	i doubt too|`|F93FZyo1aa	i dont think so. if they did then they hid it well, but i doubt it|`|5LxpvXSmaa	No with that many cameras on you i can't see anyone being that desperate to connect on a National network TV program. They both have too much class for that.   Now if it was on VH1.......
456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	I think I spoil my girlfriend (when I am in a relationship, right now I am single by choice) because I buy random things like bracelets, top, skirt, necklace, shoes, cosmetics, handbags.  I will often see things I think looks great and then I buy it randomly knowing she would love it.<br>  <br>  I don't do this early in the relationship though.  I do more things the longer I have been in a relationship with the girl because my feelings develops slowly.  Most guys seem to do LESS the longer they have been in a relationship with a woman, for me it's the other way round.|`|BL4OBp0eaa	if i want something, my boyfriend will buy it for me but its not really a gift cuz i pick it out. he rarely gets me just because gifts, but im never disappointing with my gifts at Christmas and my birthday!|`|JPDxyTT3aa	my husband buys me flowers almost every week and gets me jewelry usually for valentines day. valentines days always suck until you get married. so no worries. it will happen. :)|`|IjKndeVvaa	I don't get my girlfriend anything for Valentine's day, but I do little things for her throughout the year, and I'm basically going all out for her birthday this year.|`|l0opvMfGaa	I do not celeberate valentines day
3Gr79dRCaa	YES!!   Rumor has it, the pact is three-way and it includes Mickey Rourke!|`|oDGttkmLaa	It's more like a secret ingredient. Like on the Iron Chef.

Squid pizza!!! Yummmm. (blech)

He has Michael Jackson's lawyer on his side and we know what happened with that child molestation case...<br>  <br>  See the pattern here?|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	I wish, but I doubt. Besides the obvious reason of him being a celebrity, there isn't enough evidence to put him in jail. The only witnesses are him and Rihanna.

Do you think that to answer your question we have to read the newspaper you provided? Here is your answer to your prime question: My dad expired 15 yrs before. What could be the answer to your question now? Of course I loved my dad more than any other of you, I suppose.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	No. Most people say that you're "supposed to" love your parents, but I just don't love my father. There's a very long and extremely legitimate reason behind it that I just don't feel like going into. <br>  <br>  But on the flip side, I don't hold any hate for him either. I'm very much just indifferent to him and I'm glad he's no longer in my life because I just don't want anything to do with him. When he passes, I really don't know how I'm going to react. I won't be celebrating, but I don't think it'll make me cry either. It's a complicated situation I guess.|`|rtucR0Vhaa	Of course I love my dad|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I loved my dad very much.

I think it comes from she was and is the only one that has ever helped me with school and working and my disability.

NV9FoM5Jaa	That is good( I am guessing he is the AQUARIUS?) that is good your letting him play hard to get,but remember he is willing to hold out on the whole despondent,aloof approach for much longer then you can take it.  It's a great match however Aquarius will never meet the emotional needs an Aries wants,he will throw in bits and pieces of wonderfulness and then he backs off like hes hit the side of a bus with his head and just needs time to think.....oh and think he will......of all sorts of sh*t that is not going on.|`|B7WIZdglaa	Whose birthday is 2/16..?

b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	I watch with my daughter, and this gives me a real wake up on today's teenage reality.    Grace is slightly too good for me, and hopefully she had her wake up call last night.    Adrienne has crossed into my skanky slut category last night; enough sleeping with a guy who got a girl preggers and has a girlfriend who won't put out, but to become involved with her stepbrother!!    The more I think about it, I do agree the baby should be given up for adoption, and Iike the route they're going with the gay couple/employees having him, as Amy's dad said last night, they would be able to keep in touch and see the child grow, but if that happens; where does that leave the show?    And I seriously don't like the Amy realization she still loves Ben; I find it hard to beleive that some guy knocks you up, abandons you, and you still want to be with him? Happened to me in real life, and I don't have any feelings left.|`|uEo0vS7aaa	Amy should give up her son. Realistically, she cannot take care of him by herself. Her mother made excellent points when she stated that Amy would have to get a job and put the baby in daycare in order to keep her son. No, Amy did not plan on getting pregnant, but you have to deal with the reality of what if when these things happen. Some (very few teens or their parents) end  up being able to keep their child and resuming a normal teen life once they have a baby. Most parents of teens are in their late 30's to mid 50's, are very active in their social lives and do not see themselves as stay-at-home Grandparents. Some parents do stay at home and help raise their grandchild, but most are working out of the home and will not quit their job or career to stay home and care for their grandchildren. Grace and Adrianne would be better friends if Ricky was not in the picture. But Adrianne's dad does need to enforce more parental restrictions on her. She made me so mad the other night, that I thought about sending her away to an all-girls boarding school and she is not even my child!! Grace does need to stop living in la la land where everything is perfect and works out.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I think AMy should keep him. Grace is sweet but very naive and Adrianne well, she is a tramp! Her dad needs to step it up and be more of an influence in her life.

jGbNnpDXaa	i LOVEDDDDDDD it like crazy  i grew up watchin bollywood movies with music by A.R. Rahman n i think he's an absolute genious. he's the best there can be. It is my most favorite movie ever, [after GHAJINI, another Indian movie, but bollywood. maybe you should check this movie out with subtitles. it is really good] plus, Dev Patel is soooo cute. he's my new celeb crush, lol. the littlest Jamal is SUCH a cutie. i just want to pinch his cheeks. all the kids did a wonderful job. i watch it all the time.    --yea--  i could go on n on but ill stop here  this movie is AWESOME|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Absolutely awesome.  Danny Boyle channels Sanjit Ray and translates him into English for the Tarantino generation!    Top 3 movies of 2008:  Chop Shop  Slumdog Millionaire  Encounters at the End of the World|`|BJugETlOaa	Very awsome movie one of the best I have seen in awhile!|`|JqhQSjQFaa	brilliant movie, great acting, great story, great script, great movie|`|YJRCC0vbaa	I enjoyed it but my boyfriend didn't like it at all. I don't know if I will buy the DVD when it comes out but I thought it was very powerful and involving. I loved the interaction between the 2 brothers and how their relationship develops. I was more interested in that than in the relationship between Jamal and Latika as it seemed to have more depth. The soundtrack was excellent too.|`|YWmQKm9eaa	I LOVED IT, however, I can't decide which is better, benjamin button or slumdog! I cried in both, and it's kinda the same with the lost love thing. Really romantic. But then, Slumdog kinda makes you think about India, and you just wanna do something for the street kids who are really living like that. And Benjamin is just impossible, but I'd be strange to age backwards.|`|56bNLJykaa	The positives about Slumdog, were the character development, which was subtle, but definitely there, and grasps your sympathy for the main character, Jamaal. The acting was fair, main actor Dev Patel, who plays Jamaal is a bright young actor, who was chosen for this role after being denied numerous times in Bollywood. They also introduce Freida Pinto, who is an exquisite looking woman, and plays a childhood friend of Jamaals who is reunited with him years later. Upon seeing her, like Al Pacino in The Godfather, he is thunderstruck, as well as the audience and myself. Along with the pretty good casting, likeable and interesting characters, we certainly had someone to root for, in this case, the underdog. Once again, the other main positive was the great cinematography, certainly a spectacle of a film to look at, and look forward to it being released on Blue Ray and DVD.   My dislike of the film was the plot, which was simply lazy. Simple can be good, but lazy, is not. In the movie Adaptation, written by the very intelligent screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, one scene is of him and a big shot story-writing lecturer discussing what angles Kaufman could use to finish his film, which he has been stuck on. The instructor says, whatever you do, do not use voice over, and whatever you do, do not throw in a dues ex machina, claiming that both were lazy film making. The ironic and great thing about this film, is that Kaufman did both, and yet managed to do it well. This is sort of the way I feel about Slumdog Millionaire though, who used flashback to tell the entire story, and just presented us with all the facts, no thinking involved.|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	i don't see what all the fuss is about i don't think it's better then Benjamin Button but i am curious to see it so i know what everyone is talking about|`|akcGfgdcaa	Loved the film, more for the direction and story as opposed to the acting. But it was still a great film.|`|HkSSJXE9aa	Great choice , it's gonna be one of my collection, it's a must have for me, the story just made you wanna be a part of it...|`|B1lNqtA3aa	I'm so surprised everyone thought it was so great. I've grown up watching Indian movies all my life, and I thought it was mediocre, at best. There are better ones out there, people, don't wait around until they simply make them English speaking, check out the ones with English subtitles.|`|9u0zbF5haa	Slumdog Millionaire was the best movie I've seen this year! This movie has won so many awards, from best director, best screenplay, best actor and more! It won a golden globe and will hopefully win an Oscar. There is so much to learn from this movie, and it teaches you how their culture lives. Everyone can learn something from this amazing movie.|`|nGNKhYBJaa	Nothing great in tis movie.

IizPFrELaa	Yep!    It will help get rid of the "cradle crap" as we call it, you can also use regular baby shampoo and baby oil afterwards, but the Selsun won't hurt them one bit, just  keep it out of their eyes.|`|VXCCjdZhaa	Not for a baby, the ingredients are too harsh for a baby's scalp, even with cradle cap. And holy hell, it would hurt baby's eyes so bad. Mineral oil is still the safest, most gentle means of clearing it up.|`|8f81c557782db78a6e0cfb5ef1ca75a0aa	What kind of doctor told you this? A vet? I've been a nurse for 23 years and have never heard of doing this. That is way harsh for a baby's scalp.I would use a gentle baby shampoo and baby oil and gently massage the child's scalp. The cradle cap will resolve . I would talk with another pediatrician and think about changing doctors.|`|bNRUjnGZaa	I wouldn't do it, but I'm not a doctor. If you do be very careful of the eyes.|`|o0Badlndaa	well use it but keep out of the eyes .... and mayo enemas are great they are very soothing for an irritated anus ....   mayo is just oil and eggs all beat up .... just fill a turkey baster and insert and squeeze the bulb and voila there you are ready for the salad .....|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well no.|`|mF7uxVmLaa	i would just use lotion. baby oil works best.|`|LBy0PU4laa	NOOOOO get cradle cap shampoo that is safe for babies!  If that gets in his/her eyes it can mess them up!  And cause them pain!!  Get a new doctor!!!|`|krI2fziJaa	That doesn't sound safe. Use baby oil. Gently massage it in his scalp. You can also gently, very gently, scrape the cradle cap off with your finger nails. My boys had bad cradle cap and that's what I did. Softened it up with the oil and then gently scraped. It wasn't real bad, so it came off quickly and easily.|`|xvvlYuNtaa	nope|`|T3LYP0VDaa	mineral oil is better and cheaper|`|xBznZptlaa	No please don't. That shampoo is highly medicated as well as toxic to use on a child. Cradle cap is not a disease, most newborns have it but it does go away. There is no harm in using baby shampoo every time you bathe him. Just try not to be too rough on it because you don't want him to have a sore scalp.|`|AeEnMEgJaa	Word of advice: that guy that deals you smack on the corner is not actually a licensed physician.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	sounds  sensible!!|`|yAXrsQiFaa	nope|`|RwYIhCg8aa	I've NEVER heard that.

Your doctor SCARES me!|`|AA11370204	No, never heard of using any selsun blue shampoo on a baby. I'd use Baby shampoo instead!|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i have not heard of it but im sure ur doctor knows what he/she is talking about so try it just dont get it in ur babies eyes|`|6wzQhsIkaa	It seems to be very harsh for a baby's skin...plus if that got in its eyes!|`|2vw48Whtaa	No...    Don't think that's a good idea.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	No for a baby do not use shampoo  God is to take care and you !|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	NO!!!  OMG NO!!!!!

00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	actually falling over is funny. Watch this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjEOD39tL...|`|AA10025824	If it's me, Nearly is funny enough.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	People almost falling over|`|SbKkgwPQaa	almost falling over. because when they fall over, and you're the only one laughing, you kinda feel like a douche|`|IcNLcTsvaa	hahhaha too funny.  almost because they try to act like it didnt happen and its too funny because of their facial expression|`|fouEsSofaa	Nearly falling is funny but seeing someone actually fall can be hilarious.  I don't know why someone falling is so funny it just is.|`|Qagl7o1Haa	Both.    But I think People actually Falling Over.    xD.|`|B2OYOhIpaa	Nearly, haha i nearly fell over on the stairs in school today XD i laughed so much! =]|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Almost.    People hurting themselves is not really funny. Loss of dignity on the other hand is a great laugh!|`|AAwe5WbVaa	almost :) i agree  because then you get to see people try to stop their falling. but it makes it so much more entertaining.|`|KkSW6EViaa	nearly falling over is much funnier  it's the whole tumbling part of it, then the look of accomplishment on their face when they don't actually fall  lol    :)|`|oB6H3xEfaa	it depends on how bad it is and who it is. if it's like someone falling down while ice skating, and they laugh, it's funny. if a 4 year old falls down on the ice and starts crying, it's not that funny. somebody almost falling is kinda funny, but not really. i woudnt want to fall or even almost fall, cuz i used to do it a lot and got sooo embarrassed. i know its a long answer but i'm just sayin.|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	I'm gunna have to go with nearly.  While falling over is funny, it can sometimes cause injury which obviously isn't funny and can also result it the person you laugh at getting angry cuz they feel silly.  Nearly falling is funny and pain free.  Nearly falling wins :)|`|2vH6VktWaa	My sister slipped on some ice then did the splits and landed flat on her face.  LOL!   ACTUALLY falling over gets my vote! :P|`|Xverqpu4aa	The funniest is when people fall over, but then get up as if nothing happened.|`|wRP932Zzaa	almost man its like so funny manchild!|`|qhU3PDgfaa	almost falling is the funniest!    lmao !!!|`|kzoUGdg0aa	Nearly...Because when they do fall over I wonder if they are hurt.|`|NwMUaHYzaa	my friend fell out of the car this morning while dropping me at school. it made my day because he went down with such a thump in the middle of the road. so actually falling over. :)|`|AA12383908	When they fall. People tend to laugh first then worry if they are hurt or not.|`|223ddd171a5a8fff50d94bbbc612c2a2aa	both are funny, but someone actually falling  makes u laugh harder    edit::: i agree wit the 2nd answerer :)  lol|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Category 3...they slip and slide, but just manage to save it, then as they walk off looking oh so pleased...whoops..down like a ton of bricks.|`|levE5VCpaa	People nearly falling over and then pretending it didn't happen|`|3fe0d36dfe874f978e205152d212f8cbaa	nearly, definitely.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	a little of both|`|HY5K4Yrraa	Almost, because they make a big show of trying not to fall over arms in the air, wide eyed facial expression! Its hilarious! :) ..Well only when it doesn't happen to you!|`|OBW6nzkLaa	when people almost fall over and then actually falls over..xxx.. :]|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Someone who almost falls over but doesn't, acts as if nothing has just happened.....then falls over|`|Dj3w4uCDaa	Both make me laugh like a loon, especially if I'm the one doing the slip, trip and/or fall. Sometimes I just have to lay there and let the laughter go on and on...|`|tfgqHABaaa	lmao...haha..i'm sorry but its gotta be be other people falling over...lol..|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Actually falling over because they get hurt.|`|lmVkN0VVaa	LOL, i did the same thig this morning! so much snow!!   i think when they fall over, i know mean =P  xx xx|`|4VDuphOCaa	when they actually fall. becuase then you can make fun of them :)|`|lRQjLbLhaa	Them falling over. Because they hurt and then laugh about it|`|CY7rPa6oaa	well i think nearly get mine too because then it would be a hell of a lot funnier after u go over the shock but funny all the same and for people watching they get to piss them self even if u do fall over so what the hell xD|`|JmdnlQsHaa	people almost falling over a few times before actually falling over|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Neither.  Both make me wince, and I just don't understand how people can laugh at the misfortune of others...perhaps because I have permanent knee injuries from a bad fall, and two surgeries, and am in constant pain, and that has colored my outlook...but I just see nothing funny in people falling down, whether or not they get physically hurt.    It is embarrassing to be sprawled out on the ground with everyone staring...would you want people to gawk and laugh if it were you?|`|7zVvAzJCaa	Good point actually, I think it's funnier when people nearly fall over.  If they actually fall over you feel bad for them incase they've hurt themselves.|`|tcVm5HWgaa	Nearly|`|AgxtBVwoaa	Almost is funnier, Definitely|`|CBNC40sDaa	Neither.  People being hurt is not funny.|`|JOAPnhOgaa	nearly so u know they didnt hurt themselves :)|`|7sFNyeOhaa	Actually. Because if you fall and laugh at yourself, it won't be as funny to the spectators, but if you get angry it will make it more funny to me. If you actually fall you won't have as much of a reason to find it funny. If you trip without falling, you'll be more able to play it off.

I still can't believe she slept with Billy!!|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	brandee is correct. she is the new brooke.  but sharon has always been a whore...i used to like her, but now I pity her|`|3xOKvjzDaa	its a soap opera .. who hasnt slept with more than one person. and shes single, so its whatever. what do you except?|`|uVwPykXlaa	a part of it yea we shuld.<br>  she felt so guilty the morning after when nick told her ,he indeed remmeber their annivesary.<br>  she slept with billy coz she was hurt and feeling low,...but no xcuse for opening yo legs to the highest bidder.<br>  hahaha
yorfmfiBaa	My crappy school can't afford Mac! lol     I forgive you for the misspelling, you're probably a tech geek and they can't spell worth a damn. :)|`|ZLWswKHHaa	Most schools use PCs because they're more customizable. Most art schools use Macs because they have better graphic design something blah blah (never used a Mac). Otherwise, your school could have some contract/deal with one or the other.|`|krAOUctaaa	Mine used to be like 90% PC, but its really turning around.

I'm more familiar with how to use it & MACs seem kind of pretentious haha|`|Tz55X4s5aa	My school is 100% Mac cuz i guess they get a discount or something.|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	99% PC|`|3yNh5jO8aa	college was PC|`|4Aauh87yaa	You go to "collage" but can't spell college.

He is not going to die.|`|cei3Xnn3aa	I bet something will go wrong with the pregnancy.|`|MY9FlL8vaa	this show isn't like most, it doesn't have the guts to do it|`|IuDWWYTDaa	If someone dies I think it will be either Ben's dad or Amy's dad.<br>  There's also a possibility that there could be complications with the pregnancy and the baby dies.<br>  I reallly hope that doesn't happen though.|`|AA11897739	I personaly think that no 1 will die at least i hope not. I love the show but i think if any 1 will die it will b ricky's father if he get out of prison.|`|TTt51jutaa	I heard that the show will eventually get canceled.|`|Um0n7Uzxaa	I don't think it'll b George cuz we still have to find out about the money he "spent".

tG4Jxcmeaa	Lmao nobody gives a sh*t about Rage Against The Machine    Nothing is wrong with them, but stating them as you are like they're some type of idol is ridiculous, you won't get props from rock fans just because you listen to them.    Al Green  Bob Marley  Britney Spears = honourable mention with her early work  The Eagles  Elton John  Etta James  Eminem  James Brown  Jay-Z  Jimi Hendrix Experience  Johnny Cash  John Lennon  Marvin Gaye  Michael Jackson  Nirvana  Phil Collins  Pink Floyd  Prince  Queen  Roberta Flack get's mad props  Run-D.M.C.  Sting  The Police  2pac    That's just what I gathered off of my iPod, there are many many more though    To name RATM as a legendary group though is laughable, they're like an upmarket Linkin Park    Like I said, nobody gives a sh*t about RATM, they haven't done enough to be worthy of being regarded in the same category as people like Bob Marley. If you knew the slightest about music you would know that Britney Spears literally blew up pop music and paved the way for so many other new artists. Her style was fresh and new, and she has sold over 85 million albums. Everybody can acknowledge her for her skills and what she has acomplished, she is known world wide, I doubt very much in India they know who RATM are, but I'm damn sure everyone on the planet knows who Britney Spears is, now apart from screaming their lungs dry what has RATM managed to do? Think logically    Okay you're slowly going off topic, this is about artists who get respect in all genre's, and Bob Marley was used an as example, so I followed on from there. To gain respect you need to have accomplished something, which she has displayed in many ways. You obviously couldn't understand that as you went talking about underwear and the New York Stock exchange. I thought we were talking about musical influence and impact, not some sort of wannabe revolutionary band that scream at the top of their lungs for some strange reason. But why do you keep talking about Britney Spears? Sure she may not be the most strongest of candidates, but why do you think I wrote in a side note "honourable mention for her early work". Should we move on to say, The Eagles? Al Green? Sting?|`|PaxBFdS1aa	Michael Jackson and U2|`|sUNUiJzDaa	the beatles|`|6GbyhpTMaa	RUN  DMC|`|6fxr3VBGaa	Stevie Wonder|`|NzkPEKYgaa	U2|`|G05rllkBaa	Rage Against The Machine.    Edit: Obviously not. Whats wrong with Rage?  Edit: lol @ Penguin. Evidently.  Edit: I'm not trying to get any props I just like them and I know people on here who do to, like Cap for instance. They are a great band Tom Morello is a great guitarist and Zach De La Rocha is a great rapper. So therefore they get respect from different genres.    Edit: I'm not labeling them as a legendary group. Was that the question? No. I'm labelling them as a group who get respect in all genres. Dude you named Britany Spears, thats laughable.    Edit:You could have an argument in an empty room I never said anything about them being in the same catergory as Bob Marley, but then again neither is Britany Spears.  She never wrote any of her own music and selling records dosen't = respect, she doesn't even respect herself enough to wear underwear. If you knew anything about music you would know that Tom Morello is regarded as one of the best guitarists of his generation and he has directly influenced and revolutionised the use of guitar effects to create new and unique sounds. He also ranked  26 on Rolling Stones 100 greatest guitarists of all-time. RATM are also political and social activists and have done a great deal to help shed light on various human rights issues around the world. They also protested and played outside the New York Stock exchange to which it had to be shut down, has Britany Spears ever had that kind of impact? Think logically.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	ray charles  marvin gaye|`|gPuASwcWaa	The Beatles.  Elvis Presley.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Bob Marley is definitely the best answer.

C0b6q7hiaa	Yes...couldn't afford the golf villas, but stayed at a pretty cheapo place, hung out with some college age people.  Good times, great weather, but they eat tourists alive, so be careful unless you are already well travelled.  They won't do that at the Golf VIllas, but it costs extra fee hundred a day to stay away from where most Fijians live.|`|wzue5Xzbaa	I haven't.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	no I like cold weather|`|AA11280367	I've been to Fiji many times and always enjoyed it. The "best" place to stay depends on you. The most popular areas among tourists are the Mamanuca Islands off Nadi and the Coral Coast along the south coast of Viti Levu. That's where you'll find most of the large resorts such as the Warwick and they aren't cheap. Since you asked about costs, I assume that's important to you. You can save money by staying at backpacker resorts you book upon arrival in Fiji. The largest number of such resorts is in the Yasawa Islands which are serviced daily by a fast catamaran from Nadi. But there are such places all around Fiji and most are listed in guidebooks like Moon Fiji. They cost anywhere from $50 Fijian to $100 Fijian a night depending on whether you're staying in a dormitory or thatched bure (hut). They'll need a couple of weeks to really get a taste of Fiji....|`|LgNqYUECaa	Never went, I've been to kyoto before last last christmas it was amazing I did like, and It cost I think my uncle paid for him and I, ￡1100, I think something around that.|`|mYeq5AvFaa	no|`|oKGTdDVcaa	Heya,  Yup been a couple of times and looking forward to heading back again in May this year.<br>  <br>  Fiji is an absolutely wonderful place to holiday!  The locals are friendly and welcoming, the scenery is beautiful and the weather awesome!<br>  <br>  I've stayed at The Sheraton Denerau (very expensive - thanks to a work conference) and at the Warwick Resort.  We highly recommend the Warwick if you're wanting a relaxing holiday.<br>  <br>  Take a look for yourself <a href="http://www.warwickfiji.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.warwickfiji.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you are venturing into the cities however, it is best to go with a guide, as some of the locals can be a little "pushy" to sell you stuff.  Lol - one of the tricks is to invite you into their shops for a Kava ceremony, and then not let you leave until you've bought something.<br>  <br>  All in all though, it is a truely amazing place.<br>  <br>  Its hard to say how much it costs - our last trip was $5000.00 for 6 nights, all meals included, but we're in NZ.  Best to ask your local travel agent - and try and get an all-meals inclusive package, it makes life much easier.<br>  <br>  Hope you go and enjoy!|`|h3MmXV9Caa	no but the water cost me 2 dollars at a gas station lol!\

aQCF1pqIaa	You are correct!!!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes, it was her cousin BJ Jones. She was in a school bus accident leaving her brain dead. BJ's dad was Tony Jones and Maxie's was Frisco Jones making them cousins and a suitable match.She was named for Bobbie who delivered her but her mother was Tania Jones, Tony's late first wife. Bobbie and Tony developed a friendship that turned to love and they married and Bobbie adopted her name sake.|`|AA12315431	Yes it was her cousin Barbara Jean who was brain dead after a school bus accident and her heart was a match for Maxie like it was meant to be or something. I have never cried so much watching a soap as I did when that happened. Felicia, Bobbie, and Tony were all fabulous but when Felicia broke down after she found about BJ and her heart going to Maxie, she should have won a daytime Emmy for that. It was truly heart wrenching.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	It happened in 1994 and it was a bus accident that killed Maxi's cousin BJ. Brad Maule who played BJ father Tony Jones was nominated for Best Actor that year. it was so heart wrenching that i sit here 15 years later and am starting to cry. <br>  Two things i will never forget about that episode. Tony coming in to Maxi's room after the transplant and just bending down listening to the heart that was just donated from his daughter to his niece - no words in that scene was needed too powerful a performance,<br>  The other was the jubilation on Felicia's face ( Maxi's Mom played by Kristina Wagner) when they found a donor for her daughter and the distraught on that same face moments later when she found out it was her niece BJ heart. Again no words<br>  <br>  just look on youtube for BJ Heart and it will bring you to tears.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	I wasn't watching then, but one episode Maxie was talking all about it with Nikolas. Her cousin BJ's heart was donated to Maxie when BJ died. So now Maxie is like obsessed with it, so now, whenever something threatens her heart, she refuses to get a new heart, because it's BJ's. That's all I know.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!!! :P|`|ADBMrG87aa	You're absolutely right!  It was her cousin Barbara Jean Jones aka BJ in a school bus accident.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|7XM4QJiuaa	That's right.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	You got it right.  Her name was BJ Jones (Barbara Jean Jones), daugther of Tony Jones and his then wife, Bobbie (Barbara Jean) Spencer-Jones.  She was about the same age as Maxie, give or take a year maybe, and she died in a school bus accident.  It turns out her heart was a perfect match for Maxie and that's how Maxie ended up w/BJ's heart.<br>  <br>  You should check out those scenes on You Tube.  Felicia, Bobbie, Tony turned in some of the most powerful preformances I've ever seen on GH.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	You are right it was Maxie's cousin B.J. Jones.  Maxie Jones was dieing and needed a heart transplant.  Her cousin B.J. was in a school bus accident by a drunk driver.  B.J. was killed and her parents gave B.J. heart to Maxie.  Tony, B.J. dad listened to B.J. heart in Maxie and this moment helped GH win emmy's and still know as the most loving and caring moment in GH's history and soap opera history.|`|EhBF31evaa	It was Bobbi and Tony's daughter, BJ, Maxie's cousin.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	It was Bobby's son/daughter (can't remember which) BJ, her cousin.|`|GWV89XK8aa	It was BJ.

Yeah, I think so.   7) I don't listen to much. I like rock, but not so much metal. I don't mind som of Mike Patton's work.   8) Mostly. Sometimes not.     Bonus Q - You're complaining about her liking porn? Hmmm.     Bonus Q 2 - Sh saw in in her stolen porn collection and thinks it's sexy.    edit: I will NEVER admit it!|`|q4XUy0Duaa	1. Atmosphere - Always coming back home to you  2. Raekwon  3. Phrenology  4. R.A. (He's a beast with the flows).  I think Vinnie Paz has a more distinct voice though.  5. Rugged, but presentable.  6. Ghostface (One of my favorite emcees).  7. Metal's not bad.  One of my boy's is always puttin me on to new stuff, but I'm bad with names so I don't know about a favorite.  8. Yeah, I like a lot of your comments, especially when it comes to beats, because you get real specific.    Bonus Question - Definitely catch her in the act.  She might be doing it to get caught.  You can tell a lot about a girl (sexully) by the type of porn she watches.    Bonus Question 2 - I had a chick who used to like slapping ME in the ***, and I didn't like it.  I would just hit her back harder.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	1. Slug (not fair cuz he's my fav and this happens to be one of my fav songs)  2. E  3. Phrenology  4. Vinnie  5. I like clean shaved but not hairless.

Bonus 2: Not me and you shouldn't hit a female with your hands, na'mean?|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	1)Atmoshpere  2)Raekwon  3)Phrenology  4)Ruggedman on both accounts (raps about his Vietnam Vet father and his brother max who died at the age of 10. Then Stanley Kubrick?)  5)Unfortunately clean (although for the REAL corporate look, The Satan's Stache and Goatee would be perfect). I work at McD's so I rock the permanant 5 o'clock shadow  6)It's possible. They still have Priest, Nas, Ruggedman, Vinnie Paz, Immortal Technique, and other like MCs to contend with, but I say yes.  7)Sometimes Black Sabbath and Annclarity are my favorites  8)I'm kinda disappointed in you for not including RZA in your top 10 producers a moment ago. . .|`|zVdNQowNaa	1.Atmosphere  2.Raekwon, but Eazy is cool  3.Phrenology  4.R.A.

I think you're one of the smarter people on here.    Wait to catch her in the act, it'll be super weird if you're wrong.    I don't know.  Try and take more control?|`|9wUrbqT3aa	1. Rhymefest  2.

It hurts when our heart is broken. While writing this piece I'm reminded of an old time favourite Irish melody "The Water is Wide" in which two verses of the lyrics I have included here.  <br>  <br>  "Oh love is gentle, love is kind. Gay as a jewel when first it's new. But love grows old and waxes cold, and fades away like the morning dew."<br>  <br>  We need to accept that not all relationships end happily every after. Below are signs that a heart is about to be broken. Humor helps alleviate pain.  For the sake of simplicity, 'he' is used instead of the tedious 'he/she.'<br>  <br>  When he says ... I need more space.  He really means ...  I want to be with her most of the time.  <br>  <br>  When he says ... I need some time to think things over.  He really means ... I can't keep her out of my mind. <br>  <br>  When he says ... I want to be by myself.  He really means ... I can't be with both of you at the same time.<br>  <br>  When he says ... I'm the one who's to blame.  He really means ...  Please just release me. <br>  <br>  When he says ... We're just not suited to each other.  He really means ... She's 15 years younger than you. <br>  <br>  When he says ... We've simply drifted apart.  He really means ... I no longer enjoy being with you.<br>  <br>  When he says ... This has nothing to do with you.  He really means ... It's her, she got me hooked.  <br>  <br>  When he says ...  You'll find somebody better.  He really means ... You'll find someone much better.  <br>  <br>  When he says ... There'll never be anyone else like you.  He really means ... I'm myself when I'm with her. <br>  <br>  "I leaned my back against an oak. Thinking it was a trusty tree. But first it bent and then it broke. So did my love proved false to me." <br>  <br>  Everybody hurts ....................

If so, I'm sure there will be other ways of watching it non-3D later on. NBC will post a non-3D version for those of us without the glasses.|`|MeGazyy7aa	Yeah.

pLPKo6mBaa	Scarlett pretty much said it all, great answer. <br>  <br>  I don't know about the older songs, but there's a few demos of the songs from Dark Passion Play where Marco sang, presumably because they hadn't had Anette yet. I know he's done "Amaranth" (I think it was called "Reach") and "Eva". Youtube 'em.<br>  <br>  Also here's a guy doing "Sleeping Sun". Eh...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbmPRt7L8lE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbmPRt7L8...</a><br>  <br>  It would be interesting to hear a trained man sing them, but I'm thinking I'd rather listen to the originals. :P|`|4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	There should be many power metal vocalists who can reach high vocals. there are some who have a wider vocal range than Tarja [not to mention Anette].<br>  <br>  Just chech out Helloween's Michael Kiske, Angra's Eduardo Falaschi, Luca Turilli and Stratovarius' Timo Kotipelto. Rob Halford has a lot of potential too, but I honestly wouldn't want to hear him sing Nightwish songs.

2zxnj1Knaa	Let me start off by saying I'm 33 and have never been infatuated with an actor - musicians yes, but never an actor... until I stumbled upon an episode of Doctor Who on BBC America one evening while channel surfing... [D R O O L!]  My husband is a big fan of Top Gear and I've watched it quite a bit myself so I'm also pretty familar with Hammond.    Here's my analysis (LOL!):    Both have similar bone structure  Both have 'large-looking' eyes but for different reasons - Tennant has piercing brown EYES while Hammond has brown eyes on protruding EYEBALLS... B I G difference there folks!  Tennant is long and lean and proportioned (his thumbs look like my index fingers!).  Hammond is short(er) and stubby-LOOKING.  Not that he's as short as the media makes him out to be but he simply LOOKS short because his body is somewhat disproportionate.  Tennant is only two years younger than Hammond but Tennant is 'aging gracefully' (think laugh lines/crow's feet) while Hammond simply looks like he's getting old and kinda saggy.    So I guess to stop beating 'round the bush I'd say that they have similar facial structure... but that's it.    One last thought... Hammond looks kinda sorta NOT masculine enough imho... that's not the same as saying he looks feminine - just not masculine.  Tennant, on the other hand, looks very masculine to me.    Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go wipe the drool off. LOL!|`|WMrNa3Doaa	I love David Tennant also. I didn't know who the other guy was,(I'm in the US, so I'm not up on all my Brits) so I googled him.  I think they share a similarity, like they could be related, but I wouldn't say they "look alike".  David is way hotter!    Also, you know who I think is hot? John Barrowman from Torchwood.  I know he's gay and all, but that doesn't stop me from drooling over him!|`|eHBunhoQaa	Yes, they don't look alike!! :)|`|RcmdFIyyaa	I love them both too. I liked David Tennant first and then started watching Top Gear and became more interested in Richard Hammond. They look alike because    1) They're cool  2) David Tennant is 37 and Richard Hammond is 39  3) They both have the same hair, eyes and face shape      They look completely different because    Of their height  David is quite a bit thinner and is scottish (no problems there though! LOL)

135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	From songfacts.com (which is a great site for this kind of stuff):    Petty has not said what this is about, but there are 2 common interpretations. It could be about Petty's divorce from his wife Jane, which happened a year before this was recorded. Another possibility is that it is about marijuana, as "Mary Jane" is slang for pot and the lyrics refer to killing the pain, which the drug is known for. Campbell offered this explanation: "My take on it is it can be whatever you want it to be. A lot of people think it's a drug reference, and if that's what you want to think, it very well could be, but it could also just be a goodbye love song."|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	It is actually about mans need for acceptance and our inability to fully separate from our mothers. Also, it is a social commentary about genocide and existentialism.      Seriously, I thought it was about pot, but only Petty knows.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Let me see if I can find the question that came up recently where this was discussed. If memory serves me correctly there were some insights...    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|VeYbalAjaa	Definitely about marijuana. He is using a lot of metaphors and personification. Just listen to it a few times; one time for each possible interpretation. Then, you can decide if you agree.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Basically, it means whatever you want it to.    Stoners always say it is about marijuana because that is what they like to think.    I've always thought it was more about giving something you love up, be it a drug addiction or a woman.  Part of what makes this song great is just wondering what he really means here.  The lyrics just seem to lean towards just moving on from time to time, but that is just my opinion.
JNcbYYoraa	Definitely one of my favorite movies. My favorite is when Seth says "Well Jules, the funny thing about my back is that that it's located on my ****!"|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	I was expecting it to be much funnier with all the hype around it.

I only love to watch it because of mclovin:D lol  Ok, so it was a funny movie but I think it is a little overrated if you ask me.  There are by far funnier movies then this one.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	I think its a typical Teenage boy film nothing to original it was funny def not one of my favorites|`|27dsbJKbaa	Soo funny!!!|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	it was ok|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	It was okay, there were 1 or 2 hilarious parts in it but other than that I thought it was just way too stupid and immature.

89512b4a439d6f311cd06b16d97c9b22aa	Let me know! but i was thinking "grand torrino",  but then my husband mentioned a movie called "red" where some teenagers kill a mans dog and he goes after the teenagers so i am not sure which you mean.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	Maybe "Gran Torino" .|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood?|`|nYgUfUd7aa	Gran Torino starring and directed by Clint Eastwood.|`|707802d08077ed6fa1e3d68133b4a34eaa	that's   Gran Torino   with Clint Eastwood|`|NGvJtXnyaa	Gran Torino    **CARMA**|`|AA10331437	I believe that the movie is called "Gran Torino" and it has been out since the middle of December.  It stars Clint Eastwood and it has been getting very good reviews.  Although it is a typical "Make My Day" type movie it has a surprise ending.      Try and go see it if you get a chance.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	"Gran Torino" and I think that's one I really want to see!    I saw the preview when I saw "Doubt" (another excellent movie).
XJRYAhZVaa	I completely agree. It seems like every season they get chicks who are more fake looking with trailer trash attitudes than the previous chicks. In the end, most guys want a chick who has some intelligence and doesn't go around berating other girls and giving threats to beat them up. So I know he isn't going to stay with the girl he picks especially if he is still with Amber. Most importantly these chicks just want to get "famous" and be on TV. I doubt any of them truly find him attractive and want to be with him especially since a lot of them are still young. Come on, man.<br>  <br>  They always cast "beautiful" girls who have loud mouths and are willing to fight someone. All of that causes drama and higher rantings. <br>  <br>  To me, a true rocker would never do a show like this so I know it's completely the chance for him to have his name back in the media/public and the chance to get more money AND the chance to screw more "hott" chicks. I know he said this is his last season and...I really hope it is.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i think they all do it for a little extra cash and for more publicity|`|OilQvoLZaa	Well, duh. He's an old, ugly, Motley Crue wannabe who can't sing for s**t. Ever notice that all the VH1 dating shows run for 3 seasons? It's called a "contract".|`|ad5e6c5fee050b568ce557b6be57d2bfaa	Bret Michaels is in it for the big bucks, absolutely!  This show is a complete hoax, in my opinion.  Bret probably has a contract with VH1 to "find love", but it's so obvious that he's in it for the money and publicity.  Bret Michaels is a has-been.  He makes me sick by kissing all those women.  The latest batch of skanks who think they "love" Bret are a joke.  I've never seen so much silicone!|`|DJo0E2I2aa	absolutely he's doing this for extra money, Brett Michaels is a complete sell-out, as a big poison fan i'm disgusted to see he sold out to VH1's celebreality garbage|`|mIUjnujeaa	I don't think he did it as much for the money as he did for the publicity... Poison wasn't as big as they once were but there was a WIDE fan base for reality love stories.|`|89b9757c9149396d601abc8908671891aa	There is no way alot of these reality "dating" shows are legit.  It's more for the entertainment of the audience and the fame for the cast.  Flavor Flav was the one the kicked off these kind of shows, he had about 3 seasons or so, while had a woman at home pregnant.  However the publicity, kept him relevant.  That's basically what Bret Micheals is doing...money and publicity.  The cast is picked on how wacky the person is, normal people would not make the cut (because they are not entertaining enough)....these shows are dubbed "reality" but truth is as real as the Jerry Springer Show.  You take it as face value and nothing more.

I love every movie he has been in, and have seen most of them.  Also a runner would be James Franco.  I think he is also a really good actor, and he isn't bad to look at either.<br>  <br>  Leading Female: Depending on the type of movie, my first pick would be Zooey Deschanel just because she is kind of different, but can sing and act.  Also for a serious role I would choose Rachel Weisz.  I think she is brilliant.|`|iG2lU8Iyaa	Bill Kaulitz, Tom Kaulitz, David Hasselhoff, barack obama, pete burns and pete bennett<br>  <br>  because i would love to see how these people get along<br>  they are at the oppostite sides of the personality meter :P<br>  <br>  pete burns is a trans-something or other<br>  david hasselhoff is hilarious<br>  pete bennett has tourettes and HES A WANKAA :P<br>  barack obama coz he is the president of america xD<br>  bill kaulitz coz he is the most beautiful thing that happened to this planet. -in my opinion-<br>  tom kaulitz- because bill would die without him<br>  <br>  leading male- Bill kaulitz<br>  <br>  leading female- me?? im sorry i couldn't help but pick myself<br>  -tehe-<br>  <br>  story line-<br>  <br>  They fall in love and get married :P simple and cliche...|`|IuDWWYTDaa	female- Eva Longoria Parker (because she's funny and beautiful, and a really good actress. I love everything she's been in.)<br>  <br>  male- Brody Jenner ( I know he doesn't really act, he does reality shows. But if he ever did act I would choose him because he's really hott.)|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	Phillip Seymour Hoffman because hes an awesome actor and because he did great and the movies both True West (2000), Long Day's Journey into Night (2003).<br>  <br>  <br>  he was in the movie Boogie Nights which was a very low rating movie adn sort of in my opnion made him look bad|`|jlhEQY2Xaa	Well it totally depends on the movie, but meh, I think I'd choose Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. I think they are the most talent actors in their generation. They were already in a movie together (Finding Neverland)!|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	Just a simple movie with Beyonce as a porn star.  Naked all the time, of course.  Yeah, that would be my plot.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Leading Male: Shia LaBoeuf- Shia is the man, and all of his movies have been good lately. Plus Shia is the man.<br>  <br>  Leading Lady: Bryce Dallas Howard- Shes beautiful and can actually act, plus I would believe her dating Shia in a movie.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	If the movie were about me or just a general movie?<br>  <br>  I would choose Angelina Jolie for the woman character. She's a strong woman and a great actor, with a great personality. She's been through a lot but still succeeds. If just a general movie, I would choose Hillary Swank.<br>  <br>  Not so sure about a male character. I like Will Smith, though he has no qualities that portray my life. If it were just a general movie, Seth Rogan. I love him.<br>  <br>  How about just a movie with Seth Rogan and Will Smith? That would go together better than the rest. Both are hilarious.

FBz0iIUXaa	Actually, i'm pleased with this season. Last season it felt like it was the same thing, Amy got pregnant and Ben was there for her. This season, a lot of different things are happening, which is really good. Next week will be the turning point of the show. Amy will realize she loves Ricky and vice versa. Ben will be crushed. I feel bad for Ben, because he is such an amazing guy, who deserves someone better. Amy is such a fool for not allowing Ben to be involved. How many guys agree to raise someone else's baby? Not many. As far as Grace, I would really like for her to get back with Jack. She is such a great person to even think of being with Ricky.|`|TKZAYJokaa	i still feel bad for ricky cause he has a lot of issues so its kinda not his fault. i think in the end he will be with eirther Grace or Adrien, however I prefer him with Adrien cause Grace is just too goody goody. plus no matter what anyone says sex does bring up feelings and adrien loves him and he probably cares for her too or he wouldnt keep going back. i doubt amy and ricky will get together, the preveiw makes it seem like they will but i think when she said "but i really love him" she was really saying she loves the baby (its a boy remember) and will decide against adoption. but who knows i rather that than see the baby get adopted. thats what makes me mad right now. i think Amy should grow up already. do what has to be done to raise the baby herself and face her responsibility. if she ends up giving the baby away ill prob stop watching. and as a mom i hate the fact that her mom is trying to talk her into it. My god, its her grandchild, her blood why would she prefer her daughter give it away. God forbid my daughter ever got pregnant but if she did you can be dam sure she'll be raising it, with me at her side.|`|9zMC6EBtaa	I have liked the show since the very first episode, I do think it moves a little slow though. It seems like every single character is back and forth every single episode and they can never make up their minds. I do like the show, but I did not care for the episode last night. It made me really mad when Amy was acting so mean towards Ricky and feeling so sorry for herself. She was acting as if she was the only pregnant 15 year old in the entire world. It did take the 2 of them to get pregnant, and it seems like she blames it solely on Ricky. I don't think she's going to give the baby up for adoption either. I think she is going to decide at the end that she wants to keep the baby.

8q5SeYueaa	They can afford good lawyers. It's not their celebrity status, it's their income. The judges aren't up their star struck, eager to let them go. It's that their lawyers know how to work the system.<br>  <br>  I've been to court and seen a regular citizen get away with drunk driving because that person had a good lawyer. But you don't hear about the regular citizens who get away with their charges because regular people don't make the TMZ headlines.<br>  <br>  By the way, plenty of celebrities do not get away with their criminal charges. For example, Michael Vick was convicted of the dog fighting crime he committed. Tommy Chong was convicted for some GLASS, not even drugs. And Martha Stewart was convicted for tax evasion.<br>  <br>  But yes, we often hear about all the celebs who get away with their crime. Still, as I said, we simply never hear of all the regular people, especially the rich regular people, who get away with their crimes as well.|`|AA10097817	All criminals tend to get off easy the first and second time around.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Money, and the fact that they're famous helps.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	I think you've got your answers...|`|UD3fFSKBaa	Money, money and lots of it, the law system would look at celebs as a cash cow, celebs pay thousands maybe more  to post bail, normal citizens can't pull $100,000 or more out of their pockets, money buys freedom, it's not fair but thats the truth.|`|oOMWYEyaaa	siimple ...<br>  <br>  MONEYYY !! like they say money talks, but sooner or later it gets to them, ask OJ Simpson, after what 10 years or so, JUSTICE IS SERVED !!!|`|uSwtMWb7aa	because they bribe their way out,|`|4w9gmvumaa	Ask O.J.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	money talks ...<br>  <br>  I think it's very unfair.

HA8bxrLTaa	Yes, I have taken instant dislike to people before. There is just something that strikes you as "ohhhh yeah, NO--we would NOT get along, you and I..."|`|XwFGg5wPaa	yes I met many a person and just took one look at them and the hate has set in. I know it sounds really bad of me. Sometimes it's just the voice that bugs me.|`|owTKIOyxaa	no, hate is converted from your mind after you see the persons personality. I believe in disliking someone at sight, because of how they look! =)|`|oPSO1jRdaa	Not actually...but yes few things are a turn off....!!<br>  <br>  Its not hatred at the first sight with the person....its the turn off...!!|`|LDa3Xda4aa	Yes i do,but most times you are usually wrong.|`|sObEb6NNaa	Hate would be a strong word. But, first impressions are very real.|`|j9meGM9saa	never judge a book by its cover... or somethin like that...|`|I13rHn1Waa	no....i donot believe on that.....|`|Bi51WJd7aa	I don't hate, that's an intensely harsh word... <br>  Yes, I have disliked someone immediately after meeting them. It's so weird and feels like it's completely out of my control - I feel guilty sometimes ha ha. It hasn't happened very often though. and I TRY to get to know someone or understand them first before I 'have an opinion' about them.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	yes some people instantly rub me the wrong way|`|Yj7kMfv7aa	I don't do Hate... Hate is too strong of a word... but yes it has only happened once...to a person I had met for the first time. I took an instant dislike to him, I do not know why I reacted that way and he probably is an awesome guy, but it was something about him that turned me icy cold??? O_o<br>  <br>  I am not usually like that with people and I believe in love at first sight more... ?|`|2qW1Q9fZaa	lol Nopee...I mean I do believe in first impressions and all, for example if I see someone being really rude or disrespectful, I wouldn't want him/her to be my buddy lol but if I just look at someone well then I cant hate them..unless they're giving me a really dirty look lol<br>  <br>  what about you?|`|1b99e2172d8e187dc1c01f1f61578326aa	Yes - I've met a couple of people who you just know are t*ssers right off.

No make-up, though.<br>  <br>  I care about my appearance in that I like to look smart and presentable, like every man usually does, but not out of vanity. I see men checking themselves in every window reflection they walk by and I think it makes them look ridiculous. So I'm probably a 6/7 on your appearance scale.|`|IjKndeVvaa	I've used hair gel before, not on a regular basis though. <br>  Cologne, I guess that would be considered a beauty product.<br>  <br>  Probably about 6 or 7, not in the sense that I go out of my way so people find me attractive and I care so much about what people think, but I do like to take care of myself, and it's nice to look nice every once and a while.|`|T2o9ptUlaa	My boyfriend wears a bit of concealer on hickeys or pimples before large work meetings or whatever.|`|vpZJ6rZzaa	Yep, I wear lipstick, mascara, and everything that makes me pretty. :D|`|JsfSS1o8aa	hell no i use shower gel and deodorant.   make up for men thats mad <br>  they will be wearing dresses next and drinking Bacardi|`|14A10JcLaa	I put Victoria's Secret Moisturizer on my gloriously slick dome.|`|urCM5bP6aa	Yes. 10.|`|O5DYVwTNaa	no 1

Slumdog was excellent, I think it will win.  Also check out Encounters at the End of the World and Man on Wire, those are some very entertaining documentaries, better than most of the fictional movies that came out in 2008.|`|lCRJRoc9aa	the bucket list  martian child  the family that preys  fireproof    and those are the best

AELyrv7Maa	I want my life partner to be possessive about me, but to a certain extent...I dont want him to stop me from doing everything but his reasons to stop me should be reasonable...

uYGdpD9Aaa	Billy's still trying to figure out what Janine's master plan involves and when he turns up at the club for work, he walks into the office to find a less-than-impressed Jack still chained to the radiator. Realising that Janine could have something to do with Jack's overnight incarceration, Billy reluctantly unlocks the handcuffs. At that moment, Jack grabs him and demands to know where Janine is. Taking Jack to the flat, Billy breathes a sigh of relief when Janine's nowhere in sight. Despite the lack of Janine's presence, Jack bursts in, hunting for the incriminating audio file.    Billy's furious when Jack grabs Janet's book from the shelf and demands that e leave it alone. Thinking of his own daughter, Jack is momentarily silent until the phone breaks his thoughts  it's Janine. In an effort to throw her off his scent, Jack sees that the only way to push Janine away is to ignore her. However, this only serves to fuel her determination. Later, Christian turns up at R&R to set up for a party and mentions a video message to Jack over the phone. Realising Janine's next move, Jack rushes back to the club and pulls the plug on the projector in the nick of time. Dragging her outside, Janine reveals that R&R isn't her goal any longer  and Jack agrees to give her what she wants    Meanwhile, Jane and Masood's attempts to avoid each other prove fruitless and Christian thinks the situation's hilarious. A smug Ian walks in and makes a snide comment about the difficulties of running a successful business. However, he's knocked off his high horse when Jane revealed that they have the Gazette party to cater for. Later, Jane and Christian meet with Masood and Zainab to discuss the working arrangements. Ian tries to gatecrash the meeting, but it quickly stopped in his tracks. In preparation for the Gazette party, Zainab laces Jane's Shepherd's Pie with chili. The battle lines are drawn and the catering war commences.    Elsewhere, Denise is relieved that Patrick's not leaving, but Patrick's initially not pleased with the new living arrangements; Linda sees Walford as her home and still hasn't told Jane and Ian about her husband's letter; Ian takes advantage of a moping Billy; and Bradley continues to struggle with Gumbo but finds a leaflet for a dog show.     Hope that helps|`|vuZWtv24aa	It looks like Jack signed the car lot over to Janine x|`|fZ4IAS7Naa	you can watch it on bbc iplayer

AA11241794	Heath Ledger would have made a better anything than Robert Pattinson.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	No, it would be hard to get a corpse to do all that acting.|`|BJIo6twUaa	i still wouldnt watch the movie if he was in it...the previews would still put me to sleep.|`|URhKqq71aa	Heath was a great actor.    but no, you can't just say he would be great in every role in every movie just because you liked "Dark Knight".    You kids...|`|QQdOpG2xaa	hmmmm  i'd have to see!!  ehhh  idk, i think robert would be better,|`|3ca7663cc9cf92c53a5cde34351097a5aa	I personally think Heath could of done a better job than anybody in any  movie!!  Just me though...|`|4b5IQWcFaa	that role belongs to kinda a dreamy romantic and cute guy.  definitely pattinson.  heath ledger fits best for the kinda scary vampire or villian roles.  definitely not this role.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	No, No, No, HELL NO..|`|rWrizylQaa	I do love Heath Ledger, but Pattinson's face is more carved and stunning. I also can't imagine Heath Ledger looking good pale.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	No, Heath is too old for that role. Maybe 10 years ago and Pattinson or whatever his name is... is gross...|`|tLI94qWNaa	No, I dont agree.  I mean robert pattinson didnt do that great of a job, but heath was way too old and even though he does have that romantic charm, it just wouldnt fit.

FEdixswzaa	It depends on whether you tied the toast butter side up or butter side down. You need to be more specific.|`|4AbXxowTaa	Actually, toast does not always land butter-down.  They tested that theory on mythbusters.  For that matter, cats can fall on their back or side.  Older cats can get vestibular, which throws off their balance.|`|swNHGx1baa	They would float in the air.|`|76cAAPfBaa	That's NOT true that a dropped cat will always land on his feet!      Do it with a cat that doesn't have a TAIL, and I guarantee you he'll land on his back.    They use their tail to flip over.    Oh, but to answer your question, if you did this to a cat WITH a tail, he would hover in the air, and just spin!!|`|akcGfgdcaa	The planet would explode...|`|O2SIJqHXaa	the cat would fly|`|A8NzjbQvaa	the earth would collapse on itself and create a black hole.      http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|2WlNxDwpaa	the floor would bend around the cat|`|0n0zw1Sfaa	a big ******* mess on your floor    thats like throwing the cat in a bath then beating it with a allen wrench|`|plZFYzlZaa	ACTUALLY...      ...mythbusters busted the fact that toast always lands butter side down. Their conclusion stated that it was a 50-50 percent chance on how the toast lands.     If you tie buttered toast to the back of a cat, he'll still land on his feet...and afterwards, try to get the toast of his back.|`|2pOl8PU6aa	Seriously now: the cat would just land on its feet and the toast would just be tied to its back.    -_-|`|zuOqbkdEaa	don't try it let us no|`|D1myoYuGaa	The world would close in on itself.

DvBPLP4saa	I saw Adventureland today and was very pleased.    I live in western PA, near Kennywood, which is where the movie was filmed. I really wanted to see it for the fact that I've been to the park a plethora of times.    Drugs are constantly used throughout the movie. Alcohol and pot is what is mainly used. There is no underage drinking, though, due to the fact that they are suppose to be in their 20s.     There are times when Kristen Stewart's character has sex. She is "seeing" one of the workers at Adventureland, and they have sex a couple of times. BUT, you never see anything at all. At the end though, there is a begining of a sex scene, but once again you don't see anything. There is a lot of kissing, though.    Language? The "F" word is there favorite word is all I can say.     The only warning I can give you is this: don't go into the movie expecting something utterly hilarious. It has more of a serious tone to it than expected. There are funny scenes, but most funny scenes can be viewed through commercials. In my own opinion it has a good solid, serious plot line.     I saw the movie with my mother and young 11 year old sister. Both enjoyed the movie as much as I did.|`|JqhQSjQFaa	most pointless movie ever........not even funny|`|mbtjL7TXaa	HTTP://WWW.STEFSCLOTHES.COM  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

S68v9i4Naa	Harmony has appeared recently in teh Buffy S8 comics but no reference to what's going on in Angel S6 comic series. I'm thinking she escaped L.A. before it became a hell dimension. Also, the Angel Season Six comic takes place 6 months before the Buffy Season Eight comic so it might be hard to do a crossover unless they make the Angel comics catch up cause you never REALLY know how much time has gone by in the TV series as well as the comics. But Angel and Spike (or at least one of them) are supposeably supposed to make an appearance in the new Buffy comics but they technically did in the one of the first 4 issues of Buffy Season 8 but only in a naked dream version. LOL.|`|AA10954273	Now with Angel season 5, but Angel is also a comic book series.  I believe there have been some ties between the two comic series.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	so far there have been no direct links so far as im aware. no characters cross over or anything

1UkTem4Waa	Shoot yourself if you dont like it. All their albums are good. Their albums show diversity, which is better than the same ol boring crap we hear from Panic at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, blablabla all those songs sound the same.

My favs are Morning View and Make Yourself.|`|lRI0c6uSaa	umm whichever one has "dig" in it  i love that song |`|ebxwADDcaa	i dont know about their best, but my favorite by them is Make Yourself.     mostly because of the songs Stellar and Drive, but the rest are also very good.|`|cGcoJ0dNaa	The one with megalomaniac... sorry i forgot the name|`|UNFxjNHkaa	make yourself|`|VeYbalAjaa	Make yourself|`|X4UAMHhRaa	make yourself. before and after that was good, but as of recently, they started sucking. or maybe i just grew out of the phase.

Htoc2AISaa	marilyn manson, no doubt.|`|yS61H04haa	Musically, because of their legacy I would have to say Metallica . Even though I am not a fan.

aSoCKVJ3aa	I think the mentally ill have more challenges than the physically ill. I say this because physical illness is more acceptable on the most part.<br>  <br>  Since I'm bi-polar2, I have first hand knowledge of the stigma that is attached to being mentally ill.  (Mine is under control with the aid of meds.) <br>  <br>  Stereotypes are probably the most widespread among the uninformed and I disregard those people most of the time, but it still makes me uncomfortable when someone looks at me as though I'm loopy.  I still hestiate to tell people for the fear of their reaction.  Even doctors can sometime change their opinion of you once they know. They are much more accepting of the fact that I'm diabetic.<br>  <br>  Even my own parents made fun and spread the word about me in the community just to let people know it wasn't their fault and bemoaned their so-called fact that they didn't know where my condition came from. So you see discrimination came come from those closest to you.<br>   <br>  My brother is schizophrenic (he's homeless and I don't know where he is).  The genes had to come from somewhere don't ya think?  It was harder on my brother because he was sicker.  I remember my mother shouting wildly one day - "Butch is CRAZYas a loon" and laughing wildly. <br>  <br>  I could go on, but it doesn't change a thing especially the opinions of those who choose to judge and criticize blindly.|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	The mentally ill should not be shunned nor condemned. <br>  Some are helped by medication and therapy, while there are others who have no hope of living a normal life, and in fact are a threat to themselves and others.<br>  The ones who cannot be helped have to be taken care of, in a hospital for the mentally ill.|`|Mu3UvybKaa	I think they are often treated like 2nd class citizens, which is very sad. They cannot help the fact they are mentally ill. They need to be helped, not punished. I also think it's a disgrace that we live in a country that actually uses the death penalty on mentally retarded individuals.<br>  <br>  My views? I have known some mentally ill people in my life, but mainly that is just my reaction to what I observe in our country as a whole.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Their perceptions tend to differ from those who are not mentally ill.  They are not worse nor better than anyone else.  They just have different perceptions.  Some can be rude and insensitive but on any given day, so can I.|`|2WiKH3Hkaa	We make life interesting for others.|`|RqevddVvaa	we're people too, just more fun|`|I7Cs8hu1aa	I feel that:<br>  <br>  1) a large percentage of the mentally ill brought it on themselves via substance abuse, so I have little sympathy for them.<br>  <br>  2) I feel the mentally ill are often dangerous and scary.<br>  <br>  I know that this is not true for all mentally ill, but it just seems to be my impression.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	they are usually very intelligent, insightful and tough as sh*t but should never be labeled MENTALLY ILL or INSANE|`|t9htoO50aa	I have done a lot of volunteer work with the mentally challenged. Some of them can be very warm loving people. I have done equine therapy  with them. My wife worked as a councillor with them.

l5mVSsJkaa	Unlikely...The fact is there will always be a ex-Chris Brown fan who will never go back to him cos of what he did. That's what happens with celebrities. One incident can ruin their whole career. Look at britney spears, she went loco and crazy (still is) and now she is doing quite well (still sucks though) He won't be as popular as before though that's for sure.|`|3m1bt4iNaa	No, because domestic violence is not one of those crimes that are considered "cool". let's say TI went to jail because he had a gun, some other rapper had cocaine and that's ok with fans. What he did was just wrong in every possible way, I mean we all have a mother, sister or female friend and to think that this dude who is obviously stronger came and beat the crap out of her is completely wrong. SOMETHING TO PROVE IT WAS THAT I WAS IN A CLUB AND WHEN THEY PLAYED A CHRIS BROWN SONG A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED BOOing N THE DJ HAD TO CHANG THE SONG and later played a Rhianna song ;). Used to like both but now  I can't say the same there is absolutely no reason to beat a woman up like that.|`|FClC80XPaa	After seeing that photo, anyone who has any morals should not want to have anything to do with him. I dont care who you are, how talented you are, or how much money you have there is no excuse for domestic violence. I find it shallow that there are still people out there talking about how sexy he is! How can you possibly find someone like that sexy?|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I think, if he is truly remorseful for what he did, gets help, and never does anything like that again, that he will be back.

OzfrMg9qaa	leo people tend to have pretty good personalities. they are fiery , fun and caring. aquarius men are like that but not very fiery so maybe you balance each other out. i THINK the combination of both signs is a good match and you should go for it.

UGH! =/|`|1vfockYEaa	Yes, all kinds of idiot!|`|nfdlPfdQaa	No, I don' feel like an idiot. As some on here have answered, I laugh about it because I know the person I was waving at usually has went through the same embarrassing moment.

Sometimes it doesn't. lol.|`|WX4zcgRXaa	Oh yea.  feels like you want to just run and hide. lol.|`|3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	Heck no. This only happens to girls.

YIcBd569aa	hi lisa michelle .xxx's to you too.    !. plot?, what plot? they have a plot??? huh?    2. sawyer and sayid....what can I say, I love beefcake sandwiches!! ..don't you??    3. wonderful, lost is a thinking persons show, you have to analyze, decipher, think out of the box so hard you'll have to forcefully put your brains back in the box again. it forces you to think, to remember, to travel through time and to take a lot of aspirin. and then just when you have it all figured out ..there's a twist,there's a turn, there's ben moving the island and so you have to start all over again. rewind the video tape, dust off the season one dvd, find that episode online and phone a Lost friend. then come up with a new theory all over again.    4. the long wait through the summer months to get to the next season.    If only we could time travel we'd be there by now...oh wait, we're here!! see what I mean..time travel,that's the way to go!!!    5. No disappointments, just a very sad day for lost fans. the end.    Feel free to add any comments after answering?:  will you be my constant?|`|AA10998789	No  Sawyer he is so yummy  just started but it has my attention  I like that it keeps me on my toes, no complaints  They better end with all questions answered or I'll be furious.|`|gQEtEtLQaa	1. I forget some of the stuff that happened, that I probably need to remember in order to make sense of the plot, so I should really watch some re-runs and take notes or something.  But I think I have an idea of what's going on.    2. Jack.  He can be a bit patronising sometimes and always thinks he's right but he's lovely really and a nice guy.  Sawyer is hot but he's the kind of guy that you'd have some fun with and then realise that Jack's the guy you really want (or in my case - Desmond!!!)    3. I wish I could answer that one but I haven't seen any of season 5 yet :(  I've been too busy catching up with the new series of Supernatural!! ; )    4.  Locke annoys me most about the show.  I can't stand him, he's just such a patronising git!! The episodes which focus on his character are pretty dull and I wish he would just get off the island and stay off it.    5.  I think when Lost finishes it will probably answer most of our questions but I think it will be the kind of ending that leaves a lot of things open for us to think about.  I don't think we'll get a nice, neat ending with all the loose ends tied up.  It'll probably be like the end of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' when you think it's all finished and then there's one last shot that starts up a whole new storyline.    I can't wait to see all of season 5 - the time travel thing is great, it'll be interesting to see where they go with that : )|`|UY3zl9dFaa	1) I've been somewhat lost since the beginning  2) Sawyer! Jack used to seem so solid and stable, but he's not. Sawyer's such a hottie (those dimples!) and although he tries to act so cool and uncaring he really has a great heart underneath it all (even jumped out of the helicopter to save them!)  3) Loving it! So happy it's finally back.  4) I think they pile on too many mysteries and confusing elements at once.  5) No, I don't think that they'll answer all of the Qs but I don't think we'll be left disappointed so much as wanting MORE!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	1. I think no one really knows the plot yet, except that they are on an island.  2.Sawyer  3.Love it  4.It is all confusing but it keeps me guessing  5.I think it will leave us wanting more, maybe a movie, they better answer all the questions or they are going ot have a bunch of upset people on their hands!|`|RtJ11zUZaa	-No, they just explained alot of the plot  -Jack  -Awesome!  -Nothing bothers me or confuses me  -I think we'll be satisfied.  Not amazed or disappointed, just satisfied.|`|klhFMdCgaa	Sawyer!  Very eenteresting....  The way they don't explain stuff right away.  Questions will be answered...and new ones will be brought up.   That is the way of LOST.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	That show has turned out to be exactly what I told everyone it would be. Them running around in circles on the island, and never getting off. If they get off the island then the show is over, so they will just stretch it out until they leave the island. I didn't know it ever had a plot. It's like Gilligan's Island, but not funny.

VLsSuWD4aa	Cancer...the best moon placement.|`|qLa4tcFraa	CANCER|`|Nx0kNuO4aa	Sun is in 22 Degrees Gemini.   You have a quick, bright and agile mind, but an extremely short attention span. You love the external, kaleidoscopic aspects of life, but you tend to avoid (and even fear) deep, close emotional involvements. As such, you seem to enjoy travel and sightseeing and generally being "on-the-go." You get quite listless when things around you become static and dull, but your excitement returns whenever you are stimulated by a new idea. Chatty, inquisitive and quite playful, you enjoy practical jokes and games in general. Your moods change quickly and often -- you are very restless and constantly in motion. You are known for your versatility and adaptability. Your vivaciousness enlivens any social gathering.     Moon is in 08 Degrees Cancer.   For the most part, you are very strong and secure emotionally. You intuitively know what to do to make others feel comfortable, loved, accepted and needed. You naturally enjoy feeding and taking care of others. Be careful that your mothering does not turn into smothering. At times, you tend to feel that those to whom you are attached can never do anything without your assistance and support. Extremely sensitive by nature, it hurts you deeply whenever anyone criticizes you. You have an almost desperate need to be loved and wanted and needed by everyone with whom you come into contact, and you go out of your way to be accommodating to them.     Mercury is in 17 Degrees Gemini.   Your mind is active, quick and agile. You are very restless and you get bored easily. Unless you receive constant mental stimulation, you become extremely nervous and begin to act in an unstable manner. You are probably a good student because of your natural inquisitiveness. You also love to travel. Your learning tends to be superficial, though, because you have a relatively short attention span. Try to develop the mental discipline to finish what you start. Also, you tend to talk on at times seemingly just to fill space -- make sure that your conversation has some substance to it or others will start avoiding you.     Venus is in 07 Degrees Leo.   You have a striking, regal appearance and demeanor that attracts others to you. Your friendship is highly sought and you tend to take friendships quite seriously -- you remain loyal and true to those to whom you are attached. For you, love is mixed with pride and respect. Relationships are over when you lose respect for your partner. Be careful of a tendency to relate only to those who make you look good -- the powerful, important and influential. This can lead to arrogance and selfishness, and neither of these qualities becomes you.     Mars is in 10 Degrees Leo.   You are a very proud person. Strong, bold, courageous and self-possessed, you love to be the one to initiate significant actions. When people expect a lot of you, you respond positively and will work hard in order to maintain their respect. But when your dignity or pride is threatened, you tend to become sarcastic, arrogant and domineering. Try not to take any challenge or resistance that you meet as a personal affront. You are very stubborn about your right to live your life according to your own principles.     Jupiter is in 11 Degrees Leo.   You must be proud of all that you do in order to grow and develop. You enjoy being totally honest and aboveboard and you revel in the admiration and respect you receive from others due to your high- minded, upright way of life. Make sure, though, that your natural tendency to boast and show off is based on your actual accomplishments. Don't fall prey to self-exaggeration or arrogance. You truly do like outrageous spectacles and grand jolly times and will go out of your way to make them a reality.     Saturn is in 06 Degrees Aquarius.   Your personal sense of values is a reflection of the value structures of your peer group and of those you respect and admire. Try to be more critical in your acceptance of these values -- you tend to prejudge the abilities of those you trust and then follow what they say blindly. Basically very conservative, you prefer orderly, systematic changes and fear doing things rashly or impulsively. Ideas and philosophies must have some sort of immediately realizable, utilitarian function in order for you to pay any attention to them.     N. Node is in 19 Degrees Capricorn.   You rarely get involved closely with anyone unless he or she has something specific and practical to offer you. You tend to be "all business" when it comes to dealing with others. You're usually so intently focused on a particular goal that you rarely have time for social niceties or casual fellowship. But you can definitely be counted on by others to get things done. When you say that you'll do something, you do it. As such, you're a valuable member of any team situation and will probably rise to a position of leadership within the group. Your trustworthiness and sense of responsibility are unquestioned. But do try to avoid the temp

N4ZAzxdMaa	We all know a few facts about rainforests from Tarzan movies; for instance, in the rainforest you will find lush green vegetation, exotic animals, restless natives, and usually a few white men up to no good. But beyond those stereotypes, what are the real rainforest facts? What is the status of the world's rainforests, and why is it important to preserve them?     Here's the first rainforest fact: Rainforests are the oldest ecosystems on earth - they have been evolving for 70-100 million years.    The largest rainforest in the world is the Amazonrainforest in South America, which covers an area about two-thirds the size of the continental United States. To date, more than a quarter of a million square miles of Amazon rainforest have been cleared - about 17.5 percent of it.    Average temperatures in rainforests stay relatively constant year-round, usually in the 75-80F range.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Rain forests: Rain regularly occurring in a generous amount.  Large growth of trees and brush.  Host to many unique animals, plants and insects.  Is shrinking due to deforestation as land is cleared for farming.  We are losing potential of discovering cures to diseases and illnesses by having varieties of plants going extinct before we discover them or their properties.  It is not fully explored and there are plants and animals that are as of yet unknown.|`|PEz2YMeXaa	They have trees|`|0sw3ukClaa	May be you can search in www.rainforest-alliance.org  Or maybe you can also visit www.indonesiarainforest.org , this is about rainforest in my country (Indonesia).    In my country there are large area of rainforest. But unfortunately some greed people deforest it for their own sake.

She can NOT ACT HER AGE! which is 16, not twenty something!  But she is RICH, and the RICH do whatever they want!  SPOILED RICH BRAT!!!!

If she can,t ACT like a little girl she should NOT be out there being an influence on the rest of the little girls!!|`|rvRimbVYaa	She is made for small children but teens do not like her cause they have more taste in music and she is just too much fake. and us adults do not like her either but we have other things to see more adapted for us. but if you like her you should not stop watching her and like her because of other people.|`|bQh43Gtpaa	I dislike her because she seems so fake.

CrgcaGMKaa	Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who want to pursue a career in the medical field but don't want to go through all the schooling and becoming a RN or such is perfect for that. I'm considering it myself.|`|tcVm5HWgaa	Not at all.    If a person has an ambition they should go for it.    If you are thinking of taking up nursing I wish you all the luck in the world.    (and think of all the other nurses, 99% female!!!!!)    Follow your dream|`|D1myoYuGaa	no i think that its fine im a girl and there is no way i would go for a nursing or even hospital job.|`|pIiqXbFBaa	No.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	There is a certain stigma about it, Im old what do I know|`|zyTrMeovaa	No I think it is fine.|`|zEp6xHacaa	no, it's a job like any other|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Yeah probably.

He's cool!!|`|3YJbVYaHaa	Ya Man!!!!, I do because I guess its a double standard because you hear the word nurse and you associate that with a female, people always justify this with the "Life is not fair", proverb. But do what you want because people will always judge you no matter what!!|`|aOcPLOOSaa	yes|`|NUW5KONtaa	No, there are alot of guys who do that..    It shouldn't matter what other people think, if you like what you do it shouldn't matter.|`|hIrBZS3oaa	No.  Doctors are hot :-)    It's almost like being a doctor.  Plus I'd rather have a hot guy taking my blood than some old lady any day.  For some reason I don't think it would hurt as much.|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	Not its not gay or fruity.    Many of the people in the medical field are heroes, not matter their preference.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	No.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	no i think it's cool!|`|B5fdh5oIaa	Yes!|`|x1RVcfp7aa	Nope I dont think it is fruity|`|ztb1F35Xaa	no but if im close to the person i make fun of them as a joke|`|13b0ee2df2675456a4d60accfb6c703faa	No it's not fruity to me...|`|HeE9lqi5aa	nurse sounds girly...... how abt "health worker"??? well, that sounds manly....

Dhnn6hBqaa	I think certain artists like to change it up a bit, and won't play certain songs except for random occasions. Then there are those who have that one song that either made them famous of defines them. In any case, the fans shouldn't be denied the "hits".    I wouldn't think the artists get bored with their songs, they are the reason they're performing after all, but a varied set list is definitely a friend to any musician.|`|BLrF5rU6aa	Yes, they do get tired of singing the same songs. But, they do it because they are paid too. The same way you get paid to do things you really don't want to do. It's a job. So, the answer is they do get bored singing the same songs, but it pays the bills.

PaXJcw3paa	The setting of "Naruto" is in a universe that draws its fashion influence from many areas, including Japan. The traditional footwear of their culture just so happens to be sandals.  Their sandals zip up the back.  Also, they are ninjas so they need special footwear.  I'd imagine that the design of their sandals allows for them to concentrate their chakra into their feet so they can run up walls or run on water.  If they had closed shoes, they would have a harder time getting their chakra focused at the bottom of their feet, but with open-toed shoes, the energy flows easier.  And if by weird form you mean their shoes, they are probably designed to be padded.  In the series, ninja run all over the place and jump through trees.  Imagine doing that in flip flops.  Also, their sandals zip up the back and that's probably to secure the sandals to the wearer's ankles.  Also I'd imagine the bottom of the sandals are similar to skater shoes where they have super grips on the bottom.|`|asaeVSehaa	They're sandals or shoes inspired by sandals, for the most part.    For "ninjas", having your toes exposed makes it easier to climb walls and so forth, although Naruto characters pretty quickly learn to chi-cheat on that score.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	There's no tradition to it.    The creator just likes to use sandals as signiture shoes or something.    Its just more easier to fight in and such.|`|FqjgCT1Qaa	Nah, they're just ninja sandals.
6pk6HnuSaa	punk was available in the late 70's ?    it became "fashionable" in the 80's - which actually made it less punk|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	that would be more "new wave" don't you think.....|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yep that would work just fine.|`|tcVm5HWgaa	The punk era was mid-late 70's.    You are miles out in the 80's    The 80's was the 'New Romantic' look    Google the band 'Spandau Ballet' or 'Duran Duran'    This applies to the UK. Things may have been different in other countries    Enjoy the party

Your attitude going into any situation will produce the results, whether you know it or not.  Positively, think positive.  I might inquire of the individual making the comment as to what characteristics he or she admires about your driving.  All in all, good legs.  Take that to the bank as a positive.

Xy4kHpteaa	Okay, it's really hard to explain but basically the kiss was not at all romantic. It was like a huge slap in the face really. Freddie resorted to violence by head budding Cook which is sort of what Cook wanted, in a way. Cook lives for attention and for pissing people off and making them do things they wouldn't normally do so, in the heat of the moment, Cook kissed Freddie response. It was something more powerful,more threatening than a punch. A fight can be shaken off, forgiven and forgotten, what Cook did, was express a love for Freddie that was like saying you can do whatever you want. Betray me, fight me, argue, and abandon me, but you will never get rid of me. And then he goes and ***** Effie, incredible, right?|`|fZqvuKHuaa	Cook just chases his desires, he'll do anything to get some 'action'. He knew a while back that Freddie wanted to be with Effy but he still chased after her then. <br>  <br>  Effy's just mixed up. Hopefully she'll get with Freddie in the end. :)|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Effy is seriously screwed up. She doesn't know what she wants. And Cook...he's a complete prat.
dHcP602caa	The top 36 is going to be split up into three groups of 12. <br>  The first group has already performed, the second one will perform next week, and the third one will perform the week after that. <br>  America votes after the performances and the top 3 vote getters will be in the top 12. <br>  After all three groups perform, there's going to be a Wild Card episode where the judges pick one person from each group that didn't make it through with our votes and put them through as well.|`|KvBCYpnOaa	There are 36 people now, 3 groups of 12 preform and the top 3 from each group we voted get to stay, so that makes 9 people. then the judges get to pick one "wildcard" from each group, that wasn't voted by us, but who have potential. and that makes 12 ! =)|`|LkTcLWTOaa	first week 12 perform, 9 are eliminated.<br>  same thing happens second and third week.<br>  the judges then pick 3 wild cards from the ones eliminated in the first three weeks.

Don't try to make it to TV or Vegas right away . If you know what I mean. Until people know how you play and how much they like you, it will have to be the bottom for now.

We ended up being something of a house band for the next year and a half.  We played other venues, but mainly just the one small bar.  We had a small fan base, and they knew where to find us.<br>  <br>  The bar where I started public performing is now a fingernail salon.  Sad.|`|yS61H04haa	Are you all legal?

The remains of the Titanic are slowly crumbling into ruin on the bottom of the sea, and in a way, perhaps that is a good thing. Time hasn't stood still, all things pass away. The artifacts and personal items brought up from the wreck serve to remind us that the Titanic's story was a story about people, not just about a ship, and in a way, the fact that they are brought back up into light and air and onto land, in some ways can symbolize their journey's completion.         The wreck site isn't a memorial, or a consecrated gravesite; it's the place the ship's wreckage landed. All who died, did so either in the freezing waters of the North Atlantic, or literally moments after the ship sank beneath the surface and plunged into the darkness. Their bodies are all now long gone, their souls at rest.    I'm glad the Titanic was found, nevertheless. I'm glad to have seen the photos taken of her on the ocean floor, to have seen the exhibit of relics recovered from her and to imagine what it must have been like to sail on her, to discover fragments of a world now 96 years in the past and preserved.  Yes, it would be a good thing to leave the wreck alone, but it's really too late to do anything about it.|`|jQ0KXt6Aaa	Well I mean. Maybe they are trying to find interesting artifacts.    Or maybe not.|`|hVKqKjrjaa	I think the same as I would if they dug up the local graveyard,,,,,horrified.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	I think it should be left alone..I mean it happened along time ago...and all those people died ..I think they all need to RIP even the Ship!!|`|AA12218857	It's just interesting for us, isn't it? It was meant to be unsinkable and it sunk, and I suppose because it's down there, and we know it is, it's hard not to go down there and have a look around. Well. For some sea divers anyway - I couldn't personally care either way :P!|`|69GgJhnWaa	I agree. it should be left alone. I understand the historical value, I understand all of the things that can be learned from items excavated from the site. I really do. However, that is the final resting place of hundreds of people that died in a terrible way. I feel like when they dive and rummage through their things, it's basically the same as decimating their grave sites. It feels intrusive and wrong to me. I feel like people should respect what happened and respect the history involved there, but we've pulled up enough items for whatever reasons. I feel like it's time to let the site be.|`|e41w1Cmuaa	I agree with you. Its a part of history and it should be kept that way. Sure, 40 years ago it was a good idea so archaeologists could get info and stuff, but what else do they expect to find down there?! Cos they'll get nothing. I have been bought up to know and like the Titanic, my dad and my grandparents are, well were, obsessed with it! Figurines, posters and everything. We even have a huge (massive!) kinda montage of the movie signed by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio! Personally, I think the wreckage should be left alone. Other people disagree, but why?! Rawwr! Interesting question though, star for you!    x x x|`|ztzL7ntwaa	Yes I totally agree with you. What do they think they will find by going back to it for the 1,000th time?  Leave the ship and the ghosts alone, people!|`|VXcnq3zGaa	Actually, many other burial sites have been excavated. That seems to be the bulk of an archaeologists work these days.    What do you think about the Mary Rose? Should that ship have been left at the bottom of the sea too? Personally, I think it is important to try and preserve any historical artefacts we can. But there must at all times be respect for the dead, and I don't doubt that the divers do have that.|`|YN0DdLVlaa	It doesn't really bother me either way, There just looking for possessionsand things aren't they?|`|DRSjrp04aa	Yeah I agree, maybe the ship does have feelings, left at the bottom of the sea being eaten away by bacteria, and watched by divers, I'm coming titanic, I care about ur feelings, Ill be your best friend!

a9f222712e5917f601d0e68719ea00d3aa	You may need to put a new reed in. Not one that's been in storage. They dry out. Also, check the connections of the clarinet. Is there a leak or crack? Are the pads dried out?    I suggest you take it to a music shop for a good cleaning and have the pads replaced. It's inexpensive to do this.|`|gM03eKTJaa	Trying a different (fresh) reed could help. Maybe even a weaker reed? Make sure there isn't anything stuck inside the instrument and that the keys are all working. Some keys may need to be adjusted, throat A/G  keys, and that the bridge keys are properly lined up. There might also be something with the pads after long storage so check them too. If you can't find anything, take it to a repair tech to check out.  Good luck!|`|8cDd70dSaa	Make sure the reed is fresh...I certainly hope it's not as old as the clarinet. If it is, make sure it's moist. If it's a wood clarinet, make sure there are no cracks in the wood. Finally, if the mechanism is not an issue, try getting a new mouthpiece. It could work wonders.

You need to tell a sad story (job loss, etc.) to convince them why you maybe forced to cancel service but if they lower it you might like to have it for the sake of your children.  I don't think they will lower it if you simply tell them that they are expensive.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	I have dealt with this more times than I can count and almost 100% of the time they offer you a bunch of free movie channels like HBO, Showtime or cinemax.|`|oUTKodLPaa	one time  i said i was going to go to a different cable provider, and they apologized for everything and gave me like a month free and lowered my monthly rates, but not by that much. they also gave me an extra movie channel for free|`|9zMC6EBtaa	As long as you are persistent, I have know several people who have gotten their bills lowered to their original rate.

nMWtEmEFaa	That's just art in the style of anime.    You can tell what's a real anime, and what is just art done in the anime style. The art tends to be MUCH more detailed, especially in this sort of style.    In a real anime, anyone posting a picture of it, wouldn't title it 'anime couple', they would use the real name of the anime characters. Also anime characters look rather unique, unlike the characters in the pictures that you provided, they look very generic and not recognizable from any show.    Anime also is cell-shaded, in the art pictures, there's some actually detailed shading going on, something that makes it very distinct from an actual anime show. Hope that helped.|`|sj3HJ5jZaa	i dont think thats a anime|`|tVvH28GCaa	It's just anime styled art. It's not from an actual anime. There are plenty of these on the internet, and many people get confused.  I find the easiest way to tell is the lack of black lines, and how it looks more like a painting than a cartoon.|`|qawExNakaa	I'm pretty sure that is just some one drawing anime pics that, through constant re-uploading, lost the name of the artist...however, if you're looking for animes with that style, AIR is a good bet~  Hope that helps
10mOwk0Taa	When does it stop being partly cloudy and start being partly sunny?  When its 49% sun and 51% clouds.  At what point in man's evolution did he start wiping his ***?  Probably pretty early on - banana leaves were used at first.  Why do they call him Donkey Kong if he is not a donkey?  Who knows.  Why do they say a football team is the 'world champion' when they don't play anybody outside the US?  Because they're stupid.  If you really could dig a hole to China, and you did, and you fell in, would you stop in the middle because of gravity?  No, you'd stop in the mantle due to steaming hot lava.  If a bee is allergic to pollen would it get the hives?  It wouldn't make it, and would probably die at birth.  Do all-boys schools have girls bathrooms? Conversely, do all-girls schools have boys bathrooms?  Yes.  There are teachers (and often students) of the opposite sex at all-gender schools.  Why does caregiver and caretaker mean the same thing?  Because you either give care to someone or you take care of someone.  If a guy that was about to die in the electric chair had a heart attack should they save him?  No, they shouldn't.  But a heart attack doesn't mean imminent death, and they'd probably have to try to save him so that his family and prisoner rights groups can't sue for cruel and unusual punishment.  If a nursing mother had her nipples pierced would the milk come out of all three holes?  Nope, the ducts are only hooked up to the one pathway.  Besides its not really one clean hole, it kind sprays out in all directions anyway.  How do you handcuff a one-armed man?  You hook the other cuff to the back belt loop of his pants.  What happens if a queen gives birth to a pair of siamese twins? Who gets to be king?  In the olden days, the children would be considered an atrocity and killed anyway.  Now a days, the same could very well happen. (Not to say that its right.)  Why do people say "heads up" when you should duck?  This goes to animal instinct, like when deer sense trouble the all put their heads up.  Why is it OK for dudes to slap other dudes' asses in football, but not in any other situation?  They do it in baseball too.  When sign makers go on strike, is anything written on their signs?  They don't have a union, so they most likely wouldn't strike.  Why do we press the start button to turn off the computer?  "Start" on the screen (like in Windows) refers to where to start to choose commands...the button on the actual tower is called the power button.  How important does a person have to be before they are considered assassinated instead of just murdered?  Good question.  According the dictionary, assassination, "is the intentional killing of a specified victim or group of victims, perpetrated for a reason related to his (her, their) public prominence and usually undertaken with a political purpose in view."  Whereas murder is the unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice.  So all assassinations are murders but not the other way around.|`|2OHjXfBKaa	lmao! those are some very good questions|`|NpGSXNqmaa	lol nice|`|0roil3Udaa	briiliant..well if u find an answer, do post them in here...lolz|`|WzJLmXTiaa	nice star 4 u best answer please|`|8EW3JDmbaa	Excellent point!

Acting is natural - perhaps even using non-actors - look it up.    Mise en scene in real locations rather than studio sets.    Regular conversations favored over "literary dialogue".    You need to study if you don't know that!|`|tLI94qWNaa	Well this is what the summary of the movie is     "Francois Truffaut's first feature was this 1959 portrait of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Laud), a boy who turns to petty crime in the face of neglect at home and hard times at a reform school. Somewhat autobiographical for its director, the film helped usher in the heady spirit of the French New Wave, and introduced the Doinel character, who became a fixture in Truffaut's movies over the years. Poignant, exhilarating, and fun (there's a parade of cameo appearances from some of the essential icons and directors from the movement), this film is an important classic."

RzbRRUOdaa	I think you are looking for a traditional publisher.  The one that reviews and evaluates your story before they consider it for publishing.  There are several companies that you can find online.    But an alternative that you may consider is self-publishing.  Most of the writers in the 21st century do this as a strategy to get their books published immediately and according to their preference.    Check this blog site that features the benefits of self-publishing and what you need to do to get your book published:  http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...

n8FBMerKaa	I think you are a Gemini sun, with a Pisces rising, and a Cap moon.    As far as your best match, for a woman, the Moon and Mars are very strong indicators of what types of men you will be attracted to.  So if your Moon and Mars are in earth/water, men with earth/water will be very attractive to you.  If your Moon and Mars are split between earth/water and air/fire, you will have a broader interest in mates.  Also your Venus to mates Mars is a strong connecting point. - using the same idea.  Your Venus sign indicates what types of men will be attracted to you.    My Moon and Mars are Gemini/Leo.  I have always been much more attracted to fire/air signs, and my husband is an Aries - and this is despite my Scorpio sun (and Scorpio dominant).    If you would like to find out your full birthchart; i.e., Sun, Moon, Rising, etc. and the houses, chaoastrology has a neat chart.  Alabe also has a good chart, but does not include the houses.

I didn't regret it then, but I do now. (I'm 22 now, by the way).<br>  <br>  I wish I could tell young teen girls to just wait. Because we always end up thinking that "if I have sex with him, he'll love me more, want me more, or never leave me"<br>  <br>  This is NOT the case. I was lucky because the guy I lost my virginity to really did love me. He wanted to be with me, but I later realized that I didn't love him like I thought that I did.<br>  <br>  The cold truth, though, is that a lot of guys like to "hit it and quit it" meaning once they get the booty, they start looking for someone else that they havent gotten to sleep with them yet." <br>  <br>  I will never fully understand the male psyche. But I do know that waiting is the best choice, because you don't want to lose it to someone who doesn't love you, and you don't want to lose it to someone who you really don't love. Even more importantly, you don't want to get pregnant by a guy who doesn't love you, or a guy you don't love enough to stay with. Pregnancy happens and young girls would do well to remember it.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	not really|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Absolutely not. I was 16 and didn't think it was ever going to happen.

wQoDOPbeaa	It's all a scam, you buy the car, pay the taxes-wheel,county,state and road. Then you have to buy insurance. And the insurance company's rape you with no kiss! What gives? There should be a cap on how much you pay for your auto insurance.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I have had similar experience - I phoned and they wanted to charge a whopping 20% extra for paying by direct debit! I said not on your nelly too. <br>  <br>  What is it these days, companies charge you to pay, charge you if it's by direct debit, and if it's not. I mean payment charges to process your payment!  What is the world coming to.|`|MTV2nL33aa	nope, it's not usual... from my experience I've used that site a few times.. although if the insurer is changing the goal posts, go elsewhere.<br>  <br>  some companies don't like being listed there and when you ring em up direct you find out why.. because they are too expensive|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	I believe it is because the web sites have not covered the whole issue regarding you and your insurability.|`|f1zTpzjKaa	Hmmm sadly it does happen.<br>  <br>  First of all Confused have contracts with all of their providers which place the onus on the provider to only supply correct pricing and not charge more than they would on their own site.<br>  <br>  However errors can occur in the technology and sometimes it does happen.<br>  <br>  From an insurance companies point of view, the pressure is to come top as often as possible so that people at least call them and they get a chance to sell a policy.  From time to time it is not unknown for less scrupulous providers to show better prices or products than are available.  The most often occurence I have seen is claiming that the legal cover is included then when you visit the providers site, they charge extra for it.<br>  <br>  Confused, like all aggregators keep a close check on it and it is not rife but it can happen.

DfBH8Dr9aa	Different negatives have to be replaced with positive. Words,habits, thoughts. Our own limited thinking hinders faith. God can do anything but we limit him with our faith in the negative.

Since it is only one drink, it's not likely to impair your vision, judgment or motor control and is not a "recipe for disaster."<br>  <br>  What would be, however, is if an alcoholic decided they should soothe their nerves with some liquid courage, ended up drinking too much because they are an alcoholic, and decided to try to take the test anyway.|`|13fDE4nGaa	I just turn on the auto drive<br>  and hold on & hope 4 the best|`|qWqg7vFJaa	If that fella had any sense he would have thrown them out of the car straight away..Its lethal|`|IizPFrELaa	That's just nutz, and agree that it's an accident just waiting to happen!|`|DDjFmoMqaa	Drink-driving KILLS!!!|`|HELfs3uhaa	Yes it is....one day the drunks will rule the roads.

And I read an article that stated that most of the items included in the stimulus will be uncheckable-like we won't be able to tell if it's working or not. This is just more of the same BS I have seen NO change thus far-just as I suspected. And I'm tired of hearing it is early on-he promised us immediate change and all we're seeing is more of the same crap-immediately. I'm not saying he can fix the economy overnight-but some sign of governmental change would have been nice-no we spend a ton on his inauguration-in this economy it would have been a Change had he said-screw this-we can't spend this much money on this nonsense but no. He keeps nominating more crooked politicians to serve on his administration-why did we not have enough as is. I give up-this seems hopeless.......|`|lpznO5Inaa	It seems strange that the most expensive project ($17.5 billion) isn't even in the continental U.S. It's in effing Puerto Rico.

It IS important that the dog has somewhere to play, no matter where they are. *Rolls eyes*. <br>  <br>  As a dog owner....I can speak with certainty that they could spend $1000 grading the land...not sodding it...and the dogs won't care.

Og3vKQeWaa	castleford, west York's, nothing happens to them, because the waste of space police, aren`t bothered with them(too much paperwork) so they carry on anoying people, till they get an ASBO!|`|dkEUJPhnaa	A lot of neighbors in my area are VERY nosy and they would be the one to call the police if they heard so much as a raised sound from anyone. If a police car turned up they'd all be nosing out of their windows! Not many parents call the police on their children these days in my area but it's a small place.|`|NbjU4lxsaa	My mom has called the police on me for the EXACT reasons you listed.<br>  <br>  I live in America though. <br>  <br>  All you have to do is act civil and calm when the cops come. If you act pissed off and have a major attitude (Like I did) then things will not work out so well for you. The cops won't be able to do anything to you unless you lay a hand on your parents. They might try to say you were 'Disturbing the peace' so you shouldn't be screaming at the top of your lungs.<br>  <br>  I think it's complete bullshit. If a parent calls the police on their teen child for just arguing it proves that they can't handle it and they probably never should have had kids in the first place.<br>  <br>  Remember, don't get to out of control on your parents or they might have something on you. Good luck!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	It's usually the neighbours.. because the kids are out by the corner shops. SOUTH LONDON lol.. can't get more dangerous than the south baby!|`|BEqAhXBlaa	"because their son or daughter is arguing back in a loud tone of voice or wont go to their room, etc" <br>  <br>  I would hope the outcome is the parents get arrested for wasting police time|`|cYsPx9sSaa	never happened to me, live in east london, although if my parents dont watch their backs im going to call the old bill on THEM|`|FsXTyGH9aa	probably quite common as the parent thinks they can scare the child but to be honest the police dont take it too seriously.

nDSLNnguaa	racism: a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race <br>  <br>  It won't ever end because there will always be ignorant, uneducated people who believe that their race is superior. Fear is a breeder of racism.  People fear what they don't understand or know.  Sterotypes also contribute to the fear and ignorance.<br>  <br>  This is sounding like a ramble but having grown up in all different places I have developed an appreciation for racial and cultural differences.

bBs9JTdUaa	I thought Dean and Sam Winchester killed it!|`|4IVWMgp7aa	There was a woman from Texas who found a dead creature, after sighting unusual animals on her farm, that she thought was a chupacabra, or a close relative to it.  It was hairless, had an overly obvious spine, large fangs, and was nocturnal.  There was evidence that it was killing farm animals and drinking the blood.<br>  <br>  Veterinary "experts" determined that it was "just a mutation of a dog" and the fact that it was hairless, nocturnal, and drank blood was totally unremarkable.   It seems pretty obvious to me that sightings of this ugly "dog" could easily have been the start of the chupacabre legend.|`|H10X8Sylaa	No... its folklore.<br>  <br>  its entertainment... something to tell the locals round a campfire.<br>  <br>  or to explain why cattle dies.|`|g5g1yD1daa	idk i seen lots of pix and lots of ppl say that it is but i dont think so|`|64oOqELCaa	yes|`|Amkmles0aa	yes|`|86acf988bd253bcd1586d895b2e5a43aaa	We named our cat Chupa because as a kitten, he sort of looked like one =)

tmVoiH6iaa	nope...definitely not!! dats a very odd way 2 compare b/w da 2.. but still life is a exam where at times u may fail & at times u score well but getting best answers depends on da answerer's viewpoint & also if da questioner's q? has been solved or not.. but regarding myself.. until now i've been scoring well in my life test it may not b da same as da % of best answers i've received so far!! <br>  & its gud 2 hav u back.. i surely missed ur questions!!<br>  Tc.. ^^|`|2SEVDjpnaa	How do you quantify 'success percentage in life'?|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	no, my success is about the same as my best answer's percentage! check my profile and u will know how much i had achieved!|`|PnIO5uo9aa	no|`|rs4b84cRaa	not exactly,the success never depends on a single thing.<br>  <br>  but yeah it shows the person ability to understand other point of view,and it shows a social skill.<br>  <br>  but it doesn't ensures a person's success or failure.|`|0ixo6bkdaa	Nope|`|4D6xfsnlaa	the hell man!

He told his friends that he felt very tired.

SL98InTfaa	My dad and step mom decided because they had a small wedding, that they (2 years later) were going to redo their vows in front of the entire city. I don't remember what I was doing before, but I was the maid of honour and was going to be late. This was all taking place in my school gym. I ran through the doors and ran up onto the stage before I realized I was wearing sweat pants for this fancy wedding. So I still got up on stage, then my mom interrupted the entire thing to tell me my hamster had died. So, when they were about to kiss I started bawling. I sprinted home which is like 20 miles from my school and ran to my room and Macaroni (my hamster) was just running on his wheel, like he always does.<br>  <br>  It was a bizarre dream. <br>  <br>  Want some spaghetti and syrup? I can grab us some paper towel!|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	i had a dream that there were these litle indian people who carried sheets of paper covered in a particular color of ink, according to their tribe. once a year, they would throw the paper off a cliff to dye the ground their color. but the red tribe was mean and dyed everybody else's ink red. then there was like a train of computers or something...<br>  <br>  then i woke up in the bathroom. haha, i didn'e even know i sleepwalked!!|`|JV0i77uiaa	My weird dream was that there was a men in my room pulling the blanket and he wants to take me away.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Wolverine would win.<br>  <br>  Since Wolvie's adamantium has been removed by Magneto, Wolverine heals at an even faster rate than before.  He heals almost instantly now.  He also his claws.  All Spidey has is his web, and that's limited.  It also melts after 1 hour.  <br>  <br>  You also have to look at their philosophy.  Spidey doesn't kill.  Wolverine will kill.  Remember how he popped his claws into sabretooth and pretty much turned Sabretooth into a moving vegetable?|`|KXispLytaa	Spiderman|`|aAj4dSyuaa	Hmm, I guess Spider-Man.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	spidey.|`|59Rd381caa	Well... I saw your question yesterday and came up with a theory. I just want to tell you right now that I worked really hard on this theory. Anyways....<br>  <br>  Peter Parker was on his way to pizza hut one day when Jack Black said "You wanna go!? You wanna GO!!??" So Tobey, I mean Parker Pete- I mean Pedro- I mean Peter Parkburn- I mean PARKER... transformed into Spider-Man and dueled it out with Black. Jack Black was losing the battle because Spider-Man was killing Jack Black so Jack Black told Kyle Glass to come where the battle was and turn him into Wolverine. That's exactly what he did. Now Jack Black was wolverine and he could beat up Spider-Man.<br>  <br>  The battle raged on. Spider-Man's health bar was getting low so he grabbed a health pack and restored his life to fullness. Just then Wolverine brought out his secret weapon. And I know what you're thinking. Claws. The very same claws that he's murdered- I mean defended millions of people with. Also the same claws that he uses in the X Men. <br>  <br>  But no. The secret weapon was not his claws. (No matter how much you wanted them to be) The secret weapon was William Shakespeare's poetry!!! Wolverine knew how very much Spider-Man hated poetry ever since he heard "The Itsy bitsy spider" and now wolfy was going to bring it! <br>  <br>  "The Itsy bitsy Spider went up the water spout! Down came the rain and WASHED the spider out!" "NNNNOOOO!!!!" Said spider-man. He immediately stoped punching Wolverine and said "You win... take this pic of my awesome gf... WATSON!!! MARY JANE WATSON! THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!" So Wolverine wins for no reason what ever so ever. THE END|`|VwUbvo4Paa	Tough, but since Wolverine could regenerate. If they were to fight with K.O then maybe Spiderman has the uperhand since he could climb, but if Wolverine were to dig his claws into Spiderman then Wolverine would win.|`|JY5MW1Qgaa	Wolverine.

oo3pax9Eaa	Kahler tremolos were big in the 80's and early 90's.  They went out of production and Gary Kahler started making gold clubs, believe it or not.  I think they wipe the pavement with Floyd Rose tremolos!  They're smooth, easy to re-string, repair, and set up where as Floyds go right through the body, and are difficult to set up.  Kahlers always stay in tune.  In my experience, Floyds don't.  (You can find a video on Youtube of a guy comparing the two).<br>  I know there was a lawsuit against Kahler filed by Floyd Rose, because I think Kahler made floyd style trems without getting permission.  Don't quote me on that, I could be wrong.  I also believe it was part of the reason he went out of business.<br>  Kahler is back up and running now.  Glen Drover (Megadeth), Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman (Slayer) are among the many artists who use Kahlers, among many others including myself!  I have always used Kahlers, as I believe they are far superior to a Floyd Rose.  You can check them out at Kahlerusa.com.  They make all kinds of trems and bridges, including bass trems for 4 5 and 6 string basses, and 6 7 and ever 8 string guitar tremolos. You can also do a search for Kahler on Ebay.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|zUi3nIPRaa	they are similar to floyd rose trem systems only better

P5TktEPyaa	According to wikipedia:<br>  John Locke (pronounced /l?k/; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher. Locke is considered the first of the British empiricists, but is equally important to social contract theory. His ideas had enormous influence on the development of epistemology and political philosophy, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, classical republicans, and contributors to liberal theory. His writings influenced Voltaire and Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. This influence is reflected in the American Declaration of Independence.[1]<br>  <br>  Locke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin for modern conceptions of identity and "the self", figuring prominently in the later works of philosophers such as David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first philosopher to define the self through a continuity of "consciousness". He also postulated that the mind was a "blank slate" or "tabula rasa"; that is, contrary to Cartesian or Christian philosophy, Locke maintained that people are born without innate ideas.[2]

I don't know The Lighthouse Family's "High" at all.  Now I see that Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" and Jimmy Cliff's "I Can See Clearly Now" are very good songs but I don't know if they would be appropriate for a funeral unless ther were his favorite songs.|`|6rvzeOsqaa	the songs played at a funeral should be songs that the deceased person liked.  within reason, of course - they should be tasteful.|`|irxnnhnEaa	Enter Sandman - Metallica|`|gvQaF0aFaa	idk but im sorry for your loss|`|pyjD9tKmaa	I don't think they're good choices.

Not only does it sound beautiful, but it has some relevance as a funeral song, look it up on wikipedia and then listen to it.<br>  <br>  Or you could try the beautiful "Music For The Funeral Of Queen Mary", by Henry Purcell.|`|VJ2aG6znaa	Meh.  <br>  Try <br>  Stairway to heaven<br>  Always look on the bright side of life - life of brian<br>  I will think up a few more brb
