20090219224847AA8J1iD	Travel;United States;New York City	Better hotel: the Doubletree Metropolitan or the Radisson Lexington?	I am trying to decide which hotel to book a room with for a week or so. The Doubletree seems to have better reviews, and both are on Lexington which is a perfect location for my trip. Anybody know anything I don't know? Anyone stay in either, or both, and have a preference? They are both very reasonably priced right now, though the Radisson is a bit cheaper. My fate could be in your hands! :)      Also, please, if you're going to comment and say that the hotel staff is rude... explain or give an example. I know that some people simply like to get their feet kissed and are never satisfied by any amount of customer service - I'm pretty easy to deal with and to please. Thanks!

20090219231352AAkvLYh	Travel;Asia Pacific;China	How much, on average, does a single person need to earn to live comfortably in Hong Kong?	I've been doing some research on the internet about the cost of living in hong kong. I was born in Hong Kong but I grew up in Canada (I'm tilingual, fluent in English, Cantonese and Mandarin).       First, Housing. I've seen cheap listings for living in the Hong Kong Island area (Wan Chai) between 6000-8000 HKD a month, inclusive.      Second, Jobs. I saw job postings for an ordinary secretary or personal assistant for 17k-20k HKD a month. That's what I'm aiming to get into. Or maybe office jobs in banks (I have banking experience in Canada) that pay somewhere near that amount.      I've traveled to Hong Kong and am somewhat familiar with how much the food and entertainment would cost. But from the job listings and the rental listings, it sounds kind of... easy? I'm not married, am not a big spender, but would like to save a bit of money.      My questions, is the above information true? How much does an average person make in Hong Kong? Is 20k considered to be a well paid job? How much, on average, does a single person need to earn to live comfortably in Hong Kong? (comfortably as in living average, eating average). And finally, would you say it is very difficult for a tilingual Chinese-Canadian university graduate to find a job that supports an average life in Hong Kong?

20090219234255AAnEzg6	Travel;New Zealand;Auckland	If you live on the North Shore, Auckland & have had the water meters upgraded in your street, has your bill?	drastically increased since then?      A few months ago we had our water meters & water system upgraded in our area. This means we got a whole new water meter. I just got my annual water bill & it's tripled! It says I'm using a large amount of water for a 3 person household. But I am only a one person household & the past bills said I was using a normal amount of water for a one person household. Not only that, but I've just been overseas for 3 months & for the last year I've mostly had showers at the gym, whereas prior to that I didn't belong to a gym so had them at home. I can't have a leak as I just checked the meter (& the meter no. - yes they have read the correct one) & it's not ticking over as it would be if there was a leak. My hot water cyclinder is fine as I checked the overflow pipe & there's nothing leaking out of it. Sounds to me like something went wrong when they installed the meter & maybe they put the meter reading device forward or something or maybe they ran alot of water from my property at the time of installation or something? No doubt the Water company will not take responsibility. If you are a water expert or work in that industry, what do you think?

20081005112219AAkerEh	Travel;Asia Pacific;Singapore	Have you ever met a good taxi driver, a passenger and a phone operator in assisting a lost phone person?	A personal real incident tonight at 2415 (Sintime) 6/9/08.  I dropped  the hand phone in the back seat of the taxi, NTUC -SHB3468J  (drop out from pocket) knowing after alighting and was too late to stop the taxi.  Called telecom to disconnect the phone but later realised that need to call my phone to alert the driver of a phone in the back seat and to get the operator to help to reconnect the numbers and was done at great speed because of the urgency.  Bad luck, the phone was on vibration mood, no sound and so it took about 30mins before a passenger pick up and answered.  After telling him the details, he passed the phone to the driver and arranged to return the phone at the previous stop point all the way from Bishan to Bt Panjang (quite a long distance about 12km). Offer to report to Company,NTUC for good service & conduct but he didn't accept it and only took my payment of the return trip of my phone.      Need to show my appreciation for the good hearted & kind good service of the driver, the willing & helpful passenger of Bishan and the tele-operator in this incidence in S'pore.  What a change to KL Taxi drivers in the news.        There is always a good side of a picture in the good area of living.

20080315130320AAY4ksj	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Advice on finding off-campus housing in Pittsburgh?	This fall I'm hoping to attend the Pennsylvania Culinary Institute in Pittsburgh (on Liberty Ave.) If all goes well and I'm accepted, I'm hoping to live off-campus but because I've only visited the city once (earlier this week - loved it!) I'm not really familiar enough with the neighborhoods to know where I should be looking.      Can anyone offer up any advice on what neighborhoods or whatever I should be looking for when I'm checking out apartments? (I'm just browsing using Apartmentfinder.com and etc.) I'd love to be able to walk to school and I think living in Bloomfield would be good for that, but again I'm not really sure. Proximity to school isn't really as important as price, though, since I know Pittsburgh has a supposedly bangin' public transportation system.      So to sum up: What neighborhoods or areas do you think I should be looking for an apartment? My dad would love it if I could find a place underunderunder $500 and I'd be happy if it allowed pets, haha.      Thanks!!!

Well anyway, I was wondering if there were restrictions on booking hotel rooms under the age of 16/18 (this is in the UK, if that changes anything). I can understand there being reasons for it, ie. being responsible for ourselves and such. I was just curious (:      (There wasn't a clear category to put this in, sorry (: )
