20090227101638AADsmFv	Computers & Internet;Security	Worrying about stupid stuff?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

20090227095157AAEBd6z	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Windows DHCP server confusion?	We have a windows DHCP server and about 20 PCs.  The DHCP address pool is large.   There is never a shortage of addresses.  At work, my laptop gets a different lP address every day.  At home, my cable router reassigns the same IP address to the laptop, even though I did not explicitly request that.      Why does my laptop get a different IP address at work every day?  I know it is possible to set up a special rule in the DHCP server to assign a static address to a particular PC, but that would be something else to maintain.      Is there a setting in Microsoft DHCP server to prevent it from aggressively rotating and reusing addresses?  I find it strange that a $40 cable router does a better job than the expensive Windows box.

I have a file which was created using microsoft excel 2003 and it is password       protected. now i need to retrieve the password since i have forgotten it. i have       searched for a long time on the net for information regarding the same and i have       used countless softwares for retrieving the password. the problem is that my       password contains alphabets (upper and lower case) and numbers for sure but i am       unsure if it contains special characters. i tried a program which uses brute-      force attack to retrieve but my password length is also long which made the       software using brute force method take more than 14 days but still couldnt       retrieve it. can anyone tell me how to and from where in regedit if at all it is       there, read and decode the password.      if it is not in regedit can anyone tell me where the password is stored and how       to retrieve it?   Its URGENT.      Thank you in advance.

20090307204813AAhHigN	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why is my brand new MacBook so freaking slow?	I just got my Macbook about 4 days ago, and there are times when the Internet specifically runs SUPER slow.  Especially if I'm downloading music, or trying to upload photos, etc.  When this happens, the pages don't load at all, not usually a "slow load", they will just not load whatsoever.  Sometimes when I exit out of the downloading, or uploading, it will speed up again.      I have tried Safari and Firefox to test out if it's just a problem with a specific browser, but it happens on both.  It's not my Internet connection, because on my Vaio I've never had this type of problem.      I'm a new Mac user, I got it because it is industry standard for my field, but if this is how it's going to be I am going to return it and go back to Windows instead.  I would really rather not though, because I love all of the other features of the Mac...maybe I just got a dud?  Suggestions?

I'm writing a program that'll take an input number (example: "19990402") then split it up accordingly: The first four digits are the year, the 5th and 6th are the month, and the 7th and 8th are the day. So it'll take the input, and output "4/2/1999", according to the example.      While the latter part isn't difficult to do, it's the part where I'd take the input, or the variable, and split it up that's giving me issues. Help please!

20090307221204AAqJQwi	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Can you put different size/speed hard drives in a laptop without causing issues?	I have an HP DV9740CA laptop with dual 160GB 7200 RPM hard drives. Recently, I got a Dell Latitude D630 laptop that came with only an 80 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. Since I don't use the secondary HD in my HP laptop at all really, I was wondering if it would cause any potentional issues to the system if I were to install the 80 GB drive into the HP as a secondary drive (so it would have one 160GB 7200 RPM drive and one 80 GB 5400 RPM drive) and install the second 160 GB drive to the Dell? I know this isn't an issue for desktops, but I wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause any issues to my HP notebook.

I was wondering if anyone could help me with this problem in detail how to fix it, I have tried a lot of things and am not sure how to fix the problem

I've recently had my first experience frying a computer motherboard with electrostatic discharge (ESD).

20080309164918AAh16FP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	For Macbook Pro, is 256MB VidRAM enough for me?	I might get a macbook pro (well, we might) if my parents agree that it's worth the money. At first I was thinking the high end model for the larger screen, but 15.4" is good enough (if it's an LED display, then it's great!... Is it?) and now I'm wondering if 256MB of Video RAM will be enough to work with. I will not put on Windows to play games, we  have a Vista comp for that, but I just want to be sure that if I'm editing a 2 hr movie in iMovie (which I probably won't, but it's a good point to set as a theoretical max. in case I get a movie project assigned to me), I don't want it to freeze up or crash or stop or significantly slow down. By the way, what happens when the vRAM is used up? Does it go to the RAM? Because then if I get 4GB RAM for cheaper then it would work well, right? I'm only a kid in high school and my parents don't do serious computer work, but I kinda do. I'm always working on something else big or small here or there and a mac perfectly suits my needs. Please help.

20090307113143AATuazf	Computers & Internet;Security	I need advice on antivirus programs...do i realy need one?	Hello Folks! My included antivirus progam is ready to expire. I bought this laptop recently, and Mcafee was included. I use vista home, and my question is this, I used XP for several years without an antivirus, just ran antispyware and never had a problem. I use Windows Defender and Windows Firewall, and only use webmail, I would truly like to save the space, if its practical. I have heard of Clamwin, and am curious if anyone can give me a few tips....thanks in advance!   G
20090307114657AAOMnUO	Computers & Internet;Security	Strange Windows message... What does it mean!?	I visited a website that I've been on before... And then, suddenly, my broswer closed and there was a message that said:      'Malicious software detected.      Windows might crash!      Windows will now run a virus scan.'      It sounded strange for a Windows message, so I clicked X to close the message, but then it was still 'scanning' my files! I clicked X on that too, but then it came up with another message, similar to the one I had before. But it asked me if I wanted to proceed on closing the window, and I clicked OK...      Now I'm afraid that something might be going on...      I don't know a lot about computers, but I don't go on unsafe sites, so I need to know why I got this...      Besides, I've never read a Windows message before that used an exclamation point. ('Windows might crash!')      Help!
