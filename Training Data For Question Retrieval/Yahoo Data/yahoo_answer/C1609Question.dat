So next year I am going to college, and I applied to a college in Santa Fe, as well as a few in NY.

So...are there lots? Do they mostly reside in caves? Serious answers only, please; I know it sounds really silly but I really am petrified of them and don't want to end up some place where they're everywhere!

20090222141445AAAcXXt	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Saudi Arabia	Important question about saudia arabia, women and islam!?	this is a questions directed towards saudi muslim men...I am a caucasian woman interested in learning and researching about islam and its teachings in its purest form and am interested in inquiring about the religion and its teachings through a shaikh..or an islamic scholar who might be able to answer all my questions to the best of ability. A friend of mines suggested traveling to mecca with her for this very purpose and approach the Meccan scholars for relevant insight..my question is, however, will this be a problem? given that i am a woman will i even be allowed to contact the shaikh if i want to learn more about this religion, in mecca especially, given that the mobility of he female gender is highly restricted in the saudi society without a male counter part..as i do not have one right now...can i make this spiritual quest without many hurdles? how else can i go about this please explain if you are aware!      Thanks.

20090222104925AAoWChJ	Travel;Air Travel	A question for people who fly a lot (especially Tampa Airport)?	I'll be in layover in Tampa for about three hours in March and my parents live very close.  I live in Denver and I'm looking forward to getting to see them.  My mom insists that no one without a boarding pass can visit in the restaurant/gift shop area with passengers.  She seems to think there's no possible way that I can visit with them during a layover.  Maybe she thinks there's a forcefield around the airport keeping passengers in layover from driving down the street or something?      As a kicker, I just recently picked up my boyfriend in the airport twice and mulled around the airport, eating and wasting time in the gift shops while I was waiting for his flight.  I told her that, but she insists it was impossible.      So is it impossible or will my mom have to find another excuse not to see me?

I'm either very nosy or very silly or something beyond that, to ask about British giving birth to Canada July 1, 1867.  But I want to see where this goes.       Do British people think that after forcing Lower Canada to assimilate into Upper Canada, uniting Upper Canada and Lower Canada into one province, that the agreement in 1867 was happier where Canada was granted confederation and Ontario and Quebec took shape, and then other territories joined into the confederation?      Do British people think this Canada turned out rather well? And are British people happy to see the once New France and New Britain fighting over forts in North America have rather settled things in a more peaceful way with Quebec somewhat trying to find its identity in a united Canada?      How do British people feel about this entity of Canada?  Are British happy Canadians joined very fast in WWI and WWII and still have the Queen on their currency and acknowledge the British crown as their head of state? Isn't it good how it worked out? Do British have any regrets?

Im a junior right now going to a pretty big university in OH.  I want to transfer to a university in TX (Houston area) preferably north of Houston (as I recall the only nicer areas of Houston were in the north vicinities Of the city).         I just want to transfer because I miss TX and want to go back (lived in Tomball).  However, I don't know if this is such a good idea from an economic standpoint as I would prob have to wait a year to establish residency in order to pay in-state tuition.  I assume all my credits will transfer as this college that I'm currently attending is a big accredited university and most other large universities generally accept credit transfers amongst each other.      So, please list good universities in nice areas north of houston that I can transfer to.

20090222114336AAKvwpG	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	Is it a good idea to enlarge the E.U. rightnow?	I asked this question in polictics but I'm putting it here too, I'd like to hear the opionion of other Irish people.      I know there are a few countries wanting to join the E.U. but most of them are a few years away from being able to, some are closer.      As a whole I think enlarging the E.U. is a good thing but surely at the moment its a bad idea.       Given that the E.U. is in recession what good would really come from expanding it right now?      Especially allowing Iceland to join, since Iceland is a bankrupt country what good would it really be to the rest of the E.U.?      I'm all for them joining once the recession starts to lift but is there really any good to come from allowing new countries to join during this time of recession?      What are the benefits to the E.U. of enlargement during a recession?      Any economists out there able to shed some light as to why its a good idea?

20090222131320AAQrJSD	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Why does Israel do this?	It is a wonder Palestinians get angry with Israel.      ISRAEL has ordered hundreds of Palestinians to leave their homes in annexed east Jerusalem, warning their houses are illegal.      "The owners of 80 houses in the al-Bustan neighbourhood have received eviction notices saying that the structures will be destroyed because they are illegal," said Hatem Abdel Kader, an official responsible for Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian government.       He said 1500 people were living in the threatened houses in the neighbourhood abutting the Old City.      He said several of the houses served with demolition orders were built before 1967, when Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War but numerous extensions have been built since.

20090222143005AAfZGHw	Travel;Germany;Frankfurt	What Bar/Restaurant is this? Frankfurt Am Main.?	Hello a couple years ago I went to Germany with family and we visited this bar/restaurant in Frankfurt. Its not actually in the "heart" of the city, we had to take a train to get there. The train ride was maybe 5-10 minutes. Not that long.      The restaurant was on a corner. It had a umbrella rack. The bar was lighted. There was a creep old man that stared at us :P      I hope that helps.      Here are the pictures of the restaurant we took.        http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u299/...        http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u299/...        http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u299/...          Thanks in advance.
20090222143031AAhgcWD	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Temperature in America?	Hi guys,      Just wondering, would anybody be able to give me a run down on the weather (generally) from East to West Coast of USA. We're flying into New York March 29th, then driving across to LA, to be in LA by end of April.       I know this is a big generalised question but does anybody know what we should expect from the weather?!      Thanks a lot!
