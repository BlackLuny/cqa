MJ - what are Celtics?- you been watching basketball again?|`|Qd6sTsogaa	Yes that is an amazing song and an amazing sight to see when Liverpool fans sing it at Anfield.

And you're right, it is a great song - mon the hoops!!
R0yzd9rIaa	The eight ways a batter can reach first base are as follows:    1. Hit  2. Walk  3. Hit by Pitch  4. Fielder's Choice  5. Reached on Error (includes MLB Official Rule 7.05 i)  6. Dropped Third Strike  7. Catcher's Interference (hindering the batter while in the batter's box)  8. Fielder's Obstruction (hindering the batter while he is running to first base)    Anything not listed here is either covered in one of the above situations, or isn't a way to reach first base.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Walk  Hit by pitch  Dropped third strike    A balk wouldn't really be the cause batter taking the base. It can result in an automatic ball, which if it's the fourth would be a walk. But it's not the balk itself that does it.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	strike out and run to 1st base because the catcher doesnt catch the ball on strike 3.

On a balk,  he does not advance to 1st.   Only the runners currently on base move up one base.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	dropped 3rd strike i cant think of 5th|`|q3qJIC5raa	walk  hit by pitch  catcher's interference  dropped third strike where he beats a throw to first    only runners on base advance by a balk|`|EcSQ4TAfaa	catchers interference dropped 3rd strike  and most here are incorrect   if there is a balk with the bases empty then u get a free trip to first|`|CshFQShGaa	There is no such thing as a balk with the bases empty, so no, a batter cannot reach base as a result of a balk.     The only other way a player (not a batter, though) can reach base other than what's been mentioned here is to be inserted as a pinch runner.

TAPBWPJLaa	I disagree.     If anything, TNA has been doing any and everything to NOT be like WWE, yet ignorant fans always b*tch and compare it to Vince McMahon's federation. Seriously, what do people want from TNA? They try pushing younger people, everyone complains. They try pushing established names, people complain. They try having different match-types, and people act like everything is a rip-off of something WWE did, like they originated everything in Pro Wrestling.     What do people want from TNA?|`|nzKo4TFvaa	Disagree|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Before they hired Russo i would have gone on an abusive rant at this question but times have changed. At the moment what TNA are doing is Dying WCW days with great wrestling matches thrown in, Russo is Poison to wrestling! TNA does have great matches at PPV's but impact is a poor attitude era rip off and they need to address this. Just because the WWE was a success doesn't mean they need to copy them, they got popular because of what they were doing anyways and that would have grown if they carried on but they decided to hire Russo and it is hurting more than helping.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Disagree    TNA's still a growing company and will eventually be in there league   and  WWE's past its prime and is getting worse|`|gwwvio8Yaa	Wrong     TNA isn't even near WWE standerds they will always be a vastly inferior verison of WCW    at least WCW had some good matches and never had the referers wrestle|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	huh but anyways TNA  is out of wwes league and all ways will be so all you wwe fans need to get over it
ImgbQdrjaa	4 Billion Crackers, I found a huge list of golf courses in Oregon. I'm sure if you called one of the clubhouses they would be able to help you. http://www.tipsonplayinggolf.com/Oregon-...|`|MIAYuO5Vaa	Sandpines Golf Course in Florence, Oregon is a great course. i have played this course many times and you better play it early in the morning to stay away from the windy conditions.  It's a monster in the wind and you better get a power cart.      Rees Jones is the Golf Course Architect and the City of Florence owns the course.  Troon Golf manages the facility.    "Sandpines is, by the very nature of the land, reminiscent of Scottish links-style courses. It brings golf back to its very roots and origins. To see Sandpines for the first time is breath taking. Sandpines should stand the test of time as the great original links have."|`|sBrummATaa	go to their websites and look around. just search the courses on google
3teWTOPqaa	Kobe had a +/- of +19pts    LeBron had a +/- of +7pts    LeBron had the better stat night, but Kobe obviously had the bigger impact on the game. In case you didn't notice, LeBron's big night resulted in a close game, whereas in the previous Cavs vs Knicks game, they blew the Knicks out with ease and LeBron only had a "subpar" game in those matchups.|`|uxregJ0faa	What you mean Lebron helped his team out. Lebrons ''impressive performance'' caused the game to be close. If lebron stuck to his 30 point mark it would have been a blow out. But at least you guys won|`|i5MInqeMaa	People are more impressed with triple doubles.|`|o6fC8LpKaa	because lebron's performance scored more points in my fantasy league than kobe's|`|H1VIZsutaa	Because Lebron actually helps his team out. I you turn those 11 assists into 22 points, he easily beats Kobe, even if Kobe's 3 assists were turned into 6 points.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Nobody really cares how each player do what they did. Kobe took more free throws than LBJ and didn't grab any rebounds nor dished out a lot of assist. LeBron played all the positions that night because the Cavs players were off. Mo Williams, Big Z were missing alot. Ben Wallace doesn't score much. So a wise coach would play his best player in the field to secure the win. Lebron's performance was better because he scored that much points which was only 9 lower than Kobe's and went double digits in rebounds and assists. A 52 point triple double was better than just shooting and ending with 61. I don't hate Kobe and I watch basketball. Kobe came to that game without alot of pressure that LeBron had entering that game. He proved that he can do more than just scoring and that he is the best all around player. Cavs also missed 2 shooting guards in Delonte West and Pavlovic while the Lakers only missed Bynum.|`|fz77R5Jmaa	it was all about the rebounds and assists    i think Kobe's was a lot funner to watch|`|FDl2HUEsaa	lebron had 50-11-10 the first player to have 50 while still getting a triple double since wilt chamberlain WILT CHAMBERLAIN thats like 50 years ago|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Both performances were different.     Kobe- 61 points, 3 assists, 0 rebounds.     LeBron James last year: 50 points, 10 assists, 8 rebounds.   LeBron James this year: 52 points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds.     Kobe is undoubtedly the better shooter, but LeBron has more to offer on different aspects of the game, like passings and rebounding.     Only Wilt, Magic, and Kareem have had 50+ triple double games.     And Kobe holds the all time scoring record at MSG with 61.    Both teams won, and thats all that matters.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	If Kobe got 5 rebounds and 5 assists then his performance would have been better but he had 0 rebounds and 3 assists to go with his 61.|`|6XGcqXQOaa	61 points vs 52 points and a triple double. James had the better overall performance.|`|kKbqdlbnaa	I personally enjoyed Lebron's performance more because I like playing within that team concept rather than playing with the mentality of scoring. I see Kobe as the better scorer, and Lebron as the better overall player.|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	i completely agree with your points made.  lebrons shots also were mainly just layups, not finesse shots.  but in terms of stats you cant deny that his game wasnt impressive.    kobe's purpose in NY was to have fun.  lebron's purpose in NY was to get stats.    so theres a difference.  kobe didnt have the same mindset as lebron did.|`|op4fEbEVaa	Lebron's performance was way better than Kobe's|`|DrawIBPXaa	because lebron had a trible double to go along with 52 points    kobe had 61 with only 1 rebouund 0 assist|`|U5KOQt0Taa	The stats explain it all.

Katich is a very silly boy for doing what he did..(to put it politely too)    EDIT-I just read this in yahoo news and TBH i do not blame Clarkie for wanting it sung,look at what bloody time it was when he asked for it to be sung:---It's believed Clarke wanted the song to be sung by 11pm, five hours after the teams left the field, so he could attend drinks with Bingle and friends.    Custom dictates that the song's "custodian", currently Michael Hussey, dictates the timing of the song.    Hussey did not begin the song until near midnight after the fight had broken out.    (Mate i would have been a little impatient too at 11:00pm at night).    EDIT-Money man i only paste what is written in the news,its each to their own wether they believe it or not.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Yes, but these things do happen in all teams.I think Clarke needs to put the skids under Bingle, she's obviously making too many demands on his time.|`|GGuXJJeAaa	hmmmnn interestin..

f9hiPMDxaa	India are winning and winning well. A good cricketer or cricket team make their own luck. Yes, luck does have something to do with it. But no amount of luck will help a bad team. India is plating very well and on form should beat SRO Lank 5-0.     In this series I haven't seen a team so dominant since our Aussie team in their heyday. India are playing like that. The thought of losing does not appear to enter their minds. he only downside is their fielding. It hasn't made any difference because SRO Lank has been worse in the field but they may well be pushed by a good fielding side.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	I agree with you, I am an Australian and i enjoy watching their (India) aggressive batting and Dhoni does have great leadership. I guess the only thing that turns me off them is some of their fans slagging off other countries|`|1ayvDGcLaa	Not everyone expects India (or anybody else) to be graceful in the face of defeat. but I have a theory why some people might expect it. There is a strange dichotomy about the two faces of India. When people visit India they are met with fantastic generosity and humility. But on the internet one sees (sometimes) a clamor which is very different. And that perhaps explains the expectation you talk about.    I do think India is doing exceptionally well and has done better than other cricketing nations in the last few months.  But I, like, many other people do not congratulate any team and India is no exception.    YA! has been plagued by bad users lately and many users simply prefer to keep their silence.

There is something very wrong about people who say they support cricket and then slag their team off when they don't win - or sledge the other side out of spite.      I am an Aussie and I appreciate good players and love a good match - not winning does not mean that it wasn't entertaining.  Ignore these sore losers and people who say they support the game but slag off world class international players and switch off the TV if there team isn't winning - they are not true supporters of the game.

Indian team has been playing really well of late and deserves the credit  . As far as Dhoni is concerned ,he is a good team captain and a good player ,he wouldn't be there if he had no skills .lets not forget that a Captain can not lead a team to victory on his own, he needs his teams support and their contribution too .Luck and god only help those who help themselves by working hard to achieve their goals ., Any fool knows the fact that NO PAIN would lead to NO GAIN .|`|tz7JEqstaa	I couldn't give a buck toothed rodents rear end about the Indian team.

The PRO Bowl does not mean anything this year and more and likely will mean less next year... not a good idea but they need to make it relevant like NBA and MLB|`|AA12179372	I don't like it, at all! I believe if they are going to make the players travel from August until January, and then if your team makes it further into the playoffs the team has to travel for a couple more additional weeks. I believe you should make the players go to a Pro Bowl in a nice place to visit sort of as a vacation for them and possibly have a Pro Bowl AFTER the SuperBowl. Additionally, if a key player on the SuperBowl team gets hurt during the Pro Bowl, that's a giant hit to the injured players team. But if a player gets hurt in the SuperBowl, no big deal, he can be replaced.|`|4Na1Xc3Gaa	it sucks i know  but its going 2 be here in miami so im excited that i can actually go to one|`|IiX5HeOnaa	this is absolutely a terrible idea!!!

ANSWER: Having no feelings for others, only yourself is what most serial or enjoyment killers have. It is usually called being a sociopaths or psychopath. Not all of them get their kicks from killing but they do enjoy the power of controlling things, animals people or objects, for their own satisfaction.  You do know, don't you, that most serial killers have a history of animal torture (not hunting or killing for food) and fire setting when young combined with a bed wetting problem.

Try a ride DH. Or a Ride dose. dose is wide mid flex freestyle. I use it for everything. custom I think(didnt know they made it in a wide). Its the top selling board and good all around.

mMFJrPbvaa	Nationals Forests are usually free to hike and camp, none of the National Forests I have stayed in required a permit, they just ask that you keep your group size below 6 ro 8 depending on the Forest.    National parks on the other hand require a permit since a lot of people tend to flock to them, tourists etc...think Grand Canyon. This is because they need to control the amount of people impacting the land, whereas the National forest has a fraction of visitors.      Follow the principles of Leave No Trace and you`ll be fine.|`|NrSs1lJgaa	that is something you need to ask your local conservation officer|`|99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	If you look at the USFS website and look for "dispersed camping" there will be links that will have what the regulations are generally then you can email the particular ranger district and ask about the specifics.|`|p2CJ8zNEaa	not  really there are all kinds of regulations governing camping such as being below treeline, outside of forest recovery zones etc. but you are right that back country camping is mostly free.|`|GkqTIGVqaa	You have to buy permits for that type of camping, although they arn't very expensive|`|uzNm9KtYaa	There is a difference between camping in a National Forest and camping in a National Park.  Space in one is considerably less than in the other.  The parks usually have designated campsites available on a first come - first serve basis.  The N/Forests have thousands of acres to choose from and no waiting in line for availability.  Most of the forest areas have a limit of how long you can stay in a camping area, (14 to 16 days) but usually you can move on down the road to a new location and start the count all over again.  There are a lot of options and a lot of state and national forest lands to choose from.  Most of them are free.  The "parks" usually are not.  One of my ALL time favorites in the West is Bridger National Forest near Alpine, Wyoming which is about 30+ miles west of Jackson Hole.  The area is beautiful and there are three significant rivers that converge right there to make for a great area to camp, fish, hike, etc.  The landscape is breathtaking and the camping opportunities are unlimited, pristine, and FREE!  I spent the better part of a month up there off the banks of the Little Gray River.  OUTSTANDING!  You WILL love it!|`|KD943WQuaa	for the most part this is true.there are different rules for different forests but as long as you are 100ft. off the trail or road and 200ft. from a water source it should be safe to camp where you want.i would definitely recommend checking with the forest service first . oh,if you are outside of the set group campgrounds it should be free.

3teWTOPqaa	Even if they had Marion they would still be a first round playoff team last year, and they wouldn't even be in the playoff this year without Shaq. The biggest difference is D'Antoni's system vs Porter's, you see what the Knicks can do with D'antoni's offense.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	He didn't completely ruin them, but he hurt them. His arrival wasn't too bad, but I think Mike D'Antoni leaving is what really messed up the Suns.    Steve Nash used to be able to do it all. He could pass, score, steal, everything. He was amazing under D'Antoni. Now that D'Antoni has left, Steve Nash has done worse. Also, he's getting old. He's starting to decline.    The Knicks have D'Antoni now and they are doing better. I think coaching strategy killed the Suns.|`|qgUHLb6raa	i think becuase shaq doesnt play like a regular sun because they got him for a low tempo game and get more rebounds and stuff like that but i think they were better off without him|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	But didn't Shaq increased the team's rebounding. Plus the duo of Amare and Shaq is really good. The Suns just need to have a better supporting cast. Plus Terry Portr has a different system that Mike D'Antoni.|`|P93I8CHtaa	he cant ruin the suns,he really helps them|`|pgdNUFt1aa	not shaqs fault at all! suns still suck with or without him!|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I don't think he ruined them necissarily. But losing Marion was a big hit to them. He was the guy to do all the little things. I think that's what they are missing the most right now, that and they play alot slower now that they have Shaq.|`|0ylaEVtraa	yes shaq has a  big ego|`|o5gnK15daa	yes a little bit why because he is just not the right fit for phoenix   i hope this helps and please make comments on my sport blog   its always updated every day.am only a kid so check it out on your free time please.sportgeek.blogspot.com|`|ovBNkYtpaa	they should trade SHAQ BACK TO THE LAKERS! ... and no, i dont blame shaq, i blame the new coach.|`|m501HwyWaa	shaq couldnt keep up withe thier fast break offense|`|dDhTMacAaa	In a way? While I love Shaq and admit he is still one of the best big men in the game today, the Suns up-tempo style with Nash and Amare connection + guys like Barbosa, J-Rich now, Bell/Diaw then and Marion then was amazing.    It may have not worked in the post-season as planned, but now they look drained and can't get wins.
2octF5dIaa	He's great.  He had a bad season last year but now he is showing how valueable he is and how smart the Sabres were to spend 50 million on him.

A number of people like the large colorful medals that the Disney World marathon tends to do.    Other marathons certainly have "classier" medals though, or people simply like that they stay relatively constant (like Los Angeles). Sometimes it's something unique like Surf City, or like the Rock 'n' Roll events do. Usually it's a marathon that simply holds someone's PR, or was their BQ time, or was their first, or was outright their medal from Boston.    Anyway, if simply physical appearance, a lot depends on individual taste.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Mine is Boston, There is just that since of pride in myself for that accomplishment, even though it was close to my worse time for a marathon. The whole experience of getting and going there was just awesome.

If someone was having trouble swimming/sinking like a rock (in 5 feet of water =P) one of the lifeguards would hit the emergency stop (for the waves) button then jump in and help the person, the others kept patrolling the pool, it didn't have to be cleared.    However, if someone was found UNCONSCIOUS floating around in the pool, the whistle for EMS would be blown, and the pool would be cleared by whoever wasn't attending to the victim.      It really depends on where you are working at... No idea what they would do at a regular pool. I doubt they would clear the pool unless the person is unconscious, or some other sort of life-threatening happenings were taking place.     There is no need to clear the pool, really, unless the victim needs serious medical attention, or you can't safely access the victim due to there being too many people in the pool.|`|EAvyYtfXaa	Yes...then the other lifeguard should help the rescue lifeguard

HHH said he was a big fan of Hardy and told him he had all the talent in the world. Triple H said he wanted to see Hardy put it all together and be all he can be, so that when he beats Hardy, he knows that he beat the absolute best. Hardy told HHH to take pride in his performance tonight, because he'll take pride in taking HHH's belt.      WWE Women's champ Beth Phoenix (with Santino Marella) vs. Candice Michelle    The announcers noted that Marella must have somehow talked Phoenix in allowing him to come to ringside after she told him on Raw she needed to concentrate on her winning streak. Candice dropkicked Phoenix and promptly missed a legdrop. Ouch. That was grody. Michelle scored several near falls early. Michelle his an enziguiri, and shockingly, Michael Cole called the move. Michelle worked over Phoenix in the corner but was caught by Phoenix and driven backwards into the corner, while upside down.    Phoenix kicked Michelle in the same shoulder she injured. Michelle fought back but was run into the corner by Beth, so her strategy is to go after the bad shoulder. Phoenix followed up with a form of the cross arm breaker.

ECW Title Match: Matt Hardy ? vs. Mark Henry w/Tony Atlas  Twist of fate countered again, Henry tries the slam, countered, twist of fate! 123!  Winner: Matt Hardy @ 8:00 via pin     Eve is with HHH and Jeff Hardy. HHH is texting for the poll, which is who will win between these two. HHH says the only thing Jeff will win is the text poll. HHH says he rooting for him. Jeff says to worry about him, because he's right here. HHH says to calm down and that he doesn't mean any disrespect. Jeff has all of the gifts there are to have, and he wants to see Jeff bring it together on one night. He's no good Samaritan, he just wants to be the best Jeff Hardy. Jeff appreciates that.    WWE Women's Title Match: Beth Phoenix ? w/Santino vs. Candice Michelle   Beth counters the candy wrapper, implant buster and that is all.  Winner: Beth Phoenix @ 4:30 via pin  Kane says it all ends tonight, and Rey understands the truth when he loses his mask. Without Rey, we will all see the false mask of courage that Rey hides behind. The charade will end, and it will all be destroyed. Kane will rip off his mask, and Rey as well as the fans will see what they really are, monsters.    Rey's Mask is on the Line: Kane vs. Rey Mysterio     Rey up topand FLIES INTO A CHAIR SHOT BY KANE! That's a DQ, and that had to suck.  Winner: Rey Mysterio @ 11:00 via DQ   Rey says he can't feel his leg as referees check on him.    -MVP now comes to the ring. He wants everyone's attention, he has an important statement to make. He says you don't sit LeBron James, Peyton Manning or MVP. It would defy explanation. He says this is the last time this happens. The entire WWE revolves around him, but as he tries to continue, Randy Orton and his Tattoos make their way to the ring. Orton introduces himself and then says he is what MVP claims to be. He says maybe there is a reason that this happens to MVP each month. MVP says he didn't recognize him without his sling and MRI results. He then says he is the playmaker, but it is hard to be that when no one gives him the ball. Orton says he would drop the ball if it was given to him. MVP says he is not on Raw, so there are no repercussions if he knocks him out, and everyone on Raw would love him for doing that. This brings out Manu, DiBiase and Rhodes. They tell MVP not to let Orton offend them. He is just doing what he does. Rhodes talks over the boring chants, and says that Orton is that guy that graduated high school, didn't get into college and hung out in his hometown trying to be cool. All Orton has is his reputation. Manu then says the only reason he got to attack Punk was because they did the damage, and Orton picked up the scraps. Orton says once they accomplish half of what he did, he may take them seriously. He bails, and MVP says Orton is the WWE's so-called valuable commodity, and he may wrestle again in 2012. MVP says he likes what they just did, and DiBiase stops him, and says his father was NOT one of the greatest stars on WWE history, which means he is NOT in their class. MVP claims to make more money than all of them, and DiBiase reminds him that his dad is the Million Dollar Man, and he has never worried about money. The dismiss MVP and say they will see him on the next PPV that he is not a part of. MVP claims he will remember this conversation. This now brings out Punk and Kofi. Punk say she has an idea, they talk and tries to work MVP to their side. They rush the ring and Punk and Kofi stop short, and allow MVP to get his rear beat. They then join the battle and clear the ring.      World Heavyweight Title  1 Contender's Match: JBL vs. Batista   Batista bomb connects. 123. Looks like there is no Government Bail-Out for JBL tonight.   Winner: Batista @ 5:00 via pin    The Big Show vs. The Undertaker   Show takes off the turnbuckle pad, slams Taker head first into it and then gets the KTFO punch. KTFO punch again! Show grabs Taker and then punches Taker in the back of the head as he is face down and the match is stopped.   Winner: The Big Show @ 11:00 via referee stoppage   Taker struggles to get to his feet after the match, he looks like he just took an *** whooping from Anderson Silva.     Jeff Hardy won the text poll with 72%.    WWE Title Match: HHH ? vs. Jeff Hardy  Hardy up topSWANTON MISSES~! Kick, wham, pedigree countered again, TWIST OF FATE! Hardy up topSWANTON!

They keep pulling, Jericho with all of his weight, Jericho pulls HBK in, head butts him and Jericho falls with the title!  Winner: Chris Jericho @ 23:00

AA10093615	Most art on surfboards are painted on before the fiberglass and resin are layed down. That's why the artwork doesn't come off. Many people airbrush directly on a shaped, blank (foam). You can also do your art on a sheet of fiberglass and laminate it during the glassing. That's how the sponsors are able to put their logos on the boards.  I suggest your boyfriend hook up with a shaper and he can do art work before the board is glassed.|`|xhPKkkELaa	Unfortunately, that is not  how surfboards are made. Also, you don't spend $6/700. for art. Surfboards are works of art in their shape and design and fiberglass work. Neat art work on the board is a nice addition, but not what people buy surfboards for. Look up on line how surfboards are made, and you'll understand. If you live in a surf oriented area, perhaps he can hook up with a shaper and do art work for him.|`|ZcZ86Sgdaa	To make a longboard you have to make it You cant buy it blank then paint it because it is already wrapped in fiberglass|`|jowVkROYaa	No, because you are reshaping it right??

YES.   ...there was and will be only one Michael Jordan.   ...there was and will be only one Kobe Bryant.    IM NOT AGREE....    Kobe would only win another title if he has a big man wit him...  NO.  That is only a point of view, because Jordan was always surrounded by very good players, stars like Pippen, Harper, Rodman or Kukoc.  But Kobe.???   Kobe doesn't have anyone in the Lakers since Shaq.  Odom.??? inconsistent.  Gasol.??? very soft.  K Brown.??? the biggest clown in the world.    So, tell me who is the Pippen in the Lakers and I will be 100% agree with you.    ------------------------------
YFE3pCM6aa	I think he is either talking about Vince, or 'Taker.  I bet since Regal is almost done with his suspension, he will beg the McMahons to be GM again.|`|7AwTFu1eaa	I think his talking to undertaker or will bring his mask back|`|FuTfCWCjaa	i think its his father Paul bearer  u know the fat guy with the urn|`|AA11498774	HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CENAS SEX LIFE|`|6hqySdTSaa	I think his talking to undertaker or will bring his mask back|`|o6g6KepGaa	Okay ... People have asked this, But I'll answer anyway,    I saw a interesting answer earlier that he could be talking about himself    At first I thought he was talking about Taker but considering Taker is banished from the wwe and not dead, It's a small possibility    Then he could be talking about Vince but he isn't dead either so it cant really be him|`|AA11105044	kane will return in his mask and the rock is gonna be the new raw gm|`|9b571bc922dccaca55473f65c20da8f4aa	hes probably talking about Vince.|`|xScTrzsuaa	maybe he was talking about him old self, the "attitude era kane" or either is old father paul beaur, i dont know what was going on, but i hope he do it more often, it was very interesting!!!|`|RG1X0DPIaa	I really don't know, there is only 2 possible answers, Himself or Paul Bearer, remember paul was encased in cement by the Undertaker, but himself coming back with the mask seems to be the most appropriate thing to do. He needs to get the burning fire of rage back!   or mabye the WWE is trying to see what the fans want so they can make it happen and keep us happy.  Hey you never know.

But I still like him.|`|9UREbZtVaa	I think he is a great wrestler.  He definitely deserves a better WWE Championship run than what they gave him in 1998.  He can make for a popular heel character like the gimmick they gave him when he first came into the WWE.

Jamie Noble and Mickie match- It was great noble proved himself worthy.    8 Man tag match- Was awesome we all actually saw a little of what manu  can do.

By James Caldwell of PWTorch.com    The Raw before the No Mercy PPV started with Michael Cole introducing the most momentous week in WWE history. Cole and Jerry Lawler talked about Michaels being allowed to choose a mystery partner tonight to face Jericho and Cade. Also, WrestleMania 24 sneak peek tonight ahead of the network TV debut of Mania on MyNet later this week.    In-ring: Batista then started things off by coming to the ring for the opening contest. Cole and Lawler hyped Batista vs. JBL in a  1 Contender match at No Mercy on Sunday. Santino Marella then came out with Beth Phoenix to match up against Batista. Two weeks without Santino has been unbearable. Santino said before they engage in battle, Batista might want to see something. Cue up the Honk-a-meter where Santino has only 58 weeks to become greatest IC champ of all the time.    Santino then introduced his newest graphic, the Brain Barometer. He said the average human brain has 6 trillion brain cells. Meter has Santino with 10 trillion cells. But, ole Batista only has 12 brain cells. Batista just laughed at this. Santino vowed to knock out 10 of the 12 right now. He said he is going to leave Batista in worse shape than the U.S. economy. Too soon. Too soon. Batista just laughed and warmed himself up until Santino entered the ring.    1 -- BATISTA vs. IC champion SANTINO MARELLA (w/Women's champ Beth Phoenix)    Batista quickly smashed Santino with a forearm smash before warming up for the Batista bomb. Batista nailed the finisher with an eye on Beth, then Batista made the cover for the quick win. Afterward, Beth hopped onto the apron to voice her displeasure with Batista's work in the ring. Suddenly, JBL snuck into the ring from behind and knocked a few brain cells with the Clothesline from Hell on Batista. JBL stared down at Batista's fallen body, then he slowly walked out of the ring. JBL looks like he's lost a little weight and appears to be in better shape than I last remember.    WINNER: Batista in 1:00. Quick, effective opening match. Santino is expected to talk and get his rear end handed to him, so that was fine. JBL with a nice set-up for No Mercy with Batista seeking revenge. (n/a)    Backstage: Todd Grisham brought in Shawn Michaels to talk about the tag match tonight involving Lance Cade. Michaels said he knew Lance Cade was good 10 years ago when he trained him, but he didn't realize it would be shown at his own expense. Michaels then hyped the ladder match at No Mercy and guaranteed victory. Grisham asked who the partner will be tonight.    Michaels said Batista has his hands full tonight, so he's given it some thought and this is what he's come up with... How about a tag team alliance with a real American? (Hogan.) How about HBK and a Texas Rattlesnake? (Austin.) Or the Best there is, the best there is, and the best there ever will be? (Hart). No dice. Michaels realized this wasn't working, so he suggested he's going to find someone who actually... likes him. Michaels gave a big shrug and walked off the set.    [Commercial Break]    In-ring: Cryme Tyme came to the ring out of the break. J.T.G. is in singles action tonight. The Miz then came out with John Morrison as the opposition. Word Up vs. the Dirt Sheet tonight. They even gave us a clip of a recent Dirt Sheet with Miz and Morrison suggesting JTG was crapped out in a toilet at birth. I sure haven't missed the potty humor.    [Q2]    2 -- JTG (w/Shad Gaspar) vs. THE MIZ (w/John Morrison)    Miz was his usual annoying self early on with some mockery of JTG in between working him over on the mat. Morrison then tried to provide a distraction at 3:00, but Shad knocked him off the apron. Meanwhile, Miz caught JTG in the ring with the Reality Check high knee and neckbreaker combo for the pin and the win with Shad too late re-entering the ring to make the save. Miz and Morrison had the final word over Cryme Tyme tonight.    WINNERS: Miz & Morrison in 3:00. Fine little tag team rivalry brewing on the undercard. Too bad they're on separate brands to continue muddying the brand split. But, at least there's focus on the tag division. Gotta take it however it comes. (1/2*)    Backstage: Jamie Noble walked up to Jillian Hall, who was checking herself out in the mirror. Noble said he doesn't need any singing tonight, but he does respect her wrestling ability. Noble asked Jillian to be his tag partner tonight in an inter-gender match, but Jillian suggested Noble is a loser. Suddenly, ole Dolph Ziggler interrupted and shook Jillian's hand while flashing a bright smile. Noble wasn't impressed by him. Jillian just looked lost. Or maybe that was the botox talking.    [Commercial Break]    ECW promo: ECW is moving to 9:00 p.m. EST starting next week. Meanwhile, more hype for Hardy vs. Henry set for No Mercy.    In-ring: Jamie Noble came to the ring for the inter-gender deal to face Paul Burchill and Katie Lea. Noble apparently didn't have a partner, then William Regal's music hit and Regal came out on stage with Layla to watch from his throne. Just as the match was set to start, Mickie James came out as Noble's partner. Noble was rather pumped at this prospect.    [Q3]    3 -- JAMIE NOBLE & MICKIE JAMES vs. PAUL BURCHILL & KATIE LEA    Noble started things off to set up a tag to Mickie, who was quickly tripped up by Burchill behind the ref's back. Katie then worked over Mickie while Regal and Layla watched with interest from the stage. Noble eventually took a tag and slammed Burchill with a rolling side suplex before going up top for a missile dropkick. Noble made a cover, but Katie broke up the pin. Mickie then nailed Katie with a top rope splash before flinging her over the top rope to the |`|IMu3wBu8aa	Raw is always awesome!   Nice Avatar :)|`|euo0j3NTaa	Yes.

Tough one to answer!!! NOTTTTTT!    He was given a rough deal by Rafa and as a Reds supporter, I'm rather upset that they discarded him as he is a great player, albeit that his goal celebration is terrible...LOL.    He won't score against us on the 24th... He'll be man marked from leaving the change rooms until he gets into the shower afterwards.  "you'll never walk alone!"|`|aGXankr2aa	No, we'll have the title wrapped up before then.  Could be that we send Spurs down on the last day of the season though - so in one season Keane gets relegated and a Premier League winners medal.|`|NJkvPtU9aa	Torrard, Lfc's answer-that says it all.|`|ph58F3Dqaa	he wouldnt do it to his beloved team|`|x7G5lrMBaa	Liverpool would be out of the title race by then... so whether robbie scores or not, it doesnt make any difference..

He's done horrible at Liverpool, but at Spurs he was a hero.|`|NJkvPtU9aa	yes but it's a real shame he missed out on Liverpool's bound Champion's League, Premier League and Fa Cup treble.   And anyway he'll still win a cuo this season at spurs but people say this cup is a mickey mouse cup for crap teams like Manshit United. But then again, if you look on the bright side, the Carling Cup is definitelty there's, considering they're only playing against a mediocre referee-favouring team. Hopefully though for once, we will get a neutral referee for the game.|`|N7fNwIQSaa	He can win the League Cup again if he wants to or he can go for the big stuff....however hes made up his mind|`|nev2yuZ7aa	The muppet is cup tied for the carling cup, so there is always next season to add to his trophies, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha fat chance|`|z5EK19s5aa	yeah in any case, its a smart move

Because there was no "Big Bang", Chuck Norris just roundhouse kicked the universe in the face and said, "Get a job!"    But seriously, what's the point of the this question? Everyone has a different definition of toughness. Somebody will always say that a person is tough or isn't.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I seriously doubt that this guy is telling the truth.

Chuck is a great role model for martial artists everywhere and a wonderful person who is not full of ego. He is great at martial arts and a very talented athlete. I seriously doubt that he would be found fighting in a bar...at least not since he was in his early 20's. |`|3DnX9NmAaa	No.|`|43af235f95ec4af6738a77d6e2c4cdc6aa	chuck norris is a ginger    steven siegel..now that's a tough dood|`|EfcS6HwJaa	chuck norris is going to round-house kick you for this question.|`|52aApICbaa	LOL! I guess that wasn't the real Chuck Norris. The real Chuck must've been disguised as the dude who won. maybe it's just part of his plan to make people wonder just how tough he is.|`|26b727784ab6c6917ee0c334293b7446aa	Ah.......Norris doesn't strike me as the fight piking type so, I know the question is a joke.    However.........    A similar incident like that one DID happen to Jean Claude Van Damme, and I think it happened in an exclusive NYC bar actually, where a bunch of Hollywood celebs were partying way back when in the early 1990's when Van Damme was big, or, at least, SOMEBODY.  Story goes that a stuntman, can't remember if he was an NYC native or California, was being harassed by Van Damme.  Van Damme was a big shot hollywood star, and the stuntman was, well, just a stuntman, and Van Damme was letting him know it, so you can imagine where this is going.  See what Van Damme did not know, was the stuntman was a state Kickboxing champ, not sure if it was Muay Thai or one of those exotic brutal martial arts but the man could fight, and when Van Damme was laid out with a lightning fast blow so quick no one could see the stuntman's fist, Van Damme finally left him alone after he woke up 5 minutes later.    The stuntman was asked to leave immediately by the bar's staff, Van Damme himself stayed and signed autographs but later left, too humiliated to stay there and likely realizing that his career as an action star was over.  See, there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood, even if you do "fake" martial arts movies, you need to be able to fight for real, or people won't watch.    Bruce Lee for instance, because he was Chinese, had little appeal here, and in China itself, people didn't know who the hell he was at first.  When he became famous though, people constantly harassed him, and one time, a Chinse Kung Fu expert actually invaded his house when he was spending time with his wife and children.  Bruce Lee was so furious, he kicked the man in the chest breaking his sternum, miraculously, the man survived, but he was getting harassed so much he moved the family to the U.S. having amassed a small fortune.  When Enter the Dragon rolled along, people knew Lee could fight, as before he got into movies, he was well known in the martial arts and most importantly, street brawler community (mostly black people) who could vouch for the fact that he could fight.    Chuck Norris, is I believe a former world Tang Soo Do Champion, and one of the few non-Koreans to hold the equivalent of a 9th dan rank, so his skills, even though not in "real fighting" are well known.    See Van Damme, his reputation was questionable, and it was later discovered that he never was a champ, and that he learned most of his Karate from Frank Dux, who was also a fraud.  Dux called his style "Dux Ryu" when in fact its Shotokan.  Dux never learned from some Japanese refugee or secret family system, he earned his black belt from a pot-bellied WWII veteran who had been stationed in Okinawa.  Now, Frank Dux IS indeed a skilled Shotokan stylist, albeit, not a very honest one.    So, your "joke" actually did happen, it was namely the movie career ending incident that basically washed up actor Jean Claude Van Damme.  The reason Van Damme looks as good as he does, is because he incorporated a lot of ballet into his movie kicks, but many of those pretty flying kicks you see in his movies, don't actually exist in Shotokan Karate, and in Kung Fu, the form is totally different.  Word of the wise to any would be future Hollywood action stars; win a few tournaments first, before the age of 24 if possible.  While the movie industry, ironically enough, is one of the most secure career paths there is, as there is always some show or movie that needs an old man, or a middle aged man, and so on, being a movie STAR, isnt' so secure.    That is to say, actors act for a long time, but few will get to be celebrities for very long, and they often have no choice but to keep acting long after their celebrity status is over.  Someone should have warned Van Damme about that, before picking a fight with that guy; I mean for christ's sake the stuntman (and this is true, from eye witness accounts) told Van Damme to leave him the hell alone like, I think 14 times.  Being the turd that he is though, Van Damme did not listen and that was the end of his movie career far as the action public was concerned.|`|6nGII584aa	chuck norris can carry more than 6 pokemon|`|atcQWLXaaa	That was just one of his doubles that he sounds out to do humanly things like go to bars, so he can seem more like the average american.

SLvstq4qaa	JBL's year long WWE Championship title reign was broken by John Cena at WM 21 not Batista who defeated Triple H at the same event but for the World Heavyweight Championship.  IMO Triple H has to drop the title soon. I can't remember the last time he was beaten cleanly in a match as WWE Champion.  I acknowledge what he has done for the WWE but I feel it is time for younger talent like Jeff Hardy,Kozlov and Shelton Benjamen to win a few World Championships and not keep giving them to older wrestlers. |`|25b48f650f327efbc725c9afd7a633fbaa	i like triple h but i think its time for jeff hardy to get the title|`|zXpbfBcuaa	i think he will hold da title wayyyyyyy longer den jbl then lose it       !-HHH FAN 4 LIFE-!|`|FEViNlQMaa	Abusive because he did not gave pity to Jeff|`|D8jcgdcpaa	I think he is greedy|`|XEGBUFwAaa	My General Opinion of Triple H:      To be completely honest I just don't think he is as good as he thinks & says he is. I think he is overrated & boring. I just change the channel when he rants about how "great" he is.    Most people think I dislike Triple H because "he is married to Stephanie McMahon" but the truth is I have disliked Triple H when he was a face wrestler one part in the late 90's before the whole Stephanie & Triple H thing came into play. I have always had the same opinion about Triple H for the past 10 years.      EDIT: Truth: stop lying. No one believes trolls.    LOL, some Triple H fans are extremely sensitive.|`|AA11105044	he will keep the title until next years summerslam|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Triple H is one of the best of the business and without him, WWE will never be the same; think about all the croud he draws to the wwe.

Very intense and great in the ring..    Will he beat JBLS record? I doubt it, i am pretty sure before 2009 he will drop the title. There are to many superstars to not drop it, shelton, Hardy, Taker etc...
Ar5IuU2Uaa	Length depends completely on the skis - if you are renting a general all mountain carver then 165-170 should be perfect, racers can argue over cm's but it will never make a massive difference. Standard rule is too short can put excess pressure on the knees (hence why minimum FIS lengths for Slalom have come up) - too long can make it hard to turn. If in doubt stick somewhere between the chin to eye level.     Ski poles are fairly simple - ask the ski tech in person as 5'8 could still vary wildly based on body/arm length, if you really want to you can check out this site:  http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/ski-poles/s...|`|OrG2fBbKaa	The 170 cm ski is just about the proper length, maybe a little longer in the near future. The 46 cm poles are way too short unless you are doing something in the Park and Fall terrain.  Even then you'll find them short.  Try a pair of 44 to 48 inch and trim  to length.|`|DhEZj9cKaa	Ask a ski tech|`|wmyew1ERaa	Skis today should be between 160 and 170cm. Some say they should come up to your chin. Sometimes it depends on what kind of skis you are getting. All mountain? Maybe 170cm. Slalom? Maybe 155 to 160cm. And so on.     Poles? 46cm? These would be a bit short. Try 46 inches. Probably pretty close. I'm 6' tall and use 48" to 50" poles.|`|k1C70y8raa	im telling you right now that if your going to ski on 170cm ski's, you shouldnt expect yourself to be carving.  i am a ski racer and my slalom skis are 165, and very easy to manuever for the length due to the racing tune they have, with 170's you will probably have to slide your tails. if you have no intention of learning to carve, then by all means get the 170's but if you plan on carving go with a shorter more shaped ski for easier turns.

5981536910b10187bd7f11cb716c6f18aa	HUSTLE    do as man little things as possible as well as shooting when open and finding the open man.  Coaches like unselfish players but if you have a good shot make sure you show it off when you are open or if you can beat your opponent drive right by them but then if the hoop isn't there don't force it but pass to a post player.    If you are a post player run the floor as hard as you can and try to get as good of position as possible.  Make sure you box out on rebounds and contest shots.    Basically play to your strengths, and do the little things if you don't already like diving for loose balls, cuase jump balls, hit the open man, set good screens, and try to limit turnovers.    Good luck|`|6UUsFFnOaa	Depends, do u have a freshmen team, jv or varsity team? usually to make freshmen or jv tem u need to make a foul shot, a ly up, have speed and indurance, be able to drible, pass and learn drills! good luck, hope u make it !|`|UryACfe6aa	Ability in the sport then it's usually by popularity or who's the parent.    Why don't you go and talk to the coach in question and ask them what they'd like and what you could do to improve your chances of making the team.|`|851iD1uDaa	They want hard work and an ability to listen.  If the coach tells you to change your game somehow, do it.  They love to see improvement.  Give 110% in every drill, scrimage, and game.  Another thing to make sure you do is always listen.  If the coach tells you how to run a play, you better know how.  If he sees you messing around with friends, he will probably make a mental note of that.  Good luck.|`|P50ycFQbaa	If u work and get into the best physical shape  u can that will show a lot to him because you will be able to run faster than the older girls,,,, also just sit down and watch a college game or two u will began to undestand the game a lot better|`|323ff67a96124441f307fe2f6943dedbaa	I have coached a basketball team for a few years now and what I want to see most out of players when selecting them to a team is first and foremost natural talent. If one is not blessed with the talent my best advice would be to hustle at all times, show energy, and be a leader. Also, some other tips would be to not make bad judgment calls/mistakes such as getting out of control, or making a bad pass. Most of all I would be looking for someone with a desire to play, desire to become better, and somebody trying harder than everyone else (especially on the defensive end)

E X QUEST'ANNO...spero 1 giovane come Messi o Cristiano Ronaldo|`|2yttBrhXaa	No, l'avrebbe dovuto prendere Buffon perche' a parte di essere bravo quanto Cannavaro ha deciso di rimanare alla Juventus anche se era retrocessa in B dove ha accumulato piu' gloria, mentre Cannavaro per tutte le qualita' che ha da mercenario se ne e' andato in Spagna dove ha avuto una stagione insoddisfaccente.

AA10682090	I'd move Sexon for a bullpen pitcher and an outfielder.    If this is a fantasy team, Sexon's 170 strikeouts are going to hurt as much as his 40 homers and 108 rbi's help.  You've already got 2 first basemen, plus Haffner, who's allegedly a first baseman too.    But you need pen help.|`|851iD1uDaa	If you can get any closer for Sexon, that would be good.  Lidge could go either way this year and Gonzalez is less than a premium reliever.  Get another closer for one of your infielders, preferrably Sexon.|`|tXM9Gr3saa	Well, you might wana get Billy wagner, or Mariano rivera, cause you need at least 8 releif pitchers to have a good roster, and i would trade freel, or derosa for ichiro, beltran, vlad guerrero, or damon or ramirez, there all the top outfielders, but if you want a young minor leagure i would get melky cabrera. He is very good in defence, and probably beltran is good in offence, and ichiro has speed.

AA11586026	i have to say furcal he has one of the best arms i have seen. in his first game back from injury this year i saw him dive on the floor turn around throw to first base and make the out. Also i saw a play where he was in left field on the grass and still managed to get the baserunner out this guy makes plays i never thought were possible so furcal by a long shot|`|19nQDjEmaa	Neither!

I think Furcal is overall a better SS but Uribe is a close close second.|`|FmSXALJpaa	Rafael Furcal, He's been kind of hurt in LA but if u see the range he had in Atl., its not even close.|`|851iD1uDaa	Vladimir Guerrero has been clocked from the outfield at speeds of 106 MPH!!!|`|L5pJSaktaa	I think you also have to consider Vlad and Ichiro in that argument.    I would say Vlad has the strongest arm in terms of raw power but Ichiro is more accurate and throws almost as hard.  Furcal and Uribe are both tough as well.    Here, in my opinion, are the toughest arms to run against (strength + accuracy considered)    1. Ichiro  2. Vlad  3. Uribe  4. Furcal|`|wO39OIgkaa	Rafael Furcal...... most deniatly|`|e36e69202a58f8efbafe141bc0f586c1aa	Vladimir Guerrero!!!

Not even Lebron can do that.|`|jiIQaXrnaa	first off that proably will never happen. and if it did then yeah it would be a 3 pointer bcuz its behind the 3 point line|`|8Ax7i7hqaa	If that were possible then yes it would, the last place your feet touch  when the ball leaves your hands is how the points are scored|`|5C5spDBdaa	even if it is, its never gonna happen|`|lmBLlzfbaa	yes it is. but that's impossible to do.|`|0h20qaxtaa	You should be banned from Yahoo Answers for asking this question.|`|yy1m4KNaaa	As long as they start before the 3 point line and dont land b4 the ball goes in the net then it is a 3 pointer

Seriously, i think you mean what football position(s) will his   child(ren) play. Probably Tight End because AJ is a beefed up LB and Quinn is of course a QB and is tall , which means the child will have good hands, good height, and good strength. All of those things being criteria for a great Tight End.|`|07bec0fbddc15a213ae8bb72a5d2a374aa	AJ is gonna be a linebacker and his wife is gonna be the quarterback. AJ's job is to slam Laura down hard as many times as he can.|`|b7fbfc9c56eae31b2d4dd35d20c58442aa	linebacker or quarterback........prob a safe beat......if hes taller then maybe tight end......if he is smaller then maybe free safety........or he could be a no talent pussy and live off of daddy's money.
67eb1e4855fbbd1c5305adc6026dce4faa	Probably Chucky. Faneca will play out his contract, so this year shouldn't be a problem. Mahan can play guard & will probably be groomed for that, but the Steelers also have some good young "O" linemen coming up. As long as they stay reasonably healthy, they should be OK.|`|XZk7FztIaa	Who cares they will still miss the playoffs|`|laP15c8raa	the best man

El7C2JsMaa	@ Enigma - that clean sheet fact isn't really relevant to who's the better defender and i'll show you why...    in the time Rio has been at Man Utd (since 2002) Man Utd have conceded 178 goals in the league, in that same time span Liverpool have conceded 199 goals, but seeing as Carragher had two massive injuries in the first couple of years and wasn't always a recognised CB i'll start the facts from the 04/05 season when Rafa arrived and made him into a CB.  Goals Conceded:  04/05   Liverpool - 41  Man Utd - 26   05/06   Liverpool - 25  Man Utd - 34  06/07   Liverpool - 27  Man Utd - 27  07/08   Liverpool - 28  Man Utd - 22    in total Liverpool have conceded 121 goals and Man Utd have conceded 109 goals, FACT!    Now i'm sure you could now find different stats that prove i'm wrong and then i'm sure i could find different stats to counter you again, which prove one thing, stats don't really mean a lot and to prove it heres another fact Wes Brown has won 14 pieces of silverware at senior club level and Jamie Carragher has won 11 so does that mean Wes Brown is better than Jamie Carragher? Derby County had more points at this stage last season than Spurs do now does that mean Derby are better than Spurs (OK bad example) People can use stats to prove anything it doesn't make them right!    Basically there is no way anyone can convince you Rio is better and there is no way you could convince me that Carragher is better its just personal opinion and that is... FACT!    There is one thing i will admit to Carragher being better at though, he managed to score 2 own goals when Man Utd played Liverpool in 1999 not even Wes Brown can match that!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Well, i'm neutral and i think Carragher is better than Ferdinand and Gerrard is better than Hargreaves|`|Q3hOqlOTaa	I just love Liverpool    -keeps his glasses on-    But looking at past records, goals conceded etc etc...Carra is better.  Dont hate me for it though :D|`|64M2xWyAaa	id be upset if you believed ferdinand was better then a hamster|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	carra scores more goals than ferdinand but they are usually in his own goal ha ha ha , yes they should wake up and smell the coffee|`|JsxuCDSJaa	yes liverpool strike force are as good as there defence hence no league titles for 18 years|`|OpOGla2baa	they are angry because you support man united and they support liverpool    most liverpool fans think ferdinand is better than carragher anyway|`|meC3epv6aa	I Will Kick UR A**  IF U COMPARE GERRARD WITH OWEN      STEVE.G AND CARRA THEY BOTH R BEST|`|bWIkuKxdaa	You can say that you ruffled a few feathers. Even burst some bubbles. Or even woke them up from fantasy land.    Carragher ahead of Ferdinand are stuffs made for FANTASY football.    Like when I manage a team for FIFA 06 and kicks ar.se, I am the best manager of the world. LOL.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Do I need to show you again?? Read the facts I put forward again!!    FACT: According to reliable and respected sources of data, Carragher is a better defender than Ferdinand!!    You can't argue with that!!      What the hell are you talking about you idiot!! Look at what Nick and dan said!! Carra is better!! Are you blind aswell as stupid?? looooooooooooool, idiot!!|`|fEWhwumZaa	No.  That's your opinion so I don't think anyone would be upset at you?    Would you be upset if I said Torres was better than Rooney? |`|IlDD3qumaa	Lol comparing carragher to ferdinand is a insult.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	No were not upset at that comment you believe what you want and we will too i think ferdinand is lazy and a bottler but thats up to me and you can agree or disagree thats what freedom of Speech is     I have not told you to stop saying anything you can say what you want bud but i just thought you might be getting bored of it. You know it works both ways as i said alot of united fans would rather a team of garry glitters to win then liverpool
4VoQduaZaa	Congrats to Murali for reaching the milestone. I think he deserves every bit of it. It is not easy to take that kind of criticism in your stride and still be where he is now. A weaker heart might have left playing. He is one of the all time greats .. there is no doubt about that.|`|MwjDCSLpaa	Well done.

My spies tell me Fergie's cunning new plan is for Ronaldo to start games lying down - only getting up when the ball comes his way and no opposition player is withinn 15 yards of him.  It's legal (if the boy doesn't feign injury) and will ensure no harm will come to his precious twinkle toes before the move to Real Mad.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	lmao he is so blatent about it now he knows he will constantly get away with it|`|AnEccEHBaa	lol he is a diver i am not surprised lol|`|JsxuCDSJaa	he dribbled himself into the corner so he took the fall you would of been stupid not to...|`|d249327bb8b9be89e88a359ce5e59a58aa	ronaldo diving- oh surely not! and wasn't this the ref man u said was biased to chelsea??  time for some fa action - laugh - at the beginning of the season,  just pray drogba doesn't start doing it again - soooo embarassing.
RNr2xeDHaa	Come over to our Country Audi .... im sure you'll find many willing Arsenal supporters to have a relationship with .... im still convinced i can change Tyler over to a Gooner! lol! ;-P    |`|nwwhfuADaa	because theres fans like you and touz who keep on slating us  we are being generous to you but you are mean to us|`|uNcJYqEOaa	You know, I don't mind banter, but I actually think this anti-Arsenal thing is making us Liverpool fans look bad. We are kicking teams whilst they are down. I think we should be making fun of teams like United that need a ref to get 3 points. I always get on well with Arsenal fans.|`|tNSYW2p7aa	Because they're always compiting ever other everytime|`|DFb9wK5Saa	it is because a Liverpool Supporter can't have a meaningful loving relationship|`|70e18defb7733240aab32903d8fc209aaa	That is because the team that each support is FIGHTING on the field, giving a "wrong message" to the supporters... I am thinking a loving relationship can be seen if the members of the teams also *love* each other on the field... And, nah, that is not gonna happen. |`|uTvzu2PIaa	I'm a huge Liverpool fan who lives with a huge Arsenal fan. He's one of my best friends. I'm also friends with Manchester United fans. Just because they're wrong doesn't mean I can't be friends with them ;)|`|jxKX8iAqaa	as long as they are over 18 i dont see why not! it would be preferable to a manu,everton or chelsea fan thats for sure! :P|`|vXPNx7z2aa	looool     move over here the age is 16 i think ....means you will only have to wait a few more years for them to be over 16 ...    btw i didn't think a Liverpool support could have a meaningful loving relationship with anyone!!! (lol)|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	There was me thinking scousers were funny and original and that little joke was neither.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Look in a mirror and find out|`|u9k4Orvpaa	welcome to the world of audi and touz xenia ...they are both a couple of barnpots ... lol..|`|uUitKmJMaa	cuz asrenal suuporters are so like, o we play great football, and all that crap!  and i personally think thats annoyin the way the rave about there team playing good football.  sure we mite not play as good football as team,but were certainly getting better results then them!|`|JsxuCDSJaa	i also think that scousers never shut up about torres scoring goals and that your gonna win the league with twinkle toes and torres upfront
zLgs3M6jaa	Chelsea does not need all those signings.  We need a striker.    The only one I agree with you on is Pato.   Thats it.    We dont need the rest. |`|D0SgpVWyaa	Money does buy u the players n thier quality that they can produce on the field but that only brings u problems. if u buy pato to chelsea, do u think the other players ll keep quiet. he ll demand huge wages n the likes of terry or lampard ll be pissed off as they might earn lesser than him. most of the times, its tough to stars to gel into another star team coz of thier differenence in freedom of the game. Despite this all, i wuld love Bentiez to sign   - Simao  - Joe cole  - David Villa     if them, liverpool can sure to mount serious title challengers rather than a dark horse in the race.  |`|1b78e73a67c296bc63fce67394862c54aa	hey how many players more do u chelsea fans  want|`|uUitKmJMaa	i want liverpool to sign Ageuro him and torres would be deadly|`|UrpxXDPSaa	I am an Arsenal fan and it seems strange that you want Chelsea to buy Nasri and Vela. I think Chelsea would benifit more from buying Adebayor or Bendtner as they are strong strikers. I want Arsenal to buy Bojan from Barca or Alexander Pato from Milan as they both have great potential, a strong defender like Rio or John Terry and most of all I want Arsenal to buy Flamini back or if not Miguel Veloso.|`|fR6ZUMJeaa	I want AC Milan to buy:    Fernando Torres from Liverpool  Arjen Robben from Real Madrid  Carlos Tevez from Man Utd  Yaya Toure from Barcelona|`|nJ5kceMBaa	You're living in dream land!! You really think ac milan will sell you their star prospect and arsenal will sell you two players they've only just brought to the club?? No way!!|`|JsxuCDSJaa	well we would of had bosingwa if chelsea didn't steal him from us at the last min lol

I think it would be good as we can then judge to how good they really are against the top English teams.    There was an idea a while back that they would start in the Championship  then see how they get on. Personally I think they both could get into the top 10 of the English Premier League.|`|XKQggWUGaa	well, caltic and rangers in the premier league sounds appaetising, but the SPL would go down the tube and the the premier league would become over competetive, i could see the european cup being the mainstay of a clubs income and celtic and rangers having to go without silverware for a good while bar cup competitions|`|EDoiMKy8aa	Why just celtic and rangers? How unfair is that? What about hearts and hibs? What about just having a national league? After all................. We are GREAT BRITAIN........ AREN'T WE?|`|1FWIq6oPaa	Celtic would be a positive as we've proved with our resources and following we can give a good account of ourselves anywhere!!       Rankers would be a negative as they would only get English teams barred from Europe with their drunken riotious behaviour and set you back 30 year... fact!   |`|AEK3Gaa6aa	Neither of them are good enough to win the league so why would they give up all the 'glory' they currently earn in a league where they have no chance of being overtaken, to going to a league where they wont make top 4 ?    We can see the difference between the two leagues by their European successes.    Don't shout at me either, I'm Romanian and look at it from the neutral point of view, Hail Hail, lmao, Ooooops    |`|eeahTgpnaa	you jocs couldnt join the big league, you would better of playing brighton or doncaster, get over it you are sh@t!|`|bNykcEVXaa	I think it would only improve it... there are enough scots in england so support would not be as much as a problem as it might have been.. ?    dR bad|`|m2zXOREJaa	As long as the rest of Scottish football had the same opportunity of going into the Championship ,1st div, 2nd div ,3rd div ,4th div, 5th div   I would also like to see the Welsh league involved.    With that they wont accept it.|`|pq30NyW1aa	You know they are all too far up their own backside down there to see anything Scottish as a positive. Remember how they laughed at Larsson until he popped up against Arsenal for Barca a few years back. A wee bit of Henrik magic and the arsenal were beaten.|`|JsxuCDSJaa	it just means an extra 12 points a season against them scottish mugs|`|LoFCv31waa	Can't ever see the EPL joining Rangers and Celtic.

I'm the best in eastern section of Illinois and one of my legs is shorter than the other..|`|c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Yes you can be. Your body adapts to how you are made so I think there should be no problems with you running.      I read one of the running magazines (running fitness) last month and there was an article about runners with problems - and a double above the knee amputee runs marathons in about 3:20 - now if he can be a good runner like that I am sure that 1 short foot won't stop you|`|eqIZTripaa	You may need to get a steering device to help you straighten out.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Lots of people have different length legs. It can be corrected with lifts or orthodics.  If you run with one leg longer than the other you are likely to have ankle, knee, hip, and back pains.
tVEm2eJXaa	Give the Eagles a year or two until they will win the Super Bowl, that's only if they sign T.J. Houshmanzadeh. Just look what T.O. did to help out Donavan McNabb reach the Super Bowl in 2004. Even though T.J. isn't as good as T.O. at least he won't mess up a whole team and have a problem with his own QB.|`|GYJqa3ubaa	the best for brett favre fans  http://astore.amazon.com/brett.favre.new...|`|GtR8WaI5aa	They will win the superbowl for sure.  Donovan had bearly no WR's last season, so with an amazing playmaker, they will definelty go far.  But who knows, something might happen and both might get hurt.  We will just wait and see.|`|Fs7rCHO9aa	They won't win any super bowls for quite some time. They could get Adrian Peterson from the Vikings, TJ from Cincinnati, and Randy Moss from New England and they still wouldn't win the super bowl.|`|0TAld46gaa	If Mcnabb and Westbrook stay healthy they will make a strong case.  You never know in the NFL things happen|`|AA11097612	I think that football is the ultimate "TEAM" sport and the addition of one player is not going to make that much of a significant difference.  Look at the Steelers and the Pats.  Neither team, going position by position, has the "best" player at that position.  They have some extremely good players at some positions like Brady and Harrison, but there not at every position.      If the Eagles want to go and win the Super Bowl they will have to develop a better tearm.  The addition of Houshmanzadeh would be a major step towards that end.      BTW, I would love to see TJ leave the AFC North.  It would make the Bengels even easier for the Steelers to beat up on.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	I have yet to see anything where he was signing with anyone, this is news to me but i tell you thats a good fit|`|85ab2af63fb56f9dc602cf0b2db9849eaa	He brings the curse of the Terrible Towel with him. The Bengals now have a better chance than the Eagles since the curse will be lifted from them when he leaves the team.

Maybe we can even see Kennedy come out and talk smack to him :)     I could see him coming out as Shane and doing the dance...but because Shawn was him and did him so well...maybe they will pass on him being Shane all-together.

Ultimate Warrior.. that would be hilarious!!  Austin.. been there, done that. So I would think The Rock.      Since Rocky doesnt care to join any WWE functions, except to only when inducting a family member, this would at least make it seem like he did at least care to show up for an important WWE event!!!  Well, not really....

A Rede Globo nem sempre  politicamente correta quando transmite jogos de times cariocas, mas n?o se esque?a que s?o 4 equipes do Rio e elas jogam com equipes de outros estados e a Globo transmite para os estados de origem jogos que agradam as torcidas predominantes. Se voc quiser ver jogos apenas de sua equipe entre em contato com a Band e exija que eles gastem uma fortuna para ter exclusividade do Brasileir?o e ai sim voc vai ver jogos apenas do Palmeiras e do Corintians, ou ent?o assina a uma Tv por assinatura que seria melhor.

Mas deram a volta por cima fazendo o dever de casa, que consiste em dispor de uma equipe com nvel tcnico competitivo e plantel a altura de substituir os titulares no decorrer da competi??o devido as contus?es e cart?es recebidos pelos jogadores.  Um time sem estrutura e plantel adequado fatalmente disputar uma competi??o para livrar -se do rebaixamento.  O que ocorreu com o Corinthians em 2007.  Agora o caminho  seguir o exemplo dessas equipes  e lutar para retornar a primeira divis?o, ou passar vrios anos disputando a segundona.

You could also train with a parachute. You could buy them online.    Last but not least, film your running if you can. Put it somewhere that people can review it.

Stoke vs. Chelsea:  With the elation of a magnificent point gained at Anfield still coursing through the veins, Stoke will be good for about 45 minutes as long as they dont think about attacking however theyre at home and the faithful will want to see some courage  then itll be over!    I was disappointed with the Blues against United and felt that they didnt really believe in themselves  that wont happen at the Britannia. Expect normal services to be resumed with the return of Didier Drogba  Scolari will demand it.    Stoke 0  3 Chelsea    Everton vs. Liverpool:  With any derby match notoriously hard to pick, Id love to pull a John McCain and not show up, but in all honesty how can you avoid the Merseyside derby!    Everton of last season wouldve made this a far simpler match to analyze as they were solid, compact, a little boring but tough to beat  this season bah! Its like theyve developed schizophrenia, you just never know who will show up.     Rafa Benitez has probably spent the week removing pieces of egg from his goatee after dropping points to Stoke at Anfield  not the form of potential champions. All will be forgiven though if three points make there way back across Stanley Park. The big guns are fit and Robbie Keane is so overdue, it has to be his day.    Everton 1 -2 Liverpool

iOICjcZcaa	I heard they were going to make him lose a few matches because he went off on a drug tester during their monthly drug test. He said "So you go to college to do THIS?" to the guy, and he got offended and told Vince.    But yeah, I'm sick of Triple H. He feels the need to bury everyone for some reason. Is it possible for him to put over anyone?|`|JsxuCDSJaa	3 times remember the scramble match|`|u2H68wiaaa	How is he getting buried????  MVP almost won both matches.  Triple H made him look strong as hell.  Last night, MVP had Triple H down and set up for his finisher and he hestitated, which allowed Triple H time to avoid it and hit the pedigree.  MVP was to the point where one more move would have put Triple H away and missed.  That's not getting buried.    No, MVP is not getting punished.  He's getting pushed.  He's had two very competitive matches with the WWE Champion in a row, and he's not even the  1 contender.  He's moved up into the upper midcard, and very soon, he'll be a full time main eventer.|`|w9YRazevaa	i have no idea if the wwe has any problem with mvp but what i do know is that triple h isn't that open to let new talents outshine him.. & btw, that's the exact reason of triple h & undertaker's recent fall out..|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Let's take Triple H out of the equation.  MVP, as well, for now.    We have a fairly new, mid-card wrestler.  Let's call him Sting.  Sting is an exciting performer, who ain't too shabby on the mic.  The fans are getting behind this colorful character.  The promoters take notice and elevate him.  Sting begins wrestling upper mid-card and even main event wrestlers such as Terry Taylor and Eddie Gilbert, Michael Hayes and Larry Zbyszko.  He does well in those matches and the fans get behind him even more.    Sting gets several matches with the World Champ Ric Flair and fails to win the Title.  Despite failing to defeat the World Champ the fans are more behind Sting than ever.  Sting gets elevated to upper-card and main event level, wrestling with Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, the Four Horsemen, and The Road Warriors.    He finally wins a title after about two years (the NWA TV title) but that reign is unspectacular until he faces The Great Muta.  Muta eventually emerges from the feud as the TV Champ and Sting moves even higher in the card.  Sting goes on to win the Iron Man Tournament main event at Starrcade (WCW's Wrestlemania), defeating the World Champ Flair, making Sting number one contender for Flair's title.    Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Title a year and a half after winning the TV Title.  He lost many times to Flair before finally beating him.  At no time was Sting ever considered "buried" by Flair.  Flair made Sting look awesome in the ring, often escaping by the skin of his teeth.    Substitute Triple H for Ric Flair, and MVP for Sting (and Matt Hardy for The Great Muta); the scenarios are quite similar, except that MVP has never been as over as Sting, nor as popular.    To have a relative newcomer (who isn't 6'6 and 300 pounds of muscle; or a technical wizard) just suddenly start beating the top guys in the company (especially the World Champ) is unrealistic and not believable.    To have one of the top guys repeatedly losing to a mid-card wrestler is equally unrealistic.  To properly build that mid-card wrestler as a viable main eventer, he has to lose to the top guys, but each time give a better and better account of himself until the top guys are having a very difficult time winning.    Triple H is bringing MVP up to the main event properly.  If Triple H just kept squashing MVP, or worse, kept laying down for him, then we would have a legitimate beef with him.  But that is not the case.  Triple H is making MVP look strong and capable in the ring.  They are giving us good matches and making us believe that on any given night MVP just might beat Triple H.  The fans, whether or not they personally like MVP, are starting to get behind his efforts, rooting for the underdog.  It may not take as long for MVP as it did for Sting to beat Flair, but one night he will defeat Triple H, possibly even for a World Title.  THEN, we will all shout "hooray!  MVP finally did it!  He finally put it all together and beat one of the best in the business".  Believe me, we will have more respect for MVP because of his perseverance and efforts to improve his performances than if he just walked in and trounced Triple H that first match.    Too many people are confused by the "smarks" and spoiler sites whining about Triple H's "backstage power".  Triple H, more than any other wrestler in the WWE, wants the WWE to succeed and thrive.  It won't if Triple H, the Undertaker, Kane, John Cena, Batista, Edge, and Randy Orton just walk to the ring and kill every opponent.  Every one of them, including Triple H, climbed the ladder the same way MVP is doing now.    MVP is getting elevated to the main events, competing against the World Champ.  I'd hardly call that punishment.  Don't confuse "losing" for "burying".  For a great example of "burying" read up on what WCW under the management of Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo did to Ric Flair.    Punishment would be losing to Funaki, Nunzio, and Deuce week after week, and never getting any chance to wrestle a top guy like Triple H.|`|JN2sTf1uaa	no!!!!|`|9r1VnQIXaa	he is getting buried cos wwe dont think he's progressing fast enough.I think he is.10 pts pls|`|qNHMcRL4aa	i dont like mvp but i hate triple h now so yes.  triple h wouldnt let a magazine print a picture of his smackdown vs raw character in a vulnerable position. its pathetic  (ive written it loads before but i think everyone should know)

zqvGwd8Maa	1. lionel messi  2.kaka  3.c.ronaldo  4.gerrard  5.ballack  6.lampard|`|e48c7e18cf055bffcb58160bbcb4ec2caa	1. Andrei Arshavin:   Arshavin is often over-looked. He did gain some recognition during Euro 2008, but some people are still not aware of how brilliant a player he is. Arshavin has pace, a great-work rate, determination, accuracy, skill, and an awesome imagination. He is a player who, when he isn't scoring goals (which, more often than not, are quite special), he is setting them up, building goal-scoring opportunities from nothing.     2. Steven Gerrard  Steven Gerrard is one of the greatest footballers ever. Period. This is a man who has worked for everything he has, who has fulfilled his childhood dreams. He can defend, attack, everything. He has speed, he has accuracy, he's not selfish, he is a leader. He is a top-notch player.     3. Dirk Kuyt  Kuyt is really under-rated. He doesn't always receive the attention or the respect that he deserves, but he never complains about it. Kuyt moved to the Premiership as a top scorer in the Dutch League. He may not score as often as he used to, but he certainly plays an important role. Dirk Kuyt will play any position, any time, no complaint. Top man.    4. Gianluigi Buffon  Gigi is one of the world's greatest keepers. He is an essential member of Juventus, and also of the Italy National team. Anyone who watched him play in Euro 2008, or in the World Cup a few years ago, knows how fantastic he is.     5. Joe Cole  Joe Cole is incredibly talented. The speed he possesses is incredible. He is very creative, makes   beautiful, dead-on-accurate crosses. I see his career lasting  a long time, with many successes.     6. Carlos Tevez  Tevez sometimes is cast under Ronaldo's shadow, over-looked. This man has an incredible work-rate. He never stops trying. Determination flows through his veins. Tevez has great speed, awesome power. I really enjoy watching this footballer. |`|x7G5lrMBaa	1. Heinze  2. Campbell  3. Gallas  4. Puyol  5. Vidic  6.

(and this goes to 99% of people that ask best player questions). this is my list, based on natural talent, leadership qualities, unselfishness, etc. and by the way these ratings are for this very second. (i might not be able to contain every category to one:)    Best striker: ibrahimovic  Best keeper: buffon, casillas  Best centerback: Nesta  Best winger: messi  Best centermid: gerrard  Best fullback:ramos (didnt wana put that because i dont believe that he is good enough to be called the best at his position, but athe second most good fullbacks are aging or coming through the ranks).  i didnt mention kaka cuz he doesnt really fit into any of these, but he deserves to be on here. as far as raw talent, cr7 deserves a spot, but i am an unbiased opinion, that, as you can see, admires many clubs but he is a little bit too selfish and his dives can really ruin the good naturedness of the beautiful game, not the lets try and make the ref make a bad call and then celebrate while the rest of the world knows the game's result was swayed by your stupid dives game. cr7 just doesn;t fit my personal taste.    PS:      Yes, mr. americans are dumb, cr7 is the six best players in the world. why do people hate american soccer so much just because we call it soccer?? why cant we all just love the beautiful game?? i cant wait till america passes up the rest of the world at soccer and we smash the arrogant british!!!!|`|479df4259dcb26528acd93edf2bfb91baa	Good to see the people of the world are like sheep and only vote for those the media feeds to them.

These wrestlers in my opinion are the best wrestlers of all time.    -Quote the Raven...Nevermore|`|agIiai2paa	I would go with Sting.    I consider Sting to be the legend of legends.  Sting has been around for a very long time. He has tremendous respect from everyone.  He's never really done anything that was controverial.    He was a big star in the NWA, WCW and TNA  (he wasn't in WWE by choice).      He's held championships in every wrestling promotion that he's been in of UWF, NWA, WCW, and TNA.   8 time World Champion (5 WCW; 2 TNA;1 NWA),   4 time Tag Team Champ(3 WCW; 1 TNA),   (if he was in WWE he probably would have held every single notable title of midcards, tag teams and heavyweights).    He has helped build the popularity of WCW and TNA. Sting was one of the first well known wrestlers to sign with TNA in 2003.|`|JsxuCDSJaa	WHAT?|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Bret "The Hitman" Hart, made all the mid-card wreslters look good even tho they were "not" and helped give them a push.

I have yet to see someone's face get smashed in as bad is it did when you got hit with the Van Terminator.     He the king of ECW, but it's just too bad the WWE never really pushed him the way he needed to be pushed. It was amazing the way he ruled ECW. I am sure there were others, but the only guy I can actually think of that beat him is Rhyno. I am sure Sabu beat him somewhere in their long series of matches, but I don't remember seeing it.

Carolyn and some others had enough of that, but I don't take these stuff seriously, we also have a few idiots giving our fans a bad name but you have to say the majority of LFC fans do more talking about others than their own team.    Cool as always Dan vv.
569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Oh dear is that the only option we have?  I say start Babel in matches.  The guy is so talented and I know he can score if he's given chances.|`|p8lB73rdaa	We'd want to be extremely desperate for that to happen .  He's a WWF wrestler not a footballer .|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Oh dear, this is desperation at it's very best|`|40kCOPicaa	who needs Voronin, he's a flop too, Torres is good enough|`|67qiqedgaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!! give ngo a chance|`|AA12370193	Voronin? You can't recall him he is completing his loan spell and the window closed already.    oh is that so... well liverpool may need to do that if necessary then. Unless N'Gog magically starts bringing something to the plate in case Torres is unavailable.|`|40cUhBfnaa	Voronin will not come back|`|zJCWIWE0aa	Im a liverpool fans and i love Voronin, Gerrard and Torres should move to Arsenal there not good at our club we should sell them to Mr wenger|`|EQrbowGjaa	We meet again lool  Our options  we play a 4-2-3-1   and hope torres dont get injured  If he does we play kuyt up front   then we can play babel / benayoun / reira / el zhar or pennant on the wings  If kuyts injurered then ngog   but I hate veronin i dont want him back!
D7Dubtt9aa	All the above they are all responsible in one way or another for whats happening to the club|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Benitez.  Because he didn't briing in a replacement.  Asshole.|`|AEK3Gaa6aa	One man can play for Spurs and Liverpool and Spurs again and cost 32 million while doing it :P    As for the FQ:  1, 2, 3 and 4    Get rid of em all.|`|JCRdicqXaa	If Torres gets injured for the rest of the season then there is NO -one to score any goals.    Is it possible to get relegated at this late stage ?    FQ.  All.|`|no3tD0OSaa	I Think they should all stay man, they are contributing to Liverpool's downfall, and that's fine by me|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	All of the above.....MUST STAY!!
AEK3Gaa6aa	Yes why not, they are already the laughing stock of the Premier League after 'renting' Blobbie Keane for 8 million for 4 months.    They should now pay 125,250,750,000,000 for Crouch and sit him on the bench for 3 months before selling him back to Portsmouth for 50 quid and a doner kebab every saturday night for 3 weeks.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	YES!|`|p8lB73rdaa	Should never have been sold !  He was the perfect foil for Torres , holding up the ball , laying it off for him , but as is typical with Benitez he wasn't given the chance .  As soon as Torres arrived Crouch was dropped .   On the last day of the season last season he wasn't even in the squad so never got a chance to say goodbye to the fans , another case of benitez treating a player like shite !|`|cOPCNP7Laa	LMAO enough with these player come backs!!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I don't understand why he was sold, he couldn't stop scoring for them, where is the logic in that?|`|D7Dubtt9aa	He shouldn't have gone in the first place|`|uXXbegw5aa	I was actually thinking that to myself earlier.    I don't know why he was sold in the 1st place.    I think they should have signed him back :)|`|RSJbqioUaa	I don't understand why they sold him. There's a Spain v England international coming up....Torres' hamstring? What's Rafa gonna do if he's injured again? SCREWED.    FQ: YES!|`|OKgbeWe3aa	Yes he should have been signed back.  But meh, its too late now so who cares?|`|JCRdicqXaa	And bring him back to endure more misery ?  No.
no3tD0OSaa	After the way Roman treated him?    If had any sense it would be better bringing the gods back such as Guillit and Vialli.. those were the days!|`|p8lB73rdaa	Did I not already tell you that Jose will be Liverpool manager next season ?    @ Earshot , As a real Liverpool fan I have been calling for Rafa's head for the last two seasons.  At no time this season did I ever state that we were in with a chance of winning the League .  I know for a fact that the man is not capable of winning the league .  There may be some Fairweather Liverpool fans on here but I'm not one of them !      BTW , Mourinho to Liverpool is not as far fetched as you may think . He's already been approached and is not happy in Italy.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Tbh I think he may come back. But in like 3-4 years.|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Did I not already tell you that Jose doesn't want to go to a funny club like Liverpool ?   LMAO the Liverpool fans really crack me up, calling for Rafas head after Wigan, beat Chelski(twice) and Man U but still want him to go. Hah    I don't think Jose will be returning to the EPL anytime soon, in another 5 years........maybe ? He has hinted about returning to management in the Premier League one day and I don't think he'll ever be back to Chelsea, sorry.    @ Del - We've never won the CL, but I believe Wenger is the manager to finally get us that trophy.You've had a great start to the season and only are 2 from the top, why is everyone losing it now, hes won you a CL, FA cup and more. I say, have faith in your team, I still prefer Liverpool winning the league than Man U or Chelski, said it all along.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|mK06dus9aa	It will happen. Trust me.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I don't think he'll ever return to the bridge, no, sorry|`|huto12P3aa	Not a chance|`|N7fNwIQSaa	No because he wouldnt want to go back to a club like that|`|rxVmmMa4aa	i don't think so   inter milan is doing a quite good job and chelsea is descending  and also without enough investments, mourinhio simply cannot get the players he wants  so it is hard|`|x7G5lrMBaa	although i am not a chelsea fan, i have to say i would love it if he can go back to Chelsea... he makes the premiership much more colourful...    and afterall, he was the one who really setup this squad... and i believe the players will still respect him...|`|zvuvU2d5aa	No chance, he will return to the Premier League but to replace SAF or go to Liverpool.  He was sacked at Chelsea after taking a team that 10 years ago was a middle of the table team to 2 league titles and making them a big club.  He resents Chelsea now and would never return.|`|krc0jb6Oaa	Look, Mourinho is 46. Ranieri is 57 and Eriksson is 60.    The point I'm making is that Mourinho has many years left in his managerial career. He has not ruled out a return to Chelsea.    Will it happen? I'm not sure. But if it does it certaintly won't be in the next 5 years. Abramovich and him are still good friends, Mourinho is still young in terms of his managerial career and he has not ruled it out.    It's possible.|`|DZ24AAkiaa	sorry to say this    but i don't think he will be back|`|4v278ckwaa	I dont think so, Inter are offering him everything chelsea didnt offer him; appreciation,respect,perfomance,sportsma... and most important Zlatan Ibrahimovic
Agl9ZpnEaa	Obviously Harrison..He was the Defensive Player of the Year, and played a huge part in all the wins and specifically the Superbowl.  You can't put a price tag on someone who gets you that 6th ring!!|`|iFYDmPizaa	James harrison for sure.  He was the real Super bowl MVP and was the defensive MVP i dont think there couldve been a better bargain|`|a6EndAPiaa	Chris Horton SS Redskins $ 331,516    7th round pick who was in the running for defensive rookie of the year.  He made a big impact and came out of no where and without his signing bonus he made $10,000 over the league minimum salary.  That is a bargain by any definition.|`|F934e4HQaa	1)STEVE BREASTON  2)BRANDON MARSHALL  3)JOE FLACCO  JAMES HARRISON IS A CHEATER AND IS WORTH NOTHING|`|0BgzkLdUaa	James Harrison DID win the SB for the Steelers. Aside from the refs...|`|4kdlE54Paa	Very hard to say.  I think they all fall in the same catagory as best bargain.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	marshall , the guy is gonna make a career long impact on the league|`|JKQKG3tQaa	This year its games harrison since he contributed greatly to the stealers superbowl win|`|0ylaEVtraa	Joe Flacco
gYFA9TKSaa	rodgers  hes more of a playmaker and has a better arm|`|5xIroQjMaa	Aaron Rogers all the way.|`|Agl9ZpnEaa	That's not even a question...Aaron Rodgers.|`|S81fac8haa	Aaron Rodgers|`|4kdlE54Paa	Both are good, but I would go with Aaron Rodgers.  He has promise and did better than expected as a QB in his first year as a starter.  He definitely got too much criticism for the poor 2008 record when it wasn't his fault.  The defense couldn't stop the run and the run was not strong like it was previously in 2007.    Thumbs up to those who agree.
hWaynBpMaa	This season it will be between five clubs. I think Stoke and Hull will stay up. Hull are battlers and Stoke are hard to beat at home.  Relegation teams will be:    WBA   Boro  Pompey  Spurs  Blackburn    and Danial dont be such a D""K|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Oh I would live Man City to be part of that group...|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	WBA,boro and stoke|`|AA12302228	mackems to back wher they belong,boro to take the smog with them,hull cause their citys shite.|`|mK06dus9aa	At this time of the season a look at recent form can be more telling than table position.    I think Boro are a nailed on certainty for the drop.    Portsmouth are doing very very badly and Adams look beleaguered and out of his depth. Maybe the signing of Angelos Basinas may have some effect because the guy knows how to role his sleeves up and scrap. But I still pick them for second bottom.     Hull are now in free fall and could get sucked in, but Newcastle are 4 points below them and have missed the chance of making a season saving manager change. Stoke will have to scrap for every point but I think they have the right attitude. So finally I take Newcastle to be the shock final victim.    So - Boro, Pompey and Toon to go down.|`|mRF1xv7iaa	west brom, middlesborough and stoke city    :)|`|3zbGNp4maa	Stoke, WBA, Hull|`|UeWhmTIRaa	i think boro will go down|`|STLnjU7Raa	TOTENHAM NEWCASTLE AND MAN CITY FOR THE DROP|`|sfHLcFaAaa	middles borough  west brom   balckburn|`|IBqH9x35aa	any of 12 at the moment unusual at this time of year but more interesting than the top half|`|61KNbfIuaa	Relegated:  west brom    middlesborough - if they don't get rid of Southgate    portsmouth - adams=sh1t    Promoted:  Wolves    Reading    Sheffield Utd - up the blades|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	Boro, Portsmouth and erm WBA.|`|EQrbowGjaa	STOKE  BOLTON  SUNDERLAND
QAwwmDuDaa	I thought the Gers had a good team anyway and thank hell they kept Boydy.|`|9MtS42oWaa	Yes getting Flood in and getting Maloney and Crossas back after long term injuries was like signing 3 new players.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	United buy new young star zoran tosic,adam ljajic,and richie de laet  good signing|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Couldn't of been better.|`|CpfFZ9exaa	Well yeah but no...I like Charlie  Adam (as a player lol) and appear to be one of a few who do lol.....    Hurry Home Charlie x    same here mags...tho Pedro was never off ayway|`|mn7cIHCxaa	man.utd did not need  any new players but tosic  looks like a good addition|`|gPsFFQbRaa	yes certenly happy with it.|`|MPqO1Qayaa	nope.  letting Mark Roberts go and replace him with a youngster from Hamilton who cant even score in the F*****G reserves......McCall must have been on the bevvy on that one.|`|cTTmHn9paa	not exactly. Celtic signed 8 players so 7 of them will be for the future and i assume Flood will get a game this season|`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	in a word...naw. not signing a left back is just criminal at worst, and negligent at best. i suppose we hung on to our best players, like yourselves, but its no consolation for having to watch naylor for the rest of the season|`|AA12055870	Not really, considering that fiscally, everything is meant to be rosy, why didn't we invest some of the monies we will be receiving from the Champs League escapade and strengthen the back line which is in desperate need of such action.    Willo Flood fair enough, but where will he play at present? Midfield is not our concern.    Overall no, we seemed to be suffering transfer window ennui.    Still there is enough talent in the squad to retain the title.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes i am, getting rid of Sheridan for any length of time can only be good news
7nDpz7vyaa	Old Al paid Manning off to take care of Cutler.  It's all part of the 5 year plan.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Imagine if Rivers did it lol|`|ubGNtkHQaa	It was suppose to be a joke but he didn't realize it was a blood-sugar monitor...|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Well he didn't know that the blood sugar monitor was in there. I hope you don't hate on Peyton because of this. It looks like they're having fun!|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Luca Brasi & Jay Cutler's monitor sleeps with the fishes|`|KTp27Fokaa	LOL that's funny. I would have done the same thing if I saw Cutler standing over the pool. But then I would have ran. Would have ran fast.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	we can all only hope. :)|`|XuGFt3boaa	No.  I think Manning was playing a joke on Cutler.|`|VghVdPfsaa	No, it was just a joke that intended to be harmless. Although, I can't believe that they thought the diabetes monitor looked like a cell phone though...    At least Cuter is unharmed.|`|201gZ8w0aa	hahahhaa thats funny|`|TjttzpPKaa	Pretty funny stuff. Boys will be boys... Ironpump. Rivers can't do it, seeing as that he never made the Pro Bowl. (Sorry, just couldn't resist saying that). Cutler should have told them it was a special monitor and charged them 3 times the amount to replace it.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	haha a pro bowl baptism!  good ol' kris dealman      yeah thats peyton manning fer ya|`|dDhTMacAaa	very funny!    i'd rather focus on the funny aspect|`|32Ftg0Ceaa	so am i|`|s9Pwnb87aa	He's afe unless Manning asks him to visit the Kilauea Volcano and then he should be very suspicious.|`|kfySwy8baa	it kind of funny just glad no one got hurt
E3wAsSjUaa	If he were to be traded the other team would have to give NE two 1st round draft picks. That's a huge risk for a QB that only started 15 games.    The Pats will likely keep him as an insurance policy should anything happen to Brady. At least Cassel had a seasons worth of experience and a great deal of knowledge about the NE offense. Right now, he's to valuable to give up.|`|ITq5FNXuaa	i know he will be traded but minnesota vikings are another possible suitor|`|RTaimrg7aa	I don't think Cassel will flourish with any other offensive scheme.  Det could move that way, but none of the prospects offered will be a good fit.|`|8sqOVMvNaa	you forgot about St. Louis and Oakland  tehy need aQB bad  i hate NE    but he might stay around never know about a kneee injury could mess up real easily|`|NoxclPX4aa	The st. louis rams could really use a talented qb such as himself. Who knows, i might start rooting 4 the rams again if that happened.|`|ZWpAhfeTaa	Yes cassel has just recieved the frachise tag 1year 14.75 million dollars. He will definitely go to kansas city or detroit if tom brady looks like he'll be ready for the season opener. If there not for brady he will stay. If brady is not ready he will stay. So really i think its a toss up. But good question man cause i think he will be traded to. they won't keep two good quaterbacks on the team(brady)(cassel).|`|ZcQu4t2Baa	yes he got a franchise tag, that sucks the bears were going to get him he cost now like millions of bucks|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	They'll probably want to make sure Brady's healthy first, so I don't think he'll be traded until draft day. KC likes Thigpen and Detroit has bigger problems, but San Francisco, Minnesota, Chicago or Carolina could be a fit.
tz7JEqstaa	The man is a joke. Selfish is the correct choice of words.|`|AA11088802	.........|`|JyYAArPNaa	may be|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	How far do you guys go?|`|gfxXikenaa	no i think you wanted to say DONY not dhoni .lol because  Don Bradman was known to be a very selfish cricketer .  After scoring a world record of 334 runs in the Test match at Leeds, Bradman was given a cheque for ?1000 by an admiring expatriate Australian businessman. Tebbutt wrote that Bradman had not even offered to buy his teammates a round of drinks, let alone share the money.    So Dony bradman was selfish . good question~|`|HSXxRjysaa	hi again...  you know,raina wasnt in his form from the 1st match..so if India loses another wicket,it might pressure incoming players like Dhoni,Yousuf..and today too he didnt get too many runs..|`|bettx8AYaa	raina is good plyer but dhoni is more good plyer and does good bating and kepers .  panting not plying for astralian telling tired like that but coming to ipl beging for mony.  so panting is selfsh.|`|FNs7MZF4aa	So What's your question again?

CB7QJO4uaa	Hey,    Pretty much every single Bundesliga game is live at http://www.livefootballstreams.co.uk . Even the Bundesliga 2 matches are there. Great quality streams always dude.|`|9DR92idZaa	you can watch the spain la liga and bundesliga on Goltv channel..  most of the time i watched the games on justin.tv website..u can type in the two team that playing on the search box, then u'll see some result.
geih5vR8aa	They don't need to focus on the DB situation, until they find some a better pass rush, with a beefed up D-line.    The rest of what you said, I agree with.  They niners FAILED the last time everyone kept crying about how we needed another QB, with Alex Smith. We're never gonna get another Joe Montana or Steve Young, so stop trying to compare every passer to those guys.      Shaun Hill can win games. He's not the best guy for the long term future, but you're right, an O-line would be the first thing that they needed... and not at just one or two positions. They need help all around.     I also think that since Vernon Davis is a bust at Tight End, yet supposedly has elite blocking skills at the position, that he should be used at fullback at times. That utilizes his blocking skills for the QB, and for Gore, cuz lets face it, Gore doesn't have much left. He broke down last season because the O-Line is so terrible.      At Fullback, the Niners can option him around and move him up to play tightend for a two TE set with Delanie Walker. It gets Walker on the field more (confuses the hell outta the Defense). It keeps Vernon on the field more... and instead of trying to throw the ball to Davis with a deep pattern, where he's going to get confused, you can simply hand the ball off to him.. He's a playmaker who can't make plays, cuz he can't run routes in the NFL. You can also dump the ball off to him and let him mow over players.    They need another Big play receiver. Josh Morgan looks like he has some skill, but at 6'0", has limitations in the red zone... Did you see the Playoffs and how Fitzgerald uses his size to his advantage? throw the ball up in the corner of the end zone and he gets it.     Then in a year or two, when you have worked on that O-Line and the receivers have matured a bit, then you can get a QB. One who is going to have protection. One who is going to have time to throw, cuz when you come out of college, you're not that fast at thinking. You don't know the game speed, and you don't know the plays as well as a veteran... so how do you expect him to make a decision in even less time, when you have a HORRIBLE O-Line?    Ok, so lets recap:    Round 1 - O-Line, trade up if you have to, cuz they are a few guys who will go early. If not, get a D-Linemen. It never makes sense to get the 3rd or 4th best O-lineman in the draft, who will be mediocre, when you could have used the 10th pick to draft a stud Defensive End.  Round 2 - If you got the O-Linemen, get a D-Linemen, or vise-versa.  Round 3 - Look at those bigger receivers from smaller schools, who didn't get looked at, cuz they were told they didn't possess NFL speed.  Round 4 - Another O-Line guy  - you can't have enough of them, especially when you have NONE to begin with. Niners need a Tackle, and a Guard.  Round 5 - QB if there is anyone interesting, maybe another Receiver, or Corner back in this round. Could find a sleeper.  Round 6 - Safety  Round 7 - Who cares.      I think Singletary may be new at the head coaching position, but he wants a shut up and hit someone attitude (like my alma mater FRESNO STATE!!!)  Singletary likes to run the ball, and to do so effectively, needs a good O-Line. Lets hope he has the balls to do what's best for the team, and not do what the fans and critics are telling him to do... wait, we all know he has the balls to do what he thinks is best, even if it means pulling your pants down around your ankles during halftime.... lol.    Same for Jed York. I think he's a smart kid who is passionate about the game, unlike his parents, so let's hope he doesn't make a rookie ownership move and try and draft his franchise QB first.  There will be better QB's coming out next year. A lot of them went back for their senior season, probably cuz they don't want to get drafted to the Lions, and end up as the next Alex Smith.    Also, Jesus still loves you... REALLY!!!! You think the niners need to draft a better MLB? Patrick Willis is one of the best, and was drafted 2 years ago. Keep up with the game bro.  Their linebackers are the one part of the team that they don't need.    And dear God, Matt Cassell? He is a Shaun Hill on a Great team. AND he just got the franchise tag, so the niners would have to give up TWO 1st round draft picks.|`|okECVBkzaa	Another pass rusher or an o lineman is where id start. Those are the important areas. They really need a  1 WR as well, but that can come later. Hill is decent enough to get them to the playoffs once they fill the above needs.    My question is why Jimmy Raye? He's been around the NFL for a reason.|`|S81fac8haa	I say they need to go for O-line or D-line both would be nice.|`|iFYDmPizaa	They should get someone on Defense it doesnt matter where but they need help there.  Also i think they need to get a QB but Graham Harrels stock is falling and they might be able to grab him late|`|RTaimrg7aa	You have one of the best (untried) coaches in my opinion.  Man if he could only have coached the skins instead of Zorn. I get a man chubby thinking about it. There wouldn't be a Portis problem and Moss would have a warm butt from sitting on it after shining his shoes..... I digress.  Singletary, I think will stick with the stable of QB's he has.  Hill, and Smith have shown spark, and they are young enough to work into a good QB.|`|oiEgFFNEaa	Shaun Hill will never be a like a Joe Montana or Steve Young. At best he will be like  Jeff Garcia. Although he will never be a star he gets the job done. 7-3 is pretty darn good considering your best WR is an aging Isaac Bruce and a O-Line that is falling apart. the 49ers are hesitant to draft another QB as their first round draft pick, as i am sure you remember Alex Smith. In fact, the last few QB's the 49ers have drafted have been busts including Ken Dorsey. San Fran should either get a proven QB out of free agency or stick with Hill. A team with a "normal guy" as their QB are the Chicago Bears with Kyle Orton and they have had relative sucess. the niners need completley rebuild their O-Line and get a better D-end. They should also they about rebuilding their denfense around Patrick Willis. They have to build their offense more around gore and the running game rather than the passing game.|`|HiuNSScLaa	no draft sanchez sit him for a year behind hill then you got a franchise qb what if you dont get a franchise q this draft your not gonna stay up to get bradford tebow is not a franchise q and you wont suck enough to get mccoy either get sanchez then use your 2nd pick smartely either a reciever who you can throw it up to like tall or a o lineman d end or a db wich ever is more skilled then keep goin its not gonna be a 1 year fix like my fins or anything you got a runner so dont worry about that you got p willis who can carry the load on the linebackers for a bit i would pick up boldin so then u can use your 2nd pick on a o lineman then 3rd a db then 4th a d end|`|T0FTAeDoaa	No becuz i heard rumors that yall r gettn vick... MIKE VICK.  Becuz his old coach Dan Reeves is there|`|ubGNtkHQaa	There have been reports of them trying to get Matt Cassel..if they are going to get a qb in the draft their best bet would be Cassel since he's proven unlike Sanchez and Stafford|`|KTp27Fokaa	You build from the lines first. They need to go after an offensive or defensive lineman, because they are lacking in both areas. Shaun Hill is fine for now, but eventually, they will need to draft a QB.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Shaun Hill will never be a star, but he's a solid quarterback that rarely makes mistakes, and right now that's good for the 49ers. What they need is just what you said. Shore up their Offensive line, get a pass rusher, and maybe a marquee receiver (Cause you know Boldin is going to be available. I'd love to see him in SF). Then next year you can look to the future and draft a quarterback.|`|rM9WzIkHaa	i would say no  it seems like every other year they're looking at new QB's i think they need to get some better linebackers.  i would really like to see them pick up Luinaitas or the MLB from usc. i would love to try and get b dawkins but i think hes going to stay with the eagles then we could maybe get julius peppers that would be an excellent pick up, but i would hate to see the 9ers keep working on getting  a new QB when we should just work with him. and i choose the 9ers this year for the playoffs
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	absolutely couldnt agree more.  After the Ravens beat Dallas there were people in here saying Romo choked.  He drove down an threw 2 tds against that defense with less then 4 mins to go in the game, an the defense blew the game by giving up 2 80 yard runs back to back.  Romo didnt come in an play linebacker.  Another thing..........people dont want to acknowledge Trent Dilfer (for example) for winning a Super Bowl an say "oh he just had a good defense".  Ok, thats true, but Roethlisberger doesnt?  It just seems like whoever people like, thats who they crown as "good"  The QB gets way too much credit an way too much flack.|`|Agl9ZpnEaa	Yeah, it's never totally a QB's fault for losing a game, unless you are Jake Delhome and throw 25 int. in one game.  Besides that it IS a team effort.  A running game is ONLY good if the O line opens holes.  A passing game is highly influenced by receiver routes and protection.  Everybody feeds off of everybody to make it a collective team effort.|`|RTaimrg7aa	The QB is only the first one to catch the flack. There is so much that goes into it including the O-line, play calling, receivers drooping passes, and defense.  Since the QB touches the ball the most for the team he's just the main target.|`|6e2c3f79b5d1c7c11ce3cfa9d37906e4aa	O line wins games, and D lines can win games too|`|blye7Aqlaa	Many good comments here, so I won't repeat those.  One big reason is $$$.  The QB is generally the highest paid player on every team, so they get the bulk of credit/blame from media.  Even though it takes all 11 guys on both sides of the ball executing their responsibilities to make a successful team.    Talent alone doesn't guarantee wins.  Examples from this season...Dallas had a ton of talent, but imploded due to chemistry & leadership issues...Arizona had mediocore overall talent (some great individual players; Fitzgerald for example), but jelled at the end of the season and had everyone executing their assignments and buying into the team.  They made the Super Bowl after getting blown out in 5 games this season.|`|exOOXAkBaa	They get too much credit and too much blame, simple as that.  But they can lose games.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	Just different opinion I guess. Like you said, football is a team sport. Every team most execute to win a game.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Yes, but the football QB is the most important position in sports.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Totally agree:    -When the team wins a big game (Steelers) they credit the qb and not their fantastic D    When a team LOSES a big game they all blame the qb and no one else (maybe coach)    Double Standard|`|c17x6L4baa	Only one player besides the center touches the ball every time normally.  He is the one who throws the passes, hands it off, and calls the snap.  No one person is more responsible.  The coach calls the plays.  He can't do them.    The QB isn't everything.  Of all individuals, he has the largest percentage of responsibility of any of them.  It may not be fair to say he won or lost the game.  But, the biggest mountain gets the attention.|`|habVAikEaa	that's because the QB is known as the field genraal, the captain, the god of the offense. but it's also to balme rthe o line too for not protecting their QB, and yeah, u are right, the defense sometimes messe up real bad as well.  the coaches are to balme as well sometime for giving a bad play.  but the main reason is that QB is the center tension of a football team.|`|vFasAFBUaa	You, me and other people think like that, but tell that to the media, they are the ones who are obsessed with trashing QB's reps. with stats and stuff like that, thats just my opinion, the media also puts a lot pressure on them

d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Assuming it will be allowed, then Ferrari are the obvious choice. They are possibly the only team with the material and manpower resources to be able to do it straight away. McLaren would probably have to follow Ferrari, but it might cost them in the long run. Red Bull already provide 4 chassis every weekend, so I'm not sure they could put any more out. BMW, Toyota and Renault would have to expand their operations to do so...and that wouldn't be popular with any of their boards in the credit crisis. Williams and Force India would probably be incapable of providing a third car to the same standard as the other two, but may be more likely than other teams to enter a rent-a-driver in a third car as a way of bringing more sponsorship money into the team, or getting a marketing dream like Sato, Karthikeyan (or similar) into a car.    I covered all the extra stuff about drivers brought up by Dan in an answer last week: "And who would drive? That is where the conjecture becomes more interesting. I'm not sure that the big teams would put a novice into the third car - Renault running both Grosjean and Piquet seems a little extreme, and I doubt Ferrari would bother with Gene given his race record, or Badoer given his age AND race record. McLaren have a ready-made third race driver in De la Rosa, and three drivers per team would solve RB/TR's problem over Bourdais and Sato. Someone would almost certainly pick up Jenson Button as well...maybe a return to Renault, or the Renault-powered RB? It could also be a way back for Davidson and Winkelhock. It may even let rent-a-drivers from India and Japan get a seat without compromising the competitiveness of a team."|`|AA12066574	I can't see any of them actually doing it, not in the current economic climate where sponsors are hard to find. Ferrari, Toyota, and McLaren would probably be most likely to give it a try, but only if they got some help with their additional expenses from the FIA.|`|x277rQvqaa	Probably it would be an all or non situation. Otherwise, only the richer teams such as Ferrari and Mclaren would be able to even try|`|6ZMebqRaaa	I think that would be Ferrari, Mclaren or BMW. basically the teams that have the most resources.|`|iK9UCuS3aa	I can't see it happening this season as the teams have already registered for this season (With an exception of the former Honda team)  I'm not sure that it will be anywhere in the near future that we see three car teams in Formula One. Because not only would it put more of a strain on the financial side of F1 but I think that gives, in a way, more of an advantage to the teams that can afford and extra car. Those being Ferrari, Mclaren and maybe BMW.  At the moment the closest thing F1 has to a three car team is maybe Toro Rosso, the 'sister' team of Red Bull. From what I know most motor sport teams in the world only have 2 cars max per team.   That's only going on the V8's, WRC, Motogp and a few others.     But some teams do have a 3rd car that they help to support but don't fully own the car. Case i'm referring to is the situtation with Stone Brothers Racing (Australian V8 Supercars) who normally run 2 car team but Jason Bright's car is partly owned by SBR because of his own 2 car team failing due to demanding costs.|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	Well Bernie has mentioned that it would most likely be the top teams in the constructors championship, so Ferrari, McLaren, BMW and Renault would be the prime candidates.    Logistically, Renault are the only team here who could not really put a competitive 3rd car, so you could replace them with Toyota. The two Red Bull teams already put out 4 cars between them so extending that to possibly 6 would be too much! It would look like we'd all drank too much of their drink and started to hallucinate!!!     Williams and Force India could run cars as they have cheap/free engine deals which only means building extra chassis and a team for each car... It would also be a chance for race-worthy drivers such as Hulkenburg, Liuzzi, Sato et al to have a chance to race...    possible 3rd car drivers could be (most are test drivers!):    Ferrari - Badoer (He deserves it)  McLaren - Button/De La Rosa/Di Resta  BMW - Klien  Renault - Grosjean/Davidson  Toyota - Kobayashi  STR - Sato/Barrichello  Red Bull - Any number of their young drivers/Pantano/Davidson  Williams - Hulkenburg (definitely! he looks excellent!!)/Senna  Force India - Liuzzi (deserves a race drive)|`|c09e1f232acd578a9f591c5b83a68f43aa	Got to be Ferrari. As rosbif said, they are probably the only team who could turn up with a third car at short notice. If Bernie's plans are followed through to the letter then all the richer teams will HAVE to run third cars whether they want to or not.|`|MK129BdDaa	sorry to crush your dreams but it deffinately wont happen. the concorde agreement  stated if the number of cars droped below 18 then the top two teams would have to run a third car. however, this agreement expired several years ago and due to the economic crisis im pretty sure no one will do it volunteraly.

As we say in Arizona 'Whup 'em like a they were a sniffing badger'|`|WrDGhduxaa	You will run the race in your lane the entire distance. It is a sprint. You must get out fast and try to maintain your speed by relaxing.   Indoors is much harder than out doors because the curves are sharper and the straights are shorter.

4TgxrCX4aa	Santana>Zambrano  Pelfrey  Maine  Perez  Mets    Santana is the best pitcher in the game, but is he far and away better than Zambrano?  No, Santana has averaged 17 wins per season over the last 5 years, the Cubs have 2 starters who got 17 last year and would've had a 3rd if Zambrano stayed healthy.  While Santana is better, he's not far and away better and don't forget Zambrano can bust out a no-hitter now and then, too.    In the 2 spot though, Dempster makes up for any advantage Santana has and then some.  Last year was Pelfrey's first 30-start season and he only managed to go 2 games over .500.  Dempster had his first season as a starter after closing and went 17-6, that gives him a better record than any of the Mets starters last year including Santana.    I disagree with considering Harden behind Maine, sure Harden has a history of injuries, but if he only gets 20 starts he still has a good shot at getting 15 wins especially with the Cubs' offense.  Maine is no guarantee either, by the way.  He only has one full season and has one more than 10 games once.  Sure he has great stuff, but Harden has better.  Maine has good potential, but is unproven.  It's maybe a wash.    Ted Lilly is better at no. 4 hands down having not won less than 15 games in each of the last 3 years including a career-high 17 last year.  Perez has a career high of 15 and he did that once, 2 years ago.    For the number 5 spot I agree that Chicago has more options and so will probably put up a better starter whether it's Marshall, Samardzija, or at worst Heilman (I have no idea why we even wanted him).    That's 4 out of 5 spots where the Cubs are better, sure you have Santana, but who else?  No one else in that rotation has won more than 15 games in a season.  You bring up strikeouts, but the Cubs have led the Majors in strikeouts 8 years running now.|`|AA10021709	I think you are right.|`|cToRVz1Qaa	I some what agree, I would not say Maine is better than Harden.  Maine was injured last year, so Harden is not the only injury prone player.   Lilly and Perez may be even.  I would probably give the slight edge to the Cubs (I am a Mets fan too).    Aside from the Cubs and Mets though, I think the D-backs may have a as good if not better rotation.  Webb  Haren  D. Davis  Garland  M. Scherzer|`|4SKmjYrsaa	1st off, sorry but Jair Jurrjens, Tommy Hansen, or Kenshin Kawakami will blow him away whichever one ends up being the  4 guy in atlanta! Ollie is (good) but he's no stud! he dosent make or break a rotation, honestly the mets would have been smarter to sign Randy Wolf for less money and he'd put up the same  's with that offense hitting behind him. I think the Braves have the best rotation.   1)Lowe  2)Vazquez(will dominate in the weaker NL)  3)Kawakama  4)Jurrjens  5)Campillo/Glavine/Reyes/Parr/Morton    and dont forget te return of the braves real ace at mid-season  then it will be  Hudson  Lowe>Pelfrey  Kawakami>Maine  Jurrjens>Perez  Hansen>>>>>than anyone the mets will throw ou there|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Lets consider Harden to have the best stuff in the game. Putting Maine over him is just ignorant.    P.S. They highly overpaid for Perez|`|eP0KkYR3aa	D-backs are the best in the NL|`|iPWKzzQtaa	The Giants.    Santana...Zambrano...Linecum  Pelfre.......Dempser....Zito  Maine.......Harden......Matt Cain  Perez.......Lily............Randy Johnson  Redman....Heilman....Lowry.    I know, there are question marks over Zito and Johnson.    Neither Zambrano or Santana has won 20 yet...I didn't look it up, but I think so.    Also. Do your own research on Arizona, Houston and Milwaukee..I can't do it because I'm not sure whom the 4th and 5th starters would be...and Sheets is not signed yet.|`|IJ7vle8Vaa	real funny. no way.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I agree, but I'd still feel better if they can get Ben Sheets.    Their new park,by the way, Citifield, I think is going to be a pitchers park. The wind that comes off the bay (Flushing Bay) will blow straight into CF, and there won't be any "cheap" HRs there. You'll see allot of 2-1, 3-2 and 4-3 games.|`|7zfcYRqwaa	its the Giants  Santana=Lincecum  Maine  Pelfrey  Perez  Anybody    Johnathan Sanchez is probably the 2nd best pitcher on the Giants, but he is young so I go with Cain over him as the  2.  Mike Pelfry?  are you kidding me, if he is listed as you  2 then you have big problems.  John Maine needs to figure some things out.  Perez is the most schizophrenic pitcher in baseball.  The Mets rotation is average, but if Santana misses any time they are in a lot of trouble.|`|5xIroQjMaa	First off, saying Santana is on track to win 20 games this year, when he's only done that once in his career is a ridiculous statement. If you want to be accurate, then you should take the average of what he's done since 2003 (his first breakout year). So you're looking at a 16 game winner, and don't project past that. And look at that, 16 games is how many he won last year, so that looks pretty damn accurate to me.     So let's compare Santana to Brandon Webb. Webb has averaged more wins than Santana, and has been a stronger pitcher over the last 3 years, grabbing a Cy Young, and finishing 2nd twice, including a massive 22 wins last season (compared to Santana's 20)    So we have:   Webb > Santana  Haren > Pelfre  Garland > Maine  Davis   I'd say the number 5 starters are a wash right now for both teams.     But it's easy to see that Arizona has a far better starting rotation than the Mets. Now when you get to their hitters or their relievers it's a different story. But just starters? Not even close

H5EYUh69aa	I'm hoping that Jeff will win the smackdown elimination chamber match at   'No Way Out' and win the WWE championship.    Then I hope that somehow Edge is taken out of the title scene and given a feud with HHH but more lower level main event.    So that the WWE title match spot at Wrestlemania 25 is open for a Jeff/Matt WWE title match.    BUT realistically I think somehow Matt will screw Jeff out of the win in the chamber   (Probobly by somehow getting into the chamber when someone else eliminated is leaving)   and then he's take Jeff out and cost him the match, leading to a Matt/Jeff match at Wrestlemania.    OR my last thought is that Jeff wins the Chamber match at 'No Way Out' and wins the WWE title ... This leads to Wrestlemania which will have a triple threat match for the WWE title between Edge   (who obviously will have his rematch for the title) and Matt Hardy   (who Jeff wants revenge on) ... I could see this match being a TLC and it is definitly a potential show stealer, All 3 talents are awesome entertainers and performers and a triple threat AT wrestlemania FOR the WWE title IN a TLC match would be gold.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	EDGE CHAMP FOREVER|`|NXktxy8jaa	No, I think that they will push him back down to Mid-Carder status.

To fly there will be anywhere from $800 to $1400 USD for a round trip ticket. To stay in Thailand for 3 months you'll need a visa which are easy to get, but will run you about $100 USD. For a Muay Thai training camp it really depends on what kind you want to train at some can be cheap only costing you around $20 USD for a month, but others can go as high as $100 USD per month. Then your looking at meals, shopping, and other general expenses. You could go native for about $100 a month but most people don't understand what this entails. Its best to plane on a budget of about $700 to $1000 per month to live comfortably. Here is the camp I went to a few times when in Thailand.

If you are from the USA, you can go with out a visa for like up to 90 days, (double check on the USA embassy website)  The airline ticket for round trip would be anywhere between  $1200-$2200 depending on the airline, and how many stop-overs to get to your destination (Thailand)    And having about $900 for each month to live off of would be more then enough.    Depending on how old you are, you could get a part time job teaching english, that will pay for the trip itself.|`|ydoIYwGTaa	FedEx yourself there in a big box!

I think Boro are a nailed on certainty for the drop.    Portsmouth are doing very very badly and Adams look beleaguered and out of his depth. Maybe the signing of Angelos Basinas may have some effect because the guy knows how to role his sleeves up and scrap. But I still pick them for second bottom.     Hull are now in free fall and could get sucked in, but Newcastle are 4 points below them and have missed the chance of making a season saving manager change. Stoke will have to scrap for every point but I think they have the right attitude. So finally I take Newcastle to be the shock final victim.    So - Boro, Pompey and Toon to go down.|`|X6aDkjpHaa	tottenham the only difference with them and a triangle is that a triangle has 3pts|`|PBBkky3Faa	West Brom  Stoke City  Portsmouth|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	West Brom  Stoke  Spurs (hopefully)|`|Qfti287kaa	WBA, Middlesborough, and Stoke will be relegated this season|`|7IfyFXT3aa	Kasun, that joke only made sense four months ago.    I know too many annoying Spurs fans to NOT hope that they go down, but they've spent a whack of cash, and I have to believe that Harry keeps them up.    West Brom have had a couple of good results lately, but don't have the quality to compete.  You can play good football in the Championship, but you have to mix it up when you get to the PL (like Hull did), and WBA haven't done that.    I'd love to see Boro stay up, as I think Southgate has done a tremendous job with what he has, but it doesn't look likely.  As for the third, I think it's a dead heat between Newcastle, Pompey, and Stoke.  Only thing that may sway this is the Toon losing Owen for the rest of the season...|`|AA10561400	portsmouth  stoke  wba

One that is ready right out of college is rare. (nod to DeSean) there was no other reciever in NFL that did it this year.    You also don't need a top pick for a good, out of college running back.  Westbrook was.. I think a 5th or 6th.  Hightower had more to give his team as a later pick than the Raiders D-mack with that pick.  The Jets Washington, Sproles, Turner, etc are all later round picks.  Your right that Buckhalter does not have it.  If I were them I'd use 2 picks on RB that can spell Westbrook.|`|Hzfz41M4aa	I would say a top receiver, they can utilize a running/receiving back that can catch out of the backfield not a bruiser.

REALLY? pot will NOT make you swim faster or help you in any way.|`|08W7S3taaa	they can't take them away unless he does it before he competes. after he wins them he can to whatever he wants, even though he shouldn't.|`|AA11610448	I don't think they can take them away.  they probably tested him for drugs before or after the test and he was apparently clean at that point.  He earned them fair and square, he just has questionable judgment.|`|EUdHcGW1aa	I doubt it that he will lose his medals. He was tested along with the other athletes throughout the olympics. If he tested positive, he would have been stripped of his medals a long time ago.|`|OdDbR4Psaa	They can't do that. He was drug-free during his events so he won the medals fair and square.|`|HjFZUaQQaa	No they cant take them away...But ya know what doesn't make sense...Is that they didn't get any negative drug tests, I cant believe that this would be his first time smoking pot. So yeah...My friends dad is a swim coach and has met Michael and everything, he said he was a pretty down to earth guy...I wish that he hadn't. But oh well we all do stupid things.

fKAnnQeWaa	During the All-Star game Cici Sabathia, Prince Fielder, Carlos Zambrano and Adam Dunn get into an argument over the last chicken wing.    Zambrano starts it off by punching Sabathia since he tried to put his greasy hands on the wing. Fielder jumps in and bites a bit of Zambrano's arm off. Dunn then picks up Fielder and piledrives him into homeplate.Sabathia, Fielder and Zambrano triple team Dunn.    The fight ends up with Sabathia losing 3 teeth, Zambrano losing a chunk of his arm, Fielder ends up with his head up Dunn's butt.      LOL That was fun! BTW it is not to offend the fans of these players or their respective teams. Get some humor into your life!|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Hanks Aaron would get a baseball bat and beat Barry Bonds continuously over the head while telling him that he is The Real Home Run King.

Rollins meanwhile is running towards Reyes and trips over Hamels. Piazza at this point realizes what's happening and uses his leadership to gather all the Mets together. Carlos Beltran then follows his orders and runs straight at Shane Victorino, slides into him (as he would in a double play) and Victorino breaks his ankles.

nSSKixvCaa	I am not sure yet but it is about 170 dollars for the premier one for whole year including some other features. I watched an AFL game as well which was surprising but it was good. Depends on your internet speed but I think most bandwidth can support 1.2mb that some network offer in MLB.com and they are very clear and smooth. If you find it laggy, change it for 400kb. It is not like we are watching next American top model, you don't really need to see it so clearly. (My personal thoughts) Anyway, either way it was good enough for me.     I am in the UK and watching that and very few occasions, there is satellite disturbance but most of time, the quality is very good. I highly recommend it to you. I will buy the most expensive option this year again. It is about 20 dollars per month (7 month of regular and post season) but you can watch every game any time. I found it is affordable to me.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	I have the offseason package for $14.95. It has been a real treat. I get games back to 2006. I also listened to the 1968 WS and watched game 7.

AA10297143	The record books will always show Pittsburgh won a record 6th Super Bowl in 2009, however, any true fan of the sport will know that the Steelers are one of the dirtiest playing teams ever to suit up.  They have a worse reputation than the old Oakland Raiders ever thought about having.  Unfortunately, the brainwashed fans that follow them believe it is the way football is supposed to be played.  If you can't win fair, take out the QB, or punch someone when they are lying flat on their backs.

ITq5FNXuaa	no he is the best reciver in the league period. plus Nnamdi asomnaga (sorry if i spelt it wrong) is a free agent|`|XLXncQu9aa	No.  Wes Welker is one of the most underrated WR's in the league.  He has made the Patriots offense as dynamic as it is.  Randy Moss is a great WR, but the thing that every team needs is a 2 or 3 WR spread that can draw coverage away from the other.  The Patriots defense still have great players in its secondary.  Their defense doesn't need anymore additions to it at the moment.  They need to keep their high powered offense.  If they get rid of Welker, they won't have a WR other than Moss who can make plays at key moments.  Also he is useful to their special teams.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	no way, that is not equal value. there will be draft opportunities in the first and free agency is near.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Absolutely not. Welker is a key part of the Patriots offense, one of the fastest slot guys in the game, not to mention the league-leader in catches the past two regular seasons. With questions surrounding Brady, it would be in Belichick's best interest to keep all of Brady's prime targets in tact.|`|J4xsLrnoaa	NO WAY HE'S THE BEST SLOT RECEIVER IN FOOTBALL!!!!!|`|4kdlE54Paa	why would you want to do that?  Wes Welker is a important piece to the Patriots offense.  There is more to lose with his absence on the team.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	No,but I wish they would so the Dolphins could beat them easier!  P.S. GO DOLPHINS|`|UIi7B3UDaa	NO, they are going after Nnamdi if he goes into free agency, plus welker has been their most consistent preformer the past 2 seasons|`|zOw22PDyaa	no. just go get one in the draft|`|Txe8OwPJaa	No way.  Wes Welker is a great part of their offense.  He's come through for them time and time again, especially early on in the season when they weren't sure about Matt Cassel.  He draws attention now that the league has seen how dynamic he is, unlike when he was overlooked and underrated in Miami.  With a lot of focus on him & Moss, it spreads out and opens the defense. This gives the Pats many more options on offense (not something they've really struggled with though).  Welker is a great player, and he's definitely a game-changer for any team he plays on.|`|BTzkRvvgaa	Keep Welker  Officially change team name to Shitstain|`|tNerdFYsaa	Definatly not. There are a ton of great corners in the draft this year, and it seems over the past years that whoever they draft becomes a superstar, so no. also, Welker is an absolute beast and is so hard to cover and has so much speed. He is one of the reasons Moss has great success also|`|ZVjkgxmdaa	No way, CBs are so unpredictable from year to year and Wes Welker is a first down monster in the slot. Wes welker is the best slot receiver in the league and is in his prime. Hopefully he can stay healthy because he takes a pounding.    let me take a minute to say:    We miss you Wayne Chrebet, the toughest to ever go across the middle|`|E3wAsSjUaa	Absolutely not. He's the  2 receiver on the team. And after all the trouble of trying to acquire him, BB is not letting Welker go anywhere, anytime soon. BB will probably pick up a couple of rookie and veteran free agent CBs as usual.
AA10297143	A ticket holder you must be.  They are indeed from the stands.  I don't know of any lottery to get from the stands to the field.  It is simply a cow herding event to get them back before the second half kickoff.  None of the sites below focusing on the halftime show indicate an additional fee to get on the field, but there sure are high prices for everything else.|`|EUdHcGW1aa	I always wondered the same thing. The first answer makes sense. I can't imagine the NFL letting the fans run onto the field. That would be chaotic.|`|6e15k6h5aa	You must have a ticket to get onto the field.  You can buy them but it is very difficult to get any because they usually sell out the day they go up for sale.  A lot of websites or local radio stations will have "competitions" where the winner recieves tickets.
oHJ0ZEFqaa	Britt is a spectacular reciever. Thankfully, I have actually seen Britt play in person here at Rutgers. He is big, fast and is a future star of the NFL. He would definitely help any team he goes to. I don't know if Britt will be there by the time the Bears come in the second round because I think the Seahawks will get him before the Bears have a chance. I think the Bears will probably pick up an O lineman in the first round. If you are looking at a WR, check out Hakeem Nicks out of UNC. He is probably a lower prospect but still one of the better WR in the draft. At the QB position, look for Nate Davis and maybe Harrell. As for the RB position, maybe shonn greene for short yardage or devin moore who is kinda like Felix Jones. What you think?|`|qJwLCjK5aa	The waterboy. I hear there's just got fired :(|`|YkseyT7zaa	Good points, but I'd like to see the dominate defense again|`|fHxpycJSaa	Wide receivers. The Bears have the worst receiving corps in the NFL, but Angelo won't.|`|uj6v5MWBaa	the bears do need a wideout    i suggest dumping tommie harris to the lions for their 2 first round picks so the Bears can grab Crabtree and grab a DT with number 17 like akogbe then they draft mark sanchez and he'll become their starting qb in a few years    im sayin a few years because if mcnabb becomes a free agent, the Bears will jump on their hometown star and they should try to shed out money for tj housmanzadeh    suddenly they have tj housh and crabtree at wideout  they keep their tightend duo  they have mcnabb and sanchez can come in if mcnabb gets injured    they get a new DT akgobe or sometihng whose a beast       this is just a reach bu I wish this could happen|`|okECVBkzaa	Actually, he used the word "da" correctly. Its a saying by all races and cultures. "Da Bears" Idiot.    Back to the question, Id go WR, O-Line or CB. WR is an issue for sure and the pass defense was awful last year. A qb is risky, many early qb picks fail.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	It's "Da Bears" not "The Bears", just because it is named like that|`|u7GBP579aa	I think they may go Receiver, but they wont get crabtree because i think he will go to the seahawks so he will be gone by the time they pick. The reason I think they may not pick a receiver is because, the good tall ones may be gone, so they may go ol in the first round|`|Agl9ZpnEaa	THE...  It's english use it.  I'm sick of da dumb kids out there thinking dey gangsta.  Get real.|`|i0QzvbSnaa	I say that they should try to pick up a QB by trade or free agency just because there is not anyone who will help them in the draft. I would go OL and then look WR. It would be hard to take Sanchez in the first round without a lot of workout and interviewing him, especially with his coach basically saying that he is not ready for the NFL. They also do need to pick up some depth on the defensive line and even look at linebackers who could play on the end of the line.|`|kuh7CfcSaa	Everything starts with the O-Line.  If yours isn't working, then that is what needs to be addressed first.
LnJjS8BRaa	I agree, take a power nap. Don't load up on sugars and caffeine either, instead munch on some whole grain bread. The carbs will give you a more steady energy supply and won't cause you to crash like when all the sugar and caffeine wears off.    Take your lunch in a quiet place and set the alarm on your mobile. Have a nap and when you wake up and go back to work/school/cartoons eat your lunch.    Depriving yourself of sleep doesn't help you accomplish anything.|`|apr9gsgjaa	meditate for an hour|`|CVT6vf5Raa	why would you have to stay awake, take a nap and set an alarm.   you are only going to get your self creamed tonight in training and are not going to learn crap, if you are tired.|`|xhxnvPczaa	Lots of coffee bananas coke pepsi chocolate-that should help|`|m86H7GRSaa	try washing yr face constantly, and drinking coffee or tea will help. also always keep on playin lod music, so u dun sleep, tt always helps me  hope this helped :D

rNUyV1EYaa	There's a little interesting side tale about the Cowboys nickname.    General manager Tex Schramm originally wanted to call the team the Rangers; and many original team documents in early 1960 read "Dallas Rangers".    However, the name was changed several months before their first season to avoid confusion with the Texas rangers baseball team.    Television western shows were very popular at the time. So "Cowboys" was picked to give the team a heroic image that Americans could relate to.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	[ low ratings/I know]      Because cowboys are origanlly from Texas around the Dallas area. So I guess from then on.....they were called the Dallas Cowboys.    ...wow....I don't know my own teams history???    GO C-BOYS|`|4kdlE54Paa	It is the same as the San Francisco 49ers.  It is territorial history.  Texas was known for the many cowboys that worked in that state in the 1800's.  The 49ers because of the Gold Rush.    Here is something I found:    In the initial months following the its formation, the Dallas team was known as the Steers. After a few weeks, however, the name was changed to Rangers. At the same time, a baseball team operated in Dallas under that name, but was scheduled to fold before the 1960 football season. However, when the baseball team decided to play one more season, Clint Murchison Jr. and Bedford Wynne, owners of the new NFL team, selected the name of Cowboys to avoid confusion.     http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/dal...    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|5etFAmrsaa	Cause their homosexuals!|`|AA10065759	That is a no brainer.....    Dallas is located in Texas.....    Texas is associated with western stuff, cowboys, cattle drives, etc.    Dallas in Texas....Cowboys in Texas.....    DALLAS COWBOYS.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

TPZwmQK9aa	Since you live under a repressive government that limits your rights to this extent, you will either need to pick up a kitchen knife (many are identical to hunting knives, but they aren't illegal) or check with the theatrical department of your school about getting a prop (fake) knife.    Too bad you aren't nearby.  I just skinned two 'coons last night,and my knife is still bloody.  It was late, and I didn't have time to clean it up after spending 30 minutes getting all the blood off of my hands and arms.  I'm not kidding.  I still smell a bit like 'coon.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	There is no way any Hunter or trapper is going to give you a skinning knife to run us down more then we already are.  You should contact PETA they should have one left over form there many wrongful claims against hunters that are in the right.|`|LWxmRKnnaa	I don't think the guys that answer hunting questions are really gonna help you make them look bad.|`|AIH4QiQeaa	Who exactly is this moron? I thought we had elected all this type into public office so we could keep an eye on them. Sort of reminds me of the truly remarkable character that strolled into my shop years ago and handed me a Tasco 3-9x32. One of those $19.95 specials they used to sell at Kmart back in the 80's. He told me point blank...sight this in for me...He had no rifle, ammo, or even mounts. Just the scope. I wandered around in a daze for a week after that one. Jumpy and skittish. I never picked the scope up from where he laid it, and he returned a week later to pick it up. He asked me if it was ready. I just gawked at him and nodded to the thing laying there and told him 'no charge'.|`|2Yxw6xpPaa	1) Since you live in England, possession of knives is regulated  as an offensive weapon and prohibited by law in schools, you could be looking at a hefty fine and a trip to the police station.  2) I see the PETA has infiltrated your school with their anti hunting/anti fur agenda.You should learn to start to think for yourself.  3) I really don't think a bloody knife with fur sticking on it  looks cool or shocking enough to get a good grade. You really should go out into the woods and learn what wildlife is really about. There is a lot of hunting and meat eating going on, its called Nature.  4) The word is "Advise". Heres some "Advice": Rather than doing artsy propaganda for the lunatic  fringe groups like PETA, why don't you focus on the basics like Reading , Grammar, Spelling and Math?|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Jeez, first they stole your guns, and now they won't even let you have knives!     Thanks for the heads up. If we Americans want to keep our knives, we better not let 'em get our guns!|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I DON'T KNOW, BUT TRAVIS, YOU GAVE ME A GOOD LAUGH.

ucot94w3aa	Yes, Burton is the only manufacturer with a different bolt hole pattern.  Aside from them, all bindings should mount to all snowboards without a problem.  And the Ride RX bindings will mount to both of the boards you mentioned.|`|QkBJeSyeaa	Normally they give you a oval shaped holes in order to fit slight variations between companies.  As long as you have the correct plate with the correct number of holes you should be fine|`|a1xU4KsOaa	Yes for the most part.  Burton has their 3D and ICS/EST system apart from the rest of the industry's 4x4 pattern.    ICS/EST is based off of Forum's I-Lock system from a few seasons ago I think, so if you come across any of those, it won't be the same.      Splitboards are different too, but it's rare to see those.
4owr19vCaa	I have to agree, best leave it as is.  I have one 99% of the time it's holstered and forgotten about.    A good alternative to what you want that is relatively cheap would be this MAC11:    Tactical Force TF11 Co2  http://www.airgundepot.com/tactical-forc...  $66    It has all the (dis)advantages that Dimitri mentions :)  Plus, something the C11 lacks - blowback!  Cheapest full auto blowback I am aware of.  Stock up on Co2 you only get 2 1/2 mags at best.    these are recommended with the TF11:    Leapers MAC11 Holster    http://www.airgundepot.com/leapers-mac11...  $20    Tactical Force TF11 Airsoft Magazine  http://www.airgundepot.com/tafotfaima.ht...  $23      cheers|`|Y4mz8BShaa	No.  And your advantages be:  1. Having a broken pistol.  2. Emptying your magazine before you actually need your pistol.  3. Emptying CO2 cartridges at an extreme rate.

6en8QlaUaa	The reason you can't find bulletproof pants and such is because a "bulletproof vest" is designed to protect your vital organs.   The manufacturers don't have a high demand for other bulletproof garments so thet don't make them.    I can, however, help you find what you're looking for.    Here is a website that custom makes bulletproof garments for you.  http://www.fortierandco.com/custom_armor...  They can make almost any garment into a "bulletproof" garment, as long as the material can support the extra weight.    As far as your head goes, you will want a kevlar helmet like the military wears. It is rated kevlar just like the vests.    Here is a link for helmets. groin protectors, side plates to complete the protection of the vest.  http://www.bulletproofme.com/Body_Armor_...    These are actual sites that I have purchased product from.  I hope this information helps you.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	there's no such thing as bullet resistant pants, underwear, etc.  a bullet resistant vest is made to protect your vital organs, that's it, there's no reason to add more weight to somebody to protect their shin, knee, forearm, upper arm, etc from a bullet, that's why police only put on a bullet resistant vest on instead of a whole suit, imagine how heavy and bulky that would be, you couldn't move or at least not well.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	they dont make any of that the only thing that you could buy is a helmet.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Why man? Are you afraid of someone blowing your *alls off.|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	If you find anyone who makes bulletproof underwear I would love to hear about it. As far as anything else I would look under Kevlar or armor.|`|2Yxw6xpPaa	Science fiction magazines....  Seriously. If there was such a thing do you think we would have our soldiers killed by bullets? There are types of bullet proof vests that are limited to their effective range. This would be limited to  low power handgun calibers and they use a type of plate called a trauma plate that only covers most of the wearers vital area, heart, lungs, liver.|`|1d4Vin3Waa	What I would do is contact Stark Industries and Wayne Industries to see if they have any spares in your size. If you can't find their websites you might just try Marvel.com or D.C. Comics.com, they might have a link.

0ytjj1EGaa	Both R SAME|`|AA11488609	Equal.  The press loves Kobe and LeBron equally.  Nike obviously likes LeBron more since they have their own specifc brand for him, but you also have to consider the fact that Kobe originally started out with Adidas and then switched to Nike, so definitely that played a factor into why Kobe doesn't get much of anything from Nike despite his skills on the court.|`|dqgAH3sEaa	I have to agree... Kobe is over-rated.  I know he scored 61 points last night.  No one will talk about how he took over 45 shots in 36 minutes.  He is not a team player by any means.      Lebron is a much better all around player and its not even close.

DhEZj9cKaa	It depends on how many drugs you have done|`|EroXBvDNaa	I just skied again after 17 years, and I remembered how to do it.

Unless you are pretty old, I'm sure you will remember the event. I would suggest that the ability you had as of the last time you went skiing will be the ability that you will start off with this year.     I am forever amazed by the fact that I can ski just as well at the beginning of the season each year as I skied at the end of the previous season. The body remembers even if the brain doesn't. The only down side is that I'm never in as good shape at the beginning as I was at the end and I had better stop skiing that day before I get hurt.|`|rFQXKD64aa	Odly enough, it is like riding a bike... you never forget how to ski. The only thing likely to change is how fit you are.   Are you still in shape (assuming you were last time)? If you haven't excercised in a while, THAT is going to make a big difference in your skiing ability and skills.    Also, if you're worried about having forgotten everything, take it easy at first, and go through all the basic moves again (would suck realizing you've forgotten how to slow down - or if you're a beginner, how to snow plough!). This site has a bunch of online ski lessons" you can read before you leave, just in case : http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_less...|`|lzZDTM9saa	you might be a little bit worse than you were last year, but after a few runs you'll be just fine.  take it slow at first and just have fun!|`|7lTIiL60aa	just remember pizza french fries pizza french fries (skiers know what i mean)

xsNaCNBaaa	Most horses with a fear of the clippers can learn to get over it.  My first move would be to find out if she is afraid of the clippers when they aren't turned on.  Start on her shoulder, which is the least sensitive part of the horse and start running them all over her.  If she is ok with them off, then the 2 things that could be bothering her are the noise and the vibration.  You can put earplugs in to see if the noise is what is causing the problem.  Tack stores sell ear plugs specifically for horses that are safe to use.  If it is the vibration that bugs her it will take a bit more time to get over.  I recommend NOT tying the mare.  I would get someone else to hold her and if she wants to move around, let her, as long as she doesn't run away.  Get some cordless clippers so you can follow her.  Start them and touch the clippers to your arm and then place your hand on her shoulder.  This will allow the vibration to travel down your arm, but not be as intense.  As she gets used to this, move the clippers closer to her until they are touching her.  The second she starts to be frightened, back off, but don't turn them off completely.  Just take things very very slowly, and when you reach a point where she stands still even for a second and relaxes, then be done for the day and try again later.  with lots of patience she should come around.

jTaW3goeaa	For me I prefer 26 or below with low humidity.  In talking with the mountain manager where I board, they've been unable to make snow in temps as low as 26 degrees.      Personally I love it when its below zero with wind chills at 40 below.  This keeps a lot of people off the mountain and you almost have the entire mountain to yourself.|`|DhEZj9cKaa	20 degrees, 6-8" freshies, still comin down, midweek, no crowds.|`|4EesoL2xaa	"Ideal" can be different for a lot of people.  Some like it when it is below 25 degrees, other people like spring skiing.      It also depends where you are.  I live in the northeast, so conditions out here differ greatly from conditions in say, Utah.     My personal opinion is that I like it best when it is just below 32, sunny, with little or no wind.      You also have to take the snow conditions into account, because if there has been a warmer dry spell for a few days prior to the day you go, the snow will most likely be mush on top of a thick layer of ice, which is never fun.  Its usually best to go anytime after there have been four or five consecutive cold cold days, even if it hasn't snowed.  99% of mountains have their own snowmaking, so the snow is usually in good shape even if it hasn't snowed for a while, as long as its been cold.|`|GZCmyzBYaa	for me i like powdery snow because it's the least dangerous and i kinda like it warm but not super warm, it's very unpleasant when you ski when it's very cold so i'd say like 30-32 F? Oh and no wind chills it's terrible. So yea if you wanna ski go for it it's so much fun!|`|qyATAaeXaa	My ideal day would be partly sunny skies with puffy white clouds, low humidity, no wind, and temps around 28F. This of course would be at 7:00am after it has just dumped about 12"-15" of fresh pow.|`|cG2hN2buaa	I'm pretty sure you mean downhill skiing, but in case you mean cross country skiing, which is my main sport, it is best for freestyle if there is new snow and cold, then two or three days of almost melting or a lot warmer, and then a drop to a colder temperature, the snow melts fast under your skis and is slightly icy but not dry. With these conditions I can ski a 5km in just over 12 min instead of 15 min on a plain cold day or too warm of a day.  For classic fresh snow with icy tracks but not to the point when hard waxes will give no grip    personally, although its slower, for me the colder the better because I'm good with cold weather while my competition is mostly not giving me the edge, last week was a 15km race with a -46 wind chill...4th place out of 53 :P|`|2UOSEqqPaa	for me, i like blue skies, no new snow for like at least 3 days, eh 32 degrees for the snow to warm up, no wind, perfect visabiltiy|`|Vr79EjBZaa	It all comes down to what type of skier you are...  My mother for example loves Spring Skiing.  Typically the weather is 40-60 degrees and lots of sun.  I've been skiing in a T-shirt which is fun but the snow sucks really bad.      My Ideal Conditions are 20-30 degrees with sunny to partly cloudy sky and freshly groomed snow.   If I go tree skiing it must be COLD to make sure the Powder remains light and soft.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	There are two professional sides in Scotland - Glasgow and Edinburgh.    The present leaders (and likely champions) of the Scottish Premier League are Ayr.|`|d6Qb1GCQaa	Yes . . . you can just turn up to any amature club's training session and then join there club!    No one will pay you to play or anything tho! And US college level isnt that high so you should look to start off in the Scottish Lower leagues    National League 2 or 3 and then if you seem to good or its to easy you can move on to a bigger club!|`|jKU499Feaa	Yes.    Its not a transfer though. You have to be contracted to play for a Scottish club. Someone has to want you, in other words. Unfortunately American players won't get all that much exposure and to be honest, if you're good enough to play club rugby in Europe you're probably good enough to be on the USA national team. Feel free to go to school or live in Scotland and play there (for a school or a local club which you don't get paid for). I presume you're looking to play professionally though, in which case its up to someone (a professional club) to contract you.     It is possible but unlikely that a European team will want you and the American national team doesn't. To get noticed by a club, you will probably have to play for the American national side.    If you mean "Do I have to play for Scotland to play for a Scottish club?" then of course not. But I think you're referring to playing for USA.    Club teams all over the world are independent of the national teams and apart from having to have 'x' number of local players they are free to contract players from all over the world.    Dan Lyle, the U.S.A captain played for Bath in England. He captained them in fact to a Guinness Premiership victory IIRC. In places like North America, Argentina and eastern Europe there are no professional rugby structures. Most of the Argentinian national squad plays for European clubs.    The best Scottish teams are Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Gunners. They both play in the Heineken Cup.     http://www.edinburghrugby.org/  http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/    Search for Glasgow upsetting Toulouse recently on http://www.rugbydump.com for highlights.
G5uw3lo8aa	I would hazard a guess that he was sick of the attention from the media and just needed to get it all behind him so he could get on with life. I can understand if that is his reason why he would retire. Still should have played until he was 50 I reckon.|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Yeah good Question..

McGain is the man so they just picked him...|`|4FjMKFmtaa	Because Warne had been playing test cricket for so many years, he was probably physically and mentally spent where McGain hasn't had to deal with touring the world and playing cricket for the majority of the year over the15+ years so he can probably have a good two or 3 years in him and hoepfully by then a young spinner will emerage (fingers crossed)

LPO8RlVdaa	Oh dear bloody god.     First of all, there is no way in hell any reputable Dojo would teach or let a student at that novice level train in or even touch a weapon. Second of all at that novice level he would yet to have mastered the basic art of Karate itself, never mind the Nunchucku, Sai or Bo, and the Wakizashi  (I am assuming that is what you meant) is not a sword he would train in in the manner you mean.    Please, I beg you for your sons sake, educate yourself - and tell your son to do the same - in the martial arts before you let him quite literally play with things he would not understand.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	bo, sai and nunchaku take decades to master. you dont just twirl them around.  a wakizashi, is a razor sharp short sword that can cut your arm off. i have see experts slip and loose fingers and toes, this is not something for a child to use.  the do sell them that are not sharp, i dont teach children this weapon or the nunchaku because of how dangerous they are. nor do i teach those 2 to anyone under 1st kyu    edit:> a lot of do not consider weapons toys, i person teach no one under the age of 12 any weapon and have ages set for certain weapons.  there are too many place that do not know how to use martial art weapons correctly, they just teach students to twirl them in the air. because its fun for them, nunchaku i consider one that is very dangerous more to the user, used correctly they can generate enough force to break the skull. used incorrectly they put the user in the hospital.   the place your son trains, to me sounds like a mcdojo.to be using that many weapons at a young age or a low rank is to much, for most people to learn anything useful.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	As Shihan said I seriously doubt that your son ahs mastered any of thes eweapons. Can he spar weapon to weapon and not getkilled? can he perform the techniques in the kata without thinking about them, and the weapon is an extention of his body? Does he go to a school where the main emphasis is on tournaments? I bet he does because in most traditional classes he would not even ick up a wepon until green or blue belt. I am sur ehe has learned to twirl them around, but does he understand what he is doing with them?    If he likes what he is doing great, however do not let anyone there tell him he has mastered ay of these weapons. As for the sword the only one it could be is what has been stated above.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I have a really funny feeling that the only reason a wakizashi is used is because junior is too young/small for a full size katana...    I believe that he can probably twirl the weapons around and maybe even knows a couple patterns for each. But this is far from mastering them as the above have pointed out.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	the sword will be wakizashi.    green belt in karate and using nunchucks, staffs and sais and then wakizashi?    Can I give a friendly suggestion?  The dojo your son training in.....it sounds like a McDojo. There is no way in the world that a respectable karate dojo will teach all those weapons at that level and then label your kid as already mastered the weapons at that level.  Not to mention Karate itself means 'Way of the Empty Hand'  Meaning that Karate do not use weapons in their practice.  Since the weapon of choice include nunchuck and sais (which falls more on the fancy side than effective side) I'd say it's more like a Ninjutsu schools (which are about 90% McDojos)    I suggest pull your kid out of that school and put him in a decent BJJ school. Younger kid who is flexible (at least he should be flexible training in Martial Art already) will benefit much more from BJJ (Brazilian Jujitsu) and able to achieve higher level easier due to his flexibility.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I think you need to find a better school. There is no way someone could master or even understand these weapons without at least 10 years in each weapon.|`|DxS5CbG6aa	wakizashi?    it's kind of like a short sword, mostly used as an off-hand weapon    http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/0071...|`|w21swqcFaa	http://www.martialartssupermarket.com/in...      Try that. Look through that website and see if you can find it.|`|hBLNIlYGaa	wakizashi.     though i've never heard of it being used in karate. technically speaking in most okinwan arts (karate) ...weapon work is called kobudo, or kobujutsu.|`|6nGII584aa	wakizashi its pretty much just a short katana.    whats the question? if you need to find somewhere good to buy it i sugest talking to the intrcutor first.    but in karate they shouldnt be useing weapons till brown or black belt.|`|uToFh7Beaa	Tonfa might be a good one for him to learn or possibly Kama (rubber or wooden of course)

Overall thats pretty good but around 5:00-5:30 would be amazing.    Good luck!  Hope i helped!  ;D|`|SOt3a4xYaa	It depends on your gender and whether you are considering the time 'fast' for recreational purposes or 'fast' for a sport such as track or cross country. For recreational purposes, that is amazing for a girl and pretty great for a guy as well. However, at my school to qualify for the outdoor track state championships a girl would have to break 5:42. I'm not positive about the guys, but I'm sure you can get the basic gist of it all (my guess would be 5:10-5:15). There is a guy at my school who can run a 4:19 mile (I know it seems utterly impossible- he's gone to all of these national meets and such) and he still isn't state champion. But remember,these runners train for years to get this great. If you are just beginning then I believe you have a great running career ahead of you!! Good luck!|`|GTSKO9Ueaa	Matters on your height/weiight/and gender.     It is not a bad time but not really that competitive. A good scoree though.

LGVrhTFTaa	Anytime you can improve your keepers; through 3 for 2,or 2 for 1 trades it is  worth it..And draft picks become a lot less important because of the top players being unavailable..  I think you could redraft Liriano if you don't keep him..But,I also feel he should have a strong year,and is worthy of being kept..But if you trade A.Rod; who will be your 3rd baseman?(Unless Miggy still has 3rd base eligibility.) If Miggy doesn't have 3rd base eligibility I'd try to trade him instead of A.Rod,first...Or better yet offer sumthen like Kemp+Tiexiera+  Miggy+a draft pick for Pujols+Reyes.(My thinking is A.Rod will rebound,and have a monstrous year with Tex. hitting in front,or behind him.    ~g0()d Luck!~|`|UoT86gbiaa	I know position scarcity is a little overrated, but with no 2B, SS, or closer you're going to be hurting, especially for steals and saves.  You have 3 corner infielders in the form of A-Rod, Cabrera, and Teixeira.  Cabby should be eligible at either corner, so you can move any 1 of the three without losing anything from your starting lineup (I'd try to move Tex as I hate to have key players from the same team and he won't get you the steals that A-Rod will).    Starting pitchers can be had, as a number of very good arms typically cluster around the top 100 players.  I think CC is a little overrated and Peavy's in flux (he'll probably get traded from that lovely pitcher's park).  See if you can package Tex and one of those SPs (possibly Tex + CC to a Yankee homer, as there's at least one in every league) to help address one of the thin positions.  Then consider not keeping the other SP in favor of your best closer from last year.  Even though that closer might be outside the overall top 80, he'll have more value to you at the start of a draft than a 2nd or 3rd SP.

DkYJ44gYaa	Okay, if you only weigh 140 you are not built like the bus.  If I was you I would concentrate on speed.  There are lots of speed drills you can do.  Also practice catching the ball being multitalented always helps you get 1st string.  If your 5'5 and 140 your small for football but that doesnt mean you cant be dominate.  Do a lot of weight lifting that involves your thighs, calves and butt.  They are the most important part of a RB.

DRPhJnXzaa	Most definitely !|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Nope|`|H1VIZsutaa	Can't argue with that. Although, the Packers have the most NFL titles. The Steelers weren't good until the 70's. (They were founded in the 30's.)|`|RZIV15e3aa	No.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Yep.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I do not.    The Steelers Do Not Have:  20 Consecutive Winning Seasons.  The NFL All Time Leading Rusher.  *Most appearances in a Super Bowl (8)  *Most wins on Monday night Football (41)  *Most appearances in the NFC Championship game (14)  *The Cowboys' streak of 160 sold-out regular and post-season games included 79 straight sellouts at their home, Texas Stadium, and 81 straight sell-outs on the road.  *Cowboys are the most valuable football franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $1.612 billion.  *They are also one of the wealthiest teams in the NFL, generating almost $250 million in annual revenue.  *Most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985)  *Most seasons with at least 10 wins (24)  *The team has earned the most postseason appearances (28, which includes another league record of 55 postseason games, winning 32 of them)  *The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls in just 4 years. (Also the only other team to do that is the Pats)        Dallas best vs Steelers best    Passing Leader (all-time): Troy Aikman - 32,942 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Emmitt Smith - 17,162 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Michael Irvin - 11,904 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Tom Landry - 250 wins    Passing Leader (all-time): Terry Bradshaw - 27,989 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Franco Harris - 11,950 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Hines Ward - 9,780 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Chuck Noll - 193 wins      The Steelers got 6 Super Bowls in 76 years. Dallas has won it 5 times 49. I'm not great at math but by my account, we have 27 years to catch up. They still trail Dallas 32-31 in playoff wins despite nearly a 3 decade head start and our more than dozen year drought in the postseason.|`|pXJ9peT2aa	Steelers are the best football team in HISTORY|`|C2CCbTRKaa	THEY MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BEST,BUT IT,S HARD TOO PICK A BEST TEAM,JUST TOO MANY GOOD TEAMS.|`|JTSNljLhaa	no not even the best in the AFC|`|DpPCs6fPaa	RaGS sez : Might I possibly disagree with your thesis?|`|5xIroQjMaa	The Steelers are one of the three best franchises in history. The Cowboys, the 49ers and the Steelers. The Cowboys are the most winning franchise in history, and the 49ers had the best dynasty in history. The Steelers were in between. Not as winning as the Coyboys, and their best dynasty years weren't as dominant as the 49ers. Where does that put the three franchises? Well, about on even ground. Probably the Cowboys have the edge, as much as I hate to admit it.|`|30LMCJrAaa	I would have to say the highest achievement an NFL team can attain is the perfect season. I am not a Miami or New England fan at all, however the perfect season en bodies all that is perfection. To go out there week in and week out and win every time...that's something!     The problem with saying that six rings is the height of perfection is that you are talking about totally different teams.

2octF5dIaa	Incredible player who is extremely underrated.  Last year was an off season but now that he is playing well he is one of the best in the league, almost as good as Ovechkin if you ask me.  He is totally underrated and watch for him to play well at the Olympics next year.      Ryan Miller is a beast.  Best American goaltender.  Only problem is Lindy Ruff plays Lalime too much.  He could win a Vezina trophy at some point and is gonna be the starter for USA at 2010 Olympics.|`|bwaJxtx7aa	vanek is finally makin his money and hes playin really good and ryan miller was playin amazin but has gone down in the past couple seasons ( and my fav team is the redwings)|`|OL7gNJooaa	well i live in buffalo and damn vanek had a hattrick last night but seriously hes a good player hes no  one who likes to dilly daley around everyone he just shoots and apparently its working he has 31 now and yesterday was sick 5 to 0. i think hes awesome|`|xZJZNpIlaa	vaneks alright and so isnt miller. they are both pretty hot goalies with alot of skill but if i had to pick a goalie right now it wouldnt be one goalie but a group of goalies for the boston bruins. they are on a roll with thomas fernandez and the new guy tuuka rask. they are playing hot right now but back to your question id say that vanek is a pretty good goalie and i wouldnt mind him on my team|`|IQpGAJERaa	huge sabres fan as well. vanek was probably overpaid, but has been a tank this year. if he can keep this up, he will hav lived up to the salary. ithink timmy conolly is the most talented player on the sabres and ryan miller is having his best year.

You almost have to overpay a goalie who is decent as they're so hard to come by. It would be nice if they gave him a rest every now and then.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	Unfortunately, I'm not able to see much of Vanek. But I saw a lot of him when he played for the U of Minnesota.

WUuO6wbAaa	Let him retire. He should have taken 2 year/45 million, nonetheless 1 year/25 million. He wants a long term deal because he's getting old. His worth may not be the same if he can't produce the same way. He was incredible in the postseason. Boras may say he wants 5 years, the same way how he said that for Oliver Perez, but he's realistic. If he can get 3 years for Perez, who there was no competition for, or Lowe for 4 years and 60 million, while no other team was near that figure, he should be able to get Manny at least 2 or 3 years. Maybe not though. His best bet is to sign a one year deal now and than sign with the Yankees when they have 3 OF's (Matsui, Damon, Nady) who'll become free agents after this season (it adds up to 32.55 million).    He's going to try to wait this thing out. If he doesn't play, it won't help his value for next off-season. It'll drop it considerably. What you're seeing happen is a decline in the baseball market. Even putitng that aside though, it's February, and almost spring training. At this point, players rarely sign for large deals. Boras should have convinced Texeira to sign with the Nats, considering he was actually offered more money there, because he wouldn't have destroyed Manny Ramirez market (the Yankees) in the process of doing so.    I highly doubt Minaya would trade Delgado and sign Manny, which they have the ability to do, but I'd probably do it. Delgado's paid 12 million and can get them back a couple prospects or relievers from a team like the Angels or Giants, while Manny will probably need to be offered at least 22 million per year for 2 years to sign there. All that speculation seems to have gone away though with Minaya saying their won't be any more major off-season moves. Manny's reputation of playing down when he's upset and pushing an old man has come back to haunt him. Not to the Barry Bonds level, but still, most teams appear not to be interested in him.|`|szkrumAJaa	He's cashing in before he becomes obsolete.|`|pXJ9peT2aa	just manny being manny...that's all    -stupid-|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	I'm with you - stupid|`|UE3smuAJaa	a complete ^&* *%%%$^&^*^%$()%^&$@@$^!@^%^* ^$%$$%^^&&^...    i am a bostoner, he was good, then he was decent, then he was bad, then he was manny.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Who gives a **** about him      GO RED SOX!|`|KVeenOGAaa	You are right. I hope that piece of crap misses out on the season, never plays again and goes bankrupt. What a filthy, greedy piece of crap.|`|AA12040384	I agree on the him being stupid part,that's for sure.  I mean he is obviously ignorant of how our country's (not to mention everyone else's) economy is doing currently and i think he just wants attention,that's really it.I mean no sober person would turn down a 25 million dollar deal.Plus it also makes no sense because last year he said he would like to retire as a Dodger,and hes getting older..closer to retirement..it only makes sense that he's on the Dodgers now so he can retire,like he said he would like to,being a Dodger.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	I guess I don't know that hole deal with manny but why did he leave the Sox last season?or did he get traded and why?|`|AA11041009	I think Scott Boras has his ear, and I think Mr. Boras knows Manny can get a better deal.  The Dodgers still want Manny, even after being rejected a second time, which would seem to suggest that Boras is right.      Go Dodgers.    Giants suck.|`|jKOB7n35aa	I personally like him, even though he treated us like crap in his final days in Boston. He will still be rememebered as one of the greatest Red Sox players in history and as a key cog in both World Series championships. He is stupid for not taking that deal. Boras has screwed every one of his free agents this year.

E3wAsSjUaa	I'm 100% positive that Cassel will remain in NE for this season. Brady is coming off a huge injury and I think it's going to take him a couple of games to get back into playing a whole game. Cassel knows the system and he'd be the perfect insurance policy should anything happen to Brady again.     And since a team would have to gives up 2 1st rounders to the Pats to aquire Cassel, it's highly likely that a trade will occur.|`|okECVBkzaa	I think he stays.

AA10297143	I would really expect the A's to finish almost the same as last year.  I don't think they have ponied up enough to catch the Angels yet.|`|KTp27Fokaa	My bold prediction for this division actually has the A's winning this division.    They made a huge signing in Matt Holiday which should improve their line-up drastically. He should make the hitters in front of him much better.    They always pitch well, the problem has been hitting, and this year I think that will end.    I think the Angels won't get into the playoffs. They lost a few pieces and are getting older.      I come here sometimes, though it is a little boring in the off-season. I will be very active here during the middle of the season.|`|AA10495394	I actually I believe they have a shot at winning the AL west because the Angels will be down a little without K-rod and Teixeira. I think with good pitching and Chavez coming back if he can stay healthy the A's can make the Playoffs|`|0ylaEVtraa	last place|`|NOEJMDfiaa	I predict a better season for the A's, however I think it will be a sub-par one. I am not confident in their starting rotation outside of Duchscherer.|`|n6Z0GEhqaa	They will lose every game|`|HeWUbyHJaa	I think they could surprise teams. Giambi and Holiday add some much needed offense and their pitching is always pretty good. I think they could challenge the Angels this year, maybe even with a trade deadline move for another hitter. A lot will depend on the health of Chavez and their pitchers.|`|e4UtQc9Yaa	The A's will compete, and whether they can win the division will depend on two things - Eric Chavez's health and production when healthy, and the back end of the rotation.     Chavez, the last time he was completely healthy, hit 30+ HRs and drove in a lot of runs, but has struggled to stay in the lineup. If he can play, and play to his previous levels, he will be a great compliment to Holliday, Giambi, and Cust.     The back end of the rotation is young and inexpierenced, but if they can produce, and Oakland pitchers usually do, then they can really be a threat to the all mighty angels.
axxQzOCHaa	for skates, well as you know indoor RH is usually played on sport court, and outdoors on concrete, so you gotta use different hardness wheels. suppose you could use an in-between one for grip and durability on both, like an 80a, because truthfully a 6 year old isn't going to put that much pressure into the surface and wear out the wheels that quickly.    as far as the stick goes, how about a Reebok 1k, kids outgrow sticks so quickly it's pointless to get her a composite, and this stick, like the Koho which you're probably thinking about, has an ABS blade so that it won't delaminate too quickly if she drags it along concrete but is more than strong enough for her shot on an indoor surface.|`|F934e4HQaa	I HAVE THAT STICK AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR OUTDOOR AND INDOOR HOCKEY

Yr5zBsIHaa	just keep trying|`|XwO62rVFaa	if you keep at it you'll get alot better, im not sure how long youve been sprinting but stuff like that doesnt usually come overnight x) if you did your hill runs before sprints, you could have just been tired.|`|SOt3a4xYaa	I am a cross country runner and we trained everyday (sometimes twice a day- i'm talking 5:30 am practices) for the entire season. The sport began on August 1st and concluded with the state championship meet on November 8th. In just over three months I managed to increase my 5K time from 26:02 to 21:27. I cannot lie to you though- it was the most physically and mentally challenging three months of my entire life. The freaky thing is that I absolutely LOVED it. You get the most amazing feeling when you cross the finish lines of races, knowing that all of the hard work paid off. Ok, so let me get to the point: If you want to get really good at track, train 6 days a week. Create a training schedule that consists not only of sprinting. Here is what I suggest:    Monday: Speed work! Do crazy extreme sprints around a track. In cross country we would consecutively sprint a 400m, 800m, 1200m, 1600m, 1200m, 800m, 400m. Between each round we would have a 5-10 minute break. Trust me, you will feel like you want to die, but you HAVE to do it.  Tuesday: Hit the weight room! Do some weight lifting! You will need strong leg muscles. Then go for a 3-4 mile jog/run.  Wednesday: Practice sprints for your event: 200m.  Thursday: Find some sort of trail/path (anywhere that is safe to run long distances). Wear a pedometer. Sprint 1/4 mile, then jog 1/4 mile repeatedly for a distance of 5-6 miles.  Friday: Take it easy. Do a 3-4 mile jog.  Saturday: Try to take a stationary bike class at a local YMCA or ride a regular bike intensely, through hilly terrain. Sprint 200m like crazy!   Sunday: Rest!!    *This was similar to the cross country training scedule from a coach who has been coaching for over 20 years. Of course, whe did many more longer runs instead of 200m sprints, but we did do a ton of speed work.  *As for your diet, you should try to cut out all the 'C-foods'. That was the cross country rule. Any unhealthy foods that start with C: cookies, cake, carbonated drinks, candy, etc. Eat foods high in carbohydrates and protein. About an hour and a half before a race eat a peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole wheat bread (this has the perfect combo of nutrients needed for quick-energy release). Continue drinking a TON of water. You should also check into taking an Iron vitamin supplement. Iron-deficiency is common among runners and results in exhaustion.  *Whenever you feel like quitting all of this crazy insanity, remember your goal: TO GET BETTER (set a goal time you want to break)! And remember, you are SUPPOSED to hurt when you run. If you aren't hurting then aren't giving everything you've got.  *Oh yes, and make sure you stretch before and after running EVERYDAY!!    Good luck!!!!!!!!!|`|Vf4iXFXhaa	Are you a girl? Cause no offense 36-38 is horrible. i run in the PIAA and my time is around 23-24 but honestly.. you just gotta push it all the way. if ur hititng the 30s u should honestly switch to long distance.|`|pkoWA5HNaa	Don't set time goals for next week or next month, but next year i.e. 32 seconds June 2010. Concentrate on speed work in the summer months (what you are doing sounds ok) and strength and stamina in the winter. You won't always and you don't need to always do good times in training - think more about how you body feels after a session. You need to spend loads of time on stretching (30 mins min before and also during) and also vary your reps i.e. 75m, 150m, 250m. If you want to, try having a break from doing 200m.

Look on youtube to help with sum of your  jumps      Things you may also want to consider working on :  Splits  Roundoff/cartwheels/Back handsprings         Streches  Do one leg in front of you bent and then one in back flat lean forward for 30secs and then lean back hangs by ur feet for 30 sec and then slidei nto ur splits     Sit on ur butt and but ur leggs out and make a V formation lean to the right then to left keep ur knees up to the celing!!!! Go to the right, left, and middle hold for 30 secs each.    Do ur reg. Arm exercises. The one hand over thing and then behind your head.    For your pike jump  when you jump have ur torso up and ur arms out and ur toes pointed!!!!     Toe touch is pretty hard and im still trying to master this.   have ur legs out into ur middle split kind of thing...And your arms up and reach for ur toes but dont acutally touch them have ur back up and look forward.      Another exercise go to ur steps and have ur arms back you facing the oppisite side of ur steps and do the dips.     Take ur leg put it on a couch, something kinda high... and put it there and strech it.         When you try out do lots of smileing!!! School colors!!! And try to show them all of ur tumbling!!!!!|`|LlaLuDvlaa	You should be pretty flexible from all of your dance experience. Maybe you could ask your dance instructor.|`|vcuX3Krqaa	OKAY- this is going to be really long- but hang in there and hear me out- this will help    i've been an allstar cheerleader for 6 years and there are alot of things you can do. Mostly, you need to stretch.. ALOT. like sit and watch the tv in a split for 30 minutes or so. do this for each split.. left, right, and middle. do this everyday. also, do your basic stretches like straddle, pike, all those things.   also.. you have to EXERCISE and do lots of different things. Run around your block everyday or around your house a couple times.  do lots of crunches and other ab work-outs. abs help out alot.   also with stretching.. lay on your back with your legs up and put your butt on the wall. let your legs slide down the wall towards the floor and have your mom push them farther down every 2-5 minutes.   also, you can sit down in a straddle and raise your right leg about 6 inches off the ground and do tiny little butterfly kicks. switch to your left leg, then do both at the same time. these will help ALOT with your heel-stretches, jumps, bow-and-arrows, and your scorpians.   FLEXIBILITY IS KEY. trust me. once you do all your stretches and exercise, go in your backyard and pracitce your jumps (or on your trampoline is you have one).   You obviously got dance down, so work on really tight motions and techniques. like it your hands are suppose to be in fists, make sure the thumb part of your hand is showing.. not the other side.. and that your thumbs are inside your fists. some coaches prefer to have your thumbs outside- but it doesn't really matter. make sure your arms are really tight and you don't hunch up your shoulders whenever you put your arms up- which is what a lot of people do. when you run, keep your arms by your side in blades, and stay really tight.  Also practice standing on one foot and pulling your stunting skills. It's really hard to have balance on one foot but you'll get the hang of it eventually.  Watch shows on tv that give those yoga lessons. yoga also helps alot with abs. and abs are really important  you probably think i'm going way overboard with this stuff, but once you go to tryouts- they'll be amazed. you can skip a couple days or two, its not SUPER important that you do it every single day.   i hope this helps! [[p.s.- best answer? i really need 10 points- thanks (:]]  good luck! and email me if you need anymore helps (:

r5AMG8g7aa	Having been around many TKD dojang, I must say that I would not send my worst enemy to an ATA school.   If you do a little research on the internet, you will find many threads where people that have been students under the ATA are really ticked off at the junk they were taught and the high fees charged at an ATA school. It is not just one or two fo their Schools it is the ATA in general.     Someone else mentioned that the ATA does not associate with any other TKD organization. they do not allow students from other TKD styles to compete in their tournaments. Neither do they compete in other tournaments. They want their students kept away from any other styles. I met the head instructor at the local one a few weeks ago. He has been training over 17 years. He si about to test for his 5th dan. He is a nice guy. However what he is teaching his black belts is absolute garbage. His technique is good, but his knowledge is no where near the rank he wears.   NOTE: I rarely ever put make negative comments about other styles. In this case, I feel the truth must be told. The quality of training is very low. Fees are way to high as are the testing fees. Way to many of the students are promoted to black belt ranks. The quality and knowledge is just not there.    EDIT:  Charmed.....   The fact that you do ATA TKD and plan on opening an ATA school brings no surprise to me that you support the ATA. Sorry if you feel that I hate TKD. That simply is not true. What is true is the many ATA belt-mills that I've personally witnessed. I'll stake my experience level against your any day. You are welcome to your opinion. I am welcome to mine as well. I rarely ever name a style or organization in a negative way. However, what the ATA does should be criminal. They produce inferior self-defense and hide it by isolating their group from other TKD styles. You never see ATA black belts at tournaments open to any style of TKD. ATA does a good job of brain washing their members.  A little research on the subject will turn up a number of very unhappy former ATA members that are telling the real story of what goes on behind the scene.  As I said I rarely ever call out an organization. In this case I feel the responsibility of calling the ATA what it is.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	ATA is nothing but one big belt factory. You may want to consider changing schools.    I don't recommend trying to learn martial arts from the internet.|`|hBLNIlYGaa	don't be ridiculous...even mcdojo's arent THAT BAD.|`|WlQzHPwPaa	I range myself with the others ATA is a disgrace to Taekwon-do and martial arts in general.    Find a better school and you might realized that everything you've learned from there is... not much.|`|hBlaUGf1aa	Your instructor should have one, mine did and gave me a copy as soon as I got my black belt because he knows that I use it to reinforce my form but not learn it. If you still do not have it, I will look for my copy and post it later. Don't listen to all the haters there might be some ATA schools that are "belt factories" but there are some in every style. The ATA is a big organization so it has a large target on its back for people to attack. I love the ATA and am in the process of starting my own school. Congratulations on the black belt, it is just the beginning. Good Luck!! :)

PBBkky3Faa	Well in England Female Professional footballers (playing in the league and national club) earn between 2,500/4,000 per week ($3700/$5920 U.S Dollars per week.)  BUT If you play in the lower league teams it is abit less.   Female football do NOT get enough money, and i am hoping after 2012 that Female Professional footballing is more popular and we will be able to get more money, because if you don't make it into the best clubs you will need another job so you have enough money to pay all the bills and your health insurance.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	around 50'00 a year.|`|tXKLN473aa	I am pretty sure that female soccer players get payed about $120,000 a year!!

Women's Soccer is   now Professional in America, they can earn about the same as  league one/championship men's teams in England (depending on the team you will play for and the type of player you are) But i think that's about the average.    I would suggest trying to get into a premiership Women's youth club in England before trying to crack America, The more history you have with a winning team the bigger the chance of you getting a scholarship    Women players in england (for premiership and england level) earn $250,000 a year. If that helps. But that is for only very high level footballers... Kelly Smith, Faye White & Rachel Yankey.       Good luck hope you make America!!  Go for it!  Any other questions email me

DDmFQU7raa	Defense.    People have an easier time scoring than they do playing defense.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	depends on what you mean, if you are a one man press, can sense the offenses next move, can stick to a guy driving to the basket, block shots, and get steals then defense may be more difficult to develop as it requires raw athleticism.     If you are just talking about aggressive defense in a half-court style of play, then offense more difficult to develop.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Offense!    But whats more affective?

When you fall backward punch the snow and sit on your butt. A broken wrist is the most common beginner injury when learning to snowboard.    Learning to push (skate) on your snowboard is very important because you need this skill to get to and from the lift. Force yourself to push (skate) from behind your heel edge, taking short steps, as this will make your snowboard glide much better.|`|HkwUGOmxaa	Here are a few tips. If you are worried about getting hurt then wear a helmet. Wear those base layers that have pads sewn in. They go under your clothes and nobody will see them. Get lessons. At least once. The things you learn there will stick with you forever. Do NOT stand up straight. THis will make it further for you to fall. Stay low on yoyr board with your knees bent. This will lower your center of gravity and make it easier for you to turn. This is very important. Wtire it on your hand. Stay low with your knees bent. O.K? Plus it will allow you to fall with less impact and roll imto a ball. If you fall....relax. Go with the flow. It is better to be relaxed. Being stiff and tense may make it worse. Eat a lot for energy. Drink a lot of water for your muscles. Dont let anyone talk you into going somewhere you are not comfortable with riding. Hopefully your friends are cheering you on as you go...I find doing this back and forthe makes the day fun and builds your confidence. Do NOT let your friends psyche you out. Often they can make fun of you for falling...not good friends unless its just a little laugh. If someone says,"Ihavent fallen all day!" Then tell them they arent pushing themselves like you are to learn more. Ask them why they arent trying to learn more(this has always been one of the things I dislike the most). And lastly the word confidence...time. The more you go, the more turns you take, the more times you have gone down that one run....just makes it that much easier the next time.|`|7otyLHwCaa	Avoid snowboarding with friends who will make fun of you for sucking...you'll get embarrassed and pissed off and it will suck.

HkwUGOmxaa	yeah. shouldnt be a problem. You amy make some adjustments to your straps but they will be easy. 32 doesnt make a binding so they would hope that there top selling boot would fit into one of the top selling bindings right? You shouldnt have a worry. Bring the board to the shop so that they can help you with any adjustments and you wont have to deal with it on your own or in the morning on the hill. I have worked in the snowboard indusrty for 8 years and riding for 16. I have never noticed a problem with that combination of gear.
