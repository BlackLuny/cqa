20080929045131AAAO4YF	Sports;Football (Australian);Australian Rules	Which state does Hawthorn come from?	I thought both Geelong and Hawthorn came from Melbourne, then I saw a Hawthorn shirt with Tasmania written on it. And I know they are going to Tasmania to see their fans. Then I read something saying Tasmania was looking for a permanent team - and the Hawks were going over there to tell them to let it go, and they were only going to be based there until 2010 - 2011. Ha ha - I am so confused!      So know I'm thinking they come from Tasmania.. even though before the grand final I was certain they were from Melbourne. Anyway my question is... Do the Hawks play for Melbourne or Tas??      And congrats to them for winning the final.. I am a Crows supporter but out of Geelong and the Hawks I was going for Geelong - shattered they lost =[ Oh well - I guess the Hawks must have been playing really well (I didn't get a chance to see the game).       But yeah, thanks for any answers and sorry I wrote so much above..! =]

Earnest Graham (vs Seattle)-one of the worst rushing defenses in the league and an automatic TD but will he get yards??? Is Warwick Dunn handcuffed to this guy?      Thomas Jones (@Oak)- another poor rushing defense which looks like another big game for Jones or will Brett Favre limit him so the pass can be the show stopper.      Marshawn Lynch (vs SD)- I find high risk with him he hasn't scored a 100 yard game yet and I doubt its going to happen against the Chargers, I"m not sure how the bye week will affect him b/c before the bye he had a horrible performance.      L.T.(@Buf)-Yes I would be pissed if he ended up breaking through while he was on my bench but I lost the trust in him and the 1 win I got was from benching him. How will the whole eat and west coast traveling affect him?      I'm 1 and 5 and If sitting my studs gets me the win I'm taking it because this will be the deciding factor of win or lose.

QB David Garrard (@DET)   QB Phillip Rivers (KC)   (one QB spot)      RB Ronnie Brown (SEA)   RB Chris Johnson (@CHI)   RB Matt Forte (TEN)   RB Maurice Jones-Drew (@DET)      Two Running Backs and one RB/WR spot      WR Plaxico Burress (@PHI)   WR Hines Ward (IND)   WR DeSean Jackson (NYG)   Two Wide Receivers and still one RB/WR spot...      i was definitely thinking to bench Jackson because he's playing a tough Giants defense. I was also thinking that i would then start two runningbacks and have one of them as my RB/WR... And I also think that I am the only person that does not think that Chris Johnson is amazing! He's showed in previous weeks that he only has big games against weak defenses and this week he's playing a nasty Chicago defense. The two quarterbakcs i wanted to start are both playing very weak defenses and Phillip Rivers is coming off of a bye.  Who do you think I should start at each position?

20081129061648AAZZwvc	Sports;Football (Soccer);French Football (Soccer)	Cedric Carrasso est-il meilleur que Mandanda ?	Ma réponse est OUI, sans aucune hésitation... (celui qui dit le contraire il conna?t pas le football)   Je pense que les marseillais ont eu tort de lacher cedric qui fait un excellent début de saison, à mesure que mondada régresse et dévoile son vrai niveau au grand jour...      Mondada, je l'ai toujours dit : il est nul, e basta      Lloris pareil..      Pour élargir le débat, le gardien de l'équipe de farce en 2010, c'est Pelé (s'il part dans un grand club l'année prochaine, par exemple en italie) ou Carrasso (s'il part dans un grand club aussi, ou s'il revient à marseille .... notez que je fais la différence entre "marseille" et "grand club")...         Demain, en tout cas, belle opposition de style entre un carrasso qui retrouve des couleurs et qui aura à coeur de confirmer face à ses anciennes couleurs ... et un Mondada très fébrile ces dernières semaines (peu aidé, je l'avoue, par sa défense pitoyable).

I want to show her because she has come such a long way, and I want to prove to everyone that just because she has a disorder doesn't mean she's a bad horse. She is a fantastic horse. The only problem is when she was given to me, they said she was registered. Come to find out, her papers are fake. What do I do? Like, the papers are lost now because the previous owner lost them, but said it didn't matter because she was the one that said she had fake papers. So, so much for showing her....right?

20090309200116AAyunXD	Sports;Basketball	Who else agrees on this one?	Alright I really dont care now. Wade should be MVP. He is in the same boat Kobe was when Shaq left and he got snubbed. I know this wont happen but many would say yes.

Maybe it's just me but I think NBA stars are steeping up on the 3 point shots.

Like I've always said, MVP is not about your teams record, its about the most valuable player, and no one is more valuable to his team then Wade.       Laker fans defended Kobe.    Cavs fans (including myself) defended LeBron last year.       But this year, no doubt its Wade.

20090309185250AAwdzkf	Sports;Football (American)	UFL affects on the NFL?	So, i'm more or less concerned about an announcement made by the organization referred to as the "UFL" .   The UFL believe it or not, is actually real:    http://www.ufl-football.com/home     ... despite years of speculation of any actually football organization existing.   Now, who cares, yadda yadda, football organizations come, go, and co-exist with the NFL (XFL, arena football, etc).  But, in statements on their website they continually mention "recognizable players & coaches from the NCAA and NFL" .  They've announced July 1st as a "signing date for players" .   They've announced a single location for training camp, etc.  It really just all sounds like a terrible idea.   But, here's my point.  If you take a second to look at the website, does it seem to anyone else their intentions are to lure players from the NFL?  I couldn't imagine investors actually having invested enough money to do such a thing.  But, if you look at it, in July there could be some big named players not yet under contract in the NFL.  Jeff Garcia, Marvin Harrison, and more than half of the 250+ players in the draft.  Granted, the NFL could really do without these players.  But, outside negotiations could be catastrophic for the NFL.   Signing any player is like buying a new car.  You tell them you want $30m, they say they'll give you $15m.  Eventually, players and teams meet in the middle at a happy median.  But, observe this scenario:   Matt Ryan, 3rd overall pick, 2008 NFL Draft   signed to a 6yr. $72m contract   _____________ This scenario is only hypothetical.  Ryan was dealt with and signed this contract less than a month after the draft.   --Imagine.  What if Atlanta actually had a quarterback?  What if Atlanta had a Bret Favre, Peyton Manning, or Tom Brady?  What if that franchise quarterback was in a say his 12th or 13th season.  Atlanta was just looking ahead.     -- At the same time, Atlanta has drafted this young QB of the future.  He could be the face of the franchise if the starter went down, in a few years maybe.  What if "Tom Manning" decided to play another 4 years?  That means Ryan becomes the "Sorgi" of Atlanta.   --  Here's my point.  During negotations, with all this running through the mind of this young, 23-year-old future superstar, what if a 3rd party phoned it.  "Hi, it's the UFL.  Matt, we have a proposition for you.  Our newly formed Las Vegas Thunder Weasels would like to offer you a 4yr. $52m contract.  AND, an opportunity to be the face of our organization.  A modern day Red Grange, if you will..."   My point is, what type of affect would this organization have on the NFL?

The Blazers are an up and coming team, they play very well at home and they probably do the Lakers in again. I'm a Lakers fan, I know it's very tough for the Lakers to pull out a win tonight because Portland is a tough team at home. The Lakers blow out Portland twice already at  Los Angeles but to get a win in Portland tonight, the Lakers have to bring their A game or it's another loss at Portland. How did the bookmakers have Portland a 2.5 underdog at home, they have the Lakers number at home, 12 of the last 14 games anyway. What your thought on tonight match up? I think it's a close game either way. So, who you got, Lakers or Blazers?
20090309193604AA6ZEAc	Sports;Basketball	Who's the MVP this year?	Who you got as your MVP on your worthless ballot? All I know who the medias want as their MVP, it's King James of course. The Medias want the MVP for King without a crown James. But, LeBron does have merit for MVP this year, but James haven't won a big games this year when it matter most. He loss twice to Kobe and he recently loss to a Boston team without KG in the line up...........hmmmm it just doesn't sound right. MVP got to come up big in BIG games. So Kobe is the MVP this year, his team have the best record in the NBA and he's winning big games against Boston twice and Cavs twice. Your thought on the MVP please?

I heard somewhere that using treats as a reward will cause dogs to only be obedient when they see a treat. This dog needs to be obedient and allow everyone to have fun. Also if you can give me other advice as far as making him point on sight of a bird. His parents both were hunters and he shows potential. So far he knows how to sit, stay, come, and lay down but he does not do it without a treat. This is also my first dog and i am training him myself. I am 15 years old.

20090309203453AAdrZRx	Sports;Horse Racing	How do I train my horse?	My husband has just bought me a beautiful (but neglected) 4yo 16hh QH mix. I have loved this horse ever since I met her 2 years ago so when the owners let her get super skinny, they were willing to part with her. I do not know much about horse training at all. I started with the basics of building a bond with her. I have her on a regular feeding schedule of 1 1/2 cups high fat grain in the morning, turned out from 3-6, then another 1 1/2 cups grain when I put her back in her field. It took about a week, but now she will come to me when she sees the harness and does not move so I can put it on her. For about 30 minutes a day I take her on our dirt road and walk her. For the most part she does fine and is not spooked by cars, but every once in a while she gives me trouble. Today she she fought me the whole walk and even tried to run off. I know she wanted to get back to her pasture so I kept making her "whoa" and everytime she would try and walk without me leading her, I would turn her in a circle and make her "whoa" again. Then when we got to her pasture I made her "whoa" for about 3 minutes before letting her off the lead. Am I doing things right? Shouldn't it be getting easier by now since I have been doing this for about 5 weeks?    Also, our relationship started with her trying to nip me a few times a day and now she only tries once in the morning when I feed her. If I go to pet her she tries to nip me, I pull her head away from the grain while telling her no, then I let her eat again and she doesn't try to nip and allows me to pet her. Am I doing something (everything) wrong? My hope is to eventually ride her one day, but I see a LONG road ahead if I can't even keep her even tempered while on a lead.   Vet gave the a-okay, she is gaining weight, farrier did his thing (no shoes since she is not ridden).   Thanks, sorry for the long post.

This means the second half is not a factor at all. Lakers had 100% more foul calls on them by early in the third. The game is over at this point, no Laker can defend or they will foul out. There just way too many calls not made.      Kobe shot his first free throw 8 minutes into the fourth. That has never happened.      Refs start calling pointless fouls at the end of the third and fourth when it won't matter. They did their damage early.      The flagrant on Ariza was a joke at best.

20090309224237AAEuaoB	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	Spain's 2016 Olympics and 2018 World Cup bid harmed by racism?	Well what do you think Spain? Are you guys ready for all the different type of ethnic groups and races to come to your country without giving monkey chants and pulling your eyes back to look Chinese. I feel you guys are not ready for any of the events and none should be hosted in spain.. And i know most of your spaniards will come on here and say Oh spain is not racist, they were just having fun like you usually do so dont even to there.. I thought spain was a pretty bright and educated country but i'm think i may be wrong as spain is still living in the hitler time period or something..      MADRID (AP) -- Spain is a serious contender to host the 2016 Olympics and 2018 World Cup, but a failure to clamp down on fans' racist and extremist behavior could end up compromising both bids.      Buoyed by Rafael Nadal's Grand Slam tennis wins, the national football team's European Championship triumph and Alberto Contador's sweep of cycling's three premier events, Spain is in a golden age of sports.      It would seem the perfect time to land the two biggest sporting spectacles on earth.      But scenes of offensive fan behavior still tarnish the country's image, an issue that came to the fore when spectators at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium greeted England's black football players with monkey chants during a friendly in 2004.      And the problem extends to sports such as Formula One, where fans don't known when to differentiate between competitive spirit and racism.      "In Spain, there is a profound problem and the fight against racism hasn't been taken seriously. The problem is a lack of education and sensibility when it comes to tackling racism," Esteban Ibarra, head of the Movement Against Intolerance, told The Associated Press.      "The public would react positively to a campaign, but there is a real lack of political push in this fight."      Spain's friendly against England on Wednesday — the teams' first meeting since the events in the Spanish capital in November 2004 — comes at a crucial time.      It's a day before Madrid submits its documents to the International Olympic Committee outlining its bid plans for the 2016 Games, and a little over a week after Spain confirmed its joint bid with Portugal for the 2018 World Cup.      "It's going to be a great test to see if we've overcome that episode or if we're just continuing on with this problem," said Ibarra, who has been charting racial incidents for 20 years.      Monkey chants still rain down on players across the country, with Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon nearly quitting a game at Zaragoza in February 2006 because of the abuse.      "When I first experienced it, I didn't even hear it. It was reporters that brought it to my attention," said Julian De Guzman, a Canadian of Filipino-Jamaican heritage who plays for Deportivo La Coruna. "Then I was watching (a replay of) the game and I was like 'Wow.' It was pretty surprising and kind of disappointing.      "The fines are never enough. They're just a slap of the hand and they're back at it again. It doesn't really do anything."      Last month, Real Madrid was fined 3,000 euros ($3,900) after some fans displayed fascist banners, made gestures and chanted slogans with reference to the death of their opponents and the gas chamber.      The Spanish football federation said fines correspond to current laws, but preferred not to discuss the issue at length.      "In Spain, we take all preventive measures possible to fight racism," spokesman Jorge Carretero said. "I don't see any type of problem with racism in Spanish football. The same problems exist in England, in Germany, in France, and elsewhere."      Spain's bid with Portugal for the 2018 World Cup is up against competition from England, the United States, Russia, Japan, Australia and Netherlands-Belgium, among others. The host will be selected by FIFA in December 2010.      "There is no place in football for corruption and racism," FIFA said in a statement sent to the AP. "Football, given its global reach, power and influence has a duty to act in a responsible and progressive manner."      Spanish Olympic Committee president Alejandro Blanco doesn't believe recent events will bear any influence on Madrid's chances of hosting the 2016 Games, with Tokyo, Chicago and Rio de Janeiro also in the race. The IOC will choose the host city on Oct. 2.      "These things can happen in any stadium in any country in the world, from Brazil to Italy to anywhere," Blanco said. "It's too easy to just say that Spain is a racist country, when it is not."      The Spanish government passed a law against racism in sport in July 2007 in a bid to clamp down on the behavior, but experts say that it is not being used. Clubs can be fined up to $842,000 and deducted points, places and even relegated for serious incidents, but it's up to the league to enforce such punishments.

20090309220103AANqDiP	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Other - Outdoor Recreation	I have a Pellet Gun. Any Scope Suggestions?	I was wondering if any of you were really knowledgable about scopes and stuff for a pellet gun. I have a Gamo Big Cat 1200. It is .177 caliber and shoots 1000fps with lead. It is a break barrel. Any way I was wondering if any of you guys had some scope suggestions for me. The scope it came with (some gamo scope that is 4x32) is really crappy. I am going to shoot at small game such as rats, pigeons, sparrows, sea gulls, squirrels, rabbits, etc. The range I am going to mostly shoot at is up to 75 yards. Does anyone have any scope suggestions for what I'm gonna do witht the gun? Also my budget is $100. I would prefer if it were under 75$ though :D. I have been looking online and I found a scope that I want to buy. Is this a good one? Also is there anything wrong with remanufactured?       http://www.airgundepot.com/centerpoint-a... 
20090309220330AAFeA3k	Sports;Basketball	If you were even a just a basketball player, how would you consider the foul on you?	LA vs. Blazers      Ariza fouled Rudy hard.    If you were playing a normal Bball and someone smacks you at the back of the head and you fall bad on the ground and cant feel nothing, would you consider that being BABISH?      C'mon people, if you even sprain your ankle, you go to see the doctor. Rudy fell real bad and when he got help, after lying on the ground for 15 mins, these hypocrites call him being faking too much.      I bet not even one player would be able to walk off after that fall...      People, be realistic, just because your team's member fouls hard somebody doesn't mean it was CLEAN.      What are your thoughts? Only open minded and unbiased answers please. No haters or distractions.

20090309230614AAojSqp	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Is this worth buying?	My friend is selling a mosin nagent and he offered to sell me the rifle, 34 rounds of ammo, the cleaning kit, and few other things for $100. I believe its the m44 or the smaller version but some of these look huge and this wasnt quite so big. The only problem is the stock has been stained over and doesnt look quite right plus im not sure how much the guns been used or how the barrel really looks (didnt get a good look). But i mainly wanted this rifle to play around with, possibily deer hunt with it in the future as a starter rifle and if i get into it more buy a nicer rifle. But considering that ive never owned anything besides 2 .22 rifles i wanted something bigger and this looks like the cheapest thing i can find for the $200 i have. I just wants to know if this sounds like a good deal? and if i want to add a scope, bipod, and new stock later how much would that cost? I really just want to get into collecting guns that why im so immpatient.       Also are is ammo easy to find for this rifle and how much does it cost?
