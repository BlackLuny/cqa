20070124043217AATDVZj	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone used Andis dog grooming clippers before?	I've been researching dog clippers...was wondering if anyone else has used this brand and if they're happy with them. I'd be using them on a cocker spaniel. I don't want to pay out a reasonable sum of money only to find out they're useless and keep them in the cupboard. Any info would be appreciated.

Considere os tempos de hoje, em que precisamos ser o melhor para podermos ser bom no mercado de trabalho, além das inúmeras tarefas que enfrentamos no dia-a-dia. Será que ter um c?o n?o seria alguma lacuna emocional que o proprietário pretende preencher? Será que vale a pena ter que limpar o xixi, o coco, dar banho semanalmente, dar comida todos os dias, trazer do supermercado aquele pacot?o de ra??o, levar para o veterinário quando adoece, pagar um nota preta pelo tratamento, limpar os pelos que caem na casa, trancá-los quando chega uma visita quando se trata de um cachorro de guarda, etc, etc, etc e  dinheiro para mantê-lo?
20070204132922AAHcYHc	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog whine only for this reason?	When my husband and I walk our dog. I notice that if he leaves to go in the store and she is waiting with me, she wimpers and whines for him. When her and I are alone she is great. But when she is around both of us at times, she acts up. I am in obedience training with her-so she listens to me, but when it comes to him leaving for a few minutes, for example-grocery store or walks ahead of us she tries to follow him..need some explatation. Thanks

20070307131612AAAzHLH	Pets;Dogs	Dog's Rotting Tooth??	I've just been told that my dog has one bad tooth, up the top at the left. I'm bemused by this, because his teeth look to be in healthy order at the front, and he has always had a good quality diet, and is never allowed to eat crap. In fairness, I've never actually brushed his teeth, because I didn't think I had to during the first year (because they lose their teeth anyway)...can someone shed some light on this!? Is it a sign of something more sinister?! Or is it usual to have one rotten tooth and for the others to be fine!?      He is 12 months old and is a German Shepherd.

I know she retained at least 1 placenta but the vet gave her a Oxytoxin shot.  She however did eat the rest of placenta's which I know can give her diarrhea but given the fact she had them in the middle of the night I had no help and wasn't given any other choice.  Her temp is 101.5 and she still has a healthy appetite.  So is the fact she ate to many placentas making her sick and how long will this last?  Or is there something else I need to worry about.

I tried to brush them softly today with a doggy toothbrush and tooth paste (7years old!) but her gums started bleeding.  The  vet wants us to take her in for 150$ and have her mouth cleaned.

20070503043201AAnevl7	Pets;Cats	Any experience with cats and raised blood glucose levels?	My 14 1/2 year old neutered male cat had to go to the vets to get his teeth scaled.  It's quite a long journey but doesn't usually bother him, so I was surprised he was shouting all the way - though realised why when he pooed himself (he'd obviously not had time for his usual morning outing before we had to leave).  When I collected him, they said his blood glucose levels (which they check along with other things before giving anaesthetic) were very high, and although this can happen with stress, they said the level was even higher than they would expect with that.  They suggested it could be diabetes and wanted me to let them have a urine sample from him.  To do this I would have to shut him in a small room overnight which would stress him thoroughly (we live in a rural area where he's used to hunting - and likes to sleep on top of me when he's in overnight!).  Is there a real risk?  I am almost certain the problem was entirely stress-related.  What would you advise?

20090202124107AAlzvfM	Pets;Dogs	Potentially aggressive, how do I socialize?	I have a 7 month old shih tzu mix. I walk her 30 minutes twice a day around the neighborhood. I don't have a car and my neighborhood is in the middle of no where. She doesn't get too much interaction with people or animals. She is scared of people and backs away when they try to pet her but after a few tries she realizes they just want to pet her. I've had her since 5 months old. In those two months this is how meeting other dogs has gone.     Toy poodle - had no interest, wanted to smell the grass not meet the dog.     Large chi and lhasa apso - backed away and whined as they approached, (they were off leash roaming) i told my dog "lets go" (my command for this is a walk so start walking), she started to walk and then wanted to go meet the dogs but they walked away.    large golden and large gsd - friendly dogs approached her to say hi, when they put their heads down to sniff her my dog freaked out growling making noises like she was attacking something. she did not have her mouth on the dogs or try to bite them.         im worried my dog will be aggressive when meeting other dogs. those two dogs were HUGE and probably just scared her. i try to take her to the marina where people walk and walk with their dogs but what should i do if she does that again? or what if she does that and the other dog thinks its being attacked and attacks back and a real fight breaks out? should i yank her back or yank her up and hold her? im just confused at what to do if my dog is aggressive when meeting another dog. im not sure if she will react the same from now on or more frequently but i dont want to stop taking her out in public.

20090202125358AAKjudV	Pets;Dogs	Should my neighbor be so mad at me because my dog chased her cat?	I let my dog go out to the bathroom on my lunch break today and she chased my neighbor's cat up a tree. She has done this once before, but I thought we had the problem mended because I've been offering her treats for a successful return from potty. She was very responsive to this. She is a fairly new dog and still pretty young. I see dogs going outside to go to the bathroom all the time and thought she could do the same with a little encouragement. The owner of the cat is really mad, but then again, her cat was running around outside so I kind of think the laws of nature apply here. I will start taking my dog out on a leash since she's proven she has an issue with cats, but should my neighbor really be this angry when it's only happened one time with her cat? I think I am a pretty good dog owner, but this woman is acting like I'm horrible.

My cat has always been really choosy when it comes to food - but recently she has really cut down on what she eats - & has been drinking water like its going out of fashion!!  I am worried that she may be diabetic.  I can't really afford the vets but if its really necessary then i will find the money.  She is quite an old cat.  I got her from the RSPCA about 8 years ago & she has always been a cat (rather than a kitten) the RSPCA didn't know her age so i am guessing about 10 human years old.    Is this normal behavior?

20081019005431AATDpaY	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog not like going outside anymore?	She use to love to go out on her own and play for awhile, sometimes up to a few hours. We keep water out there for her and she likes running around and acting in ways that she isn't allowed to inside. Recently she has "asked" to go out less, and spends less time outside when she does go out. I like her having her own time, and having plenty of opportunity to do her business. I'm wondering if it is because it is cooling off. She is only 10 months old and it has been warm for most of the time we've had her. We live in Texas, so it never gets that cold, but it is much chillier. Do you think if we gave her a doggie sweater or coat that she would want to go out more?   She has fairly short hair, here is a picture:  http://s184.photobucket.com/albums/x187/...

Watching his face is like watching a person. I can usually know what he's feeling and his next action almost always proves my thoughts right.      I watch other dogs all the time, and their faces feel... blank. I have to watch more of their body language. And I also feel like their emotions are plain... like excitement when I play with them, disappointment when I turn away, and a basic want. I feel like my beagle is much more complex.      Am I just looking too far into my familiar dog? Or is he really unique?

20061027052900AAHOSRL	Pets;Dogs	Natural bones to chew on for dogs?	My dobie is allergic to a lot of different meat.  She's on a venison formula dog food and is doing wonderful.  So this question is about bones.  She loves chewing on them and I was wondering if there would be any problems/concerns if I got some deer bones from a friend (who is going hunting this weekend) to let her chew on?  Should I roast them in the oven to kill anything that may be in there?  They would be extremely fresh, maybe a day old.  Or should I leave them raw?  The only problem with that would be how messy and stinky it is.  She can't eat beef, so don't suggest I go buy some of those, and she already has pig/lamb bones.  I just didn't see the point in these being thrown away if they could be used.  I would take the femur bone.  Any suggestions as to precautions or how to prepare it for her?

20061030084858AAV49dB	Pets;Fish	Wieviel Stunden t?glich filtern bzw. wie schnell sterben die Bakterienkulturen?	Wieviele Stunden kann ein kleiner Innenfilter im 54l Aquarium abgestellt sein, bevor die Bakterienst?mme sterben? Sterben Sie überhaupt? Mangels Nahrung?      Irgendwo im Netz habe ich gelesen nach einer Stunde würden die Bakterien eingehen, in einem Fachbuch was von mehreren Tagen gelesen (Einstellen der Filterung bei Medikamentenzugabe).      Was stimmt denn wirklich?      Mein Zooh?ndler ist der Ansicht, ich vergifte meine Fische, wenn ich den Filter nachts nicht durchlaufen lasse :-( ???

20070113211227AAmVgkM	Pets;Dogs	What type of breed would be best for me? Description of the breed inside...?	Ok these are the characteristics that I want in a dog:      ~Loving   ~Affectionate   ~Good with children   ~Semi-good guard dog   ~Playful   ~Energetic (needs atleast 2 walks per day)   ~Must be good with cats   ~Easy to train   ~Doesn't need too much grooming (no more than a few brushes per week)   ~Smart/intelligent   ~Good with strangers (not reserved)   ~Not too many herediary health problems (no more than 5 known hereditary health problems)      I have researched a couple breeds but I can't decide what dog would be best for me. I don't mind what size it is but NO CHIHUAHUAS, YORKIES, MALTESE OR SHIH-TZU! I really don't like those breeds so DO NOT SUGGEST THEM! I don't want a dog that is known for being aggressive and I don't want a dog that would require a dominating or experienced owner. I've only ever owned a Dalmatian so I don't have any experience with a dominating breed.   Any suggestions would be great. I'm at a loss of what breed to get! I don't want to make a bad decision.
