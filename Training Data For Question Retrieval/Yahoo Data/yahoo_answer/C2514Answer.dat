FmAse7pUaa	Nationalism is the idea that one owes everything to their country and that loyalty to ones country is the top priority, therefore a nationalist is someone who believes in nationalism. Internal dissenters are people who strive to create civil unrest via revolts etc. Imperialism takes a very long time to explain but to sum it up it is when one country takes or creates other countries and has them serve as colonies. An example is Britain was an imperial nation as it had the colonies in India, Australia, and North America.

xG5ZlJDqaa	1) Feels really average. In general, when taking pictures of scenery, the horizon shouldn't be right in the middle. Furthermore, all the interest is on the background; a good picture includes elements from the foreground as well as the background. In your case, a passerby or a cyclist would do just fine. Colour feels off, whether you did it intentionally or not, and the picture just feels really soft overall. 5/10    2) Okay... a lot of clutter on the left side, and nothing on the right. Why don't you just move the camera a little to the left more? The sky isn't really eye-catching and worthy to take up such a huge part of the picture. I appreciate the black and white, but more contrast would make it more dynamic. Feels inferior and lacking overall. 5/10    3) Hmm.. not really impressive. The picture feels "washed out" and is lacking any real detail or contrast. Many parts of the picture is blown out. This is usually caused from pointing the camera lens at or near the sun, causing it to "ghost". I like the squirrel's pose, but the picture can be further improved by zooming in a little more, or move in a little closer to get the shot. A tip for shooting small animals is to shoot at eye level, this makes the picture far more engaging than shooting it from top to down. 5.5/10    4) Interesting shapes, bad technique and composition. The picture is obviously really blurry. In low light conditions when the shutter speed dips below 1/15th of a second, it is recommended that you use a tripod, unless your camera features an optical image stabilizer. The composition can be improved by moving the camera to left and up a tiny bit. Again, a little more contrast would be welcome. 6.5/10.    5)  A good attempt. There's too much dark spots in the frame however, and the lens is too zoomed out, making the lights appearing nothing more than tiny, insignificant specks. The shot can be improved by zooming in, removing the majority of the dark spots in the frame. 7/10    well I dont have that much time to critique on each picture, but all I can say is to keep on trying. dont give up =)|`|r8kzISoyaa	its just an okay pics..not to goo but i wont say bad coz its rude to say that word.pics are fine..you should have a good camera for that camera helps alot Buddie if you like check this photographs  its might help you..  http://leipre.devian okay hope you do visit for you to learn some..take care|`|X6koEo6iaa	i like 7 and 8 the best|`|sKvIgiN4aa	there all horrible|`|aNlT1NRqaa	They're not bad attempts, but you still need practice. The biggest problem is camera shake (time to get a good tripod) and composition, but that is where practice & critiques like this come in.    You do seem to have an eye for subject, you just need to learn how to frame the shot.    Don't quit.

sdHt5hjTaa	There are so many different kinds of modeling, but most people only think of those creepy skeletons on the runways of Paris.  Try researching these avenues:    Fit model--models that represent an exact size in their measurements, like a perfect size 4 or 8 or even 14. Desired by clothing designers to see how their creations 'wear'.    Parts model--models who have exceptional parts, like perfect hands for a ring or nail polish model, or pretty ears for earrings, or pouty lips for glosses.    Print model--models who appear in magazine ads.  There is a wide variety here, everything from promoting a product to appearing in a sears catalog.  You may even find work as a product model for your local hardware store.    Just don't be sucked in by those 'modeling schools' that want to charge you like $500 to join.  Do the research and get with a reputable agency.    Cool tip:  you can get cheap or even free head shots if you live near a college.  Find a photography student and ask if they could take a couple of photos of you in exchange for you letting them use the photos for their own portfolio.    Also check out onemodelplace.com    :)|`|hxienw1Xaa	Umm maybe you should post a picture, But go for it modeling leads to many good thing. Short people are pimped anyway good luck! XOXO
90zIsbWWaa	Many people didn't know about it until it was too late as most of it was done under the cover of the second world war.  after the war many Nazis were tried at the Nuremberg trials.|`|x15ek422aa	Who knew about the killings?  Some claim that the full extent of what was happening in German-controlled areas was not known until after the war. However, numerous rumors and eyewitness accounts from escapees and others gave some indication that Jews were being killed in large numbers. Since the early years of the war the Polish government-in-exile published documents and organised meetings to spread word of the fate of the Jews. By early 1941, the British had received information via an intercepted Chilean memo that Jews were being targeted, and by late 1941 they had intercepted information about a number of large massacres of Jews conducted by German police. In the summer of 1942 a Jewish labor organization (the Bund) got word to London that 700,000 Polish Jews had already died, and the BBC took the story seriously, though the United States State Department did not take the news seriously. By the end of 1942, however, the evidence of the Holocaust had become clear and on December 17, 1942 the Allies issued a statement that the Jews were being transported to Poland and killed. The US State Department was aware of the use and the location of the gas chambers of extermination camps, but refused pleas to bomb them out of operation. On May 12, 1943, Polish government-in-exile and Bund leader Szmul Zygielbojm committed suicide in London to protest the inaction of the world with regard to the Holocaust, stating in part in his suicide letter:  I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being killed. My comrades in the Warsaw ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle. I was not permitted to fall like them, together with them, but I belong with them, to their mass grave.     By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people.     Debate also continues on how much average Germans knew about the Holocaust. Recent historical work suggests that the majority of Germans knew that Jews were being indiscriminately killed and persecuted, even if they did not know of the specifics of the death camps. Robert Gellately, a historian at Oxford University, conducted a widely-respected survey of the German media before and during the war, concluding that there was "substantial consent and active participation of large numbers of ordinary Germans" in aspects of the Holocaust, and documenting that the sight of columns of slave labourers were common, and that the basics of the concentration camps, if not the extermination camps, were widely known.    First and foremost was to win the war.  The fate of the Jews was second.|`|rh8szekzaa	Most ordinary people didn't know it was happening. Death camps were strategically placed outside of Greater Germany so the public would never get wind of what was really happening. The extent of the mass murder was not even fully known until after the war finished.     I'm sure, considering Hitler was a dictator, that opposing his policies or opinions would have meant death so a lot of his accomplices went along with the plans. A lot of them, such as Goebbels and Himmler, would probably have been brainwashed by Nazi propaganda also. The Nazi propaganda techniques were very convincing. It is easy to understand why people would have followed Hitler without question.    People were put on trial for ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Nuremberg.    You should give best answer to M R. That answer was awesome.
1hvrQYWiaa	Anthropology covers the study of human beings at all times and in all places,so an anthropological study would be a study of a certain group of people, be it a village or a whole culture, at a given time in a given place and relating this to other similar studies of other, or the same peoples in other,or the same, places at other times.    Ethnography is academic writing that describes a human society.It is based on fieldwork (for example, archaeology), and is usually descriptive rather than analytical.    'Straphical' doesn't appear to be a word, so, sorry, can't help you with that one

9HCypvHJaa	I don't think so, because with amnesia you only forget things from within the recent past (it can be days, months, or years).

7igxiGrAaa	It may still be too soon to tell what they are worth. I'm sure if you held onto them for awhile they would go up in value.    If you are a registered Ebay member, you can also search through the completed listings. It is an option on the left hand navigation bar.

An inspirational line, a moment of time, events  or some other part of the book should be the title.  Names are different.

Then begin the story.    Come up with a story first, a plot. Something to happen.    Then, create characters. When I do this, I like to follow this guide to help me: http://www.chimerapulsestudio.com/Chimer... It's extremely useful.    Name based on country of birth and time period. If a character was born in America in the 1800's, it'd be smart to pick out names popular then. If the man was born in Germany in the 1980's BUT was named after his great grandfather, you'd have to go back to the time his Great-Grandfather was born and pick a popular name or a name with meaning, or if the parents were creative, one rarely used or something.    I enjoy the names:  Male:  Cecil  Lucifer  Godwin  Boone  Clayne  Trawick  James  Christopher  Alexander  Preston    Female:  Cecilia  Madison  Makayla  Barbara  Allison  Jamie  Martha  Jackelyn|`|ZurXsQq4aa	Either way, whatever works best for you at the time.

Characters are the soul of the book - so giving them names and realistic personalities before starting the story is key. Good luck :)

YUaMtlnxaa	To me "live in your moonlight" sounds too much like dwell in the darkness, and I really hope that isn't what you meant. What I got out of it was, embrace who you are when alone and let the real you shine through; by accepting yourself, you allow your eyes to see the truth. For a thirteen year old that is a pretty impressive theme. If that isn't what you were trying to say then I'm sorry for misunderstanding.  As far as skill goes it could use a few rewrites, but you should be able to fix it easy. There are also a few word errors, but other than that it is a pretty good poem and I would definetly encourage you to keep practicing.|`|Eaiat00haa	lovely lovely lovely!! 13??? wow. awesome job.|`|fFt0vWxgaa	it is very good.|`|uG9tuIfFaa	Its really good!

Do you see it?   Do you want to see it?   Can you accept it?  Look for it and let it change the way you live.  Live in your moonlight, who you really are.  And you will see others for the first time.      Your spelling and punctuation was a bit off.    Its pretty good.    The best way to improve your poetry is to read poems by the best,going by your poem maybe you would like D.H Lawrence or Dylan Thomas.    Keep on writing and you will keep on improving,don't be scared to write what you really mean,great writing is what happens when you have no inhibitions.

ZmdIlkpQaa	It provides the characters with their own, distinct, and authentic, voices.  People tend not to speak in standard English, at least most do not, and by using non-standard forms of dialogue, Hinton creates the illusion that her characters are more real, more authentic.|`|LFpcwGwGaa	I think at the time Hinton wrote it, that's how most or some of the people spoke.|`|8494b8cd45b83d10a423c8425c0456edaa	Well, the characters use non-standard English.

(that was sarcasm btw.  the books are bad, the movie is even worse)|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	Well, honestly you can't give much information without spoiling it!

I experienced pain while reading the book.   Head pain.   It was a pain that can only be described as the feeling of your braincells giving up the good fight and shrivelling into nothingness, while screaming,   "Please stop this madness!

GNtWomekaa	Not at all.  It says so in the book and movie that Esme is so happy for Edward that he's finally found someone (Bella). He's been so lonely over his vampire years and she is happy for her son.  Personally, i think Esme likes Edward more than the others, but in a mother way.|`|9HCypvHJaa	Um, NO. That is disgusting, Esme is practically Edward's mother. You and your friends are crazy.    EDIT: Beebrr made a good point- Edward would know if Esme had feelings for him, and he would have put a stop to it.|`|fbrdhY1aaa	Nah.  I do think that Edward is a little twisted though.  Can we say "stalker"?  I love Midnight Sun, but I also think it takes some of the attractive mystery away from Edward's Character.  I'd have liked it better if she'd never written it, but that's just me.|`|XMXlXu0xaa	It's a maternal thing. Edward and Carlisle were together when Carlisle found Esme, so Edward was kind of Esme's first child/son. She had a son that died before she became a vampire. She has a very special place in her heart for Edward. Pretty much any good mother would do ANYTHING to make their son stay. Cant you see what I mean ?|`|QMYNDtHgaa	No, that would be way to interesting for the snooze fest that is twilight.|`|H12d9ctqaa	Um no. I've never even heard of anything about this until now.  Um but that is kind of weird because Esme is for all purposes Edwards mother. Also the love they have for one another is maternal.|`|CoNUK7sKaa	uhhhhh.... no. definitely not. edward would know, and wouldnt let her do that to carlisle. edward is just her favorite son, the one that she worries about the most, she does love him, but she's not IN LOVE with him|`|coQKyWxPaa	I think it is possible that maybe she is somewhat in love with Edward, but I think Edward is forever in love with Bella. He is the most beautiful out of all of them and they aren't far apart in age,so it is totally possible.|`|wxvvERCLaa	No!!!! What in the world would possess you to think that. She's his mom.

EbFvcnUGaa	Facts:* I would suggest learning an acting technique that will help you through any acting problem you will have so that you can overcome it.  *If you are not the method acting type, then you should imagine you are becoming the character. However, you would still need to learn how to do that, so you should still go to an acting school.  Schools I recommend:   1. The Atlantic Acting School (located in NYC and LA)- teaches the William H. Macy and David Mamet technique.  2. HB Studio (located in NYC and LA)  3. Stella Adler (Located in NYC and possibly LA)    Hope that helped. =)|`|1cef74a6cce2ab514140c9166dfc4620aa	what type of acting? theater or film .... email me with you answer if you like.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	Facts: Just slide on the characters' shoes  Schools: None come to mind|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	Two Great Sites!    www.kidsmanagement.com  or  www.actinginfo.blogspot.com    Hope this helps!
Bgqi0pOuaa	Does it have to be Hamlet?  Being a tragedy, you're not going to find much hope there.    The only example I can think of is at the end of one of his soliloquies where he resigns himself to carry out the revenge against his uncle (which he fails to do, of course).  There's something very purposeful in his words, and the reader actually believes he's going to finally act.  You might be able to make a case for hope there, but aside from that, it's the wrong play.    It's the soliloquy that he says after meeting the captain of the army who is marching to Poland to fight for a worthless piece of ground.  Act IV, I believe.

lPxVt2XYaa	Oh dear - it should be pointed out that the Glorious Revolution was not a Marxist Revolution, but a parliamentary one.    The Glorious Revolution was the last act (arguably) of the English Civil War.  The most important legacy was that the power of the Monarchy was limited by Parliament.  This process had been going on since Magna Carta, but the Glorious Revolution was the act that finally put paid to any ideas of absolutism in the UK.  It also settled the religious question, debarring Catholics from the throne.

What I like to do is draw the same type of things i like to draw, just in different ways. I lke to draw angels and anything gothic and or dark. What I do, is if i usually draw an demon with beautful eyes, or something..(HMMMMM) then i draw someone beautiful with empty eyes or evil eyes. See? thats always fun and it helps me feel better. And like the other girl, Music is a great way to draw new things. Some great songs or music to listen to is   -HIM: All his songs are really good for devilish things.  - All That Remains: Same as HIM's. Sound like stories.   -Within Temptation: Again their lyrics sound like stories. Great to draw to.  -Apocalyptica:They're a metal cello band and about half of their songs are with singing and half are just them playing, but all of them are really good to draw to and create art to.  -Seether: They are simply awesome for drawing emotions to.  you could also try to draw a dark angel couple staring off away one looking distressed and the other with anger. Or a demon staring at a girl with longing(Not lust longing but love longing). Or something else like that.  These are the things i like to try. Hope they work for you!

If you like books with storylines based on the use of magic, try books by Trudi Canavan or Andre Norton or even Dennis McKiernan and David Drake.

I found it fascinating - the theories about the nature of time itself, and trails of hidden cryptic clues embedded into the text. Even the identity of the author is concealed somewhere in the book. And although I'm far older than the target audience, I find myself continually being drawn back to it, hoping to discover just one more clue. Few adults books have done that for me recently ... and it's great to find a book that, for once, the entire family can ALL share and talk about; that CERTAINLY hasn't happened since we all read the last Harry Potter!<br>  There's a website if you want more info:<br>  <a href="http://justinthyme.info/" rel="nofollow">http://justinthyme.info/</a><br>  If you want to check out the book on Amazon click here:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Justin-Thyme-Tartan-Panama-Oxridge/dp/0955357004/ref=cm_pdp_profile_reg_itm/203-9915083-6090310?ie=UTF8&coliid=I1C2MIMTSUK3SE&colid=1K4PUKPH24JD8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Justin-Thyme-Tar...</a>|`|45d6058635e517c0c8c7474e112184d1aa	The Diary of Anne Frank<br>  Pollyanna<br>  Little Women<br>  A Room of My Own<br>  Hail, Hail Camp Timberwood<br>  Six Months to Live<br>  No Promises in the Wind<br>  Fifteen<br>  Going on Sixteen<br>  Girl of the Limberlost<br>  Treasure Island<br>  Island of the Blue Dolphins<br>  Joshua <br>  Joshua and the Children<br>  A Gown of Spanish Lace<br>  When Calls the Heart<br>  Enjoy!|`|AA10838603	TEMPLE by Matthew Reilly.

She and her college roommate had traveled to Oregon to take place in a nationwide biking event cross country. Only a few days into their trip while camping in a park, they were assaulted by a cowboy with an axe/hatchet who drove a pickup and parked it on top of Jentz while he attacked her roommate. Both women survived physically but the psychic scars remain. This book recounts the event against the back drop of Jentz's attempts to find out who did the deed. It is an extremely literary account of a brutal attack that typifies the prevailing attitude about violence toward women. She is relentless in her investigation and takes readers along for the painful and poignant journey. We meet interesting, brave and sad people along the way. <br>  <br>  YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!|`|ede57a2f986d909b42c087c97d9fa710aa	I'd recommend anything you can get your hands on by Rodman Philbrick.

En ella se inician nuevas relaciones con los padres y también con el exterior, se produce una ruptura con el mundo infantil. Además los cambios fisiológicos también tienen que integrarse en la vida de los adolescentes de manera que estos puedan adaptarse a su nueva imagen corporal.<br>  adolescentes terapia adolescentes<br>  <br>  No todos los adolescentes viven estos cambios de la misma manera, ya que depende del entorno que tenga cada uno, a parte de las experiencias personales ya vividas anteriormente. Lo que sí está claro es que no se trata de una época fácil, ni para los propios adolescentes, ni para los padres y educadores.<br>  <br>  Los objetivos de esta etapa son bastante generales:<br>  <br>      - Ir adaptándose a su nueva imagen corporal<br>      - Ir definiendo su identidad a partir de nuevas experiencias y nuevos valores que van adquiriendo.<br>      - Integrarse socialmente a medida que se van independizando de sus antiguas relaciones familiares.<br>  <br>  Ir adoptando poco a poco el papel de adultos no es tarea fácil y el papel de los adultos que les rodean es importante, ya que aunque ellos no se sientan muy comprendidos, habrá que evitar que se sientan rechazados.<br>  <br>  Son las relaciones interpersonales, y en concreto las familiares, las que más sufren en esta época. Muchas veces,la búsqueda de independencia entra en conflicto con las normas que los padres les imponen; y ellos se rebelan. Es importante que los padres sepan mantener la calma, aprendan a no ponerse a la altura de los adolescentes en las discusiones y tengan claro que no van a perder a su hijo si son capaces de superar esta etapa con serenidad, aceptando los cambios que sus hijos van sufriendo.<br>  No siempre lo consiguen solos y en ocasiones, necesitan orientación y apoyo tanto los padres como los hijos.

That book provides first-person accounts of the civil rights movement of the 50-60's.      The book lists some amazing people whose names are not as well-known as those you list in your question.  You may also be surprised by some other names as well such as:    Andrew Young  Jesse Jackson  Ralph Abernathy -- one of the key people of the Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC)  Joseph Lowery ( gave the benediction at President Obama's inauguration, and a founder of the SCLC and worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr, and was a key leader in the bus boycott which was incited by Rosa Parks.)

UWsyqLrwaa	The Girl Who Could Fly by Victoria Forester     The Girl Who Could Fly is a must read for  everyone who likes real life meets fantasy  books. Like Anne of Green Gables,The Girl  Who Could Fly begins in an endearing small  town farm community and suddenly takes you  into a fantasy world like Harry Potter.  With each chapter you are given a very well  written and detailed look into a fascinating  world never yet described in any other book  or film. The story sucks you in and you find  yourself not wanting to put the book down.       Deadly Little Secret by  Laurie Faria Stolarz     Up until three months ago, everything in sixteen-year-old Camelia's life had been fairly ordinary: decent grades; an okay relationship with her parents; and a pretty cool part-time job at the art studio downtown. But when Ben, the mysterious new guy, starts junior year at her high school, Camelia's life becomes anything but ordinary.  Rumored to be somehow responsible for his ex-girlfriend's accidental death, Ben is immediately ostracized by everyone on campus. Except for Camelia. She's reluctant to believe the rumors, even when her friends try to convince her otherwise. She's inexplicably drawn to Ben...and to his touch. But soon, Camelia is receiving eerie phone calls and strange packages with threatening notes. Ben insists she is in danger, and that he can help--but can he be trusted? She knows he's hiding something... but he's not the only one with a secret.|`|AA12074717	The Road, Cormac McCarthy (So Good!)|`|EW4zX8lnaa	Hmm I'm not huge on series books but I do love the Ender's Game series--they are very well written and can be enjoyed by any audience, young, old, male, female.|`|cHxaWW0taa	...

kzkrll3Xaa	no, it sucks, but being "an animal" is kinda sexy lol :P|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Just why beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|8nexYdUjaa	I think you know the answer...of COURSE it is !!  it's an amazing gift that should be cherished =)  take care*|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	I would think so!|`|16bdbaab82deed99b2989cb05584df60aa	Only in the eye of the beholder|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	1st) what is beauty?    2nd) Specify how you are defining human    If you define beauty as, "something that is perfect the way it is, neither having to add or remove anything," and define being human as, "being imperfect," than is would seem that the two are contradictory.|`|mlYzEtNXaa	Some might say everyone is beautiful on the inside, but have you ever cut open a human? It's not particularly beautiful.|`|2LlC6AWHaa	yes, in good ways and bad. we are more evolved than other mammals and can create wonderfully sophisticated systems and machines like for the hospital, however we have created weapons that hurt more people than they save.|`|FoIxsunVaa	I am beauty immune. I see people from the inside out. I generally like what I see, even though I am too misanthropic to exploit that insight functionally.    Damn, my reading disability! I thought you said "Is there beauty in HUMAN BEINGS?"    How can we not be human? Coldness, cruelty, destructiveness, humor; these are almost exclusively human traits.

46zxsu1haa	It looks fine to me. If this is for a summer Intensive, you should bring what ever photos they ask for and a list of where you have studied along with the dates and teacher's names so you can fill in the application.

And bring bottled water and a towel for any audition.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	yeah thats nice, i would get the bottoms in black though, you will need your CV and your dancing shoes.....also you will want to bring some quick hydration drink :)|`|rFNvR4Kzaa	i think that is okay. i havent done like a true audition outside of my studio but i think that will work. resume and photograph??|`|JWu1exdQaa	This should be good!

kV9KIEHmaa	Smooth is like the clarity and the flawlessness involved in flowing from one move to the other.  You achieve it by anything else: practice, practice, and more practice.  It comes from knowing the dance and being able to gt from one move to the next without making it "choppy" or sloppy or making it look like you have to stop and think about each next move.    As for the last question, both.  It comes more naturally to those who have been doing it for a while, because (most of the time) they know what they're doing.  . . .And, in time, the way they learned is by: training your body.      Hope I helped! Dance is so much fun!|`|X7dC6Z08aa	You are probably dancing to jerky.  Aloow your dance moves to flow together.  Heres what i did.  when choreographing my own routines, I was told to choreograph on more of the 1/2 counts.  Let me explain.   Here are the counts i danced on when people though I danced jerky (not smooth)   ....  1,2,3, 4,5,6,7,8....1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8  Here was my improvement......1 and 2, 3,4 5and 6 and eh 7 and 8.  This of cource is just and example but if you were to dance to the counts where there are more ands and eh's you'd notice that your choreography takes less breaks and your body is constaintly in motion.  When your body is constaintly in motion, your choreography is considered smooth.  Does that make sense?  Practice and time and an idea on how things are achieved will definetly help.|`|L1yrOZTCaa	Smooth is just mainly your ability to blend your moves together to form a dance or not looking so choppy. It is the being able to move and feel the beat of the song that you are dancing to. Being smooth with your moves just comes with time and practice, there really isn't any training that needs to be done. Just keeping doing what your doing and smooth will come in time, as long as you keep yourself loose, energetic, and defined.

0HAn67yZaa	lynch Name Meaning and History  Irish: reduced Anglicized form of Gaelic  Loingsigh descendant of Loingseach, a personal name meaning mariner (from long ship). This is now a common surname in Ireland but of different local origins, for example chieftain families in counties Antrim and Tipperary, while in Ulster and Connacht there were families called  Loingseachin who later shortened their name to  Loingsigh and also Anglicized it as Lynch.   Irish (Anglo-Norman): Anglicized form of Gaelic Linseach, itself a Gaelicized form of Anglo-Norman French de Lench, the version found in old records. This seems to be a local name, but its origin is unknown. One family of bearers of this name was of Norman origin, but became one of the most important tribes of Galway.   English: topographic name for someone who lived on a slope or hillside, Old English hlinc, or perhaps a habitational name from Lynch in Dorset or Somerset or Linch in Sussex, all named with this word.|`|m2E4rLxgaa	i would guess english.|`|WIv1jPleaa	Lynch is about as Irish as they come.

I love that scene because it sets a very dark mood.    My absolute favorite scene would be the battle at Hogwarts. Not only was it funny, but it brought together all of the characters.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	I really enjoyed them from the start, but what really got me was the scene where harry is walking to his "death" and he brings back all the people who died with the Resurrection Stone and they are all telling him it will be alright.

Some of my fondest memories are reading the books.|`|wKSvnna2aa	I didn't want to read the HP books at first because I REALLY dislike the actors in the films, and the movies themselves disintegrated as the series progressed. But I gave it a chance more than once. I started liking the series a bit because of Ginny Weasley in Book 2. I could relate to her a lot, and I did like scenes with Harry in The Burrow. The Weasleys are a really interesting family.    But my actual addiction began in Book 3, with the whole Sirius episode. Like the other person, I also loved the confrontation scene with Sirius, Peter Pettigrew, and Lupin.|`|ZNvterQyaa	well i love al the books but my fave bit is the bit Sirius, Peter Pettigrew, Snape, and Lupin in Prisoner of Azkaban. That's my favorite book in the whole series and sirius. hargrid, Lupin, Tonks, snape and dumbledore are my fave charaters oh and dracos sweet too|`|VlzPRzQaaa	This answer is going to be very odd, but it is when Cedric dies.  Not because I liked that, but JKR made her series very difficult to predict with that.  Readers realized, with each passing death, that anyone could be killed, even Harry at the end.  That's the point that these were no longer kids books.  A lot had to be sacrificed to defeat Voldemort, which made the story better to me.|`|j1DLyUnfaa	i'm not completely sure.  all i know is i read the first three books and thought they were amazing but when i read the fourth one i was in love.  the chapter that got me to obsessed was The Prince's Tale in the deathly hallows.  that chapter is just beyond words.  i can't pick one scene that amde me fall in love with the series though!  although since the first time you meet ginny i knew she and harry were meant for each other and that really kept my interest.  their relationship growing throughout the series, i think, is very realistic because they don't just look at each other and fall in love.  it's a love that grows.  although ginny knew it before harry that first stages for her were just a crush and that deepened into true love.  that's not really a scene but it is a favorite part of  the series for me.    *)  ?.??.?*) ?.?*)  (?.?

BzWQap1Haa	Nature is all about open spaces and unobstructed views, but when people live together too closely, without boundaries (like walls), they tend to irritate each other.  Human flaws are magnified by proximity and therefore to live peacefully with others, people need boundaries and privacy.     Hope this helps.  Of course, this is an opinion and all poetry is up for interpretation.

She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.

I also love Shannon Hale works.|`|kIwABSTtaa	Well James Patterson has some really good books and is a great mystery author and I love every book he writes and he has written over 30 of them    Another is Jodi Picoult, she writes some pretty good novels that have an unexpected twist, and some of her books involve issues that people think about hard after they read the book.    Sara Dussen is a good author as well    Mary Higgins Clark if you are into mystery again she writes some pretty good books    If you love books that are kind of sad and happy then Larene McDaniel is a great author.  Most of her books are about cancer patients and recovering or not recovering and about the family trying to make it through the test of strength. ( not sure on how to spell her first name though) ( One of her books is I'll be seeing you)|`|XgH9uuv9aa	try below|`|2RlZgk2Laa	The Host - Stephenie Meyer      Uglies - Scottwesterfeld.  also his continuations (pretties, specials, extras)|`|5t0DYU6Baa	Sure, if you let us know what kinds of books you like.

mQmOLNWFaa	1) calm down.  Maybe your blowing this whole beginning band captain thing a little too out of proportion.  You're in seventh grade, not a big deal YET.      2) kids will be kids.  Accept it.  When I was in junior high I was annoyed by the people in my band.  They were immature, did not listen our director, and they were not dedicated.  Half of the class ever practices, much less brings their instruments home.  Just try you're best.  If you're really into this whole "beginning band captain" thing then just show that you're TRYING.  In my opinion you're trying too hard.  Here's a little story.  I was in eighth grade, principle flute, and i was at the winter concert.  This girl who was the seventh grade beginning band flute section leader was so bossy!  It was freaking annoying.  So, I don't mean to offend, but try not to show that you're trying too hard.  They are going to think you're annoying and gang up on you.  This is where you act tough.  Don't be scared to offend some people (i sound like a jerk but it's life).  Tell them to shut up and just walk away.  Don't be afraid to be the bad guy, just don't be an anoying bad guy, this just encourages them all to talk back.  Sorry, i wish there was some magic way to get them to shut up but it's junior high.  What are they like... 12- 13 years old?    3) argh and don't complain about setting up for the advance band kids.  It's not that big of a deal.  they're annoying bla bla bla bla.  Doesn't matter.  In the end they'll probably get all the things prepared because the parents are coming.    4) just saying... if you really like band don't quit because of your classmates.  High school band (depending on where you go) is generally more ... well... dedicated.      It's junior high, relax.    5)oh hahaha i almost forgot talking about the clarinet part.    Anways, just get a private teacher.  They'll act as your guide.  Learn your scales, embouchure, do long tones, get a music theory book and you'll already be in good shape.  In this process of learning scales (which is very important) you'll learn all your fingerings and everything.|`|0IwZb8quaa	just practice! review the notes you know and their places on the music every other day, and be sure to play your songs for your family. as for the kids, just try being calm yourself. also, assign seating among each of the instruments if you can so they dont talk. it might also help to keep them continually busy.|`|5df66f896b57cf84a8a9e5ec4774bf03aa	Get used to it. Assuming you stay in music, you will be catering to these fools for the rest of your school career. But do stay in it.     Learn your scales. That is THE most important part of playing well. Nearly every Piece you are going to every play will be composed of scales and the chords that are contained in that key. I only have played a pitched instrument since 9th grade and as soon as I got in college I advanced greatly. You wanna know why? Not because my prof taught me any novel idea, but because he forced me to learn my scales.   "Know your scales so well that you can be woken up at 3am, handed a trombone and told to play your c  harmonic minor scale in 3rds. And you would be able to play it perfectly."-My professor.    The only other thing you can really do to advance yourself is to listen to as many different recordings of famous clarinetists in every style. This will help you shape your tone and style to a more advanced sound.|`|AA11075358	UM difficult    1) Change your expectations!  Despite what you may think you can't control your band mates mouths. They are their own people with control over their own tongues. Don't expect that you can instantly tell them to shut their mouths. No teacher can do this get used to the fact that music is noisy! Remember you are one of them , not a teacher, if you start acting like the teacher then they will not respect you. Don't expect that you have their respect automatically, Respect is earned.     2) Make it fun!  For everything that you need to do make if fun. Remember kids don't have to be there. They play in band because its fun. So make it fun! They are probably talking because it boring! There are SO many music games that you can do. One of the things I do to get my students back on track if they start talking is a silly word or phrase that they know . Get together with your band teacher and come up with some ideas! For setting up for band concert make it a race. each student has a row to do and first to get it done gets something. Yes its bribery but it always works :)    AS far as playing clarinet well there are a few things   - Get a private teacher not just your band teacher one who specilses in tha Clarinet playing. A good teacher is worth gold.   - Know your scales! Scales are the main things that music is based on so do the boring work and know your scales.  - Practice daily practice the right skils every day. 5-10 minutes of good practice is the key. Do your long notes (remember to listen to yourself and use your breath support) tackle the tricky pieces and practice sight reading too! Again a good teacher can show you what to do!    Good luck

I used to be obsessive over the Harry Potter series, and the H.P. books went on The Shelf, which for me is the shelf in my room for my favorite series. I took them down and put up Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, and The Host.   Twilight is a well-written book. A gorgeous vampire who falls for an ordinary girl. You can connect to Bella, and you can dream and fantasize over Edward Cullen (I love him!). And, seeing that you have read it, you know too that you can read it a million times in a row and not get sick of it.  And, as for the Twilight-haters, which is usually guys, the guys don't like it because girls pay more attention to it than a guy. :)    Twi-hards rule!

dwVqj7ugaa	While art can certainly be internal, that is only a very modern aspect of it.  Art has always been a social commentator, sometimes reflective, and sometimes inflammatory.  Artists demand that we see the world as they do, understand the ills and miracles through their eyes.  Art can also be an interpretive historical record.  We look to art to give us a vision of the past.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty old-fashioned when it comes to art.  I have to see a demonstration of mastery, some acknowledgment of relevant place in the stream of artists through out time.  Those artists who claim to live in a bubble, or have no influences, or claim that their work is all about them--I usually find that work very uninteresting... more importantly, I don't connect.|`|a13f9a2523a56efc023ccc628c9d72a6aa	Art is exploration. We use it to find out who we are. What we look like and what we are looking at. Art is metaphysical - i.e. beyond the realm of the physical - it is the exploration of the realm of the intangible that we have within us.<br>  <br>  Geesh! That's obvious!
1CVOHoapaa	WW1 helped to bring about the depression on many levels. Firstly there was the monetary cost of a 4 year conflict. All the countries involved spent huge amounts. The british were virtually if not actually bankrupt by the end of the war.  There was also the feelgood factor after the war with all the nations involved breathing a sigh of relief. people got back on with the business of buying and, not unlike now, banks loaned money heavily and with less collaterel than previously. The middle classes would, for the first time, borrow money to invest in stocks.  There was a feeling of invincibility brought on by surviving the war years. This led to over spending and over investment.  As things began to fall apart panic amongst the people new to the financial markets ensued. It snowballed and the losses grew. So yes WW1 had its own impact on the depression
X7dC6Z08aa	If you want to be really good, you must find teh right teacher.  It may be more expensive but its worth the money.  Good teachers focus on technique and you are more likely to start out learning good dance habits that are harder to fix as you get older.  To find a good teacher, go to different studios and watch.  If you know anyone who is a very good dancer who is about your age, ask where they take?  you are never too young to learn to dance but the younger you start the better.  This is a good time for you to get into dance but to be good its not just hard work.  It's sore muscles, and a lot of time and concintration.  It is also very fun so I hope you decide to give it a try.  Also, if ballet turns out to be not as fun, try jaz.  I personally love jaz and hiphop.    Here are some small tips for when you start:  Push you shoulders down, even when you have your arm or arms in the air.  Keep good pasture (keep your back straight and tummy in)  Do not stiffen your arms. Even when you are suppose to have straight arms, try to keep teh elbow slightly relaxed.  So good luck and I hope you enjoy ballet.  I payed about 8 dollars a week for an hour session.|`|GR4O5m4Saa	umm it kinda hard to learn ballet if you don't take lessons|`|7yvRXjzEaa	Most studios, including mine in the suburbs on NY have teen beginner classes.   Call around to all the dance studios tell them u are interested in trying ballet classes , ur 13 and u have no experiences. they may ask u to come in to look at u... and if u have a natural talent and are good enough they may place u in a level if not they will put u in a teen beginner level ( if they have on )    most dance studios will not turn students away. also if u have the money for it u can offer to take private classes with a teacher there and see if u can get a feel for it, or even get caught up enough to be placed into a level.|`|JMEghB3Zaa	well if u wanna be good, ur gonna have to take ballet lessons (its NOT weird) you can learn, it will be hard and you will be frustrated at times, but you can learn. just practice hard, and do your apsolute best. u can do it!|`|wx7GRNL4aa	For the start, being flexible is perfect for ballet!!! It doesn't really matter how old you are as long as you focus, and practice at home. When I was little I used to do ballet. I also hated it becausebi hatedthe class. It was a big mistake that I made, but I quit. I now regret that descision bcause I would have been more advanced now. I have recently just started back and I am now 14. My advise would be to stretch at home. Warm up before you go. The only way you are going to learn is if you take class. After class, write down what you think that you need to work on. ( that's what I do ) that way you will be prepared for working on I in your next class. Also, when a teacher corrects you, don't take it personal. It's good if fthey give you corrections because that shows that they want to move you up into a higher level. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it!!!|`|ZXxMXZ75aa	i have girls at my studio that take teen ballet classes and they are like 13, 14, 15. I am thirteen. i have been dancing for a year and a half and i just got my first pair of pointe shoes today! Keep in mind i danced for 4 hours a week for one year and now dance for 7 hours a week.|`|Z19gRYZwaa	You are never going to learn ballet properly without dance lessons: that's why class exists, to give you a more experienced dancer to help you figure things out and to prevent you from developing bad habits that lead to problems with your muscle development. All ballet dancers take class, from the six year olds just starting to train to the principle dancers at the National Ballet. Why does it seem weird?

I suggest ordering them online..You know your size now so you can just purchase them over the internet and there are tons more styles.|`|aHgO3E8Iaa	Yes that should be fine, as long as they are demi pointe shoes and not demi pointe brand. (Bloch makes a demi pointe brand that is actually a pointe shoe thats all satin and has a hard toe.) As a beginner you're going to want the soft shoe, as you can break you ankles if you go on pointe before your strong enough. The actual brand of soft shoes doesn't matter that much, the split toes are just easier to point in.     To soften the shoe, I recommend folding it in half when you store it, it'll be easier to point this way, and will mimic the effect of a split toe shoe.     Good luck, you'll have tons of fun.|`|GR4O5m4Saa	Yeah, it will be fine, check with your teacher though. The shoes are basically the same except the split sole shoes are easier to break in

ijXQvtFEaa	umm..... you aren't a good reader if you hadn't caught this. Esme said that he should do anything to stay because she couldn't bear to lose another child like the one she lost a few days after it was born when she was human. Also, in the movie, she stared at him because she was worried about him so she watched him to make sure he wouldn't do anything bad to Bella. Either that or just bad acting. Another thing, Esme didn't have a thing for Edward because then, she would have like destroyed Bella in the very beginning, but instead she was happy that Edward had found someone.     P.S. one of the answers above me is incorrect. Edward was supposed to marry Rosalie, not Esme! Carlisle was supposed to marry Esme that's why he saved her! He found Rosalie so that Edward could feel the same way for someone like carlisle felt for Esme.|`|9HCypvHJaa	WHY are you asking this question again? Were you not satisfied with the other answers you got, disagreeing with your theory? Will you only stop when you have convinced everyone that you are right (even though you are horribly, horribly wrong)? Wow. Grow up!|`|cdBi69p5aa	i think esme just cares alot about edward but not in a motherly way.....more like a brotherly way.........and it says in the books that edward is her favorite because edward was the one who has been there for all her vampire life except carlise............i think esme just loves edward in a brotherly kind of way.........|`|Xd19d4aqaa	haha read closer she does it mentions in the book how they were supposed to get married but edward didnt like her|`|J0G4lRrNaa	Nah, she is married to Carlisle.  I think she just feels protective of him , he was her first "kid", and she doesn't want him leaving her. She is excited in the first book, because she watns Edward to be with Bella so he is finally happy like Alice and Jasper, Emmett and Rosalie.  For the movie part, that was just the actor. I though she was staring at Bella though. XD.|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	She doesn't have a thing for him! The movie sucked. I loved the book better.|`|zWW5sO1Caa	i dont think so....  but honeslty this whole Twilight thing is getting WAY too much attention! its a stinking movie for crying outloud!!|`|H2sULRQFaa	please step out of your twitard world, and think about this for a minute.  the woman who plays the fictional character of esme, has nothing to do with the actual substance of the role in the book.  and the book, all the characters, are all developed from the mind of a single woman. these are not real people. they DO NOT EXIST.   i think your imagination is getting a little too crazy.|`|uknqrDZsaa	Dats weird but funny also. He is her favorite because he has been around longer than her and she has been with him the longest. Plus, his transformation was different than the rest. Carlisle not only changed Edward because he was about to die but also because he was lonely. He stopped being lonely when he created Esme. Rosalie was suppose to do the same thing for Edward and Emmett was for Rosalie. Alice and Jasper were not changed by Carlisle. Saying this, Edward has a close connection with Carlisle and that's why he is Carlisle favorite. Because he and Esme are so much in love, her automatic unconditional love is stronger for Edward.    Another reason I think Edward is her favorite is because he is the tortured soul in the family. Everyone else has someone and he has been lonely for his whole life (which is pretty long). She has the ability to love unconditionallly and it rubs off most on Edward because he has previously had no one else to love him.|`|NvWSOxawaa	actually, that was rosalie, thats why shes such a ***** to bella, becuase edward didnt think she was good enough. and i think it is just a strong mother love. after all her child in her human life died (thus is why she jumped off a cliff and was changed), so edward was really her first son (even though she came after him, still shes the parental figure) lol.    hope that explains itt.

946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	In the fourth book the vampire who left the volturi gaurd with Carmine I can't think of his name said that he could feel the potential even in humans for there extra gift.  And he said that she has to have had a POWERFUL gift for it to manifest in her human form.  But then it is also told by Stephanie Meyer that is her mind is very private which is why it can not be heard.  But Alice was hospitalized when she was younger cause she had visions in the human form also.  So they do show signs in there human forms it is just not thought as an extra gift for Bella until it is discovered when she is a vampire.|`|AA12065466	she is am  everybody else is fm|`|CGcdZpztaa	her mind is safe, its kinda like a force field. just like alice could see the future when she was human, bella had the sheild, she just couldnt protect any1 else with it|`|vahxyGwYaa	because shes a shield.  as a vampire she is a shield and she was so meant for that role that even as a human she had the power to block out vampires from her mind.|`|70ihksK5aa	another reason i'm not really satisfied with twilight series' ending..  i think stephanie didn't plan very well as a bestseller author so she wrote at last minute and cant change her error from 1st book, i guess??

It said it quite plainly in the books.|`|km1vuLUzaa	some powers, they have it since they were human  like Alice, she could see the future even before she was change|`|FObFxc6maa	Because he author of twilight did not plan her story corectly or maybe because bella was not human. She was machine.  Or maybe because edward was just pretending to hear thoughts. Or maybe because I haven't read the books. Or maybe because just because|`|ASwTNY89aa	a plot twist. It would be no good if he could. unfortunatlly, meyer isnt good enough an auther to have reasons behind the things in her books. Why couldnt edward hear her thoughts? why did they love each other? ect...     If there was a reason for Edward not being able to read her thoughts then Meyer would have revailed it in BD. Meyer just didnt write it well, is all|`|rrC72eBEaa	Its hard to say, I honestly think it was just something Stephanie Meyer came up with to make the story interesting without thinking of a reason because there is a lot of points that really don't make sense if you actually think about it.    Just think, Edward can't attend a blood testing class, but he can survive high school with menstruating women?    I don't know..  maybe its because when people love each other they have a feeling they know what they are talking about, but are never quite sure.|`|WlkE98OQaa	Because your talents as a human are hi-lighted as a vampire. As a human, Bella didn't let others know what she was thinking.|`|9ToFRXYKaa	bella's mind in human form is special.  in a way that she blocks edward from reading her mind    remember when carlisle said that vampires get there gifts from there strongest human traits?  well bellas strongest trait was keeping her mind closed. there for edward cant read her mind  at the very last few pages of breaking dawn bellas allows edward to hear her thoughts.    hope that kinda helped  sorry if it was confusing|`|uknqrDZsaa	She is only safe inside her mind. I guess it is her minds way of adapting to her physical weakness and constant bad luck. Like Alice's visions as a human, Bella mind cannot be read. Alice, as a vampire, can see the future whenever she wants. Now that Bella is a vampire, she can make her shield include others or disappear completely. The secrecy of her thoughts were not her vampire power, it is what got stronger.|`|Sf0BL2oFaa	I think it is because her mind was meant to work as a shield, right?  She just didn't know it and she wasn't aware of it.  When she became a vampire, and found out what she could and couldn't do, then she could control it.     That's just my theory, and it's not a very fleshed out one, it's just hard to explain.  You're right though, Meyer doesn't really specify that.

Lois Lowry once said in an interview that she doesn't know whether Jonas really reached Elsewhere or whether the cold and being exhausted was getting to him and he was dying and hallucinating.

Just take some time out of your day to do some flexing exercises, like rolling your ankles in circular directions, flexing your feet and pointing your toes.    Basic grade one stuff I know, but it all helps.    What I do to warm up is hold onto my kitchen bench for support, rise onto my toes (and yes, don't let your feet splay out because this will injure you) if your ankles keep rolling out just try going onto the balls of your feet.    With the bench as balance bend your knees up and down.    With my knees bent I then rotate to the sides, all still on my toes.    Um, hope this helps...

My question is why would you not just buy a Squier or used Fender strat?    You'll pay at least $300 for the Dean custom, plus the cost of repainting/refinishing it and adding the pickguard...upwards of $500!    In this case, I'd buy a Fender.    Kabum

pIvN6TY7aa	I was pleasantly surprised to find out how readable Benjamin Franklin's autobiography was.  He's more self-satisfied than I would like, but he's also got a cutting wit.    The "Autobiography of Malcolm X" is another one that deserves a good look.  I don't think it's possible to imagine two people more different than Mr. Franklin and Mr. X, and their biographies, too, are very different.    Each, in its own way is much to be recommended.|`|iB6lWUfnaa	Okay--The first step is to stop saying self-autobiography. It's redundant,    The second step is to stop saying 'most well written'.

AA10729675	Trade and transport means what trade owed to transport in the Middle Ages.   I would do this:  First I would examine what kind of transport they had (and of course we all know they did not have trains, buses, cars or airplanes so what remains is: carts, horses, boats).  Where do those carts go?  Where are those boats sailing to, and on which river, which seas?  And I assume it is in Europe, right?    There are plenty of roads there, and rivers.  Roads were made by the Romans already.    Once you state the means of transport and the geographical parts of transport,  then examine the trade.    Who, what, where, when, and for whom?  Kings were not the only ones who needed silk.   In the Middle Ages the silk road was extremely important.  We say "silk road" but that road coming from Xian in China subdivided into many roads.  And if it were only silk, it would be easy.  But they also were used to carry spices from India, and medicinal herbs from both China and India, and incense, and pearls, but also certain ingredients for paintings. For instance, many churches in Europe were painted blue with powdered lapis-lazulis, extremely expensive.  More so than gold!  And gold was also transported.  But food also.    So, you do all this study about trade in the Middle Ages.  And you show how transport was crucial for the trade, how it was protected, how sometimes it was not (pirates, thieves on roads) so trade was dangerous.    Then you may focus on one item of the trade and one item on transport: for instance just ships and what they carried and when.  You analyze: again who, what, when, where, why, and for whom (without repeating the same thing as in the first part) and you then synthesize, which means that you put it all together and you give an evaluation:  like for instance ships were less expensive than horses and more secure (maybe it is the other way around, maybe both were as insecure and as expensive).  And you say what you think of such a trade OBJECTIVELY.  In the conclusion, you enlarge the subject to all time, to all trade, to all the world and you show how it has developed, and how the Middle Ages have led to this development on its own.    This is just a suggestion.|`|4jSeMJ2Xaa	You could do the Hanseatic League (northern Europe), you could do the Silk Road and spread of disease, you can explore the Irish Sea and trade between Vikings, British and the Mediterranean.

egeuNalTaa	Hi Carolina, this is a very big question.  Oil paints offer some advantages over acrylics, in that they take longer to dry, allowing time for blending and modeling.  They also offer a better quality of pigment (opinion here) so your colors are stronger.  if you are painting objects, such as flowers and are trying to paint them somewhat realistically, then oils will offer you time to vary shades of the colors.  But this can be done with acrylics as well if you are fast.    if i can offer an opinion, to paint in oils offers YOU, the artist, some personal experience in the tactile pleasure of painting.  the aroma, the colors, the historical connection to the Masters.  Oil painting is a form of shameless self indulgence, i would strongly encourage you to do it, at least once.  be warm and well, jb|`|afc818594423abb198b9222afe9865c9aa	I am a self taught traditional artist.

3159ba3bf7bf777ace6d092394020e75aa	Sonnet CXXX    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;  Coral is far more red than her lips' red:  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.  I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,  But no such roses see I in her cheeks;  And in some perfumes is there more delight  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know  That music hath a far more pleasing sound.  I grant I never saw a goddess go:  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare  As any she belied with false compare.     -- William Shakespeare
cUMMlwp1aa	lol okay all these people who say it is about Joe Jonas are 100% incorrect  she wrote the song over a year ago. Before she even met Joe  she wrote it about this guy she was like talking to, but not dating officially. And her family and friends didn't exactly approve of him. They never dated, but she got the idea to write a song about a love that prevails through all obstacles and kind of revolve it around Romeo and Juliet, without the death at the end. She wanted to say that sometimes love can last through anything.  It's a wonderful song  and definitely not about Joe Jonas.  yuck|`|Hp6GLCopaa	It was because Joe Jonas and her were going out for a long time. She loved him SO much.

0aEYjVzMaa	listen to the music over and over and try to get a rhythm in your head.  if you can't quite picture it then go to a dancer or musician who knows how to do that.  make sure you listen to it over and over and get a feel for the music.  then, picture what kind of steps you want to go to it.  go on youtube, they might have a music video or someone dancing to it that might give you some ideas.  if you see a cool dance move that you know you can do and it's not a total misfit like a hip-hop move to a lyrical dance, then you can add that on.  keep the choreography moving, you don't want to stay in one place for too long.  add jumps, spins, kicks, whatever you want.  when you add a new step make sure you add the timing and know how many 8 counts it's going to take.    and make sure to keep going over and over your dance.  you don't want to forget the choreography.  good luck with your dance!|`|DNre29JWaa	Well, most songs are written in 4/4, so the counts are in eights. As far as the number of counts per song goes, it depends on the length of the song, there is no set amount of counts. I agree with the first answer, just listen to song until you know or at least are familiar with the music, lyrics, and beats. Usually if I have to choreograph something, then I get familiar with music until I can sort of visualize movements that go with the counts and music. If you are having trouble with the counting, then just choreograph the dance to the words. Try to think outside of the box to make different choreography and step out of your comfort zone. Good luck, making choreography is so much fun!!

WIpeC3gRaa	I wish I could latin dance, so I'm jealous of you! My best friend and I watch So You Think You Can Dance almost religiously, and when they do latin style dance it usually leaves us in awe. It's "Dancing With The Stars" that puts ballroom in a bad light because it's just washed up celebrities trying to have their comeback. When you see professionals like Pasha Kovalev and Anya Garnis do it, it's insane. Don't stop doing it, because I love watching it!|`|AA11065140	Whatev.  It's just ignorant people, so why care what they think?|`|XzdQzO5Waa	Actually I think that outlook is changing. Dancing with the Stars has publicized it a lot, showing how "sexy" it can be. I'm 15, and have been dancing since I was very young. But, I only take things like ballet, jazz, tap, lyrical, etc. After watching these shows, I've wanted to broaden my horizons soo much! Unfortunately, living in a small midwest town limits your options so I can't really take any classes. I just bought a dvd on latin dancing so maybe I can learn some there? Haha    But anyway, just ignore them for now. Once they finally realize how magnificent you are and how awesome it is, they will be blown away. Keep dancing knowing that you work those moves confidently! :D|`|AuQ8r9tMaa	I agree, and I get the same thing, though not to your extent (I'm 20).  Just keep your chin up and do what you love. It doesn't matter if they understand or not.|`|oucx3qgoaa	I started when I was your age and kids in my grade did stereotype me a little bit. I completely agree with you about how the dancers on DWTS make it look easy, giving ballroom dancing yet another stereotype to it. However, DWTS has made the public appreciate ballroom and Latin dancing a bit more. I say, if your heart is in it, go for it! And tell your partner the same thing. Besides, in most high schools, you need to take a course in physical education on social dance, and you and your partner will be in the center stage spotlight(some kids will be desperate for a good grade so they'll want someone who can dance!).    Good luck and remember your not alone! ;)
xj5KnGwEaa	In older cultures, it was typical to purchase a plot of land on which to bury someone before they were actually dead. Walking over someone's grave was considered a sign of disrespect; walking over someone's grave while they were still alive was considered a sign that you wished them harm or bad luck, or sometimes even that it was an active threat. In context of the book, Aunt Alexandra means that she felt a sense of foreboding ("a pinprick of apprehension").|`|ajwIPeFXaa	Often, when people get a shiver not caused by cold, they say someone walked over their grave. I don't know if that properly answers your question or not.
svE8Pc27aa	Wow, that was quite good. Every time I hear the words "preteen writer" I cringe and think of the obvious. So you can't imagine how happy I was to read this. Really like the main character, and Ralph, even though no lines were spoken. One little piece of criticism, try not to separate you sentences so much with commas, each idea has to stand on it's own.|`|6YyeqVMQaa	i don't get it.  but maybe that's just me.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Even for a teenager, this would be very good. Try not to begin your sentences with "And" so much. Either take away/ replace the "and" or combine two sentences into a longer sentence. Also, try to remove the "and" from your longer sentences. It seems like "and" is the only conjunctive you use to lengthen sentences. Add some variation.|`|8Ha7sN8Naa	really good book, especially for a preteen
46zxsu1haa	Check the Ballet Talk Website under SIs. You must register first to use the site, but there is no fee. They have tons of info about all the summer intensives and blogs by students who have gone to them. The site is monitored by professional ballet dancers so wrong answers are pulled.  I'm sorry, but I have no personal experience with that SI.
Pu7TON79aa	I haven't done that SI, but I heard it was pretty good. I suggest you check out the Ballet Talk website. They will give you all the info you need about any SI. Great site!

X7dC6Z08aa	allusion.  My dance teachers used to try to get me to do them all the time.  Keep in mind, the higher you get your leg behind you, the better they look.   I'm sure you are talking about an allusion because you said one food stays on the ground. An allusion is where you bend over while turning to face the back and one leg does a fan kick behind the body.  At the end of an allusion your body is usually facing front again.  This does kinda give a cartwheel like effect if done well.|`|AuQ8r9tMaa	Ask your coach again. Or make something up. If they have questions, describe it, then demonstrate it. Everyplace I've ever danced has had different names for the same steps. Most experienced dancers half expect it.

IKnmaRKHaa	It was at the end of the book, and here's what it said...    Dear People of Ember,       We came down the river from the Pipeworks and found the way to another place. It is green here and very big. Light comes from the sky. You must follow the instructions in this message and come on the river. Bring food with you. Come as quickly as you can.  Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow.    then they enclosed the instructions with a rock in Doon's shirt, and sent it down to Ember.|`|MeOOUhHkaa	The instructions of how to get out of Ember.    I loved the City of Ember series :D    They are 12, actually.

fDfUcAkhaa	in the school hallway you pass me by  you ignore my feelings, you shove them aside  but behind my happy, smiley guise  is a broken heart, is that such a surprise?     the next time we pass my face tear-eyed  still you have simply denied  that my broken heart has bled and cried    the third time we passed in the hallway   your gaze penetrates me, your hurtful words mold like clay    you never see me again in that hallway, you wonder "where is she"?   that night i committed suicide  my broken heart remains broken for all eternity      the last line shouldn't rhyme since it's more serious and solemn. i hopep you like these suggestions! keep writing, you're doing very well! whenever you write something, store it in a special box, and then years later you can take it back out and improve on it, like i just did with your poem! writing takes practice, practice, practice, and more practice. keep a diary, and you can write everynight in it. that is also good inspiration for poetry. that was a very unique poem and a cool idea!|`|5j0NgLDmaa	You'll get through these feelings you're going through, I promise.|`|aujHVGFiaa	sorry i dont|`|CcHkZehoaa	its more of a story you'd read in a book than a poem. sorry.

MeOOUhHkaa	Most definitely.     Is it possible to write about skydiving without actually skydiving? Or traveling to Europe?|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Not convincingly|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	Definitely. You would be surprised- overwhelmed- by the number of virgins who write erotic fiction.|`|AA11703549	It's possible. People always write about experiences they've never had. if people only stuck to what they've done, a lot of books would be insanely boring.|`|TrUjyEJAaa	I'm sure its possible. It might not be very realistic, but most sex thats written isn't all that realistic anyhow.|`|0xiHNsmVaa	I don't really think so. I think certain things should experienced before you write about them.|`|8d0PhOjEaa	Haha.Yeah. It's just like anything else you've written about that you've never experienced. You know how it goes, so just go off that and other writings about it. :)|`|Q49d8oD1aa	yes|`|AA10292836	YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU  WANT AND MAYBE GET A PULITZER PRIZE,ITS NOT WHAT YOU KNOW BUT HOW YOU KNOW IT!|`|5bLjvHV4aa	Of course it's possible! I'm writing about a demonic possession, but I've never been possesssed, knock on wood, hehe. Writing is about using your IMAGINATION. Good luck to you|`|aygUtJ1Raa	Yeah. It's like writing about death- you can write about it well without ever having experienced it.  But it's different...people have sex...they don't die then read a book.  But my point remains! Yes! It's possible! :)|`|NkjuLwbxaa	Of course it is. I've never kissed anyone and I've written about kissing. Though I'm not brave enough to try sex (my mom would flip) Good luck!|`|G88YLNrKaa	yeah, we've all seen enough sappy holly wood romance scenes..that strangely led to sex with a bra on (who leaves their bra on during sex?) ugh ...dont write about people leaving their bra on|`|wDrhWyUvaa	lol|`|lQm0R9SZaa	Just watch a bunch of porn ;)|`|uq1GXvSdaa	yeah but is more fun the other way|`|w3uYxwiraa	Yes, it certainly is possible. You can even be very graphic just using analogies and never describing the actual situation of your characters.
tzx9nWfmaa	We have played many amazing songs over the past few years I have been playing trumpet. As a high school player now, some of my favorite pieces we have ever played were a few of the following:    Variations on a Korean Folk Song  Third Suite  Clouds that Sail in Heaven   Mock Morris  Entrance of the Gladiators (that fun carnival song you always hear)    And just some fun ones I absolutely loved. Who doesn't love some rock turned into band music? =P    The 80's (a decade of hits)  Music from the Beatles  Soaring with John Williams (I know you said no John Williams, but this was one fun song!)    There are so many more, I just can't remember most of them now because we play so many lol...)    Hope this helps you, if you were trying to look for new pieces, I know this probably wouldn't give you much help because finding a certain piece of music nowadays is trying to find a needle in a haystack. =D|`|NLwfMSJWaa	listen to classical:  Richard Wagner  Ludwig Van Beethoven

wZFlfRahaa	Here are a few ideas:  - Her brother died (of cancer?) when he was only 5, and she was the only one with him when he died.   - Her friend committed suicide. If you want, in front of her.   - Her mother is depressed and Rain must take of her a lot.  - Rain had a eating disorder, had difficulties and struggled to find herself. In the end, she got better, but she was permanently scarred and lost friends.|`|JnSrN3guaa	maybe, when she was young, her mother always pressured her to be perfect, but then she got like, a B one day, and "coincidently" her mother died because of some "supernatural, or natural" murder, and she thought it was all her fault, so now, she's expecting something really really bad to happen next, and something worse, since a B "supposedly" killed her mother, then an "F" would like. . . idunno, freakkin destroy the world, man!! =]]    haha. idunno. stretch the plot a little, so you can come up with something koolio!! [:    :D|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Her Aunt commited suicide infront of her. That make you depressed.|`|J8xRVPulaa	How about something traumatic happened in her past, and she has blocked it out all these years. Now it is coming back to her in flashes.    The memory should have something to do with an epic plot.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	She loses her mother to Cancer, so her father get's depressed, and while working: finds himself fantasizing about suicide.  He attempts it, and gets placed in a mental ward- her little brother is becoming the school bully, and their aunt is living on welfare.  She's forced to get a full-time job, working evenings/nights, and doesn't have time to do her homework- and is struggling to keep up with staying awake in class.  She just becomes depressed, and finds herself skipping school, and getting involved with drugs.|`|aygUtJ1Raa	If you want a creative idea, make one up.|`|IgLi3Zcfaa	Someone she loves or cared about died. She could have been really active and one of her friends died. So she refuses to do them any more|`|wDrhWyUvaa	Someone who writes on Yahoo Answers, asking this question.|`|ixUEtbe2aa	She was abducted when she was young and experimented on in order to make her into the perfect government weapon. She was given speed, strength and intelligence beyond a normal human beings capabilities. But some years later they start to fail her and she's left wondering if the government thinks that she has outlived her usefulness.|`|HqWPJXlRaa	Well, maybe she was really down because of family problems when she got an F but she met someone who made her strong again. Someone who made her happy; he helped her succeed to get straight A's again. Not just that, he could have showed her a whole new amazing world, a world she formerly did not believe in. The world of love.
obuCEyv6aa	When she was young, she lived in a foster home where the other children/ care takers abused her. Ever since then, shes felt that shes not been good enough, so she does whatever it takes to be as close to perfect as possible. You could title it, Perfect. lol, sorry for overly suggesting ideas. Just use your imagination. : ) You really cant go wrong with it.|`|sZYbf0hcaa	Err... someone she was really close to commited suicide/died under horrific circumstances etc.  I could give you a whole heap of ideas, or you could just google odd or bizarre deaths.    Or maybe depression could just run in her family.  A hostage situation could be involved.  and um  well like, whatever happened, she could have constant flashbacks to it during crucial times in her life which leads to meltdown etc.|`|8d0PhOjEaa	Um...that's kind of hard. I think maybe something really bad happened once and she thinks its her fault. But whatever it is, I don't think it should be made known hat happened until around the end----maybe kidnapping, or a gang she was in killed her family, or a friend's suicide, or an abusive father or something. Sorry. This was a sucky answer. A for effort though.|`|r5c20sY1aa	She is perfect. In order to be normal she has to do things so awful that it balances her out. Getting that F was awful but it is the first time she ever purposefully showed her imperfection to the world. Now the world sees it and that frightens her and she wonders if she has made a mistake by letting them, the outside world, see her faultering.     When she was young she used to do things that most other children would have to seek council for but she never got caught or rather her parents never let it be known what she had done.....they didn't even let her know they were aware of what she had done. Everything was kept a perfect little secret.    The animals had just run away, that is why they went missing. The housekeeper/nanny could no longer keep house because she just got too old or rather that is why she left without saying a word even though she'd left the little girl she raised since infancy.    But one boy knew what happened. He used to play with "her" when he visited his grandmother who was "her" nanny. But that was when he was little.     Now they attend the same high school. He lives by a moral code of truth by conscience. The two codes she avoids at all cost.    Good luck!|`|uhchod38aa	She is being raised by her father. He never talks about her mother, except to say she's dead. It turns out she's not dead. Why did her father lie? The more she finds out, the more questions it leads to. What does she have to go on? Maybe a birth certificate and some old pictures. What happened to her mother? Did she just leave? Or was there something more sinister at play? Maybe she finds a clue in one of the pictures she has, something she never noticed before but suddenly it jumps out at her and it's really alarming or scary or shocking. This leads to an old newspaper search, where more mystery is revealed. For a while, she could suspect her father is guilty of a crime or maybe she briefly suspects he killed her mother. After searching and snooping around for awhile, she uncovers some letters, which lead to more mystery...in the end, she finds out where her mother is. She wants to run away to see her. But there may have been VERY GOOD REASONS why her father kept her from her mother to begin with. Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy? Or is it not that simple?    There's a start for you. You character, Rain, is sad and troubled because she has abandonment issues. On some level, she's going to believe that it's her fault her mother went away. You can get good mileage out of Rain imagining various scenarios concerning her mother's absence: was she abducted? Is she a spy? This story needs a creepy attic for the letters to be found in and a climax in the root cellar. Have fun.|`|cHxaWW0taa	I believe I already answered this question.|`|497a8432eaf0094209c9ade7803a9829aa	maybe a drunk father who abuses her emotionally...
XL2vg7eaaa	Okay, to all of you who say Twilight is a horrible book, it is not. If you have not read it them, who are you to judge? If you have, then you can talk. I am sick of people trashing Twilight when it is a perfectly fine book (for the most part). I agree with the person who talked about Hitler's book, it is horrible. So is the book The Poisonous Mushrooms. One of my least favorite books is The Phantom Toll Both, but I know a lot of people who like it too. Worst books really depend on the person and the genre, so yeah. Just out of curiosity, why do you ask?|`|jiXQ8eDFaa	Impossible by Danielle Steel.

I was bored one day so I read it. Not only did the main character SWEAR (yes! I'm serious! Swearing in a book for eight-year-olds!) but at the end, the main character stated he liked doing saumersaults at his friend's birthday party because when the girls flipped upside down he could see past their underwear.    Yes, I'm horrified too. Please, if you value your children/siblings well being, do not EVER let them read that book!|`|aygUtJ1Raa	Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn. The Host. BAD.

Edit: I'm not saying that I think that I think that Twilight is the worst book ever (thought I'm not saying I don't, either) I'm jsut sayign that this question is going to be flooded with Twilight answers. The worst book I have ever read was Ender's Game. It was really weird and I hated it. Also really sick and pervertred....|`|d5xtxBjNaa	Haha I'm sorry you're getting the WORST ANSWERS EVER.  & I don't think Twilight was the worst ever but i'm sure it's not at the top of the list.

N3asaDRaaa	gosh. good on you honey! I don't think i could do it, actually. Wicked's okay. The stage-show is better :) Harry Potter is A HUNDRED times better, but of course, what compares?     Hmm... hide the hary potter books, and get very involved in school work - so much so that you have no time left to think about HP, and if you find yourself thinking about it, do something else, RIGHT AWAY! maybe  get involved in lots of after school activities, to help keep your mind off it :)    cool screen name by the way - so true :)   Yeah, the mediater series (meg cabot) is quite good, but very teenage- girlish :) got a good plot tough, very action packed with a bit of romance :p, but not like twilight where the whole thing is romance! *BLEH*        Good luck, though! I don't think I could ever deprive myself of HP for that long!! :)  xox|`|uq1GXvSdaa	i"m Catholic an i love Harry Potter, there nothing wrong with that.|`|cHxaWW0taa	Well you would have to stop talking about them  watching the movies  going on the websites    and give up anything else potter related.|`|uSouun2saa	Wow!

Check out http://www.bardacademy.com    or  All American Girl by Meg Cabot  The Mediator Series by Meg Cabot|`|ztwobHpVaa	First of all LOVE your screen name! Second I am a former Catholic so here is what I know of Lent. Lent is a time to remember the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert praying and fasting. Traditionally people would just fast during lent, but it has become more common now to actually give something up for Lent. The theory is that Lent is suppose to be about giving up what you want the most in order to bring you closer to God. If you really want to participate try to think about the purpose of Lent. It's not about just giving something up, it's about sacrifice for the greater good (although since the theory is that Jesus died for our sins so we would not have to sacrifice anymore it kind of seems like a silly tradition, but hey to each their own). Hope this helped. By the way I always tried to give something up for Lent, but I never got to day 40 so do not feel bad if you can't make it.   "To err is human, to forgive divine." Alexander Pope|`|YdEx7cPLaa	I aggree, your screen name is really cool :) Well you would have to start by 'de-pottering' your computer (no hp wallpapers and stuff) cuz they will obviously remaind you of harry potter, and your bedroom too... you could start reading an alternative book, but make-sure you choose one you do like/find interesting, otherwise you might be tempted.

MuCNK2vxaa	I like it and I would also like to know your age. One thing though. Since you said that you wouldn't say how old you're pretty much giving away that you're young. I don't care anyway. It's pretty good except that I personally favor stories written in past tense. So instead of 'A new confidence pulses up inside me' I would put 'A new confidence pulsed up inside me'. I can see why you would put it as present though. (Especially since you're writing in first person.) Keep writing.    (edit) Cool. I'm thirteen too and I'm writing a book.

Back to your question, it sounds like an idea that would work, but it's like anything, you have to execute it well.    =]|`|cHxaWW0taa	Kind of sounds like pushing daises.

After discovering this, she posted it so her fans need not feel guilty reading the draft.  It is posted on her website and is in Edward's perspective.  http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...
CcHkZehoaa	Its beautiful!!! You can tell your a natural with this stuff!!!|`|XBulMn2zaa	Many of us have done most of the things in your poem. Some of us have done them all.  Some of them are done and can't be undone.  But some of them can stop.  Cutting and burning yourself doesn't take away any pain, it just changes it from pain in your mind to pain in your body which is permanent because of the scars.  Nothing is the way it seems, neither the good nor the bad.  No life can be perfect.  some can be better than others but all can be better than they are if we just be real, ask for help when we need it and give it to others when we can.  Most important of all is what we think.  Think sad thoughts and you stay sad, think happy thoughts, even if they aren't real and you will be less sad.  They say you can't stay sad if you smile so smile until it is real.  You have great insight and intense feelings.  Keep writing to express those feelings and to spread the power of your writing to others.

I think you need to put some spaces after your sentences.|`|aygUtJ1Raa	WHOO!! Let's see how many people can post their twilight theories. Delicious.   And obsessively pathetic.   It's just a book. Nice theory, and I honestly believe that would've been better than 4 books of "Oh, I LOVE YOU!! YOU'RE SO HOTTT!!!  Whisk me away to eternity, please, you sexy GOD!" Your idea actually is a plot.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	omg do you realize that its just a fake book? and i got the answers. Rosalie hates Bella because she is human and Rosalie will do anything to be human again an she is jealous of Bella..Rosalie didn't have any choice when she was turned into a vampire. and if you don't know Esme really likes Bella. James died because Edward saved her and then the family came at the right time and killed James..if you haven't noticed Edward thinks that Alice is way beyond annoying so why would he like her if shes annoying? and no omg Bella doesn't like Emmet. i can't believe that was asked|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	i got a theory      U need a life and got nuthin better 2 do than sit at the computer all day long and make dumb a$$ question.    hey and if u think bout it there could b a sequal like that but ur retarted bcause she likes edward duh!!|`|7lZnHiYZaa	Wow, strangely believe this theory..|`|uSouun2saa	This is utterly absurd. But then again, Meyer would've done something like this if she could get away with it.|`|03DOpyaHaa	She wrote the crappy books the way she did. Live with it.|`|MuCNK2vxaa	I love it. So much better than the actual Twilight series.|`|gnV4nzPzaa	No really, the book isn't meant to be like that. But AWESOME theory!  I started laughing.|`|F0d1bOxgaa	Bella likes Alice because she is nice and has cared for her all the time. She can't be trying to reach Emmett because he is married to Rosalie. She always thought he wasn't as gorgeous as Edward.    Besides she had a BABY with Edward! Did you read the last book? If not go and start! Her name is Reneesme. Meyer would not have done this anyway.... Rosalie doesn't like Bella because she has had a great life and had a choice of becoming a vampire...Rosalie had everything. Have you only read Twilight? They do NOT call on James.    Edward and Alice are close because they understand everyone and they care for Bella the most out of all of them...(Everyone cares for her but them the most)    They have a special bond as well, is that hard to understand? It's like you and your sister or your brother and maybe friend.    Is anyone else mad she isn't writing midnight sun?!?!?!    Good theory but...NO that does not work I am sorry....Good theory though. Maybe read more carefully and you will understand. Have you read all of the books yet or just one?|`|nXxaAH0baa	Wow, I never thought about it that way...so the plot thickens....lol|`|zJoVm4SSaa	ah thats why she arm wrestles him ?lol funny but bella likes esme. so there youre wrong. but that is pretty funny., good one.|`|MQmDYavkaa	That is a completely insane theory through and through.    First of all, I KNOW the Cullens. My ability lets me know what they most deeply desire, and I can tell you now that Alice and Jasper, Em and Rose, Ed and Bella, are the most devoted couples I have ever seen in my long life. None of them are considering the other members of their family any more than sisters.     Alice and Rose and Esme love Bella very much, they are closer than friends, they are sisters. Edward loves his brothers and Carlisle very much also. They are one perfect family, and don't blaspheme, or you will suffer the consequences.    *hiss*    -Heidi|`|1B7oTAOkaa	BLASPHEMY AND SACRILEGE!!!! BELLA AND EDWARD ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN DON'T TEAR THEM APART!!>=(|`|ctByEwkaaa	hahahahahahahaaaa!|`|aAldivPsaa	And then Bella Has Edward's baby, Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Did you even read the last book?!?|`|sZYbf0hcaa	Haha. However, if you read the start of Midnight Sun, things may make a lot more sense...|`|7NiFxZ3faa	LOLLL nice one|`|jf1oPsSeaa	teeheez! nice theory! i never liked the idea of them together anyway! and emmet is always joking and flirting with bella anyway, so i think that they would be like the cutest couple in the freaking world!!|`|6AeiZ3lyaa	Um, what on Earth? I mean ---O-k-a-y....  How would you explain Midnight Sun?   What about Jasper's emotion detections BEFORE Bella came around?  Absurd, but funny.|`|enLLBqHlaa	EDWARD IS NOT IN LOVE WITH ME!   Well Edward is my brother, how can he not be nice to me'? So how are you saying that when it's obvious that my brother is in love with Bella. And Bella loves Emmett? That makes no sense! She loves EDWARD. And how is that if it wasn't for me Bella wouldn't be able to be with my family?   Rosalie stated in ECLIPSE what her problem was with Bella and Bella does not secretly stalk Emmett   This really makes no sense X.X|`|NkjuLwbxaa	um....|`|KxdDeO8Taa	I doubt that's true!!!!!!! But it is a good theory I guess. But I dont think that's wat Stephanie Meyer is trying to tell u in the series|`|XL2vg7eaaa	Ha-ha, this is awesome! But, also, this could never happen. Still, hysterical! mdr|`|aCP9JBXQaa	I do NOT have a thing for Emmett. Alice and I trust each other, so suck it up. Edward and I had a BABY fro crying out loud. Doesn't that tell you that he loves me!? I am so sick of some peoples' theories.|`|xdKF0PNIaa	Oh, Bella only wishes that Emmett loved her the way he loves me! Nothing could ever alter our love for each other!      Last I checked, Alice and Jazz's relationship was fine. Same with Esme and Carlisle. (And i can ASSURE you, Emmett and I are absolutely fantastic!) I think you have it all wrong... sorry!|`|NiiXOUy3aa	ahhahahahhahahah!!  omfg i almost peed in my pants!  NICEE.. gamme a good laugh.

ceBTTCPwaa	Animal Farm is a novella by George Orwell. Published in England on 17 August 1945, the book reflects events leading up to and during the Stalin era before World War II. Orwell, a democratic socialist and a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences with the NKVD during the Spanish Civil War. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as his novel 'contre Stalin'.    http://www.bookrags.com/Animal_Farm    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/af/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/animalfarm/ind...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/A...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Animal Farm is pretty much the best guidebook to teach you what NOT to do when you get into power. Using barnyard animals, it provides over 200 years of knowledge about leadership and power, distilling all of the huge mistakes great leaders have made over time. It is a dystopian (great society gone wrong) parable about the communist revolution in Russia.    There is a great summary which is fun to read at Shmoop on Animal Farm.|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm...|`|p08021V8aa	let me tell you something i had to read that book earlier this year for english and was one of the few in the class that actually read it.

She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.

In context, the murder of the jews was not such a big deal.|`|knvXQDvzaa	I vaguely remember learning about the Batan Death March from the time during the Vietnam War.

The Cambodian killing fields amassed some 2 million, but that's out of a population of 7 million    While the holocaust killed some 6 million Jews, another 5 million others also died. Many were Poles but the dead included dissidents, those woith mental and physical handicaps, gays and Gypsys.

In addition to this 6 million is a big deal and should not be trivialized because other genocides were larger. Saying it wasn't a big deal is a disgusting comment.    Yes there were larger numbers in other countries and regions but that does not mean that the holocaust was not a big event.     One also has to understand that the atrocities committed by the Nazis and Nazi supporters were not just in the ghettos and camps. The Nazis burned whole villages and killed the inhabitants and starved populations. A great number were not Jewish.    The 6 million is a number and should not be used to diminish the seriousness of the event.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	There are/were many, here are some of the worst:    Before 20th Century:  In antiquity there are accounts of entire peoples, tribes and cultures being wiped out on a king's rise to power:  (if you consider the Bible historical) Hebrews in Canaan?  Persians in Greece?  Greeks in Asia Minor?  Alexander in Persia?  Romans in Carthage?  Spaniards in Americas?  English in Australia?    Before and during WWII:  Ottomans in Armenia: 1.5 million in 5 years  Hitler in Europe: 6 million in 6 years    During and after WWII:  Mao in China: 47 million in 8 years  Stalin in USSR: 20 million in 7 years    1960's and 1970's:  Pakistan army in Bangladesh: 3 million in 8 months  Pol Pot in Cambodia: 1.7 million in 4 years    2000s:  Hutus in Rwanda: 1 million in 3 months    Keep in mind, these figures are on the low end and Mao and Stalin's figures are so high because of their idiotic policies more than premeditated mass murder. Seems like people are getting better at it as time goes by, killing more people in less time.

Don't read it.|`|g8K7TPOaaa	Twilight?  duh...|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	Twilight|`|aygUtJ1Raa	Oh, that's simple.  It's called "Hm... let's take the most overused plot ever and make it worse, and type it up on 600 pages, and stretch it out to cover 4 books."    Twilight for short.|`|Aa7dLKntaa	its the twlight series|`|GwL3p0ZMaa	no dont get the twilight fans all riled up please?|`|aAldivPsaa	Twilight. Duh.|`|sZYbf0hcaa	Ha ha I actually laughed when I was reading this.  I can't think of the title but I know that the word "forks" is mentioned in it several times.|`|qRgPA9fSaa	I believe the book you are looking for is the very popular Twilight by Stephenie Meyer = )  It's quite a dark story but fantastic all the same!  The book has also been produced as a movie, still named Twilight     Hope that helps!|`|ZtECjEPyaa	It's called Twilight. It comes in a 4-book series. The girls name that starts with a b is Bella. And yes, in the book the vampire is VERY attractive to Bella especially. Both of them eventually fall in love and at the end of the book, the bad guy james, as you said, comes into the picture and tries to kill Bella. Its a really good book altogether. you should read the whole saga. its a really good collection.|`|dUChouI5aa	um,  1. The guys name starts with 'E'. for Edward.   2. The last name of the girl is 'Swan'.   3. She doesn't actually see his sparkly skin at first.  She becomes friends with him and then start going out and finds out he is a vampire.  Then, he shows her why he stays out of the sun   4. The bool is TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!      I mean, forget the character names. okay. Forget the title of the best book ever.... that is a crime against literature.|`|5dVpkTR7aa	Twilight by Stephenie Meyer|`|AA11763023	Twilight by Stephenie Meyer (no, the first name is not misspelled). And please don't listen to the people who say "It's horrible," or even "It's amazing." It's different for everyone. Some love it, some hate it. Read it and decide for yourself-don't go in with any preconceived notions.|`|1B7oTAOkaa	it was twilight!! her name was Isabella Swan and her bf was Edward Cullen. He's the vampire!!
J6C7zr7Raa	Ok from personal experience, "Part of Your World" is over-used. Alot pf people sing. And because so many people sing it often gets butchered. I would do something like "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". That song is a classic and not done very often. Other options would be "God Help the Outcasts" from Hunchback of Notre Dame,  "seasons of Love" from Rent, or another good one is "You Can't Stop the Beat" from Hairspray (if you do do this song you will have to cut it).    Edit: another good one is "Dancing Queen" from mamma Mia.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Go on YouTube and check out several tunes from the musical My Fair Lady, including Wouldn't It Be Loverly, I Could Have Danced All Night, Without You, and my favorite, Show Me.    Enjoy.|`|rOsOpYhpaa	Easy as Life from Aida is a great song but it's pretty intense.  There's also "The Girl from 14G". It's not techniquely from a show but it's still a musical theatre song (one of Kristen Chenoweth's signatures) and a really incredible peice to show off a voice. The range is huge and it goes through tons of different styles. If you're 14 you could also try something like "Christmas Lullaby" from Songs for a New World (beautiful peice and not actually about Christmas) or "I'm not Afraid of Anything" also from Songs for a New World. "Diva's Lament" from Spamalot is also a great comedy piece. Hope this helps some.    Good luck!!|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Hm..."Memory" from Cats, maybe??  Or...  "Listen" by Beyonce  "Hurt" by Christina Aguilera|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	Disney tunes are over done try I"m Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair from South Pacific (great range and challenging tempo) or get really bold and belt out "I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say No" from Oklahoma.  Have Fun!|`|q3KCDrMAaa	How about "The Miller's Son" from A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC...    I try to stay away from current stuff....
5dVpkTR7aa	Well for me, I loved almost every single part of the book, because I thought it was quite amazing! But I really loved the parts where Wanda and Melanie start to work together, help each other, and where Wanda kisses Melanies love, and she always gets sorta pissed off and comes back inside her/Melanies body, Mind. Make sense?? lol.|`|aAldivPsaa	I love it all. Even more than Twilight! *sarcastic gasp*|`|e18d072e364cde72f131e9f26a7a62b0aa	stephenie meyer is just a fad|`|UEAdAuqbaa	I like the part where wanderer goes into the bathroom by herself and Ian's brother is waiting there and he tries to kill her. :) Very action packed.
J8xRVPulaa	I like B, and i think Jacob should still become a werewolf.    Also, i have to congradulate you on achieving what Stephanie Meyer could not, setting up realistic plot situations.|`|qGuRkpecaa	b|`|ihQM9qYLaa	I'm going to go with A and D. The whole werewolf twist was the only reason I kept reading after Edward left.  ..I can only pick one?? A. Nice twist.|`|5oWnIdrSaa	Well the whole thing is a null situation, because there is no way for alice to see werewolves in her visions.|`|uknqrDZsaa	I think Jacob still be human and Renee shouldn't die. (I adore Renee because she had Bella and Bella makes Edward happy, I know it's sad) Alice should have a vision of Jacob turning into a wolf for the first time and he with Bella. Then they both go out of view and Edward reads her mind and thinks Jacob killed Bella. Bella goes to see Renee in Florida and Edward comes after Jacob. Then they have that epic fight but Alice comes in just before Edward kills James (or vice versa, depends on which Team you're on) because she sees Bella in Florida with her mother. Then Jasper calms them down so Edward could read Alice's mind.|`|evEJxv06aa	b she shouldn't die . and get really really sick and hospitalized.|`|JnSrN3guaa	ithink C, but then Edward sees them together, instead of Alice, and you should explain the "different" reason edward left. [:    good luck!    :D|`|cHxaWW0taa	Well as she's immortal...|`|aAldivPsaa	D|`|OZbZPNTtaa	B, is the best bc in elcipse she see's her mom and aswell as breaking dawn
daza5A4vaa	I'd go for the first.  And the perverted wishes are all the fun (:|`|w3uYxwiraa	Choice one, but I have to say I don't quite get it.  Could be good.|`|g8K7TPOaaa	1 would be more unique,   but 2 might be better. depending on your style of writing|`|cHxaWW0taa	First- Grim reaper not death reaper.     Second- Who summons the grim reaper? That's asking for trouble!|`|aFVzMM5laa	what's a death reaper? You mean like the Grim Reaper?    Okay, I'm gonna say to go with Idea  2.|`|ASwTNY89aa	well if a guy were to have someone who has to do what ever he wants... sounds like he would do perverted things|`|J8xRVPulaa	2) Ample capacity for humor and interesting situations.|`|8d0PhOjEaa	I think the 1st one would be more interesting, because when you think of a death reaper, you think of a guy so it'll be different.  It's a pretty brilliant idea, by the way. Good luck! :)|`|qRgPA9fSaa	I think the girl needs to be summoned,  It makes her seem a little more vulnerable towards her new master and therefore will give you more of an excuse to add emotion to the story. But then again I have no idea what the rest of the story is like so you must make it your own decision.    By the way, as a fellow writer I am pleased to see that you have your head on straight and are not putting your ideas all over the internet!    Hope that helps! = )

Rose, Alina, Rae, Summer, Poppy (I love that name, Poppy)|`|pckuIRhsaa	How about Jamie or alternate spelled Jaime but pronounced the same (not hymie)|`|MuCNK2vxaa	Well some good names in my opinion would be the names:  Kirstin*  Rebecca (Becca)  Leah*  Lauren  Stephanie  Jessica (Jessy)  Jennifer (Jenny)*  Ashley   *are my favorites out of these|`|mRr9TU7Kaa	Rachel   Rose  Haley  Chloe|`|omegLbOAaa	Betty Marie Calloway|`|AOkucu5haa	Lucy Calloway|`|sZYbf0hcaa	Well, you should give her a name of English origin, as Juliet and William are of English origin.

So disturbing, yet so good!|`|aFVzMM5laa	The scariest of King's book to me were Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot, and The Shining. But that is because I read them when I was 14 or 15.  Nowadays, no book can actually scare me, but I still enjoy reading SK's novels.|`|gyTcpbpiaa	I would have to say It, and Pet Semetary.  It was really creepy, and the movie finds you jumping off the couch. Read it, and you will see what I mean.

AS8V9rAFaa	Denmark|`|nGsSpT7Xaa	england or denmark but most likely denmark.|`|49QQBUwDaa	The play is called The Tragical History of Hamlet Prince of Denmark. Open the book.|`|I59iQYzbaa	denmark|`|MbJL7aMRaa	Denmark|`|DvToP5h7aa	Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.    Setting    Elsinore, Denmark, in and around the royal palace.  The play is set in the royal palace in Elsinore, a city in Denmark. The story of Hamlet, on which Shakespeare based the play, dates from the Middle Ages, but Shakespeares version has a Renaissance flavor because of references to events and situations from Shakespeares own time. Directors of stage and film versions of Hamlet have set it in places and periods ranging from Elizabethan England to nineteenth century Europe to twenty-first century New York City, in which Gertrude and Claudius run a high-powered corporation and Hamlets fathers ghost appeared on security televisions in the companys offices. More...    http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...|`|uhchod38aa	It's set in Denmark, but it could be argued that to Shakespeare, every place was like England.
4ieW81HHaa	Pardon the cliche, but that has the sound of silence.    This is a delicious fruit to savor but a little under ripe in my opinion and deserves more attention, more stimuli of the senses. Maybe some more concrete details. As is, it's balancing between show and tell, and could lean more towards the show side.   "The cool and fragrant air has soul-filling qualities," seemed to be in a different tongue compared to the rest of the language, especially in that stanza. What if you started it 'The cool and fragrant air freezes moments . . .' and then end with 'and savoured, filling the soul'? I'm just saying, you know, what if.|`|PDUoC5Zsaa	The picture you are painting is one I see whether reality or dream.|`|Y04GKUIUaa	Very nice imagery, very nice indeed.  especially that third stanza, "hills tumbling over each other"  love that one|`|scTHRYDtaa	It's good|`|WbRuTjmFaa	yes I put everything in my pocket... when I have no pockets I panic..

Please give us more.|`|Jvvbt85jaa	ahhh I love the imagery you used. Very... peaceful and thought provoking at the same time.|`|T0fwqL2baa	Lovely, if forever existed
MsLKIJWJaa	The book:  Ok well the book is way more descriptive than the movie. The book has way more feeling in it and you see in your imagination the type of love that Edward and Bella have for each other. I think the book shows the passionate love they have and it doesn't seem so dry. By dry I mean like there is no feeling no um... real longing for each other. Also it has way more things and it makes more sense than the movie. I liked the book better I kind of felt how Bella felt most of the time and you really see how the story takes place through her eyes. I mean the chick is sort of boring at times and she seems obsessed but she is or seems like a very observational person and she seems to notice more than the rest of the town. I totally recommend the book and the whole series.     The movie:  I think the movie had great scenes. Charlie seems to be funnier and well he has his awkward father moments. Edward seems kind of weird but Robert Pattinson portrayed Edward Cullen very well. Bella doesn't seem to be as clumsy as I imagined and it seems like she just says her lines with no passion or interest in really acting. I don't know if Kristine Stewart did any back ground study on her character but personally she did need a bit more to completely fulfill the ideal Bella character. I do have to agree the science teacher did get a little too much camera time. The movie skipped some good parts like how Bella gets dizzy when they do the blood test. Also I think the meadow scene was no what I imagined. I thought Edward was more beautiful than a diamond and that he was supposed to be all reflective and well in the movie it looks more like body glitter. I didn't feel the love that Bella and Edward have for each other as in the book. I think they needed more passion and well two kisses in the whole movie doesn't seem like real passion for each other. I think they needed to have them kiss sometime when Bella leaves with Jasper and Alice to run away from James. Also I think Victoria was supposed to have more of a red flame hair than a strawberry blonde hair. I did like the movie don't get me wrong it had many funny moments and well some scenes were as how I imagined them but since the movie was done really fast and in a low budget I think it could have done a bit better.|`|cHxaWW0taa	The Bio Teacher got way more screen time in the movie then the books.  (the Director must have known of my unbridled love for him...)|`|Aa7dLKntaa	well they cut out a lot of stuff from the books when into the movie and in the movie there is a part were bella and edward were dancing at his house which was not in the book  also when bella told edward that she knew he was a vampire they did it wrong   umm and yeah theres a lot more  lol hope this helps|`|ctByEwkaaa	there are added scenes in the movie that arent in the book like this one scene where victoria james and laurent kill a random guy on the boat docks. the movie went waaay to fast and they left out ALOT of details. some details that were left out were pretty important too.|`|bM9Y79wHaa	d|`|H6ixrUYLaa	The meadow scene was different in the fact that in the book, it was planned on a Saturday and in the movie, it was just a spur of the moment deal.  Also, they didn't include the scene where Bella faints because of the blood in biology class in the movie.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	in the book when bella finds out edward is a vampire they are in the car and in the movie they are in the meadow|`|AvzMFmscaa	My favourite part of the book was left out;  the blood testing :(  Edward doesn't climb trees in the book either.|`|sYD3CNfZaa	the movie/book  there was'nt a field trip scene in the book  edward wasnt that rude  bella dosent meet jacob or billy till when they go to la push beach they dont meet in the beginning.  bella dosent ditch jasper and alice in the hotel she ditches them in the airport|`|Q9h1s5fBaa	Well first of all they cut out a lot of scenes from the book and they didn't put them in the movie. For example Jacob was not in the movie as much as he was in the book and him and Edward were only in like one seen as opposed to the book they were together a lot.Also Isabella found out about Edward a lot quicker then in the book.When Isabella was leaving her dad because the vampires were chasing them she did not hurt her dad as much as in the book.|`|AA11763023	If i went into minor details it would be impossibly long (ex: cabinets in Charlie's kitchen weren't yellow like they should have been). But that's not the point. Personally, I think they captured the essence of the book very well, and, overall, it conveys the same message and feeling the book does. Read the book, watch the movie, and see for yourself.|`|FIFoGNIxaa	First of all, they skipped many scenes that should've been there!    Second, Sometimes they shortened scenes which I thought was stupid.     Third, they just added some stuff randomly
TdRgGCJPaa	It's great!!!! I didn't read the whole thing though, it seems really great though!!!!|`|MhbQiP4Caa	not bad, not good.|`|TycCeqtaaa	i only read  up to were the little girl started going to ozaka or something bc thats all i saw. maybe send it to me? it was okay considering i dont like third person books. =)
AXTfpyGAaa	As long as that passion remains and you are really willing to work for the things you want from life than very little lies outside your grasp. You keep working on your writing and coming up with your ideas and getting them down effieciently on paper and keep heading towards your dreams, dreams are the things that make the world go around for without them the world would be stuck in despair. Boy I really went philosophical there.   And heads up I still have a notebook from when I was little, like 7 and wrote little stories in it. And by Grade 6 I had written a dozen short stories and for our writing assingment I handed in a 62 pg narrative, that was when I decided I wanted to be a writer. You are definately not too young to start. Particularly when you look at the sports teams and proffesional athletes and realize that they have been training for what they do since they were small. There is nothing wrong with starting young, heck it gives you a few more years to dream.|`|enLLBqHlaa	There is nothing wrong with how you feel. You're already set (at this moment) that you want to become a writer when you're older. It isn't dumb to try writing your own book and age doesn't matter. As long as it's something you have an interest in and enjoy it's fine. (Then in the future you can look back and change some things around, realize where you went wrong, etc.) It is all a learning experience. As you get older, you'll learn more and if you want you can get through High School and go to college and major in English.     If you want it, work for it. But keep in mind it can change. I notice that most people are focused on doing one thing, but they end up thinking of other things along the way. But who knows? You can end up becoming something else but have writing be part of your life. (Like as a side job). Either way although you're thinking ahead of the future, that's like I mentioned where you are set. It can be altered, but keep writing and working hard.     You'll do fine ^.^|`|OrcNz167aa	Go for it! i'm sixteen and i'm doing the same thing as you.  It hard at first when you tell people what your doing but then as you start getting really into it that won't matter to you anymore.  Just you and the words.  If you want it go for it! there should be nothing stopping you from your dream.  Best of luck to you.|`|SST8fAnvaa	no. Nothing is impossible.|`|dppzuH8raa	I'm 14 too, and am an aspiring author, Stephenie-Meyer wannabe. We're 14. Not ambtiotious, we just want to pursue what we like. I got an agent through ktliterary, and am now in the process of having my book published. I've been writing it since I was 13, and as people say it's good. If you're serious about publishing, then check out my link. It's possible; Christopher Paolini did it. Or, if you just want to be read and want fans, go to www.fictionpress.com, get an account, and in 3 days it will allow you to post up a story. You may have not heard about it before. It's a site where you post up your stories, make a profile, and day by day, month by month, keep track of the number of people reading your things, their reviews, and what they think of you as an author.       Check out mine.   Here's the link:     http://www.fictionpress.com/u/651031/Fro...    I put up the story, and according to some e-mails I got, it's like 'your personal Twilight'.

Good Luck!|`|UXuGCgo3aa	Not at all.  Teenagers get published (I'm sure you've heard of Eragon).    Age doesn't matter.  Writing is the only thing you need.  I'm 14, and I'm in a writing class (well, it's a correspondence course that shall give me college credits and a certificate) and even the adults have to pass a skills test to enter.  And my teachers think I'm the best writer since Poe (I'm not being arrogent, but proving a point).  I've had 3 small things published.  It's far from impossible.    Big dreams lead to greatness.|`|ZyJKy9Q5aa	No your totally not dreaming too big!  I have the same dream too!  But don't ever give up when some one says you are!  Plus sometimes dreams do come true!  =)|`|avykSnJMaa	The bigger you dream the better write all you can and you will get all kinds of offers when you get something good just be ready to be turned down not every thing you write will be published.    Don't let anyone tell you it will never happen. The only way it can't happen is if you don't try.    I wish you the best and hope you have great success|`|MeOOUhHkaa	No, never.    Remember, there are MILLIONS of books out there. Odds are if you keep looking hard enough, you'll find a publisher who will publish your work. Don't expect to be accepted right away. Expect rejection letters, but that just means you have to keep sending it off to different editors.    Jk Rowling got rejected a ton of times, and look at her now!    Remember, shoot for the moon, and even if you miss, you still land on the stars :D    Even better. Don't be embarrassed though. If you're good, then say your good.

I didn't get published or anything, but I published it myself on lulu.com. It allows you to publish a copy of your book just for yourself, which is really sweet.

I set my mind on writing my series at the beginning of last year and now am ready for editing my first book, then I want to have it published, and move onto physically writing the second.

Next time you see someone playing a guitar on TV, look at his left hand, the one pushing the strings on the neck.  If he has his thumb curled up over the top of the neck, he is self-taught.  A teacher would always make you push your thumb against the back of the neck.    When you take lessons, well it depends on the teacher, the kind of guitar you're learning, etc., but usually they teach you notes and scales. You learn to read music so you can follow the pieces in the book.  When you learn by yourself you usually learn chords or tablature, and you play chords to songs before you learn to play notes or tunes.  A teacher will make sure you have the proper form--holding the guitar properly, holding your hands in the right position, etc.  Self-taught guitarists (or self-taught -anything-) can make bad habits at first.  But, like the thing with the thumb, these bad habits won't keep you from becoming a good guitar player, or even famous.    Also you probably have lots of friends who play guitar, and they will be happy to come over and teach you a few tricks.  Much of guitar lore is passed on in this way, from one player to another, like videos passed around the Internet.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	you learn basic chords, finger-strength development exercises, basic scales and learning the notes on the fret board  as you progress through the months, you learn about music and chord theory, how to compose your own pieces, more advanced techniques like harmonics and arpeggios, and you learn more advanced chords like C 6/9  you can also learn more about the specific sounds of the guitar  like the Blues Scale has the Diminished 5th, or the tritone  then you move on to the legato, which is another name for sweeps  and you learn tapping, tremolo arm (whammy bar) techniques, etc.|`|e2b1cd36cf9952a8e59f05d59541b96daa	notes, chords, frets, finger-placements, scales, movable pentatonics, songs that you just bring in if the teacher is cool, how to read music, how to tune by ear, harmonics, different picking styles, etc.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	How to skin rabbits. What would you expect them to teach?|`|XOgvpDiZaa	You'll get songs/exercises to help strengthen your weaknesses. For example, if the teacher notices you have a hard time with getting your pick to the correct string he/she will give you exercises to practice to overcome that obstacle. You'll also get songs that the teacher thinks will be good for you.    The teacher will tell you to make a CD of songs you want to learn, and he or she will tab out one song at a time for you and if the teacher's good, he or she won't continue onward until you can fully play the song.    What my teacher asked me was if I wanted to learn notes. I said yes so he told me to get this particular book, then later on he told me to get the complete method book by the same author, which was just a continuation of the first small book. In addition to learning songs and stuff, I get exercises from the book to practice.    A good teacher will tell you to tell him or her if they're moving too fast for you, or too slow so they'll adapt accordingly. You get a lot of stuff to practice in one week (this week I had two songs from the notes book, a song that I wanted to learn, and to practice a picking pattern), but if it's too much then the teacher will gladly cut back.    The teacher is there to help you, and if you have a teacher who's in the local music business-like mine-he or she will ask if you want to record.    There's more to what a teacher teaches you but I'll just sum it up here:  -Different styles  -How to get better at whatever you're trying to master  -How to improvise (if you want to)  -Corrects bad habits|`|UEzTKxwYaa	I didnt learn sh!t when i took lessons, i learn better on my own. since your probably just starting out look up some guitar tabs for songs you like, and watch live musicians play, then you'll start to learn many new chords. then you can make up your own songs. and when you go to a guitar teacher your gonna end up sounding like every other guitar player...
Uzzv4FYZaa	Chancellorsville: Lee's best battle, set the stage for the Gettysburg campaign.  But Stonewall Jackson was killed, a terrible loss to the South.  Fort Sumter: bad mistake by the South.  United the North to repress the Rebellion.  Lincoln re-elected: really bad news for the South.  Meant the war would be fought to its conclusion; no hope of a negotiated peace recognizing Southern independence.  First Battle of Bull Run: a battle of amateurs.  South thought it meant the war was over; North finally woke up to the fact they had a real war on their hands.  Lincoln assassinated: worst day in US history.  Lincoln's policy of conciliation replaced by punitive occupation, leading from military rule and carpetbaggers to the Klan to Jim Crow.  Cold Harbor: last all-out frontal assault of the war.  Still a bad idea in 1864, just as it had been in 1863 at Gettysburg and 1862 at Fredericksburg.  North suffered 8,000 casualties in 20 minutes.    Chattanooga: best chance the South had to capture a Unioin army.  Unfortunately, the South had Bragg and the Union brought in Grant.
AA12343309	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_...    Now, when they assign you to a Haplogroup they base it on your DNA and take you back thousands of years to your nomadic ancestor.    However, it does not mean that all your maternal grandmother's ancestors went back to the Near East.      If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents and there are no duplicates, you are directly descended from 510 individuals, 255 on your father's side and 255 on your mother's side.  It pyramids as you go back.  You got your Mitochondrial DNA from only 8 of those people.  None from your father and it left out 247 people on your mother's side.    You get 23 chromosomes from each of your parents and they are made up of DNA.  Only 1 from each would have your Mitochondrial and if you were a male also your Y.  The other 22 are your Autosomes. They have your Autosomal DNA.   That is the DNA that relates you to your father, your paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather and a lot of people going back.    You get Autosomal 50-50 from both parents but it is not at 25-25-25-25 breakdown coming from your grandparents.  You do get 50% from your maternal grandparents and 50% from your paternal grandparents, but in both cases it is not an even breakdown between grandfather and grandmother.  The breakdown can vary among siblings.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	Mtdna group J (Jasmine) originated in the near east.Around the dawn of agiculture, its bearers began to move into  Europe.

pg47OZ2vaa	Um, a little confused but if you want one that's relevant to history,  Langston Hughes's poems are almost all about civil rights, especially dealing with the inequality between races in America at the time.  "Democracy" is a good example here.    Democracy will not come  Today, this year  Nor ever  Through compromise and fear.    I have as much right  As the other fellow has  To stand  On my two feet  And own the land.    I tire so of hearing people say,  Let things take their course.  Tomorrow is another day.  I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.  I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.    Freedom is a strong seed  Planted  In a great need.    I live here, too.  I want freedom  Just as you.    if you can use song lyrics as poetry, anything by Bob Dylan, but particularly "Let Me Die in my Footsteps" is about the craze of people building bomb shelters in the 50s/60s, fearing Russia was going to nuke us, or "Bye Bye Miss American Pie" which has a whole bunch of references to the passing of the 50s into the 60s (Miss American Pie refering to the cookie-cutter, clean and proper, keeping up with the Joneses mentality of the 50s).      However, it looks like the term you brought up has nothing to do with American history so I'll stop here.  You just said "Whatever you studied in history class" so that's what I have to offer.  *shrug*|`|X2lesqhRaa	"Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening"                  by:Robert Frost  Whose woods these are I think I know.  His house is in the village though;  He will not see me stopping here  To watch his woods fill up with snow.  My little horse must think it queer  To stop without a farmhouse near  Between the woods and frozen lake  The darkest evening of the year.  He gives his harness bells a shake  To ask if there is some mistake.  The only other sound's the sweep  Of easy wind and downy flake.  The woods are lovely, dark and deep.

qk5uuVxcaa	It was going good until the end... then it just fizzled out.  If you are going to build the poem up with a narrative, and this appears to be an anecdotal narrative where a lesson is illustrated, or piece of wisdom is shared, you have to deliver a POWERFUL ending.  One that blows people away. Rain is water.  Big deal.  Everyone knows that.|`|cYNifeZTaa	It's a good read! Write more definitely!! You've got some talent there.|`|q3rDROxgaa	Im so into poem and this poem has more meaning to it then what it seems butifuul poem
ceBTTCPwaa	This novel was incredible. Brunonia Berry does deal with some hard issues like spousal abuse so if you are looking for a light, happy easy read, this is not a good choice. That warning being said, this novel was awesome! THE LACE READER inspires readers to follow with the imagination and go it where it leads. By the end, all the narrative threads and images add up to something spectacular and rich as past and present and landscape, history and the personal all combine. THE LACE READER is a novel built in layers and nuances like a person's life or like the memories in the mind or like the depths of psychology. THE LACE READER has some surprising and poetic twists towards the end. There is no guaranteed happy easily resolved ending --- but the ending has it's own kind of satisfying richness that combines deep emotion, sadness, even trauma into a new beginning and a new sense of freedom. Beautifully poetic!
6ULx1uoBaa	It's possible. But a lot of publishers don't really take anyone under 18 seriously. That is saying generally. But the thing is that many people start writing in their teens and they nurse stories for a few years and develop them into brilliant pieces of work later on. What you have to do is get a literary agent who specializes in the genre of your book. Then the agent will sign contracts with you and help you send your manuscript out to publishers.    So right now, don't really worry about publishing. Finish the story first and then start revision. There's always room for improvement. Writing is not just a one shot snappy thing. There's also writing contests for your age group that could get you published and help you build a good portfolio.    Keep writing and don't give up hope.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	yes it is possible but it will have to be a good book.|`|03DOpyaHaa	Yeah anythings possible. I recommend not telling the book publishing place you decide to go with, if you go traditional, your age. Let them read your story first.|`|aAldivPsaa	yes. You just have to go through the right people. I would get in touch with a publishing house. I just recently read a book by a 14 year old.|`|AOkucu5haa	S.E Hinton began writing "The Outsiders" at fifteen and published it at seventeen.

You can do whatever you put your mind to though. : )|`|qt08rlrAaa	i guess if ur real good|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Course you would be able to, it all depends on how professional you take on the task.  If you write it, and perfect it, then send a manuscript to a couple of publishers, and get yourself an agent.  Go from there.  Maybe call a few publishers though, before you do anything, to inquire on what steps you should take as a 16 year old.|`|zvhZ0Dsoaa	YEs it possible. Research the publishing process on google and you'll learn more there than this site could ever tell you. Do your own hard work or you'll never get there. :D  One thing to keep in mind though is that even though it is possible to publish at your age you will still have to compete with a market that is full of authors twice your age and experience. But they all started where you are and some started later. You've got a head start so go for it and never let a rejection get you down.|`|8yzMjjHqaa	yeah just write your book and give it to your teacher or something and ask if he or she could ask if he or she could submit it to a publisher or you can do it your self|`|pg47OZ2vaa	It is possible.  I don't know if you're looking to publish a short story or a book, but either one's possible.  I don't know much about short story publication, but you basically want to find a magazine and follow their submission guidelines.  For a book, you should first submit to agents.  And yes, you have to put that you're under 18 because they would need to deal with you differently than with someone over 18 because you're not allowed to sign legal documents, your parents would have to, and they like to know that sort of thing right off the bat.      I suggest checking out the book "How to Publish Your Novel" by Ken Achity.  He outlines the steps in a thorough, understandable way.    A lot of agents mention the under 18 issue on their blogs, and the ones that I've found say they're interested, and they'll read the query letter just like they would for someone over 18, but it's very rare to find someone under 18 with writing at the level they're looking for.  Obviously, as mentioned by others here, it's been done and why not give it a shot?  The worst that can happen is they say no and when you're ready with your next novel, you'll know exactly how the process works.    Good luck!

The Circle of Blood by Alane Ferguson.    AMAZING book series. I was really skeptical when I picked up the book, because it's not my usual reading, as it's a murder mystery with autopsy and the 'who done it' type thing, but Oh-My-Word.    I was blown away.    The first book is The Christopher Killer, the second is The Angel Of Death, and the last one, the one I just read, is The Circle of Blood, and the next book will come out this fall, The Dying Breath.    Definitely read it.    "  As the daughter of a Colorado County coroner, seventeen-yearold Cameryn Mahoney is no stranger to death. in fact, shes always been fascinated by the science of it. so shes thrilled to finally get some hands-on experience in forensics working as her fathers assistant. but Cammie is in for more than she bargained for when the second case that she attends turns out to be someone she knowsthe latest victim of a serial killer known as the Christopher Killer.

6ri6UGsoaa	I think you have some potential there, and if this poem's story is something that's actually happened to you (someone loving you in a way you can't return) I've been there. It's painful, but if you did what you did in your poem, you did the best thing you could by being honest about it. I got myself into huge problems because I didn't want to hurt the person's feelings. Honesty, I found out a little late, is the best thing in this situation.     As for the poem itself, like I said, it has definite potential...but I have a couple things to say: first that unrequited love is a very over-used topic for poems. To have success in the poetry business I find that you usually have to try to go on the paths least trodden, if you know what I mean. Secondly, it is not wise to put your poems on a free-access site like this because someone can very, very easily steal it. I'm just warning you. Keep working at your writing!
5dVpkTR7aa	The moral of the book Lock and Key...well I am not sure. I don't know/think there is a moral.

All you need is love." Lol. I hope that helped!    O.K...let me think of who else was in it....I believe...Harriett, Ruby's boss MIGHT of been in the book "This Lullaby" another book by Sarah Dessen. Otherwise, I cannot quite remember, and the only books by her I have read are Lock and Key, This Lullaby, Just Listen, and Someone Like You. (amazing books, btw.)    Sorry I couldn't help more!

Menzel did, however, make a special out-of-costume appearance at that performance, performed her final song, and received a 5 minute long standing ovation.Menzel was replaced by Elphaba standby Shoshana Bean.    Kristin Chenoweth, Norbert Leo Butz, and Joel Grey - After playing Glinda for nine months (not including the years leading up to the Broadway run where she played the role in all of the show's workshops), Chenoweth left Wicked on 18 July 2004 along with co-stars Joel Grey and Norbert Leo Butz. Chenoweth was replaced by Jennifer Laura Thompson.|`|7R1VYuQ2aa	Idina is long gone, she stopped in 2004-2005  its AMAZING!  go!  watch it now!|`|KGj1dxhQaa	the show opened 2003 ish. idina and kristin are gone. the who original cast is actually. there's going to be a movie in the next year though, so maybe they'll be in it. go see it anyway. i saw the 2005 tour and it was amazing!|`|j7o7RsZKaa	ummm... not at all idina menzel is long gone. from the top of my head there has been soshana bean, stephanie j block, ana gasteyer and more|`|LopRWPbjaa	The answer is in the tuna!|`|08kAHLLbaa	No, all the original broadway cast have gone, It was in 2003 when it started. The replacements are great though!|`|0WZI0xULaa	Everyone above is right. But for future reference, Broadway casts do not tour. Touring companies tour. A touring company may retain a cast member or 2 if they are very lucky, but that's about it.  Also, soundtracks are from films. You've never heard the soundtrack from "Wicked". You've heard the cast album. There is a difference, and sometimes it can be enormous.
6ULx1uoBaa	I think writer's block is a figure of our imaginations.  And just a excuse to be lazy because our stories are running out of steam.  I suffer from it quite often and really, "the only way out is through."    My advice is to keep going. Leave those plot holes and errors for later. Stir up some trouble, some chaos, and it'll move the story along. Try to write in a comfortable environment with no distractions and take breaks when needed. Give yourself rewards. If times are desperate, seek help from family and friends. You don't have to do it alone.    So keep writing :)|`|FLfmkNEAaa	Well, if you haven't you could go kiss a guy that might give you some inspiration on a romance if that is what you are writing.|`|Dy7dtKadaa	You may criticize my opinion, but this is how i do it.... smoke weed! It helps, you have to weed out some of the stupid things you think, but great material can be made of it.|`|bUjXBFQiaa	i'm also often plagued with writer's block. sometimes i just stared at my blank paper for almost an hour and all i could write is 'she'...i just advice you keep on writing even if it's in odd fragments. I just finished writing 213 words now and it took me an hour to take that out..it's terrible..but there's no remedy for writer's block but to just write. Write anything that's in your head and arrange everything later on. It won't make sense at first but it would keep your creative juices flowing and the next thing you know, voila! you've already written a paragraph! :)|`|dppzuH8raa	Keep going. Skip to another chapter. You aren't obligated to write a story in chronological order. You can simply skip from place to place, wherever you feel has to be written, or is the easiest or more conviniet. Then, you go back, and fill in the holes.  Being an author myself, I recommend this: make an outline of your idea for your story. Introduce characters, plot, setting in detail. That way, when you get writer's block, you can look at the outline and see what you can do, or what comes next, or what best fits the character to do. Then build on that.|`|7kSkeefSaa	Obviously the main thing you need to do when you have writer's block is to get some sort of inspiration to either start, continue or finish your story. Here are some ways you can do that:    -Put something down.  -Draw out a 'map' of all the different routes your story could take and choose one.  -Skip a little bit in the story, but remember to go back to fill in the gap.  -Write a letter to someone.  -Read something someone else wrote.  -Start in the middle or write just a piece of it.  -Give up for awhile and do something different.  -Take a walk and just think.  -Make an outline.  -Find somebody who likes you and tell them the story. See what they think of it and ask their opinion on parts.  -Take your notes to bed. Read them just before you turn out the light. Leave a notebook and pencil by your bedside. You will wake up at 3 a.m. with a new approach.  -Write. Just write ANYTHING. It helps.    But, sometimes, you simply CANT get any inspiration or motivation to keep writing, and that's O.K. But never delete the story or get ride of it. Keep it. It might now be working out right now, but someday you'll go back to it and be able to write again.
TYzNTT7caa	Too vague. Nylon string? Classical? Steel string? Country? What is a "pretty nice" one?    You want a playable guitar. The best classical guitars are thousands of dollars; a playable one is $300-$500. Steel string guitars are usually a little less expensive ($250-$400) because they are more popular and more likely to be mass produced. Go for ease of action and decent projection of sound rather than fancy looks. The strngs should be far enough off the frets so they don't buzz but close enough so that a barre chord is not difficult for a moderately experienced player.

Cute title.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.    The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.    Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.    Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.     Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.    Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.    You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.    I hope I helped.

However you may search some of the  sites on the following web page for finding the truth:  http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Apollo+...|`|ixUEtbe2aa	The moon Landing? If that's the one, then yes. Things were WAY too smooth and yet there were too many mistakes, too many edited photos. and their take-off. It looked like the pod was jerked up in the air|`|BMxNOJ39aa	No.    The Russians were in a race with us to the moon. They had deep space monitoring capabilities. During the Apollo 11 they are known to have closely tracked the flight and listened to the the telemetry (Voice and data) If the flight was fake WHY DIDN'T THE RUSSIANS SAY SO? Huge. Vast. Big propaganda coup and nothing was said? The landing was real.    "Mythbusters" and several Discovery specials have taken each of the fraud claims and disproved them. The landing was real.    One "witless" (sorry "witness") claims to have seen a soda can in one of the shots. Supposedly it was edited out in later films. So while the TV transmission was going out live, several hundred thousand people had to have seen that soda can. Plus the networks and people all over the world were taping that same transmission. It would be impossible to "edit" all the tapes and for several hundred thousand people (self included) to have missed the can. The landing was real.    One claim is that we couldn't build the Saturn V today so why could we build it in the 1960s? We can't build a Model T today either. To do so we'd have to redevelop the primitive technology and the primitive materials as they don't exist today. The landing was real.    All of the supposed "evidence" is base on NASA photos, transmissions and so on. Let's see, NASA is faking the biggest story of the 20th century and is so incompetent that it makes error you'd not find on a grade B film.Then the conspiracy types use the NASA stuff to "disprove"....Naw. The landing was real    Finally, Clinton was unable to keep secret his sex with an intern. If an act between two people can't be hushed up, how can a fake moon landing? It's been 40 years an nobody as chimed in with "I helped fake it."None of our heroic investigating journalists have produced pictures, tapes or other evidence.|`|zQohPPH9aa	Yes, it seems more logical that is was a fraud, but I don't care either way.  Here are some questions I have.    1) Why in the past 40 years has there not been any other manned missions to the moon...and no plans in the immediate future?    2) Why isn't the stuff like the Lunar Module and American flag visible through a telescope? Sure, Google Earth has a pic of this, but how was this pic obtained?

WS8MvKQAaa	The Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was Mehmed V who ruled from 1909-1918, but the true power was in the hands of the Pashas, with Enver Pasha being the true power behind the Empire. Of course the German military advisers (Otto Liman von Sanders being one) also had an unnaturally large amount of influence for war time allies.
8ygky5g4aa	What type of music are you looking for?  Hip hop, broadway, rock, alternative?    If you are looking for a broadway type song check out something from one of the newer musicals like Hairspray, Rent, Legally Blonde or Wicked.     If you are looking for hip hop try Irreplaceable, Pon Da Replay, the Ketchup Song or anything with a strong steady beat.    Rock?  How about We Will Rock You, Kryptonite, Bring Me To Life, or something by Linkin Park    Get creative, think of movie soundtracks, TV themes etc.  I once choreographed a hip hop tap routine to the theme from the new Mission Impossible movie.    Break a leg!|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Well, it's not exactly recent, but you could do "Pennies From Heaven" by Louis Prima (off the Elf soundtrack). Or, "Right Now" by the Pussycat Dolls.

b0290d0a90d408aaa6b74a3676cb2431aa	"Wild West" costumes were variations of Victorian wear plus Southern Belle style plantation dresses.  You can put together pieces and parts and still be about right.  Believe it or not, the 1980's Laura Ashley style dresses would be just right for your production of "Oklahoma" - if you can find them. Think bright floral pattern with the wide circle gathered skirt. If you can find the long-sleeved version, even better.  This link to ebay USA shows exactly what I mean:  http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-Floral-LAURA...    I just did a search on ebay USA for Vintage Laura Ashley and that's one of the results that came up. The above link is actually the perfect style you are seeking, and I believe if you contact the seller they could arrange to ship to Ireland or UK. Wear that dress with good solid "sensible shoes" that have a good heel for your dance numbers in the show.

XL2vg7eaaa	Read Elmer's Dragon and those other old, but good books. They are written horribly, but all the animals in it portray emotions (if you analyze it deeper than most people would). My favorite animals (methodical) are phoenixes and dragons. If you don't want methodical animals, you could use flamingos, parrots/parakeets, fish, monkeys, or penguins. Those are some of my favorite animals to write about. I always love books set in jungles, rain forests, deserts, or oceans/underwater. You could always just pick a setting, and then choose your favorite animals in that setting.

Foxes are smart. Lions represent power. Pigs represent greed. Owls represent wisdom. It all depends on what characteristics your characters have.    I suggest you choose a theme. For example, animals of the jungle. You'd then be using lions, tigers, elephants, monkeys and others. Just like "Animal Farm" had farm animals.|`|MuCNK2vxaa	wolves, wild cats, or bears. or all three.|`|de3d27f99d21c023ab26f70689450f16aa	are you gonna give me some of the proceeds? try a blue whale, everyone relates well with them|`|ZBIWfaK1aa	If you wanted animals, you would have to consider the personalities people associate with animals.  For instance, if you used a fox, you would know that the animal would be clever and sly, and accustomed to conning other animals to get its way.  Or if you used an owl or elephant, people would immediately think of a wise, elderly animal.  Also, you would probably need to know the setting, because even though it is a fantasy, you're characters have to have a few limitations.  In other words, unless you rationalize it, you wouldn't put a camel in Antarctica, so you would have to generally keep your animals within a certain range - for example, keep a forest animal theme or something.  In this sense, you still will have to do some research just for a little accuracy.      I would love to read some of your works.  Do you go by you're avatar name, or do you have a real name?  Oh, and do you have any suggestions for a wannabe author?  I'm only in junior high, but I'm working on a story right now.

The jack rabbit, Brother Mottrey, is clothed in nothing but a simple robe, hiding the shining scimitars he had happily put to use over the last couple seasons.

Fy4s0dAkaa	Hi!  Look here:  http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/riv...
d1U9JIvtaa	Both of those careers are high demanding of your time and your attention, and neither should be approached half-way.    It is possible to have acting as a career on the side or a hobby, but not if you really want to master the craft and approach it professionally.    Medicine is a very long course and requires you to be very focused and disciplined. I am not saying you aren't these things, but having to go to auditions or doing acting jobs is not conducive with being a good doctor or medicine student.    So, yes it is definitely possible but to be honest, not advisable as you will probably not succeed at either because the attention is split.|`|Ch3RIAykaa	Yeah, if you act in Scrubs.|`|JfT65q88aa	You've already allowed your self to fail by giving your self a "back up" plan that happens to be a 6 figure career. You can't just do acting on the side and expect to get anywhere.    If you want to be an actor you have to get your priorities straight. First of all, acting is your number one priority. Your second priority is a flexible part time job that will supply you with a livable income.    You need the flexibility to audition, go to callbacks, rehearse, go to lessons, in case you get booked for a 6 month or year contract, and do everything else that's required to be a working actor.    You must understand that acting is a way of life. You won't be rich right away. In fact, you'll be poor most the time and get sick of it. If you need a secure income to be happy, don't even give acting a shot because it won't happen for you. There are thousands of committed people who start to act each year who have dedicated their life to acting. And if you play your cards right, acting will make you a LOT more money than a doctor ever will.    If you're thinking about being a doctor. Do that.
iNXqiDIYaa	there is a lengthy article in wiki which is probably not what you are looking for but near the foot it lists "references" including many books on just this topic    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_...    if Brown's "research" is of the same standard as his writing it will be a load of junk.

GRANw6FWaa	I am interested in the rest of the story but well, I did find a couple of sentence errors I think that we should look into. First off, I think that you would be able to keep the interest with your prolouge if you add a paragraph at the beg. of the letter about her sitting down, a little tense. If you add another paragraph, seperated from the letter, I think you should mention that she is/was crying because she just basically decided to give up her child for a little bit. Keep in mind critisism is always lovely. ^^    * Not that I regret having six children, its just hard providing for them all at once!    *I want to provide everything for them but you see the family is at a financial difficulty now that I just get laid off from work. //// This sentence isn't properly written because "now that I just get laid off from work"... isn't the right combination of tenses. I'll leave it to you to correct, based off of what you think is right, but if you don't understand what I mean I will write it out. Ex. Now that I've got laid off of work..    *My eldest daughter, Myra, just keeps on demanding for things she deemed important, not at all understanding how hard it is for us. ((You could put a comma or a collon for that spot I corrected.)    *Shes already sixteen but Mia seems way mature than her. Well, thats understandable though since Mia is forced to grow up. >>>>Combine these sentences to make them flow together rather then stand unsuccessfully next to each other. "Though Mia is sixteen, she's very mature for her age because she's been practically forced to grow up with our financial situation and all."    The rest of the letter seems very rushed for a letter and I think that maybe you should try to write a little bit more about the financial problems or how Mia has been affected by it- less clothes then her friends, getting a shower every few days instead of each night, etc.    *Poor kid. I wish I could provide for her needs but you see, my own childrens needs should come first and that alone is already a threat to my sanity|`|MuCNK2vxaa	I enjoyed it. I really want to know who Myra and Mia are and what will happen to them. It definitely compels me to read the rest. (If I could!) Keep writing.|`|Oa8KgPp7aa	the get should be a got and i dont think mature was used correctly in the sentence.     but great job overall :]|`|lZiwWAjkaa	i'd read the rest of the story :)    sounds good to me good luck|`|T0ftnyb4aa	The letter seem good. No offense but, we need more background than that. I mean it is a good beginning. But if it was more detailed, it would be better.|`|ViKjojK0aa	Just, less exclamation points.
zeu9ftogaa	I recently found out that you can download books for free from your local library's website.  You have to have a current library card, and a pin number.  With my library, you're only aloud to keep the download for 3 weeks and then you can't access the file anymore.  I downloaded a book that I had to read for work and it was pretty easy.  So go to your library and ask the librarian for help.|`|DxhSIwl7aa	Dude Just go to my site http://619safeer.webs.com/ it will tell you how to get free stuff and it really dose work try it|`|WshwHtk9aa	I hope you mean non-copyrighted books and non-copyrighted recordings.    Reading, streaming, or downloading copyrighted books free online is typically illegal. Unless you are paying for the download or the author has given permission to post the work online for free (and most have not), I wouldn't go near it. Even when the book is in the public domain, the recording may not be. And taking copyrighted work IS STEALING.    Book publishers are tracking illegal downloads and online viewing and are suing people (like the record industry has been doing). They are hurting in this slow economy and they are really not happy that people are stealing their product. Trust me, DO NOT download ANY free songs, books, audiobooks or anything for the next few years (I mean, you shouldn't ever do it anyway for copyrighted material, anymore than you shouldn't steal a TV, but you're just asking for extra trouble now. Of course, maybe your parents have $20,000 they're just waiting to throw away on legal defense, but if not, grow up and buy the books legitimately).    I should probably also tell you that publishers are starting to patrol sites like these looking for copyright violators. Some copyright holders even pay a percentage of winnings to people who turn in those who engage in illegal activities like this.
G4a8Yfjeaa	I'm going to start taking ballet soon, too! :D well what I'm doing is doing the stretches in this video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVq9nL_tL...     to develope more leg flexibility, and doing what I can in this video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu9Sq1Rvu...    also for flexibility. Whatever poses you choose to do you should do for at least 15 seconds. I try to go for 60-100, but that's because I have a tendancy to push myself to the limit. But don't stress your muscles out because then you'll have to give yourself time to recover and that is a waist of time. good luck!! :D|`|0aEYjVzMaa	you need to stretch your muscles a lot.  start by holding on to something, such as a table or dresser.  slowly press up onto your toes.  you should feel a good stretch in your calf muscles.  then slowly press down.  this helps to lengthen your calf muscles, and it's a good stretch.  also try and slide down into the splits.  it's fine if you can't go all the way there, just be careful not to push it.  you can also get some simple exercises and ballet moves from books and off the internet.  good luck!|`|Bx6xTLRbaa	Stretch your muscles daily. Every muscle! Warm up, stretch, work out (dance), cool down, stretch |`|C5N65A8zaa	omgsh. okay. first work on your flexibility. BIIIIG time.  also try and build up your inner thigh muscles. uhh work on your core muscles too, those are the main business in ballet. make sure your posture is really good. uhh pretend that you have a stick through you from your neck to your hips. and you have to stay as straight up as you can. that is extremely good for barre work. also your turnout. try and point your feet but turn your leg out at the same time. if this made no sense. im sorry! ha basically just get your muscles ready.
iHtskXisaa	Dude, there is no number.  If you don't understand this, you're not a writer.  "As many as needs to" IS the correct answer.  I wrote one published piece in two drafts and a polish - and that was a 300+ page piece.  I also did about 30 different rewrites on one 40-page essay.  It depends.  Accept that, or you'll never make it.    Edit - There really is no average.  Trust me on this.  Trust anyone who writes for a living, anyone who has published any book - nonfiction or novel.  You might get it done in a few drafts and have it crisp, clean, and perfect.  Or you may have to do it again, and again, and again.  I promise you (and take this advice as well-meant and freely-given) there is no average.|`|ouUVmrNWaa	When you ignore the obvious answer you misunderstand what writing is about other than pulp or other types of rubbish.  Don't write if you don't Have To !!|`|FLfmkNEAaa	I went through 8 in my book that consists of 492 pages. If it was any longer than that I would have gone through 9|`|qn9NilP3aa	I'm going to go with Nickolas. There is no magic number as to how many drafts lead to a finished product. Some people will do 5 drafts of one piece and then are comfortable, other pieces could have 50 drafts before an author is ready to call it a finished product.    "As many as it needs to" is correct.

Smith.    - Any Anne Rice book    When you said your reading "Jinx" are you talking about the one by Meg Cabot? If not read that it's an awesome book!!

PlkU4Zghaa	Is it the same person as Tupac Inca? (r.1463-14710)? The extent of my knowledge is that he largely expanded the Inca Empire. Before his rule the Incas were largely confined around Cuzco in Peru, but he managed to expand control through modern Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador. This was a period of stability and relative power for the empire. The subsequent Sapa Inca Huayan Capac also expanded up to Quito but died and the struggle for the throne (War of Two Brothers) coincided with the arrival of the Spanish.     Sorry bit or ramble there. The best site for any good in depth info about the Incas will be on JSTOR. Here are some refs I've used in the past, though they are a bit more closely tied to the Spanish conquest, but still worth a try.|`|LKssEG59aa	I think thats a title, it means High-born Inca
TrbzmQAhaa	This question has nothing to do with Books and Authors.   The word is spelled "rumor".   The names of people, as well as the beginning of all sentences, are capitalized. This includes your "i  There is no word "wanna". Your words expressing desire are worth saying in completeness. You "want to" see their MySpace page, and you don't (learn to use the apostrophe if you are going to utilize a contraction) want to mail to them.   If they are on tour, and again, if you wish to utilize a contraction, the word is spelled "they're" on tour.   Your sentences run on without proper punctuation. There should be a period, or at least a semi colon, at the end of your message and before the "Thank you". Also, there needs to be an ending between "to see them" and "i really like them".

EaKetFiuaa	Of course refurbished is good and you should not be concerned. It just means that the item that you bought was previously owned and the camera, in your case, was returned for what ever reason. In order to sell the camera to someone else it must have the same standards as if it were new. The camera should work like new, the only difference between a new and a refurbished camera is the price. Refurbished stuff is cheaper! :)|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Depends on who refurbed it I would say... most of the time the manufacturers do the refurb...  but either way adorama will give you a limited warranty so you should be ok|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	Everything I've heard about refurbs has been good.

The base warranty on refurbished cameras from Adorama  is  3 months versus 1 year on new... however, if you purchase a MACK warranty, you bring the warranty to 3 years, so you actually have a longer warranty than with a new one - and a Refurb item will have been checked by the manufacturer by hand, very thoroughly.     If you've only just bought it, you can probably still get the additional warranty.    I have to disagree with another poster; not all refurbs are really pre-owned. Many Adorama reurbs are ex-demos used in-store etc, which means they've been in a secure, protected atmosphere prior to being refurbished. Or, a refurb could be an item sold but found to have a factory fault - so they get returned to the manufacturer immediately, and you get an unused camera.    BTW I know for a fact that all the equiment sold by Adorama is factory refurbished - so, it could actually turn out to be more dependable than a new item - which will only have been checked by a process of systematic quality control protocol!|`|hUP6bkcPaa	Refurbished normally means to take something old and kinda turn it into something new.... so yea its a good thing? consider looking the word up on dictionary.com or something?

Definitely convince your dance teacher to start teaching it because Disney has stuff for ballet dancers!  They also have shows for jazz, couples, and tumbling/hip hop. There are tons of shows for just about anything, especially if you can sing, too!  Hope this helps!|`|eJMOGeRraa	That depends in the show you are in. Sounds like ballet can be an advantage to you.

In Magic Kingdom, they do shows in the Cinderella Castle. Most of them are princess-related, so it's all like ballroom dancing type of stuff. In MGM, they have some High School Musical Parade, which I guess it would be hip hop in a way. Back in Magic Kingdom, they have other parades around the park, where the characters just walk around the park in a dancing type of rythm. I'm not really sure what their style of dancing would be called. Hope this helped :)|`|Gc08POCYaa	disney is more of a character type of dance, obviously. more fun than technical[:      and you can also audition for Disneys cruise ship! but you have to be 18..

Without heating, you can take glass beads others have made and do necklaces, bracelets, ear rings, etc.  You can do wire wrap jewelry with glass "stones" others have made or by tumbling pieces of glass in a small rock tumbler to make so-called "sea" or "beach" glass.      You can do diamond point etching on glassware to make pictures or do it on flat glass used with stained or beveled glass    You can do stained glass sun catchers with foil or lead.  You will need a reasonably substantial soldering iron.    With a proper torch, you can make glass beads for use above or sale.  www.hotglass.com    With a proper kiln, you can make small fused glass pieces for jewelry or larger ones to sag into decorative bowls or sculpture. www.warmglass.com    http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/what-c...|`|TfLPRwFWaa	sure! glass sculpting.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	OF COURSE!!!    lots of things....|`|KF48OjyDaa	ceramics are glass, stained glass, blown glass if you have the skill to do it|`|FBywNyw8aa	yup blown glass looks awesome ^_^|`|aBWT7SbMaa	can a boat not not float?|`|hjzH1lFmaa	ya sher can hunay!|`|7xQIDDQRaa	I've never tried

x38sIvyxaa	Hmm. Interesting, but I don't think that I believe it.  I don't believe that Wormtail ever loved anyone but himself. He had absolutely no self-confidence, and loving someone usually promotes self-confidence. He joined Voldemort to gain protection for himself; if he had truly loved Lily and been a Gryffindor at heart, he would never have gone over to the 'Dark side'. (Yes, it's true that Snape went over, but he returned as soon as he found out that Voldemort had targeted Lily.)   Wormtail was a coward. He intended to betray the Potters from the moment he became their Secret-Keeper. If he'd loved Lily, he would never have given the information to Voldemort, because he would have realized that her own life would have been forfeit.  And as for the fact that Voldemort offered Lily the choice to step aside, it was because of her intelligence. She might have been a 'Mudblood', but she was a remarkably talented witch (even in Voldemort's eyes). I think he would have offered her recruitment if she'd stepped aside docilely. I'm almost certain that it had nothing to do with a bargain between Wormtail and Voldy.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	you got it wrong. Snape loved Lily but hated James. Snape bargained for her life and since Snape was one of Voldy's man, Voldy did it as a favor. Peter was just sad that he was going to have to kill one of his best friends but peter had to do it in order to survive. Peter chose the "winning side" at the time.|`|zWdKGLzbaa	Snape is the one who's in love with Lily, not Peter.|`|vFK8AjMcaa	Yeah, it is Snape.|`|6PbyKpHzaa	Voldemort didn't want to kill her because he promised Snape he would have Lily.|`|BOKyHQUhaa	Wow. That probably has to be on of the closest theories of someone who hasn't finished the series yet.  Although, I think that if Peter, someone who wasn't in his inner circle, had asked, he probably would have killed him on the spot. Also, I think we've all seen that a) Wormtail is a coward and can barely speak to Voldie without stuttering, b) Voldemort doesn't seem to value Wormtail's opinion very much, and c) what woul dhe have to bargain with in the first place?  Hope this was helpful. :-)|`|x4p5eMq0aa	It was Snape who told Voldemort not to kill Lily.|`|swigidUeaa	no, that's a dumb theory. Snape didn't want him to kill her, cause snape loved her. And peter was friends with james sirius and remus for 13+ years.|`|7hfbQTxjaa	i suppose it is a possibility, but it was Snape who asked voldemort not to kill lily. i think peter was just a coward though. though i do like your theory, it makes sense.|`|005b9d937f89063d9351dfdb68b24f2faa	Peter was kind of a loser and wanted to belong.  As a result when the Maurders let him hang around he took their abuse.  Same thing with Voldy, he wanted to belong to a group where he felt like he was important.  When you read the last book you find out that Snape is the one who asked Voldy to spare Lily because he loved her, and had since they met as children.|`|aBh7uZkuaa	no actually i read all the HP books and reread some of them. peter betrays them but it was snape who loved lily and hated james and sirius. But the reason 'voldy' didn't kill lily at first was because snape asked for voldy not to kill her but he did anyway.so basically you mixed up peter and snape.|`|phH2dVYZaa	Honestly I don't think so I just think Peter's a coward >.    He loves his mother, I suppose.|`|HHzjzq4Zaa	In harry potter everyone has theories and i think this is actually a good one.Everyone knows snape loved lily but so did many other ppl he's not the Only one.Even lupin admitted there wad just something special about her.But to be honest its kinda weird if u think about wormtail and lily together *shudders*  But ur theory is good  and i think its right weird but right

After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.

38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	Actually, you don't submit to a publishing house. You submit to agents.    Before you do anything, you should edit your manuscript. Edit it a lot. Have other people edit it as well, get their feedback. You're going to need to make a lot of changes. No one's first draft gets published.    Then research agents. Use AAR as a reference. Find agents who agent for your genre. I'd suggest a list of at least ten agents before you actually submit anything. Before you add an agent to your list, know at least (a) what they have represented before (b) who they represent now (which other authors use this agent) and (c) what genre they represent.    Now you need to write a query. Your query letter should be a brief summary of your novel. It should be catchy. It's what's selling your novel to this agent. If you can provide a personal reference to the agent (like 'I read your blog' (make sure they have a blog before you say this, and do read their blog if you say this... agents don't like it when you lie to them) or 'I met you at x-y-z conference' (again, make sure you really did meet them at x-y-z conference. Agents remember these things)). You should also have any prerequisites listed, like 'I was published in x-y-z magazine.' (again, don't lie.)     When you mail your query, make sure you include a SASE with the correct ammount of postage, so the agent can respond.    If you get rejected, don't be too disapointed. It doesn't mean that your writing sucks. It just means that the agent's list is full, they personally don't like the book enough to sell it, or it's just not right for them.    Avoid people who have upfront fees, such as reading fees or shipping-and-handling fees. These are usually scams. This means that Lulu, iUniverse, CreateSpace and all self publishers aren't real publishing credits.    Good luck!    ~Alice|`|iHtskXisaa	None of them.

It depends on what has been on my mind and such. You let your feeling show when you draw and that is a good thing. It could take you far as an artist!
S4Bqb7TWaa	Once we begin building concepts, there are almost by definition something from either our own imagination or that of others.  As for giving a purpose to our being, I think it depends on just what concept of self we take on, but I think often any effort to define oneself will either ascribe or imply a purpose that fits the definition.    And, many people considered "insane" are the most coldly calculating logicians one might imagine.  Logic is a system of building on premises; one can disagree vehemently with the premises of a person, to the point of calling his or her mindset "insane," but that doesn't mean the way of building on those premises is necessarily illogical.|`|m5rkpk1Daa	Self-awareness constitutes existence.|`|UyrYakUlaa	If the idea of your self is only your idea, then it is still YOUR idea, which means you exist to have an idea of your existance.

Everything we know is controlled by our mind, so if someone controlled our mind then we wouldn't know the difference.    It's been proven by the recent Brain Machine interfaces that it is possible for us to control Rats mechanically, create an artificial signal that stimulates the rat's mind and tells it to release dophamine, giving it the feeling of satisfaction.

Her features obviously come from her MOTHER'S side, which is the same side you share, and which you also have taken after.

Bgqi0pOuaa	The story takes place from October to December, 1960.  There's a halloween bat decoration above McMurphy's head when he comes on the ward, and talk of the holidays toward the end of the novel.    It was written from 1960-1961 and there was talk about the Yankees being in the World Series, which they were in 1960...so I assume Kesey used the current date as the setting.    Don't get confused by the movie in which Jack Nicholson starts going off on Sandy Koufax while pretending to watch the World Series on TV.  That would be the 1963 series, but this is never mentioned in the novel, as it would be impossible for Kesey to predict who would be pitching in a World Series that hadn't happened yet.

Different people judge this differently.  If I lost a paperclip and got upset over it and spent a hour looking for it--most people would consider the paperclip trivial.  There is not unified, commonly accepted standard to decide what is trivial.    More importantly is that your girlfriend was saying that the issue was important to her but not to you.  That puts you in a bad position; it says to her, you don't care about her feelings.  You seem more interested in proving your case.      Stop worrying about who is right.  Worry more about keeping your girlfriend.  If she keeps thinking you don't care about her feelings, it won't be long before she starts looking for someone who will.    And, by the way whether something is life threatening does not decide if it is trivial.  It just determines if it's life-threatening.  There are a lot of things that don't threaten your life that are nevertheless NOT trivial.|`|AA11488628	something that doesn't mean a lot to a person. otherwise saying it might not be important to you but it is to me.   nope as far as i know it is just perspective that would make something trivial. though the dictionary gives trivial a definition of being commonplace; ordinary.|`|q6phm94caa	Being bitten by a mosquito is a triviality, whilst confronting a herd of charging elephants is not.

WLizHwtkaa	Get hold of a book called "One Palestine, Complete" by Tom Segev (ISBN 0-8050-6587-3). It describes the history of Palestine from the end of Ottoman rule after WWI up to the creation of the State of Israel by the United Nations in 1948.    You will discover that Israel was created primarily by Zionists, an almost fanatical Jewish faction containing what today we would call terrorists. From the moment the Ottoman Turks were expelled the Zionists began manipulating politics worldwide to create a Jewish State in Palestine. Britain was given the mandate to rule Palestine by the League Of Nations (a forerunner to the United Naions) only because it was the British who, at the end of WWI, pushed the Ottoman Turks out of Palestine. So the British were already there.    The British had little interest in Palestine, beyond wanting to hold it to stop the French getting control. Everyone (except the Zionists) wanted the United States to have the mandate, but the US retreated back behind it's isolationist shell and the Zionists got what they wanted. The reson they wanted the British, who tried hard to be fair to both the majority Arab population and the minority Jewish and Christian populations, was because they [the Zionists] knew that they'd be able to manipulate the British who would do anything to avoid appearing to be unfair to either side.    The Zionists vehemently opposed democracy for Palestine (which the British favoured) at the start because there was an Arab majority and they'd never vote for a Jewish State. Instead they manipulated Britain and the US to increase the immigration of European Jews into Palestine as fast as they could. Their aim was to get a Jewish majority and then demand democracy.    The Jews never considered the Arabs as equals. And they still don't. European Jews considered themselves civilised and the Arabs to be nomads with no rights to the land (or anything else). At no point did the Zionists ever genuinely attempt to integrate the Jewish and Arab populations. Their goal was always a Jewish State that occupied the whole of Palestine. The Arabs were, to them, just an annoyance.    The League Of Nations, in 1948, voted to create the State of Isreal, but within borders that were much smaller than the Zionists wanted. It did not occupy the whole of Palestine, because the League Of Nations also wanted to leave the Arabs a homeland (Britain had, under the Mandate, promised the Arabs independence in Palestine too).    During the six-day war in 1967 Israel occupied that part of Palestine that the Zionists had always wanted but which was outisde the agreed international borders. Israel is still illegally occupying those parts of Palestine (Gaza, the West Bank, West Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) which they took by force in 1967.    So the answer to your question is that yes, Israel is a legitimate nation, just like any other (though it's origins are far from honourable). However, Israel is also occupying land that belongs to Arab countries, land they have taken by force and land that they will not leave.    It is the illegal occupation, rather than the existence of Israel as a nation, that is the cause of the conflics today. Israel does not want to give up land she considers should have been hers to start with, and so, to defend her illegal occupation, she twists the knife of the ancient "debt" that the world believes they owe to the Jews, and claims that the conflict is about Israel's right to exist. It's not. It's about Israel remaining behind her internatuonally agreed borders whether she likes it or not.|`|el8yX5q3aa	http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/6...    HOW ISRAEL BECOMES A STATE    The land of present-day Israel has been invaded, conquered and re-invaded since Biblical times.   1250 BC: Israelites began to conquer and settle the land of Canaan on the eastern Mediterranean coast.   961-922 BC: Reign of King Solomon and construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon's reign was followed by the division of the land into two kingdoms.    586 BC: The southern kingdom, Judah, was conquered by the Babylonians, who drove its people, the Jews, into exile and destroyed Solomon's Temple. After 70 years the Jews began to return and Jerusalem and the temple were gradually rebuilt.    638 AD: Conquest by Arab Muslims ended Byzantine rule (the successor to Roman rule in the East). The second caliph of Islam, Omar, built a mosque at the site of what is now the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem in the early years of the 8th Century. Apart from the age of the Crusaders (1099-1187), the region remained under Muslim rule until the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the 20th Century    Go to this site above and it tells you the whole story up to and past WWII    The Jews had it to begin with...and it just kept being fought over ...it is thousands of years of hatred and fighting...and YES it is a legal country.|`|AA10405801	A portion of the land area called Palestine was divided bt the British, who were in charge at the time.  The best part of the land was given to the Arabs and the worst part was offered to the Jews.  The Jews accepted the land and the Arabs rejected the offer and started a war to murder all the Jews in the middle-east.|`|0QJnCLssaa	Israel was created after a long tension in between the Jews and the Arab/Muslims. During WWII many Jews migrated to the middle east, and Palestine (which was a country at this time), because of Hitler's perfect race. Then with this large majority, and the growing tension, (and strong US influence) the UN decided to declare that Palestine was going to be split into two nations, Israel and Palestine.     However, as soon as Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, many Arab nations, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Jordan attacked Israel. After defending itself during this war in 1948, and two other wars in 1967 and 1973 the Palestinians had lost their country and mostly forced into Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Israel is a legitimate country, it is recognized by all nations and the UN.     However the question of whose land they are on is a difficult one. The palestinians had it before the Jews and the UN took it over, and the Jews also stem from this region, meaning that they have also lived in the area for a very long time. For the most part, Israel, who is strongly backed by the US, will be around for awhile, while the Palestinian Authority continues to claim area in the West Bank and controls Gaza. The P.A. is the country holding another country's land. The area has been contested over since the beginning of time, and will continue for many more years.|`|5VqxkMFuaa	In 1947, the area that until then had been under the "British Mandate for Palestine" had about 1.5 million inhabitants, roughly two thirds Arabs and one third Jews (the Jews minority was concentrated in some particular areas, where they were indeed the majority, but not over the entire Palestine). Resolution 189 of the United Nations (strongly opposed by the Arab countries) sanctioned the partition of "Palestine" into two states. one essentially Jewish, the other essentially Arab. Then war broke out, a year later Israel declared unilaterally its independence, and when the dust settled there was a Jewish state and a very large displaced Arab population (about 750,000 people) living in refugee camps.    These discussions get very heated and controversial for many different reasons, depending on which side one supports.     The UN resolution indeed establishes the legitimacy of Israel, but the people on the losing side of that argument feel that the UN had no right to give away someone else's land. To them, it is a bit as if a UN resolution (supported by, say, China, Russia, North Korea, and Luxembourg and opposed by the US), sanctioned that some part of the US Southwest should be given back to native American tribes because they lived there before the white settlers arrived.    To make things even more complicated, after more Middle East wars, the situation today is that state of Israel is indeed established more or less in the area assigned to them by the UN resolution. However they also occupy or militarily control the West Bank, where a number of Jewish settlements have been built. So, in that sense, Isarel is also an occupying country. And finally, the Arab part of Palestine never came into being, so there is a population of about 1.5 million Arabs without a homeland, with a lot of bitterness and grievances.|`|AA11304025	It's a long story but basically it was a group of extremist European Jews in the 19th century called Zionists who claimed that their sky god had promised them the land over 3,500 years ago and therefore they should all be allowed to return there in the 20th century even though the land had been occupied peacefully by many other races since then and was now called Palestine.  After the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 , Palestine was administered by the British who allowed in a small number of jews.  This increased year by year until  by the 1940s they felt strong enough to form terrorist gangs and attack the British Administration and the local Christian and Muslim Palestinians.  They carried out many atrocities , killing thousands of people and in 1948 the British gave up and handed the problem to the UN who made the worst decision ever and decided to split Palestine into a jewish zone and an arab zone even though the jews were a minority in every part of Palestine except Jaffa and the population was not allowed a democratic vote on the proposal..  In May 1948 the jewish terrorists declared the State of Israel and attacked the Palestinians forcing 700,000 survivors to flee for their lives to refugee camps where they have been ever since.  Since then the jews have increased their territory by military action and now occupy a part of Jordan ( the West Bank) and part of Syria (the Golan Heights) where they have built illegal settlements in contravention of UN Resolutions.  Their official policy is to eliminate all non jews from the land that they claim as given to them by their sky god.  Only jews can be full citizens of Israel.  They still have some way to go before they reach their objective so a lot more people will die in the future  For more information go to www.palestineremembered.com

I59iQYzbaa	from wikipedia, read it over it is right     The vampire coven known as the Volturi resides in Volterra, Italy. They are regarded as "royalty" by other vampires because they have lived for well over three thousand years and act as police, enforcing the rule that the existence of vampires be kept a secret from humans. They often send others to travel from Volterra to prevent overzealous covens and renegade vampires from exposing their species. They are guarded by several powerful vampires who have been collected for their powers and skills. Carlisle once stayed with the coven as a guest, but left due to his desire to avoid harming humans and created his own coven in the United States. At the end of New Moon, the Volturi discover that Bella, a human, has learned of the existence of vampires, and demand that she be made into a vampire as well, or else be killed. In Breaking Dawn, the vampire Irina goes to the Volturi and warns them that the Cullens have created an immortal child after seeing Edward and Bella's daughter, Renesmee, hunting not far from the Cullens' house. The Volturi coven proceeds to Forks to destroy Renesmee, but leaves once they realize that she is not a threat.  The Volturi leaders consist of Aro, who can read every thought a person has ever had once he has made physical contact, Marcus, who senses relationships, and Caius, who has no known power. Aro's wife, Sulpicia, Caius' wife, Athenodora, and formerly Marcus' wife, Didyme, who had the power to make others happy, also act as leaders.[7] The Volturi guard consists of 32 members, including Jane, who creates illusions of pain; Alec, who is able to cut off the senses of others; Demetri, who can track anyone once he has the tenor of their mind; Chelsea, who can change emotional bondings; and Renata, who can make anyone feel distracted and wandering when they are near her (classified as a "shield"). The majority of the Volturi remain nameless throughout the series. There is also a human secretary named Gianna who appears in New Moon. Despite her hopes to become a vampire, she is killed by the Volturi by the events of Breaking Dawn.[8] The Volturi have invited Carlisle, Edward, Alice, Kate, Benjamin, Zafrina, and Bella to join them, though all have refused.

It has huge coal, gas and mineral reserves, plenty of timber, fresh water and farmable lands. On top of that Britain's population size has always been competitive with Germany and France. The fact that it was, unlike it's continental neighbours, an island, meant that it built up a legendary naval tradition. This allowed it to build up a vast overseas trading empire, which made Britain the richest country in Europe. The fact that the Industrial Revolution started in Britain didn't hurt either.|`|iJgwxncgaa	I would look  up such people as Dr John Dee,and read about the mentality of the people.Our power came from the ships and people who sailed them|`|A3RU9L1Raa	precisely by being an 'island nation'..a strong tradition of maritime trade and conquest..in the same way a city state called rome rose to domin8 the mediterranean.. or the 'vikings' from norway and denmark roved the seas and invaded france or deep in2 russia.

Thus, with this spur of confidence, the British were inspired to form a powerful navy, which they accomplished and thus dominated the seas and became a powerful colonizing nation.|`|DjHWw3h3aa	coz were just naturally fantastic|`|VIM4XmYNaa	Britain has dominated the world for many reasons, the main reason being naval power.  Britain is an island, therefore their navy is key.  Britain grew its navy so vast and powerful that nothing could stop it.  Because of this naval power, Britain was able to quickly and easily expand its reaches to colonies all across the world, increasing their wealth, power, and prestiege.  As they say, "The sun never sets on the British Empire", because Britain had colonies in every time zone.  Another reason Britain is so powerful is because of the defenses provided by being an island.  Any attacker would have to attack by sea, a very foolish decision to make due to Britain's unstoppable navy.  I would say Britain dominated rather than Iceland because of Britain's great leaders, they knew how to dominate the world, and they executed this plan with perfection.|`|xE8orz6Daa	The british, if you have watched pirates of the Caribbean had built up a navy armada, that in fact triggered from the attempted spanish armada in the 1500's.    This meant Britain was well poised as a nation to control as much seas as they could, reaching far and wide.    It would be untrue to say France or Spain didn't have their own empire.    Spain and Portugal for example controlled most of southern america, France controlled parts of northern america, and some african nations.    But it was Britain who rose to the challenge, fueled by their ingenious intelligence and inventions which led to the industrial revolution, which put British trade first in line.    They controlled much of the world, merely because they were dominant navy powers, as well as economic.    It's funny how history repeats itself, look at america in the 1990's, a superpower and world economic leader. It was perhaps, that America that took the crown off Britain as world leaders though.    But yeah...everything comes to an end eventually...But British still have rule over certain islands dotted around the globe, and in the 20th century still had control over some nations still, some african nations in as late as the 1960's.|`|3woyz5ucaa	That's what Thomas Paine though and explained to the colonists in his pamphlet "Common Sense", saying that a tiny island cannot rule a distant land.|`|q6phm94caa	Britain isn't a tiny island in the Atlantic, smaller than the USA maybe but lots bigger than Gaza, and Britain has never dominated the world, only large parts of it.    When the Europeans began exploring those parts of the world unknown to them in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it soon became apparent that there were huge benefits and riches to be gained from lands overseas. Britain's geography, as an island nation, and having the natural resources of oak forests, and minerals necessary for naval superiority gave her an big advantage in the competitive colonisation that followed, so Britain generally came out on top.     The industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gave Britain the opportunity to develop its own manufacturing industries using its own people as sweat shop labour. Britain's aristocratic government gave her the power to do this, and the result was a massive superiority in British overseas colonisation, trading British made goods for colonial wealth, and providing the funds for Britain to maintain an overseas Empire.|`|AA11304025	Natural resources which enabled it to build a strong navy backed by the industrial revolution and an expanding population which aggressively explored the rest of the world|`|AA10838998	Well mixed genes from various invasions led to an above average intelligence,which gave rise to industrial revolution.

And it was the money made from the Industrial Revolution that paid for the Empire's expansion overseas.|`|bhjxyuRMaa	where are you getting your information from ??? check history book,    Yeah by they lost only because they choice o wrong way, if they would meet in open sea without a storm britain would lose very fast.|`|1gnNDagMaa	It doesnt matter what size the counrty is as ong as the overment and the people in the background doo a good job.|`|11800e554877352dab31b88c50263dc1aa	when did they ever dominate the world? the world is bigger than you think. and goes further than columbia or africa.and iceland is no more or less insignificant than any other little island including britain.    serious enough for you?    ohh please people ; you call yourselfs a world dominating nation ? 2 inches of snow and london is falling to pieces.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	First, Britain is not a tiny island as island nations go.  Iceland, for instance, today only has 300K people living there, Britain is around 50 million.  Iceland did not have the population to become a world power,  to become a world naval power, you have to have the resources to build a fleet, the economic ability to build and maintain the fleet, and the manpower to keep the economy stable while keeping a large proportion of the males in the country maintaining and training in the fleet. Iceland just didn't have the ability to become a world naval power as Britain did.    Britain became the Queen of the seas long before the start of the industrial revolution which started in the 19th century.     Two reasons that the RN was so much better than other navies of the time were Doctrine and Tactics.  The RN was for the MOST part a navy of free men who chose to be in the navy.  The men that sailed with Raleigh, Frobisher, Hawkins and Drake would generally get a share in the prize money and motivated men made better warriors then conscripted or slave labor did.  Tactically, most navies wanted to capture other ships(so they could capture the treasure in the ships holds), while the RN didn't care as much about saving the ship, they wanted to win the battle, so British gunners trained more often and thus were the best.    Britain had the very rare combination of wealth, resources and willingness to use those resources to become a world power and thus became a world power for nearly 400 years.    whale    DC -  If you quit reading wikipedia as a source and started reading actual historical books, you would know that the Royal Navy dominated the seas long before the start of the Industrial Revolution, therefore, logically, the Industrial Revolution could NOT be the reason for said domination of the seas.|`|TlXCqSBtaa	Pride not only in themselves ( something sadly missing today ),technology, A firm belief that they could do no wrong. A strong moral streak ( also sadly lacking today ).|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Because Britain was the leader of the Industrial Revolution and many new countries needed the support of a Big Power, Britain had puppets on that countries.That`s how Britain ruled , by means of puppets, as USA did.We must not forget that the wealth needed for the Industrial Revolution came from Piracy.The British Crown had Pirates at her service.It means that that wealth comes from robbery.|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	You might also ask why a small mediteranian city state did so well for itself (Rome).    However, we did not have the legions, we had the Royal Navy and powerful enamies.  During Drakes time, the Navy was not a formal body in the sence that it is today.  It was more like a collection of self funding ship masters who were given Royal warrants.  These warrants included a form of legalised piracy against the enamies of the crown.  So the navy of the period of exploration was not all that hot.  However, due to the Spanish success in the new world, it was advisable for Britain to expand and explore as well.    The Napoleonic wars also played a large part in forcing Britain to invest in its navy, as well as exploration and trade.  We also had the East India company.  As success from British trade became profitable targets on the India route, including valuable spices, the East india company built its ships to not only transport cargo, but to house cannon as well.  These ships were distincive in that they carried a poop deck.    Rather than having royal backing and start up fees, the crown had a simple policy.  You can go off and start a colony if you want.  If you are successful, we will establish it with government, military etc.  In short, turn it into a crown colony.  So there was a big incentive for a colony to do well.   Also, the crown did not wast money on problem children.    With India, sea power was only a part of the puzzle.  The British Army was able to mobilize a modern force to face any local trouble.  They were well drilled and battle hardened from the Napoleonic wars.  Also, India was not one country, but a collection of countries, often with despot local rulers that could be bribed, intimidated or removed.  It was a long process, but eventually Britain had a large empire in india.    Africa was a different matter.  Although the British, like everyone else, colonised the coastal areas, very few roads were made into the centre of the country.  That is why this was known as the dark continent for so long.  Not because of race, but because little was known about it.    So, a good navy, a good army, politically smart and able to set up colonies with little start up funds.

Remember the darker the colors will always make the room too dark and you will have to bring more lighting in.  With an even mix it will be interesting and colorful.

zRFvk96Eaa	I went to www.maxthemutt.com      I highly recommend my school. The first year is exclusively dedicated to improving your general drawing skills. The second and third years are all about animation. Classical, and 2D in flash and toonboom.     You need a foundation is 2D computer animation along side your traditional skills to get steady work.    Just a drawing course would be more useful out of the two you described. However there are fundimental principals of animation they just wont cover.    Pick up the Animator's survival kit. It's an amazing book to get you started.     When choosing a school look for one that has these courses:  Life drawing / anatomy   Perspective  Cartooning  layout  storyboarding  animation  Clean up and inbetweening.     If they don't have equivilents to these courses they are not good schools  Also look for a school that has a portfolio requirement in their enrollment process. If they don't ask to see a portfolio they aren't strict enough on their enrollment.     good luck!!|`|fy35c6vGaa	The sad reality is you will not find much work by taking that path.    Most animation is 3D now and what little 2D is left is done with flash after effects and toon boom    The days of paper are almost over and the few jobs that are out there are few and far between|`|BGKjKfINaa	floral scenery|`|ar6fZlvsaa	No colleges offer an Animation program...

N28zLxtpaa	You should probably wait till she's 18 at least depending on where you live.|`|k7MINvaIaa	It's likely not legal and certainly poor judgement|`|pZGLhV2Waa	It is illegal. If you posted those on Flikr you could be sent to jail for kiddie porn. You both must be 18 or you or her are committing a felony. If she is under 18 and you got caught you would most likely get a jail sentence possibly federal if you posted them online. You would also have to spend the rest of your life as a registered sex offender. It would also work the other way around. If she is 18 and you are 17 she could be arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a minor among other things.    Just don't do it.|`|e29b0c8b08bfccce474d6efcc471aa17aa	She must be eighteen, and you must be eighteen as well.|`|oXPDFw4daa	You need to know what is the age of legal majority where you live.  In most places in the US, it is 18, but in some places in Europe, it is younger.    Assuming that you and your model are both under age, then you could get away with this PROVIDED you get a signed release from your model's parents or legal guardians.  It might also be necessary for your parents/guardians to sign a release consenting to the photography on the basis that you are 17.  Of course, the conversations that would have to take place prior to releases being signed would be interesting - - -    Practically, you would be well advised to wait until both your and your model are legally adults.  There are two reasons for that.  The first is the simple legal reason that if you are adults, you have the legal right to made decisions about whether this is something that you want to do without having to get permission from the 'rents.    The other reason may be more important - even if both sets of parents agree to the activity, it is possible for someone to challenge their wisdom in granting permission.  Well-meaning busybodies can really screw up your life.  That's what happened to Jock Sturges - and resulted in having his photographs and equipment confiscated and his reputation ruined.

Follow me - here, let's start at the park and I'll tell you the story.    Take in the park around us: the rolling green and yellow hills, spotted with bare patches the birds ate the seeds off of immediately, the playground slide and swingset swarming with children eyed by watchful mothers.  See that lady, in the blue flowing dress?  Let's follow her.  We'll talk as we walk.    Veronica was [age] years old when she first realized the horrible, terrible, wonderful, life-altering truth.    She was going to have a baby.    Follow the lady in the blue dress, mind you don't get lost - we're going to turn off the srteet from the park to this little one here, with the houses.  Aren't they charming?    See how the lady is going into number 14, with the flowers outside?  Don't follow her anymore, we're going across the street, to number 15, with the pink petunias.  This is where Veronica lived when she realized she was pregnant.    Here, let's go around, peek in Veronica's window - don't worry, no-one can see you.  Look at her, poor dear, hunched over on her bed, remnants of a pregnancy kit strewn about her, the bed-covers in disarray.  Oh, look - she's been crying - see those black streaks going down her cheeks, from the cheap mascara she wears?  Coming down from her dark dark eyes?    She can't even afford good mascara - neither can her parents.  How will she afford a baby?    --------------------------------------...    And that's how I'd start off a story.

She rarely got in trouble, and she always knew when to say 'no', she had straight A's, a loving family, wonderful friends, and she was very popular. Veronica was smart when picking boys to date, and her parents would awlays approve.    One day, things went to far with a boy named Chett Larson. ( Sorry, I just chose a random name, you don't have to use it.) During her friend, Annabelle's huge party. Someone brought drugs and alchohol(Sorry, don't know how to spell =p)  The alchohol was put into the punch. And everyone drank it, Veronica drank too much and ended up in bed with Chett. Veronica felt so guilty. A month or two later, she realizes she has not yet gotten her period. She takes a test and finds out that she is pregnant.So, she decides to go tell her parents.    "Mom, Dad, I have something really important to tell you," she said nervously during dinner.   " What's wrong, Sweetie? You didn't get suspended or detention or anything like that." her parents responded.  "Nothing like that," Veronica defended. Luckily, Veronica was an only child, then her siblings would probably blab on about that fact that their irresponsible sister was pregnant.   " Okay...I think I may be......pregnant," Veronica said, her voice shaky.  AT first her parents' eyes widened with shock, it was silent for a long time. Her mother broke the silence,  " ARe you sure? Who's the father?"her mom asked  "Yes'm I took many tests, I haven't gotten my period in two months, I've gained weight, I'm having odd cravings, too. THe father is Chett...Chett LArson."

Maybe she could have been kicked out of her house when her parents became aware she was pregnant! You can use this if you want. Not as inspiration but take it as your own! I don't care! Just right as you like!    Possibly your first paragraph could be something along the lines of:    I remember the touch of his skin against mine, I'll never forget that. It was like my whole life had just fallen into perfect alignment so nothing mattered but him. Oh, how I wish I could go back to that moment and stay there, Anything would be better than what happened after! the look on my parents faces as it was etched into my brain. My mum's wails and my dad frowning down on me as he dropped the last of my bags down and slammed the door in my face.  I felt a tear roll down my face and I looked away from my boyfriend, oh, how he was so comforting to me in even these times of hardships.  "Come on, It's late Veronica, let's go home," He whispered" in my ear.  "Ok, anything for you" I replied in his ear.  We turned and walked back towards his house as I looked back  across the lake, at my old house. It still hurt to look back . It just refreshed the memories. I wish my parents could have forgiven me and let me stay at home. I would give anything to return back but I don't think that will happen. At least, not anytime soon. I sighed.  "Veronica, it's ok. You couldn't help it. Just forget about it for now, I promise that I'll make it better for you. Trust me."  "I do trust you. It's just, I miss them. I can't help but think what would have happened if we had waited."  "I know, but we didn't wait and this is what happened. Let's just relax for the night and not ruin a perfect evening."  "Ok." I had given in, he was so irresistible to me. I lent up for a kiss and he gave me one that we held until we couldn't breath and only then did we drop it.  "Come on Veronica, time to go home."    How does that sound? Use it if you want or change it or modify it! I don't mind.    Have fun writing a story and good luck!

fDHOKkjdaa	You have to solve a problem to set it aside.     Logically, you either flee or confront.     What ever the choice you make, be aware you might face it again.  Therefore it is better to confront it and solve it as even a similar situation occurs, you already have a solution. A problem with a solution is no longer a problem.    Consider that this solution has to be found through reflexion, it gathers precious thoughts that might be useful.     Moreover, can knowledge be harmful?

But there is a difference between thinking about it and dwelling on it.|`|AlGIl16Daa	Glenn is right, don't sit there and dwell on it. Thinking about it and thinking in the future things will be different and much better is the key.Optimism. Not thinking about problems is neglecting them, and eventually they may come back to haunt you and developed into much bigger problems.     Think about what you can do better to fix it, and if there is no way to fix it, think about tomorrow.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...hmm, understand your dilemma...darn it you do or darn if you don't...    ...be confident and responsible for all your choices and actions in your life...  ...remember its you that can make your life a better place for yourself...    ...good luck...|`|AA11488628	there is a difference between not dwelling and mulling over a past issue(s) and repressing them. when you don't think about it you have just let it go and moved on and in time you forget naturally most of the problem. when you repress something you do not let it go but allow it to fester. you put up a mental block and won't allow your self to remember or think about it at all. so it is both really. you should do both.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	who says you shouldn't think about your feelings?  thats what psychology is based on|`|VgQy2haaaa	It is an individual thing but i'm pretty sure that you shouldn't keep everything to yourself. though i do not believe that you shouldn't have private thoughts and feelings.

yLq6PZ9Paa	Maybe photos of something 3 dimensional like a pinch pot, or a sculpture.  You could do a collage or maybe a drawing that says something about who you are.  Be creative.   Self-portraits are always good too.|`|H91tVrXSaa	most portfolios need a few still life drawings, a few of your drawings that you do in your free time (that reflect your personality more than just in-class assignments) and maybe you should include drawings of different mediums (paintings, charcoal, pen, etc.) instead of them being all in pencil|`|qsdqStBaaa	Hey, I'm in 11th grade too! I'm also working on my portfolio. It's a good idea to show variety in your portfolio. My favorite subject matter to draw is animals. That could be good and if you're into architecture, you should try some landscapes with buildings. Also, many colleges like to see self-portrait drawings, too. I'm not quite sure why, but every art camp I've gone to had us work on self portraits or suggested that we submit one.

24K0h5t8aa	i like it alot.  i like how you didnt rhythm.  it was very creative : >|`|AA12223903	I like it very good poem with alot of meaning. I like the dark autmosphere int he poem and how he feels. I like the way you or he did that|`|beLRXUN4aa	i think it was very good.  i feel a poem is good when the writer puts there own opinion, and how they feel into it.    i think it is better me the reader understands what they are trying too describe a little more tho...but i still enjoyed it
W1UHwwsoaa	Neither one sound catchy enough for me to read it if i was browsing for book. Just being honest.|`|0c26d9546e638de3a2d0bd923ac856beaa	Angel Games.  Seance sounds like a cheesy B rated supernatural movie or a Goosebumps title.|`|Amf1wtJmaa	Between the two, sounds like Angel Games would be a good fitting name.

How about something along the lines of Truth, resurrection, Fanatics, something to do with the beliefs of the fanatical religious group . . . this is just a stream of conscious on my part, but I'd pick up a book about Truth any day.  But that's just me.    Seance and Angel Games really don't fit either for me, but Angel Games sounds more interesting.  I'd have to read the story to really know what it should be called.    Good Luck!  I hope to read it one day - do you think you could email it to me?  It's emeraldmist01 AT yahoo DOT com.  Your story sounds really cool.

My rationale:  -  The word 'angel' will capture attention.    -  Both words are short and easy to read at a glance.    -  The title gives a hint of what the stroy might be about but also causes one to wonder what 'games' might apply.|`|VAjird8Gaa	I think Angel Games is more intriguing, and makes you want to find out what exactly is happening.

qdlmy4l8aa	If you don't think it is wrong to waste, are you really wasting? I didn't feel remorse for flicking away my cigarette before it was smoked to the filter. Didn't I waste it?     Wasting can be applied to anything; not just "Johnny eat the last bite of your Mac 'n' cheese, there are kids starving a million miles away from you." I never cared for that argument. Want to do something about world hunger? There are better ways than by forcing your kids to eat beyond their fill. Isn't THAT wasting?|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	"Waste" is merely a human concept related to the idea of utility and exploitation of natural resources. On the scale of eternity, in universal terms, nothing is ever "wasted". If the earth suddenly disappeared, would the rest of the universe "miss" us, or could our measure of existence be considered "wasted"? Not likely.|`|YogATwEoaa	Because all the poor kids in Africa have nothing, and wasting is just down right selfish. :D|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	toxic... kills animals and plans and ozone|`|2Ko12Elfaa	Because it interferes with the obligation to help.  Let's look at a situation from a utilitarian standpoint.  I make $25,000 a year, and after expenses I have $3,000 left over.  My disabled neighbor's provider has died and the government gives her nothing.  She is starving and cold.  That year, I give her $3,000 because it's the right thing to do**.  Now let's look back at the expenses I mentioned above.  Why did I have $3,000 to give her and not $4,000, $5,000, etc.?  Maybe on some days I ate half of a Big Mac and threw the rest away; then, when I got hungry later, I bought another Big Mac and ate half of that.  Maybe I bought more expensive clothing than I needed or bought a car with lower gas mileage because it looked good.  All of this money wasted could have fed and clothed my neighbor.    ** Many people reading this will probably consider that act more than sufficient to ease one's conscience.  This is really part of a bigger problem with the idea of charity, that it is just something extra you can opt to do when you feel like it.  The fact is that in this case, if one is the only person helping, giving less than one could have afforded to give *is not morally sufficient.*|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Don't ask why it's wrong to do something.

If you waste food it was money not well spent. if you don't have a lot of money that is a very bad thing.  If you waste plastic and other recyclables you are damaging the environment.  THINK BEFORE YOU WASTE!|`|vxbzE9hNaa	lets say enviromental resources:  its wrong becasue I want to give the same chances i had to next generations,  i dont want to leave a messy planet for them,  however right and wrong is just a matter of opinion,|`|qSbNY5XPaa	"We shouldn't waste things because it doesn't teach us to appreciate anything for it's full worth." - an interesting thought.    Voluntary, avoidable waste is wrong because it is a direct result of greed and gluttony. It is wrong as long as one considers these traits to be vices.
8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Superb question!!    We are living beings and as such, the key quality of our being is 'dynamism'......... we can only improve or alternatively deteriorate.... the third option of remaining static or unchanged is not available to us as living beings.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	A lot of people think that but i do not think it is so  maybe we just think  we are wasting away when we really are not Kentucky fried chicken was started by a man who all his life did mostly nothing and then when he received his first social security check and though so this is it ; and then used that check to start K.F.C. there are meany stories like this one, so i say no.|`|sxKaorAXaa	Do you mean every waking hour?  I think humans need time away or some kind of distraction to improve well.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Good question. I believe yes, we are. Neurons & synapses, use em or loose em.  Yes as humans, if we are not improving our own or someone else's life I really feel we are wasting away. Stagnant. Inertia.   Unless you can convince me other wise.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Yes all in every way.|`|ouEix2a2aa	Improving your physical life is a part of achieving success and financial freedom. You can improve your physical life significantly by watching what you eat, exercising on a regular basis, and setting aside time to relax each day. Your life is out there waiting for, but if you take too long, it will be gone|`|VgQy2haaaa	I think that to not waste away we do need to move forward at a constant rate. if we don't we might just be enveloped by the the vastness that the future holds.|`|1xcfGHCNaa	i don't think you loose anything..but your pretty much, stay in the same spot you were 10, 20, or 50 years ago when you decided not to improve yourself. but i mean, this is most of the world.  why live your life if your not actually going to live it?|`|ZA23H0wqaa	yes  obviously  since birth we r improving day by day  and when ever we think of our childhood we feel like they were the best days of our lives . why ? because e kept on improving all those things which were going wrong at that time so why not now.   and if people stop improving their lives then surely they have wasted their time|`|fDHOKkjdaa	At worst, will you be harmed by improvement?    The self essence of improvement is based upon the fact it is a good evolution. So, if it is a good change, then how can improvement be bad?    It cannot, as good is diametrically oppose to bad.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	what is improving?  we humans are evolving as is our culture and society,  i dunno what improvement is|`|AA11311184	I agree with "small" with one difference that may substatiate "leroy" as well.    There is a notion of eternal stasis which is not evidenced in the natural world, yet is not falsified either. If at time we have regressed in the natural world, and our character as well has ostenibly reverted to a less useful state, there may under ourselves that latent potential in that eternal storehouse that when reached for could restore all things meritorious.    Should one not know of public services for metaphorical example, then they may remain deprived, likewise should one know of shuch services but not partake they too would remained deprived (and feel more for it possibly because of their knowing), yet should someone stumble up those services, or one with knowledge willing gain the assistence of that service, then their well being may be restored.    If memory is restored, and hope, and effort comes from the wellspring of energies created by that source of hope, then what was wasting becomes say, like a compressed spring for some, much effort was used to compress the spring perhaps, and with all that work no gain seen by those thinking the purpose was merely to close the gaps in the coils... until uncompressed, the backward movement, slow, painfully hard, is all reversed with great effect. Just be sure not to walk away from the spring unprepared for its released or the recoil may hurt far more than the pain of fighting it to a compressed state... It's no fun having seven devils worse than the first, so to speak.    God bless.|`|7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	if you're just a bag of bones destined to rot,yea,you're wasting away.you dont have to be old,necessarily,to feel this way.if all life does is hurt you all your life,the pain is so intense,you literally feel that you're a waste yourself.
LVZdzPmpaa	First, she needs to go to the police and file a report. If she gets no response from the police, she needs to visit them daily and continue to file reports.     Your friend also needs to put the house on the market and remove herself to a shelter for battered women. If she has 50% equity in the house and her name is the one on the mortage/deed, she can list and sell the property.     If these two are not married and are not common law, the needs to call the police and have him removed from the property. If there is no lease and he pays no rent, he has no legal claim to be there.     The fact that he "thinks" he has a claim to the property does not mean that he does. Your "friend" is a victim of mental abuse and needs to get some help immediately.    Call the local police and speak to someone in Crimes Against Women. They will have contact numbers for local resources that can help.    Usually women who get themselves into these situations are very afraid and have a tendency to buy into all the threats, claims, etc. because they are unable to separate truth from fiction or fact from fantasy and because they believe that men are always more powerful and always win.     This is why she needs the support of an advocate.     She would also do well to a) lock the bathroom door; b) bathe/shower elsewhere; c) disable the electric outlets in the bathroom; d) remove all electric appliances from the bathroom.     Above all else, she needs to get it in her head that she doesn't have to be a victim.|`|AA12095483	You're on the wrong page for this - but if your friend has been threatened, she can call the police and get a restraining order against her partner.   As to the house - if they bought the house between them, he does have a claim on it. That would take a lawyer to settle - but it's more important that she protect her life by contacting the police before the whole issue becomes hypothetical because she's lying in that freshly dug grave.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	She could document the abuse (for that's what it is) and get a court order.  Wait until he's out and get the locks changed.|`|mdWIkoAxaa	Call the police|`|sTSBk9jhaa	Call the cop and get a lawyer for 50% claim. But get out no matter what.|`|jKXLmmBEaa	Okay first off why would u pay cash for a house? Unless it was like a tiny house like under 50k wich is like 50k for a tiny little hobo shack these days 25k is still alot of cash.... Secondly you should call the cops and if u havent already this is just a joke because what can we do about it on here? I mean honesty yup were cops on here that know exactly what the problem is can solve it like that. for god sakes we dont even know your first name! Just call the cops and report it to them. they may want you to go down to the station wich i reccoment you do so they dont just file a report and they dont see it till like yoru friend is dead and they are looking at past files for a shadey history. I wouldnt reccoment your friend and her husband or whatevr even see each other anymore. You have to get this on tape too otherwise just testifying is just like a 3 year old running up to their mom saying that they just saw a bank being robbed......got it? Good. Btw she may wanna get a restraining order from her husband and get a divorce (obviosly). Good luck and best wishes and i hope i dont see another murder on the tv again.    ...  Colers26|`|Di6ZNZ45aa	Sounds too serious to let go. I'd speak to her first to try to get her to speak to somebody, if she won't I'd go to the police.    Threats like that being made is not normal.
FaX8awk1aa	one thing you might want to say is that americans asked if they could migrate into Texas.  The Mexican government said yes if they would abide by their laws.  After arriving, the americans almost immediately wanted their freedom from mexico.    Is this the way that americans operate--lying to get what they want.  This almost the same thing they did with the indians too.  americans have a tradition of being liars.  is this want we want to live with?
w9WhNM0Taa	its awesome! i would definetly read it. keep going|`|ouUVmrNWaa	I don't know how old you are but this reads like a diary.  This kind of stuff can be done in a paragraph.  Still you can spell and at least get something on paper.  I would suggest some reading from a somewhat more serious perspective than you have been exposed to.  There should be someone at your school who can introduce you to some half decent teen literature .  Don't give up!  You may be amazed when you see what can be done & take a big step forward.  Good Luck !|`|BOrQXRo7aa	It's good. I'd keep reading if you gave me more, very informational which I'm not terribly fond of, but I can see it turning into something great. You've got some grammar, worduse, and spelling errors, but they are easily fixed. good luck with the story.|`|MI9hdO5uaa	Great! Keep writing and post the rest sometime, I want to know what happens between the girl and COdy!
EnmnHwhWaa	I really, really like it. There is nothing wrong with the way it is...and it's a good length. It's really amazing!|`|5sH8JAVkaa	I think it is very good. Maybe you could say at the end... All the pain just disappeared. Never again to reappear. There he went up to the sky. Up to see the big guy. Sorry, it's not my best work. You could just leave it how it is but mine is a thought you can ponder on. Oh and I'm very sorry about your lost one. May he live with God and see his good works.|`|TKHA5okpaa	It's not bad.  I dont want to be disrespectful to the memory of this person but, it's a little plain, like your basically just telling a mini story through rhyme, or like very simple lyrics to some song.   I think you'd be a really good songwriter.  I've  always thought of poetry as more descriptive, thought provoking, something that conjures alot of emotion.   I'm not saying you have to be the next Walt Whitman, but if you read his stuff that is what I consider poetry.  Try thinking of what you want to write about and dont concentrate on trying to rhyme it, or explain it like a story. Write whatever you feel even if you think it makes no sense just let yourself write down "feeling" then re-read what you've written and you'll see what I mean.  This sounds like a rock song to me, and I dont  get that last part  "He took what he couldnt live without"???  It doesnt make sense....  But considering the circumstances if there was a crush you had who commited suicide I would think there were alot of feelings and thoughts running through your head and heart, but all you did was write this|`|tYiQA2STaa	That's very good, actually.    The only thing I would re-work would be the line "He was just a kid!" there are too many syllables; it doesn't flow well with the rest of it.  Maybe change it to "for just a kid" or something like that...just to knock off that extra syllable; it will read much more smoothely.    As far as hitting writer's block, I don't know why you think you need more.  It's pretty powerful like it is.    Nice job!|`|eG6iObzFaa	first im sorry about your friend and the whole situation. the poem is really very good so far except i dont really understand the last two lines.    i would take out the last two lines and have:    so much confusion  so much doubt  he took his life  within, without    no one could help  or so he thought  he lost the battle  no matter how hard he fought    hope that helps and gets ya going if you're going to continue this poem.  good luck and God bless!|`|0LdCigGQaa	Your poem was really good.You dont need to add anything else to it.|`|XBulMn2zaa	I don't think it is so much writer's block as a failure to realize that it is done.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	How about--     So much doubt,  He came up with a permenant solution as his way of getting out.|`|sF5buu5caa	Im so sorry about what happened, and your poem is quite exceptional.

Tell about her eyes, or something smple, just to soften her up!!!!!|`|ow4yChcJaa	I agree with some of these answers.    First off, if you're wondering if you're giving her too much, you can only ask yourself that. I have no idea how much you guys care for each other. Maybe you know that she likes being spoiled.     As for the poem, i think it's sweet. Definitely keep it under one page. And I think it would be the smartest thing to write your faults in the poem. Suck at writing? write that. Don't get her? write that. (nicely) Feel shy? Write that too.     ex. I may not call myself a poet,   I only call myself in awe.   Since the first time I saw your face  if you could see what I had saw    Doesn't have to rhyme either. It might help if you're not good with words, though. Keep it light and not too deep. Do your best to keep it short. Write in compliments like I did in my example. Also, if you don't mean what you're saying, don't write it. That's the best thing you can do for her.    Write what you feel. She'll love it no matter what.     Hope I helped somewhat. Good luck!|`|pg47OZ2vaa	Aw, that's sweet you're putting in so much effort.  I understand what you mean that poetry can be a little intense.  Here are some options you can try:    1) Just write what you feel.  Make it funny or loving or whatever suits you two as a couple.    2) You can look at some famous poems and take the parts that remind you of her and in your card just have them in quotes splattered around.  This is nice because while you don't have to worry about what to write yourself, it will communicate that you put effort into it and are thinking of her enough to recognize her in poetry you find. You can also add quotes as well.  You can choose the vibe you want.  If you want to go romantic, you can look for poems about love and adoration, if you want to be a little less passionate and a little more showing your appreciation, think of the traits you like about her (kind?  fun? honest?  pretty?) and find poems that go with that.  You can use this next website and plug in any words and it'll bring quotes with that subject.  You can google poems.    http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Love   (you can put in your own word instead of "love" into the search engine)    You can search poems and look through them yourself, but to give you an idea:    (For the passionate, romantic vibe:)    "Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver  in some stagnant lake,  Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances  to fantastic tunes,"  (excerpt from "The Sphinx" by Oscar Wilde)    "Were Eve's eyes  In the first garden  Just a bit too bold?  Was Cleopatra gorgeous  In a gown of gold?" (excerpt from "Jazzonia" by Langston Hughes)    "Love   Is a high mountain  Stark in a windy sky.  If you  Would never lose your breath  Do not climb too high." (excerpt from "Love Song for Lucinda" by Langston Hughes"    "...why should I carry this love with me to the other world?  Why not give to you what is yours?" -from Bel Canto (novel) by Anne Patchett    "He went down trying not to look at her, as though she were the sun, but he saw her, as one sees the sun, without looking." from Anna Karenina    (The more appreciative vibe:)    "Oh the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts or measure words, but pouring them all out, just as they are, chaff and grain together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and with a breath of kindness blow the rest away." -Dinah Craik    "You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person."    "A brave heart and a courteous tongue.  They shall carry thee far through the jungle." (from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling)    "Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about?  It just makes me feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world." -Lucy Montgomery    Some of those have different traits, but if you can put a bunch in and say they remind you of her, it's so personal and so nice because she can look through and feel good about herself.  You can also combine the two categories (passionate and appreciative) taking whatever suits.      3) Instead of a poem, something cool you could try is to give her a letter or card in code.  I read about somebody doing this once and thought it was the coolest thing ever.  First, it's not so daunting to deliver it because you know she can't read it right away.  Second, it's going to drive her a little crazy (in a really fun way) while she tries to decode it.  You can use a simple cypher.  Write out the letters of the alphabet in a row.  Then in a row underneath it, spell out her name (minus any duplicate letters) then continue with the alphabet, taking out any letters in her name.  For example, if her name was Allison:    A B C D E F G H I  J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  A L I  S O N B C D E F G H J K M P Q R T U V W X Y Z    Then, when you write your letter, instead of the letter in the top row, use the letter in the bottom row. ("You're adorable" becomes "YKU'QO ASKQALE.)  You can make her wait for a few days, a week, however long, to give her a chance to puzzle it out herself.  Then at some point, tell her how the concept works (That you used a word and if she can guess the word, how to line up the letters.)  And then whether she figures it out or if you have to tell her, she'll feel very special realizing that you used her name as a code to a puzzle.  This would be my preferred Valentine, but I think codes and such are really fun and poetry from a guy would make me feel a little overwhelmed, but that's just me.      ------  If you're keen on just writing your own poem, maybe you should still look through some other ones to get ideas for how you want yours to be and ideas of how to be more unique.      Whatever you decide, bravo for you putting in the effort.  Your girlfriend is lucky.
OJB9L1Qraa	Right now I'm doing some very uninspiring math and I decided to take a break and write a sonnet. I was lacking inspiration before I wrote it and now I feel refreshed. It might inspire her too.    Math is Boring:  Step by step, we all walk down this path.  The farther we go, the less time we have.  Counting our seconds is just useless math.  Conserving this life when theres nothing to save.  What hope can we have when we wont survive?  With everyday lived, were closer to death.  We march towards the end when we havent the drive.  Destined to expire, we still take each breath.  Why must we fear such a conclusion?  To take our time we must have patience.  Can we learn to see past this illusion?  The moments we have are just an instance.  If time is money, how should we invest?  Ill spend mine wisely before I must rest.|`|c939571a66fe4d865e91279242d560aeaa	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry I could not travel both  And be one traveler, long I stood  And looked down one as far as I could  To where it bent in the undergrowth;    Then took the other, as just as fair,  And having perhaps the better claim,  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,    And both that morning equally lay  In leaves no step had trodden black.  Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back.    I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.    its called The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost
VKVHSmlRaa	Hi, The first step to writing a story, is to find some inspiration. Don't just expect it to come to you. Go for a walk in a busy place, on your own and just watch. See what happens. Also, constantly ask yourself questions, like what would happen if... or I wonder if... or what would I do if.... Everyone is different and inspiration comes in different ways to different people. Just wait and watch. Use your imagination. Constantly be on the ball. And, if at first your stories are terrible, don't stress, just keep trying, practice makes perfect.  Good luck!|`|zV3CzIbnaa	out line is a big step!! it helps you gather your thoughts|`|hkMy2vFHaa	This site will help!    http://www.writing-world.com/basics/inde...    Good luck!|`|EwgWssq2aa	finding an idea for a book is hard at first, but there are plenty of sites out there that will give u a starting idea without it being considered plagiarism.   BUT i personally like to think up my own ideas, and i do this by thinking of something i really like. i usually go camping to get my ideas.  write whatever goes into your head onto a sheet of paper and work from there. DONT put characters in until you're certain you have a pretty good plotline. of course, whatever you write isn't set in stone so you can change it whenever you want to.  and dont let other people change ur mind about ur ideas. its normal to be a bit shy about showing ur writing, or thinking that it's a bit corny. it probably isn't.  good luck!!!!!!!|`|xh6VmtHaaa	first thing is to use literary elements for example:  The wind whistled through the tree tops.   that would be personification.    recommend literary elements  metophers  smile  personifiction  repition for effect  alliterion  magic three  voice  mood  theme  hook    to begin with you have to have a very strong hook to get the readers attention when they look at the first page.       why dont you read a few books and look at the beginning to see how they started off the book to get some ideas for your beginning.|`|gn59CIDNaa	1. Read three romance novels.  Learn plot.  2. Rename characters, change them a little - but not too much, we want them to still be recognizable as stereotypes!  3. Decide if you want a 'mature' romance novel, or a 'young audiences' novel.  4. Outline plot, add a few details, but leave everything very generic - you want to be able to write along an outline, not to an outline.  5. Check grammar and spelling, punctuation, etc, etc.  6. Look over what you've written.  What needs to be cut?  Added?  7. Lock material in a drawer for a week or so.  Don't think about it.  Fall out of love with it.  8. Reread, repeat step 6 indefinitely.    That should be pretty easy for a first book - it won't be a jewel, but neither will it be a failure.    Tell me how things are going - email me at lily DOT advice AT gmail DOT com.  I love hearing about new stories.    Oh, and it's not plagiarism if you get ideas from people - but you need to mix them up.  Your mind should be more like a cauldron than a pantry - don't store things up in it, but set them in the mix, simmer and stew, change, develop and take on new flavors.  Stored ideas get stale and go bad.  Plagiarism is when you take someone's words verbatim and claim credit for their work as yours.    And please, don't write the way you wrote the question - use proper American English.  People will automatically look down on you and dismiss you if you cannot master your own language.  Try   - using proper words, not 'u'   - invest in spellcheck  - read over your work and ensure you have proper grammar and punctuation.  - don't create huge run-on sentences separated by ellipses, write PROPER sentences.  - Ensure that you capitalize 'I' when referring to yourself and also the first word of every sentence.  - do not use phrases like 'help or tips or something,' instead try 'please give me some help and tips.'  Everyone likes the word 'please' and nice grammar!

No website or book can tell you how to write because everyone has their own unique ideas and ways to present it. A couple of tips:  1) Try to make your first sentences interesting and make them catch the eye of the reader.  2) Use detail and imagery.  3) Proofread, proofread, proofread.  4) Ask family and friends to read over parts and critique them.  5) Don't give up!

Sometimes stories/books (especially unpublished works that are in first person) really annoy me when aspiring authors make the mistake (in my opinion) of writing in present tense instead of past. I'm glad that you didn't do this; it was refreshing. Your use of action drew me into the story from the start which is essential to a good story, book, chapter, any written work. Keep writing, and I liked the detail and imagery that you presented in this excerpt. I can only imagine how good the final draft will come out. Oh and just wondering how old are you?

I Heart You, You Haunt Me by Lisa Schroeder  -Beyond an amazing book. This one is written in verse, so it would not take you that long to read.    Far From You by Lisa Schroeder  -Again, written by the same author and it's even better. It's still written in verse and only took me an hour to read.    Generation Dead by Daniel Waters  -This is a good book, about people that are dead they come back from the dead. But what happens when a total gothic chick falls for a living dead person? Yeah, it's really fantastic.    Harvesting the Heart by Jodi Picoult  -My favorite Jodi Picoult book, by far. I can not forget anything that happen in this book. Every detail sticks out to me. It's a really amazing story about a young mother who is trying to find herself. I know by hearing that it sounds kind of boring. But believe me, it's not at all boring. I hope you read this one.     The Truth About Forever by Sarah Dessen  -Again, amazing! This book really said something to me, and it's a really good read. I loved the characters in this book.|`|dHpyd5OHaa	It might seem a bit immature on the outside to someone used to reading outside of the YA genre (I'm a highschooler as well, and I usually read adult books, too), but I was really surprised how... not shallow Twilight was.  The character development was really incredible, and Stephenie Meyer has a uniquely descriptive and personable writing style.  If you haven't give Twilight a shot yet, I'd say at least try it out ; ).    Other than that, I loved all three of John Green's books.  They're quick, witty reads with great characters.    The Thirteenth Tale is also one of my favorites.  The plot is amazing.

6ULx1uoBaa	While you can never go wrong with a classic, here are some other choices:     - I really love Jodi Picoult books. They are usually about a particular family going through something. One of my favourites is "My Sister's Keeper" which has such a unique and interesting plot.  for more information: http://www.jodipicoult.com/  http://www.jodipicoult.com/my-sisters-ke...    - Stephen King. I don't see how anyone can go wrong with Stephen King.    - I wanna be your Joey Ramone by Stephanie Kuehnert, which a story about a mother, a daughter, and rock n' roll.   http://www.amazon.com/Wanna-Be-Your-Joey...    - Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. This is a historical fiction, and is based of the painting "A girl with a pearl earring" by Johannes Vermeer. It's such a creative story and puts some meaning behind the painting.  http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Pearl-Earring...|`|Iub2QWaIaa	I recommend anything by Pat Conroy. My personal favorite was "My Losing Season" which was his life story. That is also the one that got me hooked into reading all of his other books like "The Great Santini" "The Lords of Discipline" and "The Prince of Tides."    As far as romance goes. I really don't care much for them but I live near Nicholas Sparks so I feel obligated to read his stuff and I have to admit they aren't half bad. The endings are not predictable and I like that about his books. My personal favorite of his was "Three Weeks With My Brother." Which was his life story.|`|55G0BNCzaa	Dante's Inferno.  its about a guy who travels throught the nine levels of Hell. its realy interesting.|`|elUCyhzFaa	go to the store Chapters|`|0lh4Cxx4aa	I'm reading a juicy one right now: The Passion of Mary Magdalene by Elizabeth Cunningham. Basically, Mary (called Maeve or Red) and Jesus were lovers and got separated. Red was forced into slavery in Rome and was made to be a prostitute. That's all I know so far...  What I like is that it's written in today's slang even though it takes place in ancient Rome, and it's raunchy, funny, and guilty pleasure reading.

Listen, I know a lot of people who hate it and think it's so stupid, but that's partially because they only saw the Twilight movie, and made an assumption based on only that source. But the Twilight books aren't good because of Edward Cullen and vampires and Bella Swan and all that, (well I guess it's a big part, but there's more to it) the Twilight books are a good read because they involve romantic tragedy, emotion, mystery, action, and fear. Stephenie Meyer (the author) uses magical realism to tie the 'not so real stuff' with realistic everyday things and the modern world. If you have never read these books and are willing to give them a chance, I promise you, it's worth it. My mom has a 56 year old patient who reads the books (creepy but oh well) and so the books aren't really only for teens. Once you read Twilight, you love it, and when you read it again (because of obssession, see I promised myself I wouldnt get obsessed...guess what happened. I became infatuated.) you find new things. I suggest the Twilight Saga, and if you don't want to even go near them, fine, but you are missing out.

Because I don't have as much time as I would like to be able to read  right now, I haven't been able to stay up on all the good reads that are out there.  But when I'm not able to get to get to  Barnes and Noble and asking an avid reading employee, I use the following websites that let me search key words and genre of books.  I've found great ones!  But my favorite mystery authors are John Grisham (The Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill, The Jury etc) and Dean Koontz who always presents an exceptional mystery with twists and turns that come right when you think you've got it figured out.    My favorite resources for finding well written and unforgetable books:    http://www.booklistonline.com  (on the left hand side of the homepage, select  adult books and a detailed drop down menu will help you quickly narrow your choices.    http://www.npr.org/templates/topics/topi... (my favorite site for finding different, the classics, the less well known books and authors and more--on the right column check out the "books on NPR stations".  National Public Radio always delivers!)    http://www.reviewsofbooks.com  (specializes in reviews of newer published books and offers good links to other good reference sites)    http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/  (another absolute favorite for help in finding a great book--never been disapointed--great reviews and lists of books by well written authors)     I hope my favorite sites might offer you not just a resource, but also that you might find some enjoyment in the search too.      Happy days!|`|yn3f8Ooxaa	The Host by Stephenie Meyer it's an adult science fiction books for people who don't like science fiction. It's really wonderful.|`|o4xqX86aaa	A Great and Terrible Beauty series by Libba Bray. They are wonderful, LARGE books. The era is set in the Victorian times, but it's nothing like those difficult novels that you can hardly understand because it is written in our time. It has magic, fantasy, and romance. It's a wonderful series, and you should consider looking them up.      A great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, The Sweet Far Thing|`|rVffUp1Maa	Tuesday's With Morrie is a great book. It was written by Mitch Albom, and it's a true story. Mitch is a journalist who promised his favorite professor from college he'd keep it touch. He didn't.

She's really fake and annoying if you ask me but whateverr.  And as as far as Taylor goes, I am pretty sure he is, he gets on my nerves too but i am team Edward so it is all good =]  I've heard that they're debating on letting Kristen Stewart play Bella in the Eclipse or Breaking Dawn because she was "smoking pot" but I doubt they will really take out their Bella because she made one personal mistake.|`|YpP2QFt4aa	Most likely yes. And now people are saying that if Dakota Fanning is Jane, that the guy in high school musical Lucas Gabriel will be Alec. I think they will pick her because she is small, looks like a Jane, and is a great actress. It will either hit the box office big, or fail epically. Lets hope for the best that Vanessa Hudgens dosen't get the part of Leah Clearwater. Lets all wish and pray with all we have that New Moon the movie will make it big so they can make Eclipse. :D    Yours truely,  Another Twilight Fan.|`|cb3eb62547cb6c9331eff7e93098582daa	It's unofficial, but probably. Taylor Lautner is still on. But be nice to him and Jacob. C=|`|LIUIamFQaa	Yes, she was confirmed. Mostly because she is small and fits the description.|`|BIsUgpTOaa	yes unfortunately. she is such a little brat.
JYMzqUKRaa	To be honest, I am not sure you need a nickname. I have written some novels and when you add nicknames, you add confusion on which character is which. Pretty soon, your reader can not keep everyone straight. I think Lucas is a great name and it is somewhat haunting in and of itself.  I know how hard it is to give up your first idea but in this case I would. Just my opinion and I hope this helps sort things out.|`|Mb3HxZiiaa	Umm... he sounds kind of like a tough back woods kind of guy?? maybe not because he wears shorts..but ..  Red  Buzz  Spud  ... these are nicknames of people i know and think of when i read your description... Hope I helped!    EDIT: I just came across a site with a ton of nicknames and their meanings... some good ones too like Rutter, Trick, Ayer. Check it out, you have to scroll down a little bit, but they are there!  http://www.ancestry.uk.com/Nicknames.htm|`|zTEvTWXCaa	luke ice(sounds like a superhero)|`|Kbi3Cm41aa	cary or carr maybe casey  working off or that c sound in lucas idk|`|cupxeThNaa	his nickname could be ghost, or loner.  It is hard to say since you only described his looks and not his character.|`|HT1Jb7zOaa	ludda|`|dcycBGrpaa	If you meant a nickname like a name, you could use Luke or Jack. But if you needed a nickname on like, how he looks, you could name him Ice Eyes, Sunboy, or Headband.|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	juice, day day, sunny, awall,shaun dell..... or maybe jaucque|`|qRtYPAUwaa	Ray|`|gNCIvJiDaa	brad or kyle or kevin those are perfect names hope i helped!!!!!|`|sdAhwgEjaa	Luke?

That kinda sound like the demonic somethingorother you mentioned|`|wZFlfRahaa	Claus or Lucky.  Claus is an anagram of Lucas, but it's not that noticeable.  Lucky is just playing with the first three letters Luc, and making an interesting name.|`|NkjuLwbxaa	I like Claus, liek the person above me. Or maybe Blake...it means darkness of black or something like that.|`|7NEbLq8gaa	maybe you can call him MANJI ( man-gee) It sounds mysterious and strong which he will be later on down the road.In his past he travelled and a high preistor somebody gave him this meaning " strong man or world leader" but nobody knows thatit stands for what he is like being a creature call SAMANJI. A really creepy wet creature from lucifer's groin, dripping in evil he embarks on engulfing this small town because this house the main character and little brother are somehow connected to( thier great great great grandmother's house where lucifer and the great3 g-ma had this witch thing goin on and created Elano under oath,fire, hate and secrets.)

AA11207089	Hm.  Without more info, it would be very hard to tell the worth.  How big is it?  How nicely framed is it?  What kind of condition is it in?    A good place to look for free for art prices is FindArtInfo - for originals or lithographs or seriographs.  If yours is a print, best place to check is probably eBay (see link below also).
59kGOjcSaa	Yea, I like them.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Yes, I do love Twilight and thanks for asking. I already read the first three books and I saw the movie Twilight too.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	nope. shall i tell you why?  i think i shall.  1. bella is annoying, whinny, boring, stupid, and selfish  2. there is a lack of a plot  3. the characters are Mary Sue and Gary Stu, they have no personality, spunk, or the spark of life  4. its written horribly  5. i don't need to read about how "HAWT" edward looks on every page.  6. steph meyer is horrible author  7. breaking dawn was by far the worst book i have ever read. first the impossible pregnancy, and the "fight". meyer sets it up to be really good and then nope, nothing.   8. the ending is TOO perfect  9. bella is TOO perfect when she is a vampire  10. the characters don't learn or change.  11. the annoying fangirls drooling over a fictional character.  12. its overrated  13. it gives girls a horrible message which is woman need a man to survive. especially in new moon, bella becomes catatonic for 6 MONTHS just because edward leaves. then she finds jacob and she'll happy. then jacob tells her he doesn't want to be friends and she's depressed again. come on.  14. the books are sexist  15. the books set feminism back a 100 years  16. my personal favorite, "Twilight made me cry because i could feel a part of my brain dying."  17. it gives a bad name to literature  18. its cliche love. a super hot guy falls for a normal clumsy girl. how many times have i heard that?  19. vampires don't SPARKLE and none are vegetarian. meyer destroyed the name of vampires.  20. Edward is so GENERIC  21. Edward is a stalker.  22. Jacob imprinting on a baby = pedophilia  23. Bella getting pregnant at 18 is a bad message.  24. there are plot holes after plot holes after plot holes.  25. Do you want me to continue? because i have more to say.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	yup|`|7Sxh61UPaa	Some people hate them....but i love them :]|`|TPpTAKAdaa	I really like the books, I thought they were amazing.  I read the whole series in like a week, they were so addicting.  However, they're not my favorite series, but they're still one of the best.  Yet, I think they are now getting just a bit overrated.  I have no problem with this though.  It's great to see people walking around in Twilight shirts, and its fun to be able to discuss its plot with virtually all of my friends.  :D I just hope the Twilight fuse doesn't burn out too fast :D|`|jN0njYgjaa	I HATE them and I was just wondering if u do!!!!!|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I enjoy them very much, thank you. They're off the hook, if you ask me.|`|03DOpyaHaa	Nope. Not one bit. I like my action.|`|IJzGX1UTaa	yes!!|`|0xiHNsmVaa	No. Not at all.|`|IgM7B9rSaa	Yes i  love them soooooo much, i have read twilight 3 times, and the others twice, seen the movie 6 times lol. i used to be team edward but then i met taylor lautner (jacob black) ay a convention and now im TEAM JACOB! lol im so happy hes jacob in  new moon, did u hear dakota fanning might play jane in new moon, oh btw if u loved twilight, i would recommend the host by stephenie meyer as well, very great book!|`|pws54J1daa	I LOVE the books! They are the best series of books that I have read in a VERY long time!! I was going to have a Twilight theme birthday party theme for my birthday. But the movie comes out in March 21st. I can't wait until the movie comes out becasue I loved the movie. And she is actually publishing Midnight Sun!! YEAH!!|`|swigidUeaa	they are completely overrated. Stephenie Meyer just spits out a bunch of words that will please the demographics and make a bunch of money. She has no literary talent.|`|y7IiZwuYaa	So far i do im only on the third book but im halfway threw that one|`|e18d072e364cde72f131e9f26a7a62b0aa	no I would have to say   i don't  im sick of all this talk of it on Y!A|`|mtz9Nqqiaa	wow that's original...I started reading them before they that famous so I'm kinda over it....I'm obsessed with the host now|`|5dVpkTR7aa	Yeah, I am a die hard Twilight fan. Lol.  I enjoy these books because they're different from other vampire books, they are for teens/young pplz, and most girls/boys enjoy them. I think it has a great plot, good characters, and the style of writing is amazing.  BUT THAT IS JUST my OPPINION!!! Everyone has different ones.|`|dXjzqqGUaa	Like is an understatement im obsessed with them!|`|7hfbQTxjaa	SEARCH BAR!|`|HO082dzXaa	Well i like them but all my friends are obsessed. But i am not gonna be ones of this twilight haters who are all messed up. Heres what i like about twilight i like the characters and the idea of the book(human girl falls in love with a sexy vampire). but i don't like how the author puts together the book. Or how she makes bella so obsessed with edward and edward so stalkerish and overprotective. But overall i enjoyed reading it. but its a little confusing. i like how it is really romantic and lovey dovey. that series got me into romance novel. i suggest reading a walk to remember-nicholas sparks its so romantic. its a good book if u like the lovey dovey kind of stuff :)|`|w3yrnDEiaa	No
47MJBpC9aa	sing the song what ive done by linkin park|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	Make sure it is an upbeat tune like "I Think We're Alone Now" or one of the new pop love songs like "Romeo and Juliet" if it is up and something the audience can move to you are more likely to get better scoring and audience applause. You can also peruse MTV.com and look at artist videos for performance inspiration. Remember don't only sing move! Break a leg!|`|Cpp1LddVaa	George Gershwin is always a good bet, with songs like "Summertime," "Someone to Watch Over Me," and "Soon."    For something funny and off the beaten path, try his "Blah Blah" song which makes fun of "typical" songs in his day:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMblICcv7...

8asG4WCwaa	For short stories and poems, you do not need an agent (most of them are not interested).  You can google for Duotrope, which has a database of magazines that accept short stories and poetry.  Visit the websites of the magazines to get their submission guidelines.|`|IgM7B9rSaa	umm try google or something like that they wud have alot|`|PO4vNQxhaa	Yes, you first take your work to a literary agent, who will submit your writing to a publisher for you.|`|9rEOY77raa	I don't think there is such a thing as a good publisher. get anyone that will take you. send letters to everybody. most people try at leas 15-30 publishers before they find one that will accept their work.
TbTO5SXlaa	This is a tough one. A lot will depend on when your tour takes place. If its between 30 to 45 minutes after sunset your chances improve.     I read over the specifications for your camera and suggest using Manual Mode. Turn the flash and auto focus OFF. Just focus to infinity at your widest zoom (27.6mm) with the f-stop at f3.5 and set your ISO to 1600. Make sure the Image Stabilization is ON. Try a shutter speed of 1/125 sec. and check the results. If that gives you an image that is too dark then go to ISO 3200 and use the same f-stop and shutter speed. You can use a program like Noise Ninja to "clean up" what will be some noisy images - but at least you'll have images.    In case you're wondering how I came up with the settings, I referred to my trusty FotoSharp ( http://www.fotosharp.com/ ) "Day & Night Exposure Guide" using 'Scene 45 minutes after sunset".      Good luck.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	Just for hahas, you might try putting your camera in "party" mode, or shooting your ride as a movie.|`|mrjRPHzTaa	In my opinion, this will be very tough to get sharp pictures in a helicopter at night. If you go too high on the ISO you'll be very grainy.  Use the widest aperture you can get, use about 1600 ISO.  You can normally hand held a camera at about 60th of a second, but in a helicopter, who knows. Plus if you have some kind of image stabalization that might help.    I would take a few test shots locally and see how grainy the higher ISO shots come out.    I've also never been to vegas so i am not sure how bright it will actually be.    Interesting question though.    Just an addition to this answer. If you do go with the higher ISO and notice they are grainy there is a cool program online called: Neat Image on NeatImage.com, it processes your picture removing grain. I know some people that swear by this software. Just a thought.|`|li9WGkzLaa	i have a Nikon D60 usually what I would do in the scenario is Depending on what you want the picture to look like i would steady the camera and then in some places put the camera in automatic a lot of times i turn my flash off although I do not know much about fujifilm my D60 automatically brightens the scene so that is what i would do sorry i couldn't be much help|`|062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	Night pics of a city, from a moving helicopter - "A bit difficult" would be an understatement!  Minimise, or better still, do not take-  zoomed-in shots. Go for wide-angle shots. Any handheld night shots you try with the zoom, especially when you are MOVING, will be shaken beyond use. As you say if you try the reverse by increasing the shutter speed to minimise camera shake then the exposure will be limited by the largest aperture you have in the camera and will end up with under-exposed images. The compromise would be to try and use a shutter speed like 1/250 or 1/500 for starters - it may be sufficient if you are using the widest angle of the lens. Use the largest aperture and do not worry about the depth of field - you are unlikely to focus on a single point of the cityscape while on a chopper flight. You are likely to use infinity focus anyway.    As for the ISO performance, that will be comething for you to work out before you are cleared for take off. Try taking night pics with ISO800 and above and see how the images turn out. Note that it is a compromise between being able to use a faster shutter speed and a very grainy image, you will inevitably have to strike a compromise. Unless you are absolutely certain you could live with the resulting images from using ISO 6400, I wouldn't use it. The best thing would be to take a few test shots under high ISO settings and see the results.  Even my DSLR produces far too grainy night images under ISO 3200.|`|okYPU9H3aa	This is the best advice :    When in any moving vehicle its best to take images out of the front or back windows rather than the side windows.     Helicopters have windows that give a 180 degree view, choose to photograph the view you travel towards.    Las Vegas at night is going to be very well lit which will help your cause.     Set the ISO at 400 which is fast enough for the speed you are traveling at and still a reasonable quality.    Use a shutter-speed of 1/500    Aperture    f-6 - f-8    What you are trying to juggle is enough light hitting your film or sensor to capture the scene. The lower the f-stop number the more light comes in thru the lens. The lower the ISO the better quality image you get. As you pump the ISO you lose quality. The best thing to do is take one image check the histogram or image and fine tune.

aL8Pj3dtaa	yes,     www.watchtwilightfree.info|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	yeah at watch-movies.net    they have good qualitys. there the best bootleged videos ive eva sen. just make sure u watch the 1 that is ranked the highest by the vewiers|`|MzgecQSLaa	i hear you can, but the sound quality isn't very good.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	check surf the channel|`|IgM7B9rSaa	not sure, try youtube|`|ONe2lanlaa	you can but you shouldnt|`|PlnO0bHXaa	Yeah. at www.watch-movies.net but it really sucks (the quality)! and you can only get through half the movie, before it says "you have watched 72 minutes of video, please wait one hour before continuing" or something of that nature.|`|1vz3NvJ3aa	watch-movies.net|`|4iV72gNkaa	Yeah,you can watch it at watch movies-net.com the same awnser as the first person who anserd your question!
zG1nb4x6aa	No, he's definitely doing New Moon, due in this March (filming).|`|6PbyKpHzaa	He doesnt do drugs. Yes he smokes and drinks but he is 22 he can do what he wants. And his hair cut was for the better. Because Edward is not suppose to have crazy dirty hair like Rob usally does, Edward's hair is suppose to look something like it did in Twilight.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	No it is not true. So what if he cut his hair? It's "Hollywood." They have their ways. Plus, he signed a contract saying he would do all three movies. So, weather he likes it or not, he has to do them.|`|I59iQYzbaa	no he is, he already signed a contract for it|`|97p0ZbvPaa	Nope.  Kristen does drugs . . if they got rid of Rob, they'd have to get rid of her too.|`|ulDKq4Nvaa	No it's not true and besides he's already signed on to be in New Moon|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Kristen's the one doing drugs. Rob is just dissing the book in several interviews.|`|jva9NCOyaa	no. Like the other two answerer's said he already signed a contract and they would have to take kristen off to. His hair will grow back by the time they start shooting so that isn't a problem. The reason most celebrities get into drugs and alcohol is because they feel like they need to keep getting better for their fans to love them and they feel better themselves when they do the drugs or drink the alcohol. it may seem like they have the best job ever, but really they don't. its a very stressful and difficult job.    Hope i helped =D

6ULx1uoBaa	Reading is quite different, yet the same to writing, in my opinion. They both simulate the imagination in different ways. Reading allows us to step out of our minds for a while and take a walk in another's shoes for the time being. It takes the scratches on a page, and turns it into a story, something that has meaning, and at some point, it becomes our story. It teaches us that other people's opinions, their happiness, sadness, and feelings should matter to us. Reading teaches us a lot about humanity and life in general.     Writing also offers a lot of learning but more internally. As you write, you may begin to realize some things you didn't before. And it is more about communication and revealing a piece of yourself onto text and paper. It's about having a seat in another person's life.    Both can be hard work and enjoyable, and one can't exist without the other. I don't know if that answers the question. But that's what I can conjure up.|`|ouUVmrNWaa	Reading is, or should be a pleasure, fascinating, entertaining, even enlightening.  Writing is work, Some have to write eg. Kafka.  Others struggle and many suffer.  Don't do it if you don't have to !!!!|`|x38sIvyxaa	In my opinion, writing has a stronger effect on the fortification of creative facilities than reading does. Obviously, you can't write without reading, but writers must draw on their own experiences and beliefs to create characters, plotlines, and themes.

Those are some things I do when I want to get my mind off of Twilight.|`|vGuSAaGtaa	Umm.. well if you want to revive your obsession.. go to hisgoldeneyes.com OR goldeneyestheiforum.com    If you want to get rid of your obsession for a while, read the Host.

I would say starting off don't doctor or alter a lot of your images at first, try to use natural compositions and let the themes shine through very simple shots.

It totally sucked.  Start over, and don't try to make it rhyme.      Although, if you're writing it for a middle school English class, you should get an A+.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	You did a good job with your rhyme scheme, always rhyming your 2nd and 4th lines, sometimes your 1st and 3rd as well.    In answer to the question "where do I go from here" you might consider the following:    Look at the meter and how the words flow off of your tongue and lips when you read the poem aloud.  In many instances they are awkward and do not flow as smoothly as you might like.    You might also consider making the stanzas more even. The extra bonus here would be to make it easier to set them to music.    Overall, a good start with some good potential.  Later, after a couple of days to let it "cool off," and give yourself an opportunity to distance yourself from it, you'll want to go back and "rework" it to see if it can  be better.    Good luck and best wishes.|`|G1V9Hvldaa	i loved it. it was amazing and i though it really would hit home for some people.|`|aBh7uZkuaa	that was totally awesome i love how the words just flow together|`|iJ3BeFWxaa	Absolutely Beautiful !!

It might inspire you:  http://publishingthechildinme.blogspot.c...|`|PCug0kU0aa	Google " children's publishers " and you will find plenty results.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your children's book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.    The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.    Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.    Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.    Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.    Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.    You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.    I hope I helped.

hl4kkvXhaa	I'm terrified of needles, so I thought I'd never have the guts.  But, one day, I decided I wanted one.  Now, I proudly display a small wild horse on my calf, and plan to get a Cessna put on my shoulder, and a dragon on my hip.      Personally, I don't have a problem with seeing someone with a lot of body art.  It's how they express themselves.  But it does gross me out to see tattoos covering the entire face.  I'd never personally do that, but I don't think it makes a person bad.  They're not any less intelligent...and they're not necessarily a thug or thief.  It's just their way of expressing themselves.    For me, I don't want a lot of them.  I prefer a few tattoos that are well placed and tasteful.  I want them in places I can cover easily if I need to.  Most of all, I believe that they should symbolize something important to you.  My horse and dragon are symbols of my totem (spirit) guides, and the Cessna would be in honor of my aunt who was a pilot.  Anything I get would have to be custom, meaning I usually come up with the design myself.  I wouldn't even let the tattoo artist who did my horse to take a picture or keep the transfer paper because I didn't want a ton of people having my tattoo and diminishing its personal meaning to me.    I think tattoos should have some sort of meaning because they are usually stuck with you for the rest of your life, unless you can afford removal.  I used to want to get one with my favorite band because I've loved them for over 20 years, but who's to say I'll love them in another twenty?  The same can be said for cartoon characters, or anything else that is your "all time favorite".  People's tastes change, and I wouldn't want to be stuck with something that I'd grown tired of.|`|P7L4Vd3Paa	It's not for me - I hate needles and can't think of anything I'd want permanently on my body.    However, I don't think differently of people who have tattoos.  My husband has several, and I think it's just fine if that is how you want to express yourself.  He does get "looks" from people sometimes though (he has one arms covered - like a sleeve down to his elbow).|`|e8ee53810406b4bfc80c42a6743042e0aa	Well, I am not so sure about my "believes," but my beliefs are that it is something that you should put some thought into. Also-- pick a clean place and don't use flash!!! "Off the rack" tats are SOO lame!  Have fun-- don't pass out...
b5eSmOhiaa	Farm life  GOOD:  You can get your own supplies, depending on the type of farm you have.  You would get to enjoy the peace and quiet of the farm.  You have a lesser chance of being sick due to plague.    BAD:  Who will be there to protect your little piggies and yourself?  Your family will probaly get a lesser education, because they will need to help you out on the farm from dawn to dusk.  You will need to work very hard all day.  Bandits could very easily kill you...Remember, you are a farmer.  You probaly do not have experience with a sword and the gun hasn't been invented yet.  You will be treated poorly by nobles, and will not have alot of money.   Town life (This one was a hard one, because you could be talking about a town with a castle, or just a small, poor town.  I'll say that it has a castle =P)  GOOD:  You are well protected by the troops and the castle.  You will most likely be richer then the dumb outside of town. Your children will most likely have an education, and you can get food right in town.   Depending on were you live, the soldiers will protect your home.  You have the latest clothes, and a fine horse.  BAD:  Plague breaks out, causing you and your family to be miserable and lose members of the family.   The city is under siege, and you don't have anything to eat because the city has run out of food.  You pay the king high taxes to live in the city.  Thugs break into your home, scaring your family and taking your precious items.        These are my reasons.  I would want to live in the city, because I would be more safe if I lived by the castle and I would live a life of luxury, and peace, if my town wasn't attacked.  Hope I helped =D|`|Eu9x0p8Paa	Well, it would depend on the place of the town/farm. I'd only go to a farm if I was guaranteed to get good crops. But town life is better, I'd need the social interaction.  Oh wait, theres no internet in Medieval times...  NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!|`|FmAse7pUaa	Farm life...towns were nasty places and if a sickness or plague came around there was a very high probability of you dying from it due to the population density.|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	I would prefer farm life because i could grow my own food, be closer to nature an not be crowded by too many people . Down side to living here would be that I would have to travel further to get to town if i needed to go there for supplies.   If i lived in town i would be closer to the action/people and traders. Also would feel more protected by the bigger numbers of people that live in the town in case we were attacked. Down side disease can spread faster among people especially if they live in close quarters to each other. Towns tend to be more dirty in general I can only imagine how they were back then.    Over all i would pick the farm life. Manly because i can grow my own crops and have my own animals. I think my life would also have more meaning because i would always have something to do. And  I would appreciate the fruits of my labor. Plus i can make money by selling crops or animals that i raised.|`|ucZOCMyAaa	well, I am imagining that we are considered peasants, since town or farm is were they lived.    I would prefer town.    this is why.    If you worked on a farm, that meant that you would live in the province thingies with the king (lord). You couldn't do anyhting without his permission. You could not get married without his permission. Then, if you did get married, the king had the right to take the wife for the first night and do with her what he pleased.     Now, If you lived in town, things were diffrent. If a peasant lived in a town for 1 year, they were considered free.   Which one would you rather have?  The town is definetly the best choice.|`|Lh4S3q53aa	Well it would all depend on your personality.   Farm life would be great to stay away from mass disease. I.E. the plague.  but at the same time war was everywhere and you would be better protected in a city or town.        Farm life would be great for feeding yourself and wealth if you owned the land.     City life could be prosperous if you were a good salesmen or trader.     Really up too you...  =)   Id just join the army and fight....   The average life expectancy back then was 30 tops...|`|NmV5XWlJaa	Towns at that time were small and poor. People were rude and didn't bathe, so houses probably smelled. Farm life may have been equally poor, but at least people were more independent and their lives a bit more peaceful and quiet.|`|WZNaNvplaa	With farm life, you'd a) most likely be working for someone else, or even if you were a "freeman" you'd end up paying most of your crop as some form of tax.  b) Most crops in the medieval era were substance level crops. The amount of surplus was always iffy, and crop failures were not uncommon. c) Life on a farm was a sunrise to sunset proposition, with human muscle power providing the bulk of the energy needed to clear fields, plow, harvest, thresh, etc.  Horses and mules were not common property for most farmers of the time. d) Given the superstitious nature of most of the rural people of the time(90% of the population), you'd have to worry about being thought of as a witch, or at least a jinx.  The more eccentric you were, the more likely this would be the case. e) like to read? Ain't happening on a farm. what books were available would have been found only in towns or cities, and usually out of reach of common people anyways. f) like to spend money? Most farmers and rural residents didn't HAVE money. Most currency was circulated in the towns and cities. Most people on farms would have bartered for needed goods or services. So, while you might be able to swing a pair of shoes in exchange for a goat, if you wanted to take a nice trip to the ocean shore, you'd be hard put to make it. Imagine trying to take enough goats, cheese, fleece, or other goods to buy what you need along the way.    Also, sanitation for both city and farms sucked. Bathing was considered unhealthy, and done only reluctantly in most cases. As for changes of clothing, you'd be lucky to have 2 sets of clothes. Not understanding how rats and fleas helped contribute to disease, people often killed off cats as creatures of the devil. And even the rural areas would not be immune when the great plagues of the 14th century swept the continant.     So, what about cities/town? On the plus side, you could make a living in more ways than you could on a farm. You'd more likely to have actual currency to spend instead of having to barter for things.There was opportunity for education and literacy, at least if you were a male, and if you came from the right social background. And more people means more variety. You were more likely to hear about other places and meet more people living in towns.     On the minus side, social barriers were fairly strict. If you were a peasant and you wore clothes inappropriate to your class, you could be punished. More crowded did make for more chances for sickness. And most sewage systems of the era involved waste literally flwoing through open ditches in the streets. Also, towns would be the target of armies of whoever was at war with the country you lived in. They did, after all, hold both the most money, and the bulk of the production capacity needed for waging war. So You'd risk being caught in a seige and having lots of big rocks thrown at you.     Your best bet would be in living in the largest towns or cities available. Best education, best chances of making enough money to live a comfortable life, and the best chance of "blending in" to avoid nasty things like Inquistions and witch hunts.
KPXwwwMMaa	I would start by trying to find a local Luthier:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthier    There are violin, mandolin and guitar luthiers. If you work closely with your luthier, and share sketches or drawing for your own 'custom' guitar, a good luthier will not only help you with design, but they'll help make certain your design maintains good sound, clarity, and vibration.    This may be helpful in finding a luthier (in the US):   http://www.luth.org/    If you want to design your own electric guitar, you may also try contacting an existing guitar manufacturer about customizing your design.     Be prepared to spend a LOT of money on your custom guitar. A well made custom guitar is built from scratch (not factory assembled) and will likely run you between $3,000 - $10,000 (USD).|`|AA10772950	Well... I know I heard of a website out there (I'm sure if you yahoo searched it you could find it) where you can buy certain guitars, and order specialized ones - but if you're talking plain wood guitars, do it yourself! Sand off the shiny finish, paint your image, seal it with a glossy finish, and voila! Custom guitar.

tzdIS2RPaa	Dear Alex,    I can pretty much assure you that the casting company will not supply you with a gratuitous flight. Really, when you consider the concept more thoroughly, they cannot be certain if you will be a positive asset to their company, so they may end up losing money if they pay for your flight. If you continue to submit video auditions and remain tenacious and confident, they may determine that you will play the role well and accept you for the film. THEN, and EXCLUSIVELY THEN, they may pay for your flight, because they can be certain that it will have a positive affect on them, and it will result in them acquiring additional money. So, if you DO desire to travel to L.A. and perhaps increase your chances of obtaining the role, you will be required to pay for it.    Sincerely,  The Optimum Juvenile :)|`|eulMjLtPaa	No, they will not pay for your flight.|`|PlnO0bHXaa	its out of your pocket

Utrecht has a monthly "skills" feature in which they describe different artistic processes. I believe last months was a primer on screenprinting. Also- go to your local art supply or craft supply. The Speedball brand has several screen-printing starter kits starting at about $35. Precisely replicating your photoshop designs will require the use of Diazo emulsion- which is similar to a photographic process. Diazo is light sensitive and you expose the screen to light (w/ the "negative" or transperancy on top) and it will block the ink in light areas less than in dark and you will get your reproduction. Most graphic design programs require you to take at least one print making course that includes screen printing BTW.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Buy a silk screen and the rest of the stuff.

At fifteen I would try to write from within your personal experience and try a few short stories to avoid monstrous confusion .|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	Okay, so first question. They would definitely NOT take a commercial flight back. (To dangerous to the public.)  And a title... well, I'm usually not good with that, but I'll give it a shot.   Stranded  Marooned With A Murderer (Cheesy,  I know.)   And I think I would need to know more about the characters and the situations and such to continue.   Hope this helps,   A fellow teenage author|`|YIvmVV0laa	That sounds pretty interesting. I would write about a private jet being unavailable so they have to use a commercial plane but there is no one on the plane because of the killer being there.You could make a huge scene at the airport where flights are delayed to accommodate etc. and they end up taking the wrong plane that doesn't have enough fuel to get to their destination so they are stuck in a storm with low fuel and i dont know lol

A carved funeral monument discovered in 1900 CE has on it the name Meryt-Neith. Egyptologists believe this to the third ruler of the first dynasty -- and realized that the name likely refers to a female ruler. Other excavations support the idea that she ruled with the power of a king and was buried with the honors of a powerful ruler. But the inscriptions and objects tell nothing else of her life or reign, and her very existence is not well-proved.

eJMOGeRraa	It's very hard to accurately explain in words.     1.Stand with your feet parallel.  2.Step forward motion with your right leg and move in front of your left. Should resemble an "X".(Right crossing left)  3.As soon as 2 step is completed backstep with your left leg, so that your feet are sort of in front of each other.   4. Upon completion of 3 move your right leg (should be in front of your body) to it's natural side the right.      Now speed it up, jazz squares are competed quickly.

Fires caused by lightening, floods, drought, etc., are all nature's way of cleansing itself to prevent overpopulation. We might not understand, but it does serve a purpose.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Nope. Would you see a photographer taking a picture of a house on fire for a newspaper trying to put the fire out?  A photographers REAL job is to simply record the facts on film. Whose going to "rescue" the penguins after the photographers leave the scene? The only humane thing to do is to allow nature to take it's course....and possibly allow the penguins to learn survival on their own....or die trying. And if the penguins survive what are the polar bears going to eat? Should they starve at the expense of the penguins????|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I think they should. I would not be able to sit there and watch a baby animal get killed. I definitely would have to rescue it. But maybe this is why I don't get hired as a nature cameraman for those shows?? :D    OH I JUST SAW THAT SHOW!! JUST NOW!!! I WOULD *NEVER* LET THOSE POOR THINGS DIE LIKE THAT!!! WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH THOSE PEOPLE?  I am sorry but maybe it is weird of me as a guy to feel bad for penguins. But that was just wrong. How sad. The polar bears should have eaten those people up.    And whoever gave me thumbs down is a evil animal abuser. Have fun in hell.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	What is helping an animal? If the crew stopped shooting to try and herd the penguins back, might they not have panicked @ the appearance of men and more in the main group may have died.    Saving one animal may mean another starves. Do we save only the cute ones? This is nature, not a zoo or preserve. We should not interfere in the natural process. The only time I might make an exception is if I found an animal that was dying & couldn't be saved, I might put it out of it's misery (this would not be changing the outcome, just shortening its suffering).    We have an unusual way of seeing things because we are more intelligent and we're the only animal who (if we avoid accidents & no one murders us) have a very good chance of dying in our sleep.    Go back 1000 years & we might have been as much a lion's dinner as that gazelle. Think the zebra thinks "poor guy"? Nope, he's thinking "Yippee! I'm Alive!"|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Journalists are rather like vampires.  They feed off death and catastrophe and excuse themselves from interfering in the name of objectivity.  A journalist would start a war for an exclusive.  A journalist would pose dead bodies to enhance the shot.  If it made a better story, a journalist would save the penguins.  On the other hand, a naturalist tries not to interfere with things like freezing baby penguins.  People get in the way more than help mostly for lack of understanding and by having agendas.  Would you feel the same about saving snakes or spiders?  Penguins are cute.  They make us smile.  Babies are cute.  They arouse our protective instincts.  But what makes us feel good isn't necessarily what's best for wildlife.  It has to be a clear case of humans messing things up really bad in the first place to justify getting into the equation and moving things around.  After all, nature's been doing a pretty good job all these years.  What you didn't say was whether this took place in a wildlife preserve or not.  In a preserve, people are prohibited from messing around with things, so that would answer that part of your question.|`|U3ApaKhqaa	Hal. doesn't have the slightest idea what he is opining about.  In a nature documentary, you are filming nature, as it is, to the extetn that you can.  Remove the film crew and what would you have?  The SAME dead birds.  You ae showing what happens in the natural environmnet and nature is neither kind, nor cruel, it just is.      As a documentary photographer, or filmaker, that is the job you have.  Do you always like it?  Do you ofen wish there was something you coul do?  Of course.  But then, who would tell the story that maybe millions will see who can, if they act in some way, change the story?    Hal mentions something about documentary nature photographers and film makers making a living off of death and violence.  Thye make living off of showing those of us cocooned in our little houses the scope of life from birth, through development and the day-to-day struggle to make it until that final moment when it all comes to an end.    Oh, and Hal. I have my press credentials.  Before you comment on photojournalists, take the lens cap off your perspective on things.  You comment is only a shallow and very broad ignorance.  If butt holes were like camea lenses, then I would say you were shooting at way to fast a shuttter speed and way to small an aperture to come up with a useable image.    Vance    Vance|`|VnikjPsUaa	They are "allowed" to do whatever a human being should do in any situation.  They are probably saving more penguins by documenting the suffering of a few so that society can learn about them and their living conditions.    Sam Kinnison had a great bit about the people who photograph children starving in Africa.  "Don't tell me nobody had a sandwich on them?  FEED THE KID AND THEN TAKE HIS PICTURE!"  You have to imagine Kinnison shouting at the top of his voice in order to appreciate this.  Of course, you can't save a life by giving a child one sandwich that he probably can't digest anyway and you can't choose one child out of a million who need a sandwich TODAY, so you take your pictures and move on.    I was invited to take pictures at a wedding last month, but I could not do it with a clear conscience.  I told the couple that they are always fighting and will end up getting divorced anyway, so they shouldn't get married.  They told me not to interfere.  Maybe the penguins feel the same way.

AA11921320	That's a good question to ponder over.  If you were creating experience in your mind wouldn't you create something better than the long work day, the bizarre governmental systems, high gas prices, illnesses and disease?  Hermes taught that all is mind and many others have expounded on that idea but if we're really creating the world through our mind, why are we complaining about so much of it?  If we are that creative, why not creative self filling cupboards so we no longer need to grocery shop, self filling gas tanks or flying abilities that require nothing more than thought, to operate them, peace and harmony among the nations and every individual?|`|AA10700683	I hate to say the answer is Yes and No, but it is.       On the yes side, all our actions, creations, inventions, even hang-ups were present in our minds before they were manifested in slaps and kisses, children and stories, ratchets and gee-gaws, and visions of paranoia and victory.       On the no side are two factors. First, the mind doesn't see it as a game. So the mind, which is working 24 hours a day, even in our sleep, is constantly creating paths which we choose to take or not take. Second, I do believe that the things I see, as I look about this room, were visualized by other minds, not mine, and one of those minds is the God Mind that puts into form all the clay I might choose to buy at the local department store. There is an intelligence beyond mine because, even though I may think I am pretty hot stuff, there's a lot of stuff out there that is so hot that I can't even touch it with protective gloves.|`|AA10145152	The world is not a game--it's real, how we choose to experience it is purely self created in our minds. Think about the decisions you make everyday, like getting pissed cuz someone cuts you off in your car...you chose to be pissed rather than choosing to blow it off and just wave and keep your good mood intact...every thing that happens to you is filtered by you and a reaction is chosen. Next time choose a different response and you'll have a different experience...so yeah it's a mind game and you can either win or lose in every moment that comes your way...like right now, choose to enjoy yourself...all day...even when things get hairy...choose to find the humor in it all...choose to be kinder...choose to be gracious, generous, witty, accomodating, agreeable etc...and you'll start really digging your life!|`|AA12080730	No the world is not a mind game. Mind is the reason why person suffers in this world. If brain (intellegence) has a control over mind the this life will seems easier.See an anlogy.    Compare this living body with a horse-cart. Senses are like horses, if uncontrolled, can take u in the direction anywhere they like. Mind is like the rope used to control the horse, which should b ultimately in control of the driver(intellegence). The cart is compared to this body and the passenger is the soul which will be happy if all these components of this journey (life) will work in co ordination.
