She is young and in the growing process; she needs to give her body time to get use to the changes she should be going through.

La8dhcwzaa	The lack of answers here prove that most guys don't even know what they want, other than the physical aspects, of course.<br>  Unless ur a guy like me, a (video game) nerd or something similar to that, most guys don't and/or won't care to learn to appreciate things that make a girl truly beautiful; humor, brains, humility, honesty, loyalty and so many more things because guys like me are the ones who have to sit and watch other girls who deserve better, get hurt by the ones who just want to get busy for peer-status...It's shameful on our end and the good guys suffer for it too unfortunately!<br>  What most guys find "cute" is usually what they want to find "sexy" and then "have sex" with that something sexy, period.<br>  So its up to you really, and what kind of guy you want to notice you.<br>  You can work at being physically attractive or unphysically attractive, meaning like just finding that 1-of-a-kind emotional bond with someone, or even something in between.|`|0EVOAb0qaa	I look for their smiles
E9CiH4eDaa	You should try to be friends with him first and then get to know him and he can get to know you so you can be for sure if he likes you. You can't force anybody to like you, it's nearly impossible. just go up to him and start a random conversation with him.
zzaScg0haa	The only way I could tell you for sure if he likes you would be if he asked you out
6ulA6MVVaa	haha well im in highschool (girl) and i somewhat know what u are tlaking aboutt....i once went to a concert and i fetl an "atrraction" to this random guyy and yes i wanted 2 get to know him but yes i also wanted 2 get in is pants lol.....i did end up hooking up with him that night, but we did actually go on a date (after hooking up hehe) and i got to knw him and hes a really cool guy and only last month (after a good 7 month relationship) he broke up with me.....but thtats not the point, all im trying to sayy is that i know how u feel and yes i am attracted 2 guys who says "i want u" cuz i think its sexy eeven if he doesnt "like" me, if i just feel like getting some than thats what ill do. depends on my moood haha.k lol ima stop typing now cuz i bet nobody even understands what im talking about...i hope this helps and if u have any more quesitons or just wanna chat email me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com :)|`|t8Qfdx9jaa	i think its hot when a guy says i want you.<br>  i agree with everything your saying.<br>  why lie and say you like someone when you jst wanna get some.- not trying to sound like a slut,because im not <br>  but before you say that to someone you should makesure they know you just wanna hookup and that youre not in love with them.<br>  lol|`|xDlBM6N6aa	If a guy says that, no matter what, it probably means he wants to have sex with her, but as you say it's otherwise and you dont want to do that till you know her.<br>  <br>  You should say that you think she's cute or something, not "I want you".  That's just my opinion though.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	LOL pretty damn random to me, but why is it so much important in guys that physically Attraction is the most absurd thing in the world why can't they just like a girls personality instead what is soo hard about that|`|uLyBjMonaa	so whats the question? when you say you want a girl does it mean you just want to **** her??|`|pqSGMukvaa	u sound like a shallow jerk...but i wouldnt know<br>  ...dont listen to me|`|5809c406b87c68be7f3c5ecc70c41e8faa	hahahah.... your answer will freak a lot of sensitive girls out.  It sounds kinda too straight without any sophisticate thoughts if you really liked her.  When someone says I want you sounds too primitive like kinder kid's talk so egostic.  What you need to say is beating around bush and a bit suave way with boy's tone like as " hey do you have time on ...., would you like to have some time hanging out to watch some movie or activity.."  that would be sounded more rational and euphamismistic way to express how much he is interested in that girl.  No no no saying " I want you".  Hahahah... just remember.  You are a fully grown boy and you need to delicate the words what you said no matter in relationship or in communication.
n7cG31Qpaa	You don't have to do it nicely, there's no "nice" way to dump someone. Hence the word "dump". You don't have to be mean either, just tell him the truth. Maybe he'll say O.K. and it will be over. Maybe he'll have a melt down and then it will be over. Maybe when you talk to him he'll realize he's been a jerk and you can decide what to do then. The main thing is to talk to him.|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	"Hey, i'm sorry, but I just want to move on, and meet other people, and give you that chance, too" if he asks why then tell him that you think he wasn't spending enough time with you..etc.|`|HAgd5asNaa	Tell him how you feel, then just say "Goodbye."|`|1JVAZbt7aa	why do u have to do it nicely?<br>  if u have a reason, just do it.<br>  he will know why.....|`|06O8FaOjaa	SHES TELL HYM HOW YU REALLY FEEL AND TELL HYM THINGS ARENT WORKIN OUT|`|6HP348pAaa	Just say "Hey, can I talk to you?

HKkbqlIuaa	Sounds like she wants to have sex, yes. However, you know the warnings about online dating. I mean she could be a married woman who is bored w/sex at home, but won't physically cheat on her husband. Why don't you ask her? Sounds like she really wants some @ss. =] Good luck!|`|cj41cz2Iaa	Sorry this may be disapointing, but I think she is....I mean come on who does that? Why would anyone do that.... if she was normal she wouldn't be a creeper and do that online. If she really lived close to you, you guys would of been hanging out in person for awhile, but I think one night she is just gonna come to your door asking for it... What kind of person is that.. if you ask me she is a total Sl*t...

There is nothing more beautiful than a sincere and humble apology from a man to make a woman feel loved.  There is nothing loving about asserting the last word simply because one is the man.  Last time I checked, the husband is to love his wife.|`|n7U9YqBSaa	It depends on the context of each discussion and who is right in that subject etc.<br>  <br>  And a real man would consider his wife's points very kindly also,, I know so because that is how my dh is.. ! <br>  <br>  It all comes down to fairness.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	No. No one should have final say it should be a joint agreement.

If a mutual decision cannot be made, then compromise is in order.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, you each give 50%.  Other times, one of you gives 100%.  Marriage is about picking your battles, and knowing when to lay down.<br>  <br>  ...Oh, and FYI, if my husband ever "put his foot down" to me, I'd laugh in his face.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	No.  The thing with being an adult is, you get to have different opinions on things.  She's not a child and he's not the parent.  Sometimes you actually have to...sit down for this one...compromise.  I know, it's a scary thought.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	No.  A couple should come to an agreement.  Weigh the pros and cons, look at what is best for the family and then make a reasonable and rational choice together.|`|AA12185240	It really depends on what the disagreement is|`|3irrWRUWaa	no. this is 2009. it doesn't matter who has last say. the person who is right should have last say.|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	YES YES YES and finally YES|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Since when.

It's always been that way for me. -.- *sigh*|`|ry0J4oo2aa	Ha Ha!<br>  Dont' worry. In my 14 years, I've liked a total of 3 guys. The first one was when I was in preschool. I liked him for a little while until another girl came along and took away all of his attention. After that moment, I decided I would become an expert on guys.<br>  The secone one started in kinder garden. I liked him even when I moved to another state. then two years after that! I ended up liking him a total of 9 years! Pretty Bad...|`|YmOyrfn4aa	I used to have that problem. I really loved this boy, well at the time I thought I did. He was my boyfriend for about a month and then he broke up with me, over text message. But yeah after we broke up we still talked and hung out in the summer practically everyday. Well I fell right in love with him all over again. But the thing was, he never acted like he liked me or anything. When he wasn't around his friends he would kind of flirt with me but when his friends came back around once again, he was back to the regular Sidney (his name). He hurt me ALOT. I really wanted things to work out between us. And he knew I had strong feelings for him and he kinda just ignored them. He would always ask me when we were going to have sex, but I never did. It hurt though Because I really thought he was different and then he would tell me "I don't like you, but I care about you." and for some reason at that moment I knew our relationship as friends wasn't going to go anywhere. I knew I had to move on. It hurt like hell because I started ignoring his texts and his fone calls. But I had too. It was the only way to get over him. Til this day he texts me and asks me when he gonna hit and stuff like that. And it just gets on my nerves because he didn't even care about my feelings. But yeah I moved on from him and went to high school and that made it easier cause now we were attending different schools. But I went to high school and met my current boyfriend who Ive been with for 5 wonderful months and I truly do love him. I don't think I love Sidney. I think I thought I did and was just sprung over him because I know I didn't feel the way I feel about my boyfriend about him. So yeah. . .|`|yv3hBhbGaa	yes. and it hurts like hell. dont know why i put myself through it but i do lol. ive liked him for four years. am i pathetic or what?|`|JTwiYjUPaa	of course....it happens at least once or twice in your life...if it happens more than that it could mean you are desperate for the wrong guys...|`|5R0uovhKaa	:( I'm sad.

NmfEaN3Uaa	We love it!! It takes the pressure off of us....and we really appreciate it. <br>  <br>  Imagine being a guy....we are expected to make all the moves and be the one to ask you out....BUT....girls are so confusing (you know you are lol) and girls love to flirt so its hard to tell if a girl really likes you or is just flirty. And we, guys, are terrified of rejection so most the time we chicken out and never ask the girl out! lol<br>  <br>  Ask him.|`|HsWSfEsJaa	its different to certain guys but i think thats cute|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Guys when girls make the first move........?<br>  Is it intimidating or attractive?? That depends on whether I like the girl or want nothing to do with her. If I like her then it is attractive. If I have already decided I want nothing to do with her, then it puts pressure on me. Do I be cruel and brush her off or tell her what I think of her? Or do I ignore her and hope she just goes away?|`|S0QQ6D92aa	lol last time that happened i didn't really mind.. i mean i wanted to say it, but she was first, like in a debate, but..then i told her, wait..i got a better idea...and then asked her out, made her laugh a bit, but i got it through, and told her, i wasn't ...didn't have enough courage lol...im weak haha jp jp
wHsbUeCKaa	Hm, I'm not sure I believe you. I think you are just bored and making up a question. Am I right or wrong?|`|7PGxqRfZaa	You got what you wanted from her. You never loved her. So stop lieing to yourself and her and break it off with her. She will be very upset that you used her the way you did. Good luck. your going to need it.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Welcome to reality when you have sex too young and when you're too immature to handle the consequences.<br>  <br>  Tell her you just wanted sex, you don't love her and let her go. It will be blunt, direct and clear. You have to be. <br>  <br>  Like it or not, you used her. You didn't love her...you most likely didn't know her very well. People do not stop loving the person they are with after they have sex with them for the first time. You screwed up. Big time.<br>  <br>  But it will be worse if you stay with her and continue to lie to her and make her think that you like/love her.<br>  <br>  Be blunt, tell her the truth and let her go so she can find someone who will actually love her and care about her and she can start to heal from this.|`|Ekzym4kYaa	wow im the same way <br>  the hit it and quit it type lol<br>  tell her ya'll can still be friends works fine for me|`|wBx51f5paa	Wow that pretty much sucks, and that's sad!!. <br>  you just have to tell her.|`|RJynYf6aaa	youre not fooling anyone. you never loved her you just wanted her for sex. youre an ***|`|CmiV46zRaa	Well honestly, I had this same problem, and from one guy to another, it's all in you're head. You wanted sex so bad that when you finally got it, you lost interest ..that is kinda low, but it happens. What i did was hangout like you did before and not rely on the sexual factor so much. Enjoy her friendship like you once did and then decide whether or not you 'stopped loving her.'|`|itLS5Ualaa	hahhahahahahhahaahhah. thats funny. no mater what you do it will look like you where using her and she will know it. dood go out for al least another month because that will make her feel bad. or you can get her to brake up with you!!!!!!|`|lHK13vqwaa	DO NOT BE A JERK<br>  please, really if you two went that far, and she trusted you that much. it means she will fall hard.<br>  <br>  you must try harder, explain your feelings to her and say you want to work on the relationship. don't just dumb her.

Its all about the hunt and the way guys minds are geared is to show that we are superior to other guys.|`|vyGyLV7paa	no guys don't like it when a girl thinks they are hot them, it only gets annoying if the girl is a jerk to them ( to make it obvious that the girl doesnt like the guy)|`|6H21XgA6aa	Because we feel we missed an opportunity or maybe "we" think we wont find anyone else|`|EDBMw3AVaa	...your judging every single guy in the world by 1, 2, or maybe 3 guys that have done this? theyre probably f*gs anyways|`|NK6AtTWBaa	we go after what we cant get.  thats how the whole "playin hard to get" thing started.|`|P3s3UIlcaa	is this a question or a comment?|`|bH6KUo3jaa	because.......we..........dont.....care.|`|TweZlF73aa	I don't mind it personally, i had three or four girls like me and i  told them how i felt and i just wanted to be friends, and they said it was fine, but now there like best friends or something to me.

zzaScg0haa	Absolutely not
wAqfyXNAaa	I know if I liked a girl and she gave me one I would love it and only show my close friends just cause of how happy I was and if any of them laughed I would get mad at them. If he likes you he wont laugh but find it the sweetest thing ever!!!|`|Boq2rqMGaa	dont be shy. hes just a guy. if you show the courage to go up to him and say that you like him hes going to be really proud of you. guys love courageous girls. so just one day, walk up to him, start a casual conversation "hey whats up" blah blah. then just say i think your cute, i kinda like you. see his reaction? maybe its the same, maybe he was being shy too?! then whoa, whaddya know your going out, and its all because of you :) life is too short to live being scared. take chances, be a dare devil. best wishes =D|`|cMyPQ90vaa	i understand that your shy and all but if i was you i would talk to him when ya'll are alone and just let him know how you feel and if you really like him you shouldn't wait because someone else might come along and scoop him up than you'll be sorry that you didn't tell him...my opinion is just put your shyness aside and tell him.... good luck|`|yWIkkmN8aa	DO NOT WRITE HIM A LETTER!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  i've done that before and it ended very badly. :(<br>  <br>  he showed all of his friends and i was really embarrassed and sad. <br>  <br>  then i asked if he could just give me the letter back, and he never did.|`|ygiVZ5FSaa	ya girl is r boys are like that that will just add to his ego trust me u dont want to go down that path tell him face to face or move on or what u could do is flirt with him act like u cant stand him that way ull draw more attenion to him m360|`|Hl0e3p4laa	Listen, u should text him or talk to him or send him a note but don't put your name do this i am a advance|`|5nyei93saa	Don't write a letter, others will see it even if he doesn't show them.<br>  get to know him better before you tell him how you feel.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Well that's the chance you take when it comes to these kinds of things. Talk to him before writing love notes to him. Talk to him face to face and tell him how you feel. So what if he and his stupid friends laugh at you. Just tell all of your girl friends that one of his friends told you he has a small dick. lol. Good luck and never let others have this kind of power over you or your life.|`|MAicuZUGaa	Don't write a letter; it'll seem like you've been thinking way too much about it or are really formal and he'll either think it's stupid or it'll scare him off, particularly if he doesn't like you (but just for the record most people will go out w/ anyone who asks them out). You should either email him or just ask him out.|`|m2eHPeciaa	well, if u text him, he'll show his Friends for sure. i wouldn't tell him personally jus yet. i'd wait for him to show interest in me first, then make a counter move (if that's what u really feel) trust me, i've been though this in my past.|`|s6BzNXRfaa	sounds like you'd be embarrassing yourself, try telling him to his face so you either get clearly rejected and can forget about it or have a new boy.|`|M2MjJz9qaa	just get to know him, talk to him more often in person, just be chill about it dont flip out and loose your cool|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	text him :D

Ambos sabem o que est?o fazendo.... Minha pergunta para você é: Você se arrependeu do que fez? Ou sente prazer e fica louca quando está com ele?<br>  <br>  Se você se arrependeu, tente apagar este acontecimento da sua memória, e tente n?o apanha-lo mais vezes sozinho em casa né? lol<br>  Se você quer ter algo com ele, nem que seja só a nivel sexual, você tá no seu direito. Ambos s?o livres e desempedidos! Tem é que conversar muito bem com ele, perceber o que ele realmente quer de você!<br>  Provavelmente ele te vê como uma linda brasileira de 19 anos, e n?o deve pegar uma como você faz tempo!! Mas fala com ele...conversem. <br>  Mas se fosse a você, tentava n?o contar a ninguém de sua familia.... Concerteza v?o te apontar o dedo, como esses caras fazem aqui no yahoo.<br>  <br>  Boa sorte para voce!!<br>  <br>  Beijo ;)|`|MWjNp6y3aa	So basically your question could read...<br>  <br>  "I had sex with my friends dad and don't know how to tell her that I like it." Right?<br>  <br>  Well if you don't care how the family is going to take it then just tell her you are into her dad and that you both got together and wanted to tell her so you wouldn't be keeping secrets from her. Give her time to think about it and let her know you want to still be cool with her. Just let her know you don't want a relationship with your dad. She would most likely jump to that conclusion after you tell her you got with her dad. Tell her you both just wanted to hump and that it is nothing more than good old sex.<br>  <br>  To those who say desperate or w/e it isn't desperate to have fun with whoever you see fit to have fun with. Get over it you prudes. Guys get with older women way more than you think. It is a good learning experience for both genders. As long as it doesn't turn out to be a long term thing it won't harm you. Not saying long term doesn't work, it just usually doesn't.<br>  <br>  PS...you can email me if you want. You sound like a fun loving girl. You also look very good. I have always been interested in getting to know a brazillian girl.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	42 is not old guy he still strong, but is there is any feelings.... if yes then have it on the public and have him.|`|KDW2tANfaa	Why tell her? Keep it between you and the dad.. a little secret affair.|`|wkyNWtfAaa	my feedback is: you're aslut.
1eh0921yaa	the plan is ok but how about<br>  casually asking her yourself|`|SRnPaHBoaa	just ask her if she wants to go with you and go from there|`|FWsv3Schaa	yeah thats good. i hope it works out! good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine on my page?|`|0W6lIfYVaa	i think she'll see through this plan the second her friend tells her it was you thatt was actually wondering not her. so your gonna have to do it the old fashioned way that it seems you planned out prior. she'll think more of you this way in the end when she does say yes|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Her friend will mention that you had been asking about her anyway...|`|9DV26vk0aa	just do it you have nothing to lose if she turns you down that the worst possible things that can happen|`|jvvTybx4aa	Hmm, that sounds good enough. :)<br>  Good luck|`|74gPuaXMaa	NO. Don't do. You will not look confident enough for the girl to even consider you. <br>  <br>  Just ask her to go to prom with you as a friend. You can still be friends no, and go to prom together if she says yes. And hey, maybe she likes you, but don't worry. It all happens in due time.|`|Kti9D3BJaa	one thing you should always remember when dealing with girls is that they tell each other everything no matter what one girl says to you the other will find out in the end. you would be better off taking a risk. your plan is great other than that. :] good luck.|`|RwHbF367aa	You should ask her your self. Using somebody else to ask for you is never a good Idea.|`|sxoG0haeaa	Well, she excepted your asking to the prom (you did ask her, right?)....So this probably means that she would like to date you and does like you.|`|2UFhModAaa	If she's going to prom with you, she MUST like you! I say take a shot. Go up to her, and say, "hey, i was wondering if you wanted to go get a bite to eat on ______" (day of week)<br>  <br>  hope i helped! <3|`|6gdEKcehaa	hunh?<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtUQATmWszFSvEehudXTzozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304172448AAEiePo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|R9tUWsXnaa	No, bad plan, it shows you don't have the guts.<br>  <br>  Just ask her.|`|pEZr6MBHaa	Haha!  It's so funny how complicated this is in high school.  Normally, I'd just say go for it and ask her out.  However, you wouldn't want to jeopardize your date for prom.  If she said yes to go with you to prom, then there's a good chance she likes hanging out with you.  Your plan to ask her friend sounds fine -- provided you trust her friend.  You never know how people will twist things, but if you're nervous that asking her to hang out on a date prior to prom might freak her out, then seeing if her friend will ask her what her thoughts are might be the best, non-chalant way to go.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you have a good feeling that this girl (the one you asked to prom) is into you, then you could just ask her directly to hang out for ice cream or something.  If she likes you, then trust me, she'll be thrilled.|`|OtDPZO3vaa	Dude, don't ask her friends to do what you should do for yourself. IF you want to go out before that prom date, just ask her. If she's not interested, I'd be saving the prom money and find someone more interested in you.<br>  If she's agreed to prom, she probably would go out earlier, too. If not, I'd be suspicious that she was using you for prom...|`|noeLSuTKaa	Its a good way for the easy way out.....when you just confront her and be brave about it then you will feel good for being brave even if she sais no...if she doesnt accept you after that then just let her be because she isnt somone to like if she won't want to be friends with someone that is as brave to confront their fears of asking a girl to prom........trust me, being straightforward is hot (truthfully straightforward) <br>  <br>  :]]]|`|if65xvOLaa	good idea. also, you could say wanna hang out before prom to get to know eachother a bit more, that way prom will be even better...my date did that and i said yes...it also made me like him a bit more.|`|JHXAtG3eaa	Ask her to "hang out" at a movie. Maybe go out to eat and stuff "as friends" continue to flirt with her and eventually make a move. Don't be a sissy and don't wait to long.|`|kBlkOJ8caa	no. it's not a good idea.<br>  YOUR IN FRICKEN HIGH SCHOOL!<br>  Get the balls to ask her.<br>  Your only going to get rejected if something goes bad.<br>  it happens to every one. just ask her.|`|0rzSbCMVaa	bad idea, just confront her. Even if she says no, then you can squeeze a boob and run. Either way, you win! =)|`|Ft4yOd7maa	Good plan =D|`|OJxApbGeaa	i would say try a date if it doesn'tt work ask her 2 go as friends|`|Jmxje0wVaa	Go for it, niger :)|`|giuzEeucaa	sounds good

PVb3iiaAaa	dude... just ask her.... girls love to be asked out it makes us feel special and dont be nervous.... hahaha girls can sence when a guy is nervous... let it flow out of your lips like a regular subject wood.... good luck...|`|ws4c4GDgaa	Ok first of all would you say ur a cute guy because if not then you have no chance. JK!  Ok now i'll be serious well if you like her so much than you should ask her out. Like my friend always says "The worst they can say is no."  But hey I'm a girl and i don't have to deal with the stress of asking people out because the guy usually beats the girl to it. And just to let you know girls love being asked out it them feel special. Wish you the best of luck:]|`|R9tUWsXnaa	Lad, you need to get comfortable around her first off, at the point in which she isn't so much of a girl, but more like a friend.<br>  <br>  Then, when you guys are comfortable enough, ask her.<br>  <br>  Try to flirt with her more, and go out of your way for her, but not too much.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	what is it you want help with asking her out.|`|obKrWyQlaa	Girl's like a guy with courage, and don't worry, we know it's difficult to ask, and we really respect a guy with the courage to do it.  Why do you think it's so hard for us to refuse?  (Only the horribly mean girls find enjoyment in refusing a guy)  So, I'm assuming that she's a nice girl since you like her.  So, it's in your best interest to ask her.<br>  <br>  Just take a deep breath and ask.

Chances are, she'll say yes.Good luck!!! =)|`|njibdpT1aa	Just be yourself. The worst thing to do is let your guy friends find out because then they'll tell her.|`|FWsv3Schaa	talk to her and try and get her number. then text her or whatever and get to know her more. then when you both feel comfortable around each other just ask her out. good luck!<br>  <br>  answer mine on my page?|`|pe69KF3Taa	you've heard this more times than days you've been alive...just ask her. if you don't take action, you'll regret it in the future and wonder "what if she'd have said yes?" if you don't ask and do nothing, you'll be returned with nothing. if you take action, you'll be returned with a maybe. nothing vs. maybe, your call man.

qNMfaJ4Raa	Listen to yourself, not to anyone on here. No one knows you like you know you. Sex is really fun and great especially if you do it with the right person, but if waiting for marriage is important to you, you should stick to your morals.|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	Why are you asking us, it's completely up to you. If you already lost your virginity to a girl you're not committed to, then might as well do it again.<br>  <br>  But if you kept it for so long, then you better not waste it after keeping it for so long, especially to a girl you don't even know is into committment or even actually interested in you.<br>  <br>  Update: I personally say keep, but that doesn't mean, you need to listen to me. Lose your virginity, but hopefully, you're not at the age where your parents will need to pay for any pregnancies that are bound to occur.|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	Dude.......the answer to this depends on what plans u have for your life.

13wVtd08aa	Well, I would recommend you had a sit down with her parents and her. Calmly present your point of view and offer options and conditions as to when, where and how you will be spending time with their daughter - ie offer to visit at their house (not in her room) and have supervised outings. This may not sound like much fun but if you care about each other you should be fine with spending time together however you can.<br>  <br>  You need to remember that parents are naturally protective of their kids (which is a really good thing) but sometimes this protectiveness hinders the kids' emotional development and maturity. Just don't point this out to her parents... they will probably not take to well to that!<br>  <br>  Oh and I can't stress this enough... if and when you have the sit down, speak calmly. If you or your girlfriend throws a tantrum it'll be over right then and there. Listen to their point of view and offer yours, and if at the end of it all they still refuse to let you date their daughter, just agree to remain friends until she's old enough to date and enjoy being a teenager without the complications of a relationship ;-)<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out well.|`|ipRPrvzxaa	offer the option for the dad to come with you guys and just not interfere|`|m2eHPeciaa	mmm yeah i'd have to agree 13 is young.|`|erUV0m8gaa	i know how you feel. when i was 13 i had the same problem.<br>  just let them know that you are not going to do anything stupid.<br>  and have you even meet the parents that might help just go out to dinner or something but show them that you like her|`|aUx61NFTaa	try going on double dates like you with ur gf and a friend with his gf also u could ask ur parents and hers to go to the movies 4 a while see how that works out|`|SxxshKVjaa	Wait a year, or maybe two.

cMrieID4aa	You're probably just so nervous around her that your brain dies on you. Happens all the time. What I would do is: 1) write down what you talk about during the IM, email, etc conversations, so that you can bring them back up in person, 2) write down a list of topics to discuss with her that SHOW THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HER LIFE, 3) just simply be yourself and go with the flow. ;)<br>  <br>  Number 3 should be followed no matter what.

fyvTctOyaa	i know someone exactly like that!<br>  but even though you and your best friend dont consider that as flirting(neither to i) it is and the girls or guys are probably just jelouse because like they might think your stealing the people they like. but i think the best way to find out if your flirting to much is just like think do all the guys you hug like you, or alot of them like you. cuz if they do then you probably are flirting alot more than you should, but you should still flirt a little cuz its funn!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  have fun|`|afBbv2eeaa	yes|`|AA12116047	is your name Ivy?|`|HqoOjAHVaa	yes u are u must have failed im 14 and in the 9th grade|`|uiGx0rPVaa	I know a girl that hugs a ton of people everyday!  People start huge rumors bout her saying she does pole dancing and is a s****. She just ignores them and befriends them and buys people stuff to seem innocent to them. DO NOT DO THIS.<br>  <br>  Ignore them is the key to solve that prob. Do u wear clothes that show a bit too much cleavage? maybe that's the prob or that people may be jealous of your free character? Move on girl! :)|`|ZaTLsifIaa	don't worry about the other people in your school, they're probably just jealous because they aren't as social and don't have as many guy friends. honestly, don't let those people get you down, once you get in high school everything will change and get better for you, as long as you have friends that you love and that understand you, you're set for life.|`|Ra6RZyDfaa	Just tell them your not a **** and that u just like to hug people, or ignore it.

So they obviously are immature and are jealous of you. They are immature because the labeling thing is so overrated. And i can tell they are jealous because they wouldn't be calling you that they want the guys they just cant have so they take it out on someone who has "guy friends".<br>  Bottom line, Don't care what they think. Its just stupid, Forget about 'em.|`|Z55EAvDMaa	Ohh, that's awful that people think that! I'm with you completely-hugs are the best!<br>  You could always try explaining to whoever thinks that about you why it is that you hug so many people. More often than not, other kids will say those things out of jealousy. Overall, just don't let it bother you. Their opinions shouldn't bring you down-especially if it's because you're just hugging people!|`|sCv94Riyaa	I'm 14 also. every one has their own flirting styles, it just depends who you are. so hugging isnt bad at all. maybe just tone things down a little bit, remember, your going to be in high school soon, people will think totally different. & they'll eventually mature (:|`|t3vFy9R8aa	As long as you know what you are and what you stand for, then you don't have to convince anyone of anything. Be yourself and ignore all the jealous people around you.|`|3CBWubtAaa	that's their problem <br>  they're probably just jealous<br>  you can't be considered a **** because you hug guys and hang around them<br>  it would be different if you were doing "stuff" with them but hugging is like nothing|`|bNEJxVA2aa	<b>well..ur dEFiNAtElY NOt AHh **** !!<br>  iM tHA SAME WAY giRRl !!!<br>  MAYbEE U sHOUld tRY NOt hUGGiN UR GUy fRiENdS SO MUCh <br>  tHAt miGht hElP !!

eh66D16Caa	Honestly the answer is inside of you and no one could tell u if its love or lust.<br>  Ask yourself if u want to have sex with him to get closer to him or to share a special bond or just cuz u wanna have sex?<br>  <br>  3 years is a along time so you must have some type of feelings for him.<br>  If it was just lust then u would not lasted that long.<br>  <br>  You need to clear things about about how you really feel. Maybe give yourself a break and take some time off from your relationship to think about things..<br>  And also, try to meet other guys if he's the only guy u think about and no other guy seems like the right one then try to work it out.<br>  <br>  Other than that, let him know how u feel. Keeping it to yourself would just make things worse.<br>  Do you love him so much that if he hurt u and made u cry then asked for sex and u'd have it with him cuz u love him<br>  or <br>  Do u not care if he hurts u and makes u cry as long as he has sex with u<br>  <br>  And depending on how u feel u'll know if its love or lust.|`|jUzzDOitaa	just stop with him and move on you'll thank me|`|Sma3ekSOaa	I'm sorry but I think that it may just be lust|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	naaa u still in that I like a lot! stage|`|dTde75UDaa	I honestly don't think he is right for you when you break up and then make up. It seems like a love-hate relationship you got going on there. <br>  But its totally up to you! Just talk about it with him! Ask him what he thinks :)<br>  And id he hurts your feelings and makes you cry...oh he is definitely not right for you. But maybe something is going on at home that is making him act the way he is.|`|R9tUWsXnaa	Babe, if you don't like him and just want to have "sexual intercourse" with him, then there is no love, but lust.<br>  <br>  Face it.<br>  <br>  If you liked him, you could name off 5-10 things you like, not physically, but mentally, like personality.|`|kYPiU1BJaa	The way u spaced it and everything makes it look like a poem lol.

Real love isn't all about sex, and I think you should know that. Being attracted to him is a major sign of lust because it means you like his looks, not his personality, the way he is. <br>  <br>  If he hurts your feelings, then he isn't a good guy for you. Quit being with him and find someone who'll actually take care and respect you for you.|`|9mcJBaUwaa	I guess you love him very deeply, and im guessing you like him more than just his looks, if he truly makes you laugh then, it means his personality fit yours. Remember this, no one is perfect. As you are attracted to him, he may be attracted to other girls, mayby he's trying to control himself but you can't limit him that he will only look at you, speak to you, and smile at you not any other girls. Does it matter whether you're in lust or love? If you love him so much, love him, if he loves you thats good, if he doesn't treasure the good moments forever, let the bad pass. Move on<br>  It is painful to see someone you like, laugh,have fun with another person and not you. Nothing is perfect, just remember you don't own him. If you truly love him...you will make sure that he is happy even when your in pain.   <br>  <br>  For me, I don't know if the girl I like, like me, she sometimes get annoyed by me but it seems that she's happy with me around. It makes my day, just to see her smile, even if she's with another guy. (well not as in flirting with the guy)<br>  <br>  Am i in love or lust?   To me does it truly matter? As long as I love her?|`|m0M76xW8aa	It sounds like lust. I mean, you really don't seem like you're compatible with him. The only thing you want is his bod. Other than that, he sounds like he's done nothing but cause you stress. I would look for another guy who has more than just looks. That way, both of you benefit from getting to meet new people.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, <br>  ~MexiMidge|`|AfwYNFN5aa	Could you see yourself together forever? Do you see other guys as not attractive anymore? If so I think you are in love. but if not it's a lust.|`|wUh8Nt0laa	lust.|`|ArIaRu5paa	i think it's lust. you still have feelings but i dont think you LOVE him. You know he's not perfect for you and you know you would probably be better off with someone else. You practically said that same thing: you don't want him back.<br>  <br>  so if you don't want him back, don't take him back and don't go back. In doing so you're just giving him an open opportunity to use you. sure the sex is great and if you just want a friends with benefits relationship with him then that's fine.<br>  <br>  But don't confuse love and lust.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Raging hormones.

AA11172374	When you don't want to be with anyone else and are ready to be<br>  exclusive, (and it sounds like you are) just ask her how she feels<br>  about it.

However, he had the right to find someone new, just like you do. You can still talk to him as friends and hang out some, but don't try to come between him and his new girlfriend. It will just come back to haunt you.

9pcZLomIaa	Why don't you talk to him about it. So he doesn't think you are avoiding him. Maybe your just not ready to tell him you love him. How long have you been dating. Because it could take a little bit to get comfortable with tell him you love him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!! :)
ry0J4oo2aa	Well... most church guys ( don't mean to use titles) are sweet to everyone. Unlike a normal guy, when he's around a girl he likes, he's ver very VERY shy.<br>  In your case, it looks like he's just being a friend.<br>  Sorry to say but, he's not into you.  And That's OK.

PKRZtwyHaa	then hes a door knob|`|PJZRGsc3aa	he feels more confident with people he knows|`|uMV6jwZnaa	guys r stupid|`|jmlAmr3gaa	No, he's just not confident about flirting in the face of your judgment AND your friends' judgment.  If you want to build a relationship with a guy, spend time alone with him.|`|VI3pZSKjaa	your pretty :)<br>  <br>  wow that sounds majorly pedo-ish<br>  <br>  play it out a little more. if he keeps doing it with his friends it might just be a showy off kinda thing|`|btHvO5ijaa	i dont kno i kno someone that like me 2 but i dont like him in that way|`|CsjhdpJSaa	The only reason he only says a "hi" in front of your friends is bc he is intimidated. It is alot harder, not to mention uncomfortable to flirt and make convo infront of their crush's friends. :) It is easier for him to do this infront of his friends bc their HIS friends and he wants to look cool. Haha. Guys.... Sounds like he really likes you. Make sure to flirt back so he knows. g'luck. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just read the part bout how he and yourfriends don't like each other. This probably has alot to do with it. He's most likely embarrassed and knows he'll be judged/ made fun of by your friends. Hope I helped.|`|7rCASaZIaa	He is out of his comfort zone with your friends, I think. The only way to help him get over it is to get him more involved with your friends. When they become his friends too, he will feel better about himself and have less fear of being an outsider.|`|bNmrZOwQaa	he feels brave when he's around people he knows and he's too shy to say the same things when you're around your friends and he's alone...try and arrange a meeting time or something or just find someone else|`|3oA010Npaa	get new friends. sorry but i really dont have any advice acept only hang out with his friends and not your friends at the same time... and im guessing that guy, is just shy around your friends... he <3 u!! <br>  <br>  <br>  XD<br>  <br>  hoped i helped|`|MhA1BFRdaa	just be cool. be cool.|`|pwtmMGMWaa	I dont like his attitude, he probably has a bet with his frs, dont turn him off yet, see how he treats u when ur alone with him, then tell him what u think|`|dsxErJZIaa	he prob doesnt really like you that much|`|hhr3A1bSaa	maybe he is just shy. just keep on being friends with him|`|3ojkXjE5aa	honestly, many guys get really nervous when approaching a girl when she is hanging out with her friends. Most guys are afraid of making a horrible first impression on the friends of their crush. But what you really should do is get him alone, and have a heart to heart talk with him. If your feelings aren't out in the open, tell him the truth. Introduce him to your friends as well, try and let them get to know each other a little better so he isn't as timid around them.|`|63Af6b66aa	Okay i had the same problem and i still do but after a few days of talking to him he gave me his number and we started talking even more dont listen to that stupid rule that a guy has to call or text you first because i started texting first and the guy i like is already saying to me that he likes me <br>  just be your self dont change for somebody because then you'll just be pleaseing some other person and you may feel unhappy <br>  make sure he doesnt have a girl friend well that doesnt really matter anyways but it does if you ask him out and he has a girl friend of corse but that doesnt mean you shouldnt talk to him just be your self and act natural <br>  hoped i helped you best of luck to you :)|`|VdCuj28Xaa	Don't listen to them. If your "crush" doesn't like your friends, then i advise that you try to get them together more. Trust me, you can't have a BF and then your friends who hate each other. it just makes things bad for the person in the middle, (you). the more time you spend just hanging out with all of them the more they will be able to warm up to each other.|`|KVaLojuwaa	Ok first of all i am not trying to be mean. But it seems like to me it could be 2 options. The first one could be that he is trying to act cool or impress his friends and don't like your friends. Or he could just feel more comfortable flirting with you around his friends and don't feel comfortable with your friends yet. Maybe he just has to warm up to them . You never know. But I wouldn't be worried|`|RmFltNsaaa	you're making this a huge deal, and it's not. just because he says "hey" around your friends doesn't mean he doesn't like your friends. maybe he's shy.  maybe you're looking for too many subliminal messages and guys really aren't into those. so try to stop reading into everything he does. it's really unnecessary.  just give it up.|`|AA10565171	he might just be intimidated.<br>  like afraid he's going to say something wrong in front of your friends and make an *** out of himself.<br>  <br>  if you guys are close enough you could be really forward and straight up ask him why he "seems shy" when he's not around his friends. that way he wont feel like you're accusing him of anything but he'll know that you notice these details about him :]|`|B9P4W3Wtaa	if you really like him then you should try to hang out with him even with your friends or maybe just you two. and about the whole him only flirting with you when he is with his friends thing well maybe he is just trying to be a show-off dont let that bug you. good luck <3<3<3|`|inP5EIysaa	maybe he is embarassed to flirt around your friends.

That is if your friends mean more to you than your crush (which will die out eventually).|`|Z55HjeMaaa	hmm yeah it does seem like he doesnt like being around your friends. either his shy to talk to you in front of them or his just doesnt know how to start a conversation since ur with ur gurls. let him make the move|`|VDcyhgtZaa	He probaly wants to flirt with you when no one is around.

Or maybe she just likes being a bit naughty, nothing wrong with that!|`|AA11447210	No class...not too bright (those pics could turn up anywhere, and at a very inopportune time).<br>  <br>  NEVER post nude or racy pics online unless you don't care who sees them or when.

cMrieID4aa	Obviously, you should trust the guy. He is your partner, and if he says it never happened, then it never happened. It is ridiculously easy to lie on restraining orders, and a bitter woman is completely capable of doing so.<br>  <br>  You like the guy. You are living with him. You are comfortable around him. You trust him. Keep it that way.<br>  <br>  He showed you the restraining order himself. If he had hid it from you, *then* maybe you should have been worried.<br>  <br>  Just trust in him that it didn't happen. It will make the both of you happier, and your relationship stronger. :)
peDJSnQPaa	get a book and ask her if she has ever read it, then small talk from there|`|F0uLexezaa	you're in a book store...whisper|`|lfcbi9cYaa	You've come to the right place my man!  I take it that your interested in her and not intimidated by just asking a general question right?  <br>  <br>  Okay, this is what you do: 1.) You can take the "I need help" route.  Think of a challenging question to ask her... something she won't have to ask someone else for advise on but be vague.  If you don't get the info you want tell her you'll come back the next day when you know more of what you need.  This opens the door.  2.) Tell her you lost something, like a bank card or your keys.  Use that as an excuse to give her your number, or get her number, so if she finds it later you can call her, but be sure to TALK to her first so that you won't be just a stranger but rather a victim who desparately needs her help ;P.  3.) Get a job there!  Even ask a supervisor if you could volunteer for college credit (I dunno?), lol.  4.) Act like your an art student.  Art student's constantly run out of supplies like different leads, erasers, tectured paper, etc... this way, you'll have an excuse to frequent bookstore more often and get familar with her. <br>  <br>  Just some suggestions, gl!|`|zMD0VeOmaa	just be calm and relaxed. try not to be nervous. It's normal to feel a little nervous but if you are shaking or stuttering this is going to make her feel less at ease too.<br>  <br>  I would keep the conversation focused on her. Ask her questions about herself to show you're interested in her. If you think she is an avid reader ask her what her favorite books are. Who knows maybe you both share an interest in a particular genre or author.<br>  <br>  Smile and make eye contact. The most important part of communication is nonverbal. If your body language doesn't match your words the girl will be more wary of you.<br>  <br>  If you can think of something funny to say on the spot by all means do it. I wouldn't try to force humor in a situation though. Try to make it fit in naturally with the conversation. <br>  <br>  Maybe even tease her a bit if she's not the overly sensitive type. (You know like if they have a sign that says ring the bell for service pretend like you are going to do it. Then flash a cocky smile). <br>  <br>  Good luck. I'm sure you'll do great.|`|AA12303797	go up to her and ask her if they have playboy in the magazine section, she'll say "i don't think so" and you'll simply reply "see i didn't think so,  the store manager must have realized that playboy could never compare with your looks." yeah. that right there. or try the "naked man" simply show up naked, 2/3 times she'll sleep with you.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	Your BEST chance is to just talk to her and be confident.

So what if she falls "deeper and deeper"? Perhaps he really digs her in that way...if not, she'll find out soon enough.

q4b4f76Haa	Well, if he brought up the sex topic right away then seems like all he's looking for more of a physical relationship.  A guy who brings up sex right away is only looking to sleep with you.  According to me you should wait at least a few months before sleeping with some guy.  If you sleep with him right away, he will see you as "easy" and once he gets what he wants from you, he will move on to someone else.  You don't have to dump him or stop talking to him, but tell him that you will not sleep with him right away and that he should respect your terms and conditions if he really likes you and wants to be with you

He does not deserve a pretty girl like you.|`|ZxKLOqAlaa	forget him<br>  i kno its hard<br>  but do it|`|FP3aOhnGaa	wow i had a problem too with one of my guy friends. whenever we would hang out at a friend's house and watch movies he would hold my hand and sometimes kiss me and he would flirt a lot. but then he would flirt with a bunch of other girls too. and it got on my nerves. but i knew the only way i would find out exactly what was going on was to ask him about it. so i did. and i got my answer. if this guy was ever your friend in the first place, he would be ok with listening to what you have to say. tell him exactly how you feel. guys might not really like long talks about their feelings, but it's the only way you'll know.|`|b30q2xFMaa	Wow girl.<br>  I'm really sorry.<br>  But if it was me this is what I'd do.<br>  I'd text him and tell him how exactly how  I feel.<br>  It seems like he kinda lead you on..<br>  then just dropped you for a different girl.<br>  But, if doesn't text back.. then just forget him.<br>  Guys can be big jerks. I know how you feel.. I've been trough a lot.<br>  But just forget about him if he doesn't say anything back.<br>  I was pretty much where were you.<br>  But, you know I moved on and forgot about him. and my life is pretty good.<br>  Hope I helped you in some way.<br>  I'm not really all that great at giving the best advice.
LXxxAzIqaa	Become a best friend of a guy.|`|POY6yjBBaa	talk to guys|`|uWdmB0S5aa	flirt
OepV9xNMaa	if he isnt going to grow a pair of balls and talk to you, your going to have to initiate the conversation at first. just walk up and ask him a question about one of your mutual friends or something, ask what he is doing this weekend, anything to get him talking and do not ask questions he can answer with a yes or no.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	well sounds like ur into him as well...  if u like the dude and wanna spice things up, dont wait for him to come up to u. YOU go up to him. say hi and start some small talk. ask him how his day at school was or something very casual that will start a convo. guys can be shy too u know...  dont see y everyone expects them to go first all the time. Good Luck!|`|eccd862f398f745a83ca00f1e1517e3eaa	Your brother's friend might have been joking around that night about it and you all took it a different way which is fine!<br>  He could also be a shy guy too.<br>  I'd try going up to him and starting up a conversation like "Hey (his name)! Hows it going?"<br>  Since you say your shy, try talking to your brother about it and ask him if he can ask about you and that stuff.<br>  If all else fails, your going to have to suck it up and start up a conversation.<br>  <br>  Lol, you don't sound obsessed girl, lot's of girls have the same problem, plus we understand why you would be asking for advice.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you! ;)<br>  <br>  -A.J.|`|XZEaQ4Myaa	try going up to him and starting up a conversation like "Hey (his name)! Hows it going?"
MWjNp6y3aa	How to escape the friend-zone:<br>  <br>  Be more physical, such as hand holding. Just reach for his hand while you walk. This will show him you are trying to be more intimate with him. Physical interactions generally bring you out of the friend zone. If he is ok with hand holding then give him a shoulder rub or something. If he is ok with that then hug on him and look into his eyes and ask him to close his eyes. If he does he probably won't freak out for a kiss. <br>  <br>  Viola you are out of the friend-zone. If you can't hand hold then you have no chance of getting out of the friend-zone without just straight out telling him what you want.
ipRPrvzxaa	Yes, kiss him randomly when he's least expecting it
dzPgBdrcaa	Yeah that's absolutely a great idea. There's no better way to lose your virginity than with a professional. She can probably show you all the ropes and stuff. If you pay her enough, she can probably literally show you some ropes.|`|s5y6SZhnaa	what in gods name is wrong with you????? there is no problem being a virgin until you are out of college. psh. you are fifteen. oh my god! slap yourself on the face and say 'i will not get a girl pregnant!' <br>  then go buy some condoms and hope for the best.<br>  and don't have sex with a girl just because you want to be like other guys, it will crush her to a bloody heap.|`|uVi9tpBxaa	whores give you Aids because the did other guys or girls<br>  Wait till marriage|`|q333ldEdaa	Its a great thing! I would like a guy more if I knew he was never with another girl before and I was his first. I would also want a guy to wait until marriage because you should have sex with some one you love. Its even feels better when you are making love to someone you love. It's always the best.|`|HVJCkuzfaa	Wow. Dont get a ho. Get a girlfriend... Commit to her and when you both are ready, get protection and go for it. <br>  <br>  Until then..<br>  <br>  Try masterbaiting. :D<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KDW2tANfaa	Don't pay a whore. Try masturbating, cyber sex and watching porn to please yourself.. If you still want sex I'm sure there's a willing girl out there|`|6ozGEPdIaa	it's not as big of a deal as your making it to be... my best guy friend is 19 and he's still a virgin. Girls will respect you more if you don't sleep around and have a bad reputation... and paying a whore is not a good idea... just wait.
4vLt3SqFaa	She has a horrified fascination with your hair|`|LDe9yzCKaa	she is using the most retarded excuse to touch you :) lol .. enjoy!|`|uVi9tpBxaa	that your head needs to be massaged|`|AcjLKC2Laa	Your question is MAKING no sense !
Lfc9Zav2aa	I would dump them both. why are you catering to them?|`|PpWosZsIaa	Keep your friend. In time, your friend will apologize for her actions.|`|TVEJS83Waa	That is childish of your friend to flirt with your ex...... If she was really your friend she would not do that. About your ex do you still like/love him? Depends on why you guys broke up should you make up your mind in taking him back...... talk to your friend and let her know how you feel..... if you do go back with your ex, that shouldnt be any of your friends business.|`|5mLI3sJyaa	ok maybe since you were mad at your friend you just thought that she made sure you saw...<br>  but the again maybe not...<br>  if i was in your situation id get with the guy...<br>  because if your friends ever were a true friend they would of never done that to you no matter if you guys are mad at eachother or not
he3O1RFUaa	Maybe she's really shy and is worried that she won't know what to say/do. She might not have been as shy at first because she didn't like you as much.<br>  Or maybe she found someone else?|`|DvET4w2laa	Because you say things like "organize a party" so how did you ask her to come to your party.. " will you like to enter my party"|`|I12nj0M7aa	Girls are crazy, complicated, and annoying. That's why I could never be a lesbian.|`|FxaSWn6Eaa	She's just not that into you.|`|gmH1MPn1aa	people change minds change that's life...|`|4Ug9FdFdaa	you went wrong
mYAbq6fnaa	well, it really depends on the kind of failing you are talking about or if it is failing at something in specific. for example, if your just talking about failing in general, failing at anything, then yes, if your failing at failing then you would already be failing. but say if you were i dont know, trying to not care about your grades and you wanted to fail (for some reason that i dont know), so you try to fail but you care about your grades too much so you dont make a bad grade. that would be failing at failing. hope i helped, i know thats kinda confusing.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	How about, "Once you are Failing, you have Successfully FAILED"!|`|KwNpyp3saa	Possible.  If you fail, fail big. Learn from your mistakes.
FoWDGLyIaa	Casually mention it if your very nervous. 5 years is a very long time. Let him know how you feel sometime soon! Maybe there is a social event that both of you are going to, or a party or something. Don't think too much on it, you will convince yourself not to tell him (which would be bad). Make it quick and simple. You don't have to make it like a romantic movie, try to stay in your comfort zone. Another way is to tell a friend to tell him. This way, you won't have to face him. But he might not believe it and it could possibly be annoying for him. Soon you'll loose your chance. Stay confident and quickly speak up!|`|3Rqq6WjDaa	well i think that you should just ask him out, the worst he can say is no, and its not the end of the world, but if he just says no and your embarrsed you can tell him it was a dare but if he says yes then great! then u can explain to him that you have liked him for so long. =)<br>  xoxo|`|HfBDI2DTaa	Take the opportunity when you are walking home to ask him out! This sounds like you two have feelings for each other! Go for it!|`|cNnkWLwJaa	What You Waiting for? Better tell him before it's too late. I mean 5 years is long!
S3eWfTqvaa	Ok *YOU* broke up with *HIM* so why are you bothering him ?<br>  <br>  You offended him by telling him let's be friends.... That's like adding insult to injury. If you don't want to be with him, leave him alone and let him get a girl who's really into him.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're sending mixed signals.
y6gmFgOmaa	well, firstly, you need to deal well with the fights so that it doesn't escalate to the point that she thinks of leaving you..for that, you need to be able to deal well wid conflicts..they happen to every couple..but if u get all defensive n uptight about it everytime u r fighting..then it wil get messier..the only  way to deal wid it..is to confront, be honest n frank about wat u feel n yet put it in a calm, polite tone..n dont keep things piled up until they burst someday n everything is over..<br>  <br>  about how to keep her happy..u gotta introduce some sort of novelty in ur relationship..u kno, mayb surprise her with something..preferably handmade..girls are suckers for personally made gifts..it need not be big or expensive..just something small.. do innovative stuff like that occasionally.. it wil make her feel good n she'll do the same back.. <br>  <br>  hope this helped..|`|1BaeFYnEaa	The best way my boyfriend stops a fight is shutting me up with a deep kiss and hugging me. My feet turn all rubbery :) Fights are normal, as long as there aren't really serious subjects in debate.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	Take time to sit down and see is it really worth fighting about. you could solve a lot of problems by saying yeah baby your right I'm wrong. Somethings would be avoided if you two actually sit down and talk about them clearly with no misunderstanding.|`|SrtbzI2caa	Have you tried asking her what would make her happy? Tell her you really love her. Talk to her. Communication is the key.<br>  <br>  I have the same problem. Only for a him. I tried to ask him that question and he said "I just want to be with you". That's kind of hard. Well, we are together, but our relationship has too many restrictions being the fact that I'm Asian with super strict parents! (Oh, I'm not a kid. I'm actually turning 21. LOL) So yea, we can't always see each other or go out... so we usually argue about that. (tsks tsk tsk parents) It's sad. I know he loves me, but I'm scared that he'll get tired of being patient and he'll find somebody else who can give him what he wants. So please... if you figure out a way. Share the info.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Nc9aASDlaa	"I love you with all my heart, but we fight. A lot. And it's killing me to think I might lose you."<br>  <br>  Tell her exactly that, seriously, if your not afraid to share this with strangers I'm sure you can share that with her.  She will appreciate what you think.|`|87fe23c8854ccc855c100fbb074d92f1aa	Tell her you love her and care about her and basically everything you stated in the description. I'm sure, if she loves you, she'll understand and respond accordingly.|`|xUKSGsx8aa	just say wat comes from ur heart
R0U4qy6haa	another notch in my belt|`|cdSYbMzkaa	i think sweet freshmeat|`|gYzbuq9haa	i think it's cool i'm still a virgin and when a girl tells me they i think it ok its your body you do what you want.
zzaScg0haa	Why not ask her about something you are working on in class?
eACNDL17aa	ah! i had the same problem, But i think he is trying to get your attention, he wants you to notice him. he's probably shy and doesn't want to ask you out first or anything because hes affraid of rejection, i say just talk to him! be confident! :)|`|aWbxrMCRaa	He seems to be trying to get closer to you. (That's good!!)  But maybe you should try talking to him.|`|XxqUBcozaa	i think its possible for him to like you but why wait for him to make the first move<br>  be different from all the other girls, say to him how uve noticed these things and that you like him. most guys love confidence in a girl<br>  give him time to think about it and then if he hasnt said anything about it just ask him his thoughts and if it doesnt work then you'll know to move on<br>  <br>  hope that helps
38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	First off, after three years you should break up with her in person. Don't do it over text message, instant message, facebook, telephone, etc. <br>  <br>  Explain your reasoning in a slightly nicer way than you did here. Possibly: "It's been three years and we've both changed a lot and we're not really right for each other any more. I'd like to still be friends with you, if that's possible." <br>  <br>  Don't get mad at her. Say it in as calm of a tone as you can.<br>  <br>  If she tries to pose a fight (which she probably will) ignore her and walk away. Fighting with her will not help you remain friends.<br>  <br>  Only say that you want to be friends if you really do want to be friends and you sound like you do so don't worry about this.<br>  <br>  Choose the proper time. Make sure you're alone. Make sure there's nothing that can interrupt you. Make sure that you both have a scape route so you can both get away from where ever you are immediately. Like, don't invite her over if she's going to have to call for a ride after you break up. Pay for everything that you do prior to breaking up. How horrible would it be if you went on a nice date and you paid for everything only to have the other person break up with you?<br>  <br>  Be nice. Don't say anything that you wouldn't say to her when you actually were dating.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I wish you well.|`|ntGOF9Wmaa	you guys lasted for 3 YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL! good job|`|IEZr9yjhaa	The best thing to do is to be honest. Let her know there isn't someone else. That you want to be single. I have to tell you that after dating for 3 years it is going to be rough for her to understand the friendship part. I think you should be honest and make a clean break. Maybe you can be friends after a year or so. Or if she gets herself another boyfriend.|`|SrtbzI2caa	Just tell her exactly how you feel. There's nothing wrong about changing your feelings for anyone. Tell her you still want to be friends. Be honest about it. If you still want a shot at being friends, the best you can do is just tell her how you feel. Do not make her wait and expect that every thing is fine when it's not. If it's over, it's over. She'll cry about it. It'll hurt. She'll probably hate you and not talk to you for some time, but if you care about her, set her free. Do not be selfish. She deserves to be with someone who really loves her and wants to be with her just as much as you deserve to be with someone else you actually love.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.
Lfc9Zav2aa	get a kinda fat girl|`|EccdNc8maa	Be yourself,Have confidence.I'm kinda fat too but that does not make me different from other people.Remember you cannot be judge physically even if some thinks your not that good looking or what,its always the inner beauty that counts.|`|8t6zDfzqaa	How big are you? Go on a strict diet and have someone help you on it! Some girls like guys for their mind and not their body. I know I'm very unattracted to guys who are a complete asshole to me and think they own the fuckin word, wonder why so many people degrade him. Be sweet, nice to her but if she's a ***** then screw her, find someone that will respect you. Remember! You come first before anyone else, you have to start to do things to boost up your self confidence, then you'll feel alot more happy about yourself, you'll be able to love others as well! Let go of resentment and ego an your free!!!|`|AN95iBe0aa	If you like yourself then others will like you. if you let your true self shine through from the inside out then you will find that appearance becomes a smaller and smaller issue.|`|ciahKXTDaa	Everything Angie C. said, except don't let your ego fly away with you.  No one likes a narsicist.|`|bvZpJk3Kaa	Report yourself.|`|e2i7KRnUaa	Once you're cool with you, a girl will be cool with you.
5j1Uhg2Gaa	Its normal. If you don't have a girlfriend than you hormones start to act up and what and so your hormones send a signal to your brain because you/your body is trying to find is a girl to be with so of course you will be interested/attracted to many at once. Women do it too. Its hard to explain. If you pick up a psychology book you will understand. lol.|`|BV7ZRKpUaa	if you like them and kind of keep it to yourself then your not a player haha...if you flirt with them your also not...but if you kiss all of them then yes deffinately player..i like 5 guys right now but im not kissing them or anything|`|Np1MpB4maa	Very Normal!
AA10327793	Here is one girl-boy talking scenario:<br>  The class is over, and everybody is on the hall. A boy walks up to a girl who is packing something in her bag. He says: "I knew that heaven is on Earth, but nobody told me that heaven is also in you bra!" She stands up, and hits the guys face so hard, that he felt down immediately. She walked away, while the whole school was laughing like crazy on the boy.
AA11627920	obviously depends on the girl. cant generalize everything.|`|AA10928214	glasses are lame, some girls look cute with them though.|`|ulUBv22eaa	depends on the girl|`|3MmVWDT3aa	I don't know why but everyone seemed to like my glasses before I got contacts. They said I looked smart. But I like me without glasses! <br>  (I had nice nice glasses (not dorky))|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	With glasses!  Definitely with glasses.  But I guess only if you like intelligent girls with poor eyesight.
k4vciZryaa	It depends on your current relationship with her<br>  If you're currently friends with her and don't want to ruin that with this friendship then brush it off like it wasn't a big deal, but don't walk away.<br>  Continue on with the conversation and change the topic or something<br>  last thing you wanna do is make it awkward between you two|`|WENGBNXhaa	it shows that he's mature enough to know not everyone will say yes and he doesn't let it get him down<br>  <br>  i've noticed alot of us girls usually feel sad when we reject someone. but it makes it worse when some pity-date|`|sZMa0s7Baa	No, I would just think that he was confident and was alright with me saying no. It would make me happy because I hate when I reject guys and they get all sad or get all awkward... but I also might think that he might be covering up being sad and is gonna go sulk after he leaves. Because honestly, nobody likes getting rejected!|`|ww3ukbdVaa	no, it wouldn't really have mattered to her if she said no, unless she liked him. then she would probably feel a little pain|`|dSuihNtqaa	if its a random dude, then he is just asking girls out to get a date or whatever.... not worth thinking about.<br>  <br>  if it is a friend of yours then he might be trying to hide his hurt.|`|btFSgJmlaa	It could be that, or it could show that the guy's used to rejection, or hell, it might say that the guy's able to roll with the punches.|`|HRQjffv8aa	Okay..so if that happened to me..er well it kindah already did by anyway.. ill think..<br>  <br>  "Okay..so he's acting tough?? or maybe he isnt that interested"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  "Maybe he's used to it.."
KTqdwG3Xaa	The first answerer is exactly right.<br>  <br>  Do not give him these hints if you do not like him the way he think you do.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	He probably doesn't tell you because you both are broken up and he probably has no clue if you still feel the same way.<br>  <br>  He def has feelings for you still.  You dumped him.  Meaning, he had no intention of not being with you so of course he still cares.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	Becuase your the person whos giving him signs that you like him....dont flirt or talk to him..
kZPGTMA5aa	tell her in person, then you wont have to worry about her showing it to her friends. and its way better than telling her through email. if a relationship were to start from and email, it would only live on through email. have some guts and ask her to hangout! invite her and some friends to the movies, or just her. drop a few more hints before dropping the big "i like you" bomb. and give her some time and space, dont think shes ignoring you, shes probably thinking about you. dont bug her about it, thats the last thing to help you!<br>  good luck :)|`|ybYmQqRcaa	well if she's been ignoring your messages, it doesn't sound like she really likes you):  you can try to message her and ask her if she wants to hang out or something, just the two of you guys so you can try to figure out if she really likes you or not.|`|wsw565Ivaa	I think you should tell her how you feel in person. Its more sincere. Dont rush into it if your not ready, because she might not be either so take your time.|`|igIp9IkUaa	maybe she's just going through some stuff right now. u should  go up to her and ask her wats up .|`|BGCiqQFgaa	Ok, well if she isn't responding to your messages, she might not be interested and you could be getting a little too clingy. I'm sorry about that. If she doesn't want to talk to you, she doesn't like you and she wants you to back off. If she talks to you, then you could tell her you like her more than a friend. Don't be pushy though.
zY8uu241aa	About their own hair, or their girlfriend's hair?  I care a *little* about my hair, but just enough that I don't look like an idiot.

KXCZzFpzaa	Trust me on what I'm about to say, I lost everything because I didn't listen: Do. Not. Lie. Be honest. Be open. If he doesn't care about popularity, then there should be no problem. If he does care, he's not who you should be with. Besides, once you get out of high school you tend to forget what "popularity" was, it doesn't matter whatsoever after you leave (I'm a college junior, I can still clearly remember my moment of realization where I saw how pointless it was to try to be cool in high school). <br>  <br>  If he has true feelings for you, he won't care. He'll see you for who you are, not how popular you are.
j5o5qYmpaa	Kissed you?
RHRReSLNaa	thats what guys do check out women 24/7 but he's not showing you much respect by saying it to you all the time let him know it bothers <br>   you if he dosen't stop it then he really must not care about your feeling  maybe you need to take a better look at the guy|`|B8UYpXi2aa	if he tells u ur beautiful than is not a jerk !|`|LSRBgBlraa	I use to that. I don't make it to make my girlfriend jealous and yes my girlfriend has told me that is kinda of annoying if you say it to much! In my personal situation a tell my girlfriend that another girls is hot just if i want her to see the "hot lady" because i want her to copy something of her style like a pedicure, or pants, or hair style, or shoes,etc. That's why i do it. <br>  <br>  It's like saying, look at her pedicure its so hot i'll die if you use it like that! I don't know if you get the point but thats an example.|`|E84iCYH2aa	Well basically guyz love talking straight and they dont see something wrong in calling hot girl hot even if its in front of their gfs. Because they cant afford to think in a very complex manner as girls or women do. They are biologically made like that ;)<br>  <br>  But ya i dont rule out the possibility of making you feel jealous sometimes. Or may be sometimes he tries to convey the message to you that you should also put in a little effort to look hot.<br>  <br>  Chill girl, therez nothing to fret about. This is absolutely normal with guyz|`|7Y0a2G6Vaa	Guys don't do that, TOOLS do. That's totally lame, he's probably just trying to be an ***, and he doesn't deserve you. Why don't you ask him why he says that and tell him it bothers you. Tell him you're done... or you should start pointing out hot guys to him and see how he likes it. Don't put up with that, you're going to need to leave him as soon as possible. It's ok, dating is trial and error, don't get too attached until you get past this kind of stupid thing. I'm sorry this happened to you, don't let it get you down! I would even smack him if I were you!<br>  <br>  Good luck with that, take care!|`|dDzeqKCwaa	I am a girl. But i think they do that because thats just them. They probably want to make you jelaous. Just tlak to him about it. But also know, that he is yours. If he says stuff to make you think that he doesnt love or like you anymore then really confront him|`|hu27r07Caa	I do it sometimes too...<br>  I don't even think about it, which I think shows a sign of comfort and trust to the girlfriend. More of a casual than the initial up-tight relationship thing...<br>  <br>  Or he's just trying bug you...|`|D8ukWu82aa	yeah one boy i dated did that. its so rude. the next boy i dated treated me so much better so yeah i think you can be treated better|`|IZq0IQxQaa	that is just disrespectful. don't put up with it please, you can do better|`|gkVd0encaa	i do it but my gf just does it back.... do the same as my gf.... it doesent work on me but maybe it will piss your bf off....|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	To scare you and see how you react like if your jealous or not.|`|PtDQ46Tjaa	He wants you to break up with him<br>  <br>  You should do it|`|j8JgSRTnaa	i do it yeah its to make them jealous|`|SOxzD2Waaa	he just wants to mess with you.|`|Sdy2G97daa	you are hot...|`|6t1CClfQaa	hes a jack ***.... but u should jsut break up wiut him if u dont like it|`|BM7IBXtxaa	I do not...because...well, she was on playboy for twice...|`|w2LYWMZBaa	Being his girlfriend does not make you the only hot girl in town.

He came to visit the town I live in "on a whim" and needed a place to stay.  Wound up being my house and he never left.  Shortly after that we started dating.  We have been together 5 years now, married for 4, and have 2 wonderful kids together.  We couldn't be happier.|`|5hz1DlqWaa	it all depends on you.<br>  if you think its to fast.<br>  slow it down a little.<br>  talk with your gf.

That might have been his indirect way of wanting to ask you out?<br>  <br>  He already agreed with you that he wanted to be more than friends.So maybe you should joke around and ask him when he wants to have a relationship.
nmQZIYutaa	You scared him away and you didn't let him be himself. he may really like you but you came on way to strong and tried to change him. Let him be his self and go apologize for making him feel awkward and that you would like to give it another try. Accept him for him quirks and all.
AA10829482	Somebody, usually the guy, says something like, I'm not seeing anyone else , are you.  Or words to that effect.  Hopefully, the answer is no, because then the guy says, how about we keep that way.  Or words to that effect.  If she says yes, then you have to consider your options.|`|pOLBKKNpaa	you're always the last to know . . .|`|1mL4Lxtnaa	It seems pretty solid. 4 nights a week, 2 months, mutual friends... it looks good. Just find the right moment or the right time to ask if it's too soon to want to be committed or exclusive. Or just ask if she's willing to be in a 'relationship' at this point. All can be done without making it too serious to the point of pressure, but well enough to be considered on a non-joking note. <br>  <br>  Go for it when the time feels right. :]|`|qiHNnZh7aa	since you are very close and both of you like each other company than i think you should ask her views about it<br>  tell her that you won't change whatever her decision may turn out and you will always be for her<br>  talk -Good luck|`|AA11315360	Yes you need to establish it by talking to her. Tell her "I dont want to see anyone else but you now. I am looking for a serious relationship. How do you feel about that?"<br>  If you do not say anything then she can still date other men.|`|8DMEn24faa	just ask her. trust me. it worked for me this year in a really tricky situation and i dont regret it at all.<br>  people tend to regret things they dont do more than things they do.|`|QNG0zkQRaa	Considering you guys have been dating for 2 months, I think that you both have had enough time to feel each other out and should both have a good sense if this is someone you would date on a more serious level. Seems to me that she obviously thinks your a nice guy and she must be attracted to you. I think it's a good idea to bring it up to her. I'm a girl and personally would rather the guy bring up the topic of a committed relationships. If shes not ready then no biggie, at least you know where shes at and she'll know where your at. Its so much easier being in any relationship when both people are on the same page. Good luck, I hope everything works out for you!|`|F3Btkl0Raa	Well if you like her and want to be in a committed relationship then talk to her. The worst thing you could do is wait. Just talk to her about it because it will be better for you both in the long run. Good luck.
FZKFLTyLaa	Yea. He shows clear signs that he likes you.
BbcBTIrUaa	I thought I already had answered this!!!<br>  I said NO!<br>  you are AWESOME!!!<br>  I LOVE YOU!!!<br>  <br>  I am feminine too and alot of people think I am gay<br>  but I really really love girls!!!  Like ALOT!!! Like<br>  I think girls are soooooooo AWESOME!!<br>  <br>  I dont know why people think that just because a girl<br>  acts "manly" it means they are lesbians.<br>  <br>  I say, be yourself and dont worry what others expect you<br>  to be.  As for, is it a turn off? HECK NO!!<br>  I love to check out muscular girls that dont wear make-up<br>  and dont shave and stuff, but what is even HOTTER is their down and dirty character.  whoa baby!! take me with you!!!<br>  <br>  but people will tend to think that you are not into boys,<br>  so if you are interested in boys,<br>  I would suggest making it obvious or clear somehow!!
uBGCvoktaa	no no, i totally dont believe that. many people that are dating currently either feel left out if otherwise,lonely. people that are able to walk alone right now, in this world of couples, i admire. I find them very strong and independent people. many of the single people ARE the strong people, so no.
F0YIbT1eaa	Personally I like #1 - the kissing part.  My question is which body parts would he actually be kissing?  Could make a difference between Prince Charming and Prince not-so-charmng. I do return favors BTW.  Just a little something for you to think about!  Hmmmm?|`|nlQyTrLhaa	If I to choose between the 3, probably the first. I mean something so special to make me awake from my coma, then it's really beyond special.|`|ADtOICOvaa	Me masturbating.|`|4CmiMaclaa	1|`|p3Er94Smaa	I would say.. when i push him down the stairs and he brought me down with him... so we rolled down the stairs... then he landed on top of me and began to kiss me passionately and i returned the gesture frenching him and wanting him more and more. This was an amazing moment.<br>  <br>  I'd take the first statement and then we can play erotic bondage ;)|`|m2eHPeciaa	none of the above. sex with candles on is hotter.|`|8QFj3ADfaa	none i just want a man that isnt a ****** loser!|`|Qcr0VzvMaa	1! its really sweet lol but u never know....she might not wake up!!!!! haha

It's ok,I think you should find some1 ur age for now,but like when ur in ur 20's then you can go for younger guys,because these days soooo many married couples are like more than 5 years apart! My sis is 4 years older then her fiance,and my mom is 8 years older than my dad. And I'v liked TUNS of younger guys then me,like last year I was 13,and I liked a 10 year old.* he was EXTREMELY handsome* So yeah...|`|Zdq3ZASZaa	There is nothing wrong with dating a younger boy as long as you know your limitations and he knows his.  If you really like him than date him tell him how you feel and if he feels the same way than that can be good for you .  I've dated guys  younger than me and there is nothing wrong with it as long as you know limitations <br>  <br>  Good Luck Hope this helps!|`|lHK13vqwaa	its not too bad, but just be careful, young guys are usual less mature, even though you don't realize it.<br>  take it slow, it is more than possible that it can work out.|`|wfKtKlktaa	3 years is enough for the whole statutory rape thing you should really be carefula bout it but you guys seem like you click cause age doesnt even amtter when youre older anyway right|`|doEzXSquaa	u just got a case of well how could u say u just like him cause he is sheltered and hasnt entered high school so he is still pretty wholesome;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ps.

faeXRQmcaa	OK, <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is insecure and jealous of Mark. Try to explain to him he is the one you like/love not Mark! Tell him that you have been talking to him lately because of the double date idea.. Communication is very important! Also, when he cools down, let him no he treated you badly and should give you an apology. Make a mutual promise that before either of you blow up like that, you will have the confidence to tell each other what you are feeling.<br>  <br>  Answer mine: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtaPN1UC10cA64QC3Vvieqrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304180327AA1zgcH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|xxyaYG0caa	hey im in 8th grade too! my friend just broke up with a boyfriend that was all jealous like urs and he always said go hook up with so and so and blah blah. trus me he is sooo not worth it. if he doesnt trust u enough and isnt ok w/ u hanging w/ other guys dump him and move on it may seem hard but ull get over him eventually|`|sp7yqqKNaa	eighth grade?<br>  my god, whats happening with the world, 12 year olds acting like theyre in thier late teens... sad really.. <br>  <br>  its ok when you get to high school your "boyfriend" will be even more jealous|`|8th9KY1haa	Have you consider discusing this with your parents?|`|348c1f8197faba0bac2ad5414e72d114aa	say you either trust me or you dont....or walk away|`|9CmzS0dsaa	This is a lot of DRAMA for someone who is in the eight grade.... but i think that u need to talk to ur boyfriend and tell him why u've been hanging out with ur ex boyfriend/friend. How do u expect him not to feel the way he is feeling "jealous"... He probably thinks that ur gonna leave him for ur ex and that maybe you were using him as a rebound, he rather break up and let u go now, then to like u more and then for him to get hurt in the long run.I think that if u have a talk with him and let him Know he's the only one. and if u too really like each other than things will work out, because trust, honesty and respect is the key to a god relationship. If he still doesn't want to be with u after this.. than i say u move on and slow down a bit, worry about graduating from 8th grade and looking forward to High School, there are plenty of guys that u will meet. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Uhh I'd be pretty pissed off if my boyfriend was hanging with his ex all of the time. Oh and you're in 8th grade...so the odds of you loving eachother in the first place are sort of slim.|`|Kc7dbcB7aa	I think you should come righ out and tell your boyfriend wats up<br>  nd if he doesnt believe you<br>  then have mark explain the same thing<br>  you might have to ruin the surprise <br>  but if you wanna save your realationship<br>  thats wat you have to do<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out
41S75G5Eaa	it think shes definitely interested in you<br>  when i like someone i pay attention to every little word they say|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Maybe she's just friendly? I ask for people numbers, call them, text them, and I'm MARRIED. It doesn't mean I'm trying to get laid. <br>  <br>  If you like this girl, ask her out.
CsjhdpJSaa	.
C5Ftdtl0aa	lame!  just ask her out the worst that could happen is she says no.|`|hAB7m8otaa	just go up to her... going up to her friend is lame because her friend will tell her about it before you talk to her|`|dCmSA6r2aa	go for it but you should ask her|`|TwmkoS7Gaa	DUDE!!!!!! UUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHH I hate it when guys do this I'm a guy OK me and my girlfriend were friends for about 4 1/2 months and then I decided to ask her out we've been going strong for about 1 year now.<br>  <br>  so my advice is don't ask her best friend to ask her out for you........grow a pair walk up to her start a conversation and ask her out yourself|`|PjFLDSmdaa	I mean it's not the worst thing in the world, but I'd suggest asking her yourself.|`|qq84piBLaa	why don't you just ask the girl yourself...|`|BGCiqQFgaa	I'm sorry to say this, but bad plan. I think that she would rather you get up the courage to ask her to her face. If your too nervous to try and ask her out, how does she know you aren't going to chicken out of a relationship? Talk to her alone, and say, hey! I think I like you more than a friend. Do you want to try this. Relax, the worst thing she can do is say no!|`|YOFrOqiDaa	idk if you want my idea, but i always thought this would be cute... okay so get a white hanes t-shirt or whatever, and on the front write 'will you go out with me?' and then on the back write about 10 names of guys she associates with... write your name in sharpie, and the rest in a washable marker.. then at the bottem write '(wash me)' and when she washes it.... there ya go... <br>  idk... i just think thats cute... :)|`|2Wo9T3ZLaa	No.<br>  Don't have your friend find out.<br>  You find out, walk up to her and ask her.<br>  I never say yes to a guy if he doesn't have the guts to walk over and ask me.<br>  It's awkward when someone else asks, really awkward.. o.o ... Don't do it ..|`|qA4OxDJvaa	im sorry, but NO.<br>  never get a third person involved if u dont have to.<br>  if my best friend told me that some guy liked me, i'd think he was a loser and a wussy for not telling me himself.<br>  just be brave and find out for urself.<br>  ask HER not her friend...|`|JeUZKSQ3aa	do it to her face. if you ask a friend she'll hear it anyways so just get it done|`|ISMColXfaa	DON'T DO THE FRIEND THING.<br>  IT's sooo annoying.<br>  Be a dude and go up to her.|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	yea, it seems like the best way to get a for sure answer.
NUWdgQuraa	It's not too early, and if you're pretty sure she would say yes, JUST ASK!  We guys rarely get that warm fuzzy in the dating world, so don't waste time.  She's probably wondering, or will start to wonder, why it's taking you so long to ask her.<br>  <br>  The only advice I have as to how to do it is to ask her one-on-one.  It's not as awkward when there aren't witnesses.
JeUZKSQ3aa	Tell her how you feel because chances are she doesn't realize she's bothering you at all.|`|AA10928214	maybe she is embarrassed of you. that's how i was with one of my exes lol|`|pi3UAJgKaa	ya you should tell her, i could see how annoying this is, that would piss me off haha<br>  i think she might just be a ******, im sorry to say but if she really liked you then she would be all over you all the time.. find someone better who loves to spend time with you and loves all the attention you give to her and will stand anywere anytime and make out with you xD

gg8f1AuTaa	Seems like this guy has u head over heels huh<br>  <br>  It seems that you do like him, to care to ask a question about him already says alot.<br>  Not to mention ALL the times you've asked about him, so im gonna say that you do like him as more than a friend<br>  <br>  Go expierement , maybe u dont know ur likeness" for him yet.

Or they could be trying to make the other person jealous when they actually still love/like their ex.  Half the time they don't even know why they are going out with someone else because they are still in love with their ex.|`|AA10500703	Yes of course, anybody can decide to do anything. The world is a big place and everybody is different. Stop being so naive.|`|1jgiKEE3aa	some guys do that but they are assholes i find it really disrespectful... but other guys are better than that|`|YrbRQi6Laa	Unfortunately yes they do and you know what that's unfair to the girl he is already dating so i feel sorry for your friend.

r6L6uNMuaa	dont start a rumor!!<br>  if you do youll just continue the whole thing but if you ignore it its gonna get better! you can just tell her straight up "dont be talking about me" and if you do it in front of everybody shell get anoyed shell probably reply you in a bad manner but dont pay attention!! I know this seems very big at the moment but later in life youll be like wow i was much more intelligent than that!!<br>  youll see!!<br>  and if she calls you fat just tell her thats her opinion and you dont really care about her opinion you only care about what your loved ones think and shes not one of them!!<br>  and always say something like i hope GOd will help you with this problem that you have.. that always gets people like wow youll be much more important than her!!<br>  I hope this helps!!|`|mNZCMuSpaa	So here's what you do...<br>  you go find your mom, right?<br>  And then you say "Mom, I realized that I've turned into a complete jerk! Can you teach me some manners and how to respect other people??"<br>  <br>  I think things will turn out just fine.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Ignore her. Grow up and don't stoop to her level. I'm sure you are not fat but you will be stupid if you play her game.|`|fX1q4SnTaa	just don't|`|IyfspYM8aa	How bout NONE!  Grow up.  By the way, have you ever been to Hollister?  It's a ghetto 20 miles inland and I feel that everyone who wears it is wearing a mask for society.  Obviously, I'm right.  There is no need for rumors.  You don't like them, she won't like them and it will only get worse.  Stop worrying about boys.  Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with any of the losers who go to your school?  I hope not.  Who cares if you're fat or not?  She's probably anorexic or bulimic and is skinnier than Angelina Jolie.  That is gross.  She will end up in a trailer park with a loser guy she dated in high school, probably in Hollister.|`|RgymoiIQaa	Living well is the best revenge. Although, in school rumors can be crucial. I would write something on the bathroom wall about her like she likes to suck d***. But be careful that the people you tell don't run and snitch on you. You could write a note faking to be her and leave it somewhere for someone to find putting all of her deepest darkest secrets out there. Tell people she had crabs. Tell people she stinks. tell people she doesn't shave. Hahahahahahaha, I love this!!|`|piuEx0BJaa	dude dont spread rumors just get over it you sound like an immature brat|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	nothing...ignore it, high school dosnt last that long. assuming your in hs because of the question...|`|KKhc5UiYaa	oooh what rumor should i start what are you 10?

You can't fight fire with fire. I'm sure that's just what she wants you to do. If you pretend that you don't care it will go away.

Don't even think about that stuff man, use your energy for more productive things. Besides, when you do get involved it'll just drag you down. Keep your higher ground!

When she says something mean about you to your face, just sarcastically dismiss what she's saying as insignificant, then just ignore anything else that is said from then onward. Carry on with making the best of your day so you can be happy. Don't resort to making someone else unhappy. Make yourself and those around you happy, either by joking or whatever. Don't put people down. If you resort to rumor spreading, then you really are the stupid one. Don't sink down to that crappy level.

Starting a rumor about this girl wont do any good.<br>  Just act like you don't care she'll get bored eventually.

d9I98cgaaa	It's beautiful! i don't see why she wouldnt! my advice... its sooo good! try adding some more stuff about her beauty...but dont over do it... i think its good enough though. <br>  YOU GET A GOLD STAR!! :)|`|5VpboyKgaa	love it all, if she really likes you you wont even sound stupid, my man  now husband drew the weridest picture of me and gave me a rose with a poem and all I can do is feeeeeeeeeeeeelllll special:) awesome and very sweet of you|`|TPRQDf5waa	i think that she'll love it|`|ckkUd0Uuaa	omg...|`|ISMColXfaa	Gosh, she's luckie to have you :D
y9TvRvs6aa	Well yeah, me and my ex set up a couple of our friends... and they are getting married later in the year.<br>  <br>  Give it a shot, see what happens.|`|QnWtSRWsaa	no i just do it myself by asking out peole after getting to know the girl better|`|L1Ys2tKgaa	I have and they usually turn out to be more of the friend type of person. But it's worth a shot. Good luck.|`|NtFC5sn4aa	THATS ALL I DO! omg it works great! <br>  <br>  good luck
S3uLASLnaa	I say that your boyfriend isn't a very good one. Good boyfriends understand your point of view and don't expect expensive gifts after a silly fight.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	Sounds to me like your boyfriend has got some serious problems anyway and he's only using you... so forget him there are plenty of nice guys out there.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	He really sounds like a piece of sh*t you should drop him like a sack of potatos and find some guy that wont make you buy him stuff because he's mad if you dont get out now it will only worsen later on|`|Ogducl0vaa	sounds like he is the not right one for you.  Leave him alone and think of it this way.  There are other fish in the sea to catch.|`|go4R8pN3aa	Your  "boyfriend" is using you. Dump him.|`|6MSmvWubaa	no offence but your bf is a jerk. dont give him b*** s*** he is using you|`|An2GISZYaa	leave him , he obviously a jerk. and him telling you to buy him an expensive gift is a selfish thing to do. he obviously isnt the one for you|`|wdYJqrnHaa	dump him any guy who can't accept his girl making a mistake is trash. plus taking advantage of you like that is just plain wrong!|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	This is called emotional abuse. He makes a mistake and you are supposed to forgive him and if not owell doesn't bother him but you make a honest mistake and you should have to pay for it and he won't let it go therefore you feel bad. Emotional abuse RUN the other direction. Everyone makes mistakes in my opinion the only mistake you are making is letting someone lower your self esteem by calling you names. I don't even know you but you deserve better. I might not know you but I do care because so many girls/ women today are having their good self esteem stompt out of them by not physical but emotion abuse. It never gets better only worse.Do yourself a favor and find someone who will treat you good and forgive and forget when you make a silly mistake.|`|WPfLTRJmaa	uhhhhh..........i dont know about your man but when i was mad at my former gf all id ask her to do was tickle me and tell me why i am special to her :S.........ur man seems to me manipulating you for expensive things which is completely wrong for him to do. <br>  <br>  Anyway if you keep on telling him your sorry and that it won't happen again he should believe you but if he keeps making you buy expensive stuff I'd seriously recommend confronting him about this because it doesn't sounds right.
aY1djwb5aa	If you don't understand love, then you don't know what love is. I suggest you stop saying you "love" someone, unless it is your parents, etc. This will help you out in the long run, honestly. Love, carries so much extra things with it. It carries respect, trust, loyalty, honesty, etc. If you don't say you "love" someone, none of that come with you, and that is a big monkey off your back. If you like him, date him again. Tell him you LIKE HIM. That is it...then when/if he dumps you again, you can tell yourself, I only "liked" him. Granted the breakup will be just as painful, you will know you don't really "love" him.<br>  <br>  Point is, you will know when you love someone. And when you do, you will be a lot older than you are no. You are to young to experience "love". I know you've heard that a million times, but it is the truth. I went though the same thing. Where I thought I knew love...it took me over 3 years to figure out I was just lieing to myself.|`|HHuS48u5aa	need to get a life and move on.|`|gD7MWKMtaa	You can't let go of your memories/past with him.|`|vLbOh36Haa	If you hated him, I'm sure there is a good reason.  Stick with it!  You are wasting your time with him.  Don't give him the satisfaction.  Stick to your guns and try to realize that any kind of relationhip that goes in circles will only drive you crazy and yea, it will bring you up but you can't forget that it will also bring you down.  Don't waste anymore time.  You deserve way better and you know it! Stay strong xoxo The sooner you realize, the better off you'll be.  Cut off all contact you will thank yourself when even a month goes by you'll feel stronger about it.
jmlAmr3gaa	What?  That's REALLY unlikely to work, unless you've been dating her for ages.<br>  <br>  Try making her smile first.|`|AcARmgG1aa	youll need more than one text budd..|`|08y217Rdaa	Yea, like if you saw her yesterday for the first time, you obviously don't know what would make her wet. If you know her, you know what to say.|`|PtyXfg5Aaa	You wanna dance?... horizontally that is<br>  <br>  psssst... i know where your Gspot is!<br>  <br>  Sex? no?! then how about a peepee touch<br>  <br>  Do you have any American in you? no?! do you want some? <br>  <br>  Apart from being sexy, what do you do for a living?<br>  <br>  Can i have directions?

6J8sHGRIaa	Don't worry! It's just acne (not a disease) lol. :) Be confident and don't let acne make you lower your confidence! You can use medicine at drug stores (like "Terminator10" or "Clean & Clear Advantage [Acne Spot Treatment]").<br>  Next time you're with him and your friends, keep you head up and posture straight to show confidence. When you talk to him, (as for everyone) look at him in the eyes and smile. This might also give him a hint. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't forget... Confidence is the key! :D|`|jXe4RVvLaa	theres no point in hiding it,<br>  everyones got it<br>  <br>  and he's your crush.. if you ever want it to be more then just that<br>  he's gunna see your face eventually<br>  how are you gunna look at the ground or cover your face with your sweater if he's kissing you?<br>  ain't gunna happen<br>  <br>  be happy with what you got :) flaunt it|`|CFPSVMJIaa	it can be annoying but u either have to just get makeup to cover it up, really any make up or even foundation would work or just be more confidient and most ppl won't care at all, really its still urself and u should be urself no matter what u look like, i mean act how u do around ur friends, who lets say have acne too, so theres nothing to be embarrassed bout|`|0v1rmqcTaa	maybe wash ur face? i donno thats just what I do...|`|s4TMc1vqaa	dont feel so insecure! Smile and he will be too busy looking at your smile and eyes and stuff than your acne. i have some too...but i cover it up with makeup, liquid fondation works pretty good too!|`|0yh3bcjpaa	clean and clear advantage acne spot treatment will reduce or get rid of the acne with in 3 days! it works trust!<br>  then u need to hold you head up high and flaunt your stuff, with confidence, that will get him to notice you.<br>  <br>  get it at your local drug store, or super market!!!
3c2d62279c0725273058507451c39522aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  You probably do very much love your boyfriend. I believe that. But if he was truely "the one" you wouldn't fall for another guy. Your love for him isn't "soulmate" love it is just love. <br>  <br>  But on another note, sex does complicate things as much as some like to argue that it doesn't. Having sex with someone makes you more attached to them than you may normally be; especially if you have sex with them frequently. <br>  <br>  If you have deep feelings for another guy, I don't think it is fair to you or your boyfriend to stay in the relationship.<br>  If you two breakup and come back together then you are mean't to be otherwise you can see how things go with this other guy.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	I can't believe he's willing to share you sexually. forget emotionally|`|1T1rI8Vvaa	i think that u & your boyfirnd had made the decision of havin a open relationship so both of you knew what each other was gettin into.BUT the choice is up to u.do u really love your boyfriend better than the guy u have feelings for??Love is an emotion than is stronger than anything.It can make you happy or it can make you sad.Also if you can't see him often since you move then u really shouldn't want a long distance relationship.<br>  Take care & i wish u the best in what your decision is GOOD LUCK|`|HZESgWC1aa	Your boyfriend only agreed to the OPEN RELATIONSHIP because he couldn't face the idea of you leaving him which is so pathetic....Any man that loves you or wants  you would not want to share your body with another man...Anyways in your case, I think you should break up with him or lose complete contact with the second guy...However if you have already let someone new into your relationship doesn't mean you won't let another person so do your guy a favor and call it quits. He will hurt but think about how much you will hurt him by staying and cheating on him.|`|6IbjUH01aa	You guys both took the chance of this, even though it was physical emotions can spark too. <br>  <br>  You shoudlnt ask ne one else whats the right thing to do. what do you t hink you should do??? Do u think you take a break from your bf and have some time to yourself, think who would make YOU more happy.
BbcBTIrUaa	well if you added him it must for a reason right?<br>  sooooo ask him whatever you want to know about him,<br>  "say I noticed this about you what does it do?"<br>  or<br>  "do you mind meeting random people like me?"|`|T58Ood6yaa	just be kool about it...like .."how goes it?" or "wats good?"..you know..kinda be fly about it lol
hvIMKEH0aa	don't worry about hooking up.<br>  people always put a kiss as a game when it's not.<br>  when you kiss somebody it's supposed to be<br>  something you care for and definitely somebody you know.<br>  all those little gay parties don't do anything except<br>  show off the amount of desperate people in that room.<br>  don't rush.<br>   be as slow as you want.<br>  it's your life, not anybody else's.<br>  kiss when you want to kiss somebody, not because<br>  everybody you know already has.|`|AA11447210	You're only 15, this isn't a crisis...you shouldn't even be dating until after your next birthday (at least). Relax. Just because others do something (or claim to) doesn't mean it's a good idea or that you have to try to catch up to them.<br>  <br>  When the time is right, it will happen.|`|txquWGwRaa	go for the chance u cAn get to hook up dnt b scared to ask|`|xA2SRCT3aa	good ideaa. try going to parties more often. if you dont like someone but want to be "gettin" with girls then thats your best choice.<br>  .. i guess if your drinking it would be easier but if not its still okay.. just see whatever girls your interested in or who are showing interest.. take them to a room or something and just go in for a kiss and let the kiss evolve into making out. it should come naturally . just dont slobber on her face or shove your tongue down her throat. just enough tongue is good.|`|4a88b6f3d78184085afa47effba9cfebaa	Wait for someone you really like - a potential girlfriend,<br>  it will be better and mean more to you.|`|aRh4FKUaaa	Don't kiss a girl if it doesn't mean anything.|`|p03xBnS0aa	maybe you should just take a chance and make a move on someone.|`|K7qVTt7raa	Don't make out with some girl just to make out. You should wait to find someone you really like before you do something like that.|`|piSXMZ9qaa	Because your grandma sucks ahhhhhhhhh LOL|`|jPiJ70uOaa	Freshman year is when most people start becoming sexually active. So just becuase all your friends have, dont worry your not behind !<br>  Its not something you can really plan. But parties are a good way. Make sure your not taking advantage of a girl though. Are there any girls you talk to alot or have been flirting with or know of that like you? If so then you should just make a move, maybe even get a little drunk (not too drunk) to boost your confidence. Just make sure your getting flirty vibes back from the girl, and try not to do it in front of tons of people. <br>  It is probably best to wait for a girl you really care about tho and that likes you too. <br>  Dont feel rushed!
nC8GRKxhaa	Hi darl,<br>  <br>  You said that you went out with this guy on a date, then he dumped you - but still liked you?<br>  <br>  Sometimes this is where it can get confusing or really simple for girls - for me I would also be confused. <br>  <br>  Becasue your right, if this guy is talking to you and making an effort with you ocassionally then you think, okay well he must be interested, and the he says he doesn't like your friend and asks you if he likes you indicates some sort of interest there - Let me be honest though. <br>  <br>  This guy is just messing with you - You don't dump someone if you like them. Maybe he is interested in some one off thing with you but honestly I don't think at all that he cares about you alot or likes you alot either. He is just doing what most guys do, which is being very casual and vague. He doesn't really care too much about it all, as indicated by acions. <br>  <br>  What I think you need to do is just forget about it, ignore him, and spend time getting ot know other nicer guys. This guy is abit of a flirt by the sounds. <br>  <br>  And if he is asking you if you like him and not telling you that he likes you - maybe to encoruage you to like him or let you know. Then he is just a waste of time.<br>  <br>  A guy should stop at nothing to let you know he is into you, and cares about you. He will treat you properly. When you need to firgure him out or work out why he does something, it is never a good sign.<br>  <br>  Best wishes beautiful. x
LvGQXstraa	i would talk to him tell how you fell explain but tell you love him<br>  he will Straight up because i once had a boy just like that and we<br>  talk and he so sweet now we would still be together  if his<br>  parent would not move away today we so i hope this work for you<br>  as did for me !|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	maybe he thought u might like it bc it seemed like u liked the other picture and maybe it seemed early for you but hes not a mind reader so i dont think you should have lost respect for him|`|rEFHlhmdaa	it seems like he is trying too hard to me sexy and to get you to want him. tell him that he doesn't need to  be super sexual to be sexy he might laugh but just shrug and say "it's true" he will get it and should calm down a little. stuff like that would bother me too. it's just unnecessary. <br>  <br>  please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArdFQ4rahgIczJ2RmfRzcxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302204818AAigK2F">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.
FZKFLTyLaa	Learn a couple of really good jokes as an ice breaker and proceed from there. Jokes and laughing will put you both at ease.
1XcTZRemaa	It's totally okay! I get shy around cute guys all the time! It's natural.. Most girls get nervous, even the slightest bit. Hey, they're kind of intimidating! What if they don't like me, are they looking at me, are they thinking about me? That kind of thing. :] <br>  <br>  You just have to remember, you're not at the mall to get guy's attention - you're there to have fun! Go with friends, and mess around. Maybe walk past them with your friends and laugh and joke around. Show them how great you are! They might just take an interest.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and I hope all goes well in the future!|`|LqJrPYHGaa	just act like theyre ur friends, :D<br>  <br>  but being shy sounds really cute in a girl|`|VtvcOHZsaa	At that age of life it is normal to get shy. The best way to overcome shyness is to hand around guys more often (as friends). That way you become used to being around guys and when you come across a "cute guy" at the mall you will be less nervous.|`|u52vyE3raa	stop thinking about what you think they are thinking about you.<br>  just be yourself.|`|lyMMjVNgaa	haha clam down<br>  its normal! :)|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	its normal its A stage in life|`|4IKvranzaa	It sounds like you are getting shy because you are afraid of rejection.  Hold your head up high, smile and try not to care what they (the boys) think.  It will change your confidence level AND the boys will love it!  However, you could always concentrate on school for a few more years instead of trying to get those boys to like you.  They have cooties anyway!  Be yourself...they will come if they are worth it.|`|cxytFfvKaa	social phobia/social anxiety<br>  look it up|`|3rqd6N29aa	I was jus tlike you back when i was 13. <br>  What i did was get a target.  And walk up to them and compliment them, WHEN THEY'RE ALONE.  When dudes are with their freinds, then they seem to be assholes about everything lol. <br>  <br>  When they are alone they will be flattered and prolly start talking to you.  <br>  <br>  After the compliment if he doesnt say anything back, just walk away, show that you arent embarassed tho.  Then once you walk around the mall a few times and see him, he most likely will be looking at you.  Then you go up and talk to him, just say " hey can i hang out" or whatever "phrase" yall use now days. <br>  <br>  Ask about things you like, and see if anything yall like is common. <br>  <br>  Always worked for me, now i have not one ounce of shyness... well i didnt till i met my current love.  I was so shy, but thats cause i knew he was the one <333|`|yMD7z1LKaa	Hmm ok so i have the same problem, but this is what my friends i thought abouttt;;<br>  Just be youself. I know everyone says it, but its TRUE. It really helps. Alsooo, plan stuff to say ;D Such azzz,, whats yer fav movie? & soo on. But mostlyyy just act cutee & flirt. guys will b all overrr you, hun.

oOD3dYaNaa	Just go up to her when you see here (in, before, after class) and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. =]<br>  Then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you'll definitely have her attention and you'll have crossed her mind. And isn't that what you want? =]|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Don't say shirt.<br>  Say like hair or eyes. <br>  Shirt makes it looks like your looking at our boobs.|`|yKcZC9Dhaa	you could say i like your shirt.<br>  or just be like hey can you help me?|`|zHQVlXd5aa	Dropping a pencil only works if you are trying to look up her skirt, not start up a conversation.  Ask her if she understands something you are working on in class.  Just make it natural.  Don't sit there all day playing the words you want to say over and over in your head like I would.  It just comes out weird.<br>  <br>  To the first answer, we are looking at your boobs.|`|QENKDNKDaa	Well... if you're a guy, if you said 'I like your shirt', that would sound very feminine I guess.. first, start off a conversation by asking a math question you don't get. If she helps you out, you can strike more conversations with her later, or maybe even ask for help at lunch sometime.
0jw5j5aLaa	Why not let them meet him now?  This way, when the time comes when (or if) you get married, your family will have had plenty of time to get to know him, and hopefully, to accept him.<br>  <br>  I'd say start bringing him around often.  Let him start to become part of your family.  You say your family is becoming more open minded and are ready to give him a chance.  So you answered your own question right there.  The fear of something going wrong isn't a good enough reason to keep putting it off.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

NqirS7J1aa	There are a couple of things you could do in this situation:<br>  <br>  1. Tell her how much it bothers you what she is doing. Tell her you would really appreciatee it if she would stop, Not just in front of you, but completely. Offer Yourself to help her through her problems, Ifthat'ss not  a possibility, then find someone who can help her, maybe a professional.<br>  <br>  2. Tell Her Parents. This WILL not be the best one to choose, because, your friend will become really mad at you for some time. If she is really your friend and you tell her parents, It could Save Her life someday. She will Really Value that quality if she is a real friend. <br>  <br>  3. Ask your friends to make her feel included in group activities. Find out why she is cutting her wrists. What is bothering her? Try to get her mind onto something else by including here. get her away from the problem as much as possible. Try to make her Relax and Destress.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Offer to take a Stress Management Class. I know they offer them in many Highschools and having a friend might make her more apt to doing it.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	Let her know that you're there for her when the going gets rough and that hurting herself is not the answer.  If she asks how it affects you, or why you should care, tell her that it hurts you to see her hurting herself.<br>  <br>  If the problem persists, tell a school counselor.  She'll be mad at you at first, but she'll forgive you eventually and it's better than her deciding to go the next step and committing suicide.|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	have her admitted.to hospital ring them you do not have to say who you are/not say my friend just some one and not on the house phone.|`|bvZpJk3Kaa	Report her.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	If you are in school with her, tell the school counselor.

wv9XWQqCaa	Yes, that's true, depending on the female. Girls with more experience tend to like a more endowed man, but making love is not about the size.

You could ask him for help with something that is going on in that class. Or one day pull him aside and ask him advice on something. If he answers you, and starts making conversation then you know that he is at least interested. Once you ask him for advice about something, make sure that you have a follow-up question to ask, or something to talk about. Dating or lettingg someone know that you are interested in them is very hard. The older you get the easier it will get for you.

I would leave it alone for now, if it's really it can wait til she is legal.  Don't be disappointed if things don't work out.

I don't think it's wrong of you to be with him unless you have no feelings for him at all.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	Yea i loved my gf way more.....I broke up with her many  times to...And it is pretty wrong and will cause problems in the future..

mVMA2vk0aa	Yes and I have been on the receiving end of it. Some women (clearly not all) enter into a relationship then try to change the man into what they want him to be. A couple of my friends are just extensions of their partner's ego and it shows in the man's shattered personality.<br>  <br>  In one instance, the man can't be himself (for whatever reason) otherwise he 'cops it' at home, so he becomes what she wants him to be. How pathetic, one of them is so demoralised, he even asks his partner what he should wear (no joke).<br>  <br>  I stood up for myself and verbalised my opinion (my partner used to go out to the clubs till all hours) about her drinking and she just left and met someone else (presumably someone who won't stand up to her). <br>  <br>  Now I know all women are not like this, but in my opinion emotional abuse of men is just as bad as any of the other abuse categories.<br>  <br>  For an interesting read, just Google 'emotional abuse'!!!|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	I would answer but my wife thinks I'm to retarded to use the keyboard.

The more you feel closer to each other, that's when you know that you found the one.<br>  <br>  Also, that special someone can always make you smile and show that they'll always be there for you, to care for you, to protect you always, someone that is committed in sacrificing anything just for your happiness.|`|9Y4tj2Yfaa	Well From the beginning my relationship with my guy has been different I didn't get all fluttery or anything I was just comfortable around him I felt like I could tell him anything and he did the same with me.

That is how i know he is the one.

Some women like a charity case that they can rescue.|`|S3HeBq8haa	A huge wang.|`|Z3YqbtZFaa	this is a dumb question. are you that insecure?|`|bd199fe076f9ab0bc8b166f15319e147aa	if you are talking about yourself in general i'd say you have personality because you are curious enough to use yahoo answers. money is superficial and so are looks. there are so many different definitions of beauty, both physical and internal. you walk down the street and ask someone how they would define beauty it'll be way different than the next person you ask. <br>  <br>  if a woman is only looking for a shallow, good looking guy with money...there is something wrong with her and she probably has syphilis.|`|b9IB8j2Gaa	You've just got to wait around. Make some friends with them and don't think that you have a bad personality. If you did then they would glare at you. Confidence, being friendly, and just being yourself is the key. Best of luck!!!|`|IZq0IQxQaa	uh not to be dumb, but isnt it easier to find a woman that truly loves you if you don't have all the material things or good looks. she will just love you for you with no hidden motive|`|8cdxd1jhaa	I have no clue man.  Women whine and carp about "sexist" men who just refuse to see "her inner beauty", well, I have an inner Spartan but you women refuse to see it.|`|pd0Ggpunaa	The reality...It wont happen.
IVy35SE2aa	if,as you say, you are generally promiscuous, word may have gotten<br>  around.  Take your time with this guy and see if he sticks around.|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	Yes i got one, hold out as long as you can (won't be long since u sound really ready) but holding out will also show him you respect your body|`|56BbQHXEaa	hmmmmmm<br>  HOW ABOUT MARRIEGE???<br>  huh<br>  did u think about that<br>  because seriosly it sickens me wen people have sex with a lot of people<br>  so wat will u hav to give him that is special<br>  because when he has sex with you.. he will be having sex with like 100 people (depends on who your other partners slept and who slept with their partners, list goes on) and you'll be having sex with all the people he slept with that they slept with etc.<br>  woooow so ya sex just isnt special anymore..|`|R3AN5WO0aa	its possible he likes you. and its pretty obvious he does.<br>  you should hold out until you know you wont regret it AND until you fully trust him.<br>  <br>  also think about the consequences.<br>  what if you were to get pregnant?<br>  what if after you have sex he moves onto another girl?<br>  <br>  yea, men are known to do that.<br>  <br>  so the question is bascially all up to you. no one on yahoo knows you as well as you do.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LsE1RS0vaa	you can be intimate by making out and having long passionate kisses. relationships and intimacy are not all about sex. but a month really isn't that long. but if you feel you want to have sex then talk to him about it.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	at least wait a few months you can have fun without sex! have some hot and heavy make out sessions lol use your imagination just keep those pants on for a while sex'll be better after the wait|`|4jx4wAhgaa	I think you should wait.. Its better to wait rather than regret later.. And you only know him for a month, can you guarantee that he will take responsibility? If you want him to respect you, all the more you should wait.. Because if you rush into it, he may think that you are only into sex.. And to be intimate without sex, you can just give him a hug or lay your head on his shoulder and stuff.. He will be able to tell that you love him and that you feel safe with him.. :)|`|DnCpBjPDaa	It's really good you have decided to hold out. If that guy really likes you then he will be satified with you and only you. He should have to earn that right to have sex with you which I like to call marriage. But you can kiss him and just let him hold you in his arms. You can rub his face gently. I wouldn't assume he likes you yet unti he shows you more of his feelings about you.|`|IqB6ZwdUaa	why r u rushin to have sex? lemme tell u somethin, im 17 gonna be 18 this yr and im still a virgin and proud of it. im promiscuous, just like u. u must be a scorpio. but yeah u can do other things, like dry humping(he humps u with ur clothes on) or u can eye **** each other and touch each other w/o having the actual sex. dont rush to have sex with him especially if thats not the guy u really wanna be with for most of ur life, one who cares for u, only if thats the case. but still, even if hes nice, dont rush it, u only knew him for a month.|`|600815e63a0665179ec84ebb672c0a51aa	your like me, but a chick. i used to be like that, but the thing is.. when you want that.. you have to hold off. i set a certain number of times to hang out with my girlfriend before we did. 12 times. that was over a year ago. and shes still my girlfriend. he digs you, no doubt, but hold out. how to be intimate.. i guess cuddle. watch a chill movie. be that girl that he can take around his guy friends and theyll all think shes chill. go to the beach and just talk. talking is better than everyone thinks. just talking.|`|Q05CcPIfaa	i think thats its good that your not gonna jump right in his pants bc youve been dating 3 weeks.... a lot of girls will and if he doesnt already respect you i think he will and should.<br>  have you had sex b4?<br>  i think that you shouldnt say wait til a certain time or do it at a certain time... when you feel the time is right then the time is right|`|kdgdwERaaa	"Sex once only married" is one of the most dangerous concepts in existence|`|prW1i0vzaa	Sex after marriage, hon.|`|L5Z41RINaa	dont hold out, just have fun its a part of life girl....no joke|`|0Gs9LNRQaa	have you had sex before? if soo,, maybe in a month or so ;)|`|eHeEmDg3aa	well i don't know how helpful i can be- i think you and i need to rub off on each other a little haha ;) <br>  i'm almost your opposite.<br>  <br>  In any case, I have always felt that holding hands, quick pecks on the cheek when no one is looking ect ect you get the idea are intimate without getting too intimate, you know?These are little actions that can be done anywhere, they're subtle, [so no PDA! haha I'm not a fan sorry] it shows the guy that you're interested in more than just a sex life. <br>  Making out is also a fun one. but know your limits. If you truly want this guy to wait a while, if he respects you he will. If you've already got a reputation as slightly promiscuous you may want to hold out a while, just to make sure he;s not using you [I'm sure he's nice enough, but i'm generally a cynic] And through looking at friends relationships, sex too soon often breaks a perfectly good relationship. I can't give you a set time for how long you ought to hold out for, that is something you personally need to judge, but i do think tht you out to try to dig yourself out of that reputation hole- that one could easily come back to bite you in the *** later...|`|rruyenPBaa	yes he likes you you should kiss more often|`|W61p5bCfaa	well just as long as ur both comfortable with it, then go for it! but u must always make sure they respect you and are not looking for a "fling". good luck :))|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH HIM YET!<br>  <br>  you can be intimate by kissing, over the blouse action, nothing below the pants, massages, holding hands, talking dirty etc<br>  <br>  wait awhile, get to know him etter, the longer you wait no matter what he says....the longer you wait the more he'll want it, and the more respect he'll have for you<br>  <br>  I honestly think 3 months is good to make him wait but if thats not possible then 2 months|`|9gIvjI9Maa	you've known him now for a month and i think that's great but theres alternatives to having sex. like oral perhaps. that tells him that your interested but not ready to "dive in" and if he is interested in you he should stick around. not for the sex but because he shows a real interest in you.|`|5vNoy7O0aa	Well, if you think of it as a job, than he should be on probation for 3 month and on his best behavior. But wait until you feel you can trust him and that he isnt only in it for sex.|`|W6m1JTeVaa	Sounds like he likes you, hard to tell though im not on the date.<br>  Hold out until the time is right, when you guys get in the moment then the time is right.<br>  Intimate without sex...Messing around, maybe teasing, kinda limited.|`|WmpPVFYiaa	just do what you feel is correct. of course respect is important and you should have him respect you.... never forget that you've known him for a little while and just let things go the way life wants them to.|`|liw7FzxMaa	It all depends how old the dude is because dudes in different ages want different things. but a month is like 2 little to have sex wait at least 3 weeks more or longer if he likes you he can wait|`|HebfnWFDaa	hold out for as long as you can, for yourself.|`|xRCcp6asaa	id say go for it!! <br>  sex is awesome... but see if he wants to or not...

You've only known him for a month or maybe longer.. But wait.. my advice would be to wait till your married...

Don't do anything you will regret... okay....<br>  Good luck...|`|aXf2o2TYaa	A guy likes a girl he has to work for.. Most guys just use promiscuous  girls..

ro5vFj9Aaa	its none of your business. you should not take it upon yourself to be her person to find her someone if she does she will if she does not she won't. i mean its to her entirely and i would hate ot hvae someone treat me like that. each person has their dreams and stuff and soemtimes they dont' go right therefore we also have to take what we have decided to do. shes goingin a direction she wants to go so leave her alone if she was upset she would do something about it.|`|AA10776535	What needs to happen here is everyone needs to leave her alone...what your doing will have the opposite effect.  Let her choose how she want to live, its her life and if she wishes to be single more power to her.  Heck i will never get married again...i date...but there will never be a ring on my finger.<br>  Never...ever... try to rule someones life, respect her decision...One day she may change her mind, leave her be for now.|`|wck4MHREaa	You should throw in your two cents about the situation, I think. It's her life, and she can do anything she wants, but if you care about her, you should tell her that life isn't really worth living that way, and that she's basically giving up on happiness if she continues to do this until she dies.<br>  <br>  I can't articulate well, today, sorry. But I think you get a grasp of what I mean.|`|AA10698792	It's not up to you what is better for her. You have no choice but to respect what she wants.<br>  <br>  Even if she did find someone, there is no guarantee that she would be able to grow old with him...accidents happen, illness can occur.  You don't have to have a man and kids to be happy.
GIsmTQr9aa	It won't bring you anything good that's for sure. If you wanna get rid of him just leave it alone.|`|j8JgSRTnaa	if  your divorcing than no forget even spending the time and money wondering the heck hes doing its soo not worth it|`|EdBCksSwaa	Why dredge up that garbage,you already know he is a jerk,leave it behind you|`|Qq1EHFsXaa	You SHOULD find out.

It must be worrying you alot to even put this question out there in the first place. If hiring a PI gives you closure than do it. Take the bull by the horns.|`|IFd94XDkaa	If you're divorcing him anyway what's the point?  Do you just want to torture yourself more?  I mean seriously, I don't see that it will serve any good purpose.  It will only upset you and cause you to beat yourself up and be more angry at him - all of that is negative.  Put your energy toward other, more positive pursuits.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I would just leave.  Right now that's the most important thing.  After the divorce, if it's still eating at you, hire the P.I. to do some research.  But what good would it do you to know at that point?
jofuVL9Baa	Its a matter of ethics.  I don't know where you can get a PhD.  I hate it when we stumble upon rocks like your advisor seems to be one, but let me tell you some thing:  what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Have you ever thought about how many jerks you will have to interact with the rest of your life?  How are you going to buy your way out of each and every situation you don't like?  You should look into the possibility of transferring to another university, and this would be legal.  Don't let people like your advisor get the best of you.  I'm sure you are much better than that.  And good character is the best trait a person can have, both on a personal and a professional level. Good Luck!|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	College isn't about learning this and that, its about how much crap you can take.  An associates means you put up with 2 years of crap, a bachelors 4, a masters 6.... you see.  If you don't earn a PhD, you don't deserve one.<br>  <br>  Its illegal
OoxOqyvtaa	Stand up for yourself, if you're getting beat up. I mean, don't provoke people, but don't let them hurt you.<br>  <br>  And be yourself, explore your interests.|`|6oxRJwZWaa	Try to find some common ground to talk about, especially when breaking the ice. most rational people will at least give you the courtesy of listening to what you have to say (without beating you), and some of em will really like you. Just saying hi or complementing some one on a job well done is a sure way to make good Friends.<br>  But remember no matter how hard you try not everybody will like you so if a friendship is not working out don't push it will only make it worse.|`|McSE0ES4aa	As long as you don't try to be somebody else in order to make friends, you will be able to make friends. Stay open, but not too open. Move with good intentions. And try making friends on your own :)<br>    There's too much population in this world for you to not make friends:)|`|fjAdjVhkaa	Being yourself is the most important thing. Because if you act different than you really are, it will be forced, and awkward because you are hanging out with people you have nothing in common with. When you are yourself, and you stop caring what other people think about what you say and do, you will make more friends.

wtQY6VEwaa	Yeah, there is an unwritten rule.<br>  <br>  BUT BE WARNED: the no strings attached booty call is a myth. sure, it seems like if for a minute, but that only means one thing: you are doing the booty call, and you arent interesting in the other person. There is always one caller, and one callee. One thinks this is fun and games, and the other thinks this is the window to a new relationship. There is always one side who is bound to get hurt.<br>  <br>  but god damn,  they are fun. and necessary.|`|PxqcLkw1aa	This is exactly why our society is so screwed up.

Wrf5orAuaa	Take the risk. Life's too short to worry about whether someone doesn't really want to talk to you when they may just have a lot of **** going on in their lives. Try it and see. If she doesn't, well it's her loss.|`|Rkik3eUuaa	well, she is not into u. or any other friends cos she is busy with family. she sounds like me - i never call friends and i am too busy to keep in touch. or i just don't want to. if my husband is on a business trip and i want to go out i might call someone, but somehow i do not feel like keeping in touch with people when i do not need anything from them. maybe she is that kind of person. not that she doesn't like u, she is just too private with her own family and her husband is her best friend. if u want to go out u call her, if she is not busy i am sure she will be glad that u called. good luck. there is nothing wrong with u, this is just the way your friend is|`|um6rmdegaa	sounds to me like she doesn't want to have anything to do with you.  i would not call her but that is up to you
RvmYqQtRaa	Talk to her about it a friend will understand. If not, well, you gotta take some time off. Nobody can be everything to everyone as the Everclear song goes. Christ once said "cura te ipsum." it means "first, take care of your own self." Don't be so hard on yourself in fact if I recall you were even with her when she told her parents about the kid. You're a great friend now do something for you.|`|UgJtnut4aa	Just tell her is too much for you and that its hard to keep her secrets, when you do that then its one less thing to worry about but remember to reassure her of your best intensions elsewhere

XD
XGgPhaDbaa	Just tell him that you have thought things over and have decided that he is not the type of person you want in your life. Don't worry about hurting his feelings. You have tried to tell him but he doesn't want to hear you so you have to be blunt.<br>  <br>  Its amazing how people who have nothing going in their life can try to drag down people who do.<br>  I had to cut off some of my friends who drank all the time.|`|0s30aQC6aa	It sounds like you are an adult. As such you just have to tell him you don't swim in the kiddy pool anymore. But it sounds like he isn't going to take any subtle hints so you are going to have to do what all adults eventually do and that is tell him to f**k off.|`|JwNZ7kK5aa	If you just keep saying no, eventually he'll get bored and find someone else. And don't you have caller ID? Every time it's him, just don't pick up the phone.|`|DCfHWPAdaa	it seems like these "friends" of yours are trying to bring you down by telling you to get all behind on what you need to do,, to jus go over there and watch their lives spiral downward. you should just stay away 4rm them. watch them be in the same position STILL in 10 yrs..haha
ZRI6sMlaaa	Nah, it's just her mom. So you can relax. Lol|`|1MmEXfriaa	That's fine. But don't leave your undies in your GF's house again.

She could have at least tried to be a bit understanding. You are in the right, don't let anybody tke it from you. right now, 'll tell you, the other's parents will start finding faults with you that they can use against you to lever your girlfriend away. And they continue all through the marriage as well. Of course, they are old enough to know better but they don't. don't let yourself fall for it, and just practice saying a rebuttal. You do this by rephrasing whatever smarty pants statement they may deliver to you as a question, shoot it back.|`|q1LhYjv1aa	You saved yourself.  But you should be more careful.  Her mom might think you have a problem and start putting plastic on all their furniture.

It takes time there is nothing you can do to "make" him more interested.  If in time say 1 yr or so nothing changes if I were you I would just tell him that you want to be closer than just friends and ask him how he feels about that.  If you try to rush it, this might push him away for good and you won't even have a friendship with him.  And I know for a fact from personal experience that when you try to rush things it makes things worse.  Just go slow.  No need to rush.  If he really likes you then he will like you in a year.

9cb8116fd595599d97cf59e56e8e8289aa	You are a very good friend with a valid reason for concern:  Your friend is young and immature. Only 15?  She should have been better trained and taught at home to not associate with anyone doing drugs and hitting her.  Once a hitter, always a hitter.  She also sounds a little disobedient by not listening to her mom. Not good for you in the long run. She may like you a lot but unfortunately some girls like bad guys for some reason.  Until the good guy finds a good girl eventually when he moves on.  They then realize what they're missing out on and that's when they straighten out.  Too Late!!  What I think you should do is cut off contact with her because hun, she has attracted the wrong type of guy and it could eventually get you hurt in the long run. Or get you caught up in some mess that you don't need to be in. Your heart may heart a little bit during the seperation, but only for a little while. You are going to have to look at this as a training lesson on what not to like or look for in a girl/girlfriend. Sometimes you've gotta keep some distance or you'll fall in a heart trap.  If you continue with the relationship, it's going to get harder to break away. You'll give mixed signals, SHE'LL give mixed signals because she's not happy with who she is with anyways, and you'll waste a bunch of time while a bunch of nice girls your type stride right on by you.  I hope this helps you.  Please take care and be smart.|`|SckWdjnVaa	Take a break.....try figuring out exactly what kind of a gal u hv in mind & accordingly check if any one of these gals fit into the picture!!!<br>  <br>  Dont just jump & grab the first available option!!!!|`|Qq1EHFsXaa	You need to look out for yourself.

B4agXHZGaa	first of all DONT talk to this new girl about her..at all. you want to make it seem like you have no other girl on your mind other than this new one.<br>  <br>  as far as this "non virgin" girl, ive seen this too many times to tell you that she is just going to keep going back to this dude. and if shes talking about you like that, and saying your just friends, then you just got to forget about it man. just move on and theres a slight chance once she sees you with another girl and such, she might start liking you. females are very complex haha, they want what they can't have. <br>  <br>  my advice would be stick with this new girl bro, as you already said shes nice, virgin ha, and most of all not tied up with a previous ex. i can promise things will work out for the better if you continue things with the new one. and remember to not talk about the old girl with her and to just play it cool. after all she is just 15 ..plenty of mature fish in the sea lol<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  take it easy brah|`|Ao0G4EUqaa	I think you should ditch the other girl, she sounds like a complete idiot and you sound to good for her. the other girl sounds really nice, start fresh and go with her!|`|G8lelzNMaa	.|`|S9sZawG2aa	There's nothing you can really do about your friend who was in the abusive relationship except for letting her know that if she ever wants out you will support her.<br>  <br>  If you want the green eyes girl to like you, stop talking about the other girl. I don't think you've ruined your chances YET, but be careful. For the next week or two just be really nice to green eyes. Don't tell her tthat you like her right away, because then she'll think you're a player since you just said you liked her friend.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Who are you talking about him her mom she me.??|`|pSpWOsiQaa	wha !
O4qO8aoLaa	What you did was wrong.  Have some respect for her.  She's not a ****!  I realize you liked this girl but she obviously didnt like you in the same way.  Now that your interested in her friend, you might as well forget it buddy.  Reason being, friends always talk about guys to each other.  She probably already told her.  She probably wont give you the time of day.  You might have even lost her as a friend.  You probably killed it with the girl you started to like.  Just because she is/isnt a virgin doesnt make her a ****.  Makes her human.  It would be different if she was banging every guy in sight.  She isnt.  You were being too hard on her.  This might come off as mean but....You need to move on and get over yourself.|`|AA10953999	Yeah why is she a ****? She is in an abusive relationship, how does that make her a ****? I bet if she had slept with you instead of that guy she wouldn't be considered a **** in your eyes. Maybe she is right about you being jealous. BTW Girls usually do not like guys that call their friends names.|`|03rggPF2aa	well i was going to give you advice, but then you made the mistake of calling her a **** because she was sexually active and made it seem like it was a requirement for a girl to be a virgin when you said that the other girl being a virgin was a good thing.<br>  <br>  it is neither a good or bad thing for a woman to be sexually active. it is natural. stop being sexist!

He's always on here giving legal advice, claiming to be a paralegal in Florida, but most the time his "legal" advice is wrong.<br>  <br>  Here is the reason you aren't getting child support.......your ex is on SSI. Child support cannot be taken from SSI....Federal Law.<br>  Don't take my word for it, its easy to check out. Type in SSI/child support in any search engine such as Yahoo or Google, then read some of the links.<br>  Also try this, look up some NY attorneys and call a couple. They will tell you the same thing. Now if your ex was on SSD, that would be different, you could collect, but not as long as he is on SSI.<br>  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The best thing here for you to do is keep hounding them til they do something. Theyre supposed to track him down as a deadbeat dad and have the means to do so. You may want to contact your local TV news station or newspaper if they have a helpline and see if they will help you. Its worth the try, but somebody should have known something by now at least. Keep pushing and dont let up.You have more to gain by pushing them. Good luck|`|fjCxv2I4aa	sounds like you need an attorney,they'll track him down.
52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Teens are people.  They have feelings.  They have opinions (some for valid reasons, some for not so valid reasons). They can't seem to express them appropriately half the time and can't seem to make too many logical and rational choices.  (This is just the curse of youth.)  Also, they tend to be extremely thick headed.<br>  <br>  The young are smart, but they are not very wise.  Generally that wisdom is something that the old are trying desperately to convey to the young.<br>  <br>  You get back from the old what you give.  If your respectful and polite...you will get that back.  If your a jack*ss with an FU tone your gonna get attitude back.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	i know how you fell my parents downsize me all the time im sick of it|`|4EWCegiRaa	You're right but it's all about persepctive.  If you think school is unimportant, you want to kill yourself because your crush doesn't love, and you only shop at the "cool" stores, your opinion doesn't count because you have no idea what you're talking about.  ALOT (not all) teenagers have no grip on reality and those ignorant teens ruin it for all teens.|`|gocQ9ND5aa	the reason many adults treat teenagers  is because many teens are a real pain in the a$$. you get annoyed with people who claim that you think you know everything, well if most teens did not act like they know everything then they  would be treated different. one last thing as a teen you really don't have a clue what real pain is, Many teens tend to turn a simple problem into a disaster. This happens because you think you know everything. <br>  <br>  So go ahead and tell me i am wrong, I know many will, but do one thing for me and print your question and my answer out and read it in about 20 years and you will know what I am talking about.|`|kjV9QqwSaa	I try not to stereotype teenagers as being stupid, I make my<br>  opinions on a case by case basis. I have recently met teenagers<br>  who acted very intelligent and mature.|`|jofuVL9Baa	You are soo right.  As an adult, I can tell you I hate it when adults disrespect teenagers.  We have absolutely no right to treat you bad.  Of course, respect is some thing that is earned as well.  But you have legitimate feelings and I hope you know that not every body sees teenagers this way that you feel.  Just for the sake of fairness, and I suspect this has to do with your parents, I just want you to know that what they mean to say is that you've got so much of life ahead of you, that some times we parents wish we could make things easier for you, and we wish our children -no matter what age- didn't have to go through the negative things we've gone through...we some times just don't know how to say things and they come out wrong, thus making you feel the way you do.  As far as knowledge, the only thing I can say is the older I get, the more I know, I know nothing.  Its not a matter of age, its a matter of how much you are willing to learn and understand from life.  I'm really sorry you feel this way, because of some one that has made you feel this way.  It's not right and I hope you know that the people who we love the most are the ones who can  hurt us the most, and the ones who love us the most some times don't know how to express what they really mean. I hope this helps, Good Luck!|`|TM7g8NXraa	First off, is your parent/parents really calling you stupid cause if so that's a problem to begin with and I get why you are feeling this way. <br>  <br>  Im a parent of a 17 year old boy. We know you do have feelings but what happens to you now is not the end of the world like you may think or feel and know that you have a whole life ahead of you when there will be real significant circumstances and you will realize that what happended 10 years before was really not that big of a deal compared to what your "new" situation might be...<br>  <br>  How do we know that???<br>  <br>  Because we were once your age too and felt that way as well but now that I am older I can trully say that my mom was right!!!|`|V5JJK8Okaa	some of adults especially our parents still treat us as if we are still children thats why sometimes they thought that what we have on our minds are still useless or nonsense.
pGLTlfiWaa	just ask him staright out if he likes you,,, because it sounds like he does.   if he says no he doesnt like you then ask him why he waS calling you honey, sweetie, etc.|`|d3OaReBYaa	Well of course he is interested in you he is just a flirt. Try going on a real date instead of texting, then you will see for sure.|`|IQfaj1BGaa	he likes you<br>  those cute little nicknames gave it away<br>  you should ask him out ;]|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	ok but he obviously likes you so just get to know him better and you can see for yourself whether or not you really like him back and if you guys are compatible enuff to give it a try. good luck tho.|`|AaXl5YYkaa	have you ever liked two guys at once and had trouble choosing? i'm sure you have a crush on more than one person or did at one time. its not a big deal. he is probably a decent guy and it sounds like he likes you :)|`|EJSdI25Naa	At last I hear about a guy who is doing exactly what I would tell everybody. Have a lot of girlfriends and boyfriends. One is just for the pits. Now, you hav played 'hard-to-get' long enough. Do you think texting is all that it takes to make everlasting love? It doesn't. You are inexperienced, that's all. Get your own experiences. talk with all the guys. You are not going to end up marrying one of them, are you? At the best, not for years and years away yet.<br>  <br>  However, you really will have to get rid of the "I OWN him" attitude that is shrieking loud and clear to me. He might not even see it until too late and that would be the worst punishment -- an intolerable life sentence. He will not love you, he will hate you. So, missy, what's it to be. A delightfully happy young lady, doing well at school, kind and considerate or the *****? <br>  <br>  Over to you.|`|IaIs8foRaa	this is a hard one. I would say wait it out and see if anything changes or if you hear something else. I was in the same situation that your are in my ex boyfriend told his previous girlfriend the same thing he told me and would text us at the same time. Who knows what he was saying to the both of us. But in the end I felt like i was getting played I thought he liked me too he called me baby and flirted with me ,would text me til 5am and made me feel special. So my advice to you is to be careful you can never be sure if guys are playing you now and days. Good Luck!|`|S9sZawG2aa	he sounds like a player... but players are fun if you drive them crazy and don't let them play you. ONLY kiss him, and he'll do anything to get you to do more, but don't give in, just bask in his attention. hahha :]|`|26yK666Paa	All guys are players until they meet "the one."  If you two are into each other, things will happen without all the playing......otherwise, he's just not that into you.|`|hXehbPVqaa	he sounds like a try hard player ... like he doesnt get the girls but he texts heaps. you might just have to ask him if he text other girls and you will see if he is lying or not by the way he acts|`|kTB9PWRnaa	Start flirting with him|`|rOMTKmjDaa	He likes you.|`|66Fhsm0vaa	he sounds like a player, but you never really know i guess. try actually hanging out with him, not just texting! hehe|`|9bc19c730e5798e2c591eadee2b71ec1aa	Well I think if all you do is text, after awhile it may get boring and you run out of things to really have a nice discussion. Try doing things. And hold back from the sex and see if he really respects you. Give it a little time but let him know you are interested.Just hold back a little. You will get to know him more and then you will find out if he is a player. Follow your heart, but protect yourself. You know you can trust you more than what other people say.|`|7MH3NW7Caa	OKAY, DONT LISTEN TO OTHERS, SEE IT FOR YOUR SELF.<br>  IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE I WOULD COUNTINUE TALKING WITH HIM AND MAYBE IN A WEEK OR SO, JUST ASK HIM DOES HE HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU<br>  <br>  <br>  HEY SOMETHING MIGHT COME OUT OF THAT SINCE HES ALLREADY SAYING SWEET STUFF LIKE " BABY, SWEETIE, AND ALL OF THAT ";-)<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|5HJqKEnRaa	If the days/ weeks start adding up and hes still talking to you and really listening to you that much then he does actually really like you.<br>  <br>  Most guys wouldn't give a s**t, but because hes putting a lot of time and effort into you it shows he does.|`|aAkgXmIOaa	i knew a guy like that, sweet, makes you feel like your special. most likely your not the only one.|`|BfQd59g9aa	you cant jump to conclusions so early it seems like this guy is intrested in you but you need to start going on dates comming from a guys point of veiw ive ben down that road before unfortunatly and it is so easy talking to different girls it seems right now u guys got fone love unless u left sumin out but if you like this guy and u feel he feels the same then u need to try him out and see what hes all about unless ur blind a girl should always tell the difference between a genuine guy and a player who wants so buttif he does like you it would make sense to ask you out but then again mayb hes got the same problem you do... so i jus ask him out to lunch mayb coffee i or if u wanna go full blown romance do dinner and see if hes all that|`|K6q6YvJWaa	If he's only texting you and not talking to you then you already have a problem.  Relationships and feelings shouldn't be built over a keyboard.  That's the problem with most 'relationships' today.  Hang up the phone and TALK to the boy.  If he's calling you baby and sweetie and hasn't even taken you on a date or had a real conversation with you then this guys is most likely playing between you and the other guy seeing who he likes better.

HxXduL1maa	Here are some simple first kiss tips and first kiss advice that will ensure your first kiss is truly magical.<br>  <br>  There are no hard and fast rules about who should kiss first. It’s more important to make sure it’s something you both want and that you are not in a rush when you do kiss for the first time.<br>  <br>  Your first kiss with a new partner should be done in private, and in an environment where you are less likely to be interrupted by any family and friends.<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that your first kiss with a new person may not be as smooth or as romantic as you would have liked. Your partner may not be a very good kisser first off. But that’s okay. You can take up the challenge yourself to teach your love interest the delightful art of kissing on a daily basis with these same kissing tips mentioned here.<br>  <br>  When you are thinking of making the move to a first kiss make sure you regularly brush your teeth and have either mint lollies or chewing gum always handy to ensure your breath smells fresh and tastes fresh and inviting.<br>  <br>  If you want your first kiss to be memorable for both of you make sure you are both sober to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Your first kiss is the scariest. If you are nervous, chances are that your love interest is also nervous. You can tell a lot about a person about the way they kiss. It is important to build yourself up and to focus on enjoying your first kiss experience as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Your first kiss together will be the most nerve wracking. After you get over the initial anticipation and onset of nerves you can then concentrate on making your kissing encounters as hot, sexy and delicious as possible. Chances are that seconds into your first kiss you will start to feel more relaxed and confident.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that you don’t have to kiss anyone until they are 100 percent ready. There is no time limit. You are not Cinderella and you are not going to turn into a pumpkin if you haven’t kissed by midnight. Don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something that you are not ready for. Also, never kiss a person that you don’t feel is ready for your kiss. It’s much more exciting to build up the anticipation until you are both ready than risking rejection and being seen as too forward or pushy.<br>  <br>  While your first kiss together is fantastic, it’s all the kisses that follow that will make your pulse race, your heart stop and take your breath away.<br>  <br>  Remember that in time your memories fade but the memory of your first kiss together will linger forever. You may remember what you were wearing or how they smelt or what you both ate. But what you will definitely remember is the feeling you had all through your body when your lips touched theirs and you shared your first intimate moment together.|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	there is always a first time for every thing<br>  go for it<br>  just make sure that you stay in limits the first time<br>  its a wonderful experience<br>  have a great time|`|xv2ImqGBaa	you should try it,<br>  but don't cross your limits.<br>  also think first is the boy really worthy of your kiss.|`|rK4b5yrOaa	if u love me so i tell u <br>  9250692382<br>  is my no. <br>  i live in india|`|xQGCf8GGaa	is that boy worthy of ur kiss<br>  ask ur self then give him what he want|`|GHZnLiYvaa	Well, it's something that doesn't depend upon his wish alone. That's something which you would feel to go for too. And yeah, when you would feel it, you wouldn't ask the permission to go for it to your partner. Believe me! It just happens!

He probably does like you, but just can't say it out.

Lol. Your in school so your young and have a LONG way to go. You do deserve to be treated properly at all times so your best bet is to not get into bad habits of letting someone treat you bad.

You could try talkin to him but its likely that it would be easier to nail Jell-o to a tree! Much luck - take care of you first.|`|kxzcilZzaa	It sounds like he probably likes you, but he doesn't sound like the kind of guy you'd want to waste your time on, not to mention it's not a good idea to get with a person like that who doesn't even seem to be comfortable with themselves. If you were considering it that is|`|vdmqdlNfaa	I don't think its a case of like / hate.<br>  He's just being childish that's all.

AA11666549	Since it sounds like you like her why don't you go up to her? You can always start by asking her what shes reading. She may be new to the school and a little shy and may not be good at making friends, So tomorrow at school walk up to her make conversation. Don't be one of those people that don't go up to her, make a friend. It sounds like she doesn't have any and she reads because it keeps her from just sitting there looking lonely, it keeps her preoccupied. Go make a friend.|`|TiZEswxYaa	shes shy! i bet she feels horrible sitting there all alone. maybe you should try talking to her|`|28IB6U2paa	They are intimidated.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	They might want something right away, move and contact them again and c what will they say about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|GVVoTtp8aa	Do you have money??? Think about that one.<br>  <br>  Also it could be for a booty call and your not readily available. So they go on the next. <br>  <br>  I personaly wouldnt look for people online.|`|CxhH2xSQaa	Dude you need to quit myspacing it....that is LAME-O. And you are probably not gonna get that great of a woman from myspace anyway. How old are you? If you are over 18 you need to quit that shi*<br>  <br>  You should, however, join clubs, volunteer, and meet up with your new coworkers a lot when you first move. Join clubs that relate to your job--if you are in business join the local "young business people" club, if you are in the arts join MOMA or local art activist clubs, sign up for community service. Also a cool online site: meetup.com has a ton of online clubs you join to get you off online and meeting groups of people that share your similar interests. They cater to all sorts of people, no doubt you will find something on this site that fits you. <br>  <br>  Also, remember, it's smarter to rack up GUY friends first, guys who may have girls as friends, sisters, cousins, friends of friends etc you will eventually meet and will also have an endorsement from your new guy friend!<br>  <br>  Don't run off with the first bit*h you meet on myspace, that is dumb, and not safe. This also limits who you can meet, you are going to New York, make it count, make it special, and who knows where you can be if you don't limit yourself and allow yourself to meet all kinds of people...not just myspace chicks.<br>  <br>  And, as far as the whole losing interest thing...who cares...once you get there you will have enough time to blend in...just be confident and know that something better awaits you.|`|AA10108216	It's because we're used to being lied to online...so they might figure you're just another guy pretending to move there.  And if you aren't available right away...they might think you aren't serious.
UwEEHuRcaa	That wasn't a bad question to ask her. Maybe she is having a good think. I must say though, if what you say about the pics and so on is true, it is a strange thing to do. You'd think she'd be happy to show you pics of your dad. Is there anyone else in the family you can ask about this?
nUqGDTvxaa	he likes you. go talk to him and stop playing games.|`|AA11119075	its a trust issue.|`|Ot34f3Ndaa	Don't listen to anyone. Talk to him and ask if you two can bury the hatchet the longer you wait the more akward it will be.
AA11082914	Not for sure, but with the pillars in the back, it looks like either Davinci or Impression. I like it. It looks really similar to my fave Maggie Sottero dress, Estella.<br>  <br>  *ADD* Wow, that was a good guess. It's Davinci. Here's a link to the dress on their site.    <br>  <br>  <a href="http://wwww.davincibridal.com/catalog.php?cat=22&im_id=77&page=76" rel="nofollow">http://wwww.davincibridal.com/catalog.ph...</a>|`|3WE4Mtblaa	maybe Davinci Wedding Gown .<br>  i found it on <a href="http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/weddingdress.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/weddi...</a>|`|yzmBNxbbaa	It's a very pretty dress but it is a little trendy with the way the skirt is layered not sure if you'll think it's as pretty 10 years from now.
o65klEwWaa	When your 11 yo niece comes to stay with you, you effectively become her guardian during the period she is under your supervision. <br>  <br>  In that capacity, you have your excuse for taking her to ER. To put it another way, if her dad comes back at you with accusations as to why you stuck your nose in, then you can say that she was being supervised by you and you were very concerned about the excessive bruising and pain. How did you know about it, well she asked you for pain killers and you investigated. Simple.<br>  <br>  You can either take her to ER, or phone the police and ask them if they recommend going to ER or to the police department. But don't talk to your niece until the last moment, otherwise you'll scare her.<br>  <br>  Sounds like she maybe was trying to tell you anyway without actually breaking her promise to her dad. Poor thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck and good on you for caring.|`|kEy3W5ydaa	WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DENSE....THE KIDS BEING RAPED BY HE OWN FATHER....take her to the hospital and have them check her out and document the bruising and get her out of that situation and into therapy....<br>  <br>  WHAT ARE U WAITING FOR>>>MOVE|`|AA10953999	Thats ******* sick. I hope they cut his dick off and shove it up his ***.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	you really need to contact the police and get DHS involved ASAP. GET OFF THE INTERNET AND TAKE HER TO THE ER! Don't let her go back with her dad! Stop being so naive !|`|2t4PRzEQaa	Even if she's scared to go, you HAVE to take her to the emergency room right away. Reassure her that everything will be alright and she won't get into trouble with her father. It's really plain to see that she is being sexually abused, and she's trying to tell you. You need to let the authorities know RIGHT AWAY to put this little girl out of danger and put her life back on track. This is so wrong...|`|TdRTPOPKaa	You need to take her to the emergency room right away. She needs to be seen by a doctor. They might have to do a rape kit on her based on what you have written above. You will have to explain to your niece that she has done nothing wrong and that nothing bad will happen to her. Tell her that you love her and that you will be there for her. In my opinion, she needs to be seen as soon as possible.|`|O4qO8aoLaa	Uh yeah.  Take pictures of her legs and take her to the ER.  By law they have to report it.  The proper authorities will be called.  Even if she doesnt want to go, you have to make her.  Its in her best interest.  Just reassure her its not her fault.|`|43y0iwSdaa	Ok oh my goodness are u blind this 11 old girl is trying to tell u whats right in your face are u blind?? She is def getting abuse we sexually n u should take her to the doctor and tell someone immedietly|`|03rggPF2aa	yes. call the police NOW!!!!!|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Of course she is!  Are you blind?  And by telling you that, she is asking you for help!  You need to take some pictures before she leaves your house and take action!!  You know in your heart what is going on.  How many more "signs" do you need?  If what you are saying is true, then there is no doubt!  C'mon...get real!   Report the problem to the authorities and get it dealt with!  Take those pictures, and if you can, record a conversation with her!  It's your responsibility.  You can act really casual about it with her, and not tell her that you told anyone.  She might not make the connection.  But even if it's obvious that it was you, and even though it's a tough situation to be in.....you have to help her!|`|oZRfb0eAaa	I think you know the answer all ready lv,you need to get her some help staite away, take to hospitail and have her looked at, they will help you with your dilema, its hard and fritening to do but you need to protect this vunrable child, even if it isnt the dad some thing is very wrong, stay strong lv and help her, there could be more kids than you think getting hurt,by this person (could be his friends as well,) good luck lv stay strong, but i think you know what to do. from bb. resure her tell her you care for her ,whens she due to go back to the dad ?,dont under any surcumstance let them be alone together make up an excusse that your going to take her out to the pictures or shopping, any thing just reasure her that everthing will be ok that nothing is her fault,she didnt ask for this situation now we have to stand up and give her the support  she needs.|`|wBffQgPiaa	Take her to the ER IMMEDIATELY.
YRJFo6K0aa	Take her somewhere memorable that ties in to your common interests; perhaps a park, zoo, museum, picnic, cat show, coffee shop with live music, canoe ride, finger-painting party, you name it. Take a look in your local newspaper or search the internet to see if there are any fun events going on near you. If you aren't sure what she would most enjoy, try figuring out what she likes through subtle questions (if you want to surprise her) or just ask her. Be creative and have fun!<br>  <br>  As for dress, just wear something clean, comfortable, and appropriate for wherever you're going.|`|8wi2X5sSaa	take her to a classic restaurant or something. its the best place to get to know each other more while you get to eat! =) oh, and also, dont take her to the movies because it doesnt consist of much communication esp if its the first date.|`|8fB5oh9jaa	this, my friend, is dependent upon the one you are with. Eberybody has different obsessions. Use these to find where to go. If she REALLY likes llamas, go to a llama farm and feed them. If she really like S & M, go to a sex shop and pick out toys together.
L6DZZ6SJaa	can your family come and witness the marriage, or will it be closed off and just you guys and a witness? If close family and friends can come, then go for it. See if your parents/family can ask around and see if people would be willing to go to a dinner together afterward instead of a formal reception. This way, they can all be there to share with you and you can save money as well.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	What's the rush to get married, when you can't afford the wedding you want to have?<br>  <br>  If you're truly meant to be together, then wait until you've saved up and are able to make it how you want it to be. If you're truly meant to be together, a year or two won't matter in 50 years when you're celebrating your golden anniversary - will it?<br>  <br>  What's 2 years against your whole life ahead of you?<br>  <br>  Starting a marriage broke and with no money might seem romantic, and it might make it all sound like an adventure, but the day to day stresses really add up all by themselves without adding "we're broke" into the mix.<br>  <br>  Just wait ! Save, plan, and do it when you're able to make it the wedding you both want.<br>  <br>  Best of luck !!|`|Us8XGb3caa	its about you 2 not everyone else. So even though your family wants a wedding, you should just have what you want. people have big weddings they can not afford and end up in debt before there lives even start together. then it takes longer to buy a house and all those other things|`|LlsCclIcaa	I honestly dont understand the rush. My partner and i are in the same situation. we got engaged in december, and we have a lot of trouble saving up as well, in fact we are just breaking even at the moment. we love each other dearly and we know one day it will happen we just have to be patient. We are planning to get married in 2011 or 2012 because we need to save up. We have also decided to move back in with my fiance's parents, so that we are able to save up a lot more.<br>  <br>  im sure youre family will understand if you waited until you have the budget saved together
e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	So it seems like your confidence level is so down.  It's what you think about yourself that's putting you down, your own image about yourself not the girls.  You get what you project.  It's your ego that's making you suffer because you're wanting to be appreciated, you're wanting to be loved.  You gotta love yourself first, you have a lot of qualities that other girls are looking for.  Don't put yourself down.  It's mostly problems in your head.  Get rid of those negative thoughts and face reality. Drop all those thoughts, and there's no problem.  Think more positive.  If you feel you need to be alone then feel your aloneness.  The source of happiness comes from within you. Your life is yours to create.
sjIRlWt3aa	One question...HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL THIS GUY YOUR BOYFRIEND?! I mean...yes sure things might've have been lovey dovey for you guys before-hand, but that has obviously changed. <br>  <br>  You're talking abuse here!!! That's illegal and if you're being threatened because of that, you HAVE to do something about it. What can you do?? You can talk to your friends about it. Or maybe some of his friends that aren't so phsycotic. Tell them to pass the message that you don't feel comfortable. I don't know what family issues ur having and i don't want to ask you either because that's something private but....if you can....you should talk to your gaurdians or whoever you're staying with. <br>  <br>  Nobody has the right to abuse you like that and you should be able to stick up for yourself. You can call kids help phone. I don't know exactly why you can't call the police either...=/ but....I dunno. You really should if it isn't too much of a burden on you. If he's threatening you like that, and it seems like he's pretty darn serious, then you have to be careful.<br>  <br>  Stick around with a couple of your friends for a while. Be careful!!!!! =S<br>  <br>  Good luckk.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Well then if you won't call the cops, he won't go away.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	O.o whoa<br>  <br>  ok, i would say call the police or get a restraining order but if u really think it would make things worse, then u have to protect urself. sorry to say, but if its that bad MOVE AWAY.

You are choosing to leave yourself wide open for abuse.  But that is your choice.  No one can make you take legal action.<br>  <br>  Should you hurt him or do something to him, no jury in the world (in this day and age of help for the abused) is going to take pity on you.  They will hold you responsible for taking the law into your own hands.|`|7Fc22teCaa	BF needs a restraining order.|`|JajEhcsUaa	Looks like you're screwed, either kill him and become the next coke baron, or leave him for the paper boy.|`|7EM6KnA3aa	Report the police.|`|JxYzhAILaa	ARE YOU CRAZY, OR JUST STUPID ????<br>  <br>  YOU JUST CAN NOT HELP STUPID|`|WcNsMmDZaa	some females just dont realize how good they got it...<br>  learn your place woman|`|g6MiGWuJaa	get some mace or a gun and teach him a lesson|`|JITTMjasaa	That's bull... Your a lady and should be treated as one, not a play thing to be tossed around. You need to be in control of your life because people like that can end it. He has no right to do that to you. Don't take that crap from him. Don't let him belittle you into thinking that your not worth a fight. You are. Now fight for yourself and get some backup. If your family is preventing you from getting protection, they should protect you. If they can't, get the cops involved. This is serious and needs to be dealt with now, before it's too late. You deserve better than that. Don't let him win, and don't lose yourself. Good luck, God Bless|`|6p6JB09laa	well, you have maybe 3 real choices if you can't call the police.<br>  #1.- hire a 1st guy to hire some bad guys to take care of him, <br>  2.- have your chauffeaur video him stalking you from the limo/car and if he beats you , take pictures or video of it and the wounds. and take them to the bad guys or police anyway.<br>  3.

29zyJ95Eaa	Oh honey, I know completely how you feel. I have my times when I cry maybe once a day and I can get hurt easily but this seems like a constant thing for you.<br>  I'm 15 and I have 2 medical problems. I have diabetes type 1, which doesn't really get in the way but it sucks, and then I have an underactive thyroid disorder. I was diagnosed with this thyroid disorder when I was 7 but from 5 - 12 I was severely bullied. Because when your thyroid is underactive, you slow down in growth, you gain weight, basically everything in  your body slowed down. So I was the smallest human being in every school I went to until I turned 13... yeah it pretty sucked. But now, I think, 'screw them, they are probably failing at life right now and will never have a successful life just because they laughed at me for being short.' it is probably true.<br>  But still to this day I have low self esteem, sometimes I just can't handle life anymore and this is when I can relate to you - just not so much..<br>  I don't know you, but your bestfriend is a total crackhead by ditching you for her boyfriend. That is just wrong. She ditched you when you needed her the most. How selfish!<br>  I really feel the need to give you a hug..... :(<br>  But what I can say, I've slooooowly built up confidence over time by just talking to some people.. it does really help.<br>  F*ck going to a club, some trip or something - that's what most people will say you need to do.<br>  Imagine yourself in a party, with the hottest guy in town.<br>  Dancing to the music - try dreaming of this in your sleep.<br>  Listen to some songs that will make you feel happy.<br>  The song 'Another Day - Jamie Lidell' always cheers me up when I'm in a sad mood, or if I'm not in a sad mood it will make me happy about my life right now.<br>  Or even try going to a college or something thats especially for your talent or something you might want to go into or become.<br>  Go on a website thats for your talent, maybe you can write some stories in your free time on the internet.<br>  But whatever you do, you will always be beautiful and special in your own way. I don't just say this to anyone.<br>  I can tell that you are quite a decent, trusting, non-selfish person and it's hard to find someone with those qualities, and it seems that the people that do have this, suffers the most.<br>  <br>  Don't let anybody get you down, just keep thinking "I AM going to get through this. I AM going to be strong, I AM better then this."<br>  At first you'll be like "what the, this isn't working??? what was that girl talking about??" but over time it will :)<br>  <br>  Just remember that you are amazing, you have qualities that not most people have. Ok, you haven't had a GREAT start of life BUT if you had the normal typical life, you wouldn't have those qualities. Do you see where I'm going?<br>  <br>  I can tell by just reading your grammar and your way of words that deep inside you, you are the strongest person anybody could be, but you just don't know it yet.
kkhJH6k2aa	I like that kinky **** too <3<br>  <br>  i've never known why. I think it has something to do with the idea of being crazy and letting ourselves loose and not being so innocent? maybe so. either way, a good slap on the booty or blind-folding/chaining onto the bed makes me all a flutter.<br>  <br>  my question is, don't you like it? i'd imagine that being able to do terrible things to a seemingly innocent looking girl would be a major fantasy for a guy. we look sweet and virginal, but we're real sex panthers with fetishes and primal instinct that make us rabid with sexual hunger, grrrr!!

qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Leona, I think when during intercourse,<br>  guys were fully focusing on hitting the right spot ( or should I call banging ? )<br>  while we were hitting the spot with so much of energy,<br>  this maybe give us less time to moan as we're pumping and pumping<br>  and we need to go to the climax with full force of energy,<br>  so, if we try to groan, maybe the energy could decrease and<br>  in turn, it'll never be fulfilling to either of the bedroom partners.<br>  And when ladies groans, <br>  I had the feeling that though they're tired but they're not using their energy<br>  while they're lying.<br>  So think about it whether it make sense ?|`|LGCcmJ5Zaa	No. Some Guys Just Don't Moan Or Make Any Noise Same With A Girl. It Does Mean They Didn't Enjoy It. And In Time They May become More Comfortable And Start Making Noise.|`|cVhuFVWSaa	I'm sure it's different reasons for all of them. If it's something you like just talk to your partner and tell them that you really enjoy when you can hear how good it feels for him. It's possible he just doesn't want you to be uncomfortable with it, or he trying not to focus on how good it feels so he can last longer. Be open with your sexual partners and ask them to be open with you. The sex will improve and you both will be more at ease!|`|wtQY6VEwaa	Guys don't moan because they are used to jerking off in their rooms or the bathroom. It feels great, but they don't let out a peep cause they dont want mama in the kitchen hearing it.<br>  <br>  If you want your man to make a little noise, let him know. I don't make a sound when i jerk off, but i let my girl know when i am enjoying myself in the bedroom. or kitchen. or laundry room.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	I roar like a bear,|`|eeHgm5hGaa	well think about, it who shoves what in who's where?|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	i would imagine it does.  i have been married and have a great sex life w/my husband, but he makes no noise at all.  As you said, not even during an orgasm.  <br>  I would like to know the answer to this also.|`|C8v47HIGaa	usually during orgasm you can't contain yourself and some type of noise comes out..its like a natural instinct. kind of weird that you've found someone who doesn't at all.|`|bdKcaOEOaa	No... well kind of... ppl varry. also sumtimes itz not 2 intense|`|aLKXnw5Haa	no its just what makes him, him.  everyone is a little different. however, those who do not moan or let you know they climax sure make boring sex partners IMO|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Don't know ask them.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	because they just don't...it doesn't mean anything...wouldn't it be a little weird if a guy was like OOOOH YES OOOO YES MORE MORE MORE? <br>  <br>  <br>  I would think it was really weird and a turn off.|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	I grunt like a caveman when i ***.|`|pkFkP8g3aa	guys moaning is kinda gay...bet gay guys moan like a chick but I'll NEVER know EVER NEvER|`|qv25Q4aaaa	It just depends on the person and how they were raised and what not.<br>  <br>  For example me, i don't make any noise at all because i was raised in a very conservative household where things like that are sorta "taboo".<br>  <br>  i guess if i guy is raised in a more outgoing family, and grew up being able to masturbate freely and what not he is more likely to be loud.<br>  <br>  also, it depends on the personality, some people are just quiet by nature|`|gWNIsWYsaa	my boyfriend used to be the same way but i told him it kinda bothered me cause i'm siting here making noise and he's just like, straight face. <br>  he said he ws just uncomfy with doing that because he never has before, so he finally got more comfortable with making some noise around me<br>  <br>  but if he was like OMG YESSS<br>  then dude, no|`|6p6JB09laa	some do , most don't ..men don't usually express themselves much emotionally ..they just enjoy their "work".<br>  those who aren't afraid to open themselves up to you, their true self,  around you ,will..<br>  when you find a real man who does make all the sounds and noises and talks to you during love making, i'll buy you the car you wanted..oopps, did i let that slip out?|`|H7KEJ0Fjaa	Some guys don't want to make things awkward and don't feel comfortable making noise.

elefAyGWaa	Of course women can be just as shallow as men, it's not a gender-specific behavior.  Then again, you cannot generalize it to be all men and all women who behave this way.  Maybe you being muscular now is me attractive because you are taking an interest in your health and your body, and that sort of discipline and care for yourself is attractive to more women.  I don't know the reason, exactly, but the stereotype of a healthy and muscular young man is potentially more attractive initially to women.  For this sort of thing, it's the initial attraction that is being affected, and maybe you are carrying a more attractive attitude towards yourself and everything.<br>  <br>  I don't know exactly, but I do know that yes, women can certainly be as shallow as men sometimes.|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	muscular men are more attractive only to a certain audience. it DOES show that you take care of yourself and respect your body, and therefore would probably respect your girlfriend too.<br>  <br>  connecting with someone has to happen physically on a certain level. i don't prefer a guy who is totally ripped (b/c then he might be more into himself than into me), but i do like a guy who is well-groomed and takes care of his body.|`|LZiZtBdTaa	I guess that first impression counts. I mean if there is a hot guy walking by why not look? In my eyes it's sexy but if the girl gets to know you more that's when the personality starts to count. And also no matter how ripped you are you could still look attractive by you apperance. Just put on a beater and a black shirt and it looks hot too. And in the end, everybody likes something else. :)|`|uUWjOh9Paa	I was just talking to my guy friend about this. To me, I honestly couldn't care less about what a guy looks like, unless of course he really doesn't try anything to make himself look good. But yes, some girls are shallow, but a lot of the time, if girl's are being this shallow, I don't think they're  looking for a committed relationship, just someone cute they can show they're friends.|`|RBM5yhK6aa	do you like a woman whose got a perfect hourglass shape and long gorgeous legs?? i bet you do..does that make you, as an individual, shallow??? <br>  <br>  stop thinking that only guys can have fun and 'admire' the beauty around them.<br>  <br>  girls like guys who have hot bodies. nothing wrong in that. it doesn't make them shallow. <br>  <br>  but yeah, muscular guys can be head turners.|`|t3XJC8dTaa	Heck no, well, I can't speak for all of us, but usually with muscular bodies comes arrogance. As long as you are a sweetheart and not flashing your body around, I think you will target good women. And they will show you the same affection.|`|hXehbPVqaa	hahaha<br>  funny question<br>  <br>  no women are not as shallow like guys judging girls bodies.<br>  girls do go for more personality cause most hot guys think they are hot and end up treating the girl like **** cause they think  they  can easilly get another girl..<br>  <br>  but girls like looking at hot bodies!<br>  thats simply it....<br>  <br>  me personally think big muscles are a turn off|`|EovfHDhnaa	yes. women are this shallow. if you wanted a girl who liked you for your personality, then there was no need to get ripped. you should've just stayed healthy.|`|1MmEXfriaa	Dude, I don't really understand which question are you really asking.|`|LhTipj6gaa	i think your a tosser.. quit d!ck sizing..|`|2QB90j85aa	ew|`|d3OaReBYaa	I find that guys who are really buff are wierd/creepy.

17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	you guys are in the 'friend' stage right now. you need to flirt with her a little bit so that you can see if she wants to take it further and date you. if she responds positively on more than one flirting occasion, then ask her out. if she rejects you, then she just wants to be friends.<br>  <br>  there's no set length of time before dating...it's just when it feels right and you feel a chemistry with someone that goes beyond friendship.
HHERTudVaa	just give him some space. things will work its way out. Dont worry. if its not meant to be it will play out.
EAwgYjYGaa	Speaking from personal experience (I'm currently engaged to a person I was in this exact situation with 10 years ago) you have to tell him immediately.  This is going to go one of two ways<br>  <br>  1.  You tell him how you feel he feels the same and you begin to date.<br>  <br>  2.  You tell him how you feel he doesn't feel the same and your friendship is over.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing to remember delaying this is only making things harder on yourself.  What if he liked you all along and than you graduate and never we're able to give the relationship a chance.  If he doesn't feel the same way, although it may seem like your world is coming to an end, it's actually a good thing as well because you're never going to be able to like someone else as long as you're caught up on him.  <br>  <br>  One last thing if he doesn't feel the same way you need to cut him out of your life.  If you try to keep him as your best friend you're going to be in a really bad situation.  It's the hardest thing to do but cutting a "best friend" out of your life gives the other person a chance to evaluate what you really mean to them.  If they have feelings for you and didn't realize it before they will realize really quickly.  If they don't have feelings for you than there are other people better suited to invest your energy in.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|29lCq98jaa	def 100% tell him<br>  literally ask ur self, are you gonna go for it<br>  or are you gonna let this other chick take over<br>  YOU can make it all change<br>  dont let it linger on do it now you might be suprised

R7q9BLuBaa	Hey Crazy girl, <br>  I can see you in the same situation that my GF was in about a year ago and I will tell you how everything turned out to be great! First of all, she has this rule that you can show some skin on the upper body or lower body, but never both. stilettos are a bit too much if you're gong out, wear some lower heels or maybe platforms with heels, no boots please even tough I like the way kne high boots look they will destroy the schoolgirl look. My Gf has some black leather shoes with platform in the botton, for me they are the best ones! you should start with some plain white or white with black stripes on the top thigh high socks, black ones area also ok. Have you taught into getting some Argyle pattern ones? the skirt doesn't have to be short!!! but it does have to be pladed preferably. get a skirt platted or something that is close to be schoolgirlishhh. at the top try different combination of shirts, pretty much whatever matches your skirt and socks. you MUST do your hair nicely, all other accesories are extra but don't put in too much of them. I'd like to know what kind of clothes/shoes/socks you have so I can better assist you. Things have worked out great for use and it can also work great for you two. mixing the right ingredients will get you where you want to stand. get back at me and maybe I can help you. <br>  -A friend|`|y9TvRvs6aa	I dunno why you want to do it in public. Go to a lingerie store, buy a school girl costume... head into the bathroom to 'slip into something comfortable', get dressed up.... when you're ready stand by the door and say something like 'I've been a bad, bad girl.'<br>  <br>  It just makes more sense - he is gonna get a hell of a lot more enjoyment if he can enjoy it in private.|`|fxuPCUyLaa	sounds like someone likes attention.

I still do that and I've been with my boyfriend for over two years. it's not that you don't trust him, it's just that you don't like not knowing. and if something bothers you, try to let it go, honestly try to hold it in as much as possible.|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	firstly your not a horrible girlfriend you just have some insecurities and secondly do you think he is cheating or do you think girls are always hitting on him? i guess you just ave to learn to trust your boyfriend!|`|vfJCYTGeaa	Well you know about that instinct thing right? maybe he is..but then maybe hes not.

1Q9D7pzAaa	Well it could be a date, or it could just be a hang out thing. What I would personally do is go and ask him if he thinks of me as more then a friend. But remember, be nice. Oh and don't not go, that would hurt his feelings, plus it has happened to me and I ended up miserable. I had actually only wanted to hang out with him.|`|wck4MHREaa	He kinda seems like he's up to something, especially considering that he is a natural flirt. The only thing to do, really, is to just go with him now. See if he does anything obvious, basically any flirting that would be considered an obvious sign that he likes you. If that's the case, take note of it, and (this is key) when you're absolutely, positively, 100% sure that he might be interested in you...then tell him that you don't feel the same way.|`|BjLFtVIjaa	haha first of all thats wierd that u have to wear black shoes..<br>  and u have never been on a date?? wow<br>  it sounds like one but u should still go... who knows it might be a surprise black shoes party... and if he has a gf then its prolly safe<br>  good luck lol<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgJckondr4OGGd60dMUQIcS.7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304203152AABaHU9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ibOsXpkraa	This sounds like a date,he gonna try to use you to get laid with you....just say that this is just a friend dinner and nothing else|`|ImnZzaRCaa	he sounds like a womanizer!|`|h3KZOnhcaa	Well I really dont know what to tell you.<br>  I think he would like to get to know you better but you say he flirts with all girls.& the "black shoes" is weird.Lol.Anyways.Well what if he thought that he likes you better than his GF??<br>  I say maybe you should go on this supposable date of his & just get to see more of him & if you like it. If you dont like it or him you can try to tell him in the nicest way so he wont get hurt.If you do like it then maybe you can continue going on dates?<br>  <br>  Well good luck & I hope my advice worked atleast a bit.[:|`|h31I5hSAaa	huh that wierd... just go and see what happens!|`|dTvdpGn6aa	why do you have to wear black shoes? <br>  first of all i think you should wear red shoes and see what happens haha. and yeah it sounds like a date, but its weird that he would do that when he has a girlfriend..

8fB5oh9jaa	it means that in most relationships between men and women there is a physical attraction by one party to the other. A relationship is sparked when the attraction is mutual, except out of desperation, and from there the persons will grow on each other. This will lead to a close friendship in which you know a lot about each other and everything about life in comforting. Love will then follow , at different rates for different couples. Remember that it is NOT dependent upon sex. You will know. But i believe that yes, love cannot exist without an initial attraction.|`|TPRQDf5waa	he's just saying that first impressions count. like not always but a lot of the time what attracts our interests in someone is the way they look. not saying they only care about your physical appearance but thats what gets a lot of people to notice others of the opposite sex. but after a while it becomes something more and deeper that has nothing to do with appearance.|`|qCgfcu6uaa	yes i do i believe in love at first site so i should so should everyone|`|AA10776535	There is no such thing as love at first sight...You can not love someone you don't know.

dY6HroZ3aa	They take place in a marriage hall, temple or in any large open places.<br>  <br>  A South Indian wedding comprises a number of customs and rituals.  As one enters the wedding venue one would notice plantain trees tied to the gateposts, overhead festoons of innumerable mango leaves, South Indian music, rangoli designs and many such exquisite features that characterize a South Indian wedding.<br>  <br>  On the eve of the wedding day the groom is escorted to the house of the bride by the parents of the latter. After reaching the venue prayers are offered to Lord Ganapati to keep all obstacles or hindrances at bay.  This is followed by gifting clothes to the bride and the groom. The wedding ceremonies start with the Vratham (prayer) that is observed separately by the groom and the bride.<br>  <br>  At the marriage venue the father of the groom and the bride formalize the marriage ceremony. The priest chants hymns.  The bride and the groom hold each other's hands and take seven steps around the holy fire solemnizing their marriage. This is an important part of the marriage ceremony and after they complete the seven rounds the marriage is considered to be finalized.<br>  <br>  While circling the fire they feed the fire God with firewood, ghee and twigs of specified trees. Next is a custom wherein the bride has to keep her foot on a grindstone which symbolizes her separation from the earlier way of living. The family and friends of the couple then shower rice grains on them. The wedding day celebrations come to an end with a sumptuous feast for the guests wherein traditional South Indian meals are served to the guests. The bride next has to take leave of her home and proceed towards her in-laws house where she is given a rousing welcome. There she, with her newly married husband gets ready to begin their conjugal life with the blessings and the best wishes of every one.<br>  <br>  This is a generalized process.  Again there are several different kinds of rituals which are followed and it depends upon the region/southern state which you hail from.|`|x0uuxxzUaa	They have many rituals to be performed.

The people are beautiful in my opinion- The girls have big round beautiful eyes. Anywho, I'm getting off subject. I have, unfortunately, not been to an Indian wedding, although I would love to. The friends that I know in India tell me that it's a wonderful celebration similar to the reception we have here in America. As far as the ceremony goes, churches do not really exist in India (if they do they are kind of hush hush) because of the big influence of Hinduism and Buddhism. So, they really just have the ceremony in whatever facility they can find as far as I understand it. This could be a tent set up in a field, a community gathering center or any other large are. I'm sorry, I do not have a link to give you for this information I'm just repeating what I have heard. <br>  If you are in the market for wedding accessories or anything you can check out a great website I have found: <a href="http://www.weddingenrichments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.weddingenrichments.com</a>
X3a0exwOaa	Try and borrow one of her rings, with out her noticing. Or one night if your watching telly or something just pretend to be goofy and try on one of her rings in front of her - and see (and remember) where it sits on your own fingers. Its easier to size up a ring rather than size down ... but its easy and inexpensive to do both really.|`|MGY48feraa	If you want to pick out a ring so you have something to give her when you propose, you can always check with the jeweller on their returns policy. Alot of them have between 14 - 30 days to return it in "as new' condition if she either doesn't like it or if it's too large/small to be sized to fit her. Then you're not stuck either way. Good luck!|`|Us8XGb3caa	you do not have to take her but the only thing is you do not know her size. but the good thing is once you surprise her and all if it dosent fit you can get it resizing so just go & pick it out yourself|`|KpxVsPZSaa	let her choose her ring. because if you choose the ring she may not like it. i choose my rings and my partner chose his ring. even though i knew he had the rings he proposed to me on my birthday last year.|`|3RCdVPsAaa	Don't take her..........Just get it and suprize her!

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why her sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in her situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator that you should suggest to her.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|IFd94XDkaa	No you are not crazy!  Sex should be fun at pretty much any age really.  Also, sex in a relationship is always very important.  Otherwise it really isn't a marriage is it?  I've been married 23 years and the frequency of sex has varied a lot over the years.  We even had a 6 month dry spell while his parents moved in with us a few years ago but you've got to try to overcome the problems you're having. <br>  <br>  Normally I'm not an Oprah fan but she did a great show awhile ago about sex and maybe your wife would listen to Oprah.  She can find info about the show at <a href="http://www.oprah.com/article/relationships/sex/pkgsex/20081113_tows_plan" rel="nofollow">http://www.oprah.com/article/relationshi...</a><br>  <br>  There were a couple of women on the show who didn't enjoy sex and they never had.  They got down to the root of the problem which was that these women had been taught that good girls didn't enjoy sex, didn't orgasm, etc.  One woman had been faking orgasms for 40 years!!  You guys would probably benefit from some couples counseling or sex therapy.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12272543	I would think that you would have some time for a few girlfriends and a fiance, or two.<br>  <br>  Marriage and sex are mutually exclusive.

03rggPF2aa	1. you should be able to get a part-time job at a spencers or hot topic type place with the ears.<br>  <br>  2. stay in school, but maybe try an adult education program instead. <br>  <br>  3. if youre mom is kicking you out then look for church groups/charities for ppl in the 18-24 yr old range that are aging out of the foster care system. tell them your story and they WILL take you in. you dont even have to be religious or anything. they will "see jesus in you" and help you out, no questions asked.<br>  <br>  i know, im not a guy, but ive been thru similar stuff. not the drugs or anything (altho my bf's sisters both went thru that) but i has to leave my home when i was 17 b/c my dads g/f attacked me, and he sided with her, so i had to go live with my bf, until a church group found a family to take me in. no rent or anything. so yea. i hope i helped. just calm down and dont stress. everything will work itself out.|`|AA10953999	Why the rush to get your diploma? I mean its not going to happen over night so why is your girlfriend threatening to leave? There are online classes you can take as well as classes geared towards people with learning disabilities. <br>  <br>  Go to a college counselor and ask them about it. As for your job, take anything you can get. there is no shame in working at a fast food place. A job is a job, try taping the inside of your ears closed with band aids or something.|`|vmn8hsb8aa	Okay, stop and take a deep breath...and let it out slowly. Repeat.<br>  Right, well, you say you're trying to turn your life around. Forgive me, but it also sounds like you are trying to make other excuses for not getting any further along. Dyslexia CAN be worked around, and your Mom and girlfriend might be willing to change their minds if you try to reach a reasonable compromise with them. Talk to any counselors at school for ideas and suggestions. Try asking your girlfriend if she'd be willing to work with you on your reading and studying rather than just giving you an ultimatum/deadline. If she won't help you get your diploma, she doesn't sound like much of a girlfriend to me.<br>  Same thing with your Mom. Have you been contributing anything to the household expenses, or just living off  the parent(s)? Are you working at all right now? See if she'd be willing to work out a rent arrangement based on what you presently make. If you aren't making any money, maybe she'd be willing to exchange a schedule of housework for actual cash rent until you can get a part-time job. Use a reasonable tone, no shouting. If she won't change her mind, ask any relatives who live nearby, then talk to any friends who might be willing to work something out.<br>  As for your ears...can't help you there. You made a choice and you have to live with the results.  I do wish you luck for your future, just remember that going back to drugs won't help. stay clean and be well.|`|43y0iwSdaa	Well u can't spell. But yeah I have nothing good to say but that I'm a 15.

Start with one problem which would be school. Don't think about any problems this entails, just get on top of this and move on to problem number two etc. I used to be involved with gangs and drugs a lot and am getting on top of my life, however it takes time and I make mistakes every day. Try church. If you don't fancy getting into Christs family at least tell your local youth group or high school group that your in trouble and wouldn't mind a spiritual kick in the butt to get you started. If you have trouble reading try 7th grade books with some harder ones splashed in for a challenge. Final advice NEVER GIVE UP!!!!! I used to think my life was screwed but I look at you and go what the hell was I thinking, so im about to go to jail, so what if i spend half my life trying to bash the crap out of strangers for my money, at least im over that. I didn't give up and now im getting postives in my life. NEVER GIVE UP!

As far as your health goes, you do what you have to do.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	My husband went through the exact same situation.  We chose to wait.  There is something magical about having all of your friends and family there and your husband to be seeing you in the dress.  If you are already married it just seems like that spark and excitement isn't there.  It is like you are putting on a show instead of getting married.  Talk to your dentist and see if you can get a temporary fix.  They may be able to give you a temporary crown until your wedding depending on what your tooth issue is.  Good luck hun!
O1MITmaGaa	I don't like this idea of choosing between one or the other. I can understand why you all 3 can't live together, but why not just have you all separate? Why?<br>  <br>  1. if you choose one, how can you be friends with the other? will the other hate you for picking the other person?<br>  2. by separating, you can keep on friendly terms with both and not have to sacrifice one for the other<br>  <br>  If you can choose one and somehow maintain friendships with both, I'd say just go for the one who you live best with, who you're most comfortable with, who you can trust more. If not, then which do you just plain like better and get along with better and feel wouldn't have trouble with payments?<br>  <br>  good luck

TDiRmT9daa	People need to BELONG. It is a very primal need.<br>  <br>  What will make the difference for you is this: will he feel the need to belong to YOU or will he feel the need to belong to THEM. And that will be a measure of his character and integrity.<br>  <br>  If his co-workers can convince him that they are "US", then you will become "THEM". If he is a man of character and integrity, he won't buy that crap. He will know that jobs come and go but YOU are US  by sacred union - because he made promises for life to you at the altar, not to whatever co-workers may cross his path.<br>  <br>  You have an amazing opportunity to find out if you married a leader or a follower here. Sometimes it is hard to hear the answer to the question in our hearts and minds but you won't know until you know. <br>  <br>  My point is: here is a tough, maybe painful way for you to find out the truth about the man you married. If he is a leader, it will show. If he is a sheep, it will show even more starkly. So, which horse do you bet on? Do you go "all in" on your husband's character and integrity or do you bet against him? And if you would ever bet against him, why did you marry him? There is no room for DOUBT in COMMITMENT.<br>  <br>  My point is: Marriage is COMMITMENT. It is a YES or NO proposition. You are either "ALL IN" or you don't play. If your husband is a MAN he will be a MAN no matter who or what is at the table. Is he a man of character and integrity that you would bet your life on him? And if he isn't, are you too suspicious and jaded to know character and integrity when it barks in your face or does he truly lack the qualities of a leader and act like a sheep?<br>  <br>  I can't answer those questions but you can.|`|FaLO77Mkaa	Depends if you husband has enough will power. <br>  <br>  But I duno, they say you are who you hang out with..|`|24858b655af419324c43251eb8993fd9aa	Be careful and if he starts showing signs of this, get rid of him. you'll only be miserable.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	Well, you can't really control the situation. The most you can do is ask him to quit. If he is cheater he will cheat if has outside influences or not.|`|AA11391968	There may be alot of good things with some of these men that you are unaware of.  Your husband might enjoy his c-workers.  This is not something that rubs off onto a grown person.  It is a way of life they have learned and/or taught over many years.  Your husband is his own person who does his own thing, regardless.  Don't let it bother you.  It's better than him working 12 hours a day working with nothing but women.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Do you honestly believe that your husband (how old is he, by the way?) is that naive that he can be that easily swayed by the bad behavior of his co-workers?  It takes someone with no clear sense of himself and no sense of responsibility to be that influenced by his co-workers.  If your husband has a good, solid character, what they do won't influence him.  And keep in mind..... if he ever does decide to cheat, that will not be his co-workers' responsibility.  It will have been his lousy choice.|`|oDMEYSKjaa	Something like that, I don't think will rub off on him. If he loves you tremendously, then you shouldn't worry about it. <br>  My husband works in the military, and he always hears about men cheating, he has no respect for the men who do that. He hates it when people cheat. Why get married if your going to cheat? he always asks. I have told him how I felt, and he laughs at me and reassures me that he's never going to do something like that. He loves me so much.|`|GVVoTtp8aa	Um i was in the same situation.

Talk to her about it in a nice way. But to be honest, if she doesnt change her ways, you shouldn't deal with that. There is NOTHING more important than school and education. Being on time and learning should always take precedence, if she cant understand that, she is not a true friend. And she wants you to be late with her, because people cant stand to be alone and in trouble.

Besides it might actually help her to be a little more on time.|`|g3Dn1UqIaa	well it seems to me like your friend is kind of needy and slightly tempermental (no disrespect intended) but you kinda dont deserve to be yelled at by a friend for wanting to do well in school and be on time maybe you just need to tell her that school is a priority for you and that you dont intend to hurt her but to maybe get ready sooner or talk to teacherss before class so you dont end up waiting on her and being late or leaving her and hurting her feelings. i mean if she truly is your friend she shouldnt be making you cry especially over something as silly as this just talk to her about it and tell her how she is hurting YOU and try to find some sort of compromise|`|q1lftomoaa	Just tell her that you are not going to get bad grades for always being late to class just because she is thinking that you are "ditching" her when you really aren't you are just doing what you are supposed to do by not waiting on slow pokes like her to drag around like a turtle and wait until the last minute to get her books and then wind up being late to class!!!!!!!!! I had the same thing happen to me and I know what you mean. I hate it when friends get all sensitive and they think that you are trying to ditch them or leave them when all you are doing is taking good  care of yourself and keeping up your grades. so tell her that. well not so mean like i wrote it but tell her something like that.
yHFnScgiaa	You will never forget what they did. My husband did a lot of stupid things a couple months before we got married and we are still together and have been married for over a year now. He never fully cheated but he walked along that line.  People can do stupid things before they get married because they are scared. My husband was a drinker than and his buddies didn’t want him getting married. They had him get wasted and then have him sign on to online sites and flirt with other women or call girls on his phone. I found out after I got married and we separated. He stopped drinking and lost all the bad influence friends and really took responsibility for his actions. We got back together and he hasn’t done anything since. But I never fully can trust him because my heart just isn’t ready. My best advice for you is, live your life with how he is acting today. The past will always be there and you can’t do anything about it but you can pick how your future will be. You love him clearly then live off that. When your brain starts thinking about all the hurtful things he has done STOP! Turn your attention to something else. I have put my husband through hell for the year we have been back together because how heartbroken I am and it isn’t worth it. You need to take time into making yourself okay! You cannot predict what people are going to do but you can help protect yourself. If you believe in yourself and make yourself strong then it won’t matter what he does because you will always be okay. Living your life fearing what he is going to do with only make you miserable and your relationship, trust me...I learned the hard way. Give him the rope..see if he hangs himself if he doesn’t then every time you see how he has changed will help heal the broken heart =)|`|pkFkP8g3aa	Go to counciling and have trust or breakup ....u may always resent him an live miserable|`|42A0cw0Faa	Well you have to think about what he did.. then you have to realize if you can't get over it you probably won't so take some time and think about it. Is the heart ache worth the problem?
6tn8DJajaa	haha, no man dont grab her... a couple ways to initiate casual body contact are: your hand on the small of her back as you both head somewhere, tucking her tag in her shirt, even when its not out!  pretend there is an eyelash on her cheek and get it for her, tell her it is there first of course..... touch her arm when you talk to her, comment on how large her hands are or tiny, and compare them to yours ( if they are large, it will show that u arent afraid to joke with her)<br>  <br>  spill some hydrochloric acid on her, and help her remove her clothes?? lol|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Listen to yeventryuwilllose he/she's got it covered lol.|`|K7SFaYEHaa	keep an open palm,it shows your interested,but not greedy|`|pkFkP8g3aa	Put your junk on her forehead girls love that sh*#|`|IdCLOFRFaa	Brush against her when you're reaching for something (like, you could have it in easy reach, but instead you decide to go the difficult route in order to brush against her) and no...that doesn't mean graze her boob or butt or anything like that, that just conveys that you want her physically, which I hope isn't the only goal. <br>  <br>  Just small little things here and there will show her you care, like, if you're trying to get past her, you could touch her arm, or shoulder and be like "excuse me" and then slide past her. <br>  <br>  You don't want to just randomly touch her...that's annoying, but at the same time...you kind of want it to be obvious...meaning that you should touch her when it isn't particularly necessary (such as the whole reaching thing mentioned above)<br>  <br>  When she hands you something, or vice versa...you can leave contact with your hands just a second longer than necessary and make quick eye contact. Just be subtle and polite about it. If she reacts negatively with her body language (aka turns away from you or flinches), I would start to back off a bit. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	wink at her, slap her ***, poke the side of her stomach(extremely ticklish to those who are.. ticklish) - but so she knows these are jokes of course.<br>  (but of course you're not really joking..) she will laugh. you will laugh. it will go back and forth. and then eventually you'll go to poke her and she'll put her hand out to stop you but you grab her hand and then there is that moment that you both realise what you're doing.|`|0YBBz4olaa	I'll be the one who says grab her... lol... when she's not expecting anything... grab her crotch... ok... now that that's out of the way, more serious...<br>  <br>  You can just ask "can I feel your hair?" She'll probably say "Why?" with a confused look. just say you just want to... If your feeling a little down some day, ask for a hug.|`|FBzdlncBaa	A quick touch on the shoulder when you laugh, when she says something funny.<br>  <br>  Or "you hair is so nice, but is it real?", she will say "Yeah, feel it".|`|42A0cw0Faa	Okay if it were me... Just grab me and hug me or something dramatic but not completely earth shattering...|`|dPicgCgwaa	play with her hair, some girls like that (given that shes comfortable with you)|`|6UTuaJaJaa	ask her out|`|N7mgfDxnaa	like if a guy says i have lint on the back of my shirt, so he'll like stand in front of me and reach over my shoulder, and then he'll touch my neck with a super soft area. or ask for like a whatsup handshake, but don't let go of her hand for a bit. just put your arm around her, you can write something on a piece of paper and try putting it in her back pocket.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	why don't you ask her out for a drink or dinner?  it's almost st. patrick's day so you have an excuse right there.......or pretend she has an eyelash on her face and say oh you have an eyelash and pretend to lightly take it off her cheek or wisk it away.....me personally, i would prefer a guy to be upfront and just be like hey wanna grab a bite or a drink after work?  see what she says you'll never know unless you ask.......good luck!! let me know if it works out i love this stuff hahah summerwind07044@aol.com write it down and don't forget !!  LOL  =p
QBFbvO21aa	He is insecure sillybutt! <br>  I am sorry but if he asks this constantly, <br>  he needs that constant satisfaction, meaning he isnt secure.<br>  Either its that, orrrrrrr he is ULTRA sensitive. <br>  Thinks it's his own way of sharing love and a bond with you two.<br>  It's sweet at first, but...OMG we get the point after awile. lol.<br>  Im sure he is a great guy, just tell him these things, and from the looks of it..i think he just wants to make sure you are happy :]<br>  <br>  orrrrrrr maybe he is hiding something from you, and is asking you these things becuase he is scared. hmm.|`|AA11391968	It's funny because people complain if they do not hear this from their loved one.  I say just let him sing his joy to you.|`|zka26204aa	Whether you want to admit it or not, he is acting a bit insecure.|`|WN7L93jpaa	Maybe there is something that you are doing or stopped doing that is making him want to hear you reminding him how much you love him. At least he's is asking you instead of taking a different attitude.<br>  <br>  Take for example women when are trying to fish for complements when they ask "how do I look?" even when they know they did their best to look good.<br>  <br>  He knows you love him but he wants you to tell him. Or maybe he wants you to show him. For example my husband and I have different ways of showing affection. So we try to show love to each other in a way the other will understand.<br>  <br>  I don't know a lot. But this is all I can tell you.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  =)|`|a1ea2bfa58bf3e14718b966b8099eab5aa	hahaha you just said your boyfriend is annoying and your still with him? whats wrong with you..he is obviously too jealous and too weird..why be with him? dump him.. how old are you? 12? dont act like a baby ..you can make your own choices and if your boyfriend annoys you that much just dump him!|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	It would bug the hell out of me too, and despite what you claim, he sounds extremely insecure about the relationship (he may not be insecure about other areas of life)....so why do you claim he isn't?|`|VS78dqO9aa	He's obviously just one of those annoying types of people.... It's wierd but God blessed many of people with that attribute...<br>  <br>  Just talk to him again....|`|EsRuOno1aa	I think that your boyfriend may be on the insecure side and he needs constant reassurance. He might have doubts about your feeling toward him and that why he has to ask all the time, just to make sure that you love and miss him. I dated someone like that and I hated it. If it bothers you so much then you should probably let him know that and let him know that you do love and miss him and all that, so he doesn't need to keep asking you all the time. He should just know and stop questioning you or your feeling about him.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Man, that would be annoying. He has this impulse, and does it without thinking. You need to tell him upfront, and tell him that it isn't necessary for him to do that. It's his insecurities that are getting in the way of his social behavior. He can't help it, but if it bothers you it isn't fair to put up with that...GL|`|qfZdj9J8aa	it probably has to do with his mom. i did that to my ex girl friend, but i broke up with her because "she used to call me all the time" and be like that, but when i did it, all of a sudden it was annoying????? it hurt me to feel that way. i brok up with her after she made me feel as though i was bugging her. i still remember her yelling at me, saying "what!!! what do you want!!! why did you call me soo much" i was like because i wanted to talk to you.. i missed you" she was like damn do you have to call soo much. after that i was in a hurry to  forget her. i never felt so hurt in my life. some times i wish we never met. she was a Model. who cares though. it is the heart that matters. prove to him you love him. look him square in the eye and say i love you every time you guys are together. i omost gave my virginity to her. now i'm glad i didn't. i wish i had an understanding girl friend sigh|`|3B1g8cVBaa	Tell him straight up that it annoys you. You'll probably have to do this several times as he won't get it right away.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	You can just dump him and come date me.|`|7Fc22teCaa	Kick his *** until he runs home bawling to his momma, then find a real BF.|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	just be straight up with him tell him.<br>  <br>  and atleast you know he loves you and you are all he ever thinks about,|`|N7gOE1btaa	You said that your boyfriend isn't insecure, well I tend to think he is.  He may not be insecure about your relationship or your feelings, but he may be insecure about something in his life.  Maybe he hasn't achieved some goal, or lost a job, or doesn't feel good enough about himself.  You are his girlfriend and likely therefore his greatest source of comfort.  The next time he does this, try not to get upset, and try not to answer his question.  Instead, ask him why is it that he keeps asking, then gently try to ask him questions about things that may be bothering him.  If you get to the source of it, then let him know you still love him, always will, and together the two of you will work through his problem because you will always support him no matter what.|`|CxhH2xSQaa	I am not saying this to be a bi*** but have you thought about the option that maybe he is cheating/being a total ahole and that might be why he's so insecure or asking so many times if you still love him?<br>  <br>  I know it sounds weird...but it is something that might stir up so many calls and questions.<br>  <br>  If you know that's not it then you might need to take a break from him or break up...if you are confident and secure you need to be with someone who is as well, and he obviously is not and that is sucking the life out of your relationship and, unless he gets his shi* together, you will end up leaving or he will leave for some lame-o girl and you will be like "WTF he left me for THAT"...but only because she makes him feel more important....<br>  <br>  anyway, i only mentioned the cheating thing cus maybe you haven't thought of it...not to be mean...hope you figure it out.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	ur man is annoying he is also insecure and needs the full reenforement and approvall from u. this is a problem that will not get fixed on its own, it will maybe only get addressed hopefully fixed with medicine or counciling on his part. he has issues. it sounds like ur fed up and r tied of the **** cause it wares u out emotionally, and drains u. good luck. get help now or it will only get worse.|`|kbdx5847aa	have you told him or asked him the same question you ask us? talk to him and say be more confident in our relationship because I love you and we have been together this long, if I did not care we would not be together. Simply trust what we have because " I love you but its annoying to hear you ask that all the time!"|`|n41yoBzFaa	I guess it all comes down to whether you are in love with him or not. If you love him, talk to him about it. But if you don't have as many feelings for him anymore, do what's best for you and end it. I think he might actually be a but obsessed and that's not okay in a relationship so just be honest with him and let him know how you feel.|`|AKkfepINaa	Sometimes guys act this way if something has gone wrong either with his childhood, like something happened with his parents relationship or maybe his past relationship to make him act this way so maybe get to the bottom by asking some questions. U should tell him that it bothers you that he asks these things all the time and try to figure out why.If you guys don't talk it will get worse. Maybe he hasn't had a previous relationship so he is freaking out about this one. You just have to get to the root of what's going on... Good luck to you both!|`|4DKT06TLaa	if he isn't insecure, then he is a girly guy. girly guys are usually dramatic and possess a lot of feminine quality. it depends on the person. but most girls dont like girly girly guys b/c they are very similar to them, instead girls look for security, power, money and reliability, which are lacked by girly guys. <br>  <br>  its up to you, i by no means want you to break up ur relationship and if you can stand 3 years then... dayum<br>  just do what you can, ask your friends how they think of ur bf|`|lJjrfgJdaa	Uh ya I have the exact same problem, just try to get to the point where you actually miss him too. And maybe sometimes tell him you're being a little too clingy and not even giving me time to miss you so how can I? And if he doesn't get the hint then maybe you shouldn't be dating him.|`|16abellKaa	I think he actually might be insecure, but it's something to talk to him about. Simply just ask, in a calm and even cute tone, "I love you too, but I'm curious; why is it that you ask me so much if I love you?" see what he says...|`|vVO7Xlauaa	My boyfriend was kinda like that, sometimes I would just not answer the phone, and then just call him back later, and make an excuse for not answering. He was really good about it. But he has passed away now, and I really do miss him.|`|B6Bbr2Nvaa	Your boyfriend is still insecure in the relationship. He has no trust, or  <br>   perhaps he is worried because of something he did.|`|5f1LDTdKaa	Before Selecting anything we should be careful once u own that u cant do any thing but in ur case he hasn't enter into ur life yet so dont worry now u have a chance to re think take nice decison which will make u fell happy bye .....|`|K7SFaYEHaa	tell him his girly like gestures are turning you gay|`|atCDl9gbaa	Tell him to lay low. He should understand. Or tell him ur busy and that u cant be talkin as much as usual
F5eKBBaXaa	Good body. That's why there's a thing called trash bag. It's meant for the head.|`|Q06InngZaa	OMG, i have totally been thinking about this lately. I think men would rather have a good body...as for me...you must be attractive!!|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Good looks. Or do you mean like a good looking person who is extremely obese? Because in that case its good body lol.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	No the good person and careful for humen just see personality|`|a1ea2bfa58bf3e14718b966b8099eab5aa	thats a hard one...but i would probably choose body...face could be pretty but they could be not so in shape..i love nice bodies...bodies are the best..|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Goodlooks|`|AA11122150	argh.... so hard to decide.

2o3BHgCCaa	I didn't want to include all the addresses of reception and ceremony, recommended hotels, transportation, dress code, registry, directions, OOTers things to do etc. in the invitation. I put all this stuff in the website and included the website details on a card with the invitation. Much less bulk to send and instead of getting heaps of calls all the info is laid out for them.<br>  <br>  It is relatively casual with some things about us and then all the required information.|`|nqINitkmaa	I am having a destination wedding. I included on my website our proposal story, a few pictures of us, some pictures and descriptions of everyone in the bridal party, information and links to the vineyard we are getting married at, hotel, and airline information. There is also a link to our wedding registry. We also have pictures of our new home that we will be sharing together. Theres a guest book as well that guests sign. Its fun!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	I'm confused, too, hon. Don't feel bad !!<br>  <br>  Websites, wedding programs, themes ... I'm tellin' ya, sometimes I think the entire wedding industry does nothing but think of more ways to suck our money.<br>  <br>  Like we don't have enough to already do, without adding, at 1am when you're dead tired "omG I forgot to update the website today."<br>  <br>  Maybe it's me, but sometimes the information age all boils down to too much information.

EhAiyJmHaa	this is horrible!  so because she is away, she had to miss the burial?  i see how this is difficult for you, but unfortunately there is no easy way or best way to do this.... Since you have no clue where your friend is, you will more than likely have to wait for her to return... Is she not gonna try and contact family such as her parents before her return?  Maybe she will call you|`|9KEBtsNTaa	Have you considered telling her uncle and having him tell her?  The death of ones parents should probably be told by a family member in person, not over the phone.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Don't hold the information back from your friend. Let her know be honest and be her friend in her time of need. God Bless the both of you!!|`|vh0zDsyTaa	Do u have her email address??|`|d51rpXduaa	Well something similar happened to me and my nanna while we were overseas and my nannas mum died. Okay so its a lil expected at the age she was but its a long story.<br>  <br>  Anyway, wait till she comes back from America. You dont want to ruin her time there even if it is something so very very important. Pick her up from the airport, take her home (or whatever) and then tell her, so she has some privacy while she falls apart...as horrible as it seems. It was the best way for us to find out... Just be there for her, thats all you can do :(<br>  <br>  P.S I think the guy above me has a good point too!|`|6oxRJwZWaa	That's terrible. <br>  My advice let her enjoy the the rest of her vacation. There is no easy way to do this. Yes she will be devastated Yes she will cry and Yes she is bound for tough times. what you have to do is when she gets back break it to her gently. This type of thing is hard on any one be the shoulder for her to cry on. STAY WITH HER, people have tendency to act irrationally during times of grief be her voice of sanity it may be tough now but you'll be glad you helped her through this difficult time and she will be grateful to. again very sorry for your friends loss i hope this helped.|`|AA11136495	Wait till she comes back, it would be best to tell her in person to be there for her when she needs somebody to lean on.=]|`|Qjl6b0ynaa	ma'am im chris hansen why dont you have a seat over here...|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	That is awful my prayer are with you, and her. There isn't going yo be a perfect time make sure that she has someone with her.|`|zka26204aa	Just tell her that there is an emergency situation and she needs to call you immediately.  Tell her it is regarding her parents.  Then you can talk to her in person.
Q06InngZaa	ha....were just about the same size. I sent a photo of my self to someone for a job recently and the lady thought I was a size 8!! I almost died laughing! (must have been a good pic!) Quick question, do you think of yourself as fat or just thick. I think I'm just thick, but I tend to suffer from over confidence. lol,  I'm just curious what other women my size think.<br>  <br>  and about your question...I wouldn't say...I NEVER tell anyone how much I way. Like someone else said, it's only a number!|`|ba7ca3404efdda930e5ae6442f75c95caa	Tell him cause you dont want it to turn out like that scene in the movie "Friday" where smokey meets that one girl who says she looks like Janet Jackson and she gets out the car looking more like Freddy Jackson! But from what you describe you seem to have all the phat in the right places cause if your 190 lbs and a size 14 that means you you thicky thick but in a good way!|`|cJooDZpnaa	I wouldnt tell him how much you weigh, cause that sounds weird. I would just show him a few photos of what you're body really looks like and see if he still likes you. But maybe he is not shallow and likes you even if you are a bit chubby.|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	No. Why should you tell him? If you must tell him minus a few pounds (like 30). I don't think u should tell him though. It's not important.|`|59HXAtRHaa	NO!!  coz a girl NEVER reveals her WEIGHT!!!|`|ded67a0b2e7e52c2691947fb4e226735aa	Why keep it a secret, he will soon find out anyway. From what you know of him, do you think your weight is important to how he sees you? Anyway, if i were you, i will tell him. If he does not want you anymore, he is shallow person, better not to waste any more time with him. If it is ok with him, then maybe he really is someone worth meeting and loving.|`|b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	Just go with the flow girl. If you've given him full body photos, that haven't been slimmed up with photoshop (hey I know, I done it to my own before, ha), then he knows how you look. If he likes what he sees, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Most guys can't guess weight anyway because so many women lie about it.|`|95s0Dlg9aa	NOPE! The best thing about being online is that you can be whoever you want to be. No matter how creepy that sounds. You'll prob never meet him in person. So don't your lower self esteem, by telling your weight if your super uncomfortable with it. Unless there's webcam. Then i'd tell the truth.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Don't ever tell a man how much you weigh!!!  Especially if he doesn't ask.<br>  <br>  If he has seen your pics, then I am sure he is good with you as is.<br>  <br>  Cameras usually make a person look heavier anyways..<br>  <br>  So, he might be pleasantly surprised when he sees you.|`|Dfeemjagaa	a woman never tells her age, weight or hair color. you need to love yourself more. your weight should not matter so much. self confidence hides the weight better than clothes. so just be happy and let it go, ok?|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Yeah you are just fine be yourself|`|DTN6Vg8caa	its upto to him to chose tel him|`|AA11716381	Ahh I wish I weighed 190lbs lol! Size 14... miss those days.<br>  <br>  You know, a size 14 isn't really a bad size. Tell him if you like, I'm sure if he's seen full body pics he has an idea of what you weigh.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind not to be fake or hide anything because if you do he may be upset when you meet in person. Also, if you're honest, you'll know he likes you for who you are and you won't have to worry so much.|`|AKkfepINaa	If you showed him pics of you then he should see how much you weigh but you should never lie about it. That is not a good way to start out a relationship and if he liked you it wont matter to him. You should find someone that likes you for your inner and outer beauty and it wont matter about weight or little things like that. If he doesn't talk to you anymore find someone that is worth your time! Your beautiful always remember that!|`|Kpg5i1LUaa	Well, if you don't want to then just don't bring it up, but if he asks and wants to know, I suggest being honest and tell him the truth, especially if you don't look your weight and he likes the way you look now.|`|T8x9xKXBaa	If he knows what you look like, why do you need to tell him what you weigh? Has he point-blank asked you?<br>  If not, why bring it up?|`|cwEO2tGtaa	well i think if he has seen pictures of you and there recent it should matter your weight cuz no girl likes saying how much they weigh.|`|97krYyP1aa	i wouldnt tell him ...only if he wanted to know...how much is 190 pounds anyway...its not that much is it....i live in australia and weigh 51 kg so yeh i have no idea lol|`|x1FzJLwZaa	be honest, he would find out the truth sooner or later when he sees you in person|`|CRMAyEBqaa	might as well tell him..save him finding out when he gets there. If he likes you it shouldnt matter.|`|jHsd5Z98aa	If he knows what you look like, weight doesn't matter. It's just a number.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	yes.|`|KhoTIIhvaa	u have to be honest to him..|`|m8BJXUKwaa	yes dont be mean|`|a6rHIO5taa	if you are actually "in love" then he shouldn't mind. but remember relationships raised on lies never last. <br>  Tell him.|`|8vshPwOPaa	ok...you dont have to TELL him you weigh 190 pounds. but!<br>  <br>  you DO definitely need to send him a picture of you in a some one smaller t-shirt in a full body length photo.<br>  <br>  i dont mean SUPER TIGHT tshirt but at least let him know what he should be expecting.<br>  <br>  obviously you aren't one of those girls that's in denial about your weight which is good. at least you know who you are.<br>  <br>  but keeping it from this guy could blow up in your face.<br>  <br>  you're obviously expecting something romantic to happen and if he expects to find someone he isn't going to meet thennnn that could be really, really awkward for him and then you'll feel weird too cause he feels weird and it'll be a big uncomfortable mess.<br>  <br>  make sure he KNOWS who he's meeting. he's gonna find out one way or another. at least this way if you let him see the real you, you can take comfort in knowing there's a chance of somthing real happening (which not a lot of ppl get)|`|xv7YlV29aa	no honey you don't need to tell him your weight. He has seen tons of pictures of you as you said and thinks you are pretty.<br>  <br>  besides when guys here numbers they automatically think something big and that is not true. Someone can be 250 and not be that fat at all. My best friend is around there and is not big. SOmetimes you weigh more if you have lots of muscle. So a number really makes no difference. As long as he has seen your picture.<br>  <br>  <br>  funny i was in a online thing before but im in florida and he is in new york lol. but i never had the guts to send him my picture and he did not either. sometimes its better that way.|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	You don't have to tell him your real weight.  Tell him something like, you're less than a ......barrel of water (that's bad, think of something else), but more than ....... fill in the blank.<br>  <br>  He doesn't need to know right now.
DvwJmahvaa	awwww , you sound like a sweetheart<br>  <br>  dont worry, im sure many girls will love you|`|03rggPF2aa	personally, i like geeky guys, sports will only get you so far in life. women want a stable man. try playing the sympathy card. women love to take care of their man. it will work.|`|bbMi6Fknaa	LOL omg, this made me laugh so hard.<br>  <br>  "omg, i hate you get out of my life, you cant even ride a bike! your worthless"<br>  <br>  HAHAH|`|42A0cw0Faa	Calm down find what you are good at... Stop looking at what you aren't. Okay?|`|PU0wfROvaa	Who rides a bike these days? Walking is much better in my opinion, as you can talk to a girl while you're heading to your destination.<br>  <br>  The whole, girls go for jocks thing is completely stereotypical. I'm a bookworm and girls still go for me (most likely to help with their homework, but they go for me, essentially).<br>  <br>  Just build up your speaking skills. If you have looks, another bonus.|`|XqzH0l0Maa	this question seems alittle suspect to me. are you serious? if you are, stop being so down on yourself. once you do, they will flock to you. be yourself.|`|okolAkV8aa	ok i no this harsh but most girls sorta do care about looks but also wats inside so i say see if she really likes u<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol gl|`|6UTuaJaJaa	real girls do not care if guys can't do something.|`|28d6298071cd55e7d2a470d15a36f442aa	wow.<br>  use some grammar for once.|`|hXehbPVqaa	no we dont care|`|DwiQ66qyaa	nope...i'm not too much into bike riding anymore...maybe when i was like 10<br>  <br>  <br>  I like a guy who can drive a nice car:D<br>  <br>  but seriously...have more self confidence...<br>  <br>  stop thinking about what you can't do... the best way to get a girl is <br>  1) get her attention <br>  2) make her smile. Give her extraordinary compliment (you're the smartest girl in the world, even if she knows she isn't, she'll laugh and like it)<br>  3) make a move<br>  4) stop contactin her so much...this will make her chase you a bit<br>  5) do something about it<br>  <br>  6)Eat fruits and vegetables. Walk if you can't do too much sports.

I don't even know how you would define a jock. it's just a stereotype, you know? jock boys aren't anything special. so they can throw a football, yippee. that doesn't make them elitists. I like gawky, wow-playing, intellectually sparked men myself. <br>  <br>  third, when it comes to jokes, it's not everything. im sure if you went out with a girl and you were just being cute, she'd giggle at you, just because of how goddam adorable you are. you don't even have to be all that funny. girls will just laugh because they're happy or excited. at least, that's how I am anyway. no puns though. unless it's absolutely called for in a way that will make someone laugh because it's so bad. like "one day I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now he's gone." omfgroflmaololbbq. <br>  <br>  that's all i got for you <3 good luck babe|`|HcUaPolEaa	That doesn't matter to a girl.<br>  <br>  Who you are inside is all that matters.<br>  =/|`|JMIKVR5waa	No I don't even ride bikes.|`|cVhuFVWSaa	Just be yourself and relax.

You do have some good ideas. If she is all alone i am sure she would be delighted if someone invited her to join in. she seems very shy and you will probably have to make the first move so go in gently next time you do group work go over to her introduce yourself and ask if she is already in a group if not ask "why not come join ours". for the first part you are going to have to much of the work introduce her to your friends get her to open up eventually all your friends will catch on. I think it is great that you are willing to do this for that girl i bet she will really thank you for it.

onbwN4csaa	Cold feet are completely normal. Don't second guess yourself You have always felt confidant in your love and commitment for him and you have always trusted his  commitment to you. granted your scared you should be. But with you confidence in your relationship that you have shown and said in everyone of you Q and As shows that you are aware of what your doing. You have done the research.<br>  Have your faith in each other that you both will do the right thing to work together to over come any obstacle and nothing else matters but you as man and wife.<br>  <br>  I sure you may have done this a few times but do it a few more times.<br>  Wright the word    Mrs.  in front of your name and when you do it. be thinking of his face and you both doing something together that was the most fun.<br>  I'm sure your feet will become warm again.<br>  Good luck.|`|EI7QLonBaa	i think every bride to be at one point or another has cold feet. (so do the grooms to be) just think long and hard. if you've made it this far - then it's safe to say that your following your heart.

Everything will be fine :) if you start questioning everything - including your guy.... then you may miss the opportunity of a lifetime.|`|i5WCmJRWaa	I had the same thing going on before getting married.

Just dotn say the wrong things.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I think that as the others have said, it is normal. I am getting married to a wonderful guy very soon and I know I love him and he loves me and he is honest and worries about me and trusts me and I trust him but like you said, sometimes I think about it or someone will say something about the plans or I will look at the ring and think OMG what am I doing? LOL! So this will be #2 for me, the first one was a BAD relationship that should have never gone as far as it did and I know that this one is good...Just reassure yourself that he is the one, you love him and what you are going through is normal and I would tell him and I bet he is going through the same thing and as another poster said if you weren't worried and getting jittery and cold feet then I would be worried. Everything will be fine and congratulations!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	If you didn't have cold feet, then I'd worry. It means that you're not taking it lightly, and that you're using your good sense to make positive double sure you're making the right decision.<br>  <br>  Let it go, and stay focused on what's positive about everything, and don't tell your man about it. He's probably got his own cold feet happening over there as well (it's perfectly normal !), but to add to his nervousness by telling him about your own won't make him feel any better. Think about what a wonderful future you'll have, what a great dad he's gonnabe, how much you want to be his wife and all the other things that are good about this time in your life. <br>  <br>  Focus your energy on what's positive, and your fears will fade away.<br>  <br>  Congrats, and best of luck !!

Mete tu dedo, una vez adentro, muévelo hacia la pared de adelante (la que da a la panza), allí te encontrarás con algo que sobresale un poco, que no es igual al resto, ése el el punto G.

Es una masa compuesta por nervios, situada a dos o tres pulgadas de la entrada de la vagina, y de forma parecida a un fríjol. Su tama?o es, aproximadamente, el de una moneda mediana, aunque su localización y dimensión, pueden variar entre una mujer y otra.<br>  <br>  Descubrir el Punto G, sin embargo, no es una tarea fácil, por lo que algunas mujeres llegan a creer que no lo poseen. Aquellas que sí lo han encontrado, dicen disfrutar mucho la posición de “perrito” durante el acto sexual, ya que le permite al pene del hombre, un mejor acceso a la pared del frente de la vagina, donde se encuentre dicho punto. Una presión firme, un ritmo rápido y mucha fricción, facilitarán el logro del orgasmo del Punto G. Es curioso cómo muchas mujeres, sienten una sensación parecida al deseo de orinar, cuando se comienza a estimular el punto, por lo que te recomendamos ir al ba?o antes de comenzar a hacer el amor. Es posible, además, que eyacules una peque?a cantidad de un líquido blanco o transparente, cuando llegues al clímax. Tal vez, a tu pareja y a ti, les cueste un poco de trabajo encontrar el “mágico Punto G” pero sin embargo, vale la pena, pues podrán adicionar placer, experiencia y nuevas sensaciones a la relación sexual.

caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	My only question is - - aren't you having a cocktail hour for your guests at the reception?  The cocktail hour is there to occupy your guests while you are off having your photos taken.  If you don't have one planned, I suggest you plan it!!<br>  <br>  So back into your schedule like this - - - <br>  If your guests are to arrive for 6pm at the reception, then your ceremony should end by 5:15 (to allow a little time for the receiving line then travel to the reception).  This is where you need your pastor to determine how long the service is.  My pastor says it is only about 20 minutes, so assuming yours is the same, I would schedule your ceremony for 4:30.<br>  Your reception should be a cocktail hour from 6pm - 7pm, then the bride & groom arrive/are introduced and the all-out reception begins (dinner, dancing, toasts, first dance, cake cutting, etc).<br>  <br>  To be brutally honest, most guests will go straight from the church to the banquet hall.  My fiance's cousin had about an hour in-between the end of the service and the reception.  We got a flat tire and made it just a little early to the reception - - when we arrived there was a pack of family standing outside the doors complaining that they had been standing there for an hour and couldn't get in.  I asked if they read their invitation that the reception wasn't scheduled to start until 5 - - they said they didn't care and that as soon as the ceremony ended they drove right to the hall. My fiance made me promise that we wouldn't put more than 30 minutes in-between our ceremony & reception start time.|`|8Raw4M1naa	Weddings can run late sometimes, like mine. It was an hour and half before we acctually got to start. Its your wedding, and people who are coming from out of town will have a hotel to go back to. Some of them can use the time to go home and get dressed into something more casual, at least for a little while. High heels can be so painful and a nice relief is a good thing. You can reccomend some sights about your area to see, but just remember, its your day, they can find something to do for a few hours. :)|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Move it up to 5, it should be enough time.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Can you appoint someone to the reception hall to greet guests?<br>  <br>  For ours we are going to do the bridal party pictures first thing after the ceremony that way my maid of honor, brides maid, and groomsmen can go to the reception site, set up and be ready for when people start trickling in.  <br>  <br>  This way I can still get the family photos etc, and then at the end have some time with just me and my new hubby to get those really cute romantic looking photos.  Since everyone will be heading to the reception we won't have to worry about them all trying to talk to us and can relax.  <br>  <br>  I would not have more than an hour between the ceremony & reception.  If the reception is for 6pm, Try for a 4:30 ceremony.  Well...technically 4pm.  Figure people will start showing up at about 4pm, but the ceremony won't actually start until 4:30, over at 5, do pictures...go to reception.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EI7QLonBaa	my advice on the timing would be to do your pictures AFTER the reception. at my wedding we did the pictures of me before the wedding and then after the wedding all of the guests were at the banquet hall waiting (and starring at the cake) for what seemed like eternity because our photographer took so long. some people even left. by the time that the wedding party got to the banquet hall everyone was exhausted. . . . PICTURES AFTER! :) that's my opinion.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I have never heard of having large gaps of time between ceremony and reception until I came on yahoo Answers.  I think (and it could be because of what is the norm where I live) that asking anyone to wait an hour sometimes longer between ceremony and reception is rude.  The reception should start immediately after the ceremony.  My photographer is coming to my parents house about 2 1/2 hours prior to the ceremony, taking all the pics of me and my girls, parents, etc. Then he goes to the ceremony site and take the pics of the groom, groomsmen, his parents, etc.  Then he take the ceremony pics and after the ceremony he takes about 20 minutes to shoot the rest of the formal pictures while the guests get settled, get a drink, hor'derves start being passed.  That way, no one is inconvenienced with having to find something to do while pics are taken.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	More than an hour in between, and you're in for a lot of people getting bored, impatient and wondering where else they'd rather be, especially if you've got children on the guest list.<br>  <br>  A photographer who really needs an entire hour to get photos done isn't a very efficient one. <br>  <br>  That would be my limit. Planning is everything, and it can be done.<br>  <br>  Best of luck !!
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Can you take any pictures before the ceremony? If you are opposed to seeing each other before, talk to your photographer to see what they can do about filming you and your fiance separately and then having any pics with both of you after the ceremony. That way, they don't take as long. Honestly, keep the gap between the ceremony and reception as short as possible. That is one of the biggest guest gripes that you hear about.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Depending upon the logistics of travel time, usually you need at least an hour to an hour and a half at the studio.<br>  So if, for example, you have your ceremony at 2 p.m., it's done by three, then you go for pictures.<br>  Schedule cocktails for 5 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m. - then you have time after pictures for a bit of a break, before arriving at the reception place just before dinner.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	If its at the same location, 30 minutes. If people are driving to the reception location, you have 1 hour.<br>  <br>  Either way, some light refreshments or at the very least, drinks (need not be alcoholic though) should be provided during this time. It lets your guests know you havent forgotten about them, and makes them feel like the party will start soon. It will also help them mingle and talk to each other rather than just sit in their cars.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I would say an hour tops, just because I think people would get cranky after that.  (Shorter if they are not in the pictures, maybe have someone go ahead and open up the reception so people can visit and have something to drink)  I was trying to figure out the same thing, and I want A LOT of photos...so I decided the groom should take this photos before the ceremony (groom w/ parents, groom w/ groomsmen etc).   <br>  <br>  And then we will take pictures together and me with my bridesmaids after the ceremony so he doesn't have to see me before.|`|qfUjyUDTaa	Maybe two hours? I would think that would be enough for photos.<br>  <br>  Are you going to provide drinks and nibbles to keep guest occupied while you're getting your pics taken?<br>  <br>  Two hours should be fine - thats been the norm at all the weddings ive attended!<br>  <br>  ADD: This two hour suggestion only works if you're keeping your guests happy with drinks, nibbles, music etc....If you're not doing that then you need to keep the gap really short, an hour max!! <br>  <br>  Doing seperate photos before the wedding and couple/group photos after is  a really good idea!!|`|xPT0YXRIaa	45 mins
SJx9IWWtaa	Your invitations sound lovely.  :)  <br>  <br>  Making your own CAN be cost effective, the best idea is to do a price check on all the supplies your wanting before you by.  Its amazing how something can add up and end up being more expensive than if you had just bought them already made.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	It was less expensive for me.  I actually didn't totally make my own.  We went to a place and chose the design, font and colors I wanted.  The company printed them off, and then we actually put it all together.  I dont know if that makes sense or not, but basically I had 2 pieces of paper, one was aqua colored and had the writing on it.  We glued that to a piece of brown paper to bring in my other wedding color.  We also put 2 brown ribbons around the aqua paper.  I forget how much we saved by doing it ourselves, but it was quite a bit.  They turned out SO cute, plus it was really fun to make them ourselves!  Your idea sounds really neat too.  Happy planning!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	It is a great idea, and cheap, but I would get some help because doing it by yourself will take a long time.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	They are cost-effective if you buy a kit and dont care if they look like crap.<br>  If you are sourcing quality papers and materials, and are meticulous about them, they will equal or more expensive (not to mention time-consuming) than ordered invitations.<br>  <br>  I made my own. They werent cheap. But they were beautiful, and I dont regret it. If you want to make your own for the love of it, go for it! If you want to make them simply to save money, I dont recommend it.|`|crxbob5jaa	It does sound beautiful. My only suggestion would be to make a sample copy and take it to the post office with the envelope to see if you will have to pay additional postage. That could be the only problem I know.|`|LlsCclIcaa	we are making our own, and we are going to use a combination of a white base card, a pearl/silver square taped over it and Fred Hosking specialty sheer/printed papers to print on, finished with a pearl/silverish ribbon. We could have used all these from the Fred Hosking brand but decided not to do so as it would cut a lot in costs to just go out and find a cheaper pack of plain white base card A4 sheets, and silver paper. We will also take plain white thick envelopes instead of the matching ones (100 pack for 3 dollars rather than 10 pack for 15 dollars matching envelopes). and we have also opted for DL size invites/thank you cards and A6 size save the date cards. In total I think we will spend about 200 dollars but this will include: save the date cards (in 3 layers of different papers), invites, thank you cards, place cards, menus for each guest and also a cover for the order of service and ceremony booklets. as far as rsvp cards go, we will not include them but on the invite we will print "please rsvp to bridesname.groomsname@hotmail.com or call 04xx xxx xxx by xx month 20xx" it saves us envelopes stamps and paper as well (we have seen this done by friends before and it worked for them - no one thought this was tacky at all).<br>  <br>  so as you can see we have a complete set of stationary for about 60 invites for approx 200 - 250 australian dollars. I realize it will take time and effort to make these but hey our wedding is only planned for 2011 or 2012 so heaps of time to make it right.|`|yGP1jchDaa	Making your own is definitely the way to go. it can be both a cheap option or an expensive option. Like anything it depends on how much ground work and research you do.<br>  Your design sounds great and it can look elegant better than store bought.<br>  tips to reduce expenses - scrapbook store will let you use their cutters and stuff for a nominal fee so check them out.<br>  ribbon is the best embellishment and it is so inexpensive.<br>  kits are ok but it is still cheaper if you prepare and cut all the prods by hand.<br>  fonts. travelers script is pretty (most places sell it but i do remember finding it for free somewhere), jane austin, <br>  stamping produces great results.<br>  check out some diy invitations at <a href="http://www.make-your-own-invitations.com/make-your-own-wedding-invitation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.make-your-own-invitations.com...</a>|`|vyL7yEleaa	yes it will be a lot cheaper then printed invitations, if you go to a paper store you can get a huge ream of paper for like $20 which is anywhere from 250 sheets to 500 sheets of paper.<br>  <br>  your design sounds beautiful and your guest will remember your invitations more because they are hand made.. they are not your normal everyday mass produced wedding invitation that they have probably seen a million times before. <br>  <br>  i made my invitations. and only cost me $60 and with that i have enough to do my invitations, RSVP, programs and envelopes. were is just the invitations from a company would have cost me $102 not including the rsvp and programs. so doing it yourself saves a bundle of money.<br>  <br>  i would suggest if you have one in the area going to paperzone.. they have a huge selection and very cheap.|`|EI7QLonBaa	i'm a very crafty person and i hand make all my cards and invitations for every occasion. i think they are more personal and people hold on to them as a keepsake more so than something that is store bought. I personally think that its worth it. and if you buy the supplies in bulk and do your own thank yous and everything else - it's definitely cost effective. :)|`|XZ0XvGUzaa	I am getting married in november and have been asking myself the same questions... my suggestion is to go to the store and make a sample invitation and see about how much the sample invitation cost and then just estimate how much it will cost... I found out that it would be pretty much cheaper for me to buy my invitations than to buy them... Good luck planning!|`|qIVy4eloaa	Your hand made invitation idea was so great!<br>  It surely brings out your creativity.<br>  <br>  You know, anything thats customized or made by the heart is much valuable than higher price. I think, if you do that customized invitation, it will become more appreciated. =)|`|lvOR401haa	Hey -<br>  <br>  I am going to be making mine too, and it IS cost effective so long as you don't buy pre-made add-ons which can cost a lot in large numbers.<br>  <br>  I love the idea of the booklet style - they look so pretty when finished and are different.<br>  <br>  My advice would be:<br>  <br>  Invest in (or borrow) a paper cutter to cut cards to shape, rather than buy pre cut ones.  <br>  <br>  Cut the card to the size of a readily available standard envelope  <br>  <br>  Use a 'bone tool' to make the creases to fold along.  You can get guides with 'lines' to draw the tool across for all kinds of card styles, including books like you want.  They only cost a few pounds (inc tool) in the UK, so I would imagine they're not a lot in the US either - cheaper online.<br>  <br>  You'll be able to get good quality cream/white/ivory envelopes in larger packs online.<br>  <br>  If you want to decorate them: buy a shape cutter, such as a heart, and mass cut in coloured card to match colour scheme/ribbon  Overlay these onto other colours that match the scheme and place onto the front.  If you do a split front booklet style, it may look nice to put the decorations over the centre of the opening, but attached to one side only to allow it to open.  Hope that makes sense!<br>  <br>  Use an italic font on your printing, and use good paper (again, you'll get this cheaper from the internet).<br>  <br>  I just made 100 invites for a friend for ￡20, and to buy pre-cut cards and envelopes would have been about ￡40 before you've even started.  They are exactly what she wanted, personalised and free for her (was part of our gift to her).  She loved them as they were simple and elegant and different to any she'd seen in stores - so I am a fan of making them - people will love them :-)<br>  <br>  Hope to have helped :-)
RbI3Pj44aa	Os camarada aí prá cima já responderam.<br>  Vou acrescentar algo importante, principalmente para as mulheres.<br>  Os circuncisados ficam com o pênis diferente dos n?o-circuncisados, justamente porque, após a remo??o dessa "pele", o membro se desenvolve melhor (fica muito mais apresentável!).<br>  Eu fui circuncisado quando tnha três anos, por isso n?o sei te dizer como foi, pois n?o lembro.

What really stimulates you is the question? are u physical visual?etc. I need both I have to use my imagination. Close your eyes and picture someone, some act, some thought that gets you "hot." Until you meet someone you can please you. Use a toy turn off the lights, whatever. There is another way that requires only you laying on your stomach and "wiggling" or grinding. It works for those where touching yourself doesn't work.

Primeiro n?o entendi direito sobre o que se refere este mais aí, porém dá entender que dá referência a como agradar, tudo bem...<br>    Vc deve agradar o teu namorado até onde n?o lhe ponha em prejuizo, pois tudo que vc vai fazer para agradar o  outro que a deixa em prejuizo, n?o é recomendável, e nem inteligente, pois por mais que vc o quera agradar com tudo, se ele tiver que te tracar vc será trocada do mesmo jeito, ent?o se valorize para que n?o vivas escrava de terceiros...<br>    No normal , uma pessoa ′se torna agradável a outra pelo carinho, pelo afeto, pelos planos e projetos, pelo cuidado, e pelo amor que se demonstra de um para o outro, o que n?o precisa envolver precocemente o sexo antes do casamento... Porém , a sociedade dos desinformado est?o levando este agradar para o sexo, daí, t?o todo mundo afundando na lama, porque tranzam tranzam , e no final , ninguém tá mais gostando de ninguém , porque come?ou a comer antes do tempo e ja logo enjoam porque ofertas melhores v?o surgindo apra a frente para os homens , enquanto a mulher vai ficando no prejuizo, ja que os homens v?o sempre escolhendo as mais novas e elas v?o envelhecendo....<br>  Acho que caberia na atualidade , cada mulher se valorizar com valor que merecem , valorizarem o namoro honesto, o qual n?o leva o sexo, e chegar ao casamento se deseja fazer sexo,assim , estaria o sexo se unindo ao valor que a mulher possui , valorizando a mulher, o que n?o ocorre numa entrega ao sexo antes do casamento, pois este desvaloriza a mulher, porque ela n?o ganha um marido para o casamento, ela ganha um parcero para o sexo , o qual perde no caminho para outra mulher , antes de chegarem no casamento, por haverem come?ado errado as coisas!!!<br>  Ent?o no meu ver, vc deve agradar o teu namorado , sem se por em prejuizo para agradá-lo, porque vc é importante, e n?o pode nem deve , lan?ar fora teus valores ...|`|7H3Y8PnEaa	olá Baby..<br>  ...se ele realmente gosta de você....<br>  ...ele tem que te aceitar da forma que vc é!!(concorda???))<br>  .;..mas um carinho a mais n?o faz mal a ninguém correto??????<br>  experimente "brincar um poquinho"( vc sabe em que sentido srsrsrsrsrsr)<br>  mas se ele quizer algo a mais eu sei que vc n?o vai negar fogo!!mas tbm cuidado para n?o se soltar d+!!!<br>  bjusssss|`|910WM3zmaa	N?o fa?a nada.

Aunque podría ser cualquier otra excusa que te inventes, eliges está porque el marketing está bien estudiado y porque en el fondo, si estás enamorado, estas idiota, flotas, vuelas y haces cualquier cosa que tenga velas y música romántica.<br>  <br>  No es malo celebrarlo, pero sin pasarse, que lo que quieren es que gastemos dinero. Creo k es un buen día para dar sorpresas hechas con nuestras propias manos, ejemplo:<br>  <br>  -un album de fotos con fotos de la pareja<br>  -un cd con canciones especiales<br>  -una cena casera e intima<br>  <br>  Felicidades a los enamorados, y animo y un besazo a los que lo estais pasando mal!!

haabfMtkaa	It sound like the only one acting like an adult here is you.  Your love for you Grandpa is obvious and admirable. It sound like your grandpa soon to be wife is great.<br>  Adults act really weird when it comes to money especially if they don't have any. This in my opinion is what there negative act is coming from that and fear of the un known. Your family have been selfish with there father for a long time and he needs to put a stop to it. This is his life and you ALL deserve to be happy. <br>  You cant control this or change it so you need to let there feelings go. Your Grandpa knows you love him! Do well in school for your Grandma she is still with you. You will get better you all will. For me and my husband(we both lost our moms) it was about 2 years till I could say we were okay.<br>  Your mom as for her comments she is insecure for not being a parent to you. For her to say that was really wrong. Im sorry. The best thing you can do is go to college get a great paying job and don't give her a once of support. But you have to forgive her or else you will be the one to suffer from it.Thank god for your Grand parents and make them proud of who you became at least they will have that.<br>  Let go of there pain and move forward in your life...GOOD LUCK!!|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	Your grandfather has every right to happiness and if he loves and gets along with this new woman then more power to him.<br>  Your relatives are probably lashing out because they hoped to control your grandfather and get more money out of him and may actually be afraid that this woman will see that they are sponging off him and put a stop to all the free money. Which frankly I hope she does. <br>  They may also be afraid when he eventually dies she'll get his estate.<br>  Just try to keep your chin up and ignore them. Enjoy your grandfather and his new (maybe soon) wife.<br>  I lost my Mom when she was only 52 and my Dad remarried fairly fast he was happy and enjoyed life. Which for me was great, Some of my siblings gave him grief about it but he put his foot down and told them it was his life and he wasn't about to go around whining and moaning and live a lonely life.|`|eLR0dpUdaa	All have have to say is that death is a celebration of life and I am sure your grandma wouldn't want your whole family to be miserable and mourning her death, she did tell your grandpa that.  You are trying to move on and do good things for yourself and your family is just not there yet.  Don't let them bring you down.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Grandpa had many months before she died in which to do his grieving. In a way when she did actually die, it brought closure. He had a happy marriage and wants to have it again. You sound like a good kid, just keep doing what you're doing. You can't control what other people say and do, and just try to stay out of their squabbles.|`|AA10075228	Things like this are hard to answer, I can tell you still are grieving for the loss of your Grandmother, but your Grandfather does have a right to go on with life.  Money plays a big factor after a family loses a loved one whether we like to admit it or not, but your Grandfather is still a young man and needs to be able to make his own decisions.  It is good that you are living with him as your Mother does not sound like a very happy person to live with. Stick by your Grandfather, but do NOT argue with your Mother about this situation, it is a no win situation for everyone that opposes the new woman in your family.  Hold on tight to what you have and get through school, you are too young to worry about all of your other relatives think, you need your Grandfather right now, and he needs you too.   Good luck.
QMTII7gFaa	i personally don't think you should make her jealous. if i were you, i'd just keep going on with life. obviously you two weren't meant to be friends, so i'd try and stay away from her as much as i can. although she's making you depressed and all, this is just another difficulty that you're gonna face throughout life.... (:|`|4FEWk75aaa	That really sucks. I wish I went to your school so I could slap her! Anyway, I think you need to get one of your old friends back. Start by calling one of them and explaining everything to them. Try to create a bond with her by inviting her over. Trust me, your life may be miserable, but you would be surprised how much better it will be if you have one friend. Who knows, this could even make your ex-friend jealous?|`|g3Dn1UqIaa	i was in just abut this same situation my 7th grade year  and i got really depressed i felt like i had nobody i never fit into any of the cliques at my school either it was just me and my friends and sadly this is just something i have realized a lot of people like myself will go through in middle school it will be hard for a while i admit but things will eventually get better and by the time you hit high school you will start realizing who people truly are and what they are capable of and it will surprise you its just kinda up to you to decide who is really worth the pain. but i can say it will eventually get easier you will find at least one person you could trust your life with you know they wpuld jump in front of a bullet for you and you would do the same for them. sometimes its just about finding someone who isn't afraid to show you who they really are those are usually the people that wont hurt you without reasoning|`|ernGenbDaa	hahah disavow! i am now 20 years old but when i was your age the same thing happened to me and it totally felt like the end of the world so i understand and if someone tell you that she said something their just trying to get you guys to fight because they are probably bored and they want ot see some action. so if they say well she says you a **** or whatever just "wow i guess im that important that she spent her time talking about me because honestly i forgot she even existed because she is not worth my time. in other word show her that what she does or says does not matter at all this totally worked for me plus i made new friend with out even trying because people like people who don't give a crap about rumors|`|6oxRJwZWaa	I can really relate to this some of my friends are terrible to me and i hate it. If this girl is as nasty as you say she is then she has waaaay more problems than you, but don't focus on that for revenge. i know it is really ruff when your friends turn against you but the best way is to just ignore them. i know you have probably heard this before and i know it is hard try to make some new better friends even a small group of good Friends is better than a large group of bad friends. you also said you don't fit in with the people at your school so try to do something in your community to make friends, like volunteering good for high school when you need those hours. Hang in there.
JUjsPvNVaa	well its cool that you mention her and stuff, but 24 hours a day? if your on a date with a girl, it's about her and you... not your sister. It might seem to her like your in love with your sister... and that's weird, and it can weird a girl out.|`|AA11136495	it may sound like you have something weird with your sister (even though its not the case)<br>  <br>  or simply that, why would they want to hear you talk about how great another girl in your life is?<br>  focus your attention on how amazing your girlfriend is and not just your sister..|`|a4i45Yumaa	I am gonna say you are just being funny on the computer, because I just saw a question from you a few minutes ago asking pretty much the same thing.  At least I hope you are joking otherwise I would say you have the hots for your sister.|`|nntYLv2aaa	"I talk about my sis 24 hours a day." Maybe they get tired of hearing about your sister. Why don't you try doing a little less talking and listen to your girlfriend some?|`|wncdhUxDaa	Well they may find it a little odd. Its not really first date sort of stuff you know? They might be a bit irritated too that you seem more interested in your sister then you do them.. I think its nice you get along so well with your sister but maybe you should leave off informing your dates of how much fun you have together and how you always have tickle fights ;) Also girls probably aren't really interested in your sister and how great she is and don't need to be reminded of it heaps. Maybe talk more about them and what they enjoy, because people love talking about themselves (just don't ask TOO many questions!)<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|28d6298071cd55e7d2a470d15a36f442aa	both of you need to stop telling your dates about how you have tickle fights with your brother or sister..its just weird.<br>  you and your sister should just date eachother, mind as well.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	zach morris doesn't have a sister|`|A6mczoMbaa	lol|`|74gPuaXMaa	They consider it weird. :/|`|j0tPzIuSaa	Because maybe to them it seems a little more than a brotherly love
bbMi6Fknaa	maybe because she looks like an animal twitching and rolling around while her brother tickles her. <br>  <br>  or maybe its because her bf is there and your like molesting her. <br>  <br>  hmmmm<br>  is there more to this.........<br>  hmmmmmmmmmmm....|`|a4i45Yumaa	Umm....that's weird!  How old are you?  If she has a b/f I hope she's at least 13, and that's weird to tickle someone that old!  You should stop tickling each other with or without her boyfriend around.  Do you secretly like your sister?  Something to think about! lol!  I can't stop laughing at this question!|`|X2z7mbfaaa	when you tickle someone it leaves them very vulnerable. If a boyfriend is present this shows a shift of power that would make your sister very uncomfortable. It's just a self-conscious issue|`|2aWIXkq5aa	She's probably embarrassed when you tickle her because she is trying to act grown up in front of her boyfriends and when you tickle her she may think her boyfriends will think she is immature.|`|K7SFaYEHaa	you make gross faces and noises when your tickled,plus,it probably appears like incest,you judge|`|A6mczoMbaa	how many boyfriends does she have|`|6p6JB09laa	i'll agree with Stevie Stacks , Lucy and Sunshine Queen<br>  so Stop It !  lol|`|IFd94XDkaa	I think it's more than just embarrassment.  <br>  <br>  1- It makes her appear vulnerable to these guys and that's not good.<br>  <br>  2- It makes her look like a little girl and not the mature woman that she is probably trying very hard to be.  <br>  <br>  Please stop tickling her in front of people.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Stop it shes embarrass|`|AA10108216	it's embarrassing. <br>  <br>  when you tickle someone, they can't control the noises they make or the faces they make & she doesn't want to look silly in front of her boyfriend.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It's because it seem embarassing to her.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	You are embarrassing her in front of her friends.

jofuVL9Baa	Above all, please don't cheat, as you are doing wrong to yourself.  The cheating from your classmates is irrelevant.  Analyze if you have changed your habits, if you administrate your time wisely, if you are getting enough sleep, if you are watching too much t.v., playing too much wii, etc.  sometimes we make changes all too subtly and don't realize it until it becomes very apparent.  Another thing that might be happening if none of the above applies, is that you might have Attention Deficit Disorder (a.k.a ADD) and not know it.  It doesn't just appear, but you may not have noticed it until now because let's say you have it at a level 4, and school wise, each year represents a level of attention challenge:  1st grade=level 1; 2nd grade=level 2, etc.  so now that you are in the 4th grade and you have ADD level 4, you are being greatly challenged and until now it has become apparent, do you understand?  It is fairly easy to diagnose.  Usually it takes a visit to a neuropedriatics doctor (for children) ( I don't know what the name for an adult would be) and upon a series of questions that the doctor makes and possibly an electroencephalogram, it can be determined if this condition is prevalent.  The electro is done with hair washed with neutral soap and diodes attached to your head with a clay-like material, which is connected to a computer that "reads" your brain waves.  Usually, this condition is treated with medication that could affect your liver, but there is a product called "attentive child" made of natural herbs, can be bought at a natural products store and works great.  My 9 year old boy was diagnosed and this is my personal experience with him.  You should talk to your mom about this possiblity.  I hope this information helps, and Good Luck!|`|1vi7PX0Faa	I have classmates like that before. They don't study well but when exams came, they copy one another so they get higher scores than me who tried my best to study. It's really unfair.<br>  <br>  I think you should tell your Mom the truth of what is happening in your class so that she will not get upset when she sees you did not get the usual high grades.|`|gqbkUF5Zaa	You don't exactly have to tell her about it because that might maker her a little bit upset knowing that you're trying to cheat your way into honors classes. That isn't very honorable. <br>  Don't let anybody copy your work. No one deserves a grade that you worked hard for and they just look at your paper and get it. If you know you can do it then you can do it! Just work a little bit harder. If you were in honors once before then you can do it again. Just have faith.|`|GZ0E8Uksaa	This situation only benefits you and your future. You work so hard to earn your grade, maybe you should talk about it to your counselor.|`|jRZmU5JUaa	Don't tell your mom and just learn from this mistake.
174pexgPaa	Well after reading this, it seems like you BOTH really like eachother but going out just isn't the thing for you too.  The truth is, is that she seems jealous, and doesn't want to let you hang out with other girls.  She wants attention and when you don't give it to her, (like not answering the calls) she goes crazy and calls you a bunch, feeling like she would loose you.  Your decision to keep her as a friend is the smartest thing to do.  Remember, you both broke up in the first place for a reason.<br>  <br>  good luck and keep cool|`|IaIs8foRaa	To me it sounds like she has really strong feelings for you but she just doesn't want to admit it.I think you should call her and talk to her about it.Good luck!|`|6tn8DJajaa	i will tell you what is going on in her mind beyond any shadow of a doubt... <br>  <br>  she does still have feelings for you, and still has a connection to you... but there is some reason that she has decided that she doesnt want to be with you....she doesnt want to lose that connection with you, because she obviously thinks u really are a great guy. <br>  <br>  now onto why she doesnt want to just get back together with her....women want want they cant have just like men do, it seems that you have let her know beyond any shadow of a doubt that she can have u back at any time, but why woudl she??? she is getting all the comforts of your old relationship, this being your attention, your love, your physical attention, and your time..... what is there to make her want to commit herself to you, when you are committed to her without her taking ANY of the risk??<br>  <br>  so my advice is to go with your gut here... if you want a chance to have her back, she has to see what life is like without you in it... she has to miss you and see what she is acutally  losing ... you have been very mature and kind to this girl, and she has not wrong you per se, but she doesnt have to make a move....<br>  <br>  you do not want to get in the friends zone with this girl, so agree with her that you two shoudlnt get back together, and then stop contact for a couple of weeks with her.. if she calls or texts or whatever, dont jump to answer, dont tell her your feelings anymore, dont let her know u love her or any of that... maybe talk to her briefly and then say u have to go... .in this time work on yourself, find something u can improve in yourself and start improving!  after a couple of weeks if she is still contacting you, answer her and be friendly...<br>  <br>  make it seem like you have moved on, and dont talk about missing her, and dont fall for her telling you how much she is missing you... once she sees that you arent going to tell her how incredibly much u have missed her, she will prolly start wondering if she has lost u forever.... this has a strange effect... you are what she wants it seems, but you need to be less open right now, and a little cockier maybe... be funny and not so available..... <br>  <br>  evenutally maybe SHE will come to you and ask to get back together...|`|ixmaM395aa	She wants to own you but she does not want to be with you.<br>  <br>  She hates the idea of you being with anyone else but she can't quite fully commit herself to you. Let this one go. She's going to do you far more harm than good and she'll just break you heart all over again. <br>  <br>  Let her find someone else to manipulate and you go find happiness with a girl that honestly cares about you.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Jattster, from what i read through your letter, i get this...............,<br>  <br>  She's very much in love with you........, no second guess.<br>  And think back about your old lifestyle,<br>  are you not giving her the attention that she really need most of the time ?<br>  And ask yourself, do you really love her as she is ?<br>  <br>  For she said that she never wanna be back with you,<br>  this, to me is a total waste of lies that she said,<br>  if,say before the break up, did you really care for her ?<br>  if not, which means you had hurt her before and she's creating<br>  all the scenes to say that she'll never be back together with you.<br>  But I believe on the contrary that it is not true that she don't want <br>  you back.<br>  Hence when you ask her twice, she shoot back the same answers.<br>  For, if she says that she wanna be back with you,<br>  maybe she's afraid that you'll lead her on for a second break up,<br>  and this will totally smash her into pieces.<br>  <br>  Just think over carefully, and don't lie to your own conscience.<br>  And I've read all the answers from others, maybe I'm wrong,<br>  but the answers were focusing on wronging the girl instead of<br>  you, as I believe, we actually need to know what leads to the break up, because people are answering for what you ask now<br>  and not for what had cause the story behind the curtain.<br>  <br>  Ha !! now I get it, or so I thought.<br>  If you and everyone had thought she's bad,<br>  why would you want to make up with her anyway ?<br>  Doesn't this sound silly ?<br>  I think you owe her one, buddy.|`|zka26204aa	No matter who does the breaking up, both people hurt.  She is really afraid of being on her own, for the fact that she may not be able to find someone that is as dependable as you are.  I would not let her string you along.  Tell her that you can not have a friendship with her right now, but maybe at a later date when the pain is gone, you can work something out.  Don't let her put your life on hold by playing with your emotions.  Let her go and actually see if that is what she really wants.  That is the only way for her to be sure.  If it is meant to be, she will be back after she finds out what it is like to be without you.  Don't let her come back temporarily, however, not even just for sex.  that is too convenient and she will never get to know how it feels without you around.|`|42A0cw0Faa	Okay from a chicks opinion she still has feelings from the relationship you all had doesn't know how to get ride of them. I imagine she doesn't know how to leave you and have a normal life. I mean you were there for her as a friend and lover right? That kind of person can't just disappear in our life and mind.. Am i making sense here?|`|7MH3NW7Caa	oh yess, she definatelly has feelings for you.<br>  she cant let you go .<br>  shes still loves yoouuu.<br>  <br>  and it hurts her when you said to her that  you dont wana talk to her anymore.<br>  i mean she loves you and all she doesnt wanna let you go, but on the other hand she doesnt wanna tell you that.|`|6p6JB09laa	she doesn't know WHAT she wants, not many women do.<br>  do what YOU want with her or without her in your life as a friend or not<br>  no biggie..she seems to be holding you for emotional ransom ..or trying...|`|ZsEBqBYvaa	obviously she still loves you very much.. why not give a chance to your relationship?|`|63tch8D5aa	your both strong individuals. <br>  yes it was a year ago, but now you both are back in each others lifes, its there a reason for that, meant to be maybe?<br>  girls like a challenge, she was messing with your mind, maybe she was upset about a past challenge or something?<br>  <br>  its obvious she cares about you,<br>  but she did something i would never be able to go,<br>  she loves you,<br>  she cried,<br>  but hugged you and decided to tell to let you go,<br>  maybe not now,<br>  but i m sure one day at time she is learning to.<br>  <br>  shes very strong for what she did, so give her credit.<br>  <br>  put all the past stuff in the past,<br>  and keep it there.<br>  <br>  <br>  look at the future,<br>  let her in maybe?<br>  before its to late ;)|`|M9iOiYZtaa	i guess she made a mistake and now she realize that.The fear of not having you in her life make her still at least make you as her friend..<br>  <br>  maybe if you have a thing for her,go for it.take her back.<br>  <br>  but if you want to,my advice is to let her go.you dont wanna brake her heart later on when you go out with someone else.that will only complicate things.trust me.|`|MpbYCsygaa	She probably loves you but she does not want to be with you so she wants to have her cake and ice cream too she want to date other ppl but still have you on the side and know you will always be there.<br>  Just let her go and see if she goes crazy missing you and wants to be back in a relationship with you again if not just move on and find another woman that is willing to love you too!|`|vjlomAvjaa	I think she does care for you but no longer in love with you. If she did then she would want to be with you. She is probably sad that you are parting ways since you were a big part of her life at one point and it's not easy saying bye. Only time will tell if she loves you but I don't think she does and if she does it'll hit her soon but maybe by then it'll be too late. <br>  Good luck to you.|`|bEFHzitFaa	Shes a dumb ***. its like your not playing with a ball but when some kid takes it off u, u want it back! shes like that. when she has you she doesnt want you and when ur gone she wants you. 4get her babe so many other chicks out there.<br>  <br>  hope it helps!|`|ohNw3sDBaa	i think she does but at the same time i think shes scared to see you with anther girl, becuase she knows that will hurt her so very much.<br>  so shes holding on and shes unsure what she wants right now.|`|i5zkKOp9aa	prob, if you have strong feelings for her go talk to her about it|`|1HBTNU5Oaa	how old are both of you? you breaking off the contact will make her wonder and wonder about why you did that and make her want you even more. thats a good way to get her back. i'd say she has strong feelings for you. if you come to that point, talk things over and make sure you both want it. it'll all work out the way its suppose too. let the pieces fall into place and go with the flow.|`|U1I2vEM9aa	It sounds to me like she want to keep you "close enough" but not too close.  She may care for you, but for the most part seems like a game to her...and a little bit like she doesn't want to be with you, but she doesn't want anyone else to be with you either!  She's selfish.  She wants to do her own thing with whoever, but can't respect you enough to let you do the same and be happy.  Selfish.  You 2 are ex's for a reason and doesn't seem like things are going to change, so you should definitely cut ties.  As long as she knows she can do what she wants and keep you strug along on the side, she's winning, and she will keep it that way.  Best thing to do for you and her, is to cut ties.  Doesn't mean you can never be friends again but as long as there are feelings involved (whether they are one sided or not) it is risky territory trying to be friends with someone who is so selfish and wants the best of both worlds.  She can't have all the perks of a long term boyfriend and none of the committment.  Think about it. You're smart!  Move on, she is obviously doing the same.  Beat her at her game!  Good Luck!
gELcwzNhaa	go to the movies with her man ..but dont ask her out yet!<br>  see how the movie goes and if she acts as though she wants to be more then a friend or something eg. gives you hints and flirts lots (at the movies)<br>  <br>  then ask her out at school or even then perhaps?<br>  just go for it <br>  best of luck|`|MpbYCsygaa	bbyr that was completely hilarious!<br>  But I think it's pretty sweet that you would actually post a question here about this girl you must really like her and I don't think she's joking and if she was and turns you down just fall out on the floor and star screaming and yelling while beating the ground with your fist yelling take me out take me out right now!!!!|`|MIsXhDLcaa	she probably said no in the beginning, then realized that u mightve been serious so said yea, so w.e. go for it, it wnt be the end of the world.|`|bbMi6Fknaa	text her. <br>   <br>  <br>  "sup baby. im a complete creeper and talk about you on yahoo questions, yeah, wanna go out now?"|`|DwiQ66qyaa	I think she was serious.<br>  <br>  Call her and see if her voice gets excited or not....<br>  <br>  Or if she's being shy or not...<br>  <br>  Both are good :)<br>  <br>  You'll definitely notiece if she likes you or not. Also try teasing her and be like "come on tell me, or else i'd do something" and see her reaction.<br>  <br>  DON'T i repeat don't say that you were just joking around.

6Yb3o3CYaa	I have learned men like it when you order what you really want and show that you are down to earth and not afraid to be yourself. Stop worrying about what he is going to think and worry about yourself. If he doesnt like it then screw him he wasnt right for you any ways and someone better will surely come along that is right.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Ok, lets see, anything you can cut up with a knife and fork is pretty safe.  Italian food is pretty safe, chinese food is pretty safe, thai food too.  Japanese is tricky, sushi is a no no since the rolls are generally too big to put whole into your mouth and fall apart awkwardly and messily if you try to bite them in half.  Skip American food (I'm guess hamburgers and ribs fall into the same category as sandwiches for you)  Diner food should be fine, you could order some kind of baked chicken and rice.  Vietnamese, Korean and Indian are fun if you're an adventurous eater.  You're right though on the salad, but for a different reason, you don't want the guy to snap judge you;  same thing with soup.  Order some "real" food so they don't assume you're on a perpetual life altering diet or that you think you're fat.  You shouldn't worry so much.  Everyone eats and as long as you chew with your mouth shut and don't put more food in your mouth then fits, then don't worry so much. If something (like the lettuce or spaghetti you are afraid of) aren't cut small enough, cut them again yourself.   It is IMPOSSIBLE to eat without making some kind of face at some point so unless you plan to never ever eat in front of him ever, you're going to have to get over your phobia.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hey there, you crack me up cause i used to be just like you (before i got married!!)<br>  <br>  i know what you mean about sandwiches they make them so huge!!  uggggh.....<br>  <br>  why not order appetizers, like boneless chicken fingers, you can cut them up with a fork and knife.....<br>  <br>  you can get a bonelesschicken dish like chicken francaise (lemon and butter) chicken marsala (chicken, marsala wine and mushrooms) and again you can cut it up with a fork and knife, if it comes with soup or salad, get the soup, and if it comes with choice of pasta get ziti....easier to control<br>  <br>  if you get pasta, get ziti so you can pick up 1 at a time, or even ravioli that you can cut up little by little <br>  <br>  if by chance he says oh try the sandwiches, what i do is take the lettuce and tomato off so it's less slippery, eat that on the side, also i take off some of the meat/cheese whatever to make it smaller, and then use a knife to cut it in smaller pieces like finger sandwiches.....<br>  <br>  i would eat a little something before you go out with him this way you aren't starving and you can concentrate on eating slowly and your stomach won't be growling like FEED ME NOW LOL<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!  if you want to email me to let me know how it goes summerwind07044@aol.com    =p|`|733yHonMaa	casual food i guess-- like chicken fingers, fries, hot dogs<br>  <br>  perhaps grilled chicken breast, shrimp, or steak if you go some place "fancier"|`|x1FzJLwZaa	how about you just cook for both of you so you dont have to worry much about it?|`|CR7arBmbaa	Order some kind of breaded shrimp.<br>   Coconut? Yum :  )<br>   - definitely not Shrimp Parmesan - lol<br>  <br>  Eats neat and easy 'cause it's already small.<br>  <br>  When your plate comes just p/u your knife and fork and cut one tail off of a shrimp (look up and over at him across the table while talking to him and doing this) then cut the shrimp with no tail in half.<br>  <br>  You'll have a nice tiny piece of shrimp (again, YUM) to dip in a sauce or just pop in your mouth. Easy.<br>  <br>  By the by - if you s-l-o-w-l-y put any kind of food in your mouth and make eye contact it can be very sexy !  : p<br>  <br>  <br>  No worries ....relax...have fun : )|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	You know each other really well, if you are the type to be a messy eater, he is going to know that so it isn't going to matter, and if you are a tidy eater and you uh.. have lettuce hanging out of the side of your mouth at one point, just laugh about it or make a joke about it, if he is going to judge someone on the way they eat (besides from judging their kissing styles from it) then you both have a lot more coming at you if you continue to date.|`|aWaakM8baa	Well eat something like a steak that you can cut to the right size for you. Maybe try eating something like a bakes potato with some side dish... Just things that you can cut for yourself.. Goodluck!|`|U0RtiXleaa	panterA's right...but if your still nervous....anything small that fits in your mouth conviently...fries, shrimp etc;....and if you want the salad then cut it up yourself...but only liquid based dressings....ranch leaves residue on your mouth!|`|HAbx6dDCaa	no meat like streak or ribs<br>  <br>  ull look like a cave man<br>  <br>  noodles might be bad (no one looks good eating noodles)<br>  <br>  i wud go for the soup(theres alot of good soups out there!)

AA11307474	as simple as it may sound, just be direct but not rude, in a very "stealth" way try to ask him if he has any interest in you, or if he has any feelings that might blind his freindship and change that into love interest.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|2ISqwRpdaa	Don't be conceited, he probably likes you as a friend, which is what he is...right?|`|hdZd58z8aa	Maybe you should focus more on your boyfriend -- rethinking now just adds more trouble.
35FwA4kIaa	Every successful relationship that has ever been in the history of the world all started out the same way.<br>  <br>  With the word hi.<br>  <br>  Ok, maybe not, but most.  You get the idea.  Just say hello and start talking.  After you talk to him for like 30 seconds you will NEVER be shy to talk to him again.<br>  <br>  So find some courage and say hi and just talk to him and best of luck.|`|PQBU7Zxyaa	Just talk to him and instead of saying SORRY, ask him to hangout and he will see that your intrested in him. Even if not a date ask to hang out at lunch or something. trust me i was in the same situation just keep cool and pretend u have known him all your life and it will go great. lol thats what i did.|`|63tch8D5aa	how old are you?ahaaha.<br>  wow.<br>  cry? seriously?<br>  get a crip,take a chill<br>  smoke a j! haha.<br>  <br>  <br>  anyways.<br>  <br>  go talk to him,<br>  add him on myspace,<br>  <br>  maybe just friendly|`|kgfcc4PUaa	ok too much drama. turn around say sorry you didnt see him and bring up a topic. and start talking.|`|OZokMUaqaa	Wait....im a bit cunfuzzled....is he asking for help on something or trying to talk to you? Either way i would explain myself.... if you like him this is natural and if you don't he's prbably cunfuzzled too! Let him know that you get shy.....he would understand, maybe it will help the both of you...you might learn something new from him.... Tell him that you'll try to be less shy and look at him, or make it a bit of a joke....like explain that your shyness is kinda funyy, it will make you less nervouse<br>  hope this helped|`|ETHhnhLxaa	if you like him you should go to him straight away and pretend you didnt see what he did..<br>  or playfully hit him or something lol
PevKGmeFaa	maybe he wants to stay home and watch porn. or party or hang out with his girlfriend. youre younger right? youll understand when you get his age|`|8zgFyfibaa	He doesn't want to go. Being 17 years old you want to be alone or hangout with friends and not family, that's how I was when my family was going out of town I dint want to go because I had plans (girlfriend,party, etc......) <br>  <br>  No matter what you do he won't go it might hurt you but you can't change his mind. You could get some handcuffs and handcuff your hand and your brothers hand and that way he won't have no choice but to go (sarcasm)|`|1snKZafVaa	i think ur brother is old enough now to make his own descisions and if he wants to stay at home, just leave him be. dont get all annoying and like make him cards and stuff because in the end that just draws u further apart.
oDMEYSKjaa	a strip club can cause aids, hiv, and any form of other diseases you are not aware of yet until BAM...hello disease<br>  <br>  Relationship, you already know about it and can work around it|`|znxFD103aa	Theres no comparison. You could say, can you compare the difference between the attention you get at a strip club from a women, and the attention that you get from a women who you are in a relationship with, and that would have been an acceptable questions. But anyway, jusding by the question this isnt coming from a very rational standpoint to begin with. The difference between a stripper and your girlfriend, is that one wants money from you, and the other cares about you as a person. Now, if you are a real idiot you might have a girlfriend who only wants you for money too. Thats a possibilty.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	But you gotta have cash for both of them to work out.  So yeah, dude.   That being the great equalizer, and given that a relationship is such hard work for you..... I mean it IS a huge effort to have good chemistry and to take her out and all..... it sounds to me like you'll do much better at the strip club.  Good luck with that!  I hope you have a great future with your lap dancers!|`|kA9ikYIVaa	Lol in the strip club you only get to look:P<br>  <br>  with a relationship you get to CUDDLE<br>  <br>  ahaha so there are definitely perks to being in a relationship too, such as<br>  <br>  someone who will take care of you when your sick, drive you to the airport with no hassle, someone to go watch movies with, hang out with, reproduce with...<br>  <br>  a strip club is fun too, and couples go to them together all the time!|`|3eea4704cf8414e46d6ef6d3729ba82baa	I've never had a relationship, either.  But I've never been to a strip club.  There was a point made about STD's and that is a possible hazard with strippers and prostitutes.  But if you really want to be safe and satisfy your sex drive, porn is the way to go.  Like I said, I've never had a relationship; I use porn instead.  You'll still spend money, but the videos don't have STD's,  never get a headache, never cheat, never judge or criticize you, never nag, and they are available 24/7.  With a flesh-and-blood woman, you're likely to spend a lot more than $29.95 a month.  Of course, a lot of guys think it's worthwhile.|`|uJnEUX6maa	lol|`|aLF48jM3aa	"I think I finally figured it out."<br>  Well, halelujah.<br>  I don't know buddy, are STDS something you really want?<br>  Something to think about.

It's like unrealistic expectations. Don't get me wrong. Lies are usually wrong. It's just your expectations should be based on reality.|`|6oxRJwZWaa	That is an extremely difficult question to answer mostly because it does not have a definite answer. we as human being vary a lot even within the  sexes. example there may be a very dishonest man and very honest female or vise verse. it also hard to tell because men lie about different things than women. example i am a guy and i know that we always lie about the size of our penises where as many women lie about there weight or age.|`|dISHCaqhaa	The honest mind is not depend upon the sex.<br>  It is depends upon the person's mind.<br>  but the % of the honesty's is more in females.|`|OJ86MRkCaa	Honest thing is not from a sex.<br>  Both sex have honest people and not honest people|`|sIr2fWh6aa	A person's sex doesn't determine who is more trustworthy..

XmJZkFuMaa	People handle death in different ways.  For your mom, she may remember your dad and ache inside, wishing to see him, remembering his loving words, and his loving actions, and then seeing you yell out in an argument makes her feel horrible and ache for him even more.  It's not fair.  But it may be hard for her because of that.  <br>  <br>  When my brother died, my mom took all the pictures down in the house for nearly 20 years.  I would sneak and find them and look at him.  He died before I was born so I never knew him.  Years later, I was able to talk to her about him.  I've never heard my dad share a memory of him ever.  Ever.  And of my siblings who knew him, my brothers have never talked about him, my sisters only in passing (usually about something where I reminded them of him) and that's it.  It's not healthy, but that's how some families deal with a hard death like that.  <br>  <br>  The only thing I think you could have said was "I'm not him mom."  Or something like that.  And then... just forgive her.  Parent's aren't perfect you know?  You could try to talk to her about him, gently, ask about pictures, did he love you (that's a sure yes) and things like that.  Maybe she'll open up more as you finish growing up.  Maybe it'll take longer.  The fact she recognizes the reason she shies away from you shows she may be willing to fight it more.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	Your mom sounds like a biiiittcchhh.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	parents can be stupid at times. you have to be the grown up here and confront your mother. believe me... this works.. go up to her and tell her you want to talk. tell her how you feel.. and ask why she said that. you might as well cover the dad issues as well. tell her you want to know who he was.<br>  <br>  one thing i can tell you, is that  it may be that  the topic of your dad is something painful. she might not want to bring back those sad memories of him passing. if his death was sudden, she might feel like he abandoned her, and your mom might have some grieving issues she never dealt with.

When you communicate with someone, they must earn your trust, not just through words on a computer.  You have no idea who you are really talking to!  Do you know how many cases occur across the country from young girls and guys missing because of an internet predator?  You are better at living a longer and safer life by meeting people who you know from maybe a family member or through networking from true friends you really trust.  Please don't communicate with anyone on the internet for your own safety.  I teach my kids DTA- DON'T TRUST ANYONE! And they are 17, 18, and 20!!! I taught them that at 5,6, and 8yrs old.  Have you talked with anyone in person about it? Be smart about your decisions. By the way, anyone can put on a front about who they really are or what type of character and personality they have for 4 1/2 months to even up to a couple of years, especially if they hide behind a computer. Please take care of yourself and be safe.|`|4DKT06TLaa	if you are a minor(not just the law), dont date old people because you know too little about men and the world to make decisions yourself. date somebody less mature so they cant play you. i mean why would somebody 30 date somebody 17? i can see about 20s date 17 but 30 is too old chances are he/she is messing around wit you. <br>  <br>  also, talking about 4 months doesnt mean much. you have to do things together. people who are good at deciving or hiding themselves dont reveal anything when they talk. you have to do things with them|`|AA10108216	Don't do it.  A 30 year old shouldn't be asking a 17 year old for their phone number.  He's either a pedophile, kidnapper or complete pervert.<br>  <br>   You don't owe him anything and you don't have to give him your number.<br>  If he can't even show you his picture then something is very wrong.|`|F5eKBBaXaa	I felt the same way to. But hey look at me now. It went from a phone call to a fling, to dealing with a stalker. Go for it you wont regret it.|`|gqbkUF5Zaa	That's such a huge age difference considering you're still a kid and he's old enough to be married and have kids. I definitely wouldn't recommend it. I'd actually consider cutting off all contact with him. Even if you think you know him, it's the internet. No one can be trusted and you can't allow yourself to believe they are who they say they are. It's too easy to make things up.|`|eLR0dpUdaa	No way!!!! Don't give him your number.  Why do you think he not talking to  a woman his age?  He knows you are young and impressionable and he may take advantage of that.  Don't take that chance.
szX346DFaa	True friendship should be mutual, trust each others and withstand all obstacles. You may blame the person who spread the untrue rumours about you gossiping your friend. If your friend really treated you as a good friends or rather if she really valued and treasured your friendship with her, she wouldn't have believed the said rumours. At least she would have come to you and seek clarifications from you. The fact that she chose to believe the rumours from other people than believing you, it shows that there exist no trust between your friendship with her. <br>  <br>  Moreover, you have done what you could to re-establish or savage the said friendship but she is rejecting it. From all these, my advice to you is to "leave her be". Let nature takes its course. Eventhough if you somehow able to contact her or see her or talk to her, your friendship with her may not be the same as before. People change through times. <br>  <br>  As for the friend who caused such misunderstanding, you may hate her but if i were you i will think this way: "although that friend was at fault but at least she helped me to see who really my true friends!" So, just leave her alone. <br>  <br>  I am sure along the way you will find your true friends who trusted you. Best friends are by conduct not merely by words.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Be calm and relaxed if you di not hurt her really means she herself will knock your door one day or other.|`|AA11136495	send her a letter, she cant necessarily block it before it comes, and its unlikely that she will throw it away (i always have an urge to read any handwritten letter no matter who its from xD)

I ask this because guys like this make you go through this so if you aren't willing to do this (and I do not suggest it) then find someone else.<br>  <br>  2) Maybe he is not ready for a relationship with you because he seems to be interested when he is drunk so really why subject yourself to something less! you deserve better my friend. <br>  <br>  3) Besides when a man is a man he doesn't play these stupid head games he gets to the point!|`|6qJObfcEaa	Seriously, i think you don't need to waste any more of your time on this guy if you are looking to be in a relationship!! maybe he wants to be friends with benefits, you should confront him about the situation, just say"i just wanted to know, where are we going with this?are we going anywhere?i mean you need to know if he wants to get serious or if he just wants a drunk make out buddy!!|`|0VIrJY2laa	i think this guy has problemes and needs a partner only to talk to.<br>  if you like him somuch and have enough patience, you might win his heart one day..... good luck.|`|9f0cf50afc6f7907466e5a1c69fa44e8aa	He just wants you for sex and nothing more.|`|AA11302702	I think that you guys are just flirting.

They expect you to say something back, like.."yeah thats crazy...but yeah there was this girl yesterday who was all starring at me..." u know?

You are probably more liked than you realize, but just dont try so hard or worry about it so much. People notice that.

Ow6lKFXiaa	Well, this is really convoluted and I had trouble following it all.  If I understand correctly, I'd say you only have a minor part in this.  <br>  <br>  Vista is known to have problems that cause crashing, at least on windows.  With 4 people and 1/2 storage your hard drive is overwhelmed by the conflicting stuff you are all installing and downloading.  Your folks and, especially your brother, may be unknowingly downloading viruses.  You check, but does your brother? I doubt it.  Also, those sites your brother visits can infect your computer the split second you get into their site, you don't have to request a download. So you probably have more than one virus.  <br>  <br>  Your dad needs to call Macintosh Tech Support for help at fixing this.  They should be able to walk him through the vista problems and help with security and virus checks.  He should also do a hard disc cleanup and file compression. As for the missing CD, I can't help you there.  It was so long ago anyone could have misplaced it, even you and you don't remember.<br>  <br>  I hope your parents set up Parental Control Blocks when this is all over.  Your brother should NOT be visiting porn sites, that's very unhealthy for a 13 year old.  Your parents need to talk with him and honestly answer ALL all of his questions so he doesn't grow up to be some screwed up pervert.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if I've helped any...I hope I have.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I understand your feelings. I've been in more unjust situations than I can count and felt as you do, hurt and angry.  I'm also a mom so I understand your dad's reaction as well, I've done this to my own kids.  This won't be the last time, by far, that you're caught in an unfair situation.  You'll encounter them at home, in school, and on the job. This is the way of life and we need to accept that or we break.  I agree with Peggy S...let it go.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	woah, that was long so i just skimmed it.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he is being a jerk about stuff. that for sure. he doesnt have to wake you up or do anything like that.<br>  <br>  but i say, until you pay for all this stuff yourself, you just have to deal with it. when you own it, you can do what you want with it.|`|zka26204aa	You father is just frustrated, and angry about the whole situation.  You happened to be there so he took it out on you.  Let it go.

nooi0ldjaa	my aunt and uncle (not by blood)<br>  lost a twin a month after birth, they buried him said their good byes and never even bought a head stone.<br>  some people don't want to bring back the sad memory's, and just try to move on instead. sounds like that's how your parents are handling it. im sure they do care, but don't want to think about it.<br>  <br>  nothing wrong with that really.|`|wBffQgPiaa	Your parents feel too much grief, shame, guilt, etc. <br>  <br>  Visit on your own and don't discuss it with them.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	I may be able to help a bit here.  My son died 4 years ago.  I go to the grave on holidays and his birthday etc..   I only want to go alone.  I just want to sit and have time to reflect and I really don't want any one to see me or get upset.  Now my kids won't go with me. They go alone also.  Your mum will cry. It is only natural.  She lost her son at such a young age.  Mine was 26.<br>  Another idea is that they just can't face it.  I relive it like it was yesterday all day long day after day.  Maybe going out to the cemetery makes it very real for them and they just don't want to relive that pain again.  How old are you? Are you able to get there on your own?  I wish you a lot of luck on this and I understand yours and your parents pain because I am living it too.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You can go visit his grave by yourself or with a friend can't you?<br>  <br>  After Mom died i visited her grave a few times, and then i decided she wasn't really "there" so i stopped.  <br>  <br>  But it's quite ok if you want to go.<br>  <br>  Your parents probably do not go because it's difficult, hon.|`|gMK179ADaa	It could be very hard for your parents to deal with the situation. everyone reacts differently to a loss of someone close. I would suggest to have a sit down talk with your parents. Having a counselor or some other kind of third party to mediate could help also. I hope this helps.|`|yISUsjY6aa	Hun its just hard for them thats all. <br>  I understand that you want to go but the fact that your mom cries proves how hard for her it is.... its probably difficult in general life but even worst at the grave. ... good luck and sorry about ur brother|`|2aWIXkq5aa	They probably find it too painful to go there, or maybe they don't want to upset you. talk to them about it and tell them you want to go.
wpi36XBAaa	While i think you are trying to do the right thing, I don't think that it is.<br>  Hiding this sort of thing from your partner is ALWAYS a bad idea. <br>  He could resent that contact, more so because you didn't tell him about it. <br>  But what is her motivation? She wants him back, but you are in the way. Is she trying to engender sympathy in you for her situation? Trying to put a wedge between the two of you (the lying about/hiding it has to do that)? Get some dirt on him/you, so if it does go to court, she's got the ammunition she needs to get full custody? Even the fact that you choose to hide the contact might be used against you - like you can't/don't trust him to handle it. <br>  Please for your boyfriend's sake be both honest with him and be very careful what you say to her.|`|AA11391968	I would leave it just as it is and be very careful about putting in writing what you wouldn't want to see in the newspaper - (if ya know what I mean). <br>    Why doesn't your bf file for visitation on his own?  He does not need an attorney.  If he is a good father, pays support, etc., then shame on her not allowing their child to know her father.  Don't trust her.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	No... it's not your visitation battle, but your guy's issue.  You can be supportive of him, but let it alone otherwise.|`|YyP5tarFaa	Be nice to her on Myspace etc but remember she is bitter. She wants what you have and she will never have again. I'm sorry but she will have her way and hurt your man as much as she can. Save as much money for a lawyer as you can. My husband's ex kept his children away from him even though the courts awarded him joint custody every time he was denied visitation against the court order he was told to get a lawyer. The Law would not help him. We now have full custody of both his children only because she would do anything to hurt him, the children did not matter, only revenge against him. His 2 children were physically and sexually abused by his ex's boyfriends. Pay the money it is only for the kids.|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	leave her alone. don't mention your up coming legal strategy to her. for 3 years she's hated you and been pretty much a bi**h towards you and now since your man has cut all communications with her, she's suddenly your new BFF??<br>  keep being cordial towards her, but keep what goes on in your house with your man to yourself. you'll come to regret it later if you don't.|`|sBvS9FSiaa	It would probably just lead to more trouble. She doesn't sound like a mature person. You can check at your local child support office at your location but at mine either party can start child support and visitation requests.If Your cso is the same it could save you a lot of time and money.It never hurts to ask,just make sure your bf does the asking.They really don't like it when the other bf's and gf's get into the child's case.Their only interested in whats best for the child.|`|AKkfepINaa	I think that you should stay out of it because I think that she has a motive for talking to you! You have to be careful about what you say to her because I know that U are with him but does he know that you guys are talking and what is going on between you. I had a similar situation with an ex and I finally realized I had to stay out of the middle because it might get u 2 into a fight or them . Just be really careful because she will act like your friend then do something to make things worse. I think court is the best way! You have to think what happens when they get into a fight again a year or 2 later and this happens all over again. If u get it on paper it is always the best then no one can break the court document! good luck but from past experience dont get to close and get it in writing...|`|NDpO8hX4aa	this is a funny situation cause we just went trough the same ****. she cant deny visitation for one thing if he is on the birth certificate and there is no parenting plan he can keep her for as long as he wants until a court date and police can not get involved because he is the father and until the court says their is and different the law states that either parent has 100 % custody. that means neither one can fight who has her until the judge says so. so get down and sign up with legal aid and they will give u a lawyer for pro-bonal and go get her to bring the baby for a visit a leave will her and make leave if she doesnt have the cops make her leave and tell them u are going through legal services and r waiting for court for a parenting plan and ur daughter is staying with u.do it asap.LEGAL SERVICES   TIME IS THE KEY TO THE WHO GETS THE PAPERS TO THE COURTS FIRST. parenting plans can also be downloaded off line and summitted to courts for like $100 this cheap.usually whoever gets theirs in first the judge goes for.....|`|SckWdjnVaa	You should try reasoning it with her on a woman-to woman level...no point just beating round the bush !!! Wat more troubles could you land up into???<br>  <br>  For all you know....she could be friendly with u only to know how u r doing with her ex-hubby !!!
6p6JB09laa	it seems you're pursuing him, why does/would he have to do much if you're doing it all or most of it. most guys wouldn't ..<br>  he's lazy and basically a loser it sounds like..<br>  you need to re-evaluate all this and do what you feel is best for you, all of the inner you,  n the long run..<br>  be with a lazy loser boy or have a real great exciting vivacious guy & life and all YOU want out of life...<br>  not to be walking around confused all the rest of your days...<br>  always your choice..|`|aWaakM8baa	Well really you can't look on this website to know what to do. If I were you I would text him and be like can we meet up I gotta talk to you about something, if he says no just talk to him through texting then, but when you do talk ask him what is going on. You don't seen to be a booty call at all because a booty call is when you call someone over late hours of the night just to have sex and don't contact them otherwise. So you aren't a booty call, but he could be using you. I really don't think he is! But you have to work it out with him to know the truth.|`|PU0wfROvaa	Open up and tell him you're interested in him (if you are).<br>  <br>  Us guys get nervous if a) language is a barrier and b) we are interested in you. We're also quite dense sometimes, so you might have to present it up front to him exactly how you feel.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	You have a crazy spirit and thoughts, lucky him having u there beside him<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|R7q9BLuBaa	Hey Crazy girl, <br>  I can see you in the same situation that my GF was in about a year ago and I will tell you how everything turned out to be great! First of all, she has this rule that you can show some skin on the upper body or lower body, but never both. stilettos are a bit too much if you're gong out, wear some lower heels or maybe platforms with heels, no boots please even tough I like the way kne high boots look they will destroy the schoolgirl look. My Gf has some black leather shoes with platform in the botton, for me they are the best ones! you should start with some plain white or white with black stripes on the top thigh high socks, black ones area also ok. Have you taught into getting some Argyle pattern ones? the skirt doesn't have to be short!!! but it does have to be pladed preferably. get a skirt platted or something that is close to be schoolgirlishhh. at the top try different combination of shirts, pretty much whatever matches your skirt and socks. you MUST do your hair nicely, all other accesories are extra but don't put in too much of them. I'd like to know what kind of clothes/shoes/socks you have so I can better assist you. Things have worked out great for use and it can also work great for you two. mixing the right ingredients will get you where you want to stand. get back at me and maybe I can help you. <br>  -A friend|`|yyJo3ybBaa	I'd need to see a pic of you in the outfit to tell you where its safe to go. You obviously want attention, just gotta be sure you get the right KIND of attention.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	wow-you sound like a blast!!you dont plan to do this in the town you live in do you?lol|`|m0WUEtqXaa	LOL....get some girlfriends to help you on this one
ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	If you live in the US, no, he won’t get out of paying child support. He has voluntarily--not once, but twice--acknowledged that he’s the father.  No court in the US would now allow him to disestablish paternity, because he’s missed his opportunity to do that.<br>  <br>  Do I think it's crappy that the ex did this to him?  Yes. But he allowed it, so the situation he's in now in is of his own making.<br>  <br>  Stop encouraging him in this, and for God sake, don’t hold it against the child, who’s the innocent party here.|`|tZUSVuUvaa	You need to check with a lawyer, I think the rules can be different depending on the state. I know that if a man is married to a woman when the child is born, he will still have to pay child support even if the child is later proven to be fathered by another man. (Incredibly unfair, but it happens). I'm not sure if the same would apply because he's signed the birth certificate. I think that is considered an admission by the father that he is going to step up and claim the child whether biologically his or not, but I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  What a bad situation. Have him get that paternity test asap.|`|631c5a7637b452713613c313a27eec7daa	my bro in law found out that all 3 of his kids werent really his.. cheatin ex sis in law!   BUT his name was on the birth certificate and even after going to court he still has to pay child support. i think that the lawyer said he could attempt to reliquish his parental rights. you could try this. good luck, my bro in law works just to pay child support on 3 kids that arent even his right now! it sucks!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You do not have conclusive evidence that the child is not his... probably need to do what the court suggested and have the DNA testing done where ever the courts indicate you  need to go.|`|sBvS9FSiaa	Normally when you sign the birth certificate that's it but the judge gave him a second chance by ordering the DNA test. When he blew it off he more then likely blew off his last chance of not paying child support even if the child's not his.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The courts could take the easy way out here and they usually do by making him to continue to pay as theyll say he signed the birth certificate and thats good enough for them whe indeed an injustice is being done here. Especially if it can be prove hes not the father. But the cours hate to over rule a prior order when he should have done it when things first began. So even with the paterna test toprove it, you may have a hell of a time to getting it overturned.You could get an attorney that will fight for you but it could get costly with no guarantee of winning. Sorry and goodluck|`|XSBIQ5M9aa	sometimes even if its not his, its hard to take him off child support if he signed the birth certificate - but they would ask, if he knew upfront that there was a chance he wasnt the father|`|YyP5tarFaa	He has "guilt fellings" for the child but if it is not his son then he isn't resopnsible for child support.
3DF7X1mhaa	I am so sorry that you had to lose some one so close to you in such a tragic way. Honestly, I dont know the answer to this question. If I may draw from a personal experience. My aunt committed suicide this past August and there is not a day that goes by that I do not think of her. I keep rethinking the weeks leading up to her death and try to figure out what could I have done, what could I have said, just to change her mind, to stop her etc. It truly haunts me and I think it will until the day my eyes close. <br>  <br>  I cant say that your feelings will ever go away completely. The only advice that I can give is to try to come to peace with the situation, try to remove any quilt that you have surrounding the situation. <br>  <br>  I am keeping you in my prayers, I know I probably was not very helpful but I just wanted to let you know you are not alone.|`|8zgFyfibaa	I'm not trying to disrespect ok. But are you a chola or used to be one because your nickname m.tiny right and u have the 3 puntos meaning my crazy life and I right?<br>  <br>  Anyways I'm sorry for your loss and just keep your head up your bestfriend is in heaven looking down on you and protecting you.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	the heavens decide when you live and when you die<br>  <br>  i dont believe in any of the religious stuff but that i believe.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	If this is affecting your life, maybe you could consider a grief counseling group, or even look into grief forums on the internet?  Talking about your feelings of sadness, anger or whatever you feel about your friend's death might take a big load off your shoulders... it could help.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're having such issues...|`|415g0c9saa	Sorry abt ur frend......no1s here to stay<br>  <br>  it depends on how much u love him......hes ur best frend,so i think it wont go away so easily<br>  <br>  Try finding urself a companion.......that might take it away a lil bit<br>  <br>  good day|`|f48277b0eedf18349f408b252bd473a1aa	When you lose someone so close to you, it always hurts, i am deeply sorry for your loss, sorry isn't even enough to describe it.. Grieve in your own way, but don't get stuck in the past, live life and be happy, it's your right to be happy, he would want that wouldn't he?  There is no right or wrong way to deal with these feelings really, i can relate.  Think of the happy times you had with him, be thankful you had a lot of happy years with him.  Keep your head up, what's done is done, don't stress yourself more by worrying about things you have no control over and can't change.  Best of luck to you, just know your not in this alone.  Talking with someone is always helpful

Oi5yTtcvaa	when we face then end of life, (We will be ready), our jorneys to get to heaven is needed. god comes to us and takes our soul's hand and just picks us up to heaven. its not suffering and gagging for peaceful deaths but just a gentle tug into heaven. our wifes/husbands will die AFTER, and we will wait for them in heaven until its THEIR time to stop living. and god will do the same with them and pull them up into heaven. WE WILL NOT, NOT SEE THEM EVER AGAIIN, but we won't see them for a couple more years until THEY pass away. so, we just part ways a short time, not forever. thanks!|`|ixmaM395aa	Other than a piece of paper that legally declares you a couple what else is a marriage?<br>  <br>  It's a fairytale. A day where everything must be & is perfect. Perfect bride, perfect groom, perfect couple. But reality is that couples fight. If they didn't fight it would be inhuman. So along with the fairytale comes the fairytale lyrics. <br>  <br>  I highly doubt many of those people who stand up at the altar & say their vows actually meant it. They're just going along with the story.|`|PdOrdmvcaa	Dead Broke ............is no kind of Marriage.........So yeah divorce before it gets that way is a good option.<br>  <br>  If you are really smart you will never get married.<br>  <br>  You can do everything married people do without being married , and if the time comes you want to leave each other is very easy to just walk away.<br>  <br>  Marrige court can make you go to counseling and you have to pay for it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the judge wont allow a divorce and will make you stay married ............So yeah just skip the marriage part and keep your money|`|1vi7PX0Faa	You are definitely right.

When people get divorces that means that they weren't supposed to be in a relationship and saying "till death do us part" wasn't something they really meant....maybe at the time, but they should have waited.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	I wouldn't know the exact meaning...but a lot of the times we have great intentions and say things that we intend to do....<br>  <br>  However, only God knows which promises you can and you can't keep. You just have to have the right intentions and be good at heart.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped. Take care, smile and enjoy life.|`|UCPY4AtUaa	Not every couple says that vow now & I always remember that vow when an ex-spouse kills the other one, so some keep that vow.<br>  <br>  With the serial monogamy we have today, we might as well have renewable contracts that are 2 years, max.|`|m0WUEtqXaa	I Think most people mean that when they say it, they aren't fully aware of the extent of pain, and difficulty what these circumstances bring, unfortunately keeping your word is something that has lost its worth theses days, its easier not to.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	i think it's figurative.. to be there for one another in this life.. once you're dead you can't really support each other....that has to do with spirituality of it. so no you don't have to.. i guess|`|o6orgXm2aa	Mate as soon as you get married you might Aswell be dead.|`|tLuQNoP2aa	that's like saying yes to "do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but..."|`|TB8rfMrHaa	The reason we say "'til death us do part" is because we go into marriage, supposedly making a covenant between the Bride, Groom, and the Lord.  God's word says that what God joins, let no man separate, and that the two shall become one flesh.  How can you divide something that has become one flesh?<br>  Very few people go into marriage thinking it will end in divorce, but they also think that if things go badly divorce is definitely an option.  If you never allow divorce to enter your mind as an option.  Your marriage cannot end unless your partner ends it!  Besides this, people are far too willing to marry someone that they had no business marrying in the first place!  <br>  We are very choosy about our house/apt., our clothes, friends, hair, even what type of cell phone we are willing to carry.  We are not near so choosy about picking the person that we are supposed to spend the rest of our lives with!<br>  No one wants to work for anything, anymore!  Instant gratification/throw away society.  If someone no longer suits our taste then we just dump them and try on someone new, for size.  Marriage is hard work . . . even when everyone works at it.  If nobody is working at it and everyone is demanding their own way . . . it will fail every time.<br>  <br>  Our society says love demands what we want, throws temper tantrums when we don't get our way, and that our partner should give in to us at all costs!<br>  God's Word defines love very differently!<br>  Love is patient. Love is kind. Love isn't jealous. It doesn't sing its own praises. It isn't arrogant.|`|xrq4qKRbaa	When you say this things it's supposed to be a life long commitment.<br>  No matter what happens you are to work at it. In these time Divorce is seen more as a cop out. The easy way out for the lazy person. If yo loved the person enough to marry them with a life long commitment and the love get foggy lets say. You work on it to fix it and find that love that brought the two of you together. The vowels if taken to heart one won't let it get that far. Till death do us part means just that death to us not till the marriage dies. Till you physically die, dead, kaput.live no more, don't breath, ETC|`|TkPJYlaMaa	Yes, in the original vows, it does say 'til death do us part', but things have changed. Sadly, those sacred vows no longer mean the same as they did back then. True though, at the time of the vows, the two may really mean it, but .....well we've watched tv, heard the news, listened to our neighbors fighting each other at 3'o clock in the morning. Also......most people either prefer death to divorce or find it as the same thing. *shrugs*|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	I see that people think that it is funny or nothing at all to make a vow to God and then break it. I think that everyone should be counseled before they make that vow. Its funny how some people say that when they pray to God they never get an answer. And then they say that God must not care or doesn't really exist. But it seems to be OK to make a vow to God that they want to get married and they will stay together untill death. What a big lie. Is it OK to lie to God. No it is not. Everyone makes a big joke about it.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	most people don't value the words they say. they are so caught up in all the drama (of the wedding) that the very point becomes meaningless. people should just live together if the words don't truly have importance to them. they cam lower legal costs and their apparent stress. when "having" to say those words (and mean it) are a chore, marriage is NOT for you.|`|zka26204aa	I guess divorce is preferable to death!!|`|lCPeEvfNaa	only words man

a6ad4c43f1d38c63f2a31b8143d57098aa	just  bite the bullet and ask. nothing ventured nothing gained. there are so many things to do there. maybe you could compromise.. if they insist on staying together..waterpark one day, ducks or min. golfing another. you don't say how old you are, or whether they might let you and your cousin double up to do something together. good luck|`|AA11848886	When you open your mouth and make a sort of humming noise you should make a sound called "Words" These are what make us communicate with other humans.|`|f00faf9677552b0669a82a7551de4655aa	well just tell ur parents that u don't want 2 go <br>  or tell them u have plans with ur freinds|`|790bac75f36724095c24fb91c7a1d641aa	LOL!

3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	Misunderstood. Sorry about the Avatar thing people seem to get hung up on that for some reason. I knew a girl who was a cutter. Because I was crazy I didn't know it had something to do with me. I can't explain why. I suppose it's because there is a secret they can't share with others. Abuse or rejection(love). I don't know your story though. The reason may have something to do with tattoos and piercings like  emotional battle scars or something. I'm just relating to one girl though. The world is crazy. You won't let people send you messages?|`|a6ad4c43f1d38c63f2a31b8143d57098aa	perhaps not  "crazy", but it certainly isn't a sign of "good" mental health.|`|14770b85d01ee213e06c77a050a24fd9aa	maybe not crazy but they should definetly get some kind of psychiatrist help or something like tht

ffc7189a6226289a417a9854151d0836aa	In the future never leave with a stranger, especially in a bar.  They've been drinking, looking at women in tight dresses, probably dancing and trying to get free feels, and horny.  Most of the time you'll never meet a potential husband in a club.  They're  at the club to have a good time.  That's a dangerous situation, I'd be pissed o..touching on your private parts...no no no.  He sounds like a person that could be a potential rapist, he touched on your body without your permsision.  Didn't know anything about...you don't want to endanger yourself.  <br>  <br>  All men do not pressure women into having sex.  Only the self-absorbed  buttholes, that's thinking about their crouch.  <br>  <br>  In a situation like that, I'd would have told him "It's time to for me to go", and would have been rigid in saying it.  He doesn't have respect for a woman or their body, and has been watching Jerry Springer too much.|`|767734fb41d5702f4701fd5ea3bb0a06aa	hit in the private area.|`|76fd4e4e7a646f5cdc33a2b90d9377ddaa	First of all the marjority of the men in a club want sex...... they only get as fars as you let them.... Leaving with him not cool that just showed you are easy..the chances of finding a man without these thoughts its 1 out of 50 at a club...never take a man home from a club..... if you manage to make it home without being harmed thank God If you told him No thats rape but if you just sat their you just proved him right your easy.....|`|aabe1f7e02835c629f8bdfb0b16b9646aa	Report sexual abuse.  Post him as a sex offender wherever you can.  Warn your friends|`|ad56a55925cde28a458d2c39a145f705aa	Stick with your answer of no..Dont give into him..All men think with there dicks...Missy|`|d1768fa54ecaf2b90c59a4ce0a6c8b7daa	smack him in the face then if he don't stop knee him in the balls no means no
4f5df07e4d713840621ae192b88457b2aa	i think he might have a thing for you...i mean, you know how her girlfriend and him go on and off? i mean , hes probably looking to get away from her....and looking for being with u in the near future.... do u remember how u told me he always says these things to you? well, he is doing it so you will like him and after you do, he might say something....but just to make sure, you should tell him how you feel attracted to him...|`|4d723350426fb5c607f5977c8181cd39aa	Hello<br>  <br>  <br>  It is always tuff to try to guess what  a guy may be thinking <br>  <br>  <br>  I have learned after a long time that the best way to find that out is to just ask that person <br>  <br>  <br>  that is the only way that you are going to know for sure|`|64c80a8f7ff4601e85431165d66dce7caa	he likes you or he hates you so much he is trying to make you do something stupid<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|aabe1f7e02835c629f8bdfb0b16b9646aa	Watch out.  This guy is looking for sex!  He doesn't like you for who you are, he wants your body.  Run!|`|0e6edf0c5df16a321a94c88961411caaaa	If you want to know, just flirt back a bit and see the results. After that just flat out ask, "Okay, so you have a girl. What are you trying to do? Do you like me?"|`|abbee72ea522461f439aec8922be8fb3aa	yes i fully believe he likes you and if you like him as much as you sound like you do, flirt with him and dress to impress hun. girly, then if he breaks up with her then he totally likes you and you should go for it!!! Believe me it works!!!!!!!!|`|eb325b4d41898bafd29549810660cb34aa	he probably likes u|`|AA11149006	sounds gross to me|`|bf344be07842394bd90827504828f421aa	If you're in high school, then I would say that the guy knows  you like him, and just likes playing mind games with you.  Also, he could be trying to make his girlfriend jealous.  Unless he gives you a whole candy cane with a note, don't think twice about it.
bc1f1df224517fc591a4310fcb815c16aa	As long as you are of age and make them aware of the situation,  I don't see anything wrong with it.  Still you should be certain or at least cognizance that some men don't want anyone else to enjoy what they think or believe is theirs, even it they'd expressed that didn't want to be involved anymore.|`|430740a762048201b7758ea7d4ee4f8faa	If your baby's father doesn't want anything do with you and your baby than i do not see anything wrong with you moving on with your life and finding someone else.|`|59f51e9ae11d545ac39592da46b9c65faa	Absolutely fine!!! Go ahead!! I would o the same thing, you must go on with your life while the father grows up... and i promisse... they do it very slowly!!!|`|AA10554774	Okay if you are pregnant then why are you only worrying about the guys? You should probably focus on the point that you are going to have a baby soon...this is isn't even probably a real problem you probably just made it up.|`|aabe1f7e02835c629f8bdfb0b16b9646aa	Yea.  Right now it would be good to culminate a good friend that is a young man.  You want your child to some day have a masculine influence.  Find out who that guy should be now.|`|cafc8ed9ff386f13997c53e66ec8dfd6aa	It depends on your age. Like, if you are a teenager or something, no, you shouldn't date around.<br>  But if the guy is that much of a jerk about it, forget about it. He isn't good enough to father your child.<br>  If you are an adult, then sure. If a guy really likes you, he will date you because of you, and won't care if you're pregnant or not.|`|cdf4bcdda8484b2b7ba0a94ddaaf4aa7aa	of course it is! it seems like the father is some arrogant b a s t a r d and should have stayed with you through this! find somebody who is going to love you and the baby and care for you two, you don't need some type of 1 hit guy around! go out and find yourself a sweetheart, <br>  <3 good luck!|`|e52c539e0df5381d9f76d66a59831c54aa	Don't you have enough problems already.  Chill for a while, have the baby.   Just tell them to call you in about 5 months, right now you are emotionally vulnerable.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Not while you're pregnant.|`|0dcd33eea2559058152d4045b222a6c1aa	i guess its too late to take pills?|`|5ab728b848451de8be1aefb580dae3caaa	Its perfectly fine, have a party :]  If the father of your baby wants nothing to do with your kid and your not involved with him, go ahead, your not breaking any unwritten rules.|`|99bb67e918b600a32b783d7083a3f068aa	Of course. But remember not to stress it's bad for the baby. I hope you find happiness! =]]|`|AA10129507	Are you guys married? cuz if your legally married then it would be alittle awkward. You might wanna talk with the father about it. If he's those type of I-don't-care-what-you-do-leave-me-alone. type guys then I guess you could. But it might be awkward for the guy your dating to be with you.|`|b559b766e4b2f90e096bcbba7a0bbd53aa	Who would date a girl that is 5 months pregnant?<br>  You need to take care of yourself and that baby and forget about the guys for awhile!!
566c385445a33f5a84d74cc8e294226eaa	There's love in the air. Give him a real chance.|`|227155c0c9b04760c952d1873fd00a3aaa	You have introduced sex into the relationship, which changes everything.  Now the feelings come out.  You feel jealous because you now think that he belongs to you.  Learn from this:  don't blur the lines between friend and lover, it's never as easy as it sounds.|`|aabe1f7e02835c629f8bdfb0b16b9646aa	You gave him too much.  He now expects it of you.  The sex drive in a guy can make him a real jerk until he gets fulfilled.  Animals do the same thing.  They'll go insane until they can *** a female.|`|561a1438064bf8309a42277784d06d0aaa	You have to talk to him and see what he is thinking you likely just have a missunderstaning of the situation. Then together you two should discuss what you want. That way you wil know how he feels and also you will be able to express your feelings
f24090e6dd5d398ddd6118aa06755a06aa	This is totallly depends on u and the whole situation surrounding u. So, be brave first of all u have to know what is his /her feelings about u, what he/she like. Find a good moment when he/she in good mood with u and tell calmly everything and don't forget if yr expectation will be negetive then don't do anything wrong behave with him/her. I think if he/she is a open minded as well as lovely then accept u. Best of luck.|`|0a4d6fbabe37a9431e3071171252e7e7aa	well tell him in private not in public|`|7d1d6b5640d0c2f9fb1afa406d4a8ce0aa	Hmmm.  If you feel he has some interest in you?  You could just talk to him and let things build up from there and let your body language do the talking.  Subtle body language hints can mean far more than words and this has been proven.<br>  <br>  It builds a LOT of .....um....sexual tension.  I don't mean act like a tart, but just keep the hint of shyness, but look at him and if he catches you looking, look down and smile slightly.  TRUST ME, HE'LL KNOW.|`|94b8a00372ecfdcbb075bcfbed40af59aa	God has made something called MOUTH which has a tongue!!!<br>  Use it !!!!|`|e89249d08f074b9de1aad24e6c2228e4aa	Its different for girls.

If anyone lies or cheats on you, you should get out of that relationship immediately. There is absolutely no excuse for that, and you will never be able to have a truly happy and successful relationship with that person. I know it can be hard...but there is always someone else out there. I have learned this. I have had failed relationships, and every time I have been able to find someone better. <br>  <br>  Don't ever cheat on them if they cheat on you. Just end the relationship. If you cheat on them, it makes you no better than they are. <br>  <br>  If they lie or cheat on you, don't let them make you think you are the bad one. That is wrong. Get out of the relationship and don't look back. <br>  <br>  The right guy would not lie, or cheat on you. He would be open and honest, even if it something you may not want to hear. My bf is like that, he is the first guy I have ever really trusted, and it makes for a much better and happier relationship. I trust him because he will tell me things that are true, that I may not want to hear. If we argue, he may have to leave to cool off, but then he will come and tell me why he is angry with me, and tries to understand where I am coming from. It is the best feeling in the world when you are with someone you can trust.<br>  <br>  Don't change yourself to be what you think a bf might want. (Well, unless it is a bad characteristic like selfishness or something). Be yourself.

She may have been flirting with one or both of the guys. Or they may have been flirting with her and she never has wanted to tell you. Either way I wouldn't really trust her. Why aren't you married to this girl? You have been with her for 7 (whole years!). That's a long time. Actually, if you think about it, you may not want to marry her. It may ruin the whole relationship. Either the case, the answer to you question lies upon what has been communicated between her and the 2 guys. And FYI....Don't trust your friends so much....especially the ones you think you can trust the most. And if your best friend did actually try to hit on your girl and she never brought it up, you need to leave her and discontinue your friendship with your so-called friend.
zj9kKyg3aa	To them you still are, and you always will be. My mom used to be the same, but now she backed off. This is what you do.<br>  <br>  Sit down with her. Tell her you're growing up and you need to keep trying to handle things on your own so you can learn from the mistakes you will make. And once in a while, let her in your life and tell her if there is anything wrong. Since i'm a boy, my mom knows i can handle things, and because i am mature for my age. I'm 16 by the way. Tell her you don't want to be treated like a baby anymore because you're not. And if she keeps doing this you might end up always depending on someone, won't get up on your feet on your own without depending on someone.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later she will realize that you're right and she should back off a little.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|c8cc493f6fe072c78e488d929a13434daa	because she is being protective and doesnt want you to look too grown up going out so you dont get in with a boy|`|865f900aac43f0954c36406292c7c675aa	We are the ones who determine how others will treat us.  If you are being treated like a baby then try doing adult things that show you have responsibility and maturity.  Being mature then brings about mature treatment.  <br>  <br>  The fun part is you can be treated however YOU want if you simply choose to have people treat you respectfully.  Be respectful and you will be asking for that treatment as well.<br>  <br>  : )  Keep your head up and go talk to your mom....  If she will not listen to a mature approach then limit time with her and move on as soon as you hit 18.

ANd if you guys do, if he flirts with you and tickles you and stuff then yeah he wants to hang out with you|`|1cc28863df342763be12d79124e0660aaa	Depends what happens when you hang out... Try talking instead of txting. Texts can be used to hide real intentions.|`|ee3914abff1bda85d7257fef7b0b5141aa	Probably not. Just misses the poo tang baby|`|TQGBDboUaa	No, not with you.|`|4454ad648eda4178d3694de44d3f8c1daa	Yes probably it does or he may want something else. But i suggest not going if hes your ex because theres a reason why hes your ex. Unless he has proven himself different and able to accept and handle your relationship together. Dont go unless this is true!
8ffcc19c32aa8bd69600dd3d5c6120caaa	Ok love sadly i know what your going through because i did the same thing and the one thing i regret doing was not telling her how much i loved her and how sorry i was for making her wait.<br>  But you need to tell him how you truly feel before its too late|`|4454ad648eda4178d3694de44d3f8c1daa	Run up to him and apologize for everything you really like him and beg him to be your b/f so that you can make things right. Please do this you do like him and you wanted him as a boyfriend and hes almost gone get him before its too late!
fOhebsPAaa	Give her time to see the sincereity in you..

I mean it not like your planning to get married rite|`|DevoV7oOaa	What about you??do u have feelings for her??If yes, than tell her you like her too...<br>  Wait for signs and than ask her out..|`|p1s8v0Zhaa	wow. ok trust me..i probably feel the same way as her right now..or did neway. but ask her out she wants you too. If she likes you as much as you think she does then she is thinking right now that she wants another chance at relationships and is hoping that you give it to her. She is going to try and keep it going and you can help her with it. But if you do go out and you can see its not working..don't give up try to work it out with her but if she still isn't there with you, then mayb she isnt ready for a relationship yet. Bare with her is all I can say. Good luck though! But if you don't ask her she will get aggravated and angry and so will you. If you do though, you can never say you never tried. Try it though mayb she is ready to give it a go for real this time.
NaSdn34zaa	You won't. The trust has been violated, and you will never fully have it back again. You might want to consider not even trying to get over it, and drop him like a bad habit. If he truly loved you, and respected you, he would never have even come close to cheating on you. I guess you need to ask yourself if you are strong enough of a person to walk away from him, and stand up for yourself. If he gets away with it, and you let it go, what is to stop him from doing it again? And again? Find a man that will not do it in the first place. Good Luck!|`|a3561656dd695e772a873dffcb7cdf66aa	i personally would not be able to get over that sort of betrayal even if it was only one night. my trust in him would be completely shattered and I would always suspect him of wanting to do it again. <br>  the only way it might even be possible in my eyes is if you two were on "a break".|`|hnNjxFjbaa	You prob won't. Your trust is broken. You might have to keep reminding yourself that you forgave him whenever those feeling arise. But as long as you're still in the relationship, you may never look pass it. Good luck!|`|4454ad648eda4178d3694de44d3f8c1daa	Honestly it is impossible unless he is really actually sorry. If he actually makes a very strong effort to let you know that he loves you and would never do it again then yes you can get over it. But its going to take a lot of work cause it hurts bad very bad. If you cant get over it eventually you may need to take a break and see how things work out that way. I wish you the best luck with this.|`|80352a7ce77f4940d86d7667908ebed0aa	im sorry for this but, you are the messed up one here. now i think cheating is wrong, but because you are still there tells me that you let him get away with it you should of left and never looked back. if you did he would still be asking you to take him back.|`|LZC8ycpxaa	Either forgive him or leave.

iS5SDgvpaa	People always say that its not whats on the outside but what is inside. Those people are full of sh*t. First of all (male or female) if you are out in public you are not normally going to see someone who weighs 400 pounds, hasnt shaved in 6 months, smells like rotton eggs, looks like they washed their hair in a tub of lard, and has boogers hanging out if there nose, and actually find this person attractive, are you? Ok so all I am saying is that everyone has something that they look for in the opposite sex, this may not be the same thing for everyone, but in general most females like someone who cares about their appearance and has some self confidence. If I were attracted to someone that I saw out, then I would at least smile, maybe say hello and see what happens, it only takes a second to tell if someone is interested.

Agora n?o se sinta suja, pois como eu disse, quando o nosso relacionamento n?o vai bem,  só escutamos desaforo em casa e ai aparece uma pessoa carinhosa, compreensiva que fala tudo aquilo que queremos ouvir, ai já era, é trai??o na certa, fa?a o te tiver vontade,  espero  que dê tudo certo e que vc seja muito feliz.|`|82b97d699c248d019613b151b4445451aa	o tempo ajuda vc a esquecer isso, se vc contar pro seu marido  ele dificilmente perdoará, mas aproveite para melhorar seu casamento, trate seu marido com mais carinho. ... veja pelo lado de que agora vcs ir?o viver melhor. ...|`|921b190d7f193053390f3ee74ae58c23aa	Diga a ele.

Deixa seu marido ir embora e lhe deseje boa sorte. é melhor que cada um va para o seu canto cuidar da sua vida.<br>  Entenda que seu marido nao te ama mais, aposto que nao tava nem ligando pra vc, por isso teve que dar um apulada de cerca.<br>  N?o aprovo o que vc fez.

Ofere?a a ele o dinheiro do ?nibus ou do táxi se ele n?o tiver carro, e se tiver carro dê a ele o dinheiro da gasolina pra que possa ir embora o mais rápido possível.

Simplesmente poupe-o de uma série de trai??es que acontecer?o futuramente se ele continuar contigo, pois o difícil é a primeira trai??o; passou por esta, fica o peso na consciência que com o tempo passa, o resto fica mais fácil e cada vez menos dolorida. Maldita a mulher ( ou homem ) que tendo "as coisas" dentro de casa procura experimentar as de fora. O castigo? N?o parar mais, e conseguir um companheiro que fa?a o mesmo, e neste caso, como mais um castigo pra vc, a trai??o dele vai doer mais em vc do que a sua trai??o nele e, esta invers?o de valores pode até resultar em morte no final.

It hurts that the trust is gone .

If hes gonna cheat, hes gonna cheat. You just need to make sure you are a good judge of character. I spose if it were me I would just watch him like a hawk. Dont let him see you though. When hes talking to other girls/friends watch his body language and listen to his conversation. If he is suggestive or flirty, DONT GO THERE. if a pretty girl walks past and he turns around to gawk...dont go there. if hes inconsiderate enough to do it front of you, he'll probably do it more when you arent with him. Thats a basic hint. Some guys are a lot more deviate. You may never know.....Just got to use that 'womens intuitive' I guess. Also....love doesnt happen overnight. he may be wondering the same thing about you. If hes a really open and talkative guy thats good.

Your looking for a casual way to tell her how you feel. I have found the best way is ; if she is a girl that talks to you(comfortably, as in she trusts you) then that is a good step in the right direction! when she mentions anything about an ex boyfriend or another guy, say I could treat you better than that! You deserve more! Let her know in a casual way, that you can be what she is looking for "without looking desperate". Give her a little and then take a little away! If you give it all up at once then the game is over. I dont like to look at it as a game, but seriously it really is how she perceives you. act confident and secure then that tells her that you are not needy. Give her a little and do not reveal everything you leave her wanting more! same goes visa versa!|`|ptfKE8zJaa	Well talk to her alot, but not too too much, and see what shes into her past times and like all her favorite things. Then hug her every once in a while and then take it up a notch to hugging her whenever you see her. When you do talk to her smile a little and just be interested in what she talking about.

Then tell her how you feel or just ask her if she will go on a date with you. BUT NEVER SAY ANY CHEESY PICKUP LINES! Like never say this one YOU KNOW WHAT?

du5MNrQ6aa	A 23 year old, whether it be a male/female, needs privacy from their parents. You can tell them things, but you are an adult now, it's time to have your own life.

You are 23 for christ sakes you deserve to live your life and not have your mother still watching over your back. It is also important to remember that mothers have strong nurturing instincts so somthing must replace you at this point and time and nothing has yet som they may be the stem as to why she is heavily intrusive on your life|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	I solved this problem the fun way...

If you live on your own, then you need to smile and say "sure mom" and then decide what she needs to know and what she doesn't need to know.|`|AA10075228	Yes you should have your own privacy at your age.  As long as you are living by yourself, and are taking care of your own bills, it is time you just told your Mum that you do not intend telling her everything you do.  Or the best way is to just not tell her everything, you are a grown man and need to set boundaries with everyone.
DZkkYK0Baa	It's hard to say, really. I'm in a similar situation, except I'm the girl. I'm pretending to be happy and that I don't love my ex anymore, though it's not true. I'm trying to get over him by lying to myself and everyone else when I say that I'm over him and that I'm happy. She could be doing the same thing. I find it hard to believe that she could just suddenly be over you that fast, after two years. Is she with someone else? Another boyfriend could help speed up the moving on process but I just can't see that she'd be over you so quickly, unless she was over you long ago while you were still dating. <br>  <br>  Though, I don't think she'd say that to make you jealous. I think if she wanted to make you jealous, she'd date someone else. You really never know. She might even be wanting you to move on as well as herself. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you to just move on, because that's stupid. You can't just tell someone to move on and have them magically move on. Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way. But, if you still have feelings for her and would like to get back together, stick around, but don't hover. If she still has feelings for you (which my guess is that she does), she may end up returning to you. I have an ex who I left like two years ago and he's still hanging around. I actually kind of like it. In my eyes, it shows dedication and that he's serious about me. If he didn't creep me out and if I could trust him more, I would take him back. But maybe that's just me.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Why thinking and wasting time on the past things, just look after yrself and be happier and better.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|zka26204aa	She was only infatuated, and is over it.|`|CxhH2xSQaa	Girls do play games...especially if they are younger and immature but here are the obvious options:<br>  <br>  a. she truly doesn't give a crap and she's over it and happier without you<br>  b. she thinks she's over it but it's really because she has this new guy who is making her feel better about being single...she has an option and (most likely) he will slowly take your place and you will be left in the dust even if she has lingering feelings...he will just take over all that crap..him or whoever else.<br>  c. she may be trying to make you jealous and trying to get you to come guns blazing back to her making grand gestures.

(God) formed the female that way. Human beings procreate because of the attraction between male and female. A woman that covers herself is not trying to attract a man on base principles. Women have had enough of men being attracted to them because of the beauty of their forms, face and hair rather than the  intelligence of a creature of God that He created for a serious purpose.  The Old Testament says, “A virtuous woman is more precious than silver and gold.” <br>  <br>  No man strikes his wife. How are you going to beat the woman that produces your future? Men should be ashamed to abuse women, but most men who beat and bruise women, yet want sex with them the same night they beat them. Men want to beat women like they are inanimate objects, like trees or a lamppost that a dog will lift its leg to; like women do not have feelings. <br>  <br>  Do you think after you beat up a woman that she really wants to give herself to you? Why would you want to take pleasure from someone to whom you have given so much pain? <br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of  (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.”It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again. <br>  <br>  It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building. Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come. <br>  <br>   We must treat women with the greatest of respect and honor believing that they are sacred. The female, believing that she is sacred, should never allow herself to be violated, disrespected, and dishonored and, must never violate and dishonor herself.<br>  <br>  You are not the woman of man; you are the woman of God. The more men grow to reflect God, then the hearts of women will calm down and you will be more at peace. What is the nature of the woman and what is the nature of the man? The Holy Qur’an and Bible says, “Men are the maintainers of women.” It is the natural role of a man to work hard and produce what is necessary to maintain a woman and the children that are produced from that woman. As a maintainer, he is a protector, provider, and he is supposed to guide. <br>  <br>  Mens cannot guide a woman just with sex, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female, then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. Guidance comes from the brain, not from any other part of the body. <br>  <br>  Guidance must manifest wisdom and since you are the Second Self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God.<br>  <br>  In Holy Quran and Bible, a woman is three-times the value of a man, because she brings forth life. Women teach and train the offspring. So, if you are an ignorant, unlettered and foolish woman, you will make a foolish people(Genetation) , But the scriptures say GOD raise a foolish people or people that lost a knowledge of GOD <br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness. What is LIFE? It is the activity that is in accord with the law under which we are created. LOVE is the creative force out of which life comes. To truly love is to live and to have true life is to exist in true love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.

Its always his way or its no way, and your just stupid if you don't see things his way.<br>  He has managed to drive off all your friends/family, isolating you from any resource/person/support who could help you get out/away from him. He's jealous of any friendship/relationship of yours.<br>  He's extremely controlling of where you go, what you do and who you see, and feels he's justified in that because otherwise you'd make bad choices. He doesn't like you to be anywhere without him, unless he needs some alone time, then you're "clingy" or "insecure" if you want him to stay home.<br>  He controls the money completely, and you have no say.<br>  Whatever you want is frivolous, useless,  or stupid, but whatever he wants is top priority. <br>  He wants you to change things about yourself, to be good enough to be with him. <br>  HE doesn't have to justify anything, but you constantly do.<br>  He puts you down constantly. Its subtle at first, but it gets worse. Like "Do you really think you should do/wear that?" to "you useless fat pig, who'd want that?".<br>  He makes you doubt yourself and your perceptions of the situation. Makes you feel like you are/have the problem, not him.<br>  You live in fear of "setting him off" by doing some/any tiny thing.<br>  Any form of violence, whether directed towards you or not. Like throwing things, breaking your stuff, punching walls/doors, making fists at you, telling you you'd have deserved it if they hit you. <br>  Prolonged name calling or belittling behavior, emotional abuse. <br>  You have to do what he wants - always - to "prove" your love.<br>  He has no trouble with invading your privacy - checking your phone, emails, mail, etc, but if you do it to him, he's all over you for it. <br>  If you see the warning signs, take heed.

Realize that men are taught to take control of every situation and be expected to be held accountable for it later.  Society forgives women and children a hell of a lot easier than a man.  If your priorities and goals are the same, the two of you should get along fine.  Perhaps sometimes he might need to lighten up and sometimes you might need to be a little more serious about issues of disagreement.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	he tells you how to do things all of the time (when you are capable of getting the same results doing things your own way.<br>  <br>  he expects you to stay home all of the time, not have friends.<br>  <br>  tells you how to dress<br>  <br>  tells you how to act<br>  <br>  and most likely puts you down.|`|SckWdjnVaa	When he does not let u decide the smallest of issues (concerning urself), never approves of ur choices or likes, does everything at his ease only... in other words, when he takes over & dictates ur life !!!|`|T0uEBuVmaa	well if any little thing you do is worng nd if he hurts you and hits you or gets into a rage thats usally a sign

fjAdjVhkaa	Maybe he actually liked you and wants to keep his distance. The other thing could be that he is a jerk and you shouldnt bother with him at all. Being popular means nothing, and by the time he realizes that it will be too late and he will have no real friends. Trust me, I know. Confront him about it, and dont be shy, whats the worst that could happen, you guys dont stay friends? If that happens, he wasnt a true friend in the first place, and you sound better than that.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Sorry to know and read that, but this case and other thousands r alike always, lying to get a better life and then when they r stronger and better they throw everything, they deserve that and maybe more, but what can u do now, u dont have anyone, and he is a pro in  fraud as u said, how about asking advice from an attorney and c what they will say? can they help, dont look for revenge now its too late, look after yrself and yr kids.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|SckWdjnVaa	Why dont u go to the local cops & relate the incidents???

My husband use to be a Muslim and I don't know all the Muslim's from other countries but some are nice and some are not. I don't believe if he is acting this way he is being a good Muslim! I have some American Muslim friends and they treat their wives with a lot of respect! I Have also met some Muslim's from Jordan that were not very nice to their wives. I say just leave and dust your self off! You have to worry about your children now, Be strong for them and be independent.. You can do it on your own, you don't need a man but If you want a good one let me know we have plenty of friends! Good luck to you!
56974ae7ea3f00a1ea02ba985f923139aa	Men fall in love just like woman do. Sorry guys time to reveal some secrets. Also we go through the same crazy thoughts women have about love. For example "Does she love me the same way as I love her?" "What if she is not the right one?" etc. The truth is some men have no problems expressing there feelings about love and some men do. Your best choice find a guy who is not afraid to express his true feelings for you.|`|2by2Ujblaa	of course guys can and when it does it hits us like a rock. Also don't believe the bull crap about guys not being able to fall in love before 28, because I'm 18 right now and I've been in love with the same person since I was 16... all guys mature at different rates, and some guys are able to fall in love with a girl sooner than most would think.|`|6p6JB09laa	Yes, they do, once they get to be about 28 or so, not until at least then,  and i'm serious...<br>  one exception, if you meet "the one" at any age, but how do you know she's " the one"?..you don't, until you at least meet and get to know many others..not scrw them...and you can meet others while dating others, right? of course you can there's no law against it that i know of..|`|srAP6Vzvaa	Alpha-Males don't.|`|pwULvwbjaa	Like women do? NOOOO No No No No.|`|pMIGuwEzaa	i try my hardest not to!|`|JajEhcsUaa	I'm a real man, so maybe.|`|pkFkP8g3aa	I fell in love wit my plasma TV and my PS3 so yes it's possible|`|A6deu1DWaa	Most men can fall in love much like women do.  But in our younger years lust will rule over love much of the time.  Men mature in many different ways, and some never mature.  I fell in love and never wanted another, but lost her and now I am lonely.  I do date but the feeling in the heart has not been there yet, maybe someone will come along someday soon.  But yes, some of us men love as deeply as women.|`|OALs77q4aa	I've fallen in love with my best friend. I never think about anyone else, never have even considered pursuing anyone else. She's rejected me many times, even told me it would "never happen." <br>  <br>  I've known her for 2 and a half years, and everyday I miss her more when she's not near me. That, I know, is love. Blind. But love.|`|bf3PzRA9aa	absolutely, I am. It's scary though. Because falling in love with a girl that doesn't love you hurts so much. But, yes, guys are capable to love women until death. Many guys, like me, only seek meaningful relationships that could involve falling in love.|`|lwXGNizGaa	Sigh, we do and it's painful and terrible and overwhelming just like it is for women.|`|i2wzKExlaa	If I knew the answer to that I'd be rich.It would mean we understand how women think.I can love a women till death, I just hope it's the wife.|`|A58ZNvHyaa	Yes we do.  At the moment there is this girl I'm so in love with, I don't know what I would do without her and I would most definitely love her until I die =)|`|U0RtiXleaa	yea we do but we mature slower so it takes us a while to get to that stage....but when we finally do its like were trying to rewrite The Notebook|`|fiT1E4qSaa	Unfortunately :(|`|3EM66IWFaa	why not? I will love my wife till my last breath. she so precious for me.I am loving her from her birth.

But girls always bring up of breaking up|`|hXehbPVqaa	we can only hope most are just assholes|`|ylcYx79Baa	i hope so.|`|OFhCTA6Oaa	yes they do!!|`|lHxEbSVRaa	haha i did|`|xrq4qKRbaa	only the real men do.|`|YtT9uGOSaa	Men are capable of love, but incapable of expressing it as freely as a woman.  Men enjoy being told that they're loved, yet they act as if they're too tough to be romantic and passionate.  When a man finds a woman that he loves, that he really can't imagine life without, he will hold on strong and keep her love close.  A man would die for the woman he truly loves and shower her with not gifts, but time, attention, understanding, and an abundance of reassurance of his love for her.  Men do fall in love and when they do they fall hard and they fight hard to keep it.|`|koXcq0l1aa	Aww, I hope that Elegant finds true love!  He's so sweet.<br>  <br>  But yes, I think that mature men fall in love.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Man im in love rite now but not like a women do sorry|`|ld1vh7nHaa	yeah, but a guy can't do that until he's in his 40's.|`|AA11122150	ofcourse!!
JUjsPvNVaa	DON'T change the bible study thing!!! Be who you are and dont; let anyone change that!! if she's not into that, thats hre problem. But just wait to see what happens. Ask her again somtime. :) i hope everything goes well! God bless!|`|63tch8D5aa	i agree with one one of what those people say,<br>  "shes probaly not religious"<br>  your only telling yourself this "she was busy and I believe her because this girl is a really busy person".<br>  <br>  stop telling yourself that kidd,<br>  stop making excuses for her,<br>  BREAK INTO REALITY.<br>  <br>  <br>  shes not that into you.<br>  <br>  trust me,<br>  move on.|`|42A0cw0Faa	Calm down truly woman aren't are mysterious as you think let her have the time to think about the next time you ask her out. Then is she gives  you the same answer (or around the same) then maybe you should move on. You do not want a person who can not tell you her true feelings.|`|Az9keOz5aa	Well,it kinda sounds like she doesen't know if she wants to go out with you yet,you probably didnt woo her much. Ask her again in a week or so...and I think its awesome that you go to Bible studies,I go to them too.=]|`|AA10108216	It means you left things too open-ended.  If you want to ask her out, ask her out for a specific day...don't leave it up in the air. If she's too busy again....maybe she's just not that into you.|`|FBzdlncBaa	You should have replied, "Well can I grab your number and we might be able to arrange a time?"<br>  <br>  In any case, it sounds fairly promising.|`|j0tPzIuSaa	She just doesn't feel the same way about you as you do about her...simple but sad|`|o6orgXm2aa	I gave all you guys thumbs up.. DOnt us just love me??|`|v2XKMN32aa	Doesn't sound good, don't make excuses for her. I really don't think she's interested. If she was she'd make the time for you trust me. Would you pass up the chance if she asked you for a date regardless if you were busy or not. Maybe you should have said this weekend wanna go to the movies and get her number|`|2t4PRzEQaa	Hmm... she said 'maybe' so it's not a yes or a no. You should invite her to something else rather than a bible study, maybe that's just not her thing. Try asking her out again a week or two from now, and to something more date-like, but casual... like ice skating, bowling, a carnival if there's any around. The movies could be too much for a first date. If she refuses you again... give it up.|`|lJjrfgJdaa	Well maybe she's more of an adventurous kind of girl and you should've said something more like bowling, or ice skating instead of bible study. Which is good and all but most girls would rather do something different, unless they actually go to your church.|`|okolAkV8aa	i agree wit beth b by a hundred n 10 percent <br>  bcuz if a guy asked me 2 come 2 bible study i would prob say u gotaa be kidding n laugh then feel guilty 4 makein him sad <br>  after that depends on the guy lol he might change he might not         <br>  most girls wanna party not pray most of us wanna watch movies not be bored listening 2 some preacher dude or dudet so yea    try movies but let her choose the movie<br>  <br>  k tel me how it goes <br>  <br>  <3 me|`|KtXmsfQlaa	Getting hurt is a part of life. Taking chances is also a part of life. Roll with what you feel for this girl and if she doesnt feel it then at least you tried. You will never get a chance if you dont take one.|`|6UTuaJaJaa	hahaha "yeah, maybe" that's what I said to my gf before i went out with her. but yeah maybe is like yeah but i'm going to try but even if i can't, please don't say anything. lol|`|A6mczoMbaa	if shes not religious thats probably why.|`|u1CdDWz0aa	Being a chick and all, whenever i say 'yhea maybe' to a date, it's because i'm really not interested.<br>  <br>  but thats just me|`|p7vxsanRaa	im sorry to say she isnt interested|`|GO3UeFsOaa	wait what does religon have 2 do with this?|`|koXcq0l1aa	maybe she didn't want to do a church session.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	That means she doesnt really know if she wants to go out with you as you haven't done anything that made her go oh he's quite lovely. Ya dig?|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	"yeah, maybe" means just that, maybe. i wouldn't put much stock in her actually going out with you, but if you're persistent (in a non annoying sort of way) then she may just change her mind.|`|zka26204aa	it means that she is not really interested in dating you.  If she had been, she would have rearranged her schedule or suggested a date when she was not busy.|`|AA11090428	Is this a crush or is this girl you like for a long time? If it is a crush, take it slowly. If you have already like this girl for sometime, you should know by now the answer.<br>  <br>  First of all, one of the main mistakes a guy makes is that he assumes whether a girl likes him or not by his advances. You should not be bothered by whether or not this girl accepts your invitations.<br>  <br>  You are also starting off at the wrong foot. Asking someone out first without knowing the person more is not really a wise move. You should try to initiate some light conversations to get her to know you better. However, I know most guys get stuck at this stage. Once the both of you are more comfortable with each other, then you should start asking out out.<br>  <br>  A stable relationship always starts off with the right foundations. Asking a girl out without knowing her first is just flirting around. Most girls do not like that.<br>  <br>  Hopes this helps.|`|Lq4306a5aa	I'd back off and see how that turned out.  If you seem like you are desperate (as though she is the only girl you could get), she might think there is something wrong with you.  If you back off, like you know you're a hot commodity and there are other girls that like you, then she may see you as a hot commodity and gain interest.  <br>  <br>  Most girls that like guys or guys that like girls jump at the opportunity to date someone if asked out (if there's attraction).  Think about it, if she asked you out, would you say you were busy, given that you really like her?  Doubt it.  I don't think you are that busy.  You can find time for her.  If she liked you that much, she'd find time instead of risking sending the signal that she's not that into you.  Instead, she just sounded indifferent, as though she was too nice to reject you.<br>  <br>  But it's okay if she don't like you.  There are tons of hot chix out there and you're single.  You should have pockets bursting full of phone numbers to empty every night at the end of the day.  YOU SHOULD BE BUSY TOO! Why do you pin all of your hopes on one girl???  <br>  <br>  You don't even know her that that well.  You should be approaching and flirting with lots of girls b/c you're young and you can.  <br>  <br>  I used to be you and did the same stuff.  I'd like a girl for like 6 months or a year and then pop the question nervously just to get an answer that was not a rejection, but no gf.  Eventually, I woke and got more outgoing and confident.  I practiced flirting with lots of chix until it became fun and saw results relatively soon.  Wish I'd learned earlier, but that's life.
wI3AAkIoaa	Yes if I thought it was a good question.  And sometimes it is fun to see the answer they chose.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	I do all the time|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	yeah, sometimes i do that too.|`|2LDtSDMuaa	lol i do.<br>  :]]|`|p7vxsanRaa	i click the watchlist button if i care enough about the question and then later look but i only do that if the question applys to me|`|X2z7mbfaaa	absolutely|`|q1LhYjv1aa	I do too.  Because I want to see the best advise someone gives.  That is if my answer wasn't pick.|`|Gs2VCx6daa	Yep.<br>  And I rant when my answer pwns but I lose. :c|`|OPlRYn10aa	i do|`|U0RtiXleaa	i agree with leslie k|`|0lQtTE9Daa	if you got best answer it sends you an email.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	yes i do i admit it and sometimes im like wtf my answer was better!!!  (stomping feet)  hehehhe
QtaPF83iaa	You have good morals I admire that.  Maybe with how most ppl in todays society think he just didn't think youd react like you did.  I know a number of ppl who would think it was no big deal. he probably hoped you were blinded by love.|`|xdOgQPEkaa	some men think they are really good at playing game and dont know what to do when they find out they arent<br>  sounds like he has an ego <br>  <br>  good for you|`|3eea4704cf8414e46d6ef6d3729ba82baa	You must be really upset about this or it wouldn't be keeping you up in the middle of the night.  I'm thirty-nine, never had a relationship.   But most people aren't as scared of relationships as I am.  I'm too smart for my own good.|`|m0WUEtqXaa	Im with you on this...he should have been upfront at least........... how are you meant to believe him if he can keep this kind of stuff?|`|kHRD7uUAaa	hey it works on most women so we just take our chances you win some and you lose some.|`|EsRuOno1aa	I don't think its neccessarily a bad thing that hes dating you even if he is married, if he is in fact separted, but why lie about it? Why not just be honest. What else has he lied about? Ya know what I mean. If someone is not honest with you from the beginning, then you lose all trust in them. I learned something the one time I went to church and it was that when you lie to someone the consequences are worst then when you tell the truth. Because once you lie to someone, the trust is pretty much out the window. To me trust is one of the most things in a relationship. And the fact that you guys haven't hadn't sex in 7 months might indicate that he's not being honest about whether or not his penis has stayed in his pants the whole time you've been together. Just my thoughts.|`|8fXoctcjaa	5 years ago they seperated, she moved out of state and is living with another man.<br>  <br>  Even though I agree he lied, it's not worth getting that upset over.<br>  <br>  7 months and no sex?  If he stayed with you that long and never got any sex, he must have loved you more than any man has ever loved any woman.<br>  <br>  You lost out big time.<br>  <br>  Try Zoloft, about 100mg per day to start.|`|lxF2hvisaa	some people can't afford to get divorced, so they leave it a "legal seperation" until they are ready to be married again. He probably didnt tell you at first b/c he wanted to wait until he knew how serious he was going to be with you-didnt want to scare you off on the first date.|`|rsHbMpjXaa	I can certainly understand you feeling angry if you blatantly asked him "are you single or married?" and he lied. He had an opportunity to tell you, and he didn't take it. That must really hurt, and no wonder you feel lied to and betrayed by that.<br>  However, I do think your anger is clouding your judgement a bit right now. Although they were still legally married, the fact is, he evidently didn't consider himself to be married any longer, for it truly was in name only - they were living apart, even in different states, and his wife had moved on with her life and taken up with another man. It is not entirely fair for you to be so harsh to your man though ... in fact it is grossly unfair for you to say to him "so she's out whoring herself like you are huh buddy?" ... I know you were angry, but that was uncalled for. He has not been out "whoring" at all; on the contrary it seems he has maintained ONE relationship, with you, and he has not forced the issue of sex, although he is clearly attracted to you and would no doubt like to have been physically intimate with you. <br>  I really do understand that you must have been unimaginably angry to discover that he was still technically married - but it is a technicality - they are not living as a married couple and haven't done for years. Yes, they should file for divorce and get the paperwork finalised. But please don't throw away a good relationship over this. Be angry, vent, tell him he was wrong not to tell you up front, insist that he gets on with filing for divorce if they truly are not going to reconcile (and they've had 5 years apart, so it's evident that they're not!!). But don't overdramatise this and be all affronted that a "married man" had you as a mistress on the side. That is not what happened. If you can't forgive the initial deceit, fair enough, but for your own sake as well as his, be very clear that it is the lie that was the problem ... I don't think he's done anything else wrong actually.
PevKGmeFaa	no. lets be friends is just a nice thing to say to a girl. so that she doesnt cry. but if u do want to be friends w/ this guys so bad...<br>  <br>  my best bet is to go different ways for now. let it all cool off. then later when you see him (he may have a girl) you'll be friends.
BbRewQjQaa	Sometimes you just have to roll with it. And this is a case of that take the relationship for what it is. Don't get to involved till the moments right.|`|bbMi6Fknaa	thats pathetic. <br>  the whole scenario.<br>  <br>  dazed and confused
AA10518973	Well if your okay at the way he treated your mother then go ahead. Just remember that ur mom kept him away for a reason. Just also inform her before  you do anything. Her feelings matter and you always have to be honest with her. Best wishes|`|AA11832714	Oh Man What are You Confused about?<br>   This Guy was calling Your Mum and Aunt Trash, So < What was He doing There? Did He want to stay there because He felt some responsibility, or did He stay for convenience.?

PevKGmeFaa	first of all, let me say im sorry for your loss. and just because you act like your father, doesnt mean youll follow his path<br>  <br>  my initial advice is to try God. if youre not religious or dont believe i dont mean to offend you. but try God.

I lost my son 4 years ago.  It was unexpected as was your fathers.  I am so sorry for your loss and I totally understand your pain. I have two kids who live with me and both are over 21.  My daughter is afraid that what happened to her brother will happen to her.  She even had medical tests done, they both did, after they lost their brother to make sure they don't have the same problem he had.  We live this every moment of our day.  It is like a bad movie running over and over again. If you cannot get to psychiatrist, how about starting with your doctor? You are old enough now anyway to get a real 'adult' doctor and you could start that way.  Then he/she will guide you to counseling.  I don't know where you live but when we lost our father in law 3 years ago we got a call from Hospice who offered free counseling for a year. They said that after that they would see us on a sliding scale. Do you have a school counselor or nurse you could talk to and maybe get ideas for your area?  Those are a few ideas that come to mind.  We all took advantage of some free counseling. Oh, even the cemetery has meetings for free on Sundays.  Also hospitals have grief counseling.  I hope some of this helps and I do understand because I live it everyday. God bless and I am praying for you.|`|f48277b0eedf18349f408b252bd473a1aa	firstly, i am so sorry for your loss, and i mean it for you and everyone who loses a loved one.  Sorry doesn't even feel like enough to say, i won't say i understand or anything like that, becuz i don't<br>  <br>  Suicidal thoughts are actually fairly normal, if you actually have a plan, on how, where, and when your going to kill yourself, that's when you should consider a counselor or something.  And yes, if you feel calmer and more relaxed when you tell yourself "i'll do it in the morning if i still feel this bad"  then it's fine.<br>  <br>  I can relate to depression, have gone through it,  have also lost a loved one.  But you should go to a counselor, it helps so much more than you will believe at this point, someone who will actually listen to you, not judge you or your family, just getting the burden off your shoulders is a big relief<br>  <br>  Remember this is YOUR life you are living, not your dads, YOU have complete control over what YOU do.  Right now the most important person in the world, is you, take care of number 1 right now, don't make other people's problems yours too, you have enough to deal with.<br>  <br>  Basically what i'm saying, do what you have to, to get through this.

ApYzZhXNaa	It doesn't sound like you've had much of a conversation about his children, and your relationship. <br>  If he is not welcoming you into his family right away, that's good.<br>  I'm not saying your not a great women, but he should want the absolute best for his kids... and they need to like you too.<br>  Slow down and just try dating him for a while. Get some of that extra attention you need from your other friends and family.<br>  His affections are directly connected to his children and his kids may not be that into you at the moment. He might be taking into account the feeling of his children's natural mom whom might be effected by the emotions of her boys as well.<br>  If you can be patient, everyone will adjust and the outcome will be great:) Its not only about you, and its not only about him. Its all y'all.|`|FnGebaOLaa	if he really likes you, it shouldn't be a problem!<br>  I would def. suggest you get to know him more, and remember you will NEVER becenter of attention until they are older, once the younger one is in h.s and the other one is in college, the army, or whatever!<br>  If you are looking for a guy to give you 24/7 attention then you should think twice about asingle working guy, with children who are not yet in h.s!<br>  If on the other hand, you are O.K with not being 1st 2nd or 3rd on his list, than go with it!  He will eventually get you to join in the fun, going to baseball games etc. this is how you will connect with the kids. And this is where you will spend most of your time with him.<br>  I hope not to come off as mean, just keeping it realistic!|`|qLhPXRpUaa	be ready for feed back from the kids it will be good and sometimes bad. i hear it all the time from the kid them self. shes cool, i love her, shes my best friend, shes mean, your not my mother, you cant tell me what to do. just let dad do his thing and you stay out of it, you should be fine.

But also if i was u i might have just acted like i didnt touch her, cause then it would look like it was an accident.

But you can have a one to one talk with him and find out|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hey there, it sounds like he does like you, but he is fighting his feelings because he is with someone, i am a married female (straight) and before i was married i have had it happen to me that guys would act like they liked me and then get cold and run off and i heard it thru the grapevine that they liked me but knew i was taken.......<br>  <br>  i dont know what to tell you to do i would say ask him to go to lunch or something, but he might say no cause he is with someone and then you will feel rejected......<br>  <br>  do you want to take a chance and ask him to lunch or out for a drink?  do you feel you are strong enough if he says no sorry cause he is with someone, or would you rather leave things the way they are?   im sorry i can't be more help, i wish i could help more........ :(<br>  <br>  if it were me, i would have to know if he liked me or not......but keep in mind he is with someone, what if he goes out to lunch with you or things happen between you two, and he still stays with his bf ?? <br>  <br>  you have to think all of this out in your head......<br>  <br>  i say go for it, you only live once.......at least you can say you tried.....<br>  <br>  i hope it works out for you, please feel free to email me at summerwind07044@aol.com to let me know what you decide!!!  <br>  <br>  best wishes!!|`|F5eKBBaXaa	He's with me right now sorry he's taken.|`|D6FBLQfwaa	My friend...I know how you feel. Love hurts like hell sometimes! With that said, I remind you that it "takes two to tango". You absolutely MUST directly tell him how you feel! Trust me on this one, experience shows me that the direct approach yields the most decisive results. If he feels the same way, he needs to drop the drama-queen boyfriend, and hitch a ride on the love boat (pardon the corny metaphor). However, if it turns out he doesn't feel the same, then frankly he's a user for leading you on, and not worth your time. Likewise, if he has feelings for you, but doesn't drop the whiner and tango, he isn't worth your time. Good luck!|`|KRqse9eeaa	you'll never know how he feels about you if you don't approach him and tell him how you feel. If you love him you should take that chance. Yes, there is a chance that he'll say you two are just friends, but then again you may get the answer you want to hear. I don't really know how to interpret his behavior or I would shed some light on it dear. (Now I am just guessing here) but it sounds to me that through it all there is an attraction of some sort.|`|OkZBNhhgaa	Love is a tricky thing no matter what your orientation so I do feel sorry for you.  It sounds to me that this guy might have feelings for you but because he is already with someone he is finding it difficult to tell you how he feels.  If, as you say, his partner is very emotional he might not want to end things in case this sets him off so he is putting up with things as they are.<br>  <br>  The hardest thing about this situation is that the two of you work together.  You can't afford to let your feelings get in the way of your job, not if you want to keep it.  I know it must be hard for you to see this guy every day and not be able to open up to him but if this is the way he wants it then you have to bear with him.  Just be a friend and listen to him if he wants to talk but try not to give any conflicting advice if he bemoans his situation.  If he isn't happy then only he can change that.  I wish you all the luck in the world and hope that you and your dream guy will be together one day.  Take care xx.|`|r5VFLa84aa	WOW! What a long lovely story that I didn't even bother reading
sIr2fWh6aa	Just be the bigger person.  You're there for your mutual friend, notfor you former friend.  If he tries to talk to you, be congenial and talk back to him, but not overly friendly.. but don't give him the cold-shoulder either, because that would make you look bad infront of everyone else.

IE I'll love you for this I will not love you for that. That is living in purgatory. You have every right to be with someone who will love you for you. To love you unconditionally on your good days and bad days too. That's real love. Also for you to feel guilty for walking away why would you do that to yourself? Honestly rejoice in the contrast he has shown you. Because now you know what you don't want. Which gives you better clarity to know what you do want in a partner.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Well, aren't we falling into someones trap???<br>  <br>  This is exactly what he wants you to do is feel bad.<br>  <br>  That's why he pulled all this I'm depressed crap out on you.  <br>  <br>  He is manipulating you.

You were right to dump him. What a freak. You shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to be treated like a human being and not some slave that has to do EVERYTHING he says or else. My fiance would NEVER do that to me. He tells me he loves me the way I am every day. A boyfriend should treat you like you are the most beautiful woman in the world, which is something he didn't do. Maybe he will treat his next girlfriend better.|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	First he was controlling and now when that didn’t work, he’s trying to lay a guilt trip on you.  I know what I’d do--walk away and not look back, because I don’t want to be with someone like that (not even as friends).|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	If you want to be friends, that would be fine.  But he has some serious problems on board to get so nuts about your "trim."  He sounds like he has a hell of a lot more going on than depression.  He sounds like he may be OCD.  Just a guess.  And I will warn you here.  Most men tend not to stick with their treatment for emotional problems.  I'm not sure why that's true, but it is.<br>  <br>  And why would you feel any guilt over this?  You didn't make him that way.  You have the right to walk away if you so choose.  He said some really humiliating stuff to you.  I doubt I would go back, but that's me, not you.  What you choose to do is totally up to you.  But please don't let him manipulate you.  Follow your gut.|`|B359bLqsaa	If you love him and want to give him another chance, then he should really show that he is willing to change, and you should wait to see change.  If he is truly controlling, then he is not going to just change overnight, no matter how much he wants to.  It will only be a matter of time before his controlling behaviors show up again and will make you miserable all over again.  <br>  <br>  I know because I married a controlling obsessive man, and then my real troubles started.  He argues with me because of totally stupid things like the way towels are folded, how dishes are put in the dishwasher, closing the shower curtain, storing the vacuum cleaner.... blah blah blah....|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	sorry but he's a bit ridiculous. having a huge-hissy fit for something as trivial as THAT? don't feel guilty for ridding yourself of ALOT of futur stress. its not only rude but selfish of him to expect you to be completely shaved on a daily basis. you ARE an adult female and it is natural to have hair and grow-in when you DO shave. please realize that this man will stress you, no-doubt!<br>  <br>  ultimately its your choice, in my opinion, go before it gets too deep...

Ff7mCzlPaa	Why on earth would you even be thinking about this when your boyfriend was ABUSIVE?  He hit you... that's domestic violence... and it's a crime.... i'd like to know what you're thinking and why you believe his mother should tolerate any of this stuff in her home?<br>  <br>  Granted you were the one who had the torn clothes, injuries, but you were the obvious person to toss out, since you're not a family member.<br>  <br>  People with bipolar disorder aren't "devils" -- bipolar is manageable and if your boyfriend isn't following a mental health professional's care plan, then it's his mother's fault (his too).<br>  <br>  let this go and i hope you aren't seeing him anymore.|`|OjStHptwaa	haha a mamas boy? what where you doing with him the first place? you don't need a mamas boy, what you need is a true independent man who is normal and who is going to like you the way you are|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	I was going to answer this but kp got it right.

If you’re old enough to get married, you need to be responsible enough to establish your own household and not have to move in with 'mommy' (or mommy-in-law).<br>  <br>  Second, if you’re physically fighting with him (especially to the point of drawing blood and leaving bruises), then the two of you do NOT need to be in the same household.<br>  <br>  Third, of course, when it comes down to ‘who leaves', you’re the one who’s going to be leaving.  That’s her son. Did you really expect her to choose you over him?<br>  <br>  Go back home to your own family. Get some professional help to deal with the depression, the suicide attempt, and to try to learn how real relationships are suppose to work.  And stay out of relationships until you’re gotten yourself straightened out and you’re mature enough to handle one.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDITED TO ADD THIS AFTER YOU ADDED ADDITIONAL DETAILS:<br>  <br>  Well, are you married or not?  Because if you’re not married stop calling her your ‘mother-in-law’.  In that case she’s merely your boyfriend’s mother.  That’s a much different thing.  However, that doesn’t change the answer—yes, she had every right to throw you out of the house (regardless of who was at fault for the fight) and tell you not to come back.  And if you had a lick of sense, she wouldn’t have had to told you that.  You would have left and not come back on your own.  Again—get some counseling and stay away from this boy who seems to feel that beating someone is acceptable behavior.
UNyG5Iw2aa	Its difficult to put yourself out there and not know what you will get in return. Is what you said weird? No, absolutely not. You simply stated that you thought her nice enough to talk to and would she like to start talking to you. You sent out an invitation. Unfortunately, this girl doesn't understand how to respond to you. I'll bet that she doesn't know what she wants from you and therefore she simply says nothing. I am gathering that you are in high school. School age girls, when they have absolutely no interest, will often tease you for your effort. I know that sounds awful, but it is more to do with their own embarrassment than you. Because this one remains silent, I believe she has not made a decision. Wait one week, then approach her again. If she blows you off a second time, then move on, she's not digging you and someone else will. Trust me on that one. And if she starts interacting with you again. Congratulations!|`|XpDt1bqHaa	So if you put this message on Myspace where other people can see it she's trying to shut you down because she doesn't want people to associate you with her....sorry...her loss.|`|Q2dJhKJraa	I dont think it weird at all, but maybe she is afraid your stalking her!|`|SbsB0bwEaa	what you said was normal dont worry about it kid. if she didnt reply then she has problems.|`|chZFmJOPaa	That is weird!

He already told you the relationship was too much pressure for him.  <br>  <br>  You texted him saying you wanted him back then you said you were moving on.  You are playing games and he is probably tired of it.<br>  <br>  He does not want to see you, at least now.  If he wants to get in touch with you again he will, but for now you need to leave it alone period
AgBH66nJaa	It sounds like that's all you can tell him really, but men do take longer to heal that girls do and at first they can seem unforgiving but when they've had time to think about it 9 times out of 10 they feel a bit better, if he doesn't respond this time then don't make the mistake I did of chasing him and begging him for forgiveness because then you just look like a fool and a little bit desperate, not only does that put him off but it makes him feel a bit superior and makes him think you're clearly desperate and he's too good for you. I'm not saying all men are like this but this is my experience. <br>  Your fight doesn't seem to serious although it might feel like it now, go over there and apologise, tell him how you really feel and if he doesn't respond straight away then don't chaise him around, leave it for a while before texting him how is he, the longer you're not around, the more time he has to miss you it's like they say - absence makes the heart grow fonder. Hope this helps x|`|6UTuaJaJaa	you just need to say whatever you need to say|`|35FwA4kIaa	Promise you'll stop acting like you're 12?<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|zY3ixLW6aa	be mature|`|V1ipsxA3aa	Don't say it, be it.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	I have to say you do sound very high maintenance which would put huge pressure on him.<br>  <br>  You sulking, flirting and being nasty does not sound like good assets to have for your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I say move on and leave this poor chap alone.|`|60YOy0rHaa	I think maybe you should take a break from guys. It'll really help you sort out your problems and give you a clear mind to think. Plus, a few weeks by yourself certainly can't hurt you. I promise, you'll end up better from the experience.
anfhcnWeaa	is this a joke because it kinda sounds like you saw the movie <br>  Different For Girls<br>   and thought it would be fun to see what kind of responses you could get from people online,<br>  <br>   but if you are being truthful and it really is happening to you then i would recommend seeing the movie it might help you cope with the problem.  <br>   and give you a true understanding of the way love works.|`|ucVBQrbvaa	How sad is it that English isn't even my 5th language,I come from another galaxy and I can smell this fake a mile away?

08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	From life experiences dealing with different people, I have turned myself into a "don't believe it until you see it" kind of person. People can say all they want, but I will not believe it until I see that they are actually going thru it. U might as well give that up. People are fake like that and she isn't the only one that is going to screw you over in life. U should've been looking for other photographers besides her that could have done the job. Don't just rely on one person to help you out with something. u should always have your options open for reasons such as the one you described right now. did you pay this girl to do your pictures? if so I have another saying that I go by. "sometimes there is a time to be cool, but other times you have to act a fool to get results." if that girl has your pictures you need to be on her like white on rice until she gets them to you. sometimes you have to bother people girl until they give you what's rightfully supposed to be yours. It sounds like she is not a professional. If u don't want to show boldness, then I suggest going to a better photographer who is willing to work with you and get the job done right. Ask questions b4 they take the pictures so you can be sure you are going to get what you need and want. and make them put it in writing|`|vjB9ARWmaa	forget the *****|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Tell her to not offer services that she cannot follow through with. Its poor etiquette and if she hadn't done this , you might have been able to get someone else to do it. Tell her that her efforts are "not" appreciated and that from now on you will be taking important jobs to professionals. This won't solve your problem, but at least she will know that you are offended by her lack of effort. Maybe it will make you feel better to know that she knows how you feel.|`|tT06e5zPaa	I would be incredibly annoyed; what she is doing isn't very good etiquette at all. Sorry to tell you though, but from an outsiders perspective, it doesn't really look like she'll ever follow through, so yeah, you should just move on and no better about her in the future. <br>  <br>  Cheers :)|`|AA11623179	tell her liers go to hell.|`|Xu16kLLpaa	ohhhhh wata snitch..... forget her....<br>  learn from ur lesson and dont choose people who u really dont know,|`|NCiT0Zd5aa	You get what you pay for.<br>  You paid nothing, you got nothing.<br>  Time to pay a real photographer to do your pictures!

If she did she wouldn't of been "looking for a way to get away from me". I think she was just being polite the first time.<br>  <br>  Peace bro. Goodluck|`|puJb7U6Maa	From my perspective as a woman, I don't think so. I'm sorry. It's just a normal reaction woman make when they aren't interested.|`|o9VVtLHoaa	I think it's better to find another woman, who really wants you.|`|yQFHoEqxaa	I'm sorry but she was just being polite the first time. :(|`|yjtvfTBSaa	she was just being nice kiddo|`|5tnTLAstaa	No, she don't like you. The first time you guys talk, she carried on with the conversation just to be polite. But then, always remember this, when a woman seems distant on your second meeting, beware! She's not that into you. Better find someone who will not ignore you and would love to have conversations with you. :)
xxcTgNquaa	it's tottally natural to like girls and guys. i mean c'mon now people. anyways, i'm not bi or anything so i might not have to best answer. but if a guy really cares for you he won't give a flying **** if you like girls too. i mean a nice guy, as rare as they come, will except you for you. and all the losers who think otherwise can stick it in a juice box and suck it! i hate it when people are prejudice against gays. i feel so strongly about gay love. i mean it's weird cus i'm straight, but i love and except all people, except haters. it's immensly natural to watch videos too. i mean there's a time in everyones life where they watch/look at porno or some version of sexual action. your just becoming aware of your surroundings. no worries what so ever. i have a bi friend who went through this a year ago. she liked/s me and we are super close! she is WAY into guy and **** too so yeah. . .<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you.<br>  <br>  good luck:]|`|a2t1hnl6aa	There's no such thing as being bi, you're either straight or gay. So, STOP, just because you think you can get more attention for liking girls from guys, like you mentioned above.... you're not the first one who thought that up...you're just an attention w****... get over yourself. You're math is incorrect.|`|gx2ksWHaaa	ha that is crazy u don't have to worry about its just may b u r passing ur tym vth her dats y dont wory just ignore her n go with ur bfri n let him touch n u 2 b free vth vith him 1 thing don't even talk to him about dat just let him kiss u or u go 4 it n c u vill feel him|`|vzlpD68aaa	Lolz. your langoo is a funny. is like insane lol|`|9BY5kPukaa	You really should seek therapy.  I think your brain is slightly off by a few degrees of dead center, this will affect your thinking, which it has.  You might be prescribed Librium to get you on track, you will be okay if it works.  If not, a few electric shock treatments should do the trick. Good luck!|`|HkgTtCMyaa	there is no such thing as bi everyone i know that said they were bi turned out to go for the same SEX in the endd
1RqPa4RJaa	i'd say take start taking your money out slowly and look to see if there is a reaction. if not, then keep taking it out and offer it to him. if there is, go with the flow. most guys say they believe in gender equality, but really most of those most don't mean it.|`|ENVkTHEsaa	I think that he will prob pay the first time but you should offer and the second time you go out making pick up the drink tab or dinner tab maybe both  - if you like him its only fair everything should be  50/50. I would never want to date a woman who treated me like an ATM but some guys have to do that i guess to get a women they are happy with.|`|8lboONb2aa	I always go into a date expecting to pay for everything and I don't mind at all. I think it's classy for the lady to at least offer to help out though and not just ride on my credit at which point I'll let her pay for something small like a tip or candy...|`|a2t1hnl6aa	I say, guy pays for the thing that will cost more and you pay for the cheap thing. But, when you start dating, it's all him.|`|gx2ksWHaaa	if he is asking u for the date he should pay if u don't want him to pay u just go n buy ur tickets if he is talking about equality then may b he is poor or he want just a fri with whom he can pass his tym|`|ylcYx79Baa	to be honest, the very first date i ever went on the girl ended up paying lol.|`|25l10HL8aa	um, I would bring out he money and if he says don't worry I will pay than its your lucky day.|`|uPL3e3tyaa	Take money along to cover anything you eat and a 50-mile radius escape taxi in an emergency. Offer to pay when you like, but don't expect him to carry you...guys like to impress, but we don't like to be made to feel we're a "cash cow".|`|estIQEVNaa	Most guys pay or at least I think so, but if he talks bad about gender equality why are you dating him anyway?|`|qzRDh8Rgaa	Wait, I always pay, always, unless it's a totally friend relationship. But god I would never let a girl pay.<br>  <br>  But!<br>  You are saying $40, and I usually pay 6-12 bucks for a girl when we hang out...<br>  <br>  $40 bucks is a lot of money... for the movie you pay.. for the dinner he should pay... So if you guys are watching a movie... make sure you give him your $8.... and dinner expect his @ss to pay...<br>  <br>  He better... freakin slap him if he signals for cash..|`|UOmH9vaPaa	I always pay on the first date but it is nice to get an offer to pay her part even though I'll turn it down. I always like it when a woman tells me they'll buy next time. I don't count on it but it gives me an idea of how she is and how she thinks.|`|02sblnZGaa	Not to be disapointed , make sure you have your money ready, I will doubt anyone is wiling to pay in this economy.|`|hJZWMkFZaa	well if he is really that into you, he wont let you pay, but hand him the 4o dollars and when he says he will pay, you smile and say next time its on me :)
25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	It is hard thing to do, I know and I used to be depressed about it when I was alone and the worst thing to do is to be with someone just to be with someone. I would find little things to cheer me up. I would go buy myself something small, or exercise or go on a walk or go into a store I have never been in that I keep saying that I have been meaning to go into. I also have a collection of movies that will always cheer me up on hand and whenever I am down or upset I watch them to cheer myself up. A lot of times when you are just out looking around you meet the coolest people like Hot Topic, the most interesting people are in there and I will sometimes strike up random conversations with people that seem interesting. I read your other post and I know what you are going through, it is painful to be alone and it feels like your heart is being torn out of your chest because you have no one to talk to and you are wanting to be in a relationship. When I was 16 I met the man I later married and am now divorcing after saving up the money he was not a good person so I really wish that I had been alone and maybe I would have finished school and gone to college and my life would have been better for it. Is there anyone that you find interesting at work/school/church? Another thing, I am not sure if you do this but I did, was when people got too close to me I would say something or do something to push them away because I was scared they would hurt me if they knew the real me which I finally stopped doing and I have more friends and I met a very nice man that loves me very much. Also, are you very shy? This can be hindering the ability for you to meet people. I once knew a guy that was so shy that he couldn't talk to people other than his very very closest friends and we had to coach him on talking to girls. Where do you live? If you are in my state we can hang out together sometime and I will send you an email, (if you want me to) and if not I can hit you up on IM.<br>  <br>  "Shannon...I struggle with social anxiety, I used to get panic attacks, I've gotten better at managing it but its still a struggle. When I go somewhere it feels like everyone is judging me and yes as a result of social anxiety, I'm scared to make friends, I don't have many friends, hence the loneliness. :-/"<br>  <br>  I understand, I was just like you not too long ago and it almost cost me my best friend and the man I want to marry. I used to get panic attacks even when I was going to go somewhere with him (like a party with a lot of people I knew or even over to his parents when it was more then just them) and he was upset because he was so proud to be with me and he wanted to show off his new girlfriend etc, and it took him a long time to understand how I was. Have you told your doctor that you are getting anxious/depressed in social situations? I used to have really bad anger issues also until I was put on antidepressants/anti-anxiety medications. They really do help and it was hard for me to tell him this but it was so worth it, I am confident, I can talk to people and I am not scared of social situations anymore. I used to go out and think the same thing, that they were all looking at me and laughing at me and not at something else. I am so sorry that you are going through this but if you get the medications I promise it will get better and give them a little bit of time to start working.<br>  Hang in there (((((hugs))))<br>  <br>  :( We live in different states I am in VA and you are very welcome :)|`|vyL7yEleaa	for me... i delve into a hobby that i like. <br>  <br>  i am a budding artist with the use of photoshop and corel painter so when i am lonley i dive head first into fine tuning my skills in those programs. sometimes i will stay over at one of my friends house. <br>  <br>  i know not long after my wedding my fiance is going to be leaving for basic training so i will be alone (again) for several months. since i live at home still i will be moving in with my friend so it will help keep my mind off the fact my husband is training for war.

ixmaM395aa	No way are you over thinking your future... clearly the thoughts of a mature minded woman! <br>  <br>  Here's my suggestion, why don't you go with him but keep the house! Instead of partially renting the house out put it on the rental market as a "family home" to rent. That way you should be able to make as much - maybe less maybe more - from the rental profit to continue paying off the mortgage. <br>  <br>  Then you can go with your husband for say 6-12months and rent just a small place there, or buy another house for investment later on. <br>  <br>  That personally is what I would do. Maybe it would be nice for the change for both yourself and your husband. Leaving your family is hard but they're just a drive away (or more, sorry don't know the States distance all that well). And they can come and visit you. I'm sure if you're missing them that much one of them will let you stay with them for the week just so you can spend some quality time with them. <br>  <br>  Give that a thought. Because whatever great opportunity gets thrown ones way of late should be taken and run with! <br>  <br>  I hope you find a comfortable arrangement :)
ym8jbkogaa	Just repeat back your apology, straight and plain (and you have to mean it too! She'll know if it's phony or not).<br>  <br>  Then, give her some alone time. If you keep begging her to forgive you, you're just gonna look like a pushover and in fact, that will make her treat you even worse later on in the course of your friendship. If she really does like you as a friend, she'll forgive in due time. If she doesn't, then...I guess she is just a very narrow-minded person, and probably would be one of those friends who'll fade away later on.|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	well, i faced this kind of situation before when i was 17 (now 20).<br>  <br>  BUT try not to make yourself very LOW! dont say something like "i hate when people dont like me". if these words keep coming out from your mouth, then people will take advantage on u!<br>  <br>  ps, u had deleted the pictures and apologized. u had done more than enough. if she still cant forgive u, then NEVERMIND! say to yourself, "it wont hurt me a bit for losing such a friend!"|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	Just don't bother her for like a day...try to act like you're a stranger.

0cf22b7960cebade8dc4a6b3b4414835aa	If you take any advice from her, please take this.  Find yourself a mental health professional to talk to.  You may need medication, or simply psyciatric help.  This is nothing to be ashamed of.  Hopefully for you these feelings are a chemical imbalance in the brain which can over time be brought under control by the right medications.  You will probably also need some counseling.  Please don't let this get out of control, you can have a happier life.  If you need help finding a professional to talk to there are normally student services at colleges for those things as well as county clinics in some areas.  Normally they will all work with you and your income.  It may even be free.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Well men has this period in their life when they feel they r getting old so fast, and as a reaction they try to do kids and teenage stuff, this period is very important u should understand how he is feeling, therapy is very important if he goes with u, talking to him in a slow motion might help as well, tell him, he is not gonna be young for ever, and he should base something now while he can for future and for his family, talk to him from yr heart and not to change things, let him know that.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|wi6mkT30aa	Hey hon, I know this is a tough one to deal with. Epically with two small kids around. Not only is this annoying to you but you don't want your children to grow up looking at their father like this is all his life is and that's what they turn out to be as well. I see your strong point of view here and I think that him coming into the therapy sessions would be a huge help.<br>  <br>  Yet, maybe before doing that you should sit down and have a serious heart to heart talk with him. My advice for you is to have alone talk time, a NICE talk. No snappiness, rude, blah, ugh, or upset attitude just  your normal talking voice. Tell him lately you've been feeling over worked with everything and you'd just like a little help. Ask him nicely so he feels more needed rather than Pushed. Then let him know how that's been making you feel, don't be afraid to express Your feelings and show him that his behavior laziness has been making you feel more tired and stressed. Let him talk as well and listen to his words, maybe you two can compromise a little and work around this. Depending on your children's ages whenever they start doing little chores make a chart for the whole family to make it more fun and not so piled up on ONE person (Who is mainly you right now) not only will this give you a break but he can help out with what is needed! <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope the best for you hon, good luck with everything!|`|XqUvTCqJaa	Yes I agree with a therapist, also talk to him and be straight with him. Tell him how you feel, and what his lifestyle is doing to yall.

6DmsiLGbaa	I'm not married, but I have two friends with some truly disgusting in-laws.  One of them has a mother-in-law who kept all of her children's umbilical cords, lost teeth or cut hair in jars that she's supposed to bury in the garden.  Problem is, she's too lazy to dig the hole, so they're just sitting outside.  You can probably imagine how disgusting that is.<br>  <br>  And then there's another friend whose father-in-law loves to cook fish and things.

That was a very stressful time for you, and I certainly hope you get a healthy diagnosis.<br>  <br>  I would call up each family member, tell them how worried you are, and ask them why they would not comfort you.<br>  <br>  Then you will know for sure what their true feelings are.  Give them the benefit of the doubt, until you hear what they have to say.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zUdxoRbyaa	that's horrible. hope you are okay. im gonna give you a prayer and a star.|`|HcobJXhBaa	they probably didnt think you wanted anyone to go with you. like you just wanted to try and do it on your own. let them know you need support and im sure you will get it|`|7ZyYXu9Saa	Tell your familly how you feel, they probabily didnt know that you were offended by this so if you explain to them everything they will probably be more willing to get involved in the future<br>  <br>  Good Luck :P
XhtDtZK9aa	You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders.If you were my child I would be proud of you. I think the way your supporting your Grandfather is commendable. Tell you mom how much you love her and explain your feelings to her again. If she doesn't  come around at least you've done your part. And  the fact your doing well in school is <br>   wonderful,education is so important.Your Grandfather loved your Grandma and that is why he wants love again. Keep your head up.|`|mSjXW7Puaa	First of all do not conclude anything as whenever there is change in life we do react differently to it. I feel we all have right to live happily , and take our decision .As your grandfather is in relationship after you grandmother died , it may be because he was lonely and needed a companion. Your mom's and uncle's reaction is also as expected , they do not want to accept anyone in place of their mother, they must be thinking that what all your grandmom did for grandpa , he forgot everything and got into a new relationship , they must be thinking that one can live with sweet memories also and be happy about it in place of finding out another option , but people do have different openion.<br>                            as to find out solution of your dilemma , you should try to bridge this gap betwwen the families, as you anyone can't change your grandpa's decision. Secondly as you mentioned that your mom could not spend much time with you, then your grandparents , that is because she must be busy with her job , giving you and the family financial freedom probably , while she had full faith on her parents that they will take care of you and at that time they must be free to spend time with you.So do not have any negative feelings about your mother. Time is the biggest heeling medicine , so concentrate on your studies and whenever possible talk to your mom , as you are the greatest strength for her and she may have become insecure after seeing your stand with your grandpa's side.Tell her that you still very close to her and respect her , but everyone has right to live the way they want. Things will be fine smoothly .|`|vjB9ARWmaa	ur uncles are junkies and ur mums a drunk, maybe they should be sent to rehab? it would stop the drama.
xp8pmKOuaa	Are worried about it because you are doing something with her?  That should be your first question.  If you are worried about it because you are afraid of what other people think, then don't be.  As long as there is nothing going on sexually between you two, you have nothing to worry about.  You love her as your sister, and you only have one bed.  It's not uncommon to sleep in the same bed with your relatives, it doesn't matter how big the bed is.  I wouldn't be concerned about it.  As long as both of you are comfortable with it, you are fine.  Happy Sleeping!|`|j0mI8l07aa	My sister or your sister? :)<br>  Nah seriously though...<br>  Depends on how hot your sister is, and how much tossing and turning you do while sleeping. If you wake up with your hand on her breast and morning wood poking her in the thigh, it might get a little awkward.|`|1UwfrVA0aa	it is not good because, sleeping time you cannot watch that either she is your sister or girl friend  and  sleeping time you do not control your body .|`|KSYbJZd0aa	Nothing's wrong with it at all. She's just your sister and you guys are just using the bed to sleep till morning comes, so whatever.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	No it's not.<br>  <br>  Sharing a bed does not have to involve anything sexual.

They continue to stay even though they are miserable.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	I think this could be true if the couple are not very well suited, but if they are I think the marriage will be much stronger than the first.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I hope not.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Statistically yes. Second marriages are more likely to end in divorce than firsts (50% for first and 65 - 70% for seconds), and are generally of a shorter duration. <br>  That's not to say it can't work, just that you are under the gun, and need to work harder to get it right.|`|GqTSa85daa	I don't believe so, though the same could be claimed about women.  I divorced my first for infidelity and my second divorced me for the same.  How soon we forget.|`|dJoE8yedaa	No. It depends on if they complement each other in the relationship. If they do then it has a chance to last forever.|`|N6dT8LE5aa	My best friends husband divorced his first wife for sleeping with everyone but him. He has been married to my friend for over 20 years now.|`|AA12185240	Don't believe everything you read
xp8pmKOuaa	It's something that you have to decide for yourself.  The advice I would give you is to seriously consider how much you trust your best friend and what she is doing.  I had a friend once who hung out with druggies and drop-outs, etc.  She was my best friend, and I thought I could trust her.  Then she started failing school, skipping class, doing drugs and asking me to come with her.  I stopped talking to her, and she dropped out of my life, but I felt a lot better about it.  Much as I miss her, I didn't want to let myself fall into the same trap she had fallen into.  If you think that your friend is seriously endangering your life, I would talk to your family, and possibly the police, and cut ties with your friend.  Your life is more important than a friendship that someone might compromise for a gig.  The people that your friend is hanging out with are not people that you want to be associating with, so why associate with her?  Ultimately, the decision is yours.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I would ask yourself these questions first. do you love her? do you want to marry her? is she good mother material? do you trust her with being faithful? does she value your feelings? if 3 out of 5 are no I would say you need to ask her to go.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	stop hanging around with them, Seems like trouble to me|`|qiHNnZh7aa	yes you should be concern about yourself and the first fault goes to you you should have choosen a friend wisely anyway try to get rid of this friend as smoothly as you can|`|ncWV2FwLaa	well atleast they will know what house to rob when they run out of money.get you some dogs and don't let no one be around them but you.don't let people pet them.and find some new friends|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	If you mix with people like that - it rarely has a good outcome.

2pNHOCONaa	what is better? let me consider how life is without being committed to anyone. first and foremost, there is definitely more freedom being single, and less pressure on changing to be better. <br>  there is no one really telling you there's something wrong with you. your little flaws, little things you do, it can be overlooked by who you're hanging out with as opposed to having a boyfriend/girlfriend. no one to argue with, no one to cry about, no one to be feeling jealous towards, not too much responsibility on what another person is feeling.<br>  being single almost actually feels like you're floating. as you're free to date, free to stay up all night with people you consider friends or even with just acquaintances, you're free to flirt with whomever you think looks cute, simply put, you're free to do whatever you choose to!<br>  because there is no one you need to consider in making your decisions but yourself.<br>  <br>  being in a committed and serious relationship, there will be jealousy. every move you make, you have to think about your partner if he/she would agree if i did this, would this hurt him/her or would he/she not mind? it takes up a lot of your time to even just genuinely listen to what your partner is saying what he/she did yesterday. and sometimes it is exhausting! because love takes work. love is consistent. and love is especially painful at times. and even at the beginning of it all, before you actually choose to risk asking the person to be your partner, you're setting yourself up to possibly get hurt and be rejected, or even be more alone than you used to be. but if you go through with it despite all fear of being hurt and embarrassed, if by all odds, he/she says yes! then you begin to be in a relationship, the pressure begins. because were all unique even though were all so similar. inevitably, there will be conflict. and things that never bothered you before about your own personality will begin to show themselves that it is not OK, and your partner will eventually tell you this. and you with him. were you not in a relationship, you both would not have noticed it. to me, this is a good thing. because we dont really begin to be better unless we realize were not. i love being criticized, because sometimes i don't realize i do something hurtful or wrong unless someone tells me. and being in a relationship, this is inescapable, imminent even.<br>  <br>  and you will be hurting each other, because your boundaries will be crossed, should you be guilty for hurting your partner? don't forget, he chose to be with you as well. and sooner than later, you see who you both are. meaning, you realize your limits, what pisses you off, what pisses him/her off! what makes you happy? what makes you cry. why does it make you cry. and when you hurt, you're not hurting alone, you suffer together. and you figure it out together. you compromise. but whether or not you end up with this partner you chose to be with or you don't, what matters is, you got to know yourself better. and the better you know yourself, the sooner you get to better who you are. and it would not have been possible if you chose to live life on your own. at least the revelations wouldn't happen sooner than if you were In a relationship.<br>  <br>  yes, it is Fun being single. and like i said, it even almost feels as if were floating, like a bird. so free from so much emotional responsibilities. but i would rather be in a relationship than be single. but then again, if there isn't anyone willing to commit to and be in a relationship with me? why the heck force it?! :)<br>  <br>  genuine love isn't dependence, i keep saying saying this over and over again, when we tell our partner that i cannot live my life without you! or if you leave me, i am going to die!<br>  that's a lie. i mean, you existed long before you ever met the guy/girl! this is not love, it's parasitism. instead what genuine love is is when you both have accepted individually that you can live without each other, But you both Choose to be together. :)<br>  (i am quoting the late M. Scott Peck, M.D, from his book the road less traveled)<br>  <br>  and to quote dr. peck once again,<br>  <br>  If you move out to another human being, there is always the risk that that person will move away from you, leaving you more painfully alone than you were before. Love anything that lives--a person, a pet, a plant--and it will die. Trust anybody and you may be hurt; depend on anyone and that one may let you down. The price of cathexis[Cathect, -verb. to invest emotion or feeling in; an idea, object, or another person] is pain. If someone is determined not to risk pain, then such a person must do without many things: having children, getting married, the ecstasy of sex, the hope of ambition, friendship--all that makes life alive, meaningful and significant. Move out or grow in any dimension and pain as well as joy will be your reward. A full life will be full of pain.

But being single is fun too.|`|Gh3UYjBJaa	It depends on the relationship. You can gain allot of satisfaction from a healthy relationship especially if the two of you are not only lovers but friends as well. There are so many fun and entertaining experiences in life and being able to share them with a special individual can be all the more fulfilling. Being single is fun as well with the freedom to date who ever, flirt with who you please, go wherever, ect. The thing is when your find yourself in a meaningful relationship you usually fall in by accident. You find yourself choosing to spend more and more time with a particular individual rather than perusing other interest. Sharing your time with them begins to take priority over other activities and before you know it your in a relationship. Which is great if that’s were you want to be which it probably is since your making the choice to be there. I think some individuals begin to dislike the idea of a relationship when one party becomes possessive and controlling over what the other wants to do, is aloud to do, or chooses to go.  Or one finds that the responsibility of sacrificing certain endeavors, experiences, ext  to maintain their relationship outweighs the benefits of having one, possibly drawling the two individuals apart.  Relationships are often about compromise and if you find that you and your partner have allot of interest in common, the task of compromising may not be so daunting.

YBIiEF3Paa	oh yea people can be mean like that, they actually don't like to compliment the hot people cause they themselves are so ******* insecure, that complimenting someone makes them weak. Most of the people are like this, only a few with very big heart will tell you for real.<br>  <br>  I think  a person might be hot but he may not even know that, how we perceive ourselves comes from a lot of things like how we have been treated in our childhood and if we grew up in a negative or positive environment. That is why you see a lot of 'NOT HOT' people think they are all that and a lot of 'HOT' people don't even know if they are hot.<br>  <br>  We can only know this by the opposite sex's reaction.<br>  <br>  So the only way is to love yourself no matter what. It doesnt matter what the world thinks. The way we percieves ourselves and the way the world percieves us can be totally different but in the end what really matters is how you treat yourself. That is what MATTERS.<br>  <br>  Woo. i hope you get what i mean.|`|HkgTtCMyaa	sooner or later your mind wont play tricks and you will REALIZE YOUR HOT AT age 19 I REALIZED HOW ****** HOT I AM WHEN I SERIOUSLY BELIEVED I WASNT ITS CRAZzzzzzzzzzzzzzY|`|JdpYMDQpaa	I'm not being egotistical or arrogant.

RDfOZUgwaa	I've been in something kinda similar. You need to think whether you miss her specifically or miss being in a relationship. If something made you want to get out, that might still exist. If you just miss having someone and the convenience of being intimate, whatever that may be for you, then that's not a good reason to get together.<br>  <br>  If you seriously miss her due to her personality, humour or whatever else about her specifically, then I'd say try it again.|`|wKI80UNhaa	i'm in the same boat you are right now!! and it was exactly three weeks ago my boyfriend and i broke up too.. and he's already found someone new. and we were dating for about a year. its hard to cope with the issues of being in a break up situation. i personally hate it so much!! i can't take being in a break up.. cuz you constantly think about them. but i think the best way to get over the break up, is talk to her about it, tell her you made a huge mistake IF YOU WANT HER BACK. but if you feel you don't get enough freedom when your with her, i'd lay back and relax and stay out of a relationship until you're actually sure you're ready to move on.. <br>  <br>  help??|`|0eec53554da8e3da419e6164f3e02eeeaa	yeah, it natural to go through this, you just have to rethink the whole situation and evaluate whether or not u actually miss her or if its just the thought of being alone, think of the reasons why you broke up in the first place and determine if you can look past them or not. hope it helps!|`|LfLM4fzYaa	need to move on, many other beautiful girls|`|lHuofownaa	sometimes in life we take for granted what we have ,<br>  until we lose it,|`|sU2NayEcaa	never been there.....but hey, if you want to get back to her, apologize and start over again? can you? just say something like: I missed my freedom, but I'm wrong, so I decided to get back to you...|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	no, just you.|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	ok lemme just say that what you are missing is the companionship not the female in question. you like being loved. but not smothered. you like calling the shots but not following, you have no true business being in a relationship until you see what it is that makes you happy, otherwise every woman you run across will make you unhappy. sorry for your loss I know it hurts real bad but do some soul searching in time you'll heal up just fine|`|GHZnLiYvaa	It's natural to feel so. If you still like her and have feelings for her, I would suggest you to talk it out with her. Atleast find out how is she doing. That will show that you really care about her.|`|2dJIJr6uaa	if you still have feelings for ther then try talking to her, you never know she may feel the same! good luck|`|VCX7S3d6aa	Grovel my friend, best way to go !
YyMUz1naaa	Oh boy, everyone will be jumping all over you over this one...<br>  <br>  I would ask yourself - why was he unhappy in the marriage? Had he and his wife grown apart over the years and he was just 'sticking' it out for the kids? Or did his wife mistreat him some how? I'm sure there is something that he told you that he was unhappy about within the marriage, right?<br>  <br>  How do you know that he will find his "true happiness" with you? What if you just ignited a spark that he hadn't felt in a long time because of his comfort with his wife? Sparks and infatuation come and go....but what will you be left with? <br>  <br>  I'm not going to say that yes he will screw you over too, because we can't predict the future. I'm just saying that you should consider what has happened and if it were *me*, I'd say a red flag would be going up.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	I come from a family, mum, dad and brother, sisters. I can tell you now, if someone like you came along and seduced my dad, it would have broken the whole family apart and god knows what type of people my brother and sisters be today.

Some say - never create the opportunity.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well that is hard. He allowed himself to fall for you. He was married and still allowed you both to connect even as friends. As a respectful thing, you did ruin his marriage, and it would be better if you didnt pursue anything with him...<br>  But life works out in weird ways. Their divorce is what you need to talk to him about. You need to ask him to be honest and tell you what really ended it. Were they happy to begin with.... and so on.<br>  <br>  If it was because of you, be very careful. Because its possible he would do that to you as well.|`|8fXoctcjaa	You ruined his life, his wife's life, his child's life, and your only concern is your life. <br>  <br>  Wow!<br>  <br>  Are you really Lovin' Life?<br>  <br>  Exactly how can you look at yourself in the mirror and not vomit?|`|lckgvz2laa	What happens a few years down the road when he does the same thing to you?

My wife and I met when I was still married, and I divorced and married her. For 8 years she started fights and accused me of cheating on her when I had no such thoughts until finally tired of being accused, I did it. I later repented of it and confessed to her and asked her forgiveness and re-dedicated myself to the marriage. Now nine years later, she has started an affair and has thrown me out. People will use any excuse to justify themselves and if there isn't one they will manufacture one.
6kts0SaVaa	She has feelings for you but you need to give her more time. Be more understanding and loving. Just be good friends for some more time. And besides one more thing don't always wish to be physical when she is with you. Sometimes girls like emotional bonding more than physical. Always kiss her on her forehead whenever she meets you. Keep on telling her that you love her and care for her, not directly but in indirect ways. I think she is going through something tough internally. So please be supportive.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	in order to figure out if she haz feelings for youus why don't you be straight up and ask her instead of analyzing every single thing she does?
f8ON3dRfaa	She's either insecure about herself, or likes to hear different people complimenting her.<br>  <br>  As for you, complimenting her time & again would seem to be done out of obligation on her end. Meaning "Ya, you're my bf, of course you'll say I'm pretty. No biggie." <br>  <br>  Do let her know how you feel, truthfully, and don't go on and on about how shallow it is to get others to judge based on looks, bla bla bla... <br>  <br>  Sit her down nicely, ask her, what can you do to make her feel confident about herself and that all the rating stuff about her makes you feel belittled. And no, it's not wrong. If I were you, I would feel the same.|`|mY0sSIQDaa	Yes. Obviously if shes asking for others opinions she feels insecure with low self-esteem. Shes not trying to belittle you by asking people if shes pretty, she just wants an unbiased opinion. And the not liking other girls looking at you links back to the insecure thing, maybe she thinks that if you find someone prettier than her then you'll leave her.|`|X2Ks0tfHaa	Yeah its strange that she needs reassurance of her looks from other people...think only a girl can give you an answer on this one|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Get her told, she's being a SL*G!!|`|ZGHl5FITaa	She shouldn't do that, its probably just low self esteem or something. Try complimenting her more and tell her how great she looks. And if you really want to take her shopping and let her try on some clothes. Hope that I helped.

AA12135516	I think too many people start having sex far too young, so good on you for being 18 & still a virgin because in years to come you will be really glad you waited.

o65klEwWaa	WTF alright. Who pees everywhere? The dog or the brother?<br>  <br>  Sadly you can't write the rules when it's not your house, and although I think your bf could stand up for the two of you a bit more, he is probably at a disadvantage because he is lucky to be allowed to have you stay in the house with him. You don't want him to risk that just at the moment when you need to stay there.<br>  <br>  Just be brave and deal with it in a mature way.

ZnHTfNycaa	I was happier after I got married, I still am! My situation may be a bit different though.<br>  I came from an extremely abusive and dysfunctional family. Both of my parents were married and divorced 3 times. Also I have 6 siblings, none of them being my biologically whole siblings, only half-siblings. It's a big mess and I'd be here all day explaining it! But you get my point.<br>  When I met my husband, he really was like my knight in shining armour. He never had a father in his life, so he could somewhat identify with the pain I felt growing up. But at the same time, the rest of his family was extremely loving and supportive. So he came out being an incredible man.<br>  He was the only one in my life who wanted to be there for ME. Trust me, we did have our ups and downs just like anyone else. We had a lot of curve-balls thrown at us through out our marriage. But we kept hanging on. <br>  I know it sounds corny, but he is my rock. He is the only one that keeps me going day after day...with a smile on my face. <br>  He really did change my life. And now I have the lovely family that I've always wanted. So yes, I am much happier after getting married!|`|wi6mkT30aa	Happiness comes from within. You can't just be happy because of marriage, money, jewlery and things like that. Sure those things help make life more fun and happy but if you're not happy already without those sort of things then that doesn't change it much. Being happy is just something that should be always. Wake up everyday and be thankful for the life you are given.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|SckWdjnVaa	It takes two to tango....especially in marriage!!!

Ow6lKFXiaa	I agree with Justice, follow his advice.  I went through the same, and worse, with my sister over my wedding.  Your sister is a control freak.  She wants it all her way or no way.  When you refuse to give in to her control, she twists things around so they look like your fault and uses manipulation and guilt to get what she wants. Your statement "as usual, she has everything revolving round her" speaks for itself. My sister is also vindictive and claims I deserved whatever mean thing she did as "revenge" for getting her mad.<br>  <br>  You've done way more than is justified to make amends while she's not made a single effort.  This is part of her manipulation.  The ball is in her court now.  Back away and plan your wedding the way you and your fiance wish.  It's your wedding not hers...she has no say in it no matter what she believes. Don't let it spoil your happiness.<br>  <br>  If she gives you the silent treatment, accept it as a gift and enjoy it while you can. If and when she's ready, let her come to you.  Accept her back and never mention this incident again, but don't expect any apologies as you won't get them.  I'm willing to bet this is not the first time this has happened, although probably the biggest.  I'm also willing to bet it won't be the last.<br>  <br>  Good luck! You're going to need it.  My best wishes to you and your fiance.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	bitchslap her!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eFkdCBjkaa	She is a selfish spoiled brat.. tell her .. "you are my sister and I love you, but I will not let you ruin my wedding or disrupt my life. If you want your sister back, I'm here when you decide to grow up and out of it." Let it go babe. She'll come around if she has any sense at all. Stop giving in to her ridiculous behavior. She doesn't get how important family is...hopefully she will before it's too late.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Ah, once a sister always a sister. Sounds normal though, get an extra dress for her to wear in the wedding (if you can afford it) and if she wants to be there and wear it then good if not, her loss. This is your special day not hers. Of course she is jeallus and she probly will stay that way for a while! But you and your fiance deserve to be happy. I always go to Halmark and buy a cute smarmy card when I fight with my mom, sister or boyfriend! Get one you know will make her cry!|`|j7fzuDxgaa	hello there could you both wipe the slate clean and start again no blaming each other. no "but you said this you did that" just forget it start again agree to disagree and leave it at that. if you would still like her to be brides maid then ask her again maybe you could both write your ideas about the brides maid down and meet half way. having said that its your big day and not hers so on  the other hand you could tell her you would love her to be your bridesmaid but its your big day and you would love her to be part of it and if she does not want to be your respect her choice but you really want her to be because this is a big day in your life and she is a big part of your life. we all say things we did not mean or should not have life is to short we don't know how long we will have the people we love around. good luck|`|mSjXW7Puaa	As you said that she was going to be your bridesmaid, then started making all decisions then got hurt you didn't wanted what she had decided. This shows that earlier she use to make decisions for you , and you must have accepted many of them ,so as a habit she did it again , but this time you did not like it . So she must be thinking it is because of your marriage. She is possessive for you as a sister, which is natural, but in her case probably it is too high. For all the other occasions it looks the same so try to balance things in a way which will make her secure and she will feel that your marriage or your new relationships will make no difference between your relationship with your sister. Try to save this relationship , as breaking a relation is easy you may or she may get 10 reasons , but making and continuing relations is delicate , it nothing but just to show importance to each other . Spend time with her with your family, let them interact with each other .Proper communication is the key. Keep relationship one to one .|`|XGp3oF5baa	I went through the same thing with my sister. I had all my bridesmaids wear flats cause my husband isn't the tallest in the world. And she got so mad about it! Who gets mad about wearing flats instead of heels? Just tell her that it is your day and when her day comes, if it already hasn't, then you will be there for her too. If she still acting the same forget about her. It is your day be happy and enjoy the process. Don't let her ruin it for you. Good luck hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Did I mention she was older than me and was just mad that I was getting married before her. Maybe your sister is just mad about something stupid like that and is causing her to act that way.
YrrtMS5Taa	Both. We should blame society for encouraging this and saying it's okay for kids to be having sex whenever they feel like it, meaningful relationship or not. We should blame the parents for not teaching him it's NOT okay, not teaching him about protection, and letting him sleep over at this girl's house.<br>  <br>  Of course the same goes for the girl. It's not like it's just the boy's fault.|`|mjy4oRvDaa	Yeah... it's your neighbor's fault that their kid's having sex.  After all, your neighbor's part of "society."

You just haven't reached an emotional maturity to have a stable relationship. You're still looking for someone but don't know what you're looking for. <br>  Psychology states that girls look for their father figure in their partner, while boys look for their mother figure in a girl.<br>  A Father Figure is usually considered to be an older man, often one in a position of power or influence, who arouses emotions usually felt for a person's father and with whom a person identifies psychologically<br>  That doesn't necessarily mean you will like older people. You're just more likely to be attracted to someone who has the same qualities as your dad.<br>  Interpersonal attraction is the attraction between people which leads to friendships and romantic relationships. The study of interpersonal attraction is a major area of research in social psychology. Interpersonal attraction is related to how much we like, love, dislike, or hate someone. It can be viewed as a force acting between two people that tends to draw them together and resist their separation. <br>  If you like someone and then they start liking you and you interact, probably you stop liking them because you actually get to know them better. <br>  We usually project an image on a person and that's why we like that person, because we don't know who he really is, rather, we portray him as who we'd like him to be. When we discover he isn't what we believe at all, our interest vanishes.<br>  You will have to learn what you really want from a person and eventually you will meet someone who satisfies your needs. Until then you'll be trapped in this game of liking and getting bored.<br>  It's all about self reflection and experience.<br>  Good luck!|`|uKB6lOowaa	haha ur love life sounds like mine.<br>  find someone else that doesnt go 2 ur skool or work and its attached to ur friends.<br>  it worked 4 me :)|`|TEpWDP1aaa	just ask the next guy on a date and you might find out you like him.|`|AA12316366	what's the problem? you are a scatterbrain.|`|IPS3hWweaa	When someone likes you, you should date them and discover what kind of person they are instead of ignoring them.

PuPQF8QIaa	Invite him along with the things you and your friends do and vice versa (except for romantic dates) but if you're just snagging a movie, or goin out for a few drinks, there's no reason everyone can't hang out and have a good time, or if your friend outings are overly girlie, I'm sure he won't mind sitting out on occasion..<br>  <br>  Keep in mind not to be that "annoying couple" when you're doing the group thing. Keep the P.D.A. PG13 or lower.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Work out how often you need each of these things. How often do you want to see your friends, once per week?

The other day we were just fooling about and without even properly trying it just happened, i'll admit it was painful, but not excruciating, and because I was "wet" it was much easier.

Hymen is broken not while having the sex for the first time.  It gets ruptured even while you do strenuous work or play game like skipping rope.  But some day your hymen has to get broken because how long your husband is going to evince patience - after you have to fulfil his conjugal rights.  Whatever be it, you have to embrace this responsibility and come through it.  At least think of bliss of sex that you may have it once you have crossed over this obstacle. So do not think lamely or do not take refuge in procrastination.  You can not escape this tentative in the guised in the  conjugal duty towards your husband.  So go and get going and fly high in the heavenly ecstasy.|`|ixmaM395aa	Ok the good news is... it may already be broken!!!

ixmaM395aa	Wow you're one of a kind you know that. Not many guys would stick by their ex in something like this. Personally, I think moving on so quickly the herpes has come back to her as bad Karma. <br>  <br>  But I also know the power of love a child can bring & bond between two people. <br>  <br>  If she does stay with her boyfriend then it's probably out of fear she'll never get another partner because of the herpes. So you need to find out if this would be her reasoning for staying with him. If it is, then she needs to understand that as long as she is honest with a guy she's at least got some chance. <br>  <br>  I still can't get my head around how supportive you're being. But just be there for her, like you are, the shoulder to cry on and give her some support. Who knows, maybe this will be a wake up call for her and she'll realize she reciprocates your feelings and you two can work things out. <br>  <br>  Hope it all goes ok and she tests negative :)|`|v7XLArZraa	Most likely she gonna go with her bf to do the tests and not you.I say you should forget about having a bf/gf relationship with her mother/father relationship with your son. You should only care about your son F*#k her. Seems like you need to get a new gf yourself. Just make sure she's hotter than your ex.|`|Vy3QlUA9aa	i don't mean to make u nervous, but I am wondering if she started cheating on you with this BF of hers while she was still having sex with u.  You  need to get tested urself before you get a new GF.  I hope you come negative because you sound such a great guy.  But never be too good.  Even God has no compassion for those who transgress against him with such audacity.  If you continue to be so naive under the disguise of Love, then you will learn the hard way.  She will play you again.  That, you can write it down!!<br>  <br>  All the best|`|SxI6y9GWaa	Well, aren't you a nice man.  Don't have unprotected sex with her in case you catch whatever she's got too.  Go with her for the tests and hold her hand and be there for her.  Regularly see your child so he/she knows that you love him/her - and leave your girlfriend to sort herself out.  You obviously want to get back with her but are sensible enough to realise that this won't happen if you try and force the issue.  I suggest you concentrate on your own life and become independent of this girl while still keeping in touch because of the baby.  The new b/friend sounds a complete waste of space and eventually she will realise this, but may not necessarily come back to you.  Focus on yourself for a change rather than be on her piece of string.  No woman admires a doormat so don't become one.
SxI6y9GWaa	Your best bet is to avoid her.  Your first paragraph indicates to me that she wasn't interested in you originally.  However, you declaring yourself to her has roused her interest a bit and she's playing with you now which is quite a pleasant sensation for you and very flattering to her but you could go on like this forever without getting anywhere with her.  If you completely back off she will either go back to not being interested and although you won't get the flirting and attention, you won't be disappointed in it going nowhere either.....OR.... you will REALLY arouse her interest and she'll chase you which could be rather nice couldn't it.|`|0PsnnVb6aa	you shud ask her again and mention the *** slapping incidents...if she still wants to stay friends then you shud find someone who'd do all this wen being in a relationship wid you...it'd be easier then!!! and plus you wud'nt be so confused...so ask her..bst of luk!!|`|zamnZmOPaa	she probs cant help fliting or she doesnt think she is just like people say i flirt when i never wanted to so yeah thats a posiblity

Weren't you friends before dating/marrying them?<br>   I have found that sometimes a "friendly" breakup/divorce is easier (and a lot better for everyone) than a "nasty" one. They are especially easier for the children.<br>   Even if you are married (or with someone new), they should understand what was there but also trust why it is over now and that it is over now. In some cases, I have heard, the new spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend and the ex are actually friends first, or become friends later. <br>   There is nothing wrong with being friends with an ex.|`|AA10426129	nope if you do you only show you can't move on and have no respect for your new spouse|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	No!!<br>  <br>  Its the best thing for each of you to give each other a break!<br>  <br>  and also for the reason you said as well!!|`|X2Ks0tfHaa	Depends how it ended...im still in contact with some of my ex's does'nt mean I go meet them for drinks...if they meant alot to you then why not?|`|UmXQjbzCaa	no, its a bad idea, i tried to stay in contact with mine (she wanted to stay friends)... 3 days passed with my new gf and my ex was asking questions galore, finally ended horribly between me and ex and we never will speak again<br>  <br>  ur better to break all contact, ur ex is gonna get very nosey when u get a new love (even if they try to pretend like they are happy for u, they are just trying to weisle their way into your social life and will try to put down your new gf/bf)|`|w6DJj1a8aa	but what if i do marry with my ex???? what do you think i should just let it go for real cause i do still love him like i did before i mean if he is with someone else then i can look at someone else the way i did him anyways what do you think lol|`|CcgDj9GIaa	You're right, it's not a good idea; unless you and your ex have a child together.

See how it just keeps getting more and more inflated? That's a since of Narcissistic personality disorder (sounds harmless but is LETHAL to everyone around this person) as well as a sign of Borderline Personality Disorder and other disorders also.....but what is really worrying is the threats and the "hit list"......that puts her in the sociopathic and psychopathic realm.<br>  seriously.<br>  Sounds extreme I know,but, what you've typed above is exactly how sociopaths and psychopaths are.<br>  Seriously.<br>  <br>  You can't help her. These people get "help" when they wind up in jail for some reason and rarely rarely ever before.<br>  <br>  Don't question her ever, don't doubt what she says, and don't ever try to talk to her about help....you will be deemed an "enemy" and quite frankly - as you are well aware - these people are unstable.<br>  <br>  I suggest you limit your contact with her as much as possible in an unobvious manner. When she calls just always be "busy" or be in "the whower".  Sadly, when you think your finally rid of her (like no contact for 2 or 3 years) she'll suddenly show up on your doorstep with 3 years worth of lies and drama and then eventually you'll notice it will turn to anger and then you'll have to start being "busy" all over again.<br>  <br>  This will probably now be a permanent part of your life.<br>  <br>  Consider yourself "warned".
AA11198190	To achieve our goals.....most times we have to make sacrifices.<br>  l think you are rather fortunate to have an aunt who has taken you under her wing,and wants you to succeed.<br>  l would say she is protecting you from letting your life goals slip away.One day ...hopefully you will be able to understand her ....fine reasons.<br>  Hang in there.Life is good.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	for someone who is allegedly so highly intelligent, you sure aren't very smart. why aren't you on your own.  you make choices in life that are good or bad. if you are putting up with this for the money then i have no advice for you whatsoever.|`|O8I09JG2aa	You certainly seem to be a mature and sensible person. You have analyzed your situation very well - in identifying that though there is a problem, your aunt has struggled to whatsoever extent in getting you to where you are. You haven't shown a bit of resent against your aunt, but just are worried about the way things are and about how it would be in the future - so first of all, hats off.<br>  <br>  You are right, this is just a phase in your life - which seems to be dragging on for a while. There soon would be a time when things will change forever. Once your aunt sees you've all grown up and independant she is sure to respect you for it. She can and will NOT control you forever - or rather you wouldn't let her do it when you get independant. Don't let these bitter experiences shatter your academics a bit, as you seem to be doing very well. There may be a hundred reasons why your aunt behaves this way - though it is not justifiable - but just ignore that and don't waste time analyzing it. Life changes very fast for everyone - so you will have your good days soon.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	everyone thinks there parents / guardians control their lives. i always get ripped to shreds over nothing and im not allowed to do ANYTHING. i live with my grandparents but my mum is too much of a pushover for me. its so annoying.|`|mSjXW7Puaa	As you mentioned you achieved success , and are among good students , i guess a bit of credit you can give to your aunt also. You may feel that she is treating you differently then her own kids , that may be because you are her responsibility and she took it seriously , she wants you to succeed in life so she must be asking you to constrate on your goals not destract your mind with getting involved with friends.If you will be successful , she will gain nothing out of it except a satisfaction that she did her job well . Even if you feel that she is treating you differently , siblings also feel the same sometimes that mom is paying more attention to the other brother or sister. So do not waste your time thinking this as you will never know what is the truth .Once you complete your graduation surely you will get good companion and you will start a good life . No aunt sacrifices for other's kids , you are fortunate to ahve a aunt like her . No one is perfect so ignore the things which you do not like about her and try to achieve your goals in life as you are a intelligent person.Surely she will give you all the freedom you want once you will complete your education . Everything will be fine.
AA10874030	I think get her the gift and card and apologise. Your friend was upset and taking the emotion of the day out of you for sure but I still think you should get her the gift just to stop this huff from going on any longer than needed. Although her brother was a scumbag, its still her brother and no doubt the shock of his sudden death has had an effect on your friend. So just be supportive during this difficult time and let her know that you are here for here if she needs you. She probably just wanted some reassurance from you and the sounds of a freindly familiar voice so she was dispointment and hurt when she couldn't get hodl of you. Just reassure and comfort her the best way you can and be a good friend. Don't let who was right or wrong get in the way. You shouldn't feel guilty though, it wasn't your fault but just repair the damage.|`|J2IQiBgQaa	I think you should try and make it up to her, <br>  it wasn't your fault,<br>  i hardly ever answer my phone either,<br>  but still, she's your friend. and she needs you.<br>  She wont be herself at the moment, because she will be sad. thats why she was quick to get angry with you. <br>  You just need to give her some time to calm down.<br>  Maybe if you got her a nice present, and a card. then maybe put it in her mail or something.. just so she knows your thinking about her.<br>  Dont ring her straight away, give her a few days to cool off.<br>  Then if she hasn't rang you by then, maybe give her a call and apologise and stuff :)|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Well, normally, I would never suggest a gift for such illogical behaviour. However, she has really good reason to be unstable and illogical. You did all that you could. Get her a card, yes, and have it sent to her house with the flowers. Don't deliver them personally. She will decide when she is ready to talk to you. Make sure that your card extends the offer of an open ear. I honestly don't think she meant this assault on you. You were somebody safe to take it out on. It won't be easy to be her friend for quite some time. But if you stick it out and stand back when you need to, she will come around. My thoughts are with you.|`|a1c9da4a2a6e971f43d988078b7d0b67aa	Your friend will probably need support at this time. She may have enough support from family but if she needs more then as her friend you should try to be there. <br>  <br>  I would advise steering clear of giving any opionions about the deceased brother as this is for your friend to come to terms with in her own way. If she is impressioned by other people it could harm the healing process.<br>  <br>  Just try to be a good friend and to be there in the ways you feel a friend should be.|`|yf1A2FHfaa	Dont blame yourself, it wasnt done on purpose. She dont know what she is doing at the moment grief is an unpredictable issue.<br>  I wouldnt want flowers or a card. Give her a call an mention sorry you were not there when she needed you.

And we worked in customer service! We ended up going out but it gets boring real fast, trust me.<br>  <br>  When somebody doesnt talk or act social, eventually people end up ignoring them. The main thing is that you need to give her lots and lots of attention, but it seems like you're already doing that. <br>  <br>  C'mon, we both know the real problem here. It's you. You haven't made her feel comfortable enough around you, and you haven't had the guts to tell her how you feel about her. You've got to realise that an introvert keeps everything bottled up inside them. EVERYTHING. If you think she likes you, then she LOVES YOU. Trust me.<br>  <br>  So, grow some balls and just do it. Tell her that you and some friends are going to the movies, and you were wanted to take her with you to see it.

zMMQVb3eaa	uhhh this is kinda hard i would tell her if she was in another country to ccome home and be with me and if my current girlfriend told me this depending on how much i like her i would accept it and help her out with it but thats only if i liked her a whole lot hope i  was some help good luck|`|UpK3boARaa	ask my ex if its my mine if not i dont care about her and if i was in love my current gf i would stay with her but only if i was in love not just liked her|`|ENVkTHEsaa	u have to figure this one out for yourself bud.... good luck!|`|estIQEVNaa	If she was in a different country, I'd want her to come back asap.

XmJZkFuMaa	Whenever I feel like that, I read baby blues and smile, because she understands SO well.  I also love this mother (see the link, it's great believe me), she understands.  She gets it.<br>  <br>  Your daughter will grow out of this stage before you know it and you'll get more sleep.  Try to nap when she does in the meantime.  So you let things go for a while... who cares?  As for exercising, maybe you can put her in a backpack or in a stroller and take her for a walk.  If not, eh, so it takes an extra year.  <br>  <br>  My hubby works nights, so yeah, I understand.  On his days off, he gives me a break, maybe your hubby can too?<br>  <br>  Add:  Just cuz it looks odd...

I am exhausted most of the time. My son is 3 with a huge Mommy complex, he follows me everywhere. Sometimes I'm afraid if I stop too quickly I'm going to have to give birth to him again to get him out. Also, I have an 8 year old daughter with a very active imagination. So, I too get called to parent teacher conferences about her believing she is a vampire. Its very overwhelming. Especially when my husband goes deployed with the military. Being the mommy is a full time job. Just hang in there, and DO get some you time. Your husband can handle the kids for a few hours each weekend for you to get out for bit. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I feel like that sometimes, unfortunately parenthood doesn't come with a detailed job description and manual.<br>  <br>  I love my children and would go to the ends of the earth for them, but sometimes it is really nice to have a little bit of "me" time, whether its a soak in the bath without interruptions, an afternoon at the hairdressers or a good night out on the tiles with the girls!<br>  <br>  Its a hard job being a mother.|`|ZIriZYDwaa	Oh honey, you need a girly day with your friends, bit of shopping, get your hair done, watch a film and a meal.<br>  <br>  After having children you can get stuck in a rut where everyone else is more important than you, but you are just as important cos you the one holding everything together.<br>  <br>  Spoil yourself x|`|yf1A2FHfaa	I'm afraid thats the 'joy' of being a mum. Everthing gets on top of you and nothing gets done. You need some serious 'me' time.<br>  WHY DONT YOU GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND?<br>  You need to recharge your batteries. Is there a friend you could go with? Can you ask someone to look after the kids, surely someone could, may be ask a member of family they must know you are going through a tough time. <br>  Nothing is impossible - go on try an sort a cheap weekend away you truly deserve it. Dont make excuses not to - think of how you can. Nothing expensive just a MUCH NEEDED BREAK!.
6oxRJwZWaa	Friends come and go and people make mistakes, but first thing you should do is drop your best friend be cause if she tried to steal your husband she is definitely not your friend. i can't say you went wrong only your friend. try to take a vacation to relax and take your mind off of this stuff.|`|669bRlkuaa	Yes, I have a friend named Brad and he is my worst enemy, I hate him and I want him to go die in a flaming garbage can.<br>  <br>  I need some help peeps   <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhNldlcEHFmwcfR2Ni0Ek0bAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090305001454AAQCq4E">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ouUkY2t7aa	I agree. My best friend is jealous of me and always wants to do the same thing as yours, race. But I always win, and I'm not even competing!|`|Hf6R5uevaa	Yes,that's true because your best-friend knows your secret.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	I totally do.|`|7Wu7P6aNaa	nah i dont think so<br>  <br>  ive had the same best friends since birth|`|AA11623179	yes!|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	depends on the situation. in most cases it is a very true saying. you ever heard of that song "smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend" and "backstabbers?" it just depends on the situation. if you know you have one of those types of "friends" yes you have to watch them because the saying is very true. don't leave a woman around your man if you know they're "iffy" like that. It's true when people say "i trust you baby but I just don't trust him/her." there is definite meaning behind that because you never know what that person is capbable of doing to manipulating the person you are in a relationship with to get what they want. All friends aren't like you. you don't get a lot of good friends like yourself. don't worry about competing with any other woman if you know your husband loves you, but if a woman is messing with your man you have every right to tell her to back off. that man is yours and if she's coming at him like that then that's a huge slap in the face to you. keep her away. u didn't do anything wrong. the problem is there are just a lot of screwed up people in the world that don't believe in doing the right thing. you deserve better friends than the bad kind of friends and you know it|`|chZFmJOPaa	They can be, yes. They have incredible power over your emotions and thoughts. They can be negative and ruin a lot or they can be positive and give you hope for things.<br>  <br>  Your best friend went after your husband? Yeah that sounds like a perfect example to that saying. They are close to you and can find ways to take your happiness away.<br>  <br>  You didnt go wrong, you just had a nut of a friend.|`|szX346DFaa	In my opinion, if the word "might be" is added to your sentence, then it is reflecting accurately the situations of best friends i.e. it should be "Your best friend MIGHT BE your worse enemy." <br>  <br>  Why i said so? <br>  <br>  This is because not all friends are your worse enemy. Take you for example, like you said, you are a true honest friend. So if happened that we become best friends, you will never be my enemy.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, there are friends who are merely pretentious and they have ulterior motives to become your best friends. There are friends who change throughout times. These type of friends if they really go against you, they will not only become your enemies but "worst" enemies! This is because they will take advantage on your or even hurt you without you realizing... why? For an obvious reason, he / she is your best friend and it will be your last thing to cross your mind that your best friend will do things to harm you!<br>  <br>  Based on the aforesaid two cents worth opinion, I agree if you say that "Your best MIGHT BE your worst enemy".|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Sounds like your best friend was never your friend at all. Sorry for your loss, but you are better off. I had a similar thing happen to me. After almost ten years, I found one of those friends on facebook and we started talking about the lies. The ones that I heard being told about me and the ones that he had heard about me from others. We finally clarified things. And after a lot of time, he matured enough to finally have this discussion with me. These friends that have been lied to, unfortunately all you can do is be pleasant to them when you see them. Let them fall away. Build new friendships, telling them the whole truth of the matter lest they meet any of the old crew. And someday, some of your old friends might re-enter the mix. Then you will have the opportunity to clarify things and hopefully, they will me mature enough to understand.|`|M2YXvH5waa	No, not really.|`|g6MiGWuJaa	maybe thats why i dont have a best friend except for hubby

When saying about love... meaning knowing the good and bad points of your the other-half and accept them. Toleration, it means forgiving the other person's things including those you don't like... self-repect, I guess everyone has such thing. <br>  <br>  Many celebrities have marriage which last for such long, no need for me to give examples here.

Sex is so wonderful and a health medium. However the Lord did not make everyone with equal horniness. Every individual has different sex appetite based on the way he/she was brought up, strictness about sex at home, childhood traumas like sexual abuse and age. <br>  <br>  However since your husband feels he can't keep up with you, you may want to consider slow down.

And if your husband is at the point where he is so sick and hates the fact that you’re obsessed with sex then you need to do something about this. Right now it's not important what we think but what is important is what your husband thinks. You must know that most of the time an obsession does become an addiction. And maybe you are at the point where your sex drive has become an addiction. Your husband told you that you should seek help and I also think that you should get help for this. If you don't get help and if you continue to be obsessed this way you will end losing your husband. Is that what you want? There is nothing wrong is getting help for this because this is something that can be controlled. So please don't take this lightly because if you don't want to ruin your marriage then get the help that you need.|`|096Nu3zsaa	he's complaining? wow maybe you should be asking if there is anything wrong with him.

In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.” It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again. It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building<br>  <br>  If we wanted better relations between Black and White that includes OTHERS, . Black people,  first have to come into a knowledge of self ORIGIN, GOD, HISTORY OF OTHERS.  This act on our part will earn the respect of self as well as others. It will ultimately help us to have better relations with those who see us as an unwanted burden in this society.  <br>  <br>  Some of us have a false love for the White woman, and some of us have a false love for the White man. Some want the former slave master’s woman because the former slave master has always had free access to our women, and some want the White man because he wields great power in the society.<br>  <br>  We must ask the question of those who have gone the way of having interracial relations, is the love a true love, or is it merely an acting out of a corrupted fantasy which is held by both Black and White? When we, as a people, are healed of our mental, moral and spiritual sickness, then maybe we can look across racial lines and see the true value and worth of one another. However, healing of the deadly diseases of White supremacy and Black inferiority has to take place first!<br>  <br>  LOVE is Highest Order of GOD.  What is LIFE? It is the activity that is in accord with the law under which we are created. LOVE is the creative force out of which life comes. To truly love is to live and to have true life is to exist in true love.  Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.<br>  <br>  So where there is love, love transcends our racial denomination or ethnicity. Love is the great power of transformation. I don't think that we can say when two people are so in love that they shouldn't marry one another.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	How about, one of you moves to the city where the other lives and you spend time in the same room getting to know each other ... you know, like REAL dating.<br>  <br>  How ELSE can you know anything about anyone, other than spending time with them?<br>  <br>  The odds are stacked against you in so many ways that I'm not going to list them.

jYMlAN4Paa	Revenge is never the answer. Why would you spend so much time on such a worthless thing? I can only see revenge being somewhat suitable if you were attacked, tortured, kidnapped or someone you loved was murdered. Even then, revenge doesn't solve anything.<br>  <br>  What you need to concentrate on right now and for the rest of your life is your child. Your child should be the most important thing in your life....not trying to get revenge. If he is the father, a blood test will need to be done to prove it and you should hire an attorney so you can get support for your child. You can tell your attorney about the other girlfriend but I doubt it will make much difference. The only thing that matters is your child and that he does his bit to take care of him/her.|`|1kfeghDDaa	Revenge will get you no where. I can completely understand how devastated you must be.

If he refuses then take him to court. try and be on speaking terms with him though for the sake of your child.<br>  <br>  As for your so called best friend I believe in the saying "what comes around goes around". If he cheated on you then he will most likely cheat on her.

1nL6p8zMaa	God helps those who help themselves.<br>  In other words, deal with it yourself.  And if you don't succeed try again and again.<br>  The main thing you need to do to truly find someone worthwhile, is to fix yourself.  You pull yourself up - to like yourself and be OK just being with yourself.  When you achieve that somewhat, you won't have to search or pursue a relationship.  They will come to you- drawn to your self sufficient aura-attracted because they want what you have, strength and to be at peace with themselves. People tend to draw away when they sense neediness.Also, If you're not content with who are how can you expect others to be content with you?  and why would they think that you would be someone other than the person they see before them? a person who is unhappy is an unhappy person. Who wants to be with an unhappy or discontented person?<br>  <br>  And consider the idea of talking to your doctor about how you feel.  Because it sounds like you could use some depression medication or treatment.  You may not believe that your problems could possibly be "fixed" so easily. I didn't think anything would just "fix" me either (not significantly) But I was wrong. It made a HUGE difference just like that- take a little pill and "WALL-LA!.

Remember this suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

I've honestly telling you that I don't have perfect days but I can say that I am at peace with that it didn't work. I've never been as close to death and you know what I know that most of my problems are the result of a chemical imbalance. I've finally found something that is helping me to feel better. Please get yourself to a  doctor. Your life is absolutly worth saving . I could try and give you the benefit of years of fighting the battle with depression ,but I don't know if I have the room to write it all.|`|PsKgjOHBaa	really, dont talk like that you must have friends and family.. could u imagine what it would do to them if you did something to yourself?? when you talk like that you also have to think of everyone, not just you. yeah it sucks you cant find a girlfriend, but dont get all upset over it, someone will come along eventually.. and dont mess up your job and going to school, its really not worth giving up just because you cant find someone. would you rather be like me and be cheated on repeatedly? and lied to EVERYDAY? and get freaked out on because of stupid stuff?? i dont think so, relationships arent all they are cracked up to be unless its with someone you knowww you want to be with for the rest of your life, really, focus on your school work and your job, girls love it, but really, my step dad killed himself when i was 10 years old, its not the way to go.. so just think about it long and hard, because i know thats really not what you want to do you have something good going for you right now, just let it ride out and you will find that someone for you.. trust me <3|`|eC8SBCp7aa	I've prayed over and over for God to send me that right person and for years i've been without a response...that is what you said...just checking hon'<br>  <br>  Who are you to tell God that you want your someone NOW.

UXEF3LsYaa	to start off, there are a few things I would try before running away.  some things that you might consider bringing up:<br>  <br>  1.  being at that school clearly isnt the problem and transfering you isnt going to actually help, its just a punishment, maybe you should try to get him to agree on a punishment that is a bit more fair.<br>  <br>  2.  forcing you to transfer schools puts ALOT of mental stress on you and if it comes to that theres a good chance your grades will only get worse.  It's traumatizing and way over the top when clearly your school has nothing to do with the problem.<br>  <br>  I'm probably going to be the only one to tell you this, but if he won't sit down and actually talk about what the problem is and how you can fix it together (which will probably be your best bet), why not go ahead and do something drastic?  your clearly not doing anything dangerous and making that kind of statement might atleast get him to talk to you about it.|`|6oxRJwZWaa	Well if you really want to stay near you friend and girlfriend as bad as you say you do then obviously you need to hit the books, running away will only show your father that you are immature and prove his point. Show your dad that you actually can change words are a dime a dozen. if you work hard and keep your mind on your goals you'll get what you want 100% guaranteed.|`|DgJWTPh9aa	well doin sumting extreme lik running away might change his mind...go to a place whre you know he will find you and maybe he'll gt ta idea tat u really dont want to leave tat skool|`|g6pqGjrkaa	I hope what you think to is bad.  If your parents governs you means that is only for your good.  Try to keep this in your mind and act accordingly.|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	I am sorry to hear that your father is giving you the message that you aren't worth much unless you get good grades. You should confront him on that. Let him know how it looks from your point of view. Will he change his mind? Not sure honey, but I am sure that running away won't go over well and the school won't let you illegally attend either. Sorry. My suggestion though is that you give a little too. Set that alarm clock and abide by it. Show your dad some good faith instead of begging him with empty promises. Do some studying too. Ask him for help and get him involved. Maybe he might feel better if he knew he could help you. Also, try looking at the real reason behind you not getting up on time. Why do you really do it? How can you fix the cause of the problem?
rB3ypCO4aa	It sounds like you have your head together. You made the decision to move out of a place that's bad for you and you are making it happen REALISTICALLY. LOTS of 16 year olds want to move,but you have a good job and friends and family in place to catch you when you stumble.<br>  <br>   All I have to say is this 1) Stay in school.$13.00 an hour is nice NOW,but if you ever want to turn that number into 20 or 30 or 40,you'll need an education.Whatever you do,don't quit and kid yourself that you'll go back later.Most people who quit get caught up in life and NEVER go back,or if they do,it's when they're 50.<br>  <br>   2) Always be honest.You say that you have a bro,a bf and 2 other friends on your side.Even if the bf doesn't work out,your bro will ALWAYS be your bro and your friends can be kept for life...if you're worth it. ALWAYS be there for your people,always be honest,always be willing to help them when they need it,always be a person willing to give.That's the way I am,and I'm telling you;it's the only reason I'm sitting here answering your question right now.Nobody loves a taker.<br>  <br>   3) You're gonna be ON YOUR OWN,and your doing it right!

zU9KQYmHaa	Don't Worry<br>  <br>  I have lived with a couple of women over the years, and I really like your gift idea!  Yes, giving him a lock of hair, or a ring made out of your hair is an outdated custom.  But, I think it's a great idea and can help prepare a man for life with a woman.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  If a man is to share living space with his lady (lol) he must first get used to the bathtub, shower, floor and walls being decorated in a feminine style. In other words: covered in a medium-thick layer of her fallen hair. <br>  <br>  A woman may try to take charge (and care) of her man and home with enthusiastic (and weekly) furniture realignment (or replacement.) She may suggest freshening up the decor by repainting walls (or having her man do so. She'll pick the colors, though.)  A female certainly brings that element once referred to as: "a woman's touch" into the house.  <br>  <br>  At the risk of sounding sexist or chauvinistic:  women are natural nest-builders and housekeepers!  They can't help it, like Alice on the Brady Bunch, or Hazel, the sweet old TV show maid.  It's probably in their Y chromosome or some other sexier part of their DNA.  They are just more tuned in to domestic life than men.  <br>  <br>  A man won't always notice the care she routinely takes of things.  For instance:  making sure she always leaves a fully soaked bath towel wadded up somewhere amongst the bedsheets before she leaves for the day.  A man would likely have just hung the thing up and not given it a second thought!<br>  Hope this helps you.  Good luck!|`|5itFktgLaa	I am 37 and let me tell you, i've never had that happen to me before.<br>  <br>  Obviously, she likes you too. Although the way in which she expresses herself is a bit weird, I must admit....<br>  <br>  I suppose I would feel awesome, not because i'm holding her hair, but because the girl i like likes me. Anyway, capitalise on the situation, and ask her out to coffee sometime (never fails, especially for an older gentleman).

d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Reason why I would never marry a man with baggage and drama even though I am divorced myself. Hypocritical? Maybe, but there are reasons for everything. I have a crazy ex husband and his new wife is even worse. Her actions are straight from the pits of hell. I have tried numerous times to bring peace and kindness her way but she is such a bitter and rotten person. I only want to get along with her and my ex for the sake of the children so we can all have peace in our lives. My ex's new wife likes dirty drama though. In fact she thrives on it! She continually interferes with mine and my ex husbands parenting plan even though she is not allowed to by law. She simply will not allow my ex husband to talk to me under any circumstances when the parenting plan says we must discuss certain things to do with the kids. He is very desperate and afraid of being alone so he listens to her. She even keeps her own kids hostage and won't let them go to real school but instead she tries to home school them in which she does a very poor job at. She won't let her kids see their real father either but doesn't mind collecting child support from him. The worse part is that this woman belongs to some church. She is not saved and I am glad I am not part of that congregation. I could never go to a church with that kind of jack@ss attending. Again, no, I would never get involved with a man that had an ex like my ex husbands new wife. When I remarried years ago, I married a single man with no baggage or drama. He by the way has no drama in his life now concerning my ex. I am the one who deals with the ex and his nasty other half.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	No it wouldn't change my mind, because she was HIS ex, not mine, and their issues don't belong to me.<br>  <br>  If i were with a man who let his ex badger him, i'd have my head examined.  Those of us with bitter ex's need to learn how to ignore and move forward with life.  Bitter ex's want negative attention.|`|chZFmJOPaa	It depends on how he handles it I suppose. My boyfriend's ex tries to contact him now and again to get him back. I trust him enough to tell her to screw off. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't say much about it or lets his ex do this....then yeah, I wouldnt stick around. <br>  <br>  But if he does attempt to ignore her, then it might be worth the shot. It just depends on how patient you are.

2pNHOCONaa	you want to tell him but you want to be a secret admirer? you cant have the cake and eat it too. <br>  <br>  ever heard of that saying? you have to choose. if youre willing to live the rest of your life wondering what it could have been if you only asked him? if thats ok with you? then Just Be an admirer.<br>  <br>  but if you are willing to take the risk and profess your love for the guy, despite the fact that its possible he could reject you and might even shy away from you, orrr of course the other possibility would be, it could work out because he might like you too, and you wouldnt be left wondering anymore because now you Know. not only do you know, be it a good or bad outcome, but you would also be reassuring yourself that you Did it! you were brave enough to risk it for someone. and youve proven to yourself that you are a brave person. that you did not choose the path of less resistance.. you were not lazy. but you were humble. and you were not scared. you didnt let your fear control you. you will only give yourself reason enough to love yourself more.<br>  then go for it! tell him. but remember, you need to do it for yourself if youre going to go through with it at all.<br>  <br>  the thing is, i dont know if you Do truly know what Love means. let me enumerate a few points,<br>  <br>  love is not dependence, love is not destructive, love is patient and kind. especially kind. <br>  if someone says i cant live without you? thats really a lie isnt it? i mean, you existed way before you ever met the guy!<br>  and saying that you cant live without the person, and i will die if you leave me is not really love. its romantic, but not love. its parasitism. and its not healthy either.<br>  <br>  what love is is separateness. meaning, the two of you individually have accepted that you can live without each other, that you would be ok if you were to let him go and him to let you go, But you both Choose to be together. that is love. a choice we make every single day. a choice we need to prove every hour of every day. it is absolute honesty, respect and sacrifice. so if you feel it is love that you have for this guy? i suggest that you tell him! <br>  <br>  but thats me.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Just be direct and straightforward.|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Wait until the moment when it rings so true in you that it just has to come out.<br>  <br>  But also keep in mind his comfort.

If you don't wanna flirt with him then writing notes is cool but make sure your hand writing isn't recognisable.<br>  <br>  There's lots of other little things you can do so email me if you have anymore questions.|`|dvdvX4AYaa	will just go and say it befoer itz too late i did the same thing i lost her u should go and tell him or close ur hears open ur moute and say it|`|Zdx6BA1Jaa	JUST TELL HIM ITS SIMPLE!:)

IXskJPlVaa	A 4 year relationship and such a short fuse. Don't worry - relax and let it cool down. It hurts but you can't help - just take it easy. A relation-ship that can not stand the test of time - is not worth it. It is a two-way thing and can not be sustained single handedly. So Just wait and see -it should be OK. Till then keep yourself busy in things you like. Best of luck.|`|d448LFtqaa	Get out while you still can.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	i cant believe i actually tried to read this.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	girl I think it is time to let go <br>  this man just use his way out so let it be<br>  4 years to let go like that. something is wrong

When she's not busy, make eye contact and smile.  If she smiles back sincerely, she probably wants you to talk to her.  An honest compliment never hurts, and you have an obvious interest in common to talk about.  Maybe she'd like to play racquetball with you?  <br>  <br>  Nothing is more appealing in my eyes than confidence, even if you have to fake it a little :)  You think you are a nice person, and you spend time at the gym so are probably in good shape- keep things like that in mind for a confidence booster when you're approaching girls.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	Wait about a month to start talking to them... unless they approach you first. :D If you go in as often as you say you do then you'll have a lady on her knees in no time.|`|1RqPa4RJaa	do what he said, except make it extremely obvious so that they know that you're trying to talk to them. you might even get some sympathy points if they think you're shy|`|mZVP36Rmaa	ask them if they got tickets to the big show..
36ORbCqLaa	Well, he is def. flirting with you. slapping on the butt is a gesture that secretly means he wants you.the again,it could just be harmless flirting. You need to pay attention to how he talks to you. Does he say sweet things or is he an ***? A guy that is really interested will want to impress you make you feel special. a guy that only wants one thing or is just "messing" with you tends to act like a jerk or a smart ***. Just make sure you never forget, DON'T CHANGE FOR NO GUY..there are plenty of guys out there and there will be plenty that like you. The ones that really care wont try to change you. You have to stay true to yourself, that is the most important thing. don't ever do anything you don't want. But if you are interested in this guy, one tip is to make him chase you. Let him know your interested, but just not how much you are interested. leave him wondering. Finding ways to keep him thinking about you is always a good thing. Well i don't know if that helped you at all but i hope it enlightened you in one way or another :)|`|YBIiEF3Paa	maybe...but a slap on the *** is weird.|`|iJa1gf0qaa	He sounds gay.<br>  Or he's just horny.<br>  Or he just thinks your hot.

And if he strays because of this then I'd be disgusted. I hope he doesn't force you to have sex?

I trust her and she trusts me.<br>  <br>  Trust is the beginning and ending of a relationship.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Talk to your husband about it!

Perhaps when your answer to him was not "probably because she is interested in you," he may have gotten a little discouraged.  The other side is he was just telling you the truth.  I do not know his age.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	I would feel the same way if it was near my anniversary ,he knows what he is doing ---why is a girl staring at a man ? maybe you should say  there is a new postman  who is always chatting to me  always seems to be handing me the mail what does this mean ? if it good for the gander it's good for the geese really just ask him straight out|`|N6dT8LE5aa	I would come out and ask him if he is thinking on having an affair with this girl or if he is sexual attracted to her. The first thing we do as women is pray he loves us enough NOT to cheat, when we should be getting to the bottom of it all.<br>  <br>  I would make a surprise visit all decked out looking good and sexy and I mean SEXY and make sure SHE knows without saying anything that he is YOUR man!|`|AA11623179	maybe he is just making you jelous. maybe he is just playing with you.... for a big surprise tomorrow.|`|Kec5I1Olaa	i'm very jealous. if my husband told me that i know that he loves me and wont do something stupid- but i still hate girls that like to flirt with married men-if they have something important to say they will do it but if not they just try and catch his eye and then move from there/- i put a stop to it- even if it means making a visit to her and telling her to keep a respectful distance and shell never have to see me again.

Maybe thats what he wants- for you to be jeoulous- but dont go after her unless she makes a move.|`|AA11314988	He wants you to get jealous. Tell him about your feeling and definitely he gonna like it. Don't let that questions bother you, trust your husband and just be yourself.

Congrats and wish you more happiness and blessings in your married life.|`|AA11491453	I'm pretty sure that your husband knows what it means when a woman is staring at him.  In my opinion he is trying to get a rise out of you, or make you jealous.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Have a great anniversary, and Congrats!|`|Cv0UkQVXaa	He is just trying to get a rise.

You are better off without him.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Your age and where you live would help. You can get a copy of your birth certificate without going there. Your dad could also do a DNA test and save you the trouble. If he wants to see you, this should not be a problem at all. Keep talking to people until you find the right one to help you. most will just give you robot answers and don't give a **** anyway. Keep trying! You're 20? There is no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to visit him...Father or not!  Is he on Death Row or something?? This makes no sense...|`|AKkfepINaa	It depends,  if u have your original birth certificate or not. I don't because they couldn't get mine so they made one up with my new parents and a different place I was from. Now I am 30 and about 4 years ago my real mom got in contact with me and she is weird, be careful! Look online and see if you can order one, you can go to the department of health and get one..

haabfMtkaa	I personally with a man who has been around the block or the virgin next door would NEVER be open about my PAST sexual history<br>  All men have a hard time with it!!!<br>  They all want pardon the pun "a lady on the streets and a freak in the bed"<br>  This is your personal history and with the exception of a STD it is private.<br>  We all have been with and done things we are not proud of don't be so hard on your self !!!<br>  If you feel like you may have a future with this man then don't bring up your past.<br>  If he asks you about it then be vague <br>  I think this is the one area that it is OK to lie <br>  My husband will NEVER no how many men I have really been with and I don't ever want to know how many women he has been with or the details for that matter. What matters is the NOW yesterday is a memory and tomorrow is a gift so live for the day!<br>  Like I said if you have a std then that is sooooo different he needs to know that but he does not need to know with whom or how TRUST ME on this your feelings are right it will cause problems if he insist on knowing a number then lie and don't go over 10 even make him #10 so he does not think you went over 2 hands(counting wise) this is a rule to stick by<br>  now this is my opinion from my experience all men are different but in my experience I have always regret being to open about this with my husband and I just dont do it anymore I talk with my girlfriend about these kind of things remember that it is ok to have secrets we all have them but if this really bothers you then find someone you can trust that wont judge you to get it out and move on|`|918rw51waa	Hell no, as long as you dont continue to think of it in a negative way. Your not proud of it like you said, so use your bad experiences to create good new one's, for ex, you'll know how to please him more than you would have had you not been through your bad times in life, you will be more open and honest with him about your sexual feelings, needs and wants, (and this is a good thing).  Everyone has things they are not proud of, but i feel they are good experiences as you know what to do or not to do next time around. dont dwell on the past or it could continue.   Good luck|`|0NgLUL1Iaa	hmm...well it probably boils down to if you where really meant to be. If he cares enough about you he wouldnt care, and would only concentrate on the fact the you've changed for the better, and to a point, for him nonetheless. Im sure that at first there will be a shock phase thatll probably take him some time to get over, but in the end, if its meant to be then its just meant to be, and if its not, then thats just a risk your going to have to take.|`|Sez8gIExaa	Try to be honest but bring it up in a non-intimidating manner.  Explain that you are a different person and that it may just have been a 'phase'. If he really wants to be with you then he'll be able to work past it. Don't expect it to go extremely smoothly at first though, just chose your words wisely and practice before you explain it to him|`|kTB9PWRnaa	yeh i agree with the comment above. But if you hide your history your boy friend may never know. Tell him like a few months/weeks after you start dating, and he might take it easier = ]|`|oY1YzPMzaa	I say dont tell him. Its really not relevant unless u have an STD. So if not just let the poor guy have fun!|`|2pNHOCONaa	that's actually pretty awesome that you're not proud of what you used to do before, that it even worries you enough to ask for other people's opinion. especially that you said you have changed and do not intend to do any of it anymore.<br>  <br>  but nothing will turn any person(whatever gender) off than hearing the truth from someone else. and when someone beats you to it, it might be too late for you.<br>  <br>  as long as were truly sorry for what we did in our past, which i see that you are, and maybe even apologize to the guy you like about how you used to act, and if you could turn back the time, you would not have done any of it at all so he could see how serious you are. because no matter what we say that what is done is done? it is a part of who we were, because we chose to do it.<br>  <br>  and as soon as we actually apologize for whatever wrong things we did in the past, is the same exact moment were freed from it. or even forgiven. me and my husband just talked about our past not less than a month ago. i was extremely painful. lol. absolutely embarrassing, and disgusting and it made both of us feel insecure. we talked about it for a week. just to cover everything from our past. but we reassured each other right after every detail was revealed from our past. and it was somewhat of a healing process for us. because now we know each other too well. more than anyone in this physical world ever does. more than our own mother's :) and that just strengthens our bond. because we did not wait to have someone else tell it to him or me, we trusted each other enough that we would be able to take it. and it was for our future. where it used to be his and his ex's secret? now it's lost all sense of it being special, because he told it me! it was now our secret. and same with him. we are so much closer now. and exceedingly happy and content.<br>  <br>  if it is true that he truly cares for you, then he will stick with you, and respect you for telling him the truth. if he won't? then either he's not ready or he's just not worth it. best part is, you've proven to yourself that you Are That brave, you are that Courageous :) and you simply give yourself more reason to love yourself. <br>  <br>  so i suggest, tell him. do it for You. and Goodluck! :)<br>  <br>  i wanna quote malachi from the book hostage to the devil:<br>  In his memory Peter heard Conor’s caution: “What happened in pahst histhoree, happened. The recorrd shtands. Ferivir. Loike a shtone ‘n a feeld, opin ‘n’ maneefist. Fer awl teh see, me bhoy. Incloodin’ the Grate Panjandhr’m hissilf. No, don’t deny it. Wallow in humilitee.”<br>  <br>  happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. -Gandhi<br>  <br>  we choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them. -Khalil Gibran<br>  <br>  choose wisely stranger! and strive to be happy :) it will all be worth it in the end :)|`|rWQaXqlhaa	for me it would<br>  im an 18 yo guy whose never dated,kissed or done anything with a girl<br>  and i would want a virgin|`|zka26204aa	Your history is just that--YOUR history!!!  You should not feel obligated to tell him anything about your past.  All he needs to know is that you are faithful to him.  What you did in your past is no one's business but yours!!  Keep it that way.|`|zhq5sW4laa	to be honest yea it could but if he really cares about you then it shouldn't matter how many men you've been with. He should be about to accpet you for you and if he cant then thats his loss. Maybe at first he'll be a little set off but he will have to get over it or hes not the guy for you. tell him that that was your past and your more concerned about your future WITH HIM :)     good luck|`|AA10303012	If he genuinely likes you, your history shouldnt make much difference, especially since you have changed.  When the right time comes, be open , honest, and sincere about yourself and your feelings towards him, that should be the thing that counts most.|`|G7YBTbN7aa	Well i'm a virgin, and i'd take anything at this point in time ;)<br>  do me<br>  <><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305005025AAB4IBt>" rel="nofollow">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|29789e33ca83bc63e9460a26d1b4e607aa	i think it could...you should just be honest with him about your past...and either he will except it or not. you know.
K7N0pkU8aa	I'm shy too (but only when FIRST getting to know a guy) I would text her- say something that really puts no pressure on her- like "hey me and a few friends are going to grab lunch if you want to join" ...tell her where and maybe she'll come by- and if she doesnt text her again after finals and ask her out-- also if you know who her friends are and you start hanging out in groups it'll be easier to get know her..<br>  There;s also a possibility that she is not at all interested and is just being nice by making small to with you-- just keep that in mind and don't feel rejected!|`|rWQaXqlhaa	amazing<br>  yeah i tried talking to some random girl on the bus and everyone stared and someone said i was a weirdo<br>  yeah im in college too but no hot girls here really<br>  yeah call her sometime who knows whatll happen<br>  she might flake but hopefully she wont you can only hope|`|V8RbOq82aa	No need to hurry it up. Go sloooowww. Let it sink in with the girl that you are interested but do not chase and bug her - she will think you are a creep. Let 9 days pass, give her a call to say you are still alive. Make it short. When you are in the next semester, talk to her, follow up on your offer. If she says no then maybe she is not really that into you. Move on. BTW, if you can, you should try asking several girls in parallel. Hedging, you do not want to put all your eggs in one basket right? Also, if the girl is even a little bit interested in you, seeing that other girls are interested in you will only increase her interest. Women are crazy that way... Good luck.
HkDUxkS4aa	I would never cheat on my husband!!!<br>  <br>  Sex actually means something to me... yea hard to believe nowadays..It's not something I think should be done for the fun of it.. Unless its with your husband/wife.<br>  <br>  If my husband isnt in the mood to have sex we do other things...but then it almost always leads to sex....<br>  <br>  I would just take some pics of ur wife and go into the bathroom...<br>  <br>  If you cheat you could be adding to many more problems =no sex ever again...<br>  <br>  Try talking to ur partner about this, they could change their mind. <br>  <br>  Also depending on your ages, there COULD be a medical reason for no sex drive. Maybe also something has been bothering her...How does she feel about her body? ETC ETC ETC <br>  <br>  There could be so many thing making her not want to have sex... have a talk and ask her about it.|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, I would never ever be unfaithful.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Hell no..

pKzH1cFHaa	Every adopted child is different. I have two cousins that are adopted. One never wants to know his birth parents, and the other found his birth mom on his birthday. She had a good reason to give him up. She is a part of his and his family's life and when my great aunt was alive, they were friends and even went out for lunches. So like I said, every adopted child is different.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	My best friend is adopted and she met her biological mother at age 19 and actually went to live with the bio mother and brothers and sisters and she said it was HORIBLE the house was nasty the bio mom was mean. She said she was really happy to have the opportunity to live both worlds and she feels even luckier to have been adopted by someone that loved her so much and gave her a great life.|`|Kec5I1Olaa	I was adopted 13 years ago- and I love my adopted parents alot- they really love me- but i still desire to know my birth family- im very angry with my birth mom for not changing 13 yrs later and i think that being adopted saved me- if not i could have been pregnant at 13 yrs and into drugs. Im 20 yrs old and just had my first sip of alcohol this past weekend.lol. I have never done drugs- I did have a daughter- i don't regret it- but her father is the first man i have ever been with. I really appreciate all the love and teachings that my adopted parents gave me. As far as my birth family is concerned- they could have tried harder to keep my sister and i together with them- but then again God has things happen for a reason:)|`|25l10HL8aa	I am not adopted but it would certinly change your life i MEAN HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR PARENTS GAVE YOU UP.

Most women that are a bit over weight are because they don't have time to take care of themselves because they are too busy looking after the kids and the husband.

26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	Has a  lot to do with your nationality. If you are in the US, it seems that a man has to pay alimony which must, surely, mean that he will want to avoid divorce. If on the other hand you are British, then either party can apply for a divorce, and  there is no guilty party to be penalised. Only if there are children involved, will there be a claim for ongoing maintenance. <br>  <br>  Of course, it presupposes that you actually want a divorce, or still love your husband and he is willing (as it appears) to accept the situation. Naturally you are feeling guilty, after all, your conduct is destroying your marriage.<br>  <br>  This question highlights the fact that Yahoo Answers does not distinguish between US, and UK/Ireland questions. I opt only to see UK/Ireland questions as I do not feel entirely competent to answer those from the US, but it is not always possible to see where the questioner is located, and consequently, it is very easy to give precisely the wrong answer! Yahoo really have to sort out this problem if Answers is to have any level of integrity.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	He is smart.

He divorced me and is still with this woman.  Looking back, I realize that I was in complete denial. It doesn't matter if your husband refuses to divorce you, if you want it, it will happen. People cheat for all sorts of reasons. Some work through it and others end their relationship. You need to be 100% committed in salvaging your marriage. Don't stay out of guilt. If you do stay you will ned to cut all ties with your boss. Start looking for another job. Your husband will have trust issues as it is. You need to do whatever it takes to help him through it! I'm not going to judge you but it takes a weak person to cheat. It takes a stronger person to stay and fight!

The bad thing is YOU slept with your boss and the only way for him to know if YOU mean it and you want to be with him is to get a NEW job<br>  <br>  DONT DO IT AGAIN!!!|`|n4Z00Egoaa	hmm i think you should divorce him coz you want to. <br>  <br>  trust me, might hurt him at first, but he will definately thank you later, when he finds someone worthy of his devotion|`|hqtOKXThaa	Wow you sound like a real looser
FkOnGizTaa	The romantic in me insists that you pursue him, if he is the one you love.  If you make it clear to him that you're willing/able to fulfill his needs in your relationship (with the time you now have available to spend with him), then it becomes his decision as to who is most important to him, you or the other girl.  You would not be forcing him to abandon her or anything.  So don't just give up on someone whom you feel is very special to you!  I don't believe in having only one chance; you have as many as you make for yourself.<br>  <br>  That said, what concerns me is the part about him being willing to cheat on his new girlfriend with you.  I assume that's not the kind of relationship you're hoping for.  You should be careful if you have any reason to believe that you won't be the only one in his eyes.  Conversely, for his sake, you should be careful if you have any reason to believe that he won't be the only one in your eyes, or if you believe you will fail to meet his needs for commitment again.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'd suggest telling him how you feel.  Let him know that you're willing to devote more time to him (as long as that truly is the case).  Make sure he knows that you won't go out with him if he's with someone else (as long as that is, in fact, the way you feel).  Ask if he's willing to give it another shot.  Don't demand anything.  His response should tell you what you need to know to take the next step(s).|`|aYVVwjBXaa	it sounds to me like this guy has been in love with you for four years but you just can't give him the commitment that he wants so he found someone else, possibly to make you jealous. it also sounds like you don't really love him and just want him back now that you don't have him. i mean WHO "unofficially" goes out with someone for four years? four years and you still don't want him to be your boyfriend? i don't mean to be harsh but if you put your school, famliy, job and friends so far ahead of him on the priorites list that you don't see him for a whole month it doesn't sound like you are that into him.<br>  <br>  please do this boy a favour and leave him alone. you had your chance for four whole years, don't keep dragging him along because you are lonely and jealous.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	I was gonna say tell him and be with him but after re-reading it, I totally agree with cheesebrandy's comment above me! U were a real witch with a cap B! Leave this guy alone and let him be happy!
695QqLK6aa	Well, they are very different. And it depends, I wouldn't buy a drink for my girlfriends and not the boys, but on the other hand, I wouldn't give my girlfriends a slap on the back and playfight with them. So yes and no.|`|0PsnnVb6aa	they r different in many ways...but they shud not be treated that way for sure....though some things shud be considered differently seeing if it is a man or a woman...but overall no diff shud be seen...|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	God made them different then who are we to say both are same. Everybody treat them differently all over the world.|`|lTlwrqJDaa	Yes they r different pyshycally and mentally.<br>   but  we cant treat them differently as they r equal in all.|`|5EFJlIJSaa	well for one thing.<br>  Yes, they are different.<br>  But that does not mean that you should treat them differently!
afkygHMgaa	Do you find it interesting and even a reflection of the kind of person you are that you don't even mention his wife in this scenario? Maybe you should "get it out and go over and kiss him"? What you need to get out, is of ANY relationship until you can have some compassion for others and know what true love is. Admiring him is fine, but your consideration of acting on this fantasy is ridiculous and nothing but the ensurance of pain for everyone.|`|c2rTAk71aa	haha don't worry  girlie you are just having a crush. A crush is like being drunk you just can't make sense of nothing, even though you are sober. <br>  <br>  I have this happen to me every so often and trust me it will go away. He just probably really touched your heart and that got your mind going. <br>  <br>  When i first started worked at the doctor's office I do now I had a major crush on one of the Dr's and he's married. I was fantasizing about him in bed and etc. <br>  <br>  Same thing with a guy  friend of mine. I would fantasize about us having a passionate love affair and just getting together. Not just sexual but I like wanted to hang out with him too! <br>  <br>  You just gotta let it run it's course but in the mean time don't do anything stupid like act on your "crush feelings" he has a family and wife and you don't want to be a home wrecker. <br>  <br>  trust me eventually it will go away and you will laugh at the fact that you were even feeling that way. The two times it happened to me I had the end result. like OMG thank god nothing ever happened there! <br>  <br>  I have been with my bf for 4 years and don't plan on cheating on him! We get along great and love eachother very much. <br>  <br>  Just don't tell your fiance or your fiance's brother about it because then it will just make everything so awkward and you will regret opening your big mouth once those feelings go away.|`|8AGnSPg7aa	i think you were just touched by his generosity. please dont give a chance to your fantasies. those are just physical and may gone one day. if you do something about it or do what is in your head, its diffecult to bring back good thngs when you've done a silly mistake. just do your fantasies with your fiance.lol|`|PAJLZCcAaa	DONT DO ANYTHING WITH THE BROTHER! this will only ruin everything!! you should just think about it in a different way, i think that you are thinking these things because he is so caring towards you, you shouldnt worry too much about it, it will probably just pass out of your head soon. its nothing to worry about! :)<br>  <br>  <(*_*)>|`|cgLvMqmOaa	Well I honestly don't think you should just "get it out" that would be awkward and would nine times out of ten end badly. no horribly.<br>  Everywoman has urges like that its natural that will pass and you'll have new ones. I think you just have to give it some time and try not to make it too obvious.|`|v8XK80Ycaa	YOUR URGES MAY BE STRONG BUT I WOULD JUST KEEP THEM AS FANTASISES, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN THAT, THEY ARE YOUR OWN SECRETS. Dont put everything in jeopardy. if you make a move on him, whats to say that he doesnt accept your advances and tell his brother?<br>  be careful, stay safe|`|WT1OxqMWaa	Forget it. If we all responded to the people we find attractive this would be a real screwed up world. Keep your feelings to yourself if you truly treasure your fiance.
zUdxoRbyaa	i was lucky enough to be adopted by wonderful parents. i never had the urge to seek my real mother, however i hold no grudge with her. it probably would have been easier for her to abort me, she didn't. for that i will always love her.|`|cj29AORfaa	I don't know. When I was younger,I wished it. But now I actually have a reason to live.|`|nrme3EQuaa	When I was 12 my mother looked into it.  But the doctor thought ending my life so far on would be murder!<br>  ..  Crazy old pro-lifers  lol
LlRAOMq8aa	I am sorry if dont support Gay and to be honest i dont believe one can wake up and say i am gay,<br>  God was not stupis creating a man and a female and to your information gay things ane Les started in satanic gatherings so this is the devil using,can you be real you and stop letting  the devil controling and confusing you.<br>  And being gay how do u knwo ur famale or male as in its devalish and i swear God new Anus has its work en not for sex and i pity the stupid men it must be Damm painfull.<br>  <br>  If you knwo how to pray u should en stop allthis<br>  I said sorry first may be u wont like it but thats how i feel about this<br>  <br>  So sop all this confusion|`|zUdxoRbyaa	do what makes you happy.|`|KCpGsN2faa	I am straight but I wholeheartedly respect and support gays. It really sucks that you are going through this. People can be so fearful of something they don't understand or consider evil. I wish you the best of luck on coming out, remember that even if your family and your friends abandon you, there are way more open minded people out in the world who will happily accept you as is.|`|vDCmFP06aa	Hi, you kind of have to put your self in every loved ones position! I am not saying it's right or wrong... it's just that you can not blame anyone for the way you feel or the way they feel it's just the way it is!<br>  <br>  If and when you come out with it, just give everyone some time and with time things will work themselves out!<br>  <br>  There is no need to feel suicidal... after all life is not meant to be perfect, just build some strength within and do what you feel is right and what makes you happy!<br>  <br>  For true happiness, look within yourself. It's difficult to be happy if you rely on outside resources.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!
SoLSd9Lyaa	Yeah. Believe it or not, I've been in that situation before. (but I had my own room LOL)<br>  <br>  Anyway, when I was in my early days in high school, a lot bullied me, people around me didn't seem to care or even to understand. I didn't know why, until now. But I guess, what made me feel better is when I get to tell myself that "This is my life." <br>  Believe me, if you accept it, I think you'd get used to it and then you'll just notice that you're not crying over things anymore.|`|WHnqoYBkaa	its your period. or chronic depression.
j0mI8l07aa	Your "best friend" sounds like a self-absorbed @#%&!<br>  Why do you even like her?<br>  Tell her to get over herself, she doesn't control your life. She's just mad that you can be interesting to her friends without being rich and preppy. Something she could probably NEVER do.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	Hey, I'm from Fresno too, did you mean Fresno, CA?<br>  It sounds like your friend is not really a friend to treat you that way. I wouldn't stay around her if she belittles you that way.Maybe she doesn't want you selling weed to her friends? I don't mean to preach, but you are so young, it would be a shame for you to mess up your life getting busted selling that stuff. A record can really affect your future.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	She's not a real friend. She's a user, I should say. <br>  Dump her. That's it. Period.<br>  She's not even worth it.|`|MXOEHcXRaa	Tell her face to face, "You know, She also my friend. She;s not just yours. If you're gonna talk me to me like that i'm not gonna be your friend anymore and i'll always hang out with "your" friends."<br>  <br>  It should work. good luck.|`|9BA1DBMBaa	sounds like she is not a true friend to me get a new one and forget about her she will find out she will miss you and come crying back.|`|xufESx85aa	Your friend is acting like a retard. You should be able to hang out with whoever you want, whether she likes it or not.|`|d6856eef3474a6c8179274b1e011a0a5aa	lol i didnt think popular thing sitll around, in my school theres not much of pop kids and dork kids, well there are nerds, but they are smart and can be fun to hang out with. i would whack that friend of yours. um selling weed? thats a sarcasm right? <br>  <br>  she just doesnt wnat you to take her popularity away she wants to be on top, she obviously wants attension to her only, she does not want to share it with someone equally.
fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	um, I don't know what girls you fool with but no woman in their right might "likes" tight "braz" sometimes it isn't about what you think, women do things to please themselves first and guys second. a nice pair of heels a short skirt...yeah gets your attention but it got hers first. so in turn she will feel better when you can't keep your eyes in your head cause it confirms the fact she knew when she bought those things.|`|momw588Waa	ur a very narrow minded, big headed snobb and i sugest u go to hell..........i also happen to think u jst want attention with this question, no person in their ryt mind would right something like this unless they have no respect for women at. i realy hope u get grip of urself|`|AA12316366	they are just two bit sluts that have nothing else to offer and this is the only way to get attention|`|veeC7Rvvaa	What do you mean by tight bra's? It can be very difficult to know what size your breasts are and a lot of women wear the wrong type and size, and they don't do it on purpose. <br>  I hope you're a 13 years old kid, because i'm so sick of immature old men.
j0mI8l07aa	Talk to him! You have nothing to lose!<br>  Most guys absolutely LOVE it (I know I do) when girls approach us instead of us having to approach them. It makes us feel like a million bucks.<br>  Best case scenario: You two hit it off and romance blooms.<br>  Worst case scenario: He gets flattered and you ease your curiosity.<br>  And don't overly worry before hand or plan out a script of what you are going to say or anything, that always comes out awkward. Just DO IT!|`|3w7ekDQJaa	your question is REALLY long but i got the jist of it- try being subtle and ask him for some help with training etc. good luck and have fun!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	It's really non of your business you're not his mom!|`|urdCLZVwaa	just start flirting with him<br>  <br>  and then he will make a discussion if he wants you or not|`|EWUt6v59aa	ok i go to the gym 2 i go to 24 hr fitness n yeah that happen to me last time this girl fell in love with me without knowin her so one time that i was lifting weights she got close to me n trying to lift some weight then she started talking to me about sports n what days do i go to d gym n some other question n so thats how our conversation started so yeah i think you should do the same thing u know|`|s2T20ikDaa	dont feel just trust ur instinct. im sure he'll talk back to you.If he does'nt that means he is a jerk. you are beautiful and u are only 16 so cute guyes will come around

She's awesome. :-)|`|c2rTAk71aa	Not perfect but the best mother she could be. <br>  <br>  Been through hell and back but never resorted to drugs or alcohol to heal. <br>  <br>  Forgetful and stubborn but she has a great big heart.<br>  <br>  nice and not judgemental. <br>  <br>  Funny and sensitive. <br>  <br>  I love my mother so much.|`|cj29AORfaa	Neglectful.

v7XLArZraa	If only I knew James Meadows hunny, if only i knew.
4drQ38qZaa	Oh holding hands is great! But if you start out slow you get this weird cramp feeling and then you get scared. But you get used to it. <br>  <br>  When I first held hands it was so weird. It went like this:<br>  The night before (December 5,2008) I was looking up tons of things about holding hands. I wanted to know it all! And also I did not want to make the move to hold his hand because of the two kisses I gave him and I never received my first kiss. But anyways the kissing thing is soon. Okay so my boyfriend and I wanted to see Twilight together and we made it happen! We also went with my sister Karen and bff Taylor. When the movie started I tried my best to make my hand seem to want to be held. I stuck my finger off my chair and under the cup holder and put it on my bf’s seat. I think after ten to twenty minutes he got the idea or at least did not know and ended up touching my finger. At that moment my hand, body, and emotions shock up. I was in heaven and embarrassment. But even so I did not want him to untouch my finger. Soon he hand to go use the bathroom and when he came back I did the same finger trick. When I reached his finger I tried to get it for he would know what to do.  And guess what? He did do it! It was so fast. I think he just grabbed my hand and held it during the whole movie! I was kind of scared because my hands sweat and are cold a lot. But I don’t think he cared. I just went with it. But soon when he was still holding it but it seemed to be getting looser but then my friend Taylor and Karen asked me something during the movie and just slid my hand into his again. He was so nice and rubbed it with his thumb. Though when the movie ended I felt dazed and dizzy. <br>  <br>  After everything I so wanted to kiss my boyfriend but my sister came out and I could not! She would be mad and tell mom for SURE!! So I did not. I hoped he was going to kiss me. After we dropped my bff off at her house we went to my boyfriend’s house and I had not dreamt of this but he leaned over and kissed me on the chin (right side) and said bye. What a night to remember. I wish this could always happen. YAY!|`|kIblsxJQaa	warm and safe.|`|AA11441704	I guess it feels great......|`|fESoEbgzaa	its 2nd greatest feeling in the world. you just feel so happy, and like you can achieve anything because you have this person, its weird, but when it happens youll agree.<br>  <br>  the #1 best feeling in the world is when u have sex with the person you love. its the same feelign as the one above but times it by 100|`|940aeb175b0facf00b53d83108c83e62aa	I haven't experienced it either<br>  but I am sure, whenever it will happen, it is so cute and cool feeling.|`|1gFxxJsBaa	Goosebump|`|jpiVHAN5aa	quite fantastic, you cant describe it, well it the same feeling as kissing, like a rush of adrenaline, speaking of which i just had one... random. sometimes talking about adrenaline rushes a bit through, well it does for me|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	Me, too. Unfortunately, I've never had experience that moment. But I think I'd be feeling awkward and weird when that happened. I'd be soaring above the skies when that happened.|`|WHnqoYBkaa	It feels good.....for a few minutes.<br>  And then he either:<br>  Moves his hands lower (perv) <br>  OR says something stupid.|`|MXOEHcXRaa	It feels amazing knowing that someones there|`|ZHNnDu1Faa	It's undescrible you have to experience it in order to know it. :)|`|s3gs4JLAaa	well, you'll feel like everything is alright and will be alright forever
xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, honey please trust me, caring about someone or loving someone has nothing to do with having power over the other one. In fact, really it is just the opposite. <br>  <br>  It could be lots of reasons why she does not get a hold of you first, or for her not asking you to come over. She could be shy. She could just maybe not really think about it. She could still be hooked on her old boyfriend. And sometimes people just love to have drama in their life and she might be doing it so that it will keep you wondering and guessing. She might know that you care so much and so she has nothing to worry about. If I were you, I would back off and cool it for a while. See if she thinks about getting a hold of you if you don't her. Now I know this will be hard for you, as you are going to want to talk to her or be around her. The thing is honey, that if you don't, it will tell you plenty about you and her. After a while if she don't get a hold of you then you know how she really feels. That might hurt you, but it is better to know for sure, they not to know. Then on the other hand, if she does get a hold of you, then it will prove that she missed talking to you. <br>  <br>  All I am saying is, you just might be making this too easy for her to act the way she is. Yes, we should not have to play these little "drama" games, but I have a feeling she just might be doing just that. Time will tell, but only if you follow through with it. Good Luck to you.  Aunt DeeDee.
X2Ks0tfHaa	Why you stressing? Just go to her house and see what happens|`|ZGHl5FITaa	By asking "...if you want to" I would assume that she is just saying that because she cares about you. She is just saying it because she probably wants you to come, but if you're too busy she'll understand. I also think that she does JUST really want to play pool, but who knows, maybe it can turn out into a memorable night! Good luck!|`|AA12253092	GEEEEeeeeee ......  just go and play pool or watch tv - if it's right you'll both connect without pressure.    Take it slow.......|`|gELcwzNhaa	just go for it <br>  you have nothing to lose<br>  make sure you flirt with her heaps..or else itll be awkward|`|zY3ixLW6aa	just go to her house, and see what happens, but dont push it|`|NVuvP8kIaa	Just go over and play pool or whatever she wants you to. Maybe she is shy and blew you off at the movies and now wants to hang out with you and get to know you better. I would not make out with her b/c if she went or it before you're dating, then your friends may be right she could possibly be a ****. Just remember don't date someone just b/c they are hot, there's more to everyone than just their outward appearances. If you want to date her make sure it is because you have a connection :)
1YdeUn1Caa	Find a girl that does know you. This sounds like a classic stalker tale.|`|5pujYL3Yaa	i think you need to explore your feelings better.  she doesn't know you but you love her?  sounds like infatuation or a crush,,,, not love
dJoE8yedaa	Firstly, what in your relationship would give her reason to cheat? Where were the kids when this happened? Did she admit to cheating or is it all in your thoughts? It's rare for women to cheat. If she hasn't admitted anything, don't jump to conclusions. Take your time, make notes and take one step at a time. eg Do the paternity tests if you're worried that your kids may not be yours. You can now do paternity tests through the womb so do that if necessary. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, don't jump to conclusions. There may be reasonable explanations for everything.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I would get blood tests on the kids to make sure they are yours.<br>  I would fight for the kids and get a hold of some of your family for help.<br>  I will say a prayer for you. I feel very sad that you have to go through this.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	You are not stuck with two kids, you are blessed with two kids.  Get your priorities straight.

If you apply a calamine lotion to it, and it doesn't disappear within 2 days, then it is a hickey.  There is no advice I can give you on dealing with your son, that is something that you have to deal with yourself as I am sure you know.

8nCjdRK6aa	It seems like he is jealous and thinks your going to get back with your ex bf just because you talked to him, some guys are like that. Leave it for a few days without talking to him and see if he starts talking to you again and explain that you were just talking to him so why do you seam jealous of him or something along those lines then if that doesn't work then he ain't worth it if he is just not going to talk to you just because you were talking to your ex.|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	What should you do.<br>  <br>  Well, personally, I'd thank my lucky stars the new guy screwed up and showed you his personality BEFORE you guys progressed very far into the relationship.<br>  <br>  Throwing a hissy-fit over you talking to your ex?

Weird, because he's sure acting like he is.<br>  <br>  Behavior like this does not magically go away because you like him.  Nor will it change simply because you marry him.   Its pretty much there for life.   And if you think his little childish tantrums will fade away in time if you "show him enough love", then you'd be dead wrong.<br>  <br>  Of course, since you "love" him, I highly doubt you'll be listening to any "run for your life" advise.<br>  <br>  So,  instead, .... I'll be getting ready to hear from you again in a few months.<br>  <br>  "My bf doesn't let me talk to my friends and he's constantly checking up on me because he doesn't trust me.  What should I do???"<br>  <br>  Hell,  I'll answer that question HERE so you won't have to bother posting it.<br>  <br>  RUN FOR YOUR LIFE !!!<br>  <br>  Sheesh.   I really hope you start listening to common sense SOMEWHERE along the line.
NVuvP8kIaa	It is worth the wait. I did not end up waiting for the right person and I regret it. Make sure whoever you're going to end up losing it to cares for you, because you're never going to forget your first time and would you rather remember just doing it because you felt you needed to or having a special time with a girl you loved and who loved you? Sex is very emotionally make sure to make smart decisions :)|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	no it's not worth it.|`|anfhcnWeaa	i don't see any bonus that could magically appear if you wait it's not like sleeping with the right woman for you is going to get you Billion dollars(unless it's in some long lost relatives Will) so basically i say enjoy life to the fullest and have fun in bed with whoever you feel like it.<br>  <br>  (personally i was given a challenge a few years back by some friends, <br>  the challenge was more of requirement that if i wanted to get married i have to sleep with at least 10 different women of course to sweeten the deal the offer me 500 bucks if i did it and got married within 10years.)|`|Q13UIQGyaa	if you are both ready and you want to have sex then go for it. otherwise you'll be waiting forever. what makes her the right gal? she might be a boy! so loosen up|`|3lKAR9G2aa	I had a 1 night stand simply because the guys were giving me crap about being a virgin.  Then I met  and married my wife.  I kinda wish I had waited for her.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sex is sex... doesn't matter who you do it with or when... as long as you enjoy it and are protected... :D
TShsb3EXaa	Stop being paranoid. <br>  <br>  Firstly, liking someone is not the same as loving them. What she saw in that guy was a 'crush' and what she has seen with you would be 'love' or a much deeper crush.<br>  <br>  So, she liked the guy but never actually tried anything with him. So she never cheated on you. <br>  <br>  So she looked at the guy and must of said 'No, I like my bf enough to avoid this' or something like that. <br>  <br>  Seeing as you have said that you have been together for almost 5 months and been through a lot, that scenario seems believable to me.<br>  <br>  So then there is no reason not to carry on your relationship.|`|AA11441704	That would be a bold move.
1qTNn8qnaa	This happened to me...the other way around though....i told mum about dad cos i thought she deserved better than that....she shouldn't be cheated on and then also have me her daughter keeping life changing secrets from her...<br>  I was in year 12 when they finally separated...but i owed it to my mum to tell her the truth...it really depends on if ur close to ur dad or not....If u think he works hard for you guys and he deserves the truth....out of respect for him tell him...OR talk to ur mum about it...and make her be honest to him...<br>  but u gota have a conscience of steel to keep a secret like that from a loved one....believe me i know!...So its better to sort it out with ur mum and if she does nothing then ur dad deserves to know...<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|EQdDkSw0aa	You want to seperate your parent's...dude com'n now! Talk to your mum and tell her that she has to stop cheating on your father. Make her tell him what she is doing hehind his back. You need to stay away from this problem and focus on getting your degree.<br>  <br>  I'ts best to come from your mum not you :-)|`|AA10776535	You do not tell your dad...Let your mom know you know tho.|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	it is not your business to tell your father anything. you should talk to your mom about it though, tell her to stop and think about what she is doing to her family, maybe she will listen to you.|`|AA12253092	Don't underestimate your father - he may already know - and perhaps doesn't want to deal with it till your out of school.<br>  <br>  Don't tell.  I'm sorry, how sad.|`|AA11198190	Do not feel guilty.<br>  They may be your parents.....But keep out of this one.|`|36afb47e932fcc253f891fd79c630e80aa	You don't.  It's not your place to say.  It's up to your father to find out on his own.  Never interferr with adult relationships because it could back fire onto you.  Your the child and you don't need to be blamed for something you have no control over.  It's just best to pretend you don't know.  If she gets caught then too bad for her but don't say you knew about it either.  You don't want the anger of betrayal being displaced onto you.  Cheaters don't care who it hurts because if they care they wouldn't have done it.  There really is no excuse out there to justify cheating.  But because you the child in this situation you need to keep yourself safe your father may go crazy or he may just walk away.  These days its best as a child to protect yourself.  Besides adults are responsible for their own actions.  She's a grown woman and if that is what she chooses to do then she would have to face the consquiences if she ever gets caught.  Don't worry yourself over it.  Your a child and you should be living your life enjoying your youth, school, friends and etc.  Don't worry about the adult drama.|`|r2Yo7YRNaa	If I were you confront your mum and tell her that you lost respect for her because of what she is doing if she stops then don't tell if she doesn't then she leaves you no choice. I have been in the same situation where my dad cheated on my mum and after having an argument with my dad about it to the point that he almost punch me in the face, he realised what kind of an irresponsible and unloving monster he had become and so he finished his relationship with the low grade woman right away.|`|zRkTwsawaa	My dear, your mind is too young and you are too young as well to let such a complicated issue rise up from you and besides, it is between your parents. Think of what will be your condition when it springs up. How will you feel?. Who are you protecting?. You never want any man to take advantage of your mother but remember, if you ever let the cat out of the cage, you are bound to get your parents separated.<br>  <br>  REMAIN SILENT!|`|Xy1XH5gVaa	You should talk to your Mother first, and tell her that you know whats going on and if she doesn't end the affair immediately you will have no choice but to speak to your Father. Hopefully this will snap her out of it. Good luck!|`|5pujYL3Yaa	sooner the better dude.  then you can start sleeping at night too.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	Dont talk to your mum about it and tell her if she doesent stop u will tell to ur dad|`|AA11230809	uh...dont tell your dad let him find out on his own|`|LX0EOsCHaa	tell your mommy to stop being a whore and fix her marrage
d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	?    You are what you are not what others call you.|`|zka26204aa	Quit feeling sorry for yourself and start praying for strength.  Stand up to his mother and tell her that you do not appreciate her speaking to you with disrespect, and if she can't speak to you will respect, you will refused to carry on a conversation with her.  Leave your marriage if you are not happy, visit your son's grave and be glad he is in a better place. Talk to your mother and your older son, and resolve your differences no matter what it takes.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	You've taken a lot and are now suffering the consequences so are quite naturally depressed.  First thing you should go to your doctor and let him prescribe something for your depression.  Don't try to do anything else at the moment.  Just get yourself sorted out.  When the antidepressants kick in, you will start feeling normal again and a lot of this stuff isn't going to weigh you down as much as it is at the moment.  THEN you can start doing something about getting your life back on track and standing up to the bullying mother in law.|`|KTdJPMpSaa	You are depressed but I don't think antidepressants will help you, as its your life situation that's making you ill.  You need to ask yourself Do I want to continue putting up with this is my marriage worth it? Or ask yourself if its time to go, either situation is very difficult for you to stay means you have to accept the problems and find a away to work through your emotions and basically toughen up so these things don't bother - un less your husband is very sympathetic and helps you sort things out!!  The other option is to to leave and start again on your own which is also very difficult to do especially after so many years of marriage.  Try to arrange to see a counsellor you can talk in private and the doctor can arrange free sessions for you unless you can afford to pay.  maybe speaking your mind and getting things out in the open will help you make a decision. x|`|Vy3QlUA9aa	You are going through so many S**t at the same time.  I know grief  by itself can depress u.  Added to that a mean mother-inlaw can mae your life hell.  So, your crying is normal.  It is a grieving process.  In fact it is healthy because you are not suppressing your grief inside.<br>  <br>  Remember not to make a habit of crying though.  The key here is to remember S**t like this happen to a lot of ppl all the time, and the only thing you have control over is the way you respond to it.  So Look up, don't let this destroy your hope.  Pray to your God and the spirit of the Lord-almighty will comfort you.<br>  Amen
baNZhUb2aa	Its an ego thing.. We stare at each other to see who will back off first. Its fight or flight.. What's even better than the other guy turning away first is that he trips and fall or bangs into someone/something.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	cause they're not really straight.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I think its kind of a "stare off", a power thing to try and intimidate the other guy and prove his masculinity.|`|UWj7XorXaa	well what do girls think when saring at another girl well in my head im like look at her  _____________ insert what ever here lol   and then i crak up laughing i guese its the same but probably not hahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahah...|`|VwKoHJGqaa	im pretty sure straight guys dont stare at other guys.<br>  <br>  some might, but that doesnt mean that they like the guy|`|8AAiZGNHaa	they're probably checking out their swag and comparing it with theirs<br>  <br>  Lol|`|YA3JJwE3aa	They're having a staring contest.|`|AA11416725	i do it too and iam st8,i just like to see just what kind of shoes and clothes he has on and how he walks and his hair color,its just a guy thing|`|s3gs4JLAaa	maybe cuz those guys they were looking in were a very good guys so they wanted to be the same or maybe the opposite|`|ITEs4BY5aa	maybe because there gay :O

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, you sure do sound like a nice guy.<br>  <br>  With living so far apart, the best thing to do is write her long letters. In letters sometimes we can express ourselves better too. Also, it will give her something that she can go back and read over and over again, and will always be able to keep. Maybe cut cute things you read about out of magazines, or jokes that you can send her. Take pictures or send postcards so she can learn about you, your country and your life. It is the best way for people to get to know about each other that live so far away from each other.<br>  <br>  In time you both will know if anything more then friendship will come from this. Then for you to send her cute little items, you will better know her, and her likes and dislikes. Maybe a favorite book you have enjoyed, or a teddy bear that is cute. Like I said in time you will learn what she enjoys.  If you don't end up dating, you could have a friendship that might last a lifetime.  Good Luck and start writing!!! Ha. Aunt DeeDee.
ECLU693qaa	I don't think he thinks you are a joke or he would not be with you. However, you should really think twice about being in a relationship with someone with whom you have 'to tred on thin glass' I know you have liked him for a long time but he is probably not the person you imagined he would be, and you cannot make him that person. You should be able to be yourself with him by now and not worry about how he will re-act to something you say. You DESERVE better than that. Put him back on your 'nice to look at' list and move on.|`|GrddldYLaa	i wouldt bother it sound like he still likes that girl dont waste your time hope this help|`|AA10874030	It doesn't sounds like you're a big joke. it just sounds like you're in the early stages of the relationship and finding out things about each other. Its good that he's being honest and opening up to you about his past even though some of the things he said can't have been easy to hear. Everyone has got baggage and maybe because you've liked this guy for so long you've put him on a bit of a pedestal. I think you should peruse the relationship but go steady and don't rush anything or throw yourself into the relationship, don't do all the pursuing - you could get hurt. You've liked him for 3 years so you must bee quite strongly for him but it doesn't mean he's going to feel this same.|`|wLwtUzqKaa	if he's still obsessing over a girl from school den u n so do not need him coz hw long has it been n he hasn't even forgotten her|`|x2lq4R3aaa	You're probably not a big joke to him, as jokes themselves elicit at least a cursorary response. Like a "heh" or even a quick nod. You are none of these things.|`|32d808376cd2ba67d02e1e31adfd3d09aa	i think he is not suit you i was y i would left him with silence <br>  then i'll see if he care or not|`|qiHNnZh7aa	tell him about your feelings dont keep thinking other wise he will go out with someone else|`|f8ON3dRfaa	I think he's trying to figure out who he is, what he wants, and what he needs. Problem is, while he's still figuring it out, you're caught in this web of confusion. He's confused, you're confused by him.<br>  <br>  I know it may not be easy since you admitted you've liked him for 3 years (that's long!), but good to give him some space, don't get too close, let him settle down his life, his thoughts, his emotions. Most of the time, he doesn't know what to do with you in his life! He may have feelings for you, but then what?<br>  <br>  I feel that he's incapable to cater to your emotional needs at this point of time and it's very tedious and stressful to continue in such a relationship. Giving each other a cool-down period, more for him to figure himself out, and then approach the relationship together, with a clearer mind would be my suggestion. But I do agree, how easy can letting go be?

At worst maybe he was checking up on you to see if you were still committed to saving sex for marriage and if you weren't trying for that anymore he would have his way with you.  I think when he picked you up and spent time with you at the movies he realized you were still of the same mindset and that he wasn't getting any so he took you home as soon as he could.  I don't know but I would be cautious.  Looks like he's just keeping you on the side.

K1UicE7kaa	Spending time at school will put you in random contact with eligible guys that have some maturity and intellect (hopefully). When possible... do your schoolwork at school in the library etc.. [Two birds with one stone theory.]  People are not generally turned off by someone that has a child.  But... you have to talk in the present and can not focus on the ex at all.  If they sense he is in the picture they will move on.  They might ask questions to evaluate this.<br>  <br>  Sit in a traffic area but not with others.  After study... linger in a periodical area so you don't look too busy to approach.  If someone does approach and you like them... say I was just going for some coffee would you like to join me? Focus on their interests and school efforts... pointing out commonalities.  Don't go into an endless list of being overwhelmed as a single mom... show you have it together, have energy and are organized. If they are not mature and appropriate... move on.  Otherwise you are tying yourself up with another looser.  <br>  <br>  There are guys out there that are single Dads too. Responsible single parents know they do not have time or money to waste on ones that fall short.  They will and you should too... cut the relationship early if red flags are seen.  Set some criteria and stick to it... Like those with healthy lifestyles only.  Don't be afraid to explore a  quiet geek... they can be helped to grow out of that.<br>  <br>  I married a single mom and we both have degrees now and a happy life.  I was the geek.|`|XGZBEdAWaa	There are allot of guys out there who will date and get in a relationship with a girl with a kid.

Maybe try wording it in a more affective way.  Also, guys are much more inclined to do household chores if they are getting regular sex, sad but true lol<br>  <br>  Also, never call your husband names, not even jokingly, because it can be taken in the wrong way and can start word slinging.  It's really best just to avoid that pit altogether.|`|bH1DYr5saa	Because a lot of men wouldn't get much done unless someone was telling them to do it. But then a man doesn't like being told what to do so will purposely put it off because they want to do it in their own time.

They call us naggers to make us feel guilty and as a reason for then to stay sat on their behinds!|`|lIO4uiJmaa	People (both men and women) 'nag' because they have different standards or ideals about things.  For example you might 'nag' your husband to pick up his dirty socks every night, because by your standards  you find it unacceptable to have dirty  laundry on the floor, whereas by his standards a pair of dirty socks on the floor is nothing to worry about or be bothered about.  So you would be seen to be nagging !<br>  <br>  It doesn't make you a nasty minded person at all.<br>  <br>  Not sure how you can resolve it though  - either carry on nagging or try and ignore it !<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|AA11900069	I've enjoyed (NOT) this from a lady before.

Also many people cannot stomach being single again.  People are really stupid and weak.  I was like this over one girl when I was much younger.  This has not happened to me since.  I let my girlfriends know ahead of time that if they cheat they are done.  No excuses, no second chances.  And to my knowledge I have been cheated on since.  But if I am cheated on, once I find out I would choose to not speak to that person ever again.|`|C0jic2viaa	"Once a cheater, always a cheater" is an unfair and stupid generalization. It pisses me off so badly that people still brand you for life for a mistake that you will never repeat again.

And usually cheating is just that, sex.<br>  <br>  I agree, that you shouldnt stay with someone who is cheating on you because of kids, or you have no other means of supporting yourself. But if someone loves the person, they may still want to work it out. Especially if you see the, "marriage" as through thick and thin aspect.<br>  <br>  I dont think I would tolerate anyone cheating on myself, but sometimes people just want to believe that others will change, even if they wont.<br>  <br>  Love is something that cannot be underestimated. And the ones that "do" break up with people for cheating, theres usually way more problems there to begin with, and cheating was just the last straw. <br>  <br>  But for some love conqueres all, and think everyone deserves a second chance. And if someone can find it in their heart to forgive someone who hurt them so much.

You have told us what she earns, where she lives and what she does for a living, but what kind of person is she? Would you say she is happy with her life? I believe that is the true definition of success. Being happy within yourself and your own accomplishments.<br>  Everyone is different in measuring success. Materialistic people base it on how much they make, where they live, what they drive and what designer label stuff they have etc. Where as other people find comfort in family, children, friends, the simple things. At the end of the day, if you couldnt see yourself being career driven, self sufficient and independant, then obviously her life is not your kind of success. But it might be hers, and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|0v55bQT1aa	I simply don't measure a successful man or woman by his/her bank account.

A successful person to me is one that lives their life and does it honestly. A peron with integrity and a good work ethic.

1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	This is start of an abuse - you give into this you will have tolerated some abusive behavior. You are no better but deserve better. Love is temporary insanity - we cannot think rationally when we are 'in love'. It's like a high that is so cool.|`|qthjey1jaa	Is he going off to college next year?  What if he goes to one far away? What happens to your relationdship then?<br>  <br>  It is obvious that the two of you are not communicating on what is really bothering him...which may be what I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I dated a 16 year old who I eventually married 2 1/2 years later...and stayed married for 23 years...so I know what it is like to be in love with and have to deal with a 16 year old girl.<br>  <br>  THere is a big difference between 16 and 18, even though it is only two chronological years. I was 18 1/2 myself. So, both you and he have a lot of maturing to do.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is stop with the name-calling. That is immature behavior at any age.<br>  <br>  The next thing you need to do is to call a truce, and tell him that the two of you need to see a relationship counselor.<br>  <br>  I know, you're thinking, "WTF?" but hear me out. It is next to impossible for the two of you to work out your communication issues -- and the deeper, underlying issues by yourselves.<br>  <br>  The next thing I can tell you is love is NOT enough to make a relationship last. I don't care how much you love him, it cannot substitute for things like communication, compatibility, common interests, and so forth.<br>  <br>  If you cannot find a counselor with whom to talk, then the two of you can talk to me online. It will have to be both of you and not just you. Just text the word "docrjp" to SAYNOW (729669) on your cellphone, and leave me a voice message.<br>  <br>  If you love him that much, then you will do what is needed here.

He asked to meet at the restaurant which was no biggy to me.  We met, had a nice dinner and conversation.  When the bill came, he paid for his meal and asked for my half of the bill.  Okay, so we went dutch.  Next, he asked if I wanted to see a movie.  Thought I'd give him <br>  a second chance so I said yes.  At the theater, he paid for himself and got himself a drink and popcorn.  I paid for my ticket and stuck around since I wanted to see the movie.  After the movie was done, he asked if I can drive him home (to Boston!!) since he said he took the bus to get Newport.

We were just driving around having a good time, then all our friends slowly started getting off for the night (by the way we were in my car) then it came down to the nitty gritty (just me and him) so hoping that we would really hook up and go from there we went and parked at the local park, but all we did was talk about his girlfriends or other stupid things!|`|ee9a0726254388eccff33aa7095aca63aa	About a year and a half ago I ran into a friend from high school at a store in my hometown. We started talking, and I thought he was a lot cooler than I remembered. I had a lot of stuff going on, so it was awhile before we were able to get together for dinner, but when we did it was an utter disaster. First of all, he weaseled his way out of picking me up, insisting that it was out of his way.  Once we got to the restaurant (or "bar" as I called it) he refused to take his hat off at the table, and when I said something about it he scoffed and told me I remind him of his mom. Then he proceeded to ignore me all through dinner and flirt with our waitress. He drank just enough to be loud and obnoxious, didn't even offer to pay for my dinner, and actually put his feet up on the table.  Then, as we were leaving (he didn’t even walk me out to my car) he shook my hand and patted my shoulder.  I’d told a mutual friend of ours that we were having dinner that night, so when she talked to him a few days later, he told her that he had a great time and we really hit it off.  At least I got a good laugh out of it.|`|5356026da17dd7fd9ec0858d2e03b877aa	I went on a date even though I was really sick, and I ended up pooping my pants... oops!|`|df813cd3de4358fea3dc19ad71cb2730aa	Yours wins by far!  I had a date with this guy once and he proceeded to walk about 2 metres ahead of me the whole night long.  Sure he had longer legs than me and could probably walk faster, but I was walking at a normal speed, and I know he did like me and wanted to see me again so it wasn't like he was embarrassed to be seen with me.  It was ridiculously annoying!|`|e2dfd7eb65d0d2120a4565407a8c2ee7aa	I think your experience takes the cake here. I wouldn't want to see that either, no matter how great he looked! It's called TMI.<br>  <br>  My worst date was when I was still in NJ, and it was a favor to a friend.<br>  <br>  Her boyfriend didn't single date until the third date (I have no clue why), so on their second date she got me to double with one of his friends. Total blind, she didn't even know the friend. <br>  So he picks me up in a beat up old pick-up, in cowboy boots that (I swear his is true) looked as if he had been kicking cowpies. The toes and heels of the boots were suspiciously brown, NJ soil is red clay! He didn't do anything that even resembled manners, he didn't hold the door for me, he didn't pay me share or ever offer to, he didn't ask my opinion for a place to eat, the two guys just decided while us girls sat there with no input, and the guys picked the music playing too loud. After dinner (at a fast food joint) we went to play pool, again the guys choice. He proceeded to think that I needed "help" to shoot, so he was bending over me trying to show me how to hold the cue, aim, and pointing out what balls I should hit. He also kept trying to order beers for me, said it would help "put me in the mood" (I was 17, and he was underage himself) He also kept calling me stupid pet names, like darlin', honey, sugar, etc...I eventually got sick of it, and "accidently" hit him in the goin with the cue stick when taking a shot. After he got back into a standing position, he ran out of the pool hall, jumped in his truck, and drove off. The three of us had to find our own way home. <br>  <br>  My friend dumped her guy the next day.|`|f7ace519ab6dff95fc3879b040e8972eaa	okay your was worse but...some guy took me to the Buffalo ranch on our first date!! with his daughter!!! how lame is that i was totally Bord,and it was gross!!

a6c8fffb09c58323cff1e1a1abf16343aa	well your question makes no sense<br>  but i think you meant what r some good kissing tips ???? (maybe?)<br>  <br>  ok<br>  <br>  Set the scene. Make sure that the mood and time are right.<br>  Relax! Take a deep breath and let go of any tension in your neck and shoulders.<br>  Put your arms around the person you want to kiss.<br>  Start off with a normal kiss, not too firm, not too aggressive. Closing your eyes is optional.<br>  In mid kiss, gently open your mouth and softly nudge the other persons mouth open using your tongue.<br>  Again, not too aggressively, move your tongue inside the other persons mouth and playfully touch their tounge.<br>  Read the other persons body language, if they seem tense or start to pull away, stop what you are doing.<br>  If they open their mouth more or otherwise indicate they like the kiss, keep on doing what you have been only with a little more passion.<br>  As the kissing gets going saliva build up can be a problem, don't forget to swallow.<br>  Make sure you keep your tongues relaxed but your lips tight (saliva again), you don't want the kiss to turn messy.<br>  <br>  Other Important Tips:<br>  Don't forget to breathe.<br>  Since French Kissing is "wetter" than other kinds of kissing it is a good idea to start with dry lips, don't lick them first.<br>  If one of you have braces you can still French Kiss, you just have to be more careful and not as forceful when things get passionate.<br>  If both of you wear braces you can still French Kiss, you just have to be very gentle and avoid touching teeth.<br>  French Kissing takes practice, but at least it is fun to practice this one!<br>  <br>  That's alot of good information.<br>  Have fun =)|`|a279c87e2fbb0b2e3df3f750b0c5f5fdaa	your question isnt really specific but obviously tilt your head move in(so your kissng) and stay for as long as you want.|`|f3fb1639034e9f07cf5baf1927370735aa	Look in the karma sutra|`|abf3a39d81e4ac97ca29622af64f899faa	If you ever pass my way, I'll show you !|`|df0efdf2810c457fd90e41f260e18169aa	you question is not very understandable

iyCQR68naa	She may not know if it is important to ask about you or even then she may not know what to ask!! After all she's still a kid...Help her grow up...|`|2jdWRt3taa	if she is just a kid then that is stupid! just ignore her!!|`|OkRHyL9Zaa	yes go ahead<br>  <br>  rockie|`|Weui9OxNaa	i think your perfect for her. she's obviously a little girl and your obviously a dork.|`|h9008TNeaa	let her go.she is not interested in you.|`|94bb1416c45dabb6f5300d63ad9eee26aa	I think she's just using you to vent. If you want to go for it do it quick. You don't want to invest too much time into her only to find out she's only interested in one-way conversations. <br>  <br>  If a girl is just using a guy's time for attention, it's just as bad as a guy using a girl for sex. But if both parties get what they want out of it then it's a fair deal.<br>  <br>  So #1 know what you want, #2 don't invest to much into it unless you start making progress toward whatever you were looking for. If you're looking for relationship don't mis-read friendship as progress. Women are very good at playing in the gray area to lead you on.|`|AA11901072	I think you should give him another chance,and it is so better that you write for her again and tell her what do you want.|`|AqNdEfOBaa	yeah, give her a chance of friendship first. maybe she just needs someone to confide in and she may not have feelings for you just yet.|`|CAQOMQW3aa	Maybe she is waiting for you to volunteer information, like she is. If she doesn't know you very well yet she might not want to encroach on your boundaries. Or she might feel silly asking questions she feels she'll probably learn in the natural course of a relationship (or friendship). But if you get the vibe that she is just self-involved, you could be right. If you don't want to get to know her there's probably no harm done, but you are interested in her based on what she says, you might not want to jump to conclusions.|`|VRNYgKDeaa	She may be nervous about asking you questions and sometimes when woman get nervous some of us ramble. I would definitely queue in on what she is talking about, for example is she talking on and on about how great she is or is she just giving you information to help get to know her better.|`|eDIO06FVaa	first- she has to know you better to strike interest, <br>  second- at least she is upfront on whom and what she is. On the internet you can be anyone you want to be, at least she is being truthful. I'd say look deeper or let the relationship kinda Fade away|`|eLIKsjc7aa	That's up to you dude.  Could be she doesn't want to pry and is waiting for you to open up.|`|sSVnKlKuaa	Give her a chance. She may also want to know you better by showing or telling you how she is.How long have you been online buddies? Depends also.|`|efb6dadc88cf4ff9816d40f4362a52a7aa	Get back to her, give yourself the benefit of the dark, have nothing to lose.
AA12077420	Communication and understanding each other is the key to a healthy relationship.Sorting out problems as soon as you can helps you sort out issues faster,issues which if left unattended build up and explode in your faces.You girlfriend should be understanding enough to know that asking for time to be able to sort out issues in your relationship does not portray you as needy or clingy.I personally would be happy if my boyfriend asked me that,because it would mean that he really cares about our relationship.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	I believe that talking & communication is the basis of a good relationship; you can resolve problems fast and there's nothing needy or clingy about being sensible. If a relationship is to be successful then both should want to do all they can to make it so.|`|kWaAlV32aa	I agree. Trust and communication. I also think you should take her out and talk to her.|`|FkOnGizTaa	You hit the nail on the head there; communication, especially regarding problems, is the single most integral part of a healthy relationship.  I cannot stress this enough.  Working out the little things as they come up prevents them from festering and degenerating into disasters.<br>  <br>  I don't think asking to sit down and sort out problems will come across as needy or clingy.  If it does come across as such, then that in itself is an enormous problem.<br>  <br>  The key to not making such a request come across as needy/clingy/bitchy is to make her feel comfortable about bringing up her own problems with the relationship, too.<br>  <br>  So, yes, you should talk out whatever problem you have with her.|`|dJUaACflaa	Absolutely - communication is paramount to a successful and healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you're the type of guy who thinks about things - while there is a fine line between that and clingy/needy, I believe it's healthy. I'm the same way - I need to talk things through. My girlfriend and I talk about everything and anything - even the tough stuff.<br>  <br>  Have a chat with her about it - tell her I said you're not being clingy or needy :P|`|eNEgKxfJaa	every healthy relationship needs communication. without that, you tend to miss each other and eventually break up, all because you didnt talk to each other. it happens alot.<br>  <br>  sometimes, when life is just too busy, my bf and i go out about once a month - just the two of us to dinner somewhere and talk. this is like our open night. we talk about anything that bothers us or that we miss or are really enjoying.<br>  <br>  trust me. works like a bomb.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	love, trust, communication sit her down and talk to her and let her know that yall have to communicate.|`|Q13UIQGyaa	trust, love and communication.<br>  if she doesn't have time to talk to you it means she doesn't have time for you, period. you have to start looking at the situation more carefully bro. maybe you are with the wrong one here

People who use the word 'love' with such ease either don't attribute to much meaning or value to that word or don't really know what it means. I suggest that you be cautious and skeptical about such an early love confession since it might be coming from a person who is inexperienced or doesn't know what "love" means.  <br>  <br>  "Loving" requires time and getting to know, as I am sure you well know, and this demands time. <br>  <br>  Thanks. <br>  <br>  Arkady Itkin<br>  www.practicalhappiness.com|`|ce01b8469e307c5857662a0f5f681e47aa	Hey<br>  Then that's probably not love.

b59a5e93dd8a01bd8d43c9e850a25bfdaa	If she's thinking of dumping him b/c of the last name then she's not in love with him.  I always dumped guys for "dumb" reasons and I found out after I found "the one" that those reasons were really just signs that I wasn't in love with those guys.  When you really fall for someone their last name could be booger and you'd happily say "I Do"!  <br>  P.S.  My last name is not booger!  hahaha!|`|0097128b6fd45940acb2a81286b717cbaa	Of course not....would you dump a girl because you hated her first name?|`|AA11549317	She had better|`|AA11110738	This is hilarious!

Smile at her, compliment her on her outfitIf, be open and friendly.If she responds positively to you, then approach her, without being too pushy and follow her lead. Most girls that are interested will definitely let you know, through her demeaner, and her actions, smiles,or being a little flirty.Always be a gentlemen, girls like to be treated with respect.|`|vxGo3Oqxaa	I am not a guy but I think most girls find it cute when guys are attracted to them.

E9JigTskaa	dont get married until your ready to have kids.|`|fPN2KV1Taa	Not really. Actually, 18 is the legal age to leave home and be free to do what you want to do. But, 18 is still young. You'll never know when you'll meet better guys out there. You need to explore the world more. When you get married, those that you can freely do now, might be limited by then. Why? Because you have a COMMITMENT. If you're not sure whether you're ready for this or not, talk to your parents. They've been through that. The reason why your mom reacted was maybe she didn't want you to do the same mistakes she did at your age.  She wants you to be free and taste every trial and accomplishment before you go up that altar. <br>  <br>  And by the way, it doesn't hurt to study a bit at home. Although you're not studying anymore, it still helps to exert a bit effort in your studies at home. You're gonna need that when you grow up and look for a job.  :)<br>  <br>  Be free girl. Party. Hang out with pals. Do whatever you want to do. But marrying isn't an option for an 18-year old girl like you. :)|`|FzFSzilmaa	if your life is full, and you have no ambitions to see the world and experience all that life has to offer, then get married...<br>  <br>  just remember, later on, when you think about all you failed to do in your life, it was your choice... :D|`|0Mx0Aie3aa	Getting married is serious-  too many people today dont treat it as such and that is why we have so many failed marriages.  Marriage is meant to be a sacred union between you, your man and God.  If you treat it seriously and work at it, it can be sucessful. Starting that relationship when you're still so young can make your marriage even more challenging. <br>  If you love this man and you want to marry him, than there is no harm in waiting.  Set a date with him and your mother.  Wait until your 20.  If he is the right man for you than the 2 more years will only make your relationship stronger.  <br>  Marriage takes a lot of work.  It doesn't just happen.  Just because you know people who have made it after getting married so young doesn't mean there aren't hundreds who didn't.  I think your mother may not be opposed to you marrying this man, but she wants you to have every opportunity to have a loving, fufilling, sucessful marriage, and getting married at 18 will just add another obstacle.<br>  You and boyfriend need to make a plan.  Start saving your money, start looking for someplace to live, start discussing things with your mother and create a timetable.  If you have a priest or mininster, start talking to him and start praying about what God wants for you.  Talk to other married couples, not just ones who were married young, and discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of marriage.  <br>  Waiting a few years won't hurt your relationship and it will show your mother that you're serious about getting married and you're commited to making it a sucess.<br>  I was married when I was 22 and I knew nothing!!!  It is hard, and it takes a lot of time and effort to keep it going, so please try to give yourself every advantage you can!!|`|9PChI0Bxaa	Yes. Marriage is something of a failing institution. First of all, why do you want to be married? Do you believe that if you're married temptation will be more easily refuted? You don't need to be married to someone to give yourself to them in mind and body. All that marriage does is lets the government in on your personal life. And if things don't work out, it takes a lot of effort, time, and money to break up. By the way, you should go to college. We need more educated Americans in this world, believe me.|`|t1ljRWgPaa	It's a toughie, for sure. I was engaged at 17 and was supposed to get married the day after my 18th birthday. A week after my mom bought me the dress of my dreams, I realised I was making a mistake. Fortunately, it wasn't too late. Yes, it's a little weird having my wedding dress hanging on the back of my bedroom door now, but it reminds me that instead of condemning myself to marry a selfish, immature man and be stuck as an army wife for the rest of my days, I am free to be 18 and have fun. When you turn 18, you think it won't be a big deal but when you suddenly realise all the things you will be legally able to do, you want to be free to explore those possibilities. I'm not sure where you are, but where I am the drinking age is 18. No, I don't go out drinking every night acting like some kind of tramp, but I have the freedom to go out and have fun with my girlfriends, if I so choose, without the responsibility of being married. You may not want to go to college now, but one day something may strike you and you may have an opportunity you want to make the most of. Maybe you'll suddenly find a burning ambition to travel and see the sights of the world, or undertake some kind of training. But if you have a husband, who is settled in his job and doesn't want to move, or can't afford to support you, you can't do those things you want to do. Your mom just doesn't want to see you throw your life away. At your age (I hate to patronise) there is still so much you haven't seen or done, and so many people you haven't met yet. Give yourself time. You have your whole life to get married, but you'll only be 18 once.

If it ended bad, stay away and don't restart something that ended 14 months ago.  If you do decide to meet him for a friendly "hello" perhaps meeting for drinks wouldn't be the best idea.  Alcohol tends to make us all act/feel a little different, which could lead both of you into a totally different direction.  Again, just because he's your x doesn't mean you have to hate him.  Personally, I never go back.  Friendships can remain, but there must be respect and understanding.  The fact is, the relationship ended  for a reason.  Some people just get along better as friends.

If the House is not in her or your dads name then he should not be able to take half of it but really she needs to get the right solicitors advice.  Look up legal aid online and find a solicitor in your area set up a free appointment and see what they have to say - even if u have to do it yourself my love at least you will get some clarity.

That needs to be done.<br>  Your father may be behaving badly towards you but you cant change how HE behaves, you can only change how YOU behave in reaction to what he does. You really ought to regard hs promises as nothing more than hot air. Depend on yourself and you will not be disappointed. Let him promise big dreams but if you are not taken in and just work hard to get where you want to be it will feel twice the acheivement when you get there that you did it without any help from him.

When you are done, he will be the most stunned creature on the planet, he'd probably shut up for a month, but what's worse is he will start accusing you of cheating. Stupid men don't know what they want. My hubby was like that as well, now that i'm SEXY he has a problem with it too. Must i come and give you a major makeover. Where are you? Start being the sexy lady he wants and see where that ends up.

He might like you too, but he might be afraid to ask you out so you have to do it<br>  your  idea for coffee or something is good.  Do not offer money instead pay for the coffee save that  money for after when you two get really into each other so you can go out and have fun.<br>  <br>  You can get a date with out money don't worry.  bribe him with sex if none of that works.  Hit me up & let me know how it goes good luck. <br>  <br>  My friend was telling me about his cute girl that 19 that he likes but he shy 36 years old hey I think you know him ask him out! <br>  <br>  I work hard on my answer I better get the best answer.|`|yotwdgZyaa	Hi just offer him sex, that usually works.|`|UTxsatcJaa	no, then he will be just using you for your money, don't be desperate be yourself|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Do not...

What happens when all they want is money? You have to offer who you are, not money.<br>  90% of people are scared of rejection because it sucks - but it's what keeps us on our toes. I'm sure you have a lot to offer - money is not the right thing though.

GOOD LUCK|`|UPfWOpO5aa	you shouldn't need to bribe anyone to go out with you<br>  you sound like a lovely person and just need to built up some self-esteem<br>  this guy sounds nice and if you ask he will probably go out with you to coffee it may just as friends but you never know things could develop,<br>  just be yourself and not try to make someone be with you just cause they have been bribe with money.<br>  anyone who is takes that bribe is not worth hanging out with in the first place.<br>  there other ways to solve this without resorting to bribes<br>  just be yourself the worst that could happen is that he says he's not that into you but at least you know he's not pretending to like you for an alternative reason, but things could always work out for the best<br>  just take a risk<br>  its alot less riskier than offering a bribe<br>  hope thats helped :)|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Forget the bribe, he would think you very strange & destroy any chance you might have with him!<br>  Just ask him out for a drink/ film / snack - unless you go for it you will never enjoy your life.<br>  You can't buy love! maybe you can buy sex but you need to talk to friends or make some friends, both sexes, one might turn out to be special?<br>  Rejection happens all the time so don't let that worry you, the world is too full of people, so many to date! ever tried a dating site/agency?|`|dSpLfZFnaa	You are not real so you should have to pay for it.|`|XGZBEdAWaa	Are you crazy? Just get over your shyness and ask him out, he'll probably jump at the chance ( guys love younger girls ).<br>  <br>  If you think that you have to bribe a guy to go out with you then that's just sad i'm sure there are lots of guys looking to date you.|`|FzFSzilmaa	not this AGAIN...<br>  <br>  just tell him how you feel and what you want... older guys will ALWAYS go for younger women!!! i know i would... unless she was fat or hideous...|`|GoEaSOSraa	I'm sorry, but your are stupid and desperate. First off, you're not mature for your age because you actually posted a question asking  whether or not you should bribe a man to go out with you. Secondly, since you're a teenager I am assuming that you work somewhere that pays minimum wage or slightly above that. Now ask yourself what a 36 year old man (who is not married) would be doing working there. Does he not have any goals in life? Or is he a manager? Good to know that you realize you have low self-esteem, but I think it must be realllly low. And if a guy really liked you and if you really liked him, no bribing would be necessary. If you want to spend $400 on a damn coffee date, go get a hooker and maybe then you can have your first kiss, sexual experience AND date all in one night. Don't act so hopeless. It isn't attractive. You're still young, give yourself a chance|`|qsqmykzsaa	No way. don't even think about bribing him.<br>  you are worth way more than that. <br>  As you are already friends, why not ask him to go with you for a coffee or something like that after work.<br>  just smile and be yourself. you can't realistically be anything else.<br>  i have had so many men friends try to get in to my pants, but without success.<br>  if he likes you, he will let you know.<br>  try the coffee, but definately not for money. Get real girl. you are a worthwhile person.

People get caught up with life sometimes, so you might not talk to friends for weeks or months.  If they are really your friend you should be able to pick up where you left off when you talk to them again.
mUWcPX6taa	What you need is time away from this person. If that's not an option then hang out with your closest friends as much as possible, and do things you enjoy more often than before. maybe write poetry or music. if you don't play or like to write then go out and take some walks, ride a bike. But one of the best things is to start talking to someone else. not necessarily date but if your open for dating then go right ahead. another guy especially someone you find interesting or that has a little thing for you can definitely work to help you get over this guy. Don't think of it as just a "rebound" just look at it as moving on and meeting new people. who knows. maybe the next guy could be someone to sweep you off your feet. I recently had my heart broken (and still recovering) and i'm doing pretty dang well. better than i thought i would be. all because i don't speak, text, email, see, whatever with the girl that broke it. I'm doing exactly what i'm advising you to do. though its only been three weeks since this girl broke my heart i'm trying to meet new women and maybe date. because what other option do i have? Life is too short to dwell and be sad/depressed. Just keep your head up, stay busy, and keep close to your friends. Things will work out the way they were supposed to and you'll find someone better that will make life worth while. :)|`|FzFSzilmaa	because he's getting it on with someone else... :D|`|PHp71Xt7aa	Accept that you are not meant to be together & that you deserve better. <br>  Forget about him for a while & focus on yourself you sound like a greattt person & that you deserve someone who doesn't treat you like this (i don't know all the details though).<br>  <br>  Obviously you are someone who falls in love & gets close to people, & I know that you can find the right guy.<br>  <br>  So, the best way to get over a guy?<br>  <br>  - don't think about him.. It's hard because you always do<br>  - try not to like him... how can you just stop your feelings?<br>  - but overall the best step is to start liking someone else.. it's as simple as that<br>  <br>  get a new obsession, stare at him until he catches you... smile at him & even if you don't like him that much in the beginning, you will begin to & it will be great...<br>  <br>  You will have fun & the butterflies will start & that is where the new relationship will blossom =)<br>  <br>  goodluck! xxxxx

6ec19ad4c5777281a858c2fff697a91caa	Depends on how old you are, how old the kids are, and how much you know about the father of the kids.

I won't consider dating a woman with kids before I turn about 35, unless perhaps she's a widow and an awesome person.  I, along with most single guys who don't have children, don't want to date women with children.  So my limit is zero for all practical purposes.  There could possibly be exceptions, but I won't go into those.<br>  <br>  What's so hard about not having children before getting into a stable marriage?  It's not rocket science.  And don't try to generalize about men either to say that we're all dogs (or whatever the man-haters are saying these days).  If you got with some chump and got knocked up, that's your fault and his.  Not all men are that way, and you probably rejected some decent guys to be with a loser who didn't care about more than sex anyway.  I'm not trying to be mean, but I've seen way too much of that these days and it's very annoying sometimes.  Some guys will date you, but I think you might initially have some trouble finding guys who will.  The older you get, the better your chances are.  I think you would have better luck with single fathers as well.  Good night!|`|AA12216669	I prefer women with kids because they are more mature and responsible. I think 4 would be the limit but it doesn't really matter how many.

Doesn't mean that men don't want to date a woman with kids but she should understand him not wanting to dive right into being a dad.  Men want to date a woman not her brood but should he fall in love with her, then he will learn to love the kids in time.|`|cf8c1d077ed9e16e1e222bdc567793a4aa	i've decided to avoid them now, because i don't want kids in the first place<br>  <br>  also you have to ask why they didn't have kids with a good man who they were married to.  in all honesty, it's a bad sign.  chances are they made the most important decision of their life with a total jerk.  <br>  <br>  then there's the "need a baby daddy" factor.  the women are looking for a daddy, not just a husband and it depends on if the guy can deal with that.

935d5c15d8e44c3201273b27180839a3aa	Utilizar condòn en una relaciòn que recièn comienza ES SANO, no solo se evita el embarazo sino las enfermedades de transmisiòn sexual. En una relaciòn estable, se utiliza por los mismos motivos (nunca se sabe la "fidelidad del otro") y creo que para dejar de usar forro o condòn, por respeto y amor al otro, hay que hacerse un estudio que confirme la ausencia de enfermedades sexuales (HIV, HPV, Blenorragia, Gonorrea, clamidias, Sìfilis, etc) y luego elegir otro metodo de control de natalidad.

1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	if he hasn't told you already then he might not have the same sentiments towards you
AA12167030	First of all, let your fiance know what's going on in your friend's life and let her know that this girl is close to you as in family close, not romantic close.  She will probably not be spuer-pleased, but at least she will have an opportunity to talk to you about her thoughts and feelings on the whole thing.  Second, make an effort to only spend time with your model friend in public places.  Don't be super-obvious about this; it will only hurt her feelings, but always suggest going to a coffee shop or restaurant or the mall, etc. to spend time and talk.  This will make it a lot harder for her to put the moves on you and ease some of the fears your fiance might have about you spending time with this girl.  Lastly, if your fiance absolutely does not want you spending time with this girl, then don't.  Yes, she should trust you, but think about how you'd feel if some stud-looking pro athlete friend of hers who has a crush on her suddenly started needing a lot of her attention.  You'd have some reservations, too.  At the end of the day, all you can do is support people; they have to want to save themselves.|`|AA10427673	just talk to her---ask ur fiance if u can take her to dinner---maybe take both of them to dinner-------and just let her know that u r there for her as a friend but have a person that u love dearly and are not going to cheat on---not hard at all|`|AA12257241	what makes you think that the only way you can make her feel better is to have sex with her or soemthing like that? dont be an asshole. you can talk to her and make her feel better without doing anything to hurt your fiance. its not THAT hard of a concept really. come on.|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	That is the sweetest thing ever! Explain to her that while she is a beautiful person, you truly are in love with your future wife. Let her know that you will do anything you can to make her feel better. Go out to a singles club with her for moral support, and show her that there are other fish in the sea!|`|A7m8DFgkaa	I think you should steer clear of the whole thing.  It sounds like you might be just a little tempted and are trying to convince yourself otherwise.  If you truly love your girlfriend you shouldn't put yourself in a place where you might betray her.  I'm sure the model has plenty of other shoulders to cry on.|`|35bBaSTxaa	Well, just make her realize that you do not want to go in that direction with her. Just be clear about that. Just spend as much time as you feel like with her as a "friend." You could check up on her with a call every now and again. You could invite her to things that you do with a group of people. You could get her a little gift of some sort just as "thinking of you." She is a friend...so you can do things for her as long as you stay within some boundaries. Just treat her as positively as possible and tell her some of the things you mention on here. Let her know she is worthwile and beautiful and that you care about her and want her to do well and not go back to self-destructive behavior. I think you can make it work.
9p6EnV2caa	I understand how you can be confused about this man.  It must be very difficult for you.  You haven't seen him in four months?   He seems to be very immature for shaking things in your face and playfully hitting you.  Men are like a chunk of coal.  You may have to search through lots of coal to find a diamond.  I realize that it must be very difficult to forget about this man but try to move on.  You seem very nice and I know that there is a special diamond out there waiting for you.  Go find you true love.|`|HeSCyy7paa	i love how you just throw "he fingered me" in there all nonchalant|`|Q13UIQGyaa	he wanted you and he knows he can get you any time he wants. forget him cos he doesn'tdeserve you.|`|kmuusBkGaa	Fingering you while driving you home shows his disrespect for you..

If someone loves you, they can't wait that long to see you again..|`|LoB3g56waa	Lol. You should have realized he liked you as soon as you noticed he stared/smiled at you. And the fact that he playfully hits you and the fact that he FINGERED YOU. Of course he likes you.|`|Q67ZgqJgaa	He sounds like a bit of a douchebag to me...are sure he's even worth the worry?  You said it yourself that he has taken advantage of you.   He doesn't seem like a winner.
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	just for a fraction of a second but not really - c'mon use your imagination - you are intelligent.
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	It's very interesting how you see it and how the onlookers will see this. You are so blinded by the affection for this dude that you have in some ways forgotten that you are a person. He does  not deserve you. Get out and take off the blinding glasses you are wearing, grow a backbone and tell him to buzz off.

1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	Play cool - you are in a drivers seat - take your time to pick and choose. If they aren't any good find another. You matter most, so your happiness should be your priority.
TR1dMvRLaa	I wish I could tell you that all you have to do is tell her this or that, and the problem will be solved.  But honestly, it doesn't work that way.  You can beg and plead, and give her reason after reason to leave him, but it's not gonna work.  Trust me, I've known several people in similar situations, unfortunately it seems to be very common among women these days, as it has been forever.  I don't know why people convince themselves that they need this person, or that there's no one else out there for them.  The best thing you can do is tell her what's on your mind, what evidence you have.  That way, when he slips up you'll have a clear conscience in knowing that you tried, and so she wont come back saying " As my best friend, if you knew something, why didn't you tell me?"  Other than that, it's a mistake she's gonna have to learn from on her own, as much as I know it hurts you to step away.  All you can really do is be there for her when it happens.|`|ZyyX1jDqaa	Intervention, your friend & love one is in desperate need of an intervention.. You need to gather all her love, family, mom,dad,brothers etc. in one room and everyone share with her how much you guys care for her & that you are concern for her well being. Open up the big picture for her that she notice that this loser has a former wife, kids etc, who probably don't won't anything to do with him. Get a background check he's probably has physically abuse others. If this guy gets her to move out of town she will be a brain wash prisoner in this guys world.|`|f24051b4b1e69bc5e4eb21543e4c6de8aa	girl you need to step up and do something cause possessiveness can turn into something ugly...her low self esteem doesn't help and it's probably gotten worse because he's probably told her things to make her feel like she needs him which is not true and you need to break this to her try to do w.e you can even if she loves him she can't love him that much her life may be at stake form what you say

KLFVEUtGaa	I think that she is at least interested!  I mean... she has made a move to figure out if you like her or not, most girls wouldn't do that unless they really wanted to know, because they like you back.

rtXUj7uqaa	Hi sweety i would suggest u to give the letter to the  guy. This would be helpful in two ways one even if he doesn't comes back to you u will have the satisfaction that u didn't missed the opportunity to convey ur feelings to him which could haunt u if u didn't give him the letter second thing is he might realize the mistake he has done and may come back to u. All the best.|`|R0U4qy6haa	you already broke up--move on it is already over you BROKE UP|`|FzFSzilmaa	i wouldn't care...<br>  <br>  and would probably dump the letter without reading it...<br>  <br>  seems you are the only one with issues, not him...<br>  <br>  move on with your life, he has...|`|kBxnWx3Qaa	Just give it to him. He deserves it and he can think all he wants.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	If it makes you feel good and gives you closer then by all means give it to him honey.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	It depends on what happened that night and how well u have written it, If it is onesided, that is your side, or if u r pointing accusing fingers at him, then he may not like it, <br>  but the best thing would be to talk it over with him, if he stays close by<br>  If he stays long distance then post it to him.<br>  But a personal touch is always better.
HVKfuhp3aa	I agree, it can be fun, but it's not really worth it. Personally, I'd rather grab a group of friends and go hang out at a mall, bowling alley, or someone's house then get all dressed up and pay to get in a dance. I haven't experienced prom yet, and I doubt I will. It's too costly for a few hours of "fun" whereas I can go pay a few bucks a movie theatre. I can't dance either so that doesn't help. :P <br>  I did go to homecoming, and that was ridiculously boring. I had more fun going out to eat before. :/|`|AA10661392	Proms are a waste of time.

5mEudm9Haa	By being selfless.  If both of you are always looking after the each other's best interests, then there should be minimal conflict.  Conversation is key.  If you are too mad to talk about a subject, tell your spouse and agree to talk about it in an hour or a day, etc.  BTW, the world would be such a better place if everyone acted selfless.  Everyone would be looking out for everyone else.  Relationships would be more grounded.  Man, would that be a happy place.  The Golden Rule is the most important in life.  To treat others as you would like to be treated.  It helps to get you what you want too.  So many people want to bully their way into getting what they want, but it's so much easier if everyone else is pulling for you! =)|`|fdnbXfvfaa	We got married because I loved him and realized I would be lost if he wasn't in my life. So when he asked, I said yes.<br>  We stay married because we love each other to much to let the little things tear us apart.<br>  If we have a problem we talk it out, rather thing just letting it linger|`|FzFSzilmaa	by getting conned into marriage.. then being too scared to end it... for fear of being alone or having to start a new relationship... :D|`|DytsjZKpaa	loyalty, honesty.|`|EENUWAP7aa	You stay married only if that's what you want. People are subject to change their minds even after three children. There are no guarantees.
ADY7U1yQaa	as a guy ill say this.  make him look for you.  dont call him too much or nothing like that.  see if he takes the time to look for you.  guys like control and power.  if he knows that you would do anything for him then he will feel like he owns you in a weird way.  pretend like you dont need or want him and see what he does see if he does not care or see if he floods your phone with calls thinking that he will lose you.  let him make the next move.  you will get your answer then.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Ah u reposted.

He lost his virginity to you, and you to him.  You need to marry each other.  You guys are much older, and you need to tell him to make you a child and get you pregnant now.  If he goes for it, then, he is definately serious.  If you do fall apart later due to communication problems etc., that does not mean that he isnt sincere now.|`|5agXk9ldaa	well i think you have to give him a chance <br>  but try to take it slowley, in case of another heart brock <br>  good luck my friend|`|estIQEVNaa	I would say go for it, just be a little cautious.  But everything happened in high school.  Things change.
Wi9nmYIEaa	something that is lacking in most long term commitments is ......anticipation....it is just as much about the lead up as what it is about the act.....get into his mind.....because that is an erogenous zone too :  )|`|AA11777322	If you are married you should know what he likes or doesn't like.  Try new things and see if he likes it.  You can usually tell if he moans and groans with pleasure.|`|73e1265991767c4d53c4fa95c30f49e6aa	You need to open the lines of communication when you are having sex. Tell and ask each other what you like and how to do it. If you can't do that then you shouldn't be having sex. It's not embarrassing to satisfy you bf.|`|FzFSzilmaa	offer to do anything and everything with/for/to him!!! :D|`|8OBKSgHgaa	I would suggest you give him the adequate amount of Head in preparation.|`|sRYsux2kaa	Cup his balls and stroke his shaft
AA11969451	Don't give a man credit for who you are. Learn to validate yourself and realize your self worth. Never have sex just to please another. That kind of intimacy should be equally enjoyed...not endured.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	ur life is not messed up...<br>  <br>  if ur not in the mood for sex, just tell him. they guy wont know if you don't tell him.<br>  <br>  and if u don't want to tell him, don't make such a bid deal out of it, i mean... we all make a few compromises here and there to make our loved ones happy. Have you ever thought that there might have been a time when HE was too tired but still did it for YOU.<br>  <br>  everyone has those days when ur simply too tired to get all touchy... just tell him, a mature guy will understand. say it nicely and just make sure u don't make it sound like a rejection.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11777322	I think that sex should be enjoyable for the both of you.  You should talk with your partner and see if he can tone it down a bit.  If its that you have issues with it, then maybe you should seek out counseling.  Not really sure of it being a messed up life.  Sometimes you just don't feel like it.  But if you do have issues then not discussing it could lead to problems later on for you.  What you don't want to do is get to a point where you don't want to at all.  This will make him seek it somewhere else.  I wish you luck with this.  Just remember communication is key.  In addition, if a person loves you they will never make you feel uncomfortable during sex.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	i cant think of anything worse that could happen to anyone, infact instead of wishing bad upon my enemies from now on i  wish that they all have great sex and loads of it. This is clearly far more worse than anything i could think up.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Having sex with your fiance does not make your life messed up.|`|oq8F1qfUaa	youre fine...|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Not really. Nobody can help the way they feel about sex, and sometimes if you feel you must do this because its not fair to deprive him, then do it. But never tell him that you're just doing it for the sake of it or he'll be extremely hurt. Statistically, men want sex more than women do anyone, so don't feel bad about it!|`|sa64sQUXaa	Nothing wrong with it at all, I think you need to talk with him about it and setup some ground rules. You both have to be happy with the amount you are getting. Besides, it is better that he knows now than later and end up in divorce from feeling emotionally disconnected.|`|D0CXimeAaa	It's not wrong at all... you love him, so you give him what he wants. Perfectly normal behaviour at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  But, it's up to you. If you don't want to have sex, don't be scared to tell him. I'm sure he'll understand. He might even try and be more romantic, which would help get you in the mood :)|`|dJoE8yedaa	No, you are normal, but it would be better if you enjoyed it as much as he did. Look on the lovehoney.com website for some thing to boost your desires under 'sexual health' heading. There's gels and pills that work and their delivery is free. eg, try taking something when he gets home or before. They recommend to take half an hour before, but with me it took longer to work. Maybe you can entice him for a change. I'm sure you'd both like that.|`|SckWdjnVaa	Nothing wrong at all...its natural tat some/most of the guys tend to have more sexual urge than a gal & to not hurt them, u do it!!!<br>  <br>  Try not to count the number of times u do...instead, enjoy whenever u do...u ll not hv to fake it then! Its all in the mind after all .... :)|`|3Rp6dZetaa	listen about the sex part.. don't just do it because u love the guy.. Hun u have to do it from you heart and that's when it matters. just doing it like that, is showing that u don't have feeling for passion..|`|JsczmTaxaa	no you're fine.|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	its to pls him which means your being a good girl friend|`|1K7nKZ72aa	Just wait until you marry him, He'll be complaining then.
j0mI8l07aa	Awesome question! I'll not just tell you which but why!<br>  I'll start with the flattering:<br>  Earrings - just classic sexy, a given.<br>  Eyebrow - just one can look really sexy on the right girl, but she has to have nice natural eyebrows, it doesn't look good on drawn eyebrows.<br>  Belly Button - but you really do need kind of a small waist to pull it off.<br>  Clitoris- big big turn on. It just screams, I love sex, and am a naughty girl at heart.<br>  Tongue- lets us know you're not averse to putting things in your mouth.<br>  And now the unflattering:<br>  Lip - It's just gets in the way of everything.<br>  Labia- Jewels are nowhere near as flattering hanging off the lips than adorning the clitoris.<br>  Nose- THE ABSOLUTE WORST. Rings make you look like a cow, and studs just look like boogers. Huge turn-off.<br>  Over doing it- 15 earrings? 5 eyebrow rings? 4 lip rings? Too much of anything takes away from the sexiness.<br>  <br>  Nipples? - I'm kinda torn on this one, I've seen some that looked good and others that didn't. I think it depends on the girl, the piercing itself, and the breasts. Too many variables.|`|5fwIsT9Baa	Belly button or ears if only one on each ear some girls have like 7 ear rings on each ear and it looks manky|`|FzFSzilmaa	facial - bad<br>  nipples/other intimate - VERY SEXY!!!|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	None.<br>  A woman's body is just fine without ugly bits of metal jutting out.

hz7Ek1HKaa	Nobody should ever get mad at you because you don't want to have sex. Your body is foremost yours and if a person disrespects that I can see how that would lead to problems.<br>  Seems to me you have 2 choices:<br>  <br>  a. go to counseling, try to work it out<br>  b. divorce your husband!!|`|klBtqahOaa	Wow your the reason why men turn to drink, being abusive towards women.

YOUR HAVING SEX WITH YOUR AFFAIR!<br>  <br>  I think your a gutless wife that whats her cake and eat it. I bet you couldn't help your self with the guy your sleeping with so mentally you make it feel right to your self by comparing him to your husband and how your poor husband lacks. <br>  <br>  Do your husband a favor and leave him so he can meet a decent women who has pride and self respect as well as compassion for other people especially their HUSBAND! You give decent women a bad name, hey theres whore houses you can work in.|`|RgINbeNFaa	its funny to see affair, friend and respect in one (or two) sentences.  If you and your friend respected each other as well as yourselves he would tell you and you him that you need to fix whatever problems you have at home first.  but then i bet the problems didnt start until your "respectful friend" started tapping that ***.  he respects you as much as he respects his own family.|`|477c4a9bb14fc9e7f41eea433175604faa	yeah, it sounds like your friend really respects u. ur just the *** hes not getting frm his wife because shes icing him like u did to yours.so messed up the lengths ppl go to live a lie. life is too short.move on or move out.ps.this isnt a question|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	You and your friend are  both cheaters.

She was looking for something (the grass is greener) and never found it.<br>        I had to laugh at her though. The guy, her boss, she was infatuated with him. He took her out in the hay field one time, couldn't wait to get in her pants, barely got her pants down and lost his load all over her pants, legs and his own pants, she said it last ten maybe fifteen seconds.<br>        We had four kids, her parents were moving to Florida and she said she would leave if that's what I wanted. I told her fine, start packing. She was at her parents house two days waiting for them. She came back crying she wanted me and the kids. <br>         I told her I would think about it. I took her back. The kids never found out the reasons, they think it was something I did. That was 38 years ago. A family skeleton.<br>  <br>         This little affair ruined three lives. He got the crap beat out of him. His wife kicked him out, he's still out, his wife divorced him. He's the town drunk. I can forgive but, it's hard to forget. She knows it's a shadow in our lives.<br>  <br>          That's my reaction. If this is the case, tell your husband you want a divorce and don't cheat, it hurts worse.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I would seek counseling for you and your marriage. I wonder why he treats you that way. he may have had thing in his past that makes him do that, or he may just see you as a cheating spouse. you should have tried that before you cheated, but we all make mistakes. you need to realize that he needs to learn how to fix that problem if he is ever going to make it work in any relationship. tell him that you want to talk to him about these problems. you also need to tell him you want it to work. I can see you feel some guilt because of your question. you need to keep it in mind that your friend now see's you as a cheating spouse and the relationship will never be good. they will always feel like you may look for a reason to cheat on them without trying to work it out.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	If you don't have any children with your husband, then dump him now before you get pregnant.

8y2r8Jtjaa	At this steakhouse I work at, I see ugly guys that have money scoring hot chicks all the time.

Even if the love of your life had not passed away just because he was the love of your life doesn't mean you are cheating on your husband. I had a love of my life, i know we'll never be together but that doesn't mean i'm cheating on my husband. <br>  <br>  Well you could do a lot worse than spend the rest of your life with your best friend! There are many unhappy relationships where people don't care for each other deeply.  Are you still attracted to each other, do you have a healthy sex life?  Are you sure you are not having unrealistic expectations of a relationship? <br>  <br>  If you have children together and he isyour best friend and you care for each other deeply there's not a great deal wrong. But if you are saying you're not attracted to him, i can see that is a problem.  How about you put all your efforts into this relationship and stop dreaming about a "love of your life" that may not exist in reality?  You may find that the one you are with is it?|`|cN6AMupIaa	Stay - what you have is a caring partner who adores you and his kids ,if you left it will make so many unhappy souls and your kids will not be happy away from their dad - if the only reason you want to go is because you are still in love with someone that is dead, why would you split up a happy family for memories that you can cherish for what once was, but is gone. Keep what you have now and have a good life.|`|AA10140520	If the one you loved passed away, then you need to decide if you're happy with the one you're with now, but if you don't feel happy, you may have to loose your recent lover, wait & pray you see your true love that passed away when your time comes-(I'm truely sorry to hear it,-but that may lead to sad & loneliness, depression, & a possible divorce).|`|DTN6Vg8caa	dont be selfish , u shd have atleast thought abt this before the kids dont mess their lifes
ksZfTHyQaa	Reading the additional details on how the person you love has passed away kind of changes how I initially thought when I read your question. I think that with that, I'd definitely stay. The person you're in love with is no longer on this earth, but you have someone by your side that you still care a lot for- I believe you said you loved him? You have kids with him and you say he's your best friend so that makes it easier to say yes to staying. It's hard to not have the person you're in love with by your side, but it doesn't sound like you have a horrible situation because you say you care deeply for the person you're with and they do the same for you. As hard as it may be, perhaps the best thing you can do is to try to be happy with your current partner and to love them.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	A relationship is built on love and trust and the faith of god,so the best thing that i can tell you to do is pray to god and follow your heart.|`|8hkY00b7aa	I'd rather arrange that by to whom is more addicted on me let say..<br>  "Dont seek who you like, cause you'll lose it soon or later, seek whom likes you"<br>  mean by that who's already proving the love..<br>  good luck.|`|s3gs4JLAaa	it's kinda complicated situation for u, i don't know what to say cuz only u who can decide it ok.|`|5yHgNH4gaa	yes go for it if u think is right.|`|0ZRgzrPhaa	Good Friends can be like riding a mule boring and  predictable  witch does has its perks, and real love can be like bull riding ...I would find a way to show both sides to one mate.|`|UGpahoMGaa	stay together and try working it out at least for the kids sake. try until u can;t anymore. don;t let ur problems mess up ur kids they are mainly ur concern|`|AA11416725	yes just go for it and you too will live a good life together.|`|7cBvmw37aa	depends on finances... if things are bad, then yes, i'd stay... but i'd ask for an open marriage... :D|`|FzFSzilmaa	depends on finances... if things are bad, then yes, i'd stay... but i'd ask for an open marriage... :D
Ui7WuDrJaa	Sometimes running away and starting over may sound like a better way to deal with our problems and frustrations but at those times is good to remember what road you've came down to get where you are. I am not going to judge you, for I know it feels good to have somebody who is all flowers, but when you don't know somebody it's really easy to just say nice things about them, it gets harder as you share every little detail of your life and it seems that's where you find your marriage. Don't invest too much on the other guy, at least not while you're still married. No, your marriage is not over, maybe you both just need to put a bit more effort on making it work. In the end, it is worth trying, you've lived a life with this man and your daughter deserves a family. If it doesn't work, at least you'll know that you gave it your best and that you too need to be happy, of course happier with your family together, but not everything is perfect. Give it a try with your husband, remember what made you fall for him and what has kept you together, as for his family, you knew it was going to be a part of the package, we just learn to deal with it.Remember that you too deserve to be happy and we can't find happiness if there are questions left in our heads, making us wonder about unresolved issues. Work on one thing at a time.<br>  Best|`|hJZWMkFZaa	no, what you are doing is wrong, work on your marriage, even if things are tough right now, if you dont love him anymorem you should tell him|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	he is not your other mr right.....your husband is that....but you have lost that through a breakdown of communication....and unless you get off your butt and do something about it.....you marriage will be over....the grass is not always greener....I realy cant see any evidence from your story on anything you have tried to save your marriage.....do you actually want to .....or are you just trying to appease your conscience by getting other people to endorse your plan of action with the other guy.....one word for you.....counselling .....good luck :  )|`|afFUs27kaa	dont cheat, if you are that tempted then maybe your marriage is on the rocks you either need to talk to your husband, go to counseling sessions etc. you are already having an emotional affair <br>  its ok to be close to family, but your husband needs to realise that you and your daughter are his family and the ones he should now be protecting and loving really talk to him dont give money to his family, if they dont like you then they never will some ppl just dont like other ppl.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	You must talk wih your husband.<br>  Don't whine and moan to him !<br>  There is a serious lack of communication in your relationship.<br>  <br>  I suggest you write him a letter, explaining your fears.<br>  AND perhaps what you think are your mistakes.<br>  <br>  This new guy, for sure, is providing what is missing in your marriage.<br>  All new relationships START this way, with romance, comforting and sweet talk. For sure your marriage started this way.<br>  But why is he doing this ? <br>  You say he "loves" you, what crap, he's never even met you. He is trying to sneak between your legs darling !<br>  <br>  Well you got married for a reason, and THAT is love. <br>  <br>  Let me ask you some personal questions........<br>  When was the last time you tried "seducing" your husband ?<br>  For example wearing sexy clothes for HIM, or sending him sexy messages ?<br>  Have you really tried comforting or cuddling him ?, perhaps he too misses these things.<br>  Your husband has suffered a huge loss, and you are talking to another man for your needs, what about your husbands needs ?<br>  Why are you not close to your husbands relatives ?<br>  Why don't you have enough time to go out with your husband ?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but it seems to me YOU have given up too easily, and your husband senses this.<br>  He is now going to his friends and family for the comfort you should be in part providing.<br>  I think, to a point, you have brought this upon yourself.|`|0ab338083fcb7da711184c99120b9ba5aa	First, end what amounts to an emotional affair with the other guy.  If you need to talk, speak to a minister or marriage counselor.  As for your marriage, it must and will change.  It will either end, or you two will decide to work on the problems and issues that are separating you  You both have a lot invested in your relationship for it to have lasted 9 years.  Don't just give up on it without fighting to save and improve it.  You CAN'T fix it on your own, because you didn't screw it up on your own..  Speak to your husband seriously, and MAKE him understand that things are going to change.  It will take both of you working together to fix your marriage.

Like some free consoling service or something. Your question leaves out a lot of information. Mostly because there is to much to write because there are so many things that can factor in on his behavior. But from what I can see, he blames you for him not being able to go to the party.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Estelle, some men don't feel sorry for you even if you're on your deathbed. I have a man like that. The trick is to pretend you don't care, and guess what. He'll start thinking that when he's gone you will be meeting someone else behind his back and he'll change his tune very fast. It's called reverse psychology. So start having a life, get your hair and nails done, go to the movies, even if you are alone and you'll soon have him eating out of your hands.|`|dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Women are much better at expressing themselves than men are. It's genetic. If you are still sick, just tell him he can go to this party without you. My guess is that he'd like to (or would have liked to ) go, but didn't want to risk making you angry by asking you.  As far as him never asking  if you want anything to drink and everything, I don't think that means anything.  Many loving guys are just clueless when it comes to nurturing. Don't punish him for it. when the time is right just tell him that next time you are sick, it would make you feel loved and cared for if he would check in on you and ask if you want any water or broth or anything. Then just to make it clear, say "So next time I'm sick, I want you to ask me if I want water or anything, ok?"  Sometimes its up  to the one who is better at nurturing to sort of teach the other one.  Also, I would like to say that guys don't pick up on hints. They just don't. If they ask if anything is wrong  and you say NO (when really something is bothering), they go away happy believing the answer is no.  That's just the way they are.  it's up to you to be straightforward, but kind.  My guess is he loves you and would appreciate knowing what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  All the best-|`|zfhTOfs5aa	yeah you got it right, that's what it is

Believe me I know where your coming from.  It's not you at all.  Your mother chooses to be that way and she is the one at fault, not you.  You not fat either.  Honey don't waste your time stressing over it.  We can't choose who we were made from but we can choose our own moral ethics and family values.  Just remember how she treated you and how it made you feel and promise yourself and honestly stick to it never treat your child/ren that way.  Believe some people were just not meant to be parents.  There is no excuse to justify the behaviour your mother displays towards you.  I don't care if she says its because its her culture because thats a load of crap poor excuse.  Or that was how she was raised either still poor excuse.  No justifies it.  We were all given will power and the choice to choose.  You either choose to be good or you choose to be bad.  You choose to do right or you choose to do wrong.  No one can make anyone act or behave we all choose our own and have to live with the consquences to our choices in life.  Your mother sounds like an emotional abuser.  Don't worry yourself just focus on yourself.  One day you be on your own living your life and enjoying and having a family of your own.  Then just remember to be a better mom then what you had.  You recieve lots of uncondtional love and care from your child/ren.

She will. If she is putting the kids in harms way, you should report it back to the court. As for her not coming to help the kids with homework, they will "talk" to her about it but there isn't much that they will do. Look at it this way, it's her lose, not the kids. They are probably better off without her help.|`|D83bycjRaa	definately take her back to court. But also go with your own personal " diary" of any time she has or the grandparents have had any contact with the kids, sleep overs, when they havent showed etc, wether it's phone calls, visits or whatever adn what happened during that time eg: what was spoken about on the phone/how long and what occured during the visit. I know it sounds so silly but this will make a big difference when you go before the courts.<br>  <br>  Legally the police could intervine straight away when the children are at the grandparents house due to the court orders, they are not to be there.<br>  <br>  If they have already obviously ruled in your favour, then going in again because the conditions arent being meet can only work in your favour.|`|36afb47e932fcc253f891fd79c630e80aa	If she breaks the order then you should contact your lawyer and have the custody order to change to at your disgression.  I dont know if i spelled that right but anyways what it means is that if she is not obeying be the rules set forth then you have the right to refuse her visitation.  Especially if you believe there is drugs present.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	I would like to answer your question, but the lack of punctuation and no clear point is making it very hard for me to understand what you're saying.

OK?|`|AA10949447	you need to be calling the judge or find out who to tell.You need to be doing this now so it can be documented.If you act now I'm sure you will be able to keep your kids.

Of course he doesn't want to still see you! Why the hell do you think he is always doing anything to avoid any type of affection - wake up and smell the coffee - would you like him to treat you this way? I think not stop behaving like a spoilt child.|`|GelbRB8qaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news but it sounds like he has in fact fallen out of love.  <br>  <br>  But... there is hope if you are still in love.  You've got to set him free / part from each other.  If he comes back, it means he regrets what he has done and you should forgive him (once) for being "stupid." <br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you.|`|AA11140814	sounds like he checked out and is too lazy to move or deal with you yelling at him or arguing over why you didn't just talk to him sooner about it. if the situation is that bad, leave now.|`|vbaEt7XYaa	I think that he has indeed fallen out of love witcha... sorry, even if he didnt that dic l< shouldnt say stuff like that to you... its mean|`|9bz6EpoLaa	HE DOESN'T LOVE U.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Work can keep you busy.<br>  Sometimes it takes a while to settle in a routine, get your place - before you can focus on new things like a relation in combination with a job.<br>  <br>  Giving the current situation - work is very important to keep.<br>  So, give it time - and be patient.<br>  <br>  If it is still the same in about 2 months - then she apparently does no longer care about you - and you should consider moving on.<br>  <br>  Take the time to learn some English, because, well, this was pretty hard deciphering.

Time does help but you sound now like you yourself are ready to move on from the place you are in just now, which i imagine is quite unpleasant. I would start with thinking about yourself just now.

Come on, seriously, i know that boy, and a few months ago he was trying to get you back! he can't just hate you like that. Just talk to him if you can. If he really doesn't want to get back with you, then shrug it off and just think there are plenty of other fishies in the sea waiting to be caught. If all else fails, go out on the pull, i'll come with you, i just wont pull lol <br>  <br>  Seriously, he doesn't even have relationships more than a couple of weeks before he dumps them. thats what I'm told anyways. <br>  <br>  Good luck chick x x<br>  :)|`|ZWfztGfXaa	you need to get a rebound guy

Some people wear them, some don't.  It's up to each couple.  The only thing that would be important, is if either spouse removed their ring when they were out alone.  To me, that would be a major danger signal.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	no....up to each individual...and each couple.....I dont wear one though cause it doesnt fit anymore.....fine in the morning....but by the afternoons  I cant get it off and it hurts  : )|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	No.<br>  <br>  I know I'm married.

If I'm not at work I generally wear it.<br>  My husband is a mechanic - he is elbow deep in grease all day, plus welding, and god knows what else - so he doesn't wear his to work either. <br>  <br>  It's not about the little band - it's about what's in your heart.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	Depends on the reason why you don't want to wear the ring:<br>  <br>  If it's because of safety or you are doing something that can damage your ring - then it's fine not to wear it.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to wear it to conceal the fact that you are married - then you should.|`|dJoE8yedaa	It's ideal to, but it depends on the individual. The rings are a reminder of when you made the vows and what the vows mean.|`|W0KQTXrvaa	no i don't wear it all the time and neither does my husband it's not like a ring is marriage, love respect and honesty is|`|0v55bQT1aa	I never did although my hubby does.

4865uWgkaa	You could praise them for doing it. Certain people will get pissed off and stop doing it right away. I've seen it before.<br>  <br>  But honestly, as a teenager myself...I don't think there's actually a way to stop that.<br>  Some people are raised not to tell lies.<br>  Some people lie because they don't trust that person...or they don't think that person can handle the truth.<br>  But some are just naughty enough to tell all the lies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe I'm not helping at all but we live and learn from everything that we did. You want them to stop? They will stop. Time is the only problem like when?|`|MySNBiDRaa	treat them like adults!!! I know they are immature, but if you give them responsibility and share what it is like being an adult, they will act like one. I know this because thats how my relationship with my parents are, and i never lied to them once.<br>  <br>  Didnt always say everyhing, but never lied or tried to cover up something. And they always respected that|`|ZIriZYDwaa	As a teenager I lied constantly to my parents because they were very strict and it was the only way to get out.  Now obviously I feel terrible for all the lies I told and have two teenagers and  I have tried to bring them up so differently to the way I was brought up.<br>  <br>  I let them go out but do have to be in at a certain time.  Its hard bringing up teenagers there is no help and its a thankless task.   They normally lie to get themselves out of trouble or to get what they want.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|l8yXj7uWaa	treat them how you would want to be treated.<br>  <br>  if you want them to tell the truth then make sure your firm but not to firm because that can scare them to lie because they dont know whats going to happen.<br>  <br>  also if you dont want them to lie then make sure you always tell the truth, because if they see you lieing then they seeem to think its alright because there parents do it!<br>  <br>  dont shout or point fingers because when my parents do that it gets me all angry and i end up shouting back and then basically your getting no where.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :)|`|CTAg1Ugdaa	I am a teenager. Coming from my own personal experience, i think that teenagers lie because theyre scared of the outcome. Are you a parent of this teen? If so, truly talk to him/her.. tell them how you feel. Be honest. Care, love and support them. Let them know that too. Trust me, it works :)
Tw6pF30aaa	What is the best thing to do....and you still love/desire to have him there with you? <br>  <br>  First, is your mother-in-law wheel chair bound? Can she walk by herself?  If this is the case, your husband may be really not able to leave his mother alone, for fear that he may be abandoning her. If this is the case, do some research, and see what type of social services the county and city she lives in may be available to her.  Secondly, ask him point blank, if he wants to get a divorce.  However, if these are not  the case........read on. <br>  <br>  You sound very intelligent, as a person who is willing to take charge of your life, instead of allowing others to take charge of your life, and ruin it for you.  You moved out on your own, and this is a very wise,  and good choice you have made on your own, and a very good move.  Your husband did not follow you, because he has made  a bad choice not to do so. He may even be using his own mother's "fake" illness as an easy excuse to have his own way with you, and his mother, who has also made a bad choice in enabling her son to be irresponsible in his marriage, and thus irresponsible in life.  <br>  <br>  There is really nothing else you can do, except get counseling only for yourself to move on with your life at this time right now, and fill it with new hobbies that will fulfill that desire you have for him in other ways, and activities.  The best thing you can do, is to do "you"!   Take an "hip hop" dance/exercise class, or play  some power girl songs like " I will survive", by Gloria Gaynor, "To the left", by Beyonce, "Girlfriend" by Pebbles, He wasn't man enough for me" by Toni Braxton, and any other song that will lift you up emotionally.  Get a new hair style just for you, and no other person. Believe and know that you are all of that, and he cannot see this for the emotionally blinders he wears that have nothing to do with the real vision of who you are.  <br>  <br>  As long as you begged him, you give him the power, and his mother.  Stop asking him to come live with you, because believe me, he knows where, and to whom he should be living with at night. When he comes to where you are on his own, be the strong woman that you have proven yourself to be.  Find out what kind of visit is it this time, and do what ever you feel you should do, but keep your dignity, and do not let him get you out of the "good place" you want to be in for your self.  His problems he is making for his self, are really his, and not your own.  <br>  <br>  Regarding his mother.....you cannot compete with the type of bond that your husband and her have.  It's a bond that is unique of any other bond in relationships, but it seem as though it is an “unbalanced” for what ever reason.  The bond that you and your husband do not have at this point in your relationship is a very weak one, and in the world of chemistry....when one atom refuses to bond with the other atom, what bond is it?  However, if it is at all possible that the strong  atom (you) can draw the weak atom (him) to it, it will bond, but only if it fuses.  See if he is willing on his own (without you calling him, begging him, or asking him to stay over.  Be strong for yourself, because he is the weak one at this point in his life.  If he starts staying with your over the night where a husband who loves, and cares for his wife should be, or is drawn in by your "new attitude"…..that good....right? But if he does not, time will transition all things good for you.  Keep on keeping on doing good things for yourself, and if you have children, if at possible enroll them in some activities too.  Be the best mom, you can be (if you are a mom).  When they see mom happy, they are happy (if this is the case in your situation).   Prepare yourself not to let him see that "understandable needy" part of you that every wife naturally have for their husband, and vice versa, if he chooses, or you allowed him to spend the night.  He knows that you want him there, as I said before, he knows where he should be. Remember, you are intelligent, wise, and make good choices, and he cannot see you as your are at this point in his life, because he cannot even see, that what he is doing is irresponsible as a husband, and a man at this point in his life as well.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself, because your husband is taking care of another woman (his mother), and she is taking care of him for what ever reason it serves them both in the bond they have, at this point in "their" time, and there is really nothing that you can do. That bond was set way before he met you, that does not nullify who you are as a wise, and strong woman who knows how to make good choices for yourself.  Remember, if you get counseling, get it only to make yourself more wiser and stronger.|`|SckWdjnVaa	If u love ur hubby, u shud respect his sentiments & support him....rather than but him in constant strain!!! <br>  <br>  By moving out, u proved that u aint the types who wud fight & win the situation...but a loser, who wud rather run away when faced with a difficulty!!!

If you want a divorce there is nothing he can really do about it, he can try to make it take longer but that is about it. Sit him down and tell him that you know she is a faker and you won't stand for being second in his life, see what he says and go from there.

trXjBRlRaa	Because he doesn't want to be caught cheating on you. His and her behavior are both inappropriate. Once you are in a serious relationship you tend to let go of having the type of relationship he is with another person of the opposite sex. Meaning - I have friends that are male, but I would never go dancing with them. Probably not even go out to dinner with them (actually, I wouldn't go out to dinner with them). Why? There is an element of opportunity for misunderstanding on everyone's part. <br>  <br>  Also, look at his keeping this a "secret". Secret's are bad and surprises are good. A secret means something is happening that shouldn't be and he is not trustworthy enough to come clean.<br>  <br>  I would look long and hard, make him look long and hard, at where he really wants to be. And what this girl is really all about. You have the answer in the palm in your hands, but it is hard to accept. I am sorry.|`|AA11108018	He is doing all that you said but is worried that you might find out you all ready know what he is doing what's to find out.  That girl is just someone looking for quick ride in the hay|`|ksZfTHyQaa	She might be trying to flirt with him to get back at you for taking her boyfriend from her like she claims. Kind of like seeking revenge by trying to take your boyfriend now. He might be worried about you finding out because he feels guilty that he flirts with her or dances with her because he's interested in her. If he has every chance to go with her but chooses to stay with you it means he loves you. Now the fact that he flirts and worries you'll find out is something you need to talk to him about. He may or may not be cheating, or thinking about it, but it's better that you two talk about it and get things out in the open because only he really knows why he does this. We can all assume things based on what you have said but guys have different motives so you won't really know unless you ask him or you find out more things because after all, he can always lie about it. I'd just be cautious and very observant because if he worries about you finding out, then he might be doing something he knows is wrong.|`|U4ek1lCLaa	your the good girl, she''s the bad girl. He probably wants to keep you but also wants to have his fun, be careful because if the other girl can she will have sex with him, it's a game and she wants to throw it in your face she can control your man and when she is done will throw him back at you. Girls can be evil and she seems to be.|`|BLFduvnpaa	she's a childish brat who is living a miserable life right now because she insists on bearing a grudge over something that happened a long time ago.<br>  <br>  i personally don't think you should be worried cause your partner may just be doing some harmless flirting.|`|NvbTnLrBaa	I agree 100% with Beth K. if hes flirting with a girl that is a threat  then maybe hes not so trust worthy. If my husband was doing that.... he'd be out of my home so fast. I'd tell him to stay at her house, if he likes her that much.|`|s3gs4JLAaa	well, just find other guy ok, he is not worthed|`|Q13UIQGyaa	you have already found out what he is doing i guess.<br>  <br>  anyway it means he is not sure about this girl. he is staying with you because he has everything he needs with you. if he didn't still need you then he'd have gone.|`|vbaEt7XYaa	well because he knows(or assumes) u will cut off his testicals.. **which u shoud** im not such a jealous person, but if my girlfriend was kickin it with some dude, n dancing... I would dance rite out the door

As he also loves u, he ll know tat u r adjusting nd compromising..so a day ll come where u ll find him supporting u instead..<br>  So all the best..

If it really does not matter let it go, and if your marriage is so important then be the first to say sorry, listen  don't talk when your partner is mad and really try to understand them.  If he loves you he will see the change and respond in a similar manner.  Don't let pride and the need to get your opinion across ruin a good thing.|`|71VRvldJaa	Star signs have nothing to do with it!<br>  It sounds like you're both right fighters!......it takes 2 people to argue/quarrel and you both want to win!  How many of those arguments are really important issues?.....worth getting angry about.....worth getting upset about?  You can't argue by yourself!  Just don't argue back!|`|Ea6TnOuOaa	I can very well understand your state because I am also sailing in the same boat.  My wife and I are diametrically two poles apart but still we can not live without each other.  At innumerable times we have had decided to part ways but when it comes pass, we both get cold feet and we hug each other with a tacit promise to one another that we would never take such step.  But no sooner do we turn the corner, we are back into quarreling mode.  Our quarrels again hot up to a boiling point and we again end up making up minds to part but it will ever happen until hell freezes over.  What to do, this is what chemistry we share.  We can neither live together nor can live without each-other. So this is how cookie crumbles and perhaps this is how we both are destined to live and love each other.  Rather than giving you any tip, I have just presented to you my own example if it helps you take a leaf from my book.
djUMvICoaa	It has nothing to do about forcing you, we can't do that.  The only thing we can do is give you advice on what we see and what we think is best for you.  If we see a problem we feel obligated to tell you about that problem.   The rest is up to you.  What I see is you being the same as a stalker right now, trying to hunt somebody down and not on their free will.  When I see that I see trouble and it can easily become that.  All she has to do is make a call to the cops that you won't let her alone and then you've got them to contend with.  You don't have to think about that but it is  in your best interest to.|`|kgHBKcbAaa	Listen If a girl told you that she don't love you then why should you humiliate you self you bringing the problems to yourself. your better off with someone that loves you than someone that doesn't .
ZrS4I4lNaa	Yeah definitely get rid sweetie......I've been there and decided to stay with the cheat and regretting it now.<br>  <br>  He lied to me for about 6months and turned it all on me, in the end i found the evidence and he had no choice but to own up. My gut feeling the whole time was saying he had and turns out it was right all along.<br>  <br>  You need to follow your gut instincts, if you think he has he more than likely has and if he hasn't then he's a complete **** for not reassuring you! =)|`|An2GISZYaa	he obviously did do something with her or likes her because if he didnt he would be assuring you he isnt . move on , you can find someone that deserves you !|`|AA11108018	If you could controlled so easy trying to please him.  It is a sign that you should be done the him.  It would be much better if you found someone to date,and  love you and who was not insecure as he is.  You could have a meaningful relationship   Good luck|`|WY8IeHapaa	150% right. <br>  <br>  he treated you like a prisoner and if he can't take a taste of his on medicine, he is welcome to walk out.<br>  <br>  which person who loves you will say such hurtful things to you anyway? very emotionally imbalanced if you ask me and it might take a toll on you. if he wants to be alone, let him be.<br>  <br>  and pleeaaaaassee move on before this gets violent|`|IPS3hWweaa	You are right. That guy sounds like a total whacko. Be glad that its over because I don't think you'd ever really be happy being with that guy.|`|AA10776535	You two do not belong together its best to move on.
JhvqUvlsaa	Is he willing to do anything for you? Is he treating you like a queen and every little thing you do is perfect? Do his eyes show tenderness and kindness, and he never takes them off you? Does he hug you for no reason? Give you a gift for no reason? Does he offer to help you with any little project or offer to be helpful when you go through difficulties? Does he come to your rescue? Does he see a beautiful dress, earrings, or other expensive attire and tell you you would look great in it?<br>  <br>  These are signs that he loves you as well. Look for clues and drop hints to him that you love him and see how he reacts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
j0mI8l07aa	Honestly there is no easy way. And it's gonna hurt him no matter what. Just be blunt and truthful, and tell him you wish him well and hope he finds someone special. Making up a bunch of stuff or telling him a bunch of cliche' crap is just gonna make him MORE pissed and hurt, not less.|`|u2lYbPT2aa	You tell him the truth!!<br>  Just tell him that you think it would be much better, if you were friends!!<br>  Let him know, that you really don't want to hurt his feelings, and that it is not because you want someone else, but that you feel like you would rather be good friends!!<br>  Good luck to you!!  Love, Agoodgirl_msjXOXO|`|OgHmNwV6aa	I always try to say that he is too good for me and I do not deserve him. But it never works because they start saying that they are not that good after all...<br>  <br>  I suppose the best way is to be honest. If you do not love him anymore say so; with time he will understand that if there is no love there is no reason for a relationship.|`|ksZfTHyQaa	There is no easy way because if he really, really likes you then his feelings will be hurt regardless of how nicely you break up with him. Just try to be honest because it sounds like you really are concerned with his feelings.

If he asks questions dont get angry just answer them truthfully to him, he will appreciate you more for this.|`|DTFiVNn5aa	State ur original truthful reason,no lies.just say it to him nicely,like ask him 2 go out for a drink n tell him abt wat u think abt him really.be nice.dont be harsh.well just try n make him think positive and make him stay happy.good luck<3|`|AA12077420	No matter how hard you try,you'll still end up hurting him.|`|HeSCyy7paa	there is no easy way<br>  <br>  tell him you're a guy lol<br>  <br>  although that might hurt your reputation|`|WY8IeHapaa	just let him no the truth. prepare to see him angry and hurt though
dJoE8yedaa	Have you tried believing her? Women rarely cheat, but if u keep accusing her she just might end up doing it and not with the stupid gay pilot. I have a jealous husband and it seriously does my head in. If he could just trust me, i feel he'd be more trustworthy and would never cheat or give him reason to think i cheat.<br>  Do you realise how much she trusts you? She leaves you home and it's more possible for you to cheat as you know her days away. So if she can trust you, why can't you trust her in return. The day she starts accusing you is the day you should worry, seriously.|`|AA11777322	If you are married to  your wife, why does it matter what someone else tells you.  You are married to your wife and you are supposed to trust what your wife tells you.  Why are you calling people asking them questions about your wife behind her back.  You are acting like you are 12 years old.  If you loved her enough to marry her and she is out working don't keep confusion going on her job.  You need to work on your issues of being jealous.  And hope that she doesn't leave  you for acting like a jealous idiot.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I say you need to try to leave this alone for now. if you left your wife. in a yr. when the dust settles and you find another woman. I bet that other woman is with a man tonight. I would try to slowly put money back in another account for a lawyer if theres another account of this. the bible says you become what you run with.I would ask your wife to please cut all ties with that tramp she hangs out with. if she values your relationship and kids she should.I would also seek counseling if the jealousy issues don't settle down. the children need a sturdy home. you have to tell her is she was needing a kidney to stay alive you would give her one. she needs to give up that tramp of a friend to keep your marriage alive. buy her something nice with a card and flowers. tell her your sorry but you need her to stop hanging out with her. tell her you love her and don't want the strain of her friend in the way of your insecurity's. tell her she can blame it all on you to her friend. you are justing looking out for your family. tell her you really don't want to put the children through a broken home.you want to give them a good loving home.tell her if her friend had not have been the type to cheat around on her mate you probably wouldn't have thought like you did.|`|zAoKd2DBaa	22 year old screwed up lying cheating pilot.  i don't wanna fly on his plane. <br>  <br>  who the hell knows they all sound like lunatics to me.

It also shows he more of a gentlemen by wanting to tell his ex and their family how sorry he is.  Why don't you go with him if you're feeling that insecure?|`|VQYsHocKaa	well it sounds like your slightly jelous but that isnt  aproblem, i get jelous with situations including my boyfriend too, its ok for him to go to the funeral as maybe he knew this person well when he was with his ex and wants to support the family, however its a bit harsh that he told u he doesnt talk to her anymore and all of a sudden hes going to the funeral, speak to your boyfriend about it and just ask him to tell you truthfully if he has actually been talkin  to his ex. Dont show your boyfriend that you are upset thought, try to forget about the funeral.|`|73e1265991767c4d53c4fa95c30f49e6aa	I don't think it's a bad thing. If he knew this person then he wants closer and it has nothing to do with you. Maybe he is just going to support the family. You can only go to a funeral once.

Let it go and stop being so controlling.|`|jZikbLE3aa	he probably likes her if so i feel sorry for u|`|TG5DW7DQaa	I would feel a little pissed about it too, but maybe he was close to the grandad? <br>  It is a hard situation, but if you think of it, it is just a funeral.<br>  He wants to pay his respects, as long as you trust him and have no other issues with him and the ex, or other girls then i dont see a big problem.|`|0SsRoo2Iaa	she probally asked for his support<br>  or maybe he has been talking to her and hasnt told you<br>  (n)|`|MVOwK7ueaa	You shouldn't =\
5KJHuhHZaa	Congrats :D<br>  <br>  I was away tring to find my dream dress last weekend and the dresses i tried on ranged from ￡1100 - ￡1800 but you dont have to spend that much just depends on your budget and what you want!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck xx|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I paid AU$2300 (1050 pounds) for my dress.  This is $1000 off the retail price of this dress, so it was expensive, but I was still happy. It is Rima by Pronovias. <br>  <br>  You can find many dresses much cheaper. With the pound to US$ exchange rate you might get a bargain on a foreign site like:<br>  www.bestbridalprices.com<br>  www.tjformal.com<br>  www.jaysbridal.com|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Well I already had a budget set and I said this is the max amount I will spend on my dress. I first budget I set was 700 then I took it down to 500 because I thought 700 was a lot for a dress I would only wear for a day. I spent 500 on my dress no more. It was the perfect dress for me and I couldn't have asked for anything more. You should have ideas of something you want but take into consideration ideas from the consultant they have great ideas. Good luck.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I am in the US and the dresses I looked at, and actually liked, in the salons ranged from $450 to $900 US Dollars before alteration charges.<br>  I ended up ordering off of eBay and getting mine for $219 including shipping.|`|uec7RIhbaa	￡850 for mine.  you can expect anything from ￡200 - ￡2000, depending on the type of shop/dress/make etc.  in normal, high-street bridal shops most will be from ￡500 - ￡900 i found.|`|MG8MwZrIaa	I went to a sample sale and found my dream dress for $700 CAD!

It's what you like and how it looks. I only paid 200.00 for my wedding dress and it looked like I paid 1000.00. I turned around and sold it for 200.00 later. This was in 1994 but you need to shop around and look on line too. It can be a bit risking to order in the mail but if you do it early enough you can send it back and get the right size.|`|r2yl4Vqdaa	Congratulations!<br>  In the UK, you can expect to pay ￡400-￡2000 for a dress in a salon, and then you will have to add to it the costs of alterations. Dresses in the US and Canada are usually $500-$2000. Shopping online or buying a used dress can save you a lot of money. <br>  You can also have your dress custom made in China for ￡150-￡250 from this website: <a href="http://www.myweddingdressforless.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.myweddingdressforless.co.uk</a> and if you take good measurements, you won't have to have any alterations as it will be made exactly to your size. The company that makes the dresses in China, Milly Bridal, gets nothing but rave reviews from anyone who used their services (just google them and see).|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	ooh you lucky girl I bought my dress from the UK and I am having it shipped to the US and it was about $300.00 US funds here is the website<br>   <a href="http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/ind...</a><br>  and I got this one <br>  <a href="http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/apps/webstore/products/show/267834" rel="nofollow">http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/app...</a><br>  But since I wanted to be different I got it in burgundy and black flowers can't wait to get it!

This might sound like a lot for a dress but I don't care. It is my one day where I can spoil myself and be over-extravagant, and the dress is beautiful. Absolutely stunning and unusual. You can get some lovely dresses for ￡400-￡600 mark though.|`|nbUpqg04aa	the price of the dress is somewhat  irrelevant, you will just know when you have found "the one" i promise!|`|d0ad66ad96487e877452e236ad2bd4f2aa	i thought my dress was a bargain at ￡500 but didn't factor in alterations which took an extra 3 weeks and cost me ￡200 on top!  Then there was the petticoat at ￡75, tiara at ￡25, bolero at ￡55, jewellery at ￡40, shoes at ￡55. my final total was ￡950!<br>  <br>  I wish that i had used this company: <a href="http://www.mascherabridal.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.mascherabridal.co.uk</a> my friend used. her gown was amazing and was custom made to her measurements so it didn't need altering.

Even if it is to think of her, you don't love her enough to care to wait for her to get you off.  You lust for her much, yes, because you may even fantasize about her in doing it making you think you are still being loyal if you think of her, but if you can't wait, you don't love her enough.  If you don't get it, it means your heart is even more closed and that you cannot understand what love is, although you might beg to differ with your pride getting in the way.|`|ADY7U1yQaa	yea but dont tell your girl.  she will come out with " why are you doing that? am i not good enough that you have to masterbate.  is it not good with me? are you bored of our sex..... and so on and on.  dont let her know.|`|hxQmr6IGaa	If you always have amazing sex, why bother masturbating?!

I'm beginning to think that YOU are the one wetting the bed. In any event, be it your husband or your son, they need medical help. Get them both to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Having now read this, my opinion is that you are a most cruel person, thinking only of yourself - Sleep in a different bed than your husband and cancel your son's bar mitzvah. Hopefully they will both then realize that you care about no one but yourself and send you packing!! Believe me, your son will NEVER forgive you and I won't blame him.|`|JbnvItGOaa	I don't get it.  How come everybody in your family wets the bed?  Don't you have an indoor bathroom?  I still wet the bed sometimes.  I am 17 but I have epilepsy and I pee sometimes when I have a seizure in my sleep.  Maybe this is what your family has.  You need to take them all to see a doctor.|`|KOfxqaApaa	Wow, you've got a whole family of bed wetters. Sucks to be you.|`|4d8f32baf317fdbfc174628a3a492ba4aa	That is a awful idea. He's not wetting the bed because he wants to and punishing him in any way at all for something he has no control over is pretty harsh. <br>  <br>  He's probably more embarrassed about it than you are. Most kids stop wetting the bed at about five years old or so - if he is still doing it now then there is likely to be a issue, possibly medical or psychological, that he needs help with. <br>  <br>  From the sound of your question it's likely that you have been punishing him for a while for this and, to be honest, this is probably the root cause of why he hasn't stopped. Go see your doctor, who will tell you it's very important not to punish the your son or make him worried about the bed-wetting, and will be able to suggest some practical solutions to help both of you solve this.<br>  <br>  I can't stress enough how important it is that you don't make him feel bad about this - this is probably why this is still going on. <br>  <br>  Have a little sympathy for your kid - he's only thirteen and probably hates himself for this. Making him think you hate him too and that he's "not a man" is desperately unfair.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Have you taken him to a doctor about the bedwetting? I am serious. If he is wetting the bed, he has a medical condition and needs help from a medical professional.<br>  <br>  I think that cancelling the celebration as a punishment is extraordinarily cruel. How will he explain it to his friends and classmates? Or do you care?<br>  <br>  You know, if his bedwetting turns out to be psychological, I bet you are the cause.|`|AA10776535	You may want to take the boy to the doctors.|`|W762b31aaa	You need to take your son to the doctor's and have his bladder checked.  This could be a medical problem and canceling his celebration is not the answer.  You should not be embarrassed by your son's problems, you should be concerned that he doesn't have a health issue that could be making him have this problem in the first place.  Good luck and Bless you.|`|KR3AYA7faa	<sigh> No one wants to hear this but it's clear that you are a failure as a wife and mother. First your husband and now your son? It's a disgrace to your community and cannot be forgiven. Your temple should shun you. The only honorable solution is seppuku. Good Luck!|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Your reaction to your son's bed wetting seems to be based on what you feel, not what your son feels.  It seems he could have either a medical problem, or a physiological one.  Either way, he needs help, not punishment, and your suggestion is absolutely cruel.|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	stop posting the same question over and over!!!!!!!! its annoying- you've got your reaction now! bit sad and pathetic if you ask me

XuUMXQ8Naa	I think that answer depends on the morality of the son.<br>  If they are dependent on the son for money and he stops sending them money what will happen to the parents: will they starve?<br>  Is there is no state pension  to help the parents, can they liquidate some of their assets i.e. move to a smaller house?<br>  Also, is the dad in good health? can he find a  part-time job or start one up such as odd job man or gardening.<br>  lots of shops here are actively hunting for older employees as they say they are more reliable than the teenagers (no comment).<br>  The christian relatives should actually help people in need whether they agree with the son or not, its part of being christian to help those less fortunate, esp. if they're there  own relatives.<br>  Do they really know how bad the situation is? Has the situation really been discussed properly?<br>  I've offered rooms to my old relatives if they ever can't look after themselves, I hope they dont ever take it up but you can't stand by and watch people suffer.<br>  Finally, would the son seriously marry a girl who would happily watch his parents become destitute: if she was nice and kind I think she would try and help out too.|`|CBafFVoxaa	What would happen to them without his help? Would they starve be homeless? He needs to examine his heart first of all. Sounds like he may be angry that they need his help even though they were probably not angry that they had to raise him for 18 years. I know from my own personal experience that if is painful for a parent to need the help of their children. At this time I do not know what my husband and I would do without the support of our children. both financially and emotionally. We dont like that we have to have their help but it is just a sad fact of life with the current economic status it is really hard for people to make it on their own. Other than that he can research the social services that he can get them some assistance. Best of luck to him and always remember how your parents stood by your side when you were young. It was a struggle for them as well.
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	Ok first of all , DO NOT AGREE TO ANYTHING with out discussing it with the lawyer.. because for one.. depending on what state u live in, i know in Florida.. for 2 children at 80,000 a year.. it would be over 1200.00 a month in c/s ..BUT keep in mind if he gets JOINT custody usually c/s is a wash because its 50/50 time.. if your can prove the abuse.. that you claim ur husband has put u and your children through over the years u can probably keep him from having joint custody.. but it has to be more then your word vs his.. , how old are your kids? if your kids are 12 or older they are old enough to tell the judge where they want to be and why.. they can do this in a closed room with out their father or u present.. as far as the disabled brother.. u can have it put in the papers that the children arent to stay overnight in the same home as the disabled brother because of past history.. .. <br>  <br>     Definately see a lawyer, definately explain all situations your concerned with and find out what steps to take.. etc.. <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|zka26204aa	Consult an attorney before you accept that.

Do you really want him to have half custody of your children knowing he abuses them? No amount of money could ever get rid of his past abuse, or that of his brother<br>  <br>  If there is a history of abuse, there is no way any judge would grant him custody, except through supervised visits. Get a good lawyer and fight for custody of your children. And don't worry about child support - he'll have to pay it anyway based on his income. And if he tries to refuse, it will automatically be garnered from his paychecks.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay strong.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	You are out of the relationship, yet he is still using his stand over tactics and trying to show you that he is the one with the power and the knowledge.

I would seek advise from your lawyer, especially with it being your children, and his brother. I wouldn't take any chances, none, zero, nada. Is it joint custody, or Joint guardianship? Custody is the bigger of the two. If I were you, I would fight it tooth and nail and not allow it to happen. Allow him time/access when he wants, and get your child support, but leave it at that. Get advise soon. Best of luck.

LoB3g56waa	Yeah. And if they're the type of girl that's very flirtatious or that's in love with you too, try getting close to them like for example, in a class, then when her hand is somewhere no one can see it try touching it with your pinky, and then from there, if she's ok with it, she should look at you and react, or you should see her facial expression change to more something happy. From there on you can go to holding her and and now class isn't half has boring. <br>  <br>  If you can do what I told you, try rubbing your thumb SLOWLY up and down in her hand.

Sometimes friends will play mean jokes like this, or if he did dump you there was a miscommunication about what was really going on. Find your boyfriend and talk to him yourself.

RLoilwCNaa	Marriage takes a lot of work. There are going to be times when you don't like each other. This is very normal. Sometimes you might hate each other. Communication is important as is compromise. Things won't always be great. Fight through those times and don't give up.

d0WQ2pZNaa	kiss him like you usually kiss people. When its someone's first kiss they want it to be comfortable(i know i did), and you have experience can even make that a lot easier if you just relax yourself, and just do what you normally do.<br>  If you want to do more than just kissing, while your at it (making out im guessing) slowly move your hands else where, he'll soon get the picture, and he'll tell you whether or not hes up for it, or if youre moving to fast for him, etc.<br>  <br>  Chill out, and it will be much less awkward for the both of you!!|`|aoftBP7eaa	well teach him<br>  theres nothing wrong with that<br>  or just take it slow let me get comfortable|`|KLFVEUtGaa	If you truly like him, then you shouldn't really be worried about it... just kiss him, and when you do, since you have to experience behind you, it will make it easier for him.

Have fun!|`|wilZqg7Laa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I believe that first kiss should always be done while the two of you are alone. This will help to avoid any unnecessary nervousness and embarrassing situations.<br>  <br>  The best type of kiss is one that uses different variations...<br>  such as starting with a small kiss, working into a French Kiss, maybe sucking on your partner's upper or lower lip...<br>  <br>  And don't just leave kisses to the lips.<br>  Kiss their cheeks, their chin or their eyelids.<br>  This can be very seductive and romantic.|`|dON74uCraa	don't you remember how your first kiss was? it might be a bit awkward, but it's special. be glad that he's choosing you :) he might be a really good kisser, it might just come naturally, who knows? you sound pretty young, i doubt you have a 'decent amount of experience', so you probably won't freak him out. just go with the flow, and communication is important. :)|`|za9b8cHKaa	Start off slowly with a few gentle pecks and work from there ...|`|5agXk9ldaa	well yea why not!!!!|`|AA11493831	It can be awkward. But if you're really open with each other, I don't see any problem. If you feel comfortable with each other, but if you don't want him to have the impression that you've kissed a lot of guys or creeping him out, you can try this approach. My friends often times use it. <br>  <br>  You can ask him to watch some movies that have detailed kissing scenes with you. And tell him that you too, lack some experience in kissing. Explain to him that by watching some movies you can have some pointers and practice it with each other. That'll be fun and at the same time he'll be able to become a good kisser in time.|`|YQ1Jhgcuaa	Here is a funny and informative article on how to decide when to have that first kiss.

TIVrZ2I8aa	You may need to accept the fact that this time in your lives, you are not right for each other.<br>  <br>  I suggest relationship classes together and individually.  I, am going to take some myself.  If you love each other, you will do whatever necessary to better the relationship.<br>  <br>  Maybe some time apart will help the relationship.  Meet new people (not for intimate relationships, that would ruin any progress you two make).  Get more involved in hobbies/other activities.  Keep yourself busy.  Don't forget to keep in touch with your SO.  Let her know you still care/love her.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard!!  Talk to her about giving it a shot for another couple months and if that doesn't work, you should end the relationship.  Drop all contact with her.  You will "mourn" for the loss of the relationship for some time BUT both of you will be better in the end.  Learn from each other to make the next gf an even better experience.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|s9sN9m3qaa	It depends on how seriously you are contemplating leaving her.<br>  <br>  In every relationship, thoughts may come of leaving that person. Things they do might bug you, they're immature, they do stupid things, etc, etc.<br>  Yet if you love them.. You stay. You give them time to work things out. You  accept there qualities.<br>  <br>  Relationships require a HUGE amount of work.  If you truly love her, you should give her time to work this out.  If she loves you, she will stop hurting you.  But don't forget that it will take time and extreme effort, on both your parts.<br>  <br>  If you think there is a chance you might regret leaving her.. DON'T.<br>  You don't want to look back and regret it.  Then you will forever ask, "what if?"<br>  <br>  Over time, if you feel the hurt is too much and she will never change you may have to go.<br>  You will cry. You will hurt.

AA11930502	Personally I think a wink means many things such as, hello, thankyou, good job,excuse me, or "your cute". I used to have the habit of using the wink in that manner until I got a jealous boyfriend and it caused problems. So you have to be careful of the message sent if you wink, but I still think its a cute jester and not meant only for aflirt. People always like to think the worst. It depends on the man winking at you, I have a feeling he's just saying hello in a peronable manner.|`|AA12183008	Well could be either, but I'd say he just likes you as a person, and leave it at that.

Keep yourself occupied & try not to think of her. What I did was think of the negative things bout him. I think that it may have helped too but not sure. Avoid going to places where you might run in to her or where you 2 used to go. Hang out w/ your friends. Do something that's gonna make you a better person. Ex. hanging out w/ friends (not feeling as lonely or sad) or going to the gym (a good work out will make you sweat, plus it'll put you in good shape for new girls who you may find yourself interested in when you're ready to date ;) Good luck !!!

6f78be0146961394fed53b1377e884e5aa	True love is when you want your boyfriend to have what HE wants MORE than you want him to have what YOU want him to have.  The myth that we usually call being "in love" is just that, it's not at all what we think it is.  That fake love, while feeling VERY intense and very real is just our human animal instincts taking over and making us feel strongly attracted to a member of the opposite sex who we believe would make a good physical partner for us.  It's nature's way of ensuring the survival of our species.  Here's an easy way to tell the difference between the two.  If you are feeling "crazy" about him, if you can't sleep/work/eat or hang out with your friends without constantly thinking about him, if you're feeling all dreamy and very "Romeo and Juliet" about him, if you're wondering where he is and who he's with when he's not with you, if you want him all to yourself, THAT is your DNA talking and that feeling will vanish after you have been with him for a little while.  That feeling is the myth.  If on the otherhand, you really want him to have whatever it is he wants.  If you just want him to be happy.  It doesn't mean you have to give him everything he wants, it just means you want him to have it if he wants it (for example, if you don't want to have sex, but he does, if you love him you'd want him to be able to have sex with someone, just not you).  That may, on the surface, sound silly, but if you think about it, it's true.  Fake love is selfish and all about what you are getting out of the relationship.  Real love is about giving and helping someone get what they want...as long as their having it doesn't cause you to lose who you really are, or to do something that goes against who you really are.   Good luck.|`|002bd96868f6b127800f96876595af72aa	You will love him romantically, you will see him as your best friend and you will want to share your life with him living in a way that is based on giving, on concern and care for him, rather than on getting your way and pleasing  yourself.|`|21e8f99c5e93d7949965e8dd6939d110aa	u probably are in love with your bf|`|AA11538697	Love is more that a emotional feeling it is built over time you must be in a relationship for a while before you know its love. You will find out how much you love someone when there is hardship.

You can't wait until things start getting bad to begin putting extra effort into the relationship.  Send flowers, cards, etc just to say I love you.  Make as much time as possible to be together and when planning weekends or whatever time you may be able to see each other, make sure that you are spending enough time doing normal relationship things, not just spending the entire time holed up in the house.

AA11632370	Hello!<br>  Thanks for the additional info. I think this would help a lot as Dr. Faiz's chamber in LabAid Green Road is near to our place. I am sorry that I could not make any real progress so far and hope that some news can be found soon about Dr. M. Robed Amin. Keep well.<br>  Hafiz<br>  <br>  By the way, your e-mail is not getting through Y!A in my first attempt. I do not know if this time it would succeed... (No the second attempt also is not getting through. Pls provide your e-mail or IM, if you like)<br>  <br>  Oops<br>  Your email did not go through because the recipient\ (ronita)'s email address has not been confirmed. <br>  Back to Home  <br>  My Q&A<br>  <br>  <br>  From: ronita<br>  <br>  Subject: Information about Dr. M. Robed Amin<br>  <br>  Message: Thank you so much for your concern & efforts. It feels great to find people responding to others need & I think YahooAnswers is a great way doing it.<br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure about Dr. MRA's MBBS passing year. It can be 1992, 1993 or 1994. But one thing I know for sure, he had been a very popular guy in the campus. He worked as CA in CMCH in Medicine Unit III from around1999-2001. By the way, his hometown is in Chittagong. He used to live in Chittagong town with his parents. I have heard that he has come to DMCH. He may have close connection with Dr. M. A. Faiz, Head of the Medicine department of DMCH. Dr. Faiz's chamber is in Labaid, but Dr. Robed is not there. <br>  <br>  I do wish I could find him. <br>  <br>  Thanks again. <br>  Ronita|`|09e7abe08ce00bd3e0c4d7e7472c103daa	Good luck with your search!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zabasearch.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.emailaddresses.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emailaddresses.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://in.members.yahoo.com/interests/co...">http://in.members.yahoo.com/interests/co...</a><br>  <a href="http://spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spaces.live.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.anywho.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anywho.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.addresses.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.addresses.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://find.intelious.com/" rel="nofollow">http://find.intelious.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://people.yahoo.com/">http://people.yahoo.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.freeprf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freeprf.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.reunitetonight.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reunitetonight.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://family.public-records.com/.........." rel="nofollow">http://family.public-records.com/..........</a><br>  <a href="http://www.192.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.192.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://in.members.yahoo.com/regional/cou...">http://in.members.yahoo.com/regional/cou...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.b4usearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.b4usearch.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.peoplefinders.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysearch.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.arin.net/whois/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arin.net/whois/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.reunion.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reunion.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/can/www_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/can/www_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.friendsreunited.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.whitepages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitepages.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.classmates.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.classmates.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com</a>

I almost overlooked this new Question as your first Q remains "Open Question" simultaneously. May be this tip would be useful to you for future Q&A situations.<br>  <br>  Now, in view of your furnishing new data here, I contacted my friend over Mobile (who was in OT Room – Oops!) and he informed me that he has passed from Sylhet Medical College way back in 1979. He further told me that he may need some more info like in which year Dr. M. Robed Amin passed his MBBS from Sylhet Medical College? I informed him about Dr. MRA’s having passed FCPS in 2003, but he could not recollect now and mentioned that he will get back to me later… However, I will try to contact DMCH to see if he is available here and get back to you soon.<br>  <br>  By the way, you can contact or send me e-mail at mhafiz.ullah@gmail.com to save on points or you may add Additional Details by clicking the ‘button’ in this question window. You can also click on my Avatar in this page and get to send me e-mail through profile-page link, if you like.<br>  <br>  Please bear with me for a while as we have lot of political agitation going on in Dhaka in these days. It would be my pleasure to find your friend for you.

AA12234358	To be perfectly honest those that desert us after seeing us at our weakest moments don't deserve a second thought.  If you really care for him though, I would say go up to him and tell him that you've thought about it and just wanted him to know what a great friend he was that night you got trashed, let him know you realize it changed things, but that if he ever needs you you're there for him.

She doesn't have to stay with the father just because he's the father.  The baby will still be able to know him.  Does she love the man?  Do you think she has feelings for you?

You seem like a really nice guy, and this girl has a life that she obviously keeps secret from you. I think you would be shocked if you knew what kind of girl she really is. Seriously, right now your relationship with this girl REALLY reminds me of Forrest Gump's relationship with Jenny. I'm not saying that your girl is THAT bad, but you saw how it was. It sounds like what you guys have. I would keep her as a friend but never looks at it as more than that becaues there is probably a good girl out there for you. And trust me, you shouldn't let your desire for her interfere with your pursuit of a more suitable companion.

It's not going to fix the feelings but at least you are on the road to healing ... If you have anger then it's time to accept it's finished and your anger is not going to change a thing.

xzcsQ1PXaa	My advice... don't worry about it.  Being a guy I know how hard it is to approach someone of the opposite sex.  All you need to do is have confidence in yourself.  Approach someone you like with a strong self confidence and he will think better of you.  Use your humor to your advantage.  Trust me, there is nothing better than a girl who is really funny.  As long as you feel comfortable with him you have nothing to worry about.  good luck

00968f46beefa6028a23b9e368627714aa	i feel the same way about my boyfriend. well ex- now. i realized that his past will always be a part of him, and that's something i don't want our child exposed to. he's used women, he's hung around with gangs, he's had wild sex parties all things that i couldn't have imagined doing and things i really find disgusting. I try not to hold it against him but it literally makes me sick to my stomach. I say if you find that you will not be able to deal with it and he doesn't want to talk about it then it's going to hurt your relationship tremendously. if it bothers you that much i say take time away to think and see if you really love him enough to forget about how bad his past makes your skin wanna crawl. i decided it wasn't for me bcus i know that he's still partly who he was when he was doing those things... and i don't want to be around them or to have my daughter grow up and be exposed to that or those girls. so i gave it up. good luck.|`|1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	this ain't your guy - find another or seek help|`|usFsjDxAaa	I am in the same boat with you.

1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	you see hate is a strong emotion - same as love and can be confused too - it's possible. Yeah, details vary in my experience.|`|AA10566861	When I first met my now boyfriend, I couldn't stand him.  I didn't really get to know him, we both lived in the same dorm for 2 years in college.  I just didn't like him for no good reason.  Then we started getting to know each other a bit, and I found out he wasn't so bad.  I still didn't have feelings for him though.  Then we both graduated and got to know each other again, and we have been dating over a year and are seriously talking about marriage.  <br>  <br>  Don't rule anyone out completely.  You never know!
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	Unfortunately this exclusivity thing is a restriction we put on ourselves. If your wife is looking for exclusivity than you are already cheating in some ways. Ways of the heart is pretty simple and that's what attracted you to her and vise versa but it's causing you a turmoil. Talk to her and don't expect her to understand but at least she'll be the one to confide in. This to me is cheating - if you could not pose this question to your loved one than you are in denial about the whole relationship and a life partner thing - revisit the values and characteristics of a good bond. If not explore life and don't be tied to just one. There is so much to explore with freedom. Learn to love yourself and you'll be fine. Put your happiness above others and only then you'll be able to make others happy. - wow - I couldn't stop typing

1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	your concern for his attention is way too much - tone it down a bit. You should realize that pleasing people is a dangerous way of getting attention. It's temporary plus failure rate is huge. Find another person - this dude is not into you and he seems to have some issues - he ain't all that and if you feel you are heavy - get into the habit of healthy eating - you'll look, feel and think beautifully. Hope you make out alright
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	you like her a lot - go out with her despite bill and barry, otherwise you'll always think about missing out on an opportunity. Don't metion other the guys when you are out - just have fun
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	Damn, they didn't answer - does that mean nothing? Now we'll never figure them out!
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	some are quiet - but it should be about enjoyment. If you're having a good time you'll know. No one should fake noises. I as a guy am pretty quiet but I love the art of doing it
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	Whatever you wrote is who you are according to you - don't sweat it. He doesn't see you the same way you do. You are hurting but make this an educational experience - let him be and go make someone else feel loved.

It is a great way to give pleasure; regardless of whether it is for foreplay, after play, or the main event. Like all other sexual skills, they must be learned, so communication is highly recommended. Whether the communication is before, during, or after, it is essential to learn the art. Finding out what he likes will invariably go a long way towards performing mind-blowing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, when you are performing oral sex, you are doing this for him. Sending negative vibes about not wanting to or how much of a chore it is will take away from his experience. If you act enthusiastic, chances are it will be over faster, and it will be your turn to receive. If you are really against performing fellatio, explain to your partner why you don’t, and don’t allow him to force you if you are uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Cleanliness is essential with virtually all forms of sexual play; particularly in oral sex where a bad taste or smell will undoubtedly dampen enthusiasm on the part of the giver. A bath or shower is a great primer, and can be the start of the festivities. If you are uncomfortable with a particular smell that your partner may have, suggest taking a shower with you, because you’ve had a busy day and don’t feel clean. You don’t want to point out the smell (unless it is a very common occurrence and can be prevented), as that will only lead to anxieties and take away from the overall experience.<br>  <br>  Positioning<br>  <br>  Finding an agreeable position for fellatio is usually not a difficult task. Both the man receiving fellatio and the person performing fellatio need to be comfortable. For deep throating, it is wiser to choose a position where the angle of the penis and the angle of your throat are somewhat aligned. For a better look at positions for oral sex, have a look in our sexual position section.<br>  <br>  The Basics<br>  <br>  Too often oral sex is initiated by sucking on the penis. To achieve a more powerful orgasm, it is better practice to start with some teasing. With the exception of a quickie, fellatio should be started with some well placed teasing. Start by kissing and licking around his penis, on the inner thighs, then on to his testicles, and then slowly up his shaft towards his glans (the head of his penis). Once you get there, use your tongue to tickle him around the glans, and especially on his frenulum, the split on the underside of his penis. At this point, he should be hard as a rock and super-sensitive to everything that you do. You can continue teasing if you like, but we don’t recommend teasing too long, as this can become frustrating for the receiver.<br>  <br>  One common problem women performing fellatio make is using only their mouth to repeatedly stroke his penis. They continue doing this until either it works, or they get a sore jaw and neck. A good “********” should not be too repetitive, should include stroking using a hand and the exploration of his testicles, thighs and (if you and he like) the anal region. By mixing up your style, you allow your muscles to relax, you can avoid getting a sore neck and you can improve your performance.<br>  <br>  How you mix it up should depend on what your partner’s likes. Although there is a lot to say about fellatio that can get the job done in a matter of minutes, it is the longer ones that usually result in more intense orgasms, and coincidently are remembered. (Click here to read about stroking techniques).<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to keep an eye on his scrotum (his testicle “sack”), as it is usually a good indicator of how close he is to coming. As a guy gets closer to climax, the skin on his scrotum tightens and pulls his testicles towards his body to warm them up. You can let this happen on its own, or help out by stimulating his testicles with a hand, tongue, or mouth. <br>  <br>  More Advanced<br>  <br>  Once you get the basics, and are comfortable and experienced with them, there are a lot of options to increase the pleasure. One option is using lubricants on his shaft. This will allow you to stroke faster without causing irritation. There are a wide variety of products that can be used,this includes: flavored lubricants, lubricants that heat up when blown on or rubbed, water based, oil based and many others. On this note, using whipped cream, spreads, and other food can also be incorporated to make the “********” more erotic.<br>  <br>  Sex toys can add more stimulation. Whether it is a regular vibrator, a vibrating cock ring, or an oral simulator, these toys can greatly intensify the stimulation. These days, there is virtually a sex toy for everything and everyone, so check out our toy store to find a product that is perfect for you.<br>  <br>  If your man likes to experiment, we recommend stimulating his prostate gland with your finger or an anal toy to take his orgasms to a whole new world of pleasure. For more information on this, please refer to the anal play article.<br>  <br>  Another more difficult to master skill is deep throating. In this, the performer takes the entire penis into the mouth and down the throat - hence the name. In many cases, the sensation is so intense that climax in men comes quickly. As enjoyable as this may be, it takes time to learn to control your gag reflex. You can train your gag reflex by trying to take as much of the penis as you can when performing fellatio. Your partner should restrain from any thrusting during this exercise! With time, you will be able to go deeper and deeper, until finally you’ll be able to take the whole thing.<br>  Ejaculation<br>  <br>  Most men find it very erotic to have a partner swallow their semen, but if you really don’t feel comfortable with it, don’t do it. Options include: catching it in your mouth, then spitting it out; using a tissue to catch it; or, just letting it shoot and clean up the mess afterwards. To find out more about semen, we suggest reading our article on male ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Many women stop performing fellatio right after their man ejaculates. Instead, you should continue to gently stimulate orally or with your hand for a minute or two longer. After a climax, the penis becomes much more sensitive, so try giving it to him a little longer. Be careful though, some men find this after-play too intense to handle.<br>  Warnings and Suggestions<br>  <br>  Very few men like the feeling of teeth on their penis. Teeth can cause discomfort, cuts, and scratches to the skin if you are not careful. This is easily avoided by tucking your lips around your teeth before you take the penis in your mouth.<br>  <br>  The use of condoms is highly recommended in the practice of safer sex. If you are not sure of your partner’s sexual history, it is strongly advised that you use a condom while performing any sexual act. If you want something a little more interesting try using a flavored condom and by all means stay away from the lubricated variety (the lubricants used on condoms taste horrible). A good suggestion for anyone using a condom during fellatio is to buy a flavored lubricant to turn a normal latex condom into a tasty condom. The normal rubbery taste of a regular condom can be all but eliminated by unrolling, washing (with mild soap and water), rinsing, drying and re-rolling (if for later use).

Mi dispiace sapere che stai così male. L'unico consiglio che posso darti è di cercare di concentrarti su quello che può aver ferito la tua ragazza e di immedesimarti in lei per capire davvero come riparare. Se non è la prima volta che la ferisci, sarà ancora più difficile, ma non disperare. Se nel chiederle scusa userai il cuore, e non solo la voce, e ti impegnerai innanzitutto con te stesso a cambiare, credo che lei sentirà la tua promessa come sincera e ti darà un'altra occasione.

Ma quali sono le tue paure? Se una ragazza guarda il tuo fidanzato, nel concreto ti toglie qualcosa?

Or was that the Danes who went under the guise of the vikings?|`|AA12361360	The bridal crown is an age-old tradition in Sweden.  Worn directly on the head or over the veil, a simple crown can be made from ribbon or for a more authentic Swedish<br>  feel, myrtle leaves.  If you have Swedish heritage, you may choose to wear the traditional folk dress of the community.  Originally peasant clothing, these colorful costumes are now worn for festive occasions or as formal wear. Wondering who will be the decision maker in the family? The Swedes have the answer.  The bride and groom usually enter<br>  the church together and whoever steps in first is said to be the one who will have control in the marriage.  If you’d rather the groom wait for the bride at the altar, that same tradition holds true for the one who says, “I do” the loudest.  Either way, it’s the bride who receives<br>  a morgong?va (“morning gift”) the day after the wedding.<br>  <br>  A wedding reception in Sweden is the ideal time to enjoy a traditional<br>  buffet known as a sm?rg?sbord.  There are many delicious dishes to<br>  choose from, but your sm?rg?sbord won’t be complete without sill<br>  (“herring”), lingonsylt (“cowberry jam”), Jansson’s Frestelse<br>  (“Jansson’s Temptation”), k?ttbullar (“ Swedish meatballs”),<br>  kn?ckebr?d (“hard bread”) and a sm?rg?st?rta (“sandwich like cake made<br>  from layers of bread, egg, and either shrimp or ham”).  Throughout<br>  dinner snapsvisor (“drinking songs”) are sung and all guests are<br>  welcome to give a speech in honor of the new bride and groom.   It is tradition for both father’s to make a speech during<br>  the reception."|`|a591cabfa7e855d1e4700799f7fa385faa	Swedish Wedding Traditions<br>  In Sweden, the parent's of the bride- to- be practice an old traditional wedding custom. Before their daughter leaves for the church to be married, her mother gives her a gold coin to go in her right shoe, and her father hands her a silver coin to be placed in her left shoe. This way they know she will never go without. <br>  <br>  After a Swedish couple exchange their marriage vows on their wedding day, the new bride will wear three bands on her wedding finger. One is an engagement ring, another is her wedding ring and the third is a ring for motherhood.

8a4a8478ab946fa5830b5455f639d8e2aa	Sai, in realta' o si e' gay o non lo si e'..  :-)   Cerco di farti capire meglio: ci sono uomini che si definiscono "leggermente" gay solo perche' quando fanno sesso con un uomo fanno i "maschietti", nel senso che trattano un uomo come se fosse una donna.. In questo caso alla tua domanda loro risponderebbero "6".. Poi ci sono quelli che da un uomo vogliono solo farsi fare un po.....ino, allora alla tua domanda risponderebbero "1".. La loro idea e' quella che una bocca vale l'altra ,e quindi non importa se e' quella di un uomo o di una donna..  Poi ci sono quelli che vanno con gli uomini definendosi "bisex", ma amano fare le "femminucce", e mentre lo prendono dicono "bella la f..ga, bella la f...ga".. Ecco, loro ti risponderebbero "0", perche' poi tornano a casa dalla moglie a fare i  "bravi" mariti.. Volevo precisare che costoro vanno anche con i trans.. E, si', perche' i trans piacciono agli uomini "normali", mica ai gay  al 100%.. E i "trans" che piacciono di piu' sono quelli che hanno ancora "tutto al loro posto"... E magari costoro sono quelli che con gli amici dicono "dai, andiamo a sfottere i travestiti!.. "  Mia cara, non aspettarti risposte serie alla tua domanda.. Sai, si dice "vizi privati, pubbliche virtu'.."  Io ho sofferto molto da ragazzino, perche' i miei compagni di classe mi sfottevano perche' ero "troppo" sensibile.. Per fortuna avevo e ho un carattere molto forte e mi dispiace tanto che Matteo non sia stato come me, come mi dispiace non averlo potuto aiutare.. Ecco, io ho cercato di imparare a non avere un atteggiamento "troppo" sensibile", pero' e' nella mia natura esserlo, piu' che essere gay da "1" a "10".. Quando una persona ne ama un'altra dello stesso sesso e ama tutto cosi' come e', non se lo pone nemmeno il problema di "classificarsi"..|`|1QztJcgAaa	ma che domanda dai...io sono me stesso perchè sono nico perchè amo il teatro perchè amo i miei genitori perchè amo mio fratello la vita i miei amici ed i ragazzi...punto|`|349a52849634afa3c0cfcd532c676572aa	Beh non vedo vie di mezzo.... o sei gay o non lo sei, al massimo puoi essere indeciso....Se con "quanto siete gay" intendi "quanto siete kekke" , io mi darei un 6/7..... ma a quanto mi dicono almeno 9 e 1/2!!

Dopo un pò, puoi buttarci la lingua, non indurirla. <br>  Trucchetto, leccale le labbra.<br>  Se lei nn è alla prima esperienza farà tutto lei!|`|pRpL7dv0aa	Certo...

Io non ho questo problema perchè il mio ragazzo russa solo di rado e poco, ma ho sentito molta gente che ha provato quei cerottini che tengono allargate le narici, e dicono che funzionano davvero, che con quello non russi più.

Anche Giuda credeva nell' amicizia però non seppe andare oltre per un un motivo cui é difficilissimo spiegare, perché il concetto che conosco io travalica la ragione umana. Intanto bisognerebbe sgombrare il campo dalla retorica perché noi tutti sappiamo parlare bene ma razzolare male. Chi é un amico? E per quale motivo gli é dovuto tutto? La mia tesi é che ognuno tende a relazionarsi in funzione di situazioni contingenti tanto che se venissero a mancare certi pretesti, l' amicizia durerebbe pochi minuti. Ora, al di la della retorica, se un vostro amico, per esempio, spaccia eroina o vi confida di essere un pedofilo, oppure sta preparando un sequestro di persona  per chiedere un riscatto, voi tutti come vi comportereste? <br>  Beh! ...qui in nome dell' amicizia conta poco, forse maledite il giorno che vi siete inguaiati nel conoscere questa persona fino a dargli fiducia, oppure fate la cosa migliore per il suo bene, cioè denunciarlo.<br>  Del resto essere amico di qualcuno solo per sbarcare il lunario é la cosa più sciocca che si possa fare, ma la domanda tende principalmente ad espandere la nostra coscienza oltre i limiti della retorica. Quindi se un amico è veramente nei guai e in virtù delle nostre scelte, a volta vili, giriamo le spalle, perché le sue precarie condizioni potrebbero pesare più di quanto non siamo in grado di saper gestire, cosa facciamo? Io francamente non ho risposte fantasiose, ne me la sentirei di snocciolare comportamenti eroici solo per soddisfare la platea di Yahoo Answers.<br>  Detto questo, naturalmente c'é anche il rovescio della medaglia, cioè questo vostro ipotetico amico cosa farebbe per voi ?  Siete sicuri che vi corrisponderebbe nella stessa misura della vostra ipotetica generosità?<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|h17Iru9Haa	premetto che non mi piace darmi dei limiti in niente....la lealtà la do ma la pretendo è un requisito fondamentale nell'amicizia quanto nell'amore e nella vita...credo di aver fatto molto anche per amicizie che non meritavano ma non rimpiango nulla che non aver perso un amico per colpa di qualcuno ma i veri amici si scoprono quando meno te lo aspetti e la mia lealtà viene premiata a distanza di anni ho amici a me cari con i quali mi confido pur abitando ad 800km di distanza..se ancora ci sono vuol dire che riesco a dare qualcosa no? primo su tutto appunto :la LEALTA'|`|4MFEqeoaaa	credo che per un`amicizia vera non dovrebbero esserci limiti. <br>  quando questi ci sono vuol dire che l`micizia non e` vera|`|DrF65QDiaa	Per una vera e sana amicizia ,credimi non mi spingerei mai a conquistarla,ma a fargli capire se impazzisco per lei,ma la offenderei,sai sono davvero sacrifici ,ma non importa,perchè la vera amicizia non esiste più e quindi chi davvero e fortunato ,la deve stringere forte a se e non farla scappare via|`|XStJsb3Caa	se è un'amicizia sincera penso che non ci sono limiti certo che però se devo creare danni ad altre persone allora no si cerca di trovare altre soluzioni|`|h0mIxgdbaa	secondo me qnd 1amicizia è vera nn c sn limiti...io penso d essere sincera al 90%....xke do tt me stessa qnd l'altra xsona fa lo stexo cn me...xcio penso k aiuterei 1amika/o...suxando tt i limiti...senza xo anteporre qst xsona a me stessa...ciau:D|`|tH3xHYk7aa	ciao lacrima<br>  la vera Amicizia nn ha limiti.<br>  io,ad un mio Amico nn chiederò mai,più di quello che può realmente offrirmi,proprio xchè mi è amico e gli voglio bene,mai lo potrei mettere in difficoltà chiedendo qualcosa di "rischioso" il problema nasce quando l'amicizia è a senso unico e si rischia di cadere in una strana forma di "ricatto"<br>  Baci<br>  Aldebaran25|`|tUAjMmn3aa	io penso che se l'amicizia è tra due sessi diversi al fine non sarà mai vera amicizia... forse nasce sempre qualcosa in più e forse no... comunque per amicizia si fa tutto, si da se stessi se è una vera amicizia... se invece gli altri se ne approfittano del termine amicizia sta a te capirlo...|`|vIrbyHQ6aa	tradire un amiko kuesto e il limiteda non superare mai|`|3xTOzgI2aa	bella domanda...ti 6 meritata la stella...se è 1 amicizia sana e sincera, ti dico ke farei di tutto per conservarla, mi metterei anche a urlare sotto la pioggia, o a rincorrere la mia amica per tutta la città sperando di incontrarla per darle 1 cuoricino cn scritto tvb.. nn mi è mai successo, ma lo farei, davvero.|`|bYdsplYxaa	non ci sono limiti tranne quello di non tradire se stessi|`|mWsTz1szaa	non c è limite x l'amicizia...se è quella vera

UcT0NSzuaa	I bambini indaco sono una razza di esseri con una Mente più sviluppata che sa con esattezza cosa è venuto a fare qui e che vuole portare a termine il suo progetto con consapevolezza. Non hanno sensi di colpa per cui, come possono essere gentili e affettuosi, allo stesso tempo, se non viene dato loro lo spazio di cui hanno bisogno, possono diventare aggressivi e irascibili e non sentirsi in colpa per questo. Ecco perché ci sono così tanti problemi nelle scuole e così tanti insegnanti di supporto in ogni classe.<br>  <br>  A volte bambini considerati "con problemi" sono semplicemente degli Indaco che hanno bisogno di un'attenzione diversa ma purtroppo la scuola non è in grado di gestire questi esseri perché non è capace di dare risposte intelligenti a domande importanti.<br>  <br>  La scuola di oggi insegna dei dogmi e un bambino Indaco, che normalmente ha un quoziente intellettivo superiore a 130, si annoia mortalmente ad ascoltare i vecchi programmi scolastici con domande senza risposte. E' difficile raccontar loro delle bugie e aspettarsi che ci credano perché loro sono più avanti di noi e si aspettano che noi comprendiamo.<br>  <br>  A volte ci trattano come mentecatti perché non vediamo e non percepiamo la vita delle dimensioni sottili, a volte si ricordano dov'erano prima di incarnarsi e si aspettano che anche noi lo ricordiamo, ecco perché a volte sono così insofferenti. E' come chiudere in una gabbia un animale abituato a correre libero nella prateria.<br>  <br>  Essi hanno 4 codoni nel DNA più di noi per cui il loro cervello è più sviluppato. Cosa significa ? Nessuno lo sa perché nessuno sa cosa sta succedendo sulla terra. Sappiamo solo che loro s'incarnano e vengono a portare pace nelle famiglie, fra i genitori e non è vero che s'incarnano in famiglie evolute spiritualmente o persone che seguono un percorso New Age. Tutto questo non ha niente a che vedere con la New Age.<br>  <br>  Alcuni di loro hanno poteri psichici, telepatici, di chiaroveggenza e chiaraudienza molto sviluppati, si ricordano le loro vite precedenti e si ricordano cosa vengono a fare questa volta, altri sono dei guaritori ed è sufficiente un tocco delle loro mani per guarire e curare le malattie più difficili.<br>  <br>  In generale sono portatori di pace, di fratellanza e di amore e vogliono aiutarci a modificare le nostre vibrazioni affinché lo sforzo che siamo chiamati a fare per entrare in un'altra dimensione della coscienza, sia il più soffice possibile e senza traumi. Sono i bambini di oggi e gli adulti di domani, saranno quelli che occuperanno posti di lavoro di responsabilità nella nostra società, sono quelli che saranno i nostri futuri politici, scienziati e medici.<br>  <br>  Alle loro domande bisogna rispondere con sincerità di cuore perché ciò che vogliono sono sentimenti veri anche se a volte possono non essere piacevoli. Loro si accorgono subito se ciò che dici viene dal cuore oppure dalla mente.<br>  Loro ci insegnano ad usare un'altra parte di noi stessi, quella più vera, ci insegnano ad essere noi stessi in tutte le cose e portare alla luce la nostra vera natura perché solo così possiamo trovare quell'energia che ci aiuterà a trasformarci da esseri umani ad esseri umani divini.<br>  <br>  Io ho visto bambini indaco nascere in famiglie estremamente in difficoltà sia dal punto di vista materiale che psico/emozionale, eppure loro arrivano a volte portandosi dietro dei destini difficili e pieni di sfide, ma con il coraggio di accettare tutto per uno scopo più alto. Sono Esseri coraggiosi che fanno progetti coraggiosi.|`|J5rhXHSBaa	booooooooooooo io nn ho mai sentito parlare di bambini indako!!!!!!!!|`|TvyBm9kaaa	non so|`|ZZBbCrxFaa	Mi sono informata dopo che il mio ragazzo me ne ha accennato. Se digiti le parole su un motore di ricerca troverai tantissimi siti che trattano questo argomento e ti accorgerai subito che nulla hanno di scientifico, nonostante vogliano apparire spesso seri. Per dire la mia questa storia è una grandissima cavolata. Ciao!|`|pUffWLLzaa	Io ne ho sentito parlare, sono una specie di profezia "new age" che sostiene ci siano dei bambini specialmente dotati che nascerebbero in questi nostri tempi moderni bisognosi di talento umano costruttivo.<br>  <br>  Per me è una stronzata colossale, ma sara'....

I find it easy to tell people what I like about them  and I tell them often ... so I guess I expect (or want )  them to tell me back .. most do or do first .. but one hardly ever said anything to me .. I was always wondering where I stood  .. drove me crazy and then even when I asked him ..he gave vague kind of no where answers .. what can you do ... if you really like him ..wait and work on it ..maybe tell him how you feel and then give it time to sink in  .. sometimes men just don't realize women need words ..|`|1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	no, but I have been asked that and it was only a matter of time when she got her confidence back.

It seems to me as he gave you the attention that you craved and he made you feel good and you have the maternal instincts to take him under your wing. Remember, he is a weak person and that does not change easily, you deserve much better. Go volunteer somewhere that'll make youl feel wanted.<br>  He'll take you down with him.

I mean I expect gays to want every one to accept them as normal I just don't see why people do. Every one that lives out side the boundaries of societies rules want to be accepted. But why accept them?There are a lot of things done by consenting adults that we shun as a society. Why is everyone embracing the homosexuals.|`|ipMrFfvoaa	Way to whack a hornet's nest! It's not my place to tell people how to live, but I know what I think.<br>  <br>  To say gender is irrelevant is to ignore nature. <br>  <br>  People are very quick to ignore everything that came before us and deny certain obvious relationships in nature. <br>  <br>  There is lots of money in the non-traditional sexual roles industry, so I wouldn't be surprised if people will rationalize more different kinds of "love" in the future. <br>  <br>  I know it's not popular, but I am old fashioned. It seems to make more sense to me than any other explanations I hear from social scientists and chemists. <br>  <br>  The female and male forming balanced energy in nature and perpetuating it through the physical manifestation of their non-physical connection. <br>  <br>  Of course, I know there are lots of people who think I should be denied of my opinion and hate me for it.<br>  <br>  It's ironic how things have come full circle in the hate prejudice department.|`|A6agxakwaa	tru|`|12be0f24b8af3a7010c3386b50f8471aaa	If you love the same sex person with physical attraction that will lead to sex. That is wrong and immoral in our society and non productive. As for loving a friend no matter what the sex is, yes it's irrelevant.  Very few Men will admit they love their friends. It's not manly....in this time of age.|`|AA11001110	Love?    Or being In Love.  Because they are different.   It takes a very long time to determine if there is enough love to sustain a relationship.  I think the only way to determine GENUINE love is when you're celebrating your 50th anniversary.  <br>  <br>  Love is not excitement or having sex everyday or being physically attracted.   Love is staying when your significant other is sick or worse.  Love is staying around when you don't "feel" like you're in love anymore.  Love is staying when the physical aspect of your relationship is gone.   Love is forgiving the seemingly unforgivable.|`|dde37d734765be96ae8b61a1c0a5b11caa	True. A person has a right to be happy with whoever they want. If a gay guy was forced to be "in love" with a female the love would not be genuine, therefore both would be unhappy and end up getting hurt|`|oyuvTImZaa	hell yah its true!!! im not gay or anything but i say as long as you love each other.. why does it matter what anyone else thinks??? gay pride!!! yessss|`|tpBUGkMEaa	to you it is. me i rather have those feelings for a girl than same sex. depends on where you want the feeling to be on.

UH2pnRF5aa	When its over its over just tell him straight. Don't lace the breakup with detrimental statements to create baggage from it on both sides.

s6dsNOGkaa	ma dài, hai bisogno di dichiarare quanto sei migliore amica? perché? si misura? <br>  Dopo di che: si sta male, sì, ad "abbandonare" qualcuno. Anche se non è esattamente un abbandono. Perché guarda che non diminuisce il "bene" per l'amica "abbandonata". Vedrai che buffo: quando la rivedrai sarà come l'ultima volta. Stessa confidenza, stessa complicità, stesse risate. Non farti sensi inutilisssimi di colpa (tienili per qualcos'altro): se le vuoi bene, le vuoi bene anche se non la senti per 30 anni, e puoi anche riderne. E' così, anche quando avrai 70 anni.|`|4MFEqeoaaa	mi sembra piu` che lecito avere 2 migliori amiche. se le senti cosi` non vedo quale sia il problema, l`importante e` che sei stata sincera con entrambe <br>   ciao|`|6Fv9ERWTaa	La migliore amica non è il fidanzato,di cui,si spera ,se ne possa avere solo uno.Entrambe posssono avere lo stesso ruolo nel tuo cuore ed essere "migliori amiche" senta per forza fare una classifica.|`|8fd017bc786a5c819f460050ebca5093aa	Da quando le amiche sono un "monopolio"???<br>  Presenta una all'altra, così smetterai di sentirti in colpa, e potrai frequentarle anche insieme, no???<br>  Io ho, esattamente, tre migliori amiche, e risalgono tutte ai tempi del liceo. Le nostre strade, a volte, si sono divise, poi incrociate di nuovo, ognuna di noi ha una famiglia, un lavoro, interessi e amici differenti...aggiungi, poi, che abitiamo in zone differenti e relativamente distanti tra loro... a volte non ci vediamo per dei mesi. Ma quando ci ritroviamo, è una gioia. Io le ho conosciute tutte in momenti diversi, e poi, alla fine, ho fatto da trait-d'-union anche tra loro. E non escludo di far entrare anche qualcun altro nel nostro rapporto (non una persona qualunque, ovviamente..!). Quando gli amici sono veri, più si è meglio è.

Così quando un giorno ho conosciuto un ragazzo che mi piaceva, ci sono uscita una paio di volte. NON MI SONO MAI SENTITA COSI' IN VITA MIA.....UNA M-E-R-D-A!! <br>  Ho lasciato il mio ragazzo (però non gli ho mai detto nulla), e da allora ho capito che non ci sono giustificazioni per mettere le corna.

Preciso storia a livello di quasi fidanzati (grazie a Dio me so salvata prima) .<br>  Lui assoldava ragazze in internet per fare i suoi porci comodi, addirittura una volta dopo aver scoperti entrambi... lei mi convinse che erano solo grandi amici (nel giro di pochissimi giorni era nata questa ''straordinaria amicizia''solo chattando....mah), lui mi disse che ne era attratto più di me....ma nn mi confessò il resto... <br>  Quando gli chiedevo di essere sincero, di dirmi se veramente mi avesse tradito non mi dava mai spigazioni  ( anzi,era molto lavativo,mi faceva capire che delle sue cose non dovevo impicciarmi...mi stato detto che ero visionaria e malata mentale.....infantile e viziata....... ) ....eppure.... lo amavo talmente tanto che anche promettendogli col cuore in mano che l'avrei perdonato se me l'avesse confessato subito, mi negò sempre... fino all'ultimo. Ho sempre avuto le prove che mi avesse tradito... ma ho sempre aspettato nella speranza mi confessasse tutto spontaneamente,non l'ho forzato perchè quello che provavo per lui mi rendeva tanto cieca...<br>  Dopo averlo lasciato (vi risparmio i motivi), ho scoperto da persone molto vicine a lui che addirittura aveva presentato una ragazza sopra a casa sua facendola passare per me.... e che non era la prima con cui mi aveva effetivamente tradita. Si era ancora più concretizzato tutto... tardi.<br>  <br>  Ed io ero la visionaria....<br>  <br>  A volte mi chiedo se sia stata stupida o no a restargli fedele nonostante le occasioni nn mi siano mai mancate....<br>  Ma la forza e la purezza dell'amore a volte ti spinge a non farlo, anche se la storia è al logoro... solo perchè rispetti il tuo patner e non oseresti mai farlo soffrire.... ovviamente personalmente è stato così, e penso che in un prossimo rapporto futuro comunque rispetterò questa mia regola, per altri sarà diverso sicuramente....<br>  Nel mio caso, cara Minù... il mio ex ce l'aveva nel sangue di fare il puttaniere da quel che ho appreso anche dalle sue stravaganti idee sessuali....<br>  Certi individui, parassiti... vagabondi.... addescano ragazze facili da ''impapocchiare''si dice dalle mie parti, cioè da plagiare, si assicurano dominio perfetto con una parlantina convincente (ma pochi fatti....irrilevanti una volta plagiata e con gli occhi SEMI-chiusi.....) ...influenzata la figlia si passa ai genitori, tramite la ragazza... i genitori son sempre disposti a farsi in 4 ai desideri di una figlia, soprattutto figlia unica.... e così pian piano si stabilisce in casa; mangia, beve, dorme, fuma gratis... ''il lavoro può aspettare'' come anche tutto il resto.... quando sta da solo in mezzo al suo caos di sempre... sfodera la sua doppia vita, tanto.... lei è lontana, me la sono assicurata, di scoprire non lo scoprirà mai che la cornifico.... e il benessere ce l'ho io...<br>  <br>  Cosa migliore che abbia mai fatto nella mia vita,<br>  averlo mandato a quel paese quando stava per essere sbattuto fuori di casa, aver sballato i suoi progetti su di me... e non aver la minima intenzione di tornare indietro.... adesso è lui che si corrode a quanto ho saputo... bene.... mi auguro solo in onore all'amore che gli ho donato a dismisura e che non meritava per niente... che non si becchi un ulcera come me, che non soffra così tanto come ho sofferto io per lui e che un giorno si sputi in faccia o si schiacci le palline quando e se ripenserà e si pentirà di quanto è stato str**zo.<br>  <br>  Minù... se anche te devi piegarti quando passi per le entrate delle stanze non disperare... non sei la sola:))<br>  Ehhh lo so... avrei dovuto sintetizzare... non so se verrà preso in considerazione o no... ma comunque<br>  Ti auguro tanta fortuna e tanto bene.... ciao bella e ciao a tutto il resto della compagnia:)|`|opDb1VSuaa	Esco da 8 mesi con un ragazzo che cornifica la fidanzata storica....<br>  avete letto bene il periodo 8 mesi!!!!<br>  Non capisco perchè non ammette a se stesso che con lei qualcosa non funziona +....<br>  paura?<br>  pentimento?<br>  sensi di colpa?<br>  Io non mi sento in colpa, certo mi spiace per lei anche se non la conosco...però da donna penso..che a lei forse fa comodo far finta di non sapere nulla...credo sia impossibile non accorgersene...<br>  voi che dite?|`|4MFEqeoaaa	io ho fatto parte di entrambi i ruoli<br>  e mi hanno fatto male tutti e due. penso che ho tradito perche ancora dopo 13 anni non me ne sono fatto una ragione di quando la mia ex moglie mi ha lasciato per un altro|`|6Fv9ERWTaa	Finchè non si conosce a fondo se stessi e si continua a vivere d paure e di maschere e della ccontentarsi,si troveranno persone a te iguali in questo senso.Quando si è liberi e si comprende cosa si desidera in amore ,la persona che avrai al tuo fianco sarà quello che realmente vuoi e non cercherai più nessun altro.Si tradisce perchè chi non ha trovato se stesso lo cerca negli altri.

Ask for her email or something and just talk to her.

Just have an open mind and be ready for any outcome. Time away is a pretty healthy thing for trust.

Aa9jYX4Oaa	This is not friendship it is something else, lose her.|`|4LcGwxt7aa	Well, all I can say is that you should talk to her.  Avoid the source of the reason you argue.  If she is mad at you for a reasonable reason, then let her be mad without arguing back.|`|AA11598063	Since you feel like she's using you, stop being her friend altogether. Friends are supposed to be there for each other, not use each other. You need to tell it like it is to her because if you let this continue, she will keep using you and it will become a repeated cycle. Put your foot down on her. She is not worthy of your friendship and you will find friends who will not take advantage of you. Don't waste your time being this girl's friend. Hope this helps and good luck.

Sono nella tua stessa situazione... dopo 11 anni passati insieme. Darti una risposta è difficile, xchè non riesco a trovarla neanche x me. Mi manca, vorrei sentirlo, parlare con lui. Lo amo ancora alla follia, anche se mi ha fatto molto, ma molto male. Ma vado avanti... non lo cerco, lo evito quanto posso.. ma non  per lui, x me stessa. Cerca di stare calma, anche se difficile (io ho perso 10 chili in due mesi!!), questo è l'unico consiglio che posso darti...<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|fs9dShR7aa	secondo me ti poni troppe domande ma è normale...anche io mi trovo a vivere una relazione da 6 anni con tre di convivenza...lo amo sì ma secondo me non ci rendiamo felici...e non perchè ci facciamo cattiverie ma perchè siamo totalmente diversi...la domanda non è semplice sai? spesso l'amore non basta in un rapporto perchè quando ami una persona non è detto che questa ti possa rendere felice dandoti il suo amore perchè magari ama in modo che non comprendi...che non ti colma quel bisogno di amore.Ti faccio un esempio se uno straniero ti manda a quel paese nella sua lingua(che non conosci) tu percepisci che ti sta dicendo una cosa non buona ma quanto puoi rimanerci male?? non sai che ti ha detto!! eh come puoi rispondere?? sicuramente non in modo preciso e dettagliato diretto alla sua provocazione. Bene ognuno di noi ha un codice d'amore sia nella sfera sentimentale sia fisica...e non è detto che la persona che amiamo abbia lo stesso nostro codice (parli la stessa nostra lingua) quindi anche se percepiamo il suo amore questo non ci appaga completamente e non sappiamo neanche rispondere nel  modo giusto per farci capire...e se siamo persone esigenti o che sappiamo veramente quello che vogliamo a lungo andare ci esauriamo di fronte a tale difficoltà...lo so che è difficile da ammettere e lo so che per riaverlo rinunceresti al tuo codice d'amore ma credimi a lungo andare ti dimenticheresti chi sei perderesti la tua unicità che invece potrebbe farti trovare l'uomo della tua vita senza troppe rinunce anzi...potrei scrivere per un'ora sull'argomento ma voglio concludere dicendoti comunque che ti capisco e che anche se ho scritto tante cose a riguardo ancora non riesco e non ho il coraggio di prendere una decisione...Ti auguro un'imbocca al lupo specialmente auguro che ti accada nel bene o nel male la cosa che in futuro serà migliore per te.

tlNnIYZzaa	Well hon u will have plenty of time to live together,dont rush things cause its a very huge step, let him and his friend live together for awhile let him come to u later and ask u he will just act like its not bothering u, once u two move in together little things will get on your nerves about him  and things will get on his nerves about u, even though u two love one another .... living together if u havent been together for a very long time is hard on a relationship believe me. Good luck   ms_princess_36@yahoo.com|`|AA10960571	Well maybe it is for the best now you get to see if this is really the person you want to be with.  I say one of the ways to know is to live with someone.  If he doesn't want to move in with you fine do not pressure him because if you do then it will not be a good situation for either one of you.  Let him move in with his friend that doesn't mean you cannot go over there and see what is going on.  But if he says he wants to do what he wants then I think that means he is having second thoughts about your relationship or maybe something else is going on.
dfe945563b9ae826cfae830b6fe16121aa	Alone... no matter what they say you cannot depend on a roomate. And when it comes down to it, who really wants to share their space. I have a friends stay over if I get lonely...but I do not want a roomate, my space, my stuff, my junk, my mess, my rules, my everything... I do not have to worry, I can have who ever I want over when I want, for how long I want, oh yeah I can run around naked...|`|6f5841bec19f340389ec241da7fe082eaa	Well if you feel like you need your privacy and need your place to yourself then be alone. Having a roommate is having someone there 24/7 you can't kick them out whenever you feel like it. Plus roommates aren't always the best thing for people because they stay in arguments. But it's really up to you just make sure that whatever your decision is the best for you and your ready for it. Good Luck

You'll end up being the bad guy, trust me, I've been there.<br>  <br>  I saw my friend's B/F one day and happened to mention it to her a week later.  Well, he wasn't supposed to be where he was, then swore he wasn't there!  He was there, but she ended up just forgetting the whole thing.  I think she was even kinda mad at me for awhile.  It's so not worth it.|`|3Q9WKXgjaa	I was just thinkig to tell u that u must tell this to her while reading when I saw that u said u did try to tell her.U as  a friend u did what u had to do.  Knowing such  a thing it was ur duty to tell it to her.  Now that she's not believing u is her problem.  what really counts is that u did ur duty.  Now u don't have to do anything else.  Now it all depends on her if she wants to control her boyfriend or if she prefers ignoring what her friend is telling her.You can't and must not do anything alse or else your friend will start thinking seriously that u are jealous of her and that u are trying to put her affair in crisis purposely.

She's probably a bit uncomfortable, but it'll pass. She'll chill out later, especially since she no longer likes her ex-boyfriend. She might be ignoring you because she's trying to figure out if she really truly likes you. Try making coversation with her tomorrow, and watch how she behaves around you.

cxWWioNyaa	it's completely normal to like someone and not know why. Those are usually the times when its real, the times you have a reason it just means that its not comming from the heart. As for not liking him, i don't think there's a way. If it isn't meant to be then it won't. But you have to trust God, and whatever he has in store for you. There is a reason for everything, so there must be some reason God wants you to still have feelings for him. You never know, he might see something in you later...just don't try to not like him. Let your heart lead you where you need to go.

81f0f13134d2e26915f7776b66103c9eaa	I think you need time with just you and accept the divorce, before exploring new things.  Find yourself, before allowing someone else in.  18 years is a long, long, time.  Trying to add someone through your ordeal at this time, is not recommended.  They will just end up hurt.  Your not ready to date.  Find yourself, before you go on the dating scene. .  Thats the only way, you will be rest assured, the person is not preying on your hurt, to score.    I still say, you need time to collect yourself.  So much emotional and physical and mental investments were put into your 18 year relationship.  It ended, sadly.  Time to find yourself, and build yourself up again, before trying to include a new partner in your life.  Its not only fair for the new partner, its VERY FAIR, to you.  You still need time to heal.  Just my opinion.  All the best.|`|3HIfpJsqaa	yeah heaps of ppl feel like you do!<br>  <br>  Just stay out of the dating scene for a while untill you move on and feel a bit better!<br>  <br>  Goodluck and hope you feel better soon!|`|mPmnXMrBaa	You'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you wait until you've gotten rid of your luggage.<br>  <br>  Being mature enough to go out with someone for the company and getting to know them without having sex sounds very smart.<br>  <br>  At least you know you'd be comparing them to the ex and that isn't fair to you or them.|`|24560a9ac430e096d500b15e19f95030aa	I know a guy at work who goes through the same situation you do.

27670afd87e23b0b47100f2e9a4815a5aa	sounds like the stupid 6th grade drama that i had to deal with back then. you should talk to her about how you feel. it may be hard for you but you should definatley try. i'ts worth it because you may lose her. if she is a good friend she wouldn't complain about something so stupid. last year (8th grade), i had just moved over to a new school. during recess, i would walk around the field by myself. my so called "friends" hated the fact that i didn't talk to them or walk around with them. i felt at peace not being surrounded by a bunch of people. some times you just need to be alone. don't let this drama get to you. later on in life, you'll realize how stupid it was. good luck with your friend and talk to her!!<3|`|qnnnt89Gaa	Well, I find that A stupid reason to be mad at someone.|`|oP7eRos1aa	she's mad about that!!!! well u should knock some sense into her (by talking)

Shy girls might look away if they're caught looking at you, while bolder ones might hold eye contact for a while. <br>  <br>  If she likes you, and you like her in return, go for it!

My friends and I curse, but we dont call eachother names like b****. She shouldn't be cursing anyway. My friends and I are in 10th grade, so its a littile more reasonable.|`|PgVtqvv6aa	It sounds like Victoria has hidden agendas that benefit only her.

Avra' ed ha anche commesso errori ma io gli sono ultra-grato di quello che ha fatto e, oggi, che ne ho io ventidue anni, mi ha ripetuto piu' volte di essere orgogliosa di me. io sono a milano da solo, mi sto mantenendo, inseguendo una passione che spero diventi la mia vita.<br>  non mi manca niente, quello che mi manca me lo procuro ormai sono indipendente, quindi...<br>  non aver paura, se tu sei (come sembri essere) una madre premurosa i tuoi figli cresceranno bene lo stesso, anzi cresceranno meglio con te vicino piuttosto che con una persona vigliacca e irresponsabile accanto come "avrebbe dovuto essere"...<br>  l' unica cosa e' che nella tua superiore premura (rispetto a quella di un nucleo famigliare standard, dovrai fare da "padre" e "madre" insieme) devi stare attenta a non soffocarli. <br>  loro hanno comunque un loro percorso da fare e qst e' fondamentale.<br>  <br>  ti ammiro molto. <br>  ciao :)|`|9b2be220b6ff466fb751c618460fd135aa	Cara Dalyla, mi dispiace molto per quello che ti è capitato, sei stata sfortunata ma i tuoi bimbi ti ripagheranno per tutto cio' che hai passato. Magari lui tra un po' di tempo si renderà conto dell'errore, non puo' perdersi gli anni piu belli dei suoi bambini. Se invece lo fa vuol dire che è davvero privo di sentimenti! Tu devi essere forte per loro, lo meritano, ed io spero che tu possa trovare al piu' presto una persona che ti ami e sappia amare anche loro. Quando ti chiederanno del loro papà non dire cose cattive su di lui e neanche delle menzogne per coprirlo, quando sarà il momento credo che le parole ti usciranno da sole.<br>  Io ho perso mio papà da piccola, avevo sei anni quando lui è morto, ed ho pochi ricordi di lui.

Non sarà facile, ma penso che una volta cresciuti non avranno voglia di vederlo "il papà", non aver paura, non penso cresceranno male, non stare loro troppo addosso per compensare l'assenza dell'altro genitori, sarebbe sbagliato. Cerca di crescerli nel modo più naturale possibile, e soprattutto non sentirti in colpa, non soffrirne perchè potrebbero soffrirne anche loro.

Per quanto riguarda il dire o non dire qualcosa ai tuoi figli del loro papà ti consiglierei di parlare sempre bene di lui davanti a loro, di non dire loro che lui non vuole vederli perchè è una verità che fa veramente male specialmente da bambini ...piuttosto inventati qlc ...per la verità "vera" c'è sempre tempo quando loro saranno più grandi potranno metabolizzare meglio il tutto ...cerca inoltre di costruirti un futuro anche tu ma stà molto attenta ,,chiunque deve prima voler bene ai tuoi figli che a te ... vai con i piedi di piombo!

OIoYvFfraa	mmm well im a man and there a 3 women i know who i love to bits they are so beautiful, great personalities and i would do anything for them, but i wouldnt let them know how i feel through fear of loosing them as a friend. When i see them i do look at them, so maybe he likes you a lot too but converstaion is kept to a minimum to keep feeling hidden, start a conversation going a slyly find out if he like you be slightly flirtatous if he likes it then its a good sign, if he immitates what you do and say this is also a relativly good sign it shows he likes your company and is paying attention|`|AA12339988	you may think that you love him but you have to know him more than just hi and bye to figure that out <br>  you cant fall in love like people think it takes more than that|`|Rnn5yzsvaa	Next time you guys say bye, ask him what he's doing at the weekend and ask if he wants to come see a movie or something with u!<br>  Good luck

naw3PBFbaa	who is the person|`|QqrRFcreaa	Some say that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Another saying is that people want what they can't have. A lot of people don't know what they have until it's gone. As humans, we're creatures of habit, which means it is so easy to take someone for granted and really takes extra special effort to keep sparks alive (talk to anyone happily married 20+ years). To keep the mystery around, do something new once every week or two, something new for you - a new sport, activity, adventure, to keep discovering yourself and making new friends while captivating this person. If this person is really pursuing you and you want him/her, then spend enough time in his/her presence for him/her to know you are seeking adventure (making sure you show your true friend traits - active listening, mirroring, empathy), but always leave time for yourself and your closest friends (stay grounded or you will seem and become desperate).  Defining yourself and making your search for a partner less confusing involves sorting out your values (motivationalinterview.org/library/value... into categories of very important, important, and not important, for both yourself and what you want/need in a partner. We all can get swept away by someone pursuing us and/or playing hard to get, but this will help you avoid wasting your valuable time with people who will not likely be compatible with you. Good luck.
