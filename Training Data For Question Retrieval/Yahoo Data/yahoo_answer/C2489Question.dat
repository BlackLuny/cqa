20090309180347AAcEvgN	Arts & Humanities;History	What is the relation between "modern" day goth and the Goths of history?	I've been familiar with the term goth most of my life and now today I find out there were a group of people in history called "Goths." How did that old term come to be applied to what we know as "goth" today?      If you don't know what I mean, here's a link to the wikipedia page about the Goths in history:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths 
20090309181422AADsZyg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How can I fix this one line? I can't think of anything....?	Oh, and how's it sound? thanks! I know i've asked this today (sort of) but how does it sound anyway...      Tape.   Tape sticks because it's significant   less significant then a grape.  (****How Do I Fix That?***)   Why doesn't it stick forever?   nothing good last forever   all things fade into the back.   loose their stick   die slowly   Though no one notices this one piece of tape when it is gone   The rest continue to live happily   and now that one piece is lost; away   No one notices; though all should pay.   Was that tape always worth less?   Did it once serve a purpose in life?   Or does everyone have better things to do than grieve over a piece of tape?         Thanks :)

20090309180912AAKlCem	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Heeeey everyone what do you think of this poem?	i just wrote it haha, i've never really written anything, and i did this on a whim, but i think i really like writing! it's fun (:      but anyway, just give me your opinions. thankkya <3      It’s time to go.   Time to leave.   Time to run.   And now you grieve.      And now I sit, at the dark kitchen table.   Wondering if I’ve done it again.   Wondering if I’ve cut myself short.   Wondering if I’ve lost a good friend.      But what were you to me?   Only a boy. A young, careless crush.   You were nothing of substance.   You didn’t care much.      Of course, I could be wrong. In fact, I    Very well may be. But I can’t be bothered with you.   I can barely be bothered with me.      You say that you “like me”. But what does that mean?   We try to be grown…but we’re still so na?ve.      Yes, it’s reached that hour, butterflies in my gut.   You open up, and I slam my door shut.      Couldn’t let you get too close, could I?   Couldn’t let you go too deep, could I?   No, for what would become of me, if we ever parted?   You’d be taking a piece of me with you. And I don’t think I can    Lose another piece of me. Soon, I will be nothing.      So for now we wait indefinitely. Now which road shall we take?   We sit at kitchen tables, and think of our mistakes.

Oh and I am a guy, so don't give a part that is obviously a female speaking. Thanks in advance.

20090309181118AAlmS83	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What will Kant say about this?	IN ANSWERING THIS Q, please identify specific points in his theory.   -----   In England, the Whitaker family faced a terrible situation: their son, Charlie, suffered from a rare disorder that prevented his body from producing red blood cells. Without daily medications and frequent transfusions, Charlie would simply die. With them, he continues to live, but under close medical care.       For a while, it looks as though Charlie’s parents had figured out an answer to this dilemma. They proposed to use in vitro fertilization to have another child, but with an added twist. They would, as is usual in this procedure, have the eggs fertilized outside the womb in a laboratory dish, but they would then include an additional step. Using new screening techniques, they would screen the embryos to see which would be most able to donate blood-making cells to Charlie. That would be the one that they would choose to implant and bring to term.       In contrast to the United States and many other countries, in England someone proposing such a procedure must obtain government permission –in this case, from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority. The Authority rejected the request by the Whitaker family, saying that it was not right to create a human life with the express intent of saving another life.       ----

20090309184122AA4US5q	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please read this tell me if it is any good?	Life and Love is like balancing a stack of books on your shoulders and one wrong move can make it fall like the Roman Empire. And it’s just as bad when you have to choose between work and love. You have to choose love and your family over work right. But what if that choice costs your job. But isn’t life and love work. It may not be the same kind but it is work. You have to separate them from each other even if it is as hard as life. But what if that choice wipes everything clean. I’ve always seen things in color while most see in black and white. And I like seeing in color because everything’s laid out for you. People don’t look what’s  right in front of them. I could have been a reporter but I chose to be a Lawyer. But a good thing is both need you to look at the facts and not your opinion even if your opinion is your gut felling so when I choose an opinion over a fact it changed my whole way of looking at things.                                             Preface      Love , Life, and to sum it all up work   It had been 3 years since I had adopted Caucasian twins. They were feternal twins, a girl and a boy. Jack and Jamie were their names. I had even made up a story about super heroes and I named the heroes after them. I called them the athletic twowo. There were only 2 things that were the same about them, one being they were very athletic and two they were very caring over one another. I am a lawyer, and my Thanasi owns a restaurant we share it but he has the morning shift I have the night. I was getting married this summer July 23, 2036 to be exact. Then I would go on a honeymoon we’d go places like Italy, France, Greece, and many more European countries. I truly do love the man I’m marring and I love my twins this is only the beginning of this long tale about Love, Life and work. I don’t know who said that love is the key to everything but he’s wrong it don’t help you at all. It cost me my job. Oh did I skip ahead opps. If I ever do that again don’t let me finish my line. Say Cindy be quite your skipping. Oh you wouldn’t tell me any ways you guys want to know what’s going to happen don’t you. Well turn the page and the story will really begin.

20090309183521AALUAsG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm looking for the name of this young adult book?	I read this book back when I was a kid and really enjoyed it but I can't remember the title.      Anyway a short synapses: Mankind had discovered how to travel back into time. They sent two men back 65 million years ago to discover why the dinosaurs where wiped out.    They discover that the dinosaurs are infected with a blue ooze that are aliens from mars which allows them to talk.    There ends up being a conflict and the two men destroy one of the two moons that orbit earth and increase the gravitational pull which kill all of the dinosaurs as they can no longer walk.    The men end up going back to their own time (I think) and the aliens evolve to become viruses.

But i need to make sure it is going to capture peoples attention, does is make you want to read further? Feel free to tell me if its absolute crap, i can take it.      here it is:     Chapter One -A Strange Sighting   The doorbell rang at 8 O’clock like it does every night. I ran downstairs to let Doug in. He stood in the doorway with a huge smile on his face.    “Ready to go?” he asked me.   “Go,” I asked, bewildered, we usually just hung out and watched old movies in the basement all night “Go where?”   “Well, I got tickets to this concert, I you wanted to go. If not I can give them away,”   “Concert? You mean the AAR concert?”   “Mhmm,”   “Seriously?” I squealed jumping up and down.   “Yup,” he said, the grin on his face widening at my reaction.   “You are the bestest friend ever,” I said, flinging my arms around him.   The concert was amazing. I was still singing as Doug pulled me out into the parking lot. It was raining hard outside but that didn’t do anything to ruin my high spirits.     We were just around the corner from my house when the car came towards us. The last thing I saw that night was the trucks headlights before it hit us. The next morning I was in the hospital and the doctors were telling me I would never walk again.

20090309192411AAiHO7I	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My poem, whatcha think its about?	Overtime i think of you,   I just feel weak, mentally and physically   We dabble with each other often.   Whenever i have the bling bling.   I Often wonder how i became so lucky to meet you.   Because i just couldn't imagine being happier without you   You have that way about you, That just makes things   appear so much simpler, seeing things much more clearly   Really no negative situations.   But your awesome Presence, and sheer power.   Don't make up for the bad.   Especially when your not around.   When you aren't with me,    I just can't seem to find that strength within myself   I feel depressed, lousy and lazy   Its amazing how sometimes i can make through the day without you   Your expensive baby, and is much as i love you.   Im going to have to let you go.   You made me so dependent, almost pathetic.   And i just hate to see myself like this.   And i just can't keep doing this.   And you knew it might eventually come this too.   So please don't be sad. I hope you can understand   For my leaving. But i owe this to myself,   I need to get better, and the only way thats possible   Is if im without you..      Goodbye and im sorry.

20090309193916AASZDvN	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Question about this poem? really need help.?	Losers by Carl Sandburg      IF I should pass the tomb of Jonah   I would stop there and sit for awhile;   Because I was swallowed one time deep in the dark   And came out alive after all.      If I pass the burial spot of Nero   I shall say to the wind, “Well, well!”—   I who have fiddled in a world on fire,   I who have done so many stunts not worth doing.      I am looking for the grave of Sinbad too.   I want to shake his ghost-hand and say,   “Neither of us died very early, did we?”      And the last sleeping-place of Nebuchadnezzar—   When I arrive there I shall tell the wind:   “You ate grass; I have eaten crow—   Who is better off now or next year?”      Jack Cade, John Brown, Jesse James,   There too I could sit down and stop for awhile.   I think I could tell their headstones:   “God, let me remember all good losers.”      I could ask people to throw ashes on their heads   In the name of that sergeant at Belleau Woods,   Walking into the drumfires, calling his men,   “Come on, you … Do you want to live forever?”         i think this poem mainly talks about death, but he makes references to some historical figures that i dont really know whats he's trying to say. what else besides death is this poem suppose to mean?   thanks for answering :D

Tell me what you think about the writing, feelings, etc.    :)            My life is a bottomless canyon of lost hopes and false smiles,   I hide behind a mask that is what others see.      Love is someone that I have never met,   Though I have been introduced to many of his impersonators.      Friends, you ask?   Why I have none to speak of, friends meaning someone that I regard with affection, trust, and them returning it back.      What I do have are acquaintances,   Ones who lie, cheat, and steal, but are there to laugh with me when I do something foolish.      My days consist of only black and white,   Except for the vivid red that glistens when I paint on my frail skin with the small silvery blade.      Some days I wonder if the world would become a better place without me,   And others I wonder if anyone would even notice.

20090309184927AAwaTBc	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Do Polaroid cameras take a special kind of battery?	yeah so i'm a fan of vintage or any type of film cameras and i picked up my most recent polaroid in a thrift shop like 3 weeks ago. it's a later version of the 1986 One Step (possibly manufactured in the 90's?) and takes 600 film.       recently, i was playing around with it, when suddenly the flash stopped charging itself back up and the motor that shoots out the finished photographs refused to work.      now i imagine that Polaroid cameras run on a battery of sorts, but i've never run into a snag such as this where the cameras power supply seems to have run out. so my question is this:      Is there a special kind of battery that Polaroid cameras take? If so, where can I find such batteries and are they as expensive as the film nowadays?

Tell me what you think please First prize is $100 so I want it to be good!      1.Our Lives   Our lives we can say are horrible, say that no one cares   talk like no one is listening,cry like there are no tears   live like there is no tomorrow, think without any thoughts   but the truth about life is...it's not horrible, people do care. When you talk he is listening.      2.Tears   D-R-I-F-T-I-N-G through the wind just swirling in a circle   Everything seems alright echoing off beams of light   softly, gracefully becoming N-O-T-H-I-N-G gently winding down to sleep   I cry inside the deep ocean of my heart always there   now I need to be shy to show it, just a shoulder to cry on. But I can't reveal what I feel in an audience of revelers   If you only would hold me once, again I would know something. And cry settling in the covers of a once unknown mind. JUST. BE. THERE. FOR. ME. please? If you could just be there for a moment as my teardrops ripple on the river-then maybe? everything would be...ok.      3. What she never saw in herself   she moves with grace, yet stumbles and trips.   you'll hear a break of laughter as she smiles, an outburst of noise, the perfection is there if you could crawl under the first layer of mistakes and insecurities. Then you'll see the person worth listening to, the one that most people try to find in themselves, what she never saw in herself.      4.Tell ME   tell me how i'm feeling   tell me what I dream   tell me i'm just acting    tell me how I seem   tell me who I hate   tell me how I like   tell me how I rate   tell me you are right   tell me how I look    read me like a book   then I'll tell you something, although I know you won't agree. Only I know what I'm thinking b/c only I am me.      5. Confusion   confusion   the state of mind i'm often in.   In and out of it so sudden.   Confused by the things I thought I knew   confused b/c I'm in love with you.   I don't know how I got here, I don't know how long I'll stay.   But soon enough I'll be on my way.   In love with a player   In love with the game   In love you're so charming   In love and to blame   Confused why I let myself   Confused this can't be me.   Confused by the fact I'm in love with someone who will never love me.   Confused with the tears I never let fall    COnfused b/c I gave you them all   I never thought I'd be here, I can't wait to leave   I'm in love and hurting and you don't see.   Love is confusion, it's a game.   When you get hurt there's no one to blame, except your confusion.

20070303121008AAs3GJ5	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Comment  se former au métier de comedien?	réponse à la question "comment devenir comedien et en vivre "     Prendre des cours de comedie dans une bonne école d'art dramatique ( malheureusement ce sont des cours privés donc chers). Les cours de théatre à la Fac ne sont pas adapté à une formation professionelle au métier de comedien . Ils sont surtout théorique mais peuvent être suivis en complément de cours privés . Le mieux reste bien sur de réussir à entrer dans un conservatoire national ( Le plus connu reste le conservatoire national d'art dramatique , mais il y a aussi celui de Strasbourg ...) . Mais l'entrée se fait sur concours . Au fait, la Comédie Fran?aise n'est pas une école ;) Etre comedien , c'est un métier très dur ( 99% de travail et 1% de talent ) il faut être passioné car comme tout métier artistique ,c'est un métier qui demande beaucoup de sacrifice et de travail . (et de volonté) . On ne devient pas comedien parcequ'on veut devenir une "star" , parcequ'on recherche la gloire.   On devient comedien parcequ'on a ?a dans la peau.
