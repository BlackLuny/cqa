We filed a complaint and Wells Fargo refunded our money within 10 days and is pursuing an investigation to get their money back. We changed accts in fear of them doing it again..and to our complete shock..once again[TODAY!] 2,000 was stolen out of our new savings this time..we are completely shocked and don't know how they could have possibly gotten our savings number..because we do not use this account for ANYTHING..but to save up money..wondering if anyone else has gone through anything like this?! We will be getting our money back in 10 days once again..but im just really irritated at the inconvienence and trying to understand for the life of me how they do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I do know that you can use a wireless internet card for PC or wireless laptop and use the Ethernet slot as an output.  Now, what I'm wondering is, can I take that output and extend it into a another router?  The new router is going to be hard wire only, no wireless.      The reason why I want to do this is because I am finishing the space above my garage as a place for me to do my work.  But I have multiple computers so I can multi-task.  I will also have an xbox so that I can just use the area as a place to relax.      Is this at all possible to use a computer that receives wireless internet and use the Ethernet slot as an output to another router?

I'm looking for a program that allows me to put computer limits to certain programs or computer settings.      For example i need a program that can disable my computer clock, so nobody can change its settings, also so nobody can access control panel and change settings and disable computer search.    Those are the main ones I'm looking for.      Why do i want this?      I have a parental control software that restricts internet time limits, so people in my house have figured out that if you just change the clock settings in the computer by changing the time, the internet won't be block because they changed the time.         Please don't tell me to buy another parental control software because most of them are like that, i have tried them.            ""What I need is a separate Program that restricts the computer, kind of like schools where in the computers you can't change settings.""

20090306221422AAWvwQt	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What can cause this to happen?	when using onboard GPU the computer screen clicks like it's changing resolutions but turns distorted and the computer freezes.   It's an older computer, asus A7N8X-VM /400, 512MB, 128MB of that is  shared with onboard GPU. It has an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ CPU, an older 80Gb Hard drive. The thing is that it works for a little while then out of nowhere the screen flickers like it's changing resolutions, but comes back all distorted, you can see color disfiguration and the computer is frozen. Used an older TNT2 card just to see if it would happen but it doesn't. Well I haven't used it long to enough because it has no 3D acceleration on it.   what could the problem be?maybe just over heating?

20090306232726AAgbKkf	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Is my CPU the bottleneck?	I recently upgraded my video card from a Geforce 8800GT to a Geforce 250, 216 core. Before my 3Dmake06 score was in the high 9000s, now its in the mid 10,000s. I was expecting more of an increase. I have noticed an performance increase in some games, but the increases are marginal. This leaves me to believe my CPU and RAM might be a bottleneck, because I believe I should see more of an improvement with a card with nearly double the performance. I want this video card to get a workout, and need to know for sure if the CPU is truly holding it back.      Here are my specs:   Win XP   AMD Athlon X2 5000+ Black Ed.

20090307000456AAMWSuL	Computers & Internet;Software	My Fujitsu Lifebook T1010 And Where Can I get Drivers For Vista 64 Bit Operating System?	So anyway, I have a Fujitsu Lifebook T1010 laptop/ tablet pc, and it has a 64 bit processor.  The actual processor is a Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26 processor with Centrino 2 Duo technology.  In the specs of the Lifebook T1010, it actualy says that it is a 64 bit processor.  According to further research, the computer is 64 bit Vista operating system compatible.  But when I instaled the 64 bit OS and went to update all the drivers, software, etc... the restore disk that came with it that has the drivers and software on it won't load due to them being 32 bit compatible only.  So I went to the Fujitsu site to download all drivers and software, and from what I saw, everything would work except for the Intel Series 4 graphics.  The drivers that Fujitsu had listed is not intended for the 64 bit OS.  When I went to the Intel website and downloaded the graphics drivers for the Vista 64 bit OS, they wouldn't install, and the error said that I had to get the drivers from the manufacturer's website.  And of course, on rechecking on the Fujitsu site, Fujitsu does Not list the 64 bit OS drivers or software.  I am seeing this error on more and more computers these days, but yet they are in fact 64 bit OS compatible pcs.  So I wanted to ask a tech out there in Yahoo land or wherever if there was some kind of work-around for me as to where I can get the drivers for the 64 bit OS.  And also,  if there was a webpage where I could get these drivers and software for my Fujitsu Lifebook T1010.  Also,  is there anything in my computer's system that I could enable/ disable in order for it to recognize the Intel 64 bit drivers?  Because Intel also lists updated graphics and chipset drivers for my Lifebook T1010, but when i try to install them,  I get the same error message.  Why is this happening?  And why won't Fujitsu either provide the updated graphics or at least allow people to download and install them successfully from the Intel website?  Please help?  I really would like to have the 64 bit OS installed on here, or at least be able to update my chipset and graphics drivers to the lates ones that Intel offers?  Thanks,  and please assist?

I've noticed recently that viruses are getting exceptionally good, and I'm wondering what the cause is? Recently my friend's daughter got a huge virus on her computer from "anti virus 2009" and gave it to me to look at. It was so bad, you couldn't even format the hard drive without it saying you cannot do this. I ended up using expensive software to fix it. A couple of days later my brother was using a p2p file sharing site for an anti virus, and got a virus so bad that he ended up formatting the hard drive and re-installing everything. A couple of days later a virus from another p2p sharing website killed my computer so bad they had to replace the hard drive. Thank god for insurance. So I'm just wondering, what's going on with p2p file sharing websites, and why have viruses gotten so much worse?

20090307140528AAY0Svd	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	Does this sound MODEST or general sounding???? (OPEN LINK!) Thanks "?"?	Im a professional 30 y/o and want my profile to be more "about me" here is one section I want to put up. (It is the longest!) Remember, I am married, and my "fun" days are over! So im not trying to seek attention much.      - My Semi Professional Life -   If it weren’t for the cut off mark of one page, and my pocket full of white lies, my work resume would be littered with typical full time entry level occupations. At various times I've managed over 50 personnel along with billing and scheduling as a secretary for a local security company; Cooked & Cleaned House for the elderly, been a waitress, a Subway sandwich artist, a Rite Aid cashier attendant, A Tulare County pre-foreclosure agent, Assisted a private investor in putting together a Huge Workshop Seminar for Real Estate, Worked as an independent negotiator for a Real Estate Brokerage getting commissions off of houses that I brought to him, working retail at the mall as a sales clerk (my sales topped the managers), then finally jumped on the bandwagon with Daniel when real estate was through the roof. I never in my life, believed I would work in this field of employment. I was never taught a thing about real estate by anyone, until I proved that I could help benefit someone financially as an intern or partner. After all, I was just another young girl. One who wasn’t outspoken or sought to be in the spotlight. I read up on plenty of books related to the subject, and felt confident enough to make my first negotiated contract. I remember how nervous I was, made the deal, and the rest is history. I realized around the year of 2006 how Lazy local Realtors were. I realized that there were a lot of potential deals to be made because if the Realtors weren’t making deals with out of state people (trying to get listings) who was? Apparently no one. My first independent job was working with Daniel, buying crappy pieces of land, from the out of state owners, and reselling to local California folks, at higher prices. Back then people were lending their money everywhere so that’s where we got our start up money. It was a good way to get into the business because we were putting extremely low amounts of money up, and getting a fair share back. Of course those days are over, however Daniel and I have still continued to find more and more areas of interest that other people just don’t seem to follow up on. As a team, we work out very well, because we both excel in different areas that the other person may not be good at. Its nice to have started from scratch together. That way, in time, we can go back and look at all the business & financial struggles we’ve come across together as a young couple.

20090307095749AA5WGCx	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook "online friends" problem?	Last summer I went on a school trip to France and it was my school and another school from MA (I live in NC).  After 2 weeks of the trip I became good friends with some people from MA.  I just recently got a Facebook to talk to them and to keep in touch with my friends (shouldve gotten one earlier xD).      Here's my problem though.  Sometimes you just know somebody is online because they comment on things and it says "4 seconds ago" but yet I open the "online friends (X)" and he/she is not up there.  We talked through personal messages which is way slower and I want to chat instead.  Any suggestions what is happening?  Can they block me somehow?  I don't think they would but its weird since they are the only ones I don't see.      Help me out here.  Thanks in advance.

20090307122022AA3yusE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	Options to connect my new HDTV (Sony EBR6)to my desktop computer.?	(My PC is in one room, and the new TV is 30 feet away in another room.)      As I understand it, I could make the connection by buying a new router/modem to which I would connect my new tv using an ethernet cable as well as my old PC using its "old" cable.  In this way, I would end up with essentially 2 monitors working through one PC.      Or,      I suppose I could locate a new CPU near the new tv and connect them to a new router, essentially creating a home network.      If these are in fact the 2 options, I'd appreciate your advice on the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 approaches.   Any thoughts?      (I should add that we live in a bungalow with an unfinished basement so wiring through the floor and basement ceiling is relatively simple.)

20090307132031AAYmzfv	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook being annoying. help?	Ok, so when im on facebook, about one in two times when i want to update my status/comment on anything, i would click Comment or Confirm or something else (depending on what it is), and the page starts to load, but never comes, after about 2 minutes still nothing. Even if i press "Stop"  (the red X on firefox next to refresh), and then click on something else, that doesn't load either, and i cant get back onto facebook unless i close firefox then open it again and go back onto facebook. This has been happening for a few days now, and its really starting to annoy me.      I have 20meg broadband which is the top 2% in the country, and my internet is working fine on everything else, i hugely doubt my pc has a virus since i scanned it just a few days ago and there isn't any other symptoms for a virus. I also clear my browser cache etc. whenever i close firefox, and like i said, the speed has been exactly the same on all other sites.       Is anyone else experiancing this in the UK, or know if its just me and what i could do?      Thanks

My MSN messenger was phished ( I think) and/or has a virus, and not only is it sending links to my friends (which is, I'm guessing, how I got this in the first place) every time I try to talk to someone, it closes the window after a few seconds of having it open. Most of the articles on the internet that I've read already have only talked about the links being sent to friends and said all they have to do it change their password and question, which i have done already. I even made a new account, thinking that would work, but apparently not. So if anyone has ANY advice for me, PLEASE SHARE IT.

20090307144005AAXjFop	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Youtube partner questions?	Hey, I'm Chris, and I'm considering applying for youtube partnership in another month or two.       http://www.youtube.com/user/MChammer4u       The only problem is, I used to have a lot of views since i used to spam advertise, but now, I've got a lot of haters and reporters, so I'm not doing that anymore. Now, I'm just relying on forwarding videos. So now, I have about 200 views per video(about 7 of them). But for my other 50 videos, I have thousands of views.      I have some questions about the youtube partnership program:   1. 3 of my videos have copyrighted material. I have parts of about 6 songs in my newest video, one whole song in another video, and a song cover. Will that be too much copyrightment to be accepted? If it is, tell me which one I should delete.   2. If I only have around 200 views for my newest videos, but about 5k-40k views on my other 50 videos, will that be too little to be accepted?   3. How many subscribers do I really need if I have a lot of views like 40,000? Cause right now, I have almost 500 subscribers. Do I need a lot more?

20090307144047AAvc4yj	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Reformatting Acer laptop with recovery CD?	Hey, I just ordered an Acer system recovery CD so I can reformat my laptop. I'm a college student, so I could have it done at my university's tech center. But I'm wondering how difficult it is--can I safely attempt it myself? I'm fairly computer literate but hardly a programmer or expert or anything. Do I just pop in the recovery CD and it will walk me through the reformatting process? Will the system recovery CD include my OS, or is that something I need to get at the tech center (since I don't have it on a disk)? Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
