I am wondering what the difference is between them and which would be best for panic attacks? I have taken both and cannot tell much difference.       My doctor prefers tranxene because he says it stays in your system longer and has a mild anti-depressant in it. Yet most people I know use Zanax for this purpose. Does anyone know the difference between these drugs and which if best? Or for what purpose each is prescribed?

20090219130813AAcmYBd	Health;Women's Health	Disgusting question about spot down "there"?	Ok basically a few days ago i found what only can be described as a raised red spot down "there". It wasnt exactly near my vag!na, but slightly to the side of it, on the under surface. I thought it was just a little stupid spot that would go away, but the past few days it has been getting bigger and more painful...it feels almost like a bruise to touch, and it quite sore when my underwear rubs off it. It was quite sore last night, so i put some aloe vera gel on it before i went to bed to soothe it. Then this morning when I was going to the toilet i decided to take a look at how it was (sorry this is gona sound gross...) and as i pulled the skin so I could see better, the "spot" burst and a thick creamy pus came out. It wasnt just like a usual bit of white pus that wud come out of a spot on your face, it was actually quite alot!! There also was slightly blood stained...      Does anyone have any idea what it could be, where it has came from, or what will make it go away?      I do apologise for how disgusting that sounds.. but I thought I better ask people I dont know, therefore I cant be embarrased :)      Little bit of background info incase you need it...im 23, and the day before this spot appeared i "trimmed" down there with scissors... and that night my boyfriend went down on me, and f!ngered me. If any of that could have contributed to it? Oh and i have never slept with my bf.      All suggestions welcome... and please try be serious   Thanks in advance :)

Just wondering if its something serious to rush and check out - as i've only had it today.      My period finished just this time last week - and last night I woke up with severe stomach pain, but it felt so much like really bad period pains. Did the usual to try get rid of them as if they were period pains, but soon wore myself and fell asleep with it again. I then had flash pains throughout the day - and then when I went to the toilet again (I've been loads today) it was really bad, as it really crunching period pain where you just cant move. Lasted prob a min, but felt like forever.      I've been referred to a gyno for bad period pains (not as bad as these) a couple of weeks ago, and he's got some meds ready for my next period and only advised to take them then as he's just testing to see if I'm getting stronger contractions than normal, before looking for the endometraosis (sp?). And I've had swabs, and scans recently and all clear.               So basically, I'm just seeing if you've had anything similar, and if it turned out serious or something?

20090219141256AAuO4TO	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you think my diet is okay or should I change it?	Okay I don't know if my diet is okay, I don't want to lose weight even though sometimes I feel really fat but I want to gain muscle I'm sick of being called small.   I've just turned 13 years old and I'm 156 cms tall (short I know!) and I weigh 6 stone (sometimes I feel like that is a lot) ... I did two different BMI calculators both from the NHS, on one of them it says my BMI is healthy, but on the other one it says I'm underweight. My BMI is around 15.61!   The thing is, is that I feel I eat too much unhealthy stuff, my metabolism is good so that's why I don't put on much weight. I feel uncomfortable with my weight sometimes I feel fat really fat and unhealthy.    I know my weight is probably okay, but why do I feel unhealthy?   I want to put on muscle because I get teased for being small and it really annoys me! I don't want to have lots of muscle I just want to get out of this weak body of mine.   Okay, now to my diet - I'm vegetarian so I don't eat meat or fish! I eat a lot, I need to eat more calcium I'm not growing at all! I hate egg, cheese and lentils (stuff like that) I only like cheese on pizza or pasta and I only like egg in egg fried rice.   Because I'm so picky, no wonder I'm small..   I never eat breakfast, on school days I feel sick in the mornings. I have late lunch at around 1 but I normally have snacks like toast. For lunch I normally have something like homemade soup, toast, riveta or a toastie. For tea I normally have something like quorn, pasta bake, a healthy chinese, baked potato (I eat the skin) etc but for the past week it's been quick stuff like pasta and stone baked garlic bread because my brother's friends have been around.   I don't get much exercise because I don't get out much. But when I do get out I normally skateboard for about 5 hours which is like twice a week.   Is my diet alright?   Should I change it, if so then how?   What can I eat for my calcium and iron?   What drinks should I drink?   I know there's a lot of questions there but if you could answer at least one then thanks!   Rhiannon!

I'm also wanting to shed a few pounds, if I work out 5 times a week for 1-2 hours, how much is a realistic amount to lose in a month? I'm really wanting to try it.

Do full-on cardio for 45 minutes and end with anaerobic exercises? I use an elliptical machine, I believe. And I use small weights and do crunches.      2. Do cardio for 20 minutes, do some curls with small weights and crunches for 20 minutes, do cardio again for another 20 minutes, and end with more weight lifting/crunches?      Or maybe you have a better combination, or something?   Is it even beneficial to do anaerobic exercise when trying to lose weight?      Someone told me that I should do anaerobic first to burn glycogen, and then do cardio to burn fat. But I don't even know what that means. Shed some light?

I do like my body, but would like a more toned stomach. My stomach is alright, it just sticks out a little instead of being flat. (and the little bit sticks out more and more as I eat throughout the day which drives me crazy!) So, I've been doing an ab exercise like this every day:             I hang from a pull up bar and SLOWLY lift up my legs to my chest. I can really feel my abs working, and I do that 15 times, 2 times a day. (morning and night)   I've also started rollerskating around my subdivision everyday after school for about an hour and a half at a good speed.      With those two excersises everyday, do you think I will be able to achieve a nicer body with a toned stomach?      thank you soooo much for your answers!      p.s.

I wonder if perhaps this is just because i'm a grade above where i should be ... therefore, literally every girl i have any classes with tend to be a year or two older than i am. but, it bothers me a little bit, you know.? i mean ... like i said, i don't care too, too much because i know it doesn't matter in the end ... though to say i care not would be hypocritical. but, will i grow more, particularly in the chest area.? i'm just wondering ... it's not that i'm flat-chested, because there is some there & i'm about a 34 - 36B, but it just feels like they look so much smaller, you know.? maybe it's just an insecurity due to everyone else around me ... but, i'd just like to know if they're going to grow much more, based on my age. thanks :]

I am 14 years old, and for about 2 years now, I've had two things that we're kind of like attacks. the first time I had intense pain whenever I was standing up, underneath my ribcage, it was sort of an achy, sticky burning pain. my doctor said I might have had Pancreatitis, but didn't really do anything about it because it didn't last very long.   then last month I got the same thing but the pain was more severe, i went to the emergency room because i couldn't even stand because the pain was so bad, but they couldn't find out what it was, so they sent me home and the pain went away gradually, today I'm getting the same pains but much less pain, but I'm very nervous that i'm going to have one of these horrible attacks again! does anyone know what's causing this?   or how to get rid of it?   i had kidney cancer when I was 6 years old and I only have one kidney left, it also left me with radiation indused IBS, if that helps.

I have been having right side abdominal pain for over a year now, and it has progressively gotten worse. When it gets really bad, i also spike a fever. Recently, it has also been having spasms where it "rumbles & vibrates", it almost feels like something is about to explode. the pain is severe, and it is like tearing and throbbing, it's very hard to explain the sensation. any advice would be greatly appreciated. i have been to many different doctors, and they can find nothing. i also have a history of gastric ulcers and severe food allergies...i don't know if that has anything to do with this.my bowels are normal. and i eat very healthy (i'm under a dietician). it's really acting up right now and it also hurts to walk and move or do anything, i have a fever of 101.5. help please. like i said, i have been to many doctors, and have many tests done (most of which were performed a year ago) and everything has come back seemingly normal, but now it's so much worse. like i feel like im going to throw up i just feel horrible. help! i have been avoiding all of the foods that i am allergic to so i don't think that that has anything to do with my side pain. i have also get hives/rash when it hurts really bad. they are just red spots that aren't really raised. i also have poor circulation, and my legs are almost purple, but i'm not overweight at all!   i am a 16 year old female, and i have had sonograms, x-rays, blood work, ct scan. most of which were over a year ago, and it's getting progressively worse. but the docs say that it doesn't have anything to do with my cycle. oh and i've also had 2 endoscopys for my gastric ulcers that were caused by food allergies, but since i have kept the offending foods out of my diet, the ulcers have gone away. so, i don't think that this contributes to my side pain. i really would like to get to the bottom of this, i have some more doctors appointments, but they are giving up as well. i can barely sleep the pain is so bad. i can barely walk, and when i do i walk with a limp cuz i can't put full pressure on my right leg (same side as the abdominal pain). the pain is like parallel to my belly button, not right by my ribs though, it's kinda between my rib and pelvic bone, more so right in the part where there are no bones. but if it was appendecitis, wouldn't they have found something by now?

I'm assuming my nose is broken cos i didnt have that bump when i was younger, it kind of developed after that accident.

And if it is broken, my symptoms aren't huge so if i want to fix it, would a healthcare card cover the costs at all?

20090220081651AAWummS	Health;Diet & Fitness	How effective is the treadmill for weight loss?	I am trying to lose 30-35 pounds and it is really hard for me.   I am pretty lazy. I have been trying to run on my treadmill everyday but it has not been going so well.   I usually just jog/speed walk on 4.0...since I am new to working out. I do this for about a hour.   Would it be more effective for weight loss if I just stopped being so lazy and only ran for twenty minutes on a higher speed like 5.5-6.0?   I just ordered Turbo Jam. I talked to a few people and they said that the dvds were a good work out. Anyone ever try them?   Also I have had pillates dvd sitting in my room for years. Would they be beneficial to my weight loss?   I am 150 pounds and I am trying to lose 30pounds by June.
20090220081727AAhb45S	Health;Dental	Tooth abscess or Sinus problem?	Story about my front tooth: I had an accident and knocked it in nearly 20years ago. The tooth came out of it's socket but was pushed back in. It's discolored, but hasn't caused me grief.        About 3 weeks ago I went to the dentist with a toothache on my front tooth. There was a small pocket of fluid above my front tooth. Straight away he thought it was an abscess. He then took a x-ray but found no infection. He then said it was a sinus problem. He then prescribed me anti-biotics incase the problem gets worse. Next day I'm in real pain so i go grab them. A day later my front lip swells up, and the pain comes and goes (prob when the paracetamol fades). 5 days later I'm almost finished and now there is a pea sized bubble on my gums, but no pain. I ring the densist back but he is not free to see me. He then prescribes a repeat of penicillin. couple of days later it's all good. Finish that lot, with the fluid still there, but very small. 5 days later and the fluid is back... pain hasn't arrived yet. It's the weekend now and almost impossible to get to see a densist on such short notice. I'm not sure what to do.

Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same,They are very comfortable money wise and are so stuck up im not like them at all. They tell me i could do so much better but i absolutely love him. I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ended up putting his fist through the wall. He snapped at me the other night during sex, again i just walked away. We don't fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him.

I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?

Hi - I have been doing good intense workout for 6 months now and on a proper diet with atleast 100 gms protein intake each day ( I weigh 140 lbs). However, I do not see further progress after the initial 'beginners gain'.    Have tried it all - change of exercises, weight increment, reps increment.    I have been having nerve issue right from the start and it gets aggravated on the second day following my workout day.   Now my muscle strength has infact reduced since last 2 months due to nerve pain. My sleep is disturbed and I wake up with numbness and pain in arms. Is it possible that my muscle growth is halted due to trapped nerve ?

20090220090137AAXHArK	Health;Alternative Medicine	Help! Baby with severe reflux!?	Hi, I have a beautiful 2-month old baby who was diagnosed with severe reflux. His pediatrician prescribed zantac, but that has not helped much. We switched to a hipoallergenic formula (Similac Alimentum) and although he was no longer having horrible episodes of reflux, the taste of the formula is so horrible he would eat only 1/3 of what he used to. I called the pediatrician, who told me to mix the formula he likes (Similac Sensitive) with the hipoallergenic one. My son is eating better, but his reflux came back with a vengeance. My pediatrician said there is little he could do and we should wait until he 'grows out of it". I can't just sit there and see by baby crying in pain.       Any parents who have been through the same? What did you do? Is there something that worked for you? I do not want to medicate my child!

20090220090204AAs64Ef	Health;Women's Health	Missing Periods and Not Pregnant?	My girlfriend has missed her last two periods.  She took a pregnancy test and it came up negative.  She then went to the doctors and had a urine test - also negative.  Finally she had a blood test and this came up negative for pregnancy and showed nothing else unusual.  The doctors have since stopped being helpful or concerned and have sent her on her way, but she is worried about her continued lack of periods.        I have done some looking up for possible causes and have found that the medication she takes for her Bi-Polar (Olanzipine) has a listed side effect of sometimes stopping periods.  I think that this is the most likely cause of the problem, but not being an expert I can't say for sure.      Anyway, my questions:      Is there a risk that Olanzipine could have a permanent effect on her ability to have children and could there be any other cause for her missing periods?

20090220090436AAo1ObI	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Does this sound like Type 1 Diabetes to you?	For the last 6-8 weeks I have been experience more frequent than normal urination coupled with a total extreme thirst. No matter how much I drink it is never enough. My urine has also had a bit of an odour. I tried taking cranberry tablets but these had no effect on my urine what so ever.      Over this time period I have also had some blurring of my vision. I went to the optometrist for a check up and had my prescription updated however the blurred vision has been rather random and not just concentrated around times when I should be wearing glasses, like reading.      Prior to all these symptoms occurring I had a urinary tract infection for the first time and for the past 6-8 weeks have been experiencing clitoral discomfort, which was diagnosed as something sex related but I feel that diagnosis is very very wrong as I have absolutely no other symptoms to support that diagnosis. I have read that this can also be a symptom of Type 1 Diabetes.      I am 25 years old.

I want to start to increase my intake of protein and calories for a few weeks before i start lifting weights. Does anyone have any advice? I dont have the money to get a trainer but I can afford to spend money on whey proteins and vitamins etc I just dont even begin to know what to buy and Im sure as with EVERYTHING it comes down to personal preference. So as opposed to reading ads from competitors who all say they are they best, I would rather have everyday people with everyday knowledge share their ideas. Im not looking to bulk up and rip my tee shirt but I most certainly am ready to hit it hard and put on some muscle mass (If that makes any since!! lol ) So any ideas from      :How many reps of what weights   :What protein shakes powders or gels people think are the best   :What mulitvitamins should i be eating   :as well as what are good foods to carry with me ie. peanuts etc.. that i can have a constant protein enriched snack to eat on throughout the day.       thanks ahead of time for your answers and I look forward to hearing about what real people NOT ADVERTISERS say works the best :)

I have been for about 4-5 years had a slight sensation, more of a just very faint pressure about 1-2 in down under right breast and it kinda flows around to side, well past couple of months it seems to be more burning sensation, and occasionally like i have a pin pokin me in side. Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again. Thanks so much.

I read in the internet that cooked carrot can also cause constipation. So my baby is now almost breastfeeded again and eating only pears and little barley cereal.

I have a therapist, but I don't feel any great changes.    Recently, I've been to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro..I am very much apposed to meds and their side effects..   Can you please tell me your experience w/ this drug?   Do the benefits outweigh the disadvantages?   thank you so much..I really need help making this decision!

I gave him a copy of this but I wrote out a whole lot more additional information since i asked this.    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...       He asked me to look on the internet for help. I said I wanted to see someone about it face to face. And he said that you have to have a good reason for why you want to see a psychiatrist. So I said I wanted to have my progress monitered. So then he agreed. But why would he refuse initially? I always feel that my problems are undermined as normal and okay. But to me they are making my life a living hell and I want to get out of this rut.
20090220011139AAYJzR7	Health;Mental Health	What is all this psychiatric nonsense really?	The psychiatric sciences.... are pretty much a giant gamble...      SOO...      why do people claim to know more than others about all the various "disorders" and "afflictions" of the mind? People get all weird over this stuff..... I dunno why :P There is much rhetoric and one-up-man-ship in the psychiatric field... it seems patients are LEFT IN THE DUST :P      I think........      If people were just more open with each other... and said more of the things going through their minds... there would be no mental illness... since no one would have to be shamed of their thought processes and people's facades of perfection would come crashing down.      It is so much easier to live in a world where EVERYONE is a screw-up... then you don't feel so damned alone :D      WHAT... has been your impressions of this psychiatry "business"? since verily, it is quite the profitable enterprise :D

20090220005837AAY3g0H	Health;Mental Health	Is there such a thing as roid rage, or is it hormonal? I'm not on steroids, but seem to be experiencing it?	People often say roids will give you roid rage etc. but isn't this "rage", hormonal? ie. bound in testosterone etc.? In which case, will someone with a high hormone level be more proneto aggression?      I just started lifting weights again and lately I've noticed that I tend to get very easily annoyed, and I also feel a certain kind emotion and irritation I would characterize as "rage", over situations that normally would not bother me. I am a very mellow and easy going person, who has struggled with suppressing emotion and turned to eating. Now that I'm no longer overeating, and working out a lot, I feel a tremendous anxiety and tension that I do not care for at all.      Something also happened yesterday, without going into too much detail, with a situation in which I felt extremely unfairly treated, which just has my blood absolutely boiling.      Do I need to see my doctor about this? Or will it pass? Or are all these hormones which are now bobbling around my system (previously I was very sedentary) a natural reaction I simply need to learn to control?      I should say that my last bloodtest showed my testosterone, TSH, and hGh were almost off the chart (where as previously they were artificially low due to my extreme sleep apnea breaking my endocrinetic system) Do I need to be medicated to bring them down?

20090220114849AA1tvb5	Health;Mental Health	Will my GP give me antidepressants?	About three weeks ago I went to the doctor out of desperation because I was feeling so down, and she went through the things that can be done, like tablets and counselling. So she referred me for CBT so we can try that before anti-depressants. The thing is, it could be months before I get the CBT.   At the moment I would describe my feelings as flat, unmotivated, irritable, lethargic, like there is no point in anything anymore. I'm tired of life and I don't want to do all these things anymore. Big problem is that I'll be starting uni next year but the way I am feeling is effecting my schoolwork so I'm scared I'm going to miss my grades.   If I made another appointment with my doctor would she get irritated, or is there something she can do whilst I'm waiting for CBT? It's not that I WANT to be on medication, I just wondered if there is a chance she would prescribe me tablets in the meantime.

Since I am the only one he has had sex with, it probably has a lot to do with inexperience.  He blames it on a problem he had as a child where one of his testicles sucked into his abdomen and he had to have shots to drop it back down.  We try the squeeze technique all the time to no avail.  We'd really like to have sex that lasts awhile for more intimacy and enjoyment.  We've been together over three years, so it's getting a little old.  At least we can enjoy awesome foreplay.

20090220065841AAZH1MN	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to deal with arthritis, overweight, and overall poor health?	My mother has bad arthritis which is really painful on her fingers, neck and back, and knees. I think the only relief she gets is when my dad or I massage or pound her back and legs (gently) to ease up the blood flow (she complains her circulation is not good),       Having the constant pain for many years has made her quite depressive and its hard sometimes because she started working as a real estate agent and has to work everyday. I really want to make the arthritis just disappear but I dont know how to help.      She is about 170 lbs and 43 years old. At 5'3" that is quite overweight, she used to be 115 lbs and was always a slim woman until marriage.       Because  of her knees its impossible to run in the mornings. We have a pool but she can't swim, but we want to try that when the weather gets warmer.       Otherwise, what are good exersizes to lose weight if you have bad knees?      Also can you reccommend any remedies, lifestyle habits, or medical treatments to relieve arthritis?       She also has slight asthma and recently (past 3 years) developed a kind of claustrophobia which can be problematic in the car. I think her health is really not doing well due to overload of stress, family problems, and being overweight. Please if you have any suggestions or you went through a similar experience tell me and hopefully I can help her somehow.      -arthritis and rheumatism   -stress   -anxiety and difficult interpersonal relationships   -overweight   -amnesia, can't sleep at night   -asthma   -had Cesarean sections when having children, twice   -premature aging and feels weak all the time

I am not quite sure as too what is goin on with me, all I know is I am starting to panic real bad and I am holding it in so my kids wont see. I have been for about 4-5 years had a slight sensation, more of a just very faint pressure about 1-2 in down under right breast and it kinda flows around to side, well past couple of months it seems to be more burning sensation, and occasionally like i have a pin pokin me in side. Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again. Thanks so much.   Ive had ekgs also and they were normal, I keep thinking intestines or colon im not really sure, just want piece of mind.

Other then that.. most people can't really tell. I exercise about 2 times a week, nothing heavy and i waitress 5 days 30 hrs a week so im always on my feet.

She has been a writer since she was a child. She had spent several years working on one story and she went to write a sequel to it. This person in the book "died." She said it alarmed her because she didn't plan it and she was disturbed by the fact that it seemed like the story had decided all by itself how it was going to turn out. She was very traumatized by the death of this "person" and hasn't written in two years. She has some symptoms of Ptsd when she thinks about it. She was a writer with a gift and she doesn't want to give that up. She wants to get back into it but ever since she's been feeling like this "person" is a ghost. It bothers her a lot of the time and knows deep inside he's not real but she lets herself believe it sometimes. She gets so lonely sometimes she has told me she wanted to die. She intends to get help sometime soon in the next year or so but she's waiting to be able to drive w/ a full licence, etc. I don't know if she will be able to let this go. I want her to but I don't know if she can. I know it sounds silly but it is VERY real to her and it scares her. This "ghost" gives her impressions and she feels like he does not want her to let him go. It scares me because I don't rightly know what's going on. What is this problem associated with? why did it happen?

Can;t always keep track of what should and shouldn't take with what....

After many trial and error episodes I finally have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder and I'm having a hard time coping with it. I just don't like to think that my life is dependent on medication. Right now I am on Depakote ER and as soon as that blood work comes back she will decide to either keep me on this, or switch me to Seroquel. Anyone been on either with success?      I guess my main question is, I have a ton of killer anxiety and she is not prescribing me any more benzos because I have an addictive personality so I was wondering what are some natural ways to ease anxiety? I'm also currently tapering off Effexor XR (which is what sent me into a horrible manic episode). Currently I'm at 75mg a day but tomorrow I start the 3 days of 37.5mg then nothing after that.

Ok, go ahead, make fun of me, I still am hot and funny.  I would put a picture up of me but I don't know how.      Anyway, I really want to lose weight.  I do not have a healthy lifestyle.  For example, yesterday I ate a buffalo chicken wrap for lunch, and chips and salsa and popcorn for dinner.  I am not in denial.  I know I eat ****.  This is why I am definitely willing to change my habits, if it means that I feel better and lose more weight.  I want to enter my adulthood being in anywhere less then 185 lbs, and then stay there.      Because, while 185 is still fat, I am one good looking fat person.  I know, it is rare, but I would rather be a good looking person, then a good looking fat person.      So basically, I am asking a lot.  Can someone who has lost weight before, or knows how to lose weight over a few months, write me up a Diet and Exercise plan for the next few months.  I promise to follow it completely, and will update yo on my progress.  I know that is asking much, but I come from a family of overweight people, and I am hoping to be the exception, and hopefully help my family too.      So can someone please write me up a Diet and Exercise plan for the next few months.  Thank you so much.      Jacob

But me and my boyfriend have fingered and stuff.    Anyway, my last period was Feb. 11th.  About the week that I was supposed to have my period, I had some chunky black, really really dark brown stuff for like two days.  I don't know if that was supposed to be a period.. or what?  We fingered three times between feb. 11th and when my next period was due.    So I pretty much skipped that period, i think.  And wednesday was when I was supposed to be due for my next period, but so far hasn't come.  I don't have sore boobs or anything either yet.  A few days ago, I had some cramps, but they were more like sharp pains.    What should I do?  I've nver been totally regular, but I do'nt usually skip periods and such.  Should I take a test? Or what?

20090220013433AAWydZK	Health;Mental Health	My son has a very strange/serious problem that i have never heard of or encountered before, help?	First off, this is NOT a joke.  Recently, I've been noticing that every time my son gets angry (I am the father), he starts to yell at his anus.  Strange as it is (and as much as I tried to pass it off), I had the last straw during his baseball game two days ago.  After striking out, he became so flustered that he curled both legs behind his back and started screaming vulgar profanities at his anus, all in the middle of the ball game!  "You Bit**, You Bit**, this is all YOUR fault" he kept on saying.  He then started fingering his rectum vigorously. I think this may have something to do with his girlfriend breaking up with him last week, but im not sure.  Im really scared for him but I don't want to consult a doctor just yet.  I have been the boys father for 14 years and nothing like this has ever happened before.
20090220020709AALGmOb	Health;Mental Health	My fear of the dark and wild imagination is ruining my life!?	I can't sleep without my light on, and sometimes I can't even sleep with that. It causes terrible anxiety and I worry about so many other things in my life. I get terrible anxiety symptoms such as shaking, my vision causing me havoc and an intense feeling of fear. I also wonder and tell myself that there is something at the end of my bed standing over me. It makes my legs shake, and because my mattress is not very sturdy it feels like that is shaking near my legs too. I know it isn't the mattress because when I move my legs or lift them off my mattress, my legs shake but the mattress stops. Sometimes it even happens during the day, whenever I'm relaxing or resting for a long period of time. I also flip out when I hear a noise at night. I sometimes think I hear very subtle noises then I realise I haven't. This always seems to flair up in the holidays or at the weekends when my mind isn't occupied. Should I find something to occupy my mind and then try to calm my imagination?
