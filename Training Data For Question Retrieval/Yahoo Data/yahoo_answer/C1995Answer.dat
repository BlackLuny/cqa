JEyoIEhqaa	Its really up to you weather or not your going to use CD players or turntables i prefer turntables so i can get that authentic feel. You definately need a mixer. Avoid any mixer that is really cheap in price, they tend to have problems very quickly. Rane is the best but your gonna pay. Also i would seriously get serato. Serato is the number 1 product DJ's are using right now, it can be used with CD players or turntables but you need a good laptop to run it. If you go with turntables you need Technic 1200's if you go with cd players you need pioneer CDJ's.
bDyXKNpsaa	yes, when you get a prepaid phone they don't do any kind of credit check and it doesn't even have to have a name on it. All that you do is go somewhere that sells them (ex: Target) and choose a phone and a minute card, very easy to do. You can also choose whatever company you want from Verizon to T-mobile and so on. Just FYI sprint owns the virgin mobile and boost so you may not want one of them if you dislike sprint|`|EyOAc9mnaa	Yes you can It just so happens that I have 3 prepaid phones for sale. All on VirginMobile. 1 is a camrea , the two others are not. If you want them all i'll sell them to you.<br>  Write me back at<br>  <br>  winkeydawg@yahoo.com|`|rbNfhyoDaa	Yes You definetly can get a prepaid without it affecting your credit or previous outstanding bill.

There is no customer support number you can call either.  The whole company is corrupt and I despise it.

Lol. In all honesty Ryan, great question. I'll tackle each separately:<br>  <br>  1. How Does It Work?<br>  <br>  A simple way to understand it would be to think of wireless broadband (WiFi for example) like a cordless phone. It's good for around the house. Mobile broadband, however is like your cell phone. Good just about any and everywhere.<br>  <br>  2. High Speed on the Road?<br>  <br>  AT&T's coverage for wireless internet is best in urban areas. They advertise coverage in the 'top 300 cities' of the United States. In these places, you can expect 3G mobile broadband speeds. If you are traveling between cities on the interstate, you may connect to their EDGE network at times. This will feel like its somewhere between a slow DSL and dialup. Mostly though, it will be GPRS (read snail dialup speed).<br>  <br>  3. How much per month?<br>  <br>  AT&T's Wireless Internet pricing (marketed as DataConnect for Laptops) is on par with the industry standard of about $60 per month.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Which PC Card?<br>  <br>  There are 3 categories (USB, ExpressCards and PC Broadband Cards). Each gets compared side-by-side. See which card fits your needs based on:<br>  <br>  1. Network<br>  2. Speed<br>   3. Operating System Compatibility<br>  4. Extra Features<br>  5. Price<br>  <br>  Best place to do it is in the sources. #4 is a Broadband Card Comparison. Pretty thorough.

4TW5Ngetaa	il 25 settembre, per la precisione alle sei di mattina qui da noi scaricheremo dal marketplace questo innovativo e corposo aggiornamento; con una copertura dal vivo dell'evento da parte di G4, con un countdown da parte di Microsoft a partire da 5 ore prima. Per l'occasione il canale dovrebbe anche essere disponibile in streaming per tutti gli utenti Live. In concomitanza con il lancio della nuova dashboard dovrebbero inoltre arrivare tre nuove pagine per la dashboard: nel corso dell'evento live infatti, Microsoft dovrebbe annunciare una partnership con Sirius Satelite Radio: per una modesta quantità (mensile) di Microsoft Points, gli utenti Live (quantomeno quelli americani) avranno così la possibilità di ascoltare la radio senza bisogno di hardware aggiuntivi e anche durante i giochi. La seconda pagina dovrebbe essere un music store per scaricare musica direttamente sull'hard disk di Xbox 360 in cambio di MP, ovviamente. La terza misteriosa pagina si intitolerebbe mad lib e sembra possa essere collegata ad una sorta di funzione picture-in-picture, ma non si sa altro a riguardo. Dal lato giochi inoltre, la manifestazione culminerà con il lancio di una dozzina di demo, una nuova espansione di Mass Effect, un map pack gratuito di Halo 3, l'arrivo del nuovo Portal e quattro video di anteprima per i contenuti scaricabili di GTA IV. Non solo, sei titoli Xbox Originals verranno offerti gratuitamente: tre saranno giochi non presenti in catalogo, mentre dei tre già presenti uno dovrebbe essere Halo. Dulcis in fundo, Microsoft dovrebbe fare il botto annunciando ben dodici titoli mai annunciati prima: tra questi si vociferano due nuovi titoli del franchise Halo (l'Halo 4 di Gearbox e il progetto Peter Jackson?), Mass Effect 2, Assassin's Creed 2, un nuovo titolo di Conker e la nuova IP per uno shooter di Rare. Sottolineiamo che la notizia, seppur stracolma di dettagli concreti, è puramente un rumor incontrollato, per cui prendetelo come tale e con tutte le cautele del caso. Certo è che se fosse tutto confermato, fra un paio di settimane ci sarebbe un gran bel po' di materiale nuovo buttato in pasto agli utenti Xbox 360. Non ci resta che attendere.|`|e5T1xYVBaa	tu sei un grande. e spero per te che la data sia giusta! anche se non so di cosa parli.|`|QkECtOUNaa	non lo so, non sapevo manco dell'aggiornamento, so solo che mi dispiace per il fatto che l'xbox ce l'ho in assistenza.

wL9OyMK9aa	I've only played Mass Effect once through, but I know that if you start a new game with an old character, you keep the weapons and gear, but your reputation is reset. I can't find a very good source, but I came across a post from the Mass Effect forums that mentioned this (see below).<br>  <br>  As for changing your reputation, just do (and say) bad things to get to ruthless and do (and say) good things to get to paragon. Also, I finished by saving the Council, and **SPOILER AHEAD** they reward you by allowing humans into the Council (as opposed to humans simply taking control).

Then i use Videora Ipod converter to convert it in to the right media type. Once you have the programs which are free and have done it a couple of times it is easy.  On my laptop you can do the rip while using the converter as the disc does not need to be in the machine as a form of the dvd is saved on the computer so if you get a little production line going you can get about 3 or 4 done in an hour.  As i say that is my laptop dependant on spec it may take longer.|`|sDhsujojaa	iPod touch can only accept H.264 and MPEG-4 videos.

Which version of the PS3 you have, and which game you are trying to play.<br>  <br>  The PS3 started with extra components, the PS2 hardware, built directly into the system.  Then they took out the PS2 hardware and just had an emulator stored on a static flash ram chip.  But to save money and change the Sony business model they took out backwards compatibility completely.<br>  <br>  If you have a 20GB or 60GB PS3 then you may just need to update your PS3 firmware.

yaabXccEaa	Q1: Just look at the control. Analog is best if you wanna run, and the directional button is walking. I guess you approached that terrorist with running using analog. The story is, that terrorist heard your footsteps. So he turned around and saw you. That's a whole story. To grab enemy from behind, simply walk with directional button when you're near 'em. Then press and hold circle button.<br>  Q2: Break necks? Well, do it when you grab them. Anyway, you slit throats if you hold that circle button too deep. Just don't press it with much energy. Hahaha... If you push it softly, snake won't kill it. To choke the enemy, press circle button repeatedly when grabbed. 5 chokes would confuse the enemy, 10 or more chokes would end his life.<br>  Q3: Well, if you used stealth item, it would be 100% hidden. And the enemy won't be able to see you wherever you are. I believe if you only use camouflage, the maximum percentage to be seen is 95%. That means the terrorist would alert you when he saw you very close.<br>  Q4: There's two way to get items from enemy. First, if you saw some dead or laying bodies, don't equip weapon or scope or etc (just with empty hand I mean), stand in front of the body, then press square button to shake him. Then the items out. Second, punch the enemy once with CQC with 1 combo, then when the enemy is down, point your gun at him. Then you will say freeze. He surrendered at the ground. Shoot beside him (exactly near miss shot) and he will show u an item.<br>  <br>  Try it!|`|HekFanRvaa	Metal gear is about sneaking mission. You are not suppose to kill enemies if not necessary. If they fire at you, that's the only time you should  fire back. But if you can get away from it to minimize killing enemies, then get away. You can't break necks. Just either put them to sleep or slash throat. <br>  You can be hidden by camouflage by choosing the right camo appropriate in a specific environment. Like you can't put on, say, a snow camo if you are in the woods. You can check the percentage of your visibility each time you put on a camo. But even if you are 0% visible, you should stay away from the enemy's path. If they walk straight to where you are, they will still see you.<br>  <br>  have fun..

Qt05jgD9aa	You may have done this already, but just in case...my Comcast cable modem will not restore to normal when I remove the incoming signal (like you did when you installed your splitter.)  I have to pull the power cord, wait a few minutes, then power it back up..  If you haven't tried that yet, give it a shot.  You may have to do the same with your router if you have one.
AKoAFbMsaa	yes it`s possible, in the windows media player in the tab "burn"  click the small arrow and choose audio CD, then make a play list by drug and drop the titles u wanna transfer. now all u have to do is to click the "start burn" button (sure a blank disc should be in the driver). this the simplest way, sure there is other software u can use like nero....

j5Apt8hWaa	While the 28-135 mm lens is a good one, it is designed for use with the full frame cameras like the EOS 35 mm and the 5D and 1D series DSLR's.<br>  <br>  What you need is the Canon 18-55 mm IS lens.  It will cover over 80% of your shooting needs ... add the 55-250 mm and you will have it covered including sports, action and wildlife|`|6nmdvdEraa	You should look at the 18 - 200 usm lens, Canon recently released it with the 50d. It is better to have one general lens that will cover a wide range of shots than to be swapping from one to another.
oEvHzaUPaa	You can connect 2 speakers to a single output of your receiver IF the speakers load does not go below what the receiver says it can handle. If the 2 speakers you are connecting each have an impedance of 4 ohms and you connect them in parallel (plus to plus, minus to minus) your receiver will see a load of 2 ohms. Most receivers cannot handle that low of a load and are rated at 4-16ohms. If you connect a 2 ohm load to your receiver and it says 4-16 ohms you can damage/destroy your amplifier section of your receiver by overheating it. You need to know 3 things<br>  1. The rated impedance of  each speaker.<br>  2. The acceptable load range of your receiver.<br>  3. The nominal power rating of each speaker.<br>  <br>  If each of your speakers is rated at 4 ohms you can connect them in series to show the reciever an 8 ohm load (plus to receiver, minus to plus of other speaker, minus of other speaker to reciever). If your speakers say they are 8 ohms then parallel would show the receiver a 4 ohm load (parallel halves the ohm load, series you add the ohm load) and this would fall in the limits of the 4-16 ohm range the receiver can handle. The nominal power rating of each speaker tells you, generally, how efficient that speaker is. If you connect 2 speakers together an 1 has a nominal rating of 10 watts and the other 20 watts then the 10 watt speaker will sound louder than the 20 watt as it's more efficient per watt of audio power. But by and large with speakers more is not generally better. Quality over quantity in this case.|`|AhKhQquEaa	go to best buy and get a splitter|`|bRJAqc8Baa	You receiver can only put out the same about of watts.  The more speakers you add the more diluted each speaker sounds.  What you are trying to do is technically possible, but not very logical.<br>  <br>  You will have diluted sound and maybe some blown speakers if the wrong wires touch.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend against it.   Your system will sound better as a 5.1 then it every would attempting to add two speakers to the same port, thus getting a "bootleg" 10.1.
Y7qLedwkaa	Skype requires an Internet connection to run, so it is either going thru your phone's Wifi (if your phone has wifi and you are around a wifi network), or you have a data package thru your cell phone provider. So, Skype doesn't use your cell phone minutes this way.<br>  <br>  The rates are standard skype rates, see their website.<br>  <br>  Without a data package you are better off using their Number to Go service as this option uses your cell phone minutes and not a data package.

TaxYLHbMaa	snag it can record the audio and video from games without having the speakers audio playing and the speakers turned off (but audio card active) this will assist whole heartedly what you are looking for<br>  to grab the audio alone will just be a drag and drop and save the capture to mp3

Theres a new disease going around, its called new age cancer and its the big boy in these parts of town. This things stronger, faster, deadlier, creepier, and blacker than any other kind. This thing is so powerful, it can tear peoples heads off, eat lava, kill ronoson chirogodas, nexus rape people, and even turn into a dragon. Now nexus rape is an entirely new different type of rape altogether. Nexus rape is when the rape victim becomes the rapist and the rapist becomes the rape victim. Usually when this happens, a super ape infects the rape in progress, and gives the rape victim an overwhelming amount of strength. They are actually able to turn the tables on their opponent, and have been known to grow 90 feet. The thing i would be really worried about is ronoson chirogodas, literally living gods. If i could tell you all the stuff ive been through because of these things..... Ronoson Chirgodas once infected the town i was living in, killed the entire population including mice. Ronoson chirogodas can not be killed, they can only be stopped. These things are stronger than adrenaline fueled cheetahs, and have been known to create super fighting television speakers. Super fighting television speakers have been known to make someone explode, and creates extreme russian jihads. One thing you should really be careful about is super arthritis, this stuff can literally make you fall apart. Another thing to worry about is ultra alzheimers, which is like alzheimers except it affects everyone from every age. Ultra alzheimers once made a man forget how to breathe, and he died a painful death. He fell on the floor saying why? The thing you should really, really be afraid of is mexican ronoson chirogodas, even stronger than ronoson chirogodas. Mexican ronoson chirogodas carry guns, and travel faster than the speed of light. Usually they reproduce about 900 a minute and can infect the entire population in mere seconds. So if i were you id think twice before asking questions.|`|1uoiXiCyaa	S4V4GE 007?

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The T2 is a point & shoot camera that does not have aperture or shutter priority modes, which means you cannot manually adjust the shutter speed and/or aperture.<br>  <br>  p.s. I have looked in your manual and you definitely cannot select your own shutter speed. You can however, raise the ISO. This will get the camera to use a faster shutter speed. In low light, noise will also be increased.<br>  You can also experiment by adjusting your exposure.<br>  <br>  Other than that, the only other option is to use one of the Scene modes (SCN). For instance, you can select 'Hi-Speed Shutter' if you want to try to capture fast moving subjects...the camera will select a faster shutter speed. This works best in bright outdoor lighting.<br>  Or for a longer exposure (slower shutter speed) for night time shooting, you can select 'Fireworks'.

Hat das Objektiv einen "Schu?" bekommen, wo angeschlagen ist ja gleich mal passiert, dann k?nnte es sein das der Blendenmechanismus h?ngt ... dann weiter Feuchtigkeit oder generll Staub im Objektiv, passiert bei h?ufigem Wechsel ... an der Kamera selbst liegt es seltenst, denn die Schützt sich durch Verweigrung des Dienstes selbst vor Schaden ..... Das mit dem Resett ist ansich ne gute Idee dazu aber unbedingt ALLE Battarien entfernen, auch die seperate für Datum und Firmware .... Sofern Du die Cam mit einem Originalobjektiv betreibst sollte ein Fehler durch nichtkompatible Hardware ausgeschlossen sein, den Fremdobjektive machen auch mal "Probleme" ...<br>  <br>  Wenn das alles nichts Helfen sollte, dann ist der Kundendienst gefragt ....

Ce capteur de 5 méga de pixels je crois, a été utilisé dans une grande partie d'apn mais aussi de caméscope numérique. (Je sais par exemple que l'olympus 5050 était touché).

For this process, you must have a computer with windows media player on it. It must be 11 or under.<br>  Plug the mp3 player in, then open the windows media player. One of the tabs should say Copy to Device, or Synchronize. You click on this tab. After this, you will see a drop down menu on the right side of the screen. Chose the one that has something to do with Removable E:/. There should appear to folders if this has worked correctly. RECORD and AUDIBLE. Click the + sign so it becomes a - in the RECORD folder.

I can get over 70 digital TV and radio stations perfectly.<br>  <br>  Chances are, as Al says, you are possibly in a poor reception area (only about 75% of the U.K. can currently get Freeview).  You may simply need a better aerial, rather than a nonexistent "digital" one.|`|AA11141136	You do need a decent aerial, for digital reception. Also, some areas have a poor signal. Many suggestions to consider on the web sites below, including trying another digi box(borrowed!), directly connected to the TV and aerial.

Especially popular in Europe, the two P2P networks eDonkey and Overnet combined support a large base of users and files. The eDonkey P2P client connects to both networks; the Overnet client is being merged into future releases of eDonkey. eDonkey runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers. The free version of eDonkey contains embedded advertising but none of the dreaded "spyware" found in some free file sharing software. <br>  2) Shareaza<a href="http://www.shareaza.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shareaza.com/</a><br>  Shareaza is an up-and-coming P2P file sharing program. This client offers an extremely powerful search engine capable of connecting to multiple popular P2P networks including eDonkey, BitTorrent and Gnutella. Shareaza file sharing software includes intelligence for detecting fake and/or corrupted files. The free Shareaza download also contains no ads or spyware. As the installed base of Shareaza client users grows, expect Shareaza to become an even better P2P file sharing program. <br>  3) WinMX<a href="http://www.topshareware.com/WinMX-download-13747.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.topshareware.com/WinMX-downlo...</a><br>  WinMX offers a large P2P file sharing network and a feature-rich client program that has evolved over years of development. True, WinMX has a reputation for being complex and more difficult to use than some alternatives. However, WinMX also provides power to users in managing their downloads, and it offers a wide selection of music (MP3) files. Some WinMX users report waiting in long queues to download popular files. WinMX software runs only on the Windows family of operating systems. <br>  4) BitTorrent<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittorrent.com/download</a><br>  BitTorrent is another free P2P software application. It has attracted a loyal following among those interested in sharing movies and television programs. The offical BitTorrent P2P client generally does not support bandwidth throttling, meaning that it will tend to monopolize a network connection and not allow surfing the Internet or otherwise utilizing the network while files are being downloaded or uploaded. A freely-available alternative BitTorrent client overcomes this limitation. <br>  5) Limewire<a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/download.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.limewire.com/english/content/...</a><br>  The Limewire P2P file sharing program connects to the Gnutella P2P network. Limewire client software is widely recognized for its clean user interface that does not contain adware. Sometimes billed as the "fastest file sharing program," Limewire claims to offer relatively good search and download performance. Free Limewire software downloads are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Limewire Pro pay clients also exist. <br>  6) Morpheus<a href="http://www.morpheus.com/download.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.morpheus.com/download.asp</a><br>  Morpheus P2P client application downloads exist in both free and paid Ultra versions. Compared to the free version, the Morpheus Ultra download additionally removes bundled advertising. Morpheus clients are capable of searching Gnutella2, FastTrack, eDonkey2K and Overnet P2P networks. <br>  7) eMule<a href="http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/general.cgi?l=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/g...</a><br>  The eMule project started with the goal of building an improved free eDonkey client. eMule has achieved a large user base, connecting both to the eDonkey P2P file sharing network and a few others. It contains no advertising, and its software base is well-maintained by an open source development team. The chief limitation of eMule's P2P file sharing program is its speed: eMule typically performs downloading much slower than other P2P clients. <br>  8) Ares<a href="http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  Ares is a full-featured free P2P network with its own file sharing programs including Ares Galaxy. Ares clients support decentralized music and other file sharing and include a built-in chat service. Ares strives to offer the simplicity of Kazaa clients with no adware and fast connection times. <br>  9) BearShare<a href="http://www.bearshare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bearshare.com/</a><br>  The BearShare P2P file sharing program is a popular free software client for the Gnutella P2P network. Both free and pay downloads of BearShare file sharing programs exist. <br>  10) Kazaa<a href="http://www.kazaa.com/us/products/downloadKMD.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kazaa.com/us/products/downloa...</a><br>  The Kazaa software family (including the Kazaa Lite family of applications) has been the single-most popular P2P file sharing program / system of all time. Kazaa is fast and easy to use. However Kazaa software and the FastTrack network it utilizes appear to be declining rapidly in popularity and availability of files. Some have criticized the intrusiveness of "adware" embedded in free Kazaa clients. Others have complained about the frequency of encountering fake files on FastTrack.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other alternatives<br>  <br>  Here are different programs for you to choose from:<br>  100% FREE

I bought a cable that has a firewire connector on one end and a USB connector on the other end. Just plug the firewire connector into the port on top of the PSP then your computer should see it as a removable drive. Then you just put whatever pics you want into your PSP's folder and you should be able to see them on the PSP's photo menu.

You can listen to the radio, and take voice recordings of up to 10 minutes each. It comes in 5 different colors and I think they're blue, green, white, black, and pink.

AbRfd29Haa	It actually could be your cable.. or your TV. <br>  <br>  1080/60i and 720/60p use the same data rate.. so if one of these works, there's no good explanation why the other would fail. <br>  <br>  But 1080/60p is at twice the data rate of 720/60p or 1080/60i. It's quite believable that something in your system has a problem with that increase.. it's like running your PC at twice it's standard clock rate... unless it's speced to run at that speed, don't be surprised it if fails. <br>  <br>  The PS3 does 1080p just dandy. Mine is connected via a $25 HDMI cable that runs 10ft to my HDMI-enabled receiver, and from there to my 71" Samsung. Video is perfect. So you can believe that, unless you have a faulty PS3, it's not the PS3 (but do double-check those HDMI connectors... they don't lock, they can work their way out). <br>  <br>  It is possible, but not too easy, to build an HDMI cable that screws up 1080p. Technically, the orginal HDMI spec is fine, and if you're nervous, HDMI 1.3 supports even higher data rates (they are usually the only cables anyone sells any longer). I buy mine here: <a href="http://www.monoprice.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.monoprice.com.</a> <br>  <br>  Double-check your TV's specs... it should specifically mention support of 1080/60p over HDMI. Some might support 1080/24p, which some Blu-Ray players produce, but not the more general 1080/60p. Something to double-check. <br>  <br>  If you can't blame the TV or the PS3, blame the cable. I would beg/steal/borrow another one, a high quality HDMI 1.3 cable, and just see if that fixes your problem, before you go dropping money on cables. And watch out for big-box stores.. they compete on HDTV prices, but expect to make big profits on selling cables. That $150 cable you get at Best-Buy is not likely any better than the $25 cable I get at Monoprice.|`|CFPNtjuBaa	Setting up your HDMI cable on your PS3 games console<br>  <br>  1: Turn on your TV and set its input to HDMI.<br>  <br>  2: Make sure your PS3 is connected via a HDMI cable.<br>  <br>  3: Power on your PS3 and press and hold the power button for approx. 5 seconds, you will hear the PS3 start to beep, release the power button after the second beep.<br>  <br>  4: Your PS3 should automatically configure itself for HDMI video and Audio output.|`|1BczzYkOaa	Either your TV doesn't actually support a 1080p signal or your TV is not HDCP compliant which would cause 1080p signals to momentarily appear then become blank.<br>  <br>  If it's fuzzy then there may be something wrong with your HDMI cable. Only extremely long runs of 50ft or more should cause any fuzziness though. <br>  <br>  I would be more inclined to think your TV is having HDCP issues if it works fine at other resolutions. I would call Samsung.

Get your guitar and a guitar cord and hit your local pawn shops you will be amazed at what you can get for $200.00 or less and most pawn shops will guarantee the amp for 30,60 90 days or some even up to a year. You will never go wrong that way.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	I'll second the pawn shop suggestion. You'll find Gibsons, Fenders, Marshalls.

After that, you have to buy a recharger for your controller which costs about $30-40 for only 1 controller.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 also had this thing called "RROD" which will break your Xbox 360 and you have to send it to Microsoft for them to fix it. It takes about 3-4 weeks for them to fix it. The RROD happens in about 33% of all 360's and it happens from overheating, which means playing it too long. The PS3 only had 0.2% chance of breaking.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Everything the 360 does PS3 does better. Online is free on PS3 and it is better than Xbox Live. You pay 50$ a year for Xbox's online service. Honestly you can't go wrong with PS3. Xbox's have a 33% failure rate while PS3s have just 1%. PS3 has a larger and game collection with more of a variety of games. PS3 has a lot of great games coming out this year like Killzone 2, God of War III, InFAMOUS, MAG and Uncharted: Among Thieves. PS3 has better sports games (exclusives like NBA 09 The Inside and MLB: The Show) It has better racing games (Motorstorm, Ridge Racer, Grand Turismo)Trust me you will not be disappointing in the PS3.

Just buy them both and be done with it.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Playstation 3 because the online is free|`|fLF2VM8uaa	This question comes up a lot and it always yields a bunch of bad advice and misinformation. <br>  <br>  Here's the deal. Almost 90% of the games developed are developed for both systems. With VERY FEW exceptions, these games are equally good on both systems. People will argue about graphics and controllers and costs whatnot, but the true difference in any of these things is minimal (the 360 is easier to keep costs low early on, but you will end up spending about the same amount on either system). <br>  <br>  The difference lies in 3 things:<br>  <br>  1) Features<br>  <br>  Both have online gaming, ability to download games/movies, and peripherals out the wazzo, but the PS3 has a Blu Ray player (something many don't use), a web browser (something most don't use), the ability to use ANY Bluetooth input devices (which many people DO use), and uses a laptop hard drive which can easily be upgraded to whatever storage capacity you can find (250GB is not hard to find and not very expensive). <br>  <br>  2) Online gaming<br>  <br>  While both have online gaming, the 360 has an interface that is much more user friendly and intuitive. It is easy to find online games and it has many more gamers online. The PS3 has an online interface (Home) that is still in its "Beta" phase. It's supposed to be the cat's meow, but as of right now it is merely a chat room with mobile avitars. It has potential, but after 2 years of the system being out, it still has no uniform platform for online gaming. <br>  <br>  3) Exclusive Content<br>  <br>  Both systems have their winners when it comes to exclusive content. The 360 has Gears of War and Halo with exclusive Grand Theft Auto 4 (the game of the year in the opinion of many) content. The PS3 has Metal Gear Solid 4, Uncharted, Little Big Planet, and Killzone 2. The real difference comes when you look at the TYPES of exclusive content for each system. Both have great shooters. The PS3 has a more varied mix of exclusive content. While Home is not ready for primetime as an online interface, it is very unique and useful as chat rooms go, and I expect that computers will quickly seek to copycat the home environment as the next iteration in chat room technology. <br>  <br>  From and overall standpoint I would argue the PS3 is a better system. It has more features and more varied content and many of the "hard core gaming experts" argue that the upcoming PS3 content is superior to the upcoming 360 content. <br>  <br>  That said, I don't think that the system is better for everyone. If you don't have a high definition TV the Blu Ray player is useless, and if you like shooters I would argue that the 360 has better exclusive shooters than the PS3. Lastly, there are more 360 owners than PS3 owners. If your friends have 360s, you are going to feel left out when they go online and play, if you get a PS3. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|kposhq84aa	K ill show u tips of which one to get. You can't really say which one is better because it's all about opinion<br>  <br>  Playstation : Playstation has blue-ray and has blue-ray discs which gives it extreme graphics. You can watch movies, listen to music browse on the internet on playstation. When u play online in playstation u dont have to pay. Playstation is more durable and has no defects unless u buy one that is defective. The playstation is overall lets just say, more durable, but the games are on the flaw of playstation it self. Playstation doesn't have a lot of fun games and the games that are there are kind of boring except for resistance, which is kind of repetitive. <br>  <br>  Xbox 360 : Xbox 360 is extremely fun but has no blu-ray but still have stunning graphics. The games in xbox are the reason why so many people buy xbox360.  Xbox360 is more proned to RROD (red ring of death) but microsoft has practically worked around that by making the falchion chipset and the jasper chipset. You can watch movies and listen to music like the playstation. The xbox rattles and is alittle more fragile then the playstation. Another flaw would be that u have to pay $60 for 13months of live. The games in xbox360 even without the blu-ray extreme graphics, it still has enough stunning graphics to overtake the games in playstation.|`|wL9OyMK9aa	The PS3 has arguably better graphics, but there aren't as many good games out yet compared to the Xbox 360 (which still has very nice graphics). Also, the PS3 can play Blu-Ray disks, but the Xbox 360 can only play HD-DVD (which is effectively a dead format these days).<br>  <br>  I don't have much experience with either, but that's what I've heard from friends who do own the consoles.

QYlCApOFaa	In my opinion, you paid way too much for it, and it would cost a few hundred dollars to turn it into a decent one. See if you can sell it back to the guy, or find someone else who doesn't know anything about computers, and sell it to them.<br>  <br>  compare it to this for example, so you know what I mean:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4435970&CatId=333" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a><br>  <br>  Now there is no monitor, keyboard or mouse, but it's cheaper, its way more powerful, and it brand new. Good luck.
EMmGFqgJaa	The easiest thing to do is show your parents that you can handle having a cellphone. Show them that you are mature and that you won't loose it or drop it down the toilet. <br>  <br>  If you look at some of the questions on Yahoo answers you'll see a lot of teens who break or loose their cellphones or cause their cellphone bill to be a couple hundred dollars because they didn't track their talking time. I have had a cellphone for many years and I have never lost or damage my cellphone in anyway. <br>  <br>  Personally I think 13 is a bit young for a cellphone. 14 is I think a more typical age of someone who is mature enough to handle the responsibilities of having a cellphone. <br>  <br>  Telling your parents that everybody else has a cellphone won't get you a cellphone. You say you can pay for the phone but can you pay for the calling plan which at a minimum is $30 a month for the lowest minute plan without texting.

AbRfd29Haa	You don't have normal brightness controls on the PS3, any more than you would have them on a satellite box or VCR... it's the monitor's job to deal with this. If adjustments on your TV have no effect, double-check that you're doing it right. <br>  <br>  But there are some tweaks on the PS3. One issue is dynamic range.. some TVs can really show 24-bit color, others are stuck with the smaller gamut of NTSC or PAL. So look on the AV settings menu. If you're using analog component (YPrPb), there's a setting for a "Super White" display.. setting this wrong can mess you up. <br>  <br>  Next is "RGB Full Range".. as mentioned, some displays can handle full color output, others are limited. Tweak this, and see if it looks better.   <br>  <br>  Other than that, the only adjustments for any normal video output device are on the monitor/TV, not the device.

What this means is that your Xbox 360 is experiencing a hardware malfunction. There are several different ways that are rumored to fix this problem, however I will demonstrate the most widely used method, more commonly known as the "Towel Method"<br>  <br>  This method is only temporary, there have been reports of users using this method frequently to keep their Xbox running. I urge that you contact Microsoft customer support and have them mail you an empty box (coffin) to ship your precious console off to Texas where it will be repaired.<br>  <br>  Important!<br>  Before you watch the movie or view the instructible, note that I have already used the method depicted here on my Xbox successfully, so I can't exactly replicate it (now that it's fixed) for the movie. When I get the Rings again I will redo the movie to show you exactly how it works. <br>  <br>  For now enjoy my badly made and extremely corny movie.<br>  <br>  Also Important<br>  I don't suck at Guitar Hero, this was only a demonstration where I goofed up once because it was like 2 a.m. when I made the movie. For proof that I don't suck, I direct you to another of my videos. For additional proof of the same song but up close on the fingers, please go here.<br>  <br>  Note: for whatever reason, my sound cuts out at the beginning of the movie, but the first sentence is: "Like 30-33% of Xbox 360 owners, I have expiuerenced the red rings of death." Enjoy!|`|utAKfPYZaa	The red rings show up when you get like a virus thing on it and you have to send your xbox in and they will fix it for you. I dont think there is any other way to fix it other than sending it in and getting it fixed.

VlzaXlNkaa	GameStop, as any business that is trying to make money will do, will give you standard trade in value for the unopened games you give them if you do not have the receipts for them.  If you can prove you purchased them and have the receipt with clearly defined and non-mutilated printing, only then will you get sticker price as stated on the receipt.  If it is older than 30 days, it's pretty much up to the manager on duty, but I've given current price on them before when an older valid receipt was provided.<br>  <br>  You are probably better off selling them on eBay or just sucking it up and taking trade-in value.  It's better than nothing.|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	Like nothing. It's Xbox 1, nobody plays that or wants them anymore. It won't matter that they're sealed.

9mTctb7jaa	no difference at all. It is VGA when your display resolution is set to 480x640 pixel, and SVGA when set to 600x800 pixel. <br>  <br>  perhaps you are thinking of S-video which is nothing like VGA. VGA is analog 3 component (red/blue/green) channels, with sync on green.  S-video is 2 component analog, luma (b/w) and chroma modulated at 3.58 MHz carrier.

AoxkInedaa	did they say if they traced the call directly from the house cause it could be someone pranking and calling the cops faking an emergency and telling them that they live at your address|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Call the phone company. Tell them what is happening. Someone else has the address wrong for their number.|`|4G41Z3RJaa	I agree with Edg1.  A call to 911 gives the information that the telephone company has on record for the telephone number.  You cannot call 911 and hide the calling number.  If someone called from a number that was hidden and passed out, how would the police know or ambulance know where to go.  The only problem is with phones over the Internet, land lines are not a problem as the Telco knows the location of the phone which is hard wired to their office.  An IP phone over the Internet can be made from any where, so someone could have used your address, and get electronic bills and pay for them.<br>  You should always get the badge number and name of the officer that arrives at the house and then call the police station later to discuss the problem, and try for a resolution.  Six times seem to me to be too many times, if the calls were apparently originating from your house, once the police might consider a mistake, twice and they are not going to be happy, three or more times and they should be talking about discussing it with you at the police station.  It is a serious crime to make unnecessary calls to 911, in most areas.  Some areas they would be talking fines or jail time for the first call, and discussing it with you at the station the second time.|`|CcR9kvHhaa	I think they're just annoying you...

This resets your iPod.|`|tgROmqffaa	if you didn't get ALL of your music from the itunes store there is a possibility that one or more of your songs may have viruses in them.  If you upload them to your ipod and then play the song your ipod may have contracted the virus.  With the virus your ipod is pretty much useless unless you can find some way to get it off of there.

gyxlJO8Gaa	la ps3 è molto meglio. Fidati.|`|GRtryrp4aa	xbox 360|`|QkECtOUNaa	x360, la sola cosa che rende la ps3 + interessante della x360 è il blueray, ma dipende dai giochi perchè ad esempio cod4 o gta4 hanno la stessa grafica, e poi al posto di God of War abbiamo Gears of war, e al posto di MGS4...gears batte tutti e due!!!!!! |`|E3dmHxhBaa	X box 360 è megilo di ps3 ed ecco perchè:<br>  Partiamo dal problema di surriscaldamento(e non di bruciatura,che è un altra cosa).<br>  Questo problema è stato risolto con i nuovi modelli di x box 360 Falcon,tuttora in commercio.<br>  Questo processore Falcon fa si che la console non si surriscaldi più.Tutte le xbox 360 in commercio sono Falcon. <br>  1-programmazione-Programmare su piattaforma Xbox 360:<br>  Il sistema operativo non utilizza il core ‘0’, ma usa circa il 3% della potenza del core ‘1’ e il 3% del core ‘2’, quindi il 98% della potenza dei tre core rimane libera e utilizzabile dalle applicazioni videoludiche. Programmare per 360 è abbastanza semplice e diretto grazie alla quantità di memoria principale condivisa, alla dimensione della cache L2 e al fatto che le informazioni passano molto facilmente e velocemente attraverso i differenti threads dell’applicazione con l’uso dei puntatori.<br>  Tipicamente un’applicazione viene inizialmente sviluppata utilizzando un solo thread di un core, poi, una volta sviluppata l’appz, il tutto viene segmentato per utilizzare più core e possibilmente anche più threads hardware per ogni core. Il modo più semplice per operare questa segmentazione è quello di assegnare il codice di controllo del gioco e l’AI ad un core e il codce di rendering grafico ad un altro core. Non appena il codice dell’AI è stato eseguito vengono inviate al core di rendering grafico e informazioni per processare il frame successivo. Quindi il codice di rendering grafico eseguito sul secondo core va a creare il frame corrente mentre simultaneamente l’AI esegue il codice necessario al frame successivo.<br>  Segmentare il codice ulteriormente comincia ad essere molto più difficile. Lo sviluppatore deve anzitutto determinare dove potrebbero formarsi dei colli di bottiglia. Se questi si verificano all’interno del codice AI, dovrà accertarsi che possa essere attuata una processazione parallela (per esempio in un gioco racing, potrebbe essere possibile che il programma principale processi l’AI di 5 auto e un altro core processi l’AI di altre 5 auto sula tracciato contemporaneamnte). Se il collo di bottiglia si verifica invece nel codice della grafica, allora è possibile assegnare parte del codice di rendering in parallelo ad un altro core.<br>  Quando un programma è suddiviso su tre core, uno dei core è attivo per il 100% del tempo mentre gli altri due possono risultare attivi per poco tempo (10%, 20%, 50%, etc.). In tal caso è richiesta maggior segmentazione sul core occupato al 100%, quindi può essere aggiunto un nuovo thread hardware a uno dei core meno attivi per gestire 2 processi allo stesso tempo. Una volta saturati tutti i threads hardware disponibili, se è necessaria una ulteriore segmentazione, possono essere istanziati dei threads software (che sono comunque meno efficienti di quelli hardware) fino a che anche quel core non raggiunge il 100% dell’occupazione.<br>  Una volta che tutti e 3 i core hanno un’utilizo prossimo al 100% saranno stati raggiunti il massimo frame rate, la massima sofisticatezza e dettaglio grafico. Se l’AI propone frames più velocemente di quanto la GPU non possa processarne (massimo 60 fps a 720p o 30 fps a 1080i), possono essere aggiunti ulteriori dettagli.<br>  <br>  Programmare su piattaforma PS3:<br>  Programmare per PS3 è molto più difficile di quanto non lo sia su Xbox 360. In un certo senso PS3 è stata progettata in modo simile ai sistemi multi processore utilizzati in ambiti specifici, per esempio al NASA Ames Research Center. Il concetto si basa sul principio che vede un enorme quantità di dati matematici che si ripetono e che possono essere processati in parallelo o sequenzialmente ma spezzettati (per esempio un core moltiplica due array di 10000 numeri e poi passa l’array risultante a un altro core che opera divisioni sui singoli elementi dell’array e ne passa il risultato a un altro core che provvederà ad atre operazioni sui dati e così via; dopo che il primo core ha terminato l’operazione, acquisisce nuovi dati e prosegue su questi con la stessa operazione.<br>  Così come avviene per Xbox 360, anche qui l’applicazione viene inizialmente sviluppata utilizzando il core PPE. A questo punto sarebbe lecito pensare che la PS3 (come la 360) sia in grado di segmentare il codice assegnando a un core il codice di controllo dell’AI e ad un altro il codice di rendering grafico. Questo non è possibile! Dal momento che il codice vero e proprio di un’applicazione si attesta sui 100 MB e che la memoria di ciascun SPE è di soli 256KB solo 1/400 del codice totale può essere depositato nella memoria di uno SPE. Inoltre poiché in uno SPE non c’è capacità di branch prediction (<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predizi...l..." rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predizi...l...</a> , le diramazioni andrebbero fatte il più piccole possibili.<br>  <br>  Questo è già un enorme vantaggio per x box 360!|`|n04NIBE3aa	la 360 ha una scheda video + potente della ps3<br>  cmq se vuoi tenerti aggiornato su console e altro vai qui<br>  <a href="http://teenworldnews.forumfree.net/?t=31762184" rel="nofollow">http://teenworldnews.forumfree.net/?t=31...</a>|`|K1eudHgwaa	Se vuoi giocare e divertirti xbox 360 se vuoi uno scaldabagno ps3<br>  |`|GlUhYt3Xaa	allora come rapporto qualità prezzo sicuramente la xbox360 fa la differenza!e poi hanno la stessa grafica l'unica cosa che li distingue e l'online:nella xbox dovrai pagare 60 euro l'anno mentre nella ps3 e gratis ed ho sentito dire che l'online su xbox e molto meglio!ma xò attenzione se compri xbox360 dovrai rinunciare a 2 giochi bellissimi GOD OF WAR 3 e MGS4!quindi se vai matto x questi senza ombra di dubbio prendi al volo la ps3!|`|Uua4YJ3raa	xbox 360...miglior grafica,migliorr giochi e anche piu gioki costo piu basso rispetto alla ps3 fidati prenditi un xbox pro con hard disk integrato e vedrai kuanto è bella se poi vuoi spenere un po di piu prenditi una elite stupenda 120 gb di memoria.......|`|AAIGvgWkaa	perchè non te le compri tutte e due oppure perchè non cerchi un po' tra le 1000000000 domande già esistenti sull'argomento dove tantissimi bambini dicono la loro opinione e cosi non apri la 1000000001° domanda sull'argomento? grazie...|`|aDcxuADWaa	sicuramente ps3 è meglio per caratteristiche per giochi e per la grafica|`|gZz9Gkw0aa	Xbox360 fidati.|`|5yACQB5Iaa	ps3|`|M3GwrJtoaa	ps3333333333

1VkZjdhYaa	Actually the rest of the people that answered are wrong. I know because I have the same messaging plan that you have and I know the terms. Every text message you go over is 10 cents unless it is international (25 cents). You are looking at 9 dollars for the 90 text messages you went over.<br>  <br>  If you know you are going to go over again, I would not get unlimited because that is about $30 or $35 a month if I'm not mistaken. I would just get the next one which lets you send and recieve 1500 messages to others outside Verizon and it only costs you 5 dollars more per month.<br>  <br>  Finally, you might want to try and call verizon directly once you get your bill (if there is an overage charge because sometimes you might think that you went over but some of those texts are actually to verizon customers) and tell them that if they can take care of the fee as a one time courtesy. They might do it if you pay on time and it is your first time and you tell them that you didn't know how to check the usage.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck!|`|ewIELhBiaa	I also have verizon and I believe the cost is .15 per text so if you went over by 90 you should be billed an additional 13.50<br>  <br>  this is my plan so it may very for everyone.

Texts cost 20 cents, 25 for pix & flix. Thats the same for if you go over. The price doesn't drop b/c you have a plan.  You can get an ulimited plan for 59.99 a month. If you don't want unlimited, you can get 1500 texts for $15 a month, but If you spend $5 more, you get unlimited! You're already paying $10 for 500 messages, why not pay $10 more to have  unlimited?

However, you can buy entry level dSLR cameras for less than a grand (if you want full control and better image quality and performance).<br>  <br>  I doubt if you really want a dSLR...so any good point & shoot will do. My pick of the point & shoots are Canon's SD models. They're ultra compact, look cool, have cool features and have good image quality.

You cant read this Article.Canon PowerShot A590 IS Point-and-Shoot Camera<br>  For a beginner's camera, the PowerShot A590IS offers amazing image quality and superb stabilization.<br>  Alexa Wriggins<br>  Tuesday, August 19, 2008 02:30 PM PDT<br>  <br>  <br>  My digital camera expertise begins and ends with this fact: I cannot resist the urge to photograph a couple of fuzzballs named Chuckie and Violet. I'm a classic novice point-and-shooter, and the crème de la crème of my snapshots find their way onto Flickr or Facebook.<br>  <br>  <br>  Recently, I spent some time with the 8-megapixel Canon PowerShot A590IS digital camera to see how fully it would meet my list of very basic snapshooting requirements and how well it would compensate fro my lack of technical proficiency. For a bargain-bin price of $150, it has a lot of features: 8-megapixel resolution, 4X optical zoom, optical image stabilization, face detection (which recognizes faces in the frame and optimizes the autofocus accordingly) and a smaller-but-serviceable 2.5-inch LCD screen. And conveniently it runs on two AA batteries.<br>  <br>  <br>  To orient myself to the camera and gain insight into its features and functions, I ripped the A590IS out of the box and started taking pictures. I had no trouble working my way through various settings, quickly finding and using many of the 19 shooting modes, including portrait, landscape, and auto. Not surprisingly, the A590IS doesn't support a full range of manual settings (what do you expect for $150?), but it does let you program the shutter speed and aperture settings manually if you want to.<br>  <br>  <br>  The big news with this point-and-shoot camera is image quality. Despite its rock-bottom price, the A590IS scored significantly higher in our image-quality assessments than point-and-shoots that cost more than twice as much and have higher megapixel counts. In particular, our judges noted superior colors and flash exposures in our subjective tests.<br>  <br>  <br>  Image quality gets an assist from my favorite A590IS feature: the optical image stabilizer. I tried desperately to take a blurry picture--and I failed. No matter how hard I shook that camera or how much my subjects shimmied, I couldn't induce a blurry image. (Unfortunately for me, the A590IS does permit photo subject guillotinage if the picture taker frames the shot badly enough.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Like many other Canon cameras, the PowerShot A590IS has a classic, easy-to-hold ergonomic shape with a fat thumb/hand grip on the right side. Though it's comfortable to hold, the camera body lacks rubber or textured trim on the plastic surface of its hand grip, which makes the grip a bit slick. I also wished that the camera were smaller: It's a compact camera, but not exactly pocketable. You'll need to secure it in a small camera bag before stowing it in your purse or backpack, or you'll risk scratching it up. <br>  <br>  <br>  Though the AA batteries are great for convenience, the A590IS produced only 248 shots running on a fresh pair. Many point-and-shoots can take more than 300 shots on a single charge.<br>  <br>  <br>  Photos from the PowerShot A590IS will never be mistaken for digital SLR output, but this camera is a great choice for anyone seeking an inexpensive, easy-to-use point-and-shoot that produces high-quality images. And don't be afraid to put its optical image stabilization to the test. <br>  <br>  |`|5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	Buy the biggest SLR you can afford if you are real serious.  I bought a smaller digital one first and it took videos and some pretty good pictures but then I was too far away for animals.  Then I found out my old 35mm EF lenses would fit the new digital Canon SLR.  My sister has a SLR Nikon and swears by it.  I really like my Canon.  I have a Rebel because it's all I can afford and it does an excellent job.  There are bigger and better but unless you are going into professional photography and have lots of $ the Rebel does a good job.  There are tons of smaller ones that are good too.  You need to get Consumer Reports and check several camera mags where they compare the latest cameras.  Buy a camera that fits your needs.  My first one was excellent but just needed the telephoto. . .and now I want bigger telephoto. . .Everyone can give you all kinds of advice but new cameras come out every day and yesterdays camera in the smaller ones is replaced almost twice a year.  Get current info.  With SLR you can change your lens and buy bigger and better as you go and can afford.  You can use filters to help with color enhancement.  I f you get a small one, you have to get another camera to move up.  If you get a smaller one be sure it takes videos.  I have some great fireworks and football games.<br>  A digital SLR is a lot more than $450 unless you shop very very carefully.  They are much cheaper on the internet.  I bought mine off of an ebay shop but was worried I would get screwed.  There are other places on line and beware the places from New York.

RMmh0aimaa	Alkaline batteries and alkaline cells (a battery being a collection of multiple cells) are a type of disposable battery or rechargeable battery dependent upon the reaction between zinc and manganese (IV) oxide (Zn/MnO2).<br>  <br>  Compared with zinc-carbon batteries of the Leclanché or zinc chloride types, while all produce approximately 1.5 volts per cell, alkaline batteries have a higher energy density and longer shelf-life. Compared with silver-oxide batteries, which alkalines commonly compete against in button cells, they have lower energy density and shorter lifetimes but lower cost.<br>  <br>  The alkaline battery gets its name because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide, as opposed to the acidic electrolyte of the zinc-carbon batteries which are offered in the same nominal voltages and physical size.

AA11056614	You say how high, but not where in the room.  Personally, I like to put my projectors at the back of the room so I can mount on a shelf on the wall. If you want to do the same (and can't use wall mounted shelving) you can use a portable bookshelf unit (you may even find one with adjustable shelves), or you can make one, or use a step ladder. <br>  <br>  Given the size of the projector you may need to screw a piece of plywood to the shelf to hold the projector. If you need to invert the projector you can use bolts through the shelf that screw into the mounting holes intended for a ceiling mount.<br>  <br>  If the projector has vertical lens shift you can aim the image using that so it hits the screen correctly. If not you will have to be precise with the screen location or with spacers under the projector. I's plan on spacers personally since inevitably you will need to make fine adjustments. Use wedges and make sure the projector is kept horizontal to avoid keystone.

F5fIBGCraa	Probably the easiest place to buy a roof antenna is Radio Shack, although other places that sell consumer electronic equipment (especially TVs) will usually have them.  It's been a lot of years since I've personally dealt with such antennas, so I don't know about current costs.  You have to figure, though, that a rooftop installation will cost about the same as 6-12 months of cable or satellite service, and the only advantage is that it lasts for years if you're going to be living in the same place.<br>  <br>  Contrary to some of the hype (or pure bull crap), there is no difference between "analog" or "digital" antennas.  An antenna is designed to pick up a signal within the range of frequencies it was designed for, regardless of signal type.<br>  <br>  For a TV antenna, there are two types, VHF and UHF.  Most antennas these days are a combination for both.  Currently, all digital broadcasting is switching to the UHF frequencies, but some will return to the VHF band within a few years after the switch.  The difference in cost is relatively insignificant, so don't limit yourself.<br>  <br>  The main difference in antenna expense is the number of elements.  The more elements, the stronger the pickup capability of the antenna.  If the stations in your area stay within 10-20 miles, a fewer number of elements is satisfactory, but if the transmitter sites are located further away, you may need an antenna with more elements to pickup 35-40 miles away.<br>  <br>  Forget antenna amplifers.  It's the number of elements that provide the primary gain of an antenna.  If there isn't enough, then all an electronic amplifier will do is amplify the noisy poor reception.  Since antennas, themselves, are not powered devices, the only gain factor is generated by their directionality.  There is the first, and most agravating, major cost after the antenna, itself:  the rotor.  It's an electronic device consisting of a remote next to your TV, and a motor on your antenna mount, to physically rotate your antenna for the best pickup.<br>  <br>  The other consideration for station transmitters that are further away is height of the antenna.  The earth's curvature, while mild, is still sufficient to subdue the TV signal over relatively short distances.  The higher the antenna, the better to overcome the curvature.  On 2-story houses, it works out fairly well since the antenna potentially can be 2? stories high.  But a single-story home would require almost a miniature tower to get the antenna up high enough.<br>  <br>  For hooking up your antenna to your digital converter, you only need a cheapie balun transformer ($1.50) to convert your 300-ohm antenna to a 75-ohm coaxial cable.  But the installation hardware adds up to about twice the cost of the antenna itself.  And a professional installer, of course, raises the price even higher.  But he will know about such things as proper grounding of the antenna so that lightning strikes go to ground rather than your TV.<br>  <br>  Things to keep in mind:  If you belong to an HOA, in some subdivisions, they may prohibit outside antenna systems.  Shame to spend all that money only to find out you have to take it all back down and get cable after all.  The other consideration is that cable/satellite providers are required by law to continue providing analog conversion without extra fees through the year 2012 at least, and you'd get more channels for your money.

However, when the camera thinks you do not need a flash then you need to override it. <br>  In the menu on the camera go to the flash settings and find the release for the flash to be used when you wish it. That should do the trick.<br>  Of course, all the above advices to learn the user manual are correct.<br>  It is always best to know the full capability of your machine.

SKkE3fK1aa	If you really are looking for these features then I suggest not getting a smartphone. A smartphone is for productivity and connectivity not for typical cellphone uses. Call, text, music, pictures, video and regular internet is typical cellphone uses (also email). This is because all modern phones released today is for that purpose.<br>  <br>  However, if you are really looking for a smartphone (or PDA), then I suggest looking at the Nokia N82, E63 and N79. I recommend these phones as these smartphones (Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition; Symbian OS 9.2/9.3) are user-friendly and you can get tons of apps for it, compared to Windows Mobile.<br>  <br>  These phones I have mentioned comes with your typical QuickOffice (viewing Word, PowerPoint and Excel 2003 documents), Adobe Reader (for PDF viewing) and Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 (for viewing SWF files and for viewing Flash Content on the HTML Browser). <br>  <br>  Remember, smartphones are useless without applications. So maybe you ought to consider upgrading your QuickOffice to 6.0 (edit and view 2007 documents) and getting a dictionary software with audio support (MSDict 5.00) and maybe a Weather Forecaster (ForecaWeather) and even some top-notch games for it (N-Gage 2.0).
