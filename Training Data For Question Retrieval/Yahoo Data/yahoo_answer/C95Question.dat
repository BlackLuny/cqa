The Army released no further details on the incident, but at the trial of others involved in the case witnesses testified that at least six members of the Gangster Disciples gang beat Johnson during a gang initiation ritual.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090226/ap_o...       The report, released in February 2007, noted that members of nearly every major street gang -- including MS-13, Bloods, Crips, 18th Street, Hells Angels and various white supremacist groups -- have been identified on both domestic and international military bases.   There are no official statistics on gang membership in the military, but some experts have estimated that 1 to 2 percent of the U.S. military are gang members, FBI gang investigator Jennifer Simon said in a published article. It is believed that only .02 percent of the U.S. population are gang members.       http://www.military.com/news/article/gan...

20090226131443AAA6sVG	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Help for a victim of domestic abuse?	To cut a long story short turkish husband is here in the UK on a spouse visa, he arrived in July last year and has made mine and my children's life unbearable.  He is rude, arrogant and violent.  Last november he threatened to kill me and held a knife to my throat demanding i tell him i love him.      I reported this to the police who arrested him and charged him with 'threat to kill' and 'common assault'.  He was bailed out of the county and not allowed to contact me.       He was caught at the house once and taken back to Essex.  I allowed him into the house once more to 'talk' over the situation, i guess i hoped that after 14months of fighting to get him here it was worth a little more fight.      He has bullied me into staying here but to be honest sometimes i think it is better for him to be here than run and hide, this is something he is good at, he evaded deportation for 8 years.  The thought of him not attending court to be honest makes me mad, surely he should be punished for what he did.       I have gone through so many emotions, guilt, panic and trying to sort my head out as to if i love him still or not.        He is due in crown court monday and i can see that it will go two ways - either he will be let off and that gives him the green light to do it again or he will be sentanced to prison which leaves the rest of his family and the turkish community where i live hating me and my children that could lead to violence..      All i really wanted to know was if anyone else had experienced the same.  I know he should not be in this house but he will DEFINATELY run, he has told me he will go into hiding and change his identity to evade deportation.      Thank you

20090226143745AAj4kSF	Politics & Government;Politics	Parents are Liberal Democrats.. I'm a Social Conservative. What is the best way to handle the situation?	Both of my parents are pro-liberal Democrats, while I'm very much a social conservative. (Not a Republican, because I don't agree with everything they belief in, but definitely a social conservative)       I love both of my parents very much and mostly, I have a wonderful relationship with them. But when it comes to politics (especially now, with Barack Obama and a Democratic Majority in Congress) - we never can get along. The problem is that I'm not very good at debating the issues with my parents and when I react the wrong way (and by that, I mean yelling, while they are smiling and being "calm") to their false accusations about my personal beliefs - they view that as my inability to prove my arguement.       To add insult to injury, when I try to avoid the discussion of politics, they will bring up the discussion even when they know I wish to avoid the topic altogether. Its as if they take delight in spreading their beliefs just to see me react. I'm just about done with their attitude.      So here's my question - What is the best way to handle a situation like this, has anyone else been in my particular situation?      Thank you.
20090226151845AAV8qXT	Politics & Government;Politics	Can Congress Vote to give DC a seat in the House?	Per the US Constitution, no, because DC is not a state. Changes to the Constitution require an Amendment. Hence, the 19th Amendment (Women's Vote), 26 Amendment (18 Yr Old's could vote) cannot just be voted on by Congress. 3/4 of States must approve.      So my question is why all arguments about the process? Nobody denies giving DC a voting seat in the house, just the process it should be done in to be in line with the Constitution. Absent making DC a state (which they could do) or making DC apart of Maryland or VA (which they could also do), the route they are currently going requires an amendment. So why not just right one up which would easily get universal support in both Houses and approval by 37 or more states. Why go the route that brings into questions the constitutionality at all?      Congress cannot just vote DC voting rights (unconstitutional). This case would reach the Supreme Court and would be defeated 5-4 (Kennedy joins the right side of the bench on this one). All it seems to do is waste a lot of time over something that could easily be done with little problems.

We would like to talk to him about this tonight, but I'd like to have my ducks in a row before we do.      Does anyone know what we could expect to happen if he is caught out after curfew?

Conservative have been calling everything that they don't a liberal agenda.

Why are conservatives so struck on liberal agenda when they have one of their own. For example, point out and blow out of proportion any bad things about Obama and democrats and downplay any good things Democrats and Obama do. Why are they trying to hide their own agenda, MSNBC doesn't  that claim to be fair and balanced, and they don't try to hide being liberal. Yet Fox is fixed on claiming they're "fair and balanced"

I really think that a law such as `caught trying to kill somebody means life imprisonment NO APPEAL ALLOWED`   and.. `intenionaly killing somebody when unprovoked`, is lethal injection within a year of sentencing....      I think strict laws like that would DEFINATLY reduce gun/knife related crimes and murders      what do you think      ps im NOT  a psycho and nor do i endorse killings, but i think that if you kill somebody... you deserve nothing less than to not live out your life

20090226122459AACpSyu	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How do I get my son to move out - police can't remove him?	My 27 yr old son has come back home again.  He has been using drugs off and on for 7 years but once again, cleaned up his act a few months ago.  He got a great job that he really loves (finally). He was living with his friend and his wife but unknown to us at the time we  took him back, he was asked to leave there because he was starting old habits again.  He told us that the landlord didn't want another person living there. He manages to work and is only using after work so far.  I told him he is back on the road to hell.  He works in another state and is using my car for the hour commute.  He came back here stating that he would only be here for two weeks until he found an apartment.  Now, as expected, he's changing his tune saying he doesn't have the money.  I am really hurting and don't want him here but I don't want him to lose the only job he has cared enough about to show up for every single day for 4 months!  You don't know how amazing that is after over a year of doing nothing!!   I have tried to throw him out over the years and the police say they can't remove him as he lives here, (gets mail here) and has a right to be here.  In other words, he could call the police on me and say that I was using drugs just as I could on him.  So now you say that I have to call them when he is high...done that and as soon as they show up he seems perfectly normal and rational.  He does not get as wasted as he has in the past and usually only once a week or so. In the past, the times that he was truly out-ot-it, I had him sectioned and put in a facility.  Temporary solution at best. I'm so frustrated and at the end of my rope again.  It is not easy to get him out when he is a functioning addict.  I have sent him out of state to half way houses.  I have gone through an enormous amount of money! I could go on and on with this tragic problem..... I have been on this road too long and wish there was an answer for me!

My husband received 14 years for receiving pictures of two 17 yr old girls.  (Federal Case) I think they think we will eventually get divorced. So they need to have something on me if it happens. What should I do? What are my rights? My house is paid for. I dont think i should have to move. I am doing nothing wrong.  I have told them before and have locked my doors but nothing helps.

Liberals are all about equal rights for women and minorities.They say that they don't use racially insensitive language or gender insensitive language,but the ones that hate Hillary Clinton act like some of the right wingers do when they talk about her. The stuff they say about her is just awful. Calling her a c-nt. Writing sexually demeaning things about her.On the internet,there are demeaning graphics about her. There was one thing I saw which said that Hillary belongs in the kitchen and not the White House.They talk about her voice and how it's screechy and robotic and she sounds like a nagging wife telling her husband to take out the trash. If there is one thing that unites Liberals and Conservatives,it would be their strong loathing they have towards her.       Now,there are some racially insensitive comments about Bobby Jindal right here      So how can they say that Republicans are insensitive when they do the same thing. I guess it just shows that it's more partisan bickering and saying anything to insult the "other side"      I'm not saying ALL Liberals are like this.This applies to some of the Liberals that said that all that stuff.I'm calling out the hypocrisy of those Liberals

These are the same people who constantly preach toward abstinence-only programs. What does this say about those types of programs?

20090226132653AA2wNpF	Politics & Government;Elections	Since the middle class is the biggest job creator, it should receive more money?	The middle classe's demand for more goods and services creates opportunity for small and large business owners to produce more products and services to make money. As a result, such small and large business owners hire more poeple ( = 'create jobs') to meet this large middle class demand in order to make profit.       Small business owners don't just hire more people because they receive tax cuts. Without an increased demand for products and services by the large middle class, tax cut for businesses is a waste. We are learning this common sense in a hard way after the Bush's massive dole to the wealthy, whilst decreasing the purchasing power of the middle class.

But we went there, removed Saddam, put their country in political/religious turmoil, established a democratic government to our liking and because we invaded them (I feel) we are responsible for their future.        I just had several friends come back from Iraq and they say things are a lot better and progress is being made.  However, they also say that if we withdraw too early, it wont be long before before the government collapses.        I agree we should eventually leave but doesn't it make sense to stay there until the country is stable and self sufficient?  It's not like the Iraqi's asked us to come help them so we came to their rescue.  We (America, yes even democrats) invaded Iraq and if we leave too early we will be at fault.

20090226134109AArcZDi	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I take my slumlord to court? (oregon)?	I rented a apartment for 675$ a month and paid nearly a grand in security deposits and fees. I couldn't find my lease and went down to my landlords office to ask when my lease was up she told me lease in hand the 3rd of february. I handed her my 30 days notice and she filed it away. I found a new apartment and began to move out well almost 27 days later she informs me that my lease isn't up for another month. She tells me she has a waiting list and if i hand over my keys they can get it spruced up for the new tenant. Please note she had 27 days to call me, leave a note to send me a e-mail and inform me of the mistake so I wouldn't be renting in two places but didn't even try!!  I gave her my key's on the 5th of february so i didn't have access to the apartment. She did not in my mind try to even  rent the apartment in a timely fashion as they advertised it almost 80$ more than i had been paying. Also, their "sprucing up" involved a contractor, ripping on the carpets, and a crew who has been working since the 6th of february. Needless to say, they charged me for the last months rent..is this legal and were do i find help? im an out of state college student.

I'm considering joining the Navy Reserves as Full Time Support (FTS), which is essentially similar to active duty (same pay and benefits). If you have any experience with this program, please share your opinion with me.       Also, the rating I'm wishing to get is AC (air traffic control), which is described as a "shore-intensive community". What exactly does that mean? What are my chances of being assigned to a ship as my first duty station?      If I get AC, should I just go active duty or should I still apply for FTS?      I'm a 24 female with an 18 month old child. I'm married to a Navy Reservist who is on "volunteer status" at the moment, but we have been separated for a year. Our child lives with me and would continue to live with me after completion of "A" school (my main reason for wanting to go FTS and get a shore-based rating)... I know, I know... I'm a poor candidate for serving, but trust me, there aren't many options in this economy and it's something that, if it works well, would be very good for us.      So, please share anything you can tell me about FTS and the AC rating. I appreciate your responses ahead of time, thank you. :)

If the Foreign office were to issue a warning that all British citizens should evacuate the Kandahar area immediately and the government at the same time passes a law stripping any British National of his nationality on the grounds of treason if he is found fighting against our armed forces, wouldn't it remove the possibility of using the argument of having strayed into the area by accident to investigate a muslim state or attending a wedding. Oh and they should also pass a law withdrawing the right to any legal aid for any traitor found fighting against our National forces. Everyone has a right to follow their ideology but it should always be treason to fight against our armed forces and they should expect no quarter, sympathy, legal aid and be barred from ever returning to the United Kingdom if they are caught.

20090226134232AAlPBJl	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is this considered harrassment?	Every day for the past week, I've ben getting random phone calls in the middle of class, my phone is on vibrate so the teacher doesnt notice of course, and i cant really answer it, so i just ignore it. It was always one call a day, and it would randomly happen but always in the middle of one of my classes. Then yesterday, in my 3rd period class, (btw the person we sort of suspected to be the caller is in my 3rd period class..) my cell rings, i thought it was him so im thinking "omg if its not him.. who is it???" then today at lunch, i was alone walking to my friends locker to meet her so we could go meet our other friends for lunch, and i saw the guy i thought was the caller, then he gives me a really evil smirk, and pulls out his cell a bit. I didnt say anything i just looked at him with a confused look (pretending i didnt know wat he was doing) then i told my friends about it, they all were like "huh? im confused.. if hes not the caller.. then who is first of all.. and second wat was tht randomness about?" (yes they called it randomness. He's in my class so how could he have called is what we all wondered. Then I decided to sort of watch him a bit in my 3rd period class today.. and I saw him reach into his pocket and pull out a cell phone, he hid it from the teacher of course, and then he shoved it back into his pocket (its not a flip phone btw so he could have dialed a number and shoved it into his pocket and let it ring.) My phone starts vibrating right after. I'm thinking "OMG is it him.. or is tht just a really big coincident??" But i say nothing and just let it vibrate and ignore it. Then he pulls his hand out of his pocket after it stops ringing. He didn't look at me the whole time this happened, but he did offer to hand some papers out (which he never ever offers..) and he walked by me while my phone was vibrating. But i put myself into a position that made it hard to see I had my cell in my pocket at all, and I acted like it wasnt ringing. Later, we begin to work in groups, and he asks if his group can work in the hallway, they do, and then when im working, my phone vibrates, i ignore it, and continue to work, they call back immediatly. I ignored it again, they did not call back again in class. Then today im walking home, my phone vibrates, i ignore it, about 3 minutes later it vibrates again, call number 5. i ignore it, i then call all my friends, and none of them called me the last 2 times. ( i know none of them wood call during class. especially since they r THERE wen it happens sometimes..) One of my friends did call me the last time, but the other 4 calls, nobody knows. I dont have caller ID and i *69 doesnt work, and client care wont tell me who it is. Is the mystery caller (even though im very very certain its tht guy..) harrassing me? Is it considered harrassment? Because I am now terrifired to answer my phone, so now if someone is going to call me, they have to text me first to say they r going to call or i wont answer out of fear its the mysery caller!!!!

My college is offering an opportunity in the Summer for students to study in Mexico or Hong Kong, and I really want to go to Mexico because i've heard from others that have been in previous years, and they said they had a great experience...but i'm unsure if I should go or not. I have nothing against Mexico, and have heard that it is a beautiful place; however, I have also been reading the news and it seems like there is a lot going on over there at the moment with our government, their government, drug cartels, etc. and I am just wondering if it would be safe for students to go?  I just really jumped at the opportunity to get credits, and a vacation at the same time.  Lol But now, i'm just wondering if I should go.  Is it safe to travel in Mexico at the moment?

20090226135540AAXWAb3	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Chances of becoming FBI agent with major in CJ and minor in accounting?	Hey guys, I have a few questions about becoming a federal agent. I am mostly interested in the FBI but DEA is also an option for me. I am a soph. in aerospace engineering and extremely bored with it. I'm trying to make a plan that will give me good odds of becoming an FBI special agent in the future.       I plan on switching my major to Criminal justice with a minor in accounting. Financial crimes are getting more and more common, so I feel accounting would be useful.       After graduating with a CJ major, I plan on becoming a local police officer and becoming a detective as soon as I am able too. After 2 years in the detective position I will be able to use Investigative work as my critical skill for the FBI.      I also considered joining up with the reserves for extra experience, but I was told this wasn't really necessary and wouldn't help for the FBI position. However, I am not sure if a CJ major and a minor in accounting + law enforcement is enough.      I have also been told that I should not get a CJ degree because they are close to worthless. I am wondering if this is true? And maybe I should even major in something else and join the reserves. So would a major in CJ + minor and accounting + reserves be a good way to get into the FBI?

20090226135903AAnTwpm	Politics & Government;Military	Enlist or OCS with master's degree?	Here is the deal:  I am a non-prior service 34 year old male with a BA and MA in the social sciences.  I have always wanted to serve my country. At this stage of my life the National Guard looks to be the best option. My dilemma:      (1) Enlist in Air Guard (receive E-3 rank immediately, student loan repayment (20k), and enlistment bonus(20k)).       (2) Enlist with Army Guard as 09S- OCS option (no bonus or student loan repayment, basic training, plus OCS and plus advanced officer training schools)      With the Army , I would receive a commission.  However, I could end up leading infantry units (no guaranteed job assignment).  With the AF, I could pick my job since I would be enlisted.  I realize the branches are vastly different.  I hear nothing but good things about the USAF, but I am not sure it is worth giving up being an officer.      Your thoughts?

20090226141518AA4KTuf	Politics & Government;Immigration	Why do some Latinos hate Anglos but not white Spaniards/Portuguese?	My guess: Latinos of mixed blood cannot bring themselves to hate the Spanish and Portuguese who actually raped, pillaged and oppressed the indigenous peoples of Latin America, because that would amount to hating your own ancestors and your own blood.       Also, Spain and Portugal are far, far away.      So it is the nearby Anglo who must be hated instead. The Anglo who had nothing to do with oppressing indigenous peoples in Latin America.      Oh, sure, Anglos "stole" half of Mexico and rule the roost in this hemisphere the way the Russians rule the roost in their part of the world.      But that doesn't explain the "pass" that is given to the Spanish and Portuguese.      When that communist Hugo Chavez accused a Spanish minister of being fascist, all Juan Carlos -- the king of Spain -- had to do was say, "Why don't you just shut up?"       Chavez was like a chastened little boy. No La Raza rhetoric there. No "We're going to reconquista Spain."      Just a thought.       What do you think?

I engage in contentious even angry (at least on my part) arguments on a nearly daily basis with virtually all of my U.S. compatriots on the topic of socialized healthcare versus profit-oriented-private-enterprise healthcare (Egads! The phrase alone sends shivers down my spine.) For those of you without the benefit of experience, profit-oriented-private-enterprise healthcare is the healthcare system in which a private enterprise with a profit motive determines the care and treatment of the patient, weighing profit and loss against the value of the patient’s life, which quite frequently results in death from routinely curable maladies untreated (at an estimated current annual average of over 10,000). Most Americans love to say, “I don’t want the government assigning me a doctor!” to which I systematically reply, “Right! -because a private enterprise prohibition on all doctors, and subsequent death of routinely curable malady untreated is philosophically so much more palatable.” Believe it or not, that response has NEVER WORKED ONCE on any single American to whom I have presented it. Not that it will ever aid me in any argument with any American, but for my own entertainment value…      The government does not ‘assign’ a doctor or meddle in diagnosis or treatment, right?      You don’t lie on a gurney for two weeks waiting for emergency heart surgery, right?      You have actual hospitals with people in white lab coats, sophisticated modern equipment, electricity and running water indoors, right?      Please help an ignorant ugly American with honest responses from real people.      (Note: I am also struggling to identify the category in which this question belongs. Feel free to make suggestions.)

Democrats - a short summary   Democrats generally support government policies that benefit working class families, seek more corporate regulation, and less government influence over the individual. Democrats favor a government that supports lower and middle-income families and workers through higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy. They strongly support government entitlement programs such as social security and healthcare. In social matters, Democrats emphasize personal choice, privacy, and liberty. They believe that it is the responsibility of the family to promote morals and values in society and not the government's responsibility (this is usually labeled as socially liberal).      Republicans - a short summary   Republicans generally support government policies that benefit large corporations, seek less corporate regulation, and more government influence over the individual. Republicans favor a government that supports corporate America and the wealthy by reducing taxes and regulations on corporations. Republicans believe that reducing corporate taxes and regulations will translate into lower unemployment rates. They would prefer to out-source government entitlement programs such as social security and healthcare to the private sector. In social matters, Republicans believe that the government should make certain moral decisions for us and sometimes see privacy and liberty as a risk to security. They believe that the government should be actively involved with promoting morals and values in society (this is usually labeled as socially conservative).                  What do you think?

My question is, can i have my parents in the room with me when we're negotiating the contratct with the classifier?   I've read some stories in varies few places that say parents have done this with their kids, but my recruiter just told me she's never heard of it happening and is positive it wont be allowed for "legal reasons". She is going to check on it for me though here soon. Honestly sounds like some BS to me since i've heard of it being done. Is it just a case by case basis or what? I'm gunna be at the sacramento MEPS if that makes any difference.   At the end of the day I'd feel a hell of alot better having my parents with me to review a contract thats signing away 5-6 years of my life. I have no doubt that 50 year old seasoned adults will pick up and find things i may have overlooked, maybe even something criticial. Not to mention nobody ever has your best interest at heart more than your own parents.      Thanks

Think of the problems it'll solve: Underage purchase of, for exapmle, alcohol (i'm english, it's 18 here) and also it'll make children focus more on their studies since they won't be paying attention to their hair.       It would be easy to enforce too- just every few weeks, the teacher (or someone else) would give line the childen up and shave, leaving everyone with about a quarter of an inch or whatever. it's practical.      and those who try to disobey could get it all shaved off, and their eyebrows too or something. it could easily work and would be highly beneficial

Right now most Americans would cop out with the excuse that this can't be done, because of the current recession. They would argue we have more pressing issues to worry about. But, I clearly remember 10 years ago, when this economy was booming, Americans weren't interested in paying off the debt then, either. They went out and bought their gas-guzzling SUVs that get 10 miles to a gallon, they took expensive trips to Vegas, and they ordered out 21 times a week.       It seems that most (if not all) Americans live for the moment, and are only concerned with what happens today, not tomorrow. Do Americans really care about paying down the debt? Isn't their attitude to just ignore the problem and let their children worry about it?

My family are fabulous and I love them very much.  I also have absolutely no desire to know my 'birth' parents.   What has bothered me increasingly over the years is my health.  I know nothing of any hereditory diseases and my brother has just been diagnosed with bowel cancer (he is adopted too) at 44 and it bring this again to the fore.   This must be changed and adopted children should be made aware of their 'family' health history.  This should be between shared documents that are totally private and confidential but are shared between health professionals.  My brother's current pain and anguish could have been prevented if there was a history and he had regular screening.   Anyway, can anyone tell me how I would make a start at petitioning for a change in the laws.  I'm 110% committed about this and any advice would be gratefully received!   Thanks   FC

We hold these truths to be self evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim they require a Bill of NON-Rights."             ARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV, or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.             ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended.. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc.; but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.             ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful; do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.             ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes .             ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care.             ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair..             ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.             ARTICLE VIII: You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful. (AMEN!)             ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness, which by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.

I've seen some people mention the deficit created by Obama...and I've seen answers respond by saying the "deficit" is different from the "national debt" or from "debt".      " the amount by which a sum of money falls short of the required amount. "      That's the first meaning taking from the dictionary.  So, if the sum of money falls short, and we spend it anyway, doesn't it become debt??      So, are these people trying to sound smarter than they actually are?? or is there really a difference that I'm not seeing??

Everyone knows that systems integration and interoperability is really important in a disaster scenario.  And yet, the NYFD's radios weren't even compatible ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT, let alone between them and the NYPD, Port Authority, EMS corps, or other agencies.      Why didn't NYC have a robust, interoperable system in service on Sept. 11, 2001?  They knew they really needed one since the World Trade Center attacks in 1993, when confusion also led to a greater number of injuries than necessary.  Except, on 9/11, it was fatalities rather than injuries which took place.      Seems really stupid of NYC to me.  Am I missing something here, or were they really that dumb?

The headline:   Sufi wants Islamic rule worldwide      The link:    http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp...       The money quote:      LAHORE: Tehreek-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat Muhammadi (TNSM) chief Sufi Muhammad, who signed a controversial peace deal with the NWFP government on Monday, said he hated democracy and wanted supremacy of Islam over the entire world.      “From the very beginning, I have viewed democracy as a system imposed on us by the infidels. Islam does not allow democracy or elections,” he told Deutsche Presse-Agentur in an interview held a few days before the government accepted his demand of enforcing sharia in the region. “Had the government accepted our demands in 1994, we would have not seen the violence we are seeing today,” he added. Sufi Muhammad’s son-in-law, Mullah Fazlullah, has fostered the violence in the name of Islam.      Sufi Muhammad said he was against shedding the blood of Muslims, however, added the government should have talked to the Taliban instead of taking military action. He pledged to work for complete peace in Swat if the government enforces Islamic laws, a demand which has now been met.      “I believe the Taliban government formed a complete Islamic state, which was an ideal example for other Muslim countries. Had this government remained intact, it could have led to the establishment of similar Islamic governments in many other countries,” he said.

20090226151453AAv5lNM	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Limbaugh say that Obama violated sanctity of honoring war dead by allowing photogs at Dover?	FACT:     The decision was made by Robert Gates, the defense secretary who was appointed when Bush was president.  No photographs will be taken if it is against the wishes of the fallen soldier's family.   LIE:   RUSH: Breaking news: President Obama has reversed the policy of President Bush, and will now allow media to photograph caskets returning home from war in Afghanistan and Iraq or anywhere else.  So the media will be allowed to photograph returning caskets at Dover, Delaware, when they're brought back to the country. This is just another one of these things he may end up living to regret.  But why do you think he would do that?  Why reverse this? Why do you think the policy is there in the first place?  Well, to you people on the left, "It's because, Mr. Limbaugh, you warmongers want to hide the cost of the lost treasure of our society and our country by having people not see these caskets when they come home from the battlefield!"  The other view is that those caskets are sacred. They are family members.  Those bodies are heroes, and they are honored in private -- or, in some cases, public -- funeral services when they are returned to their families.

20090225112222AAG2GuL	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Police Academy - Decision?	I have come onto a split decision at this point.      I have been an explorer/intern with my Department for about 2 years, and will be 3-5 when I start academy. I have spoken to a few Officers and Sergeants in my department about working there, and they all said I have a greater chance, however all positions are filled at this point. But, I figured, with the turnover rates and the budget cuts, my spot may open before 2.5 years from now.      Here are my decisions;      1) Attend Police Academy in Spring, 2010 and graduate in June 2010, 2 months before I will be 20. This will make me able to provide more to the Explorer/Intern program, and train others, meanwhile remaining an intern doing ride along and patrols with Police Academy knowledge, further advancing my training while awaiting the gracious age of 21 to begin work as a Police Officer. A POST certificate will last for 3 years before expiration, I'll be fine. I will also have obtained my Certificate of Achievement in Criminal Justice before starting academy, and can finish my Associate's Degree after Academy Graduation, as academy makes up for some general education classes.      2) Attend Police Academy in Spring, 2011 and graduate in June 2011, 2 months before I will be 21. This will bring me right up to my 21st birthday, and allow me to become a Police Officer shortly after graduation. I also will have completed my associates degree in criminal justice before going into Police Academy. The downside of this option is having to wait an extra year, and I would not have the Academy experience alongside of the Intern experience before going into the career, that I would have with option 1.      Hopefully I can get your guys' opinion? Everyone would say "Education First!" But hold the 911 phone a second here, option 1 does state I would finish my AS degree AFTER Academy, before i turned 21. So both options, I will obtain my AS before starting work as a Police Officer.      So basically, 1 states that I should go next year and use the training from academy and apply it on the streets as an intern/explorer before going into the career to maximize my training before going into the job, while option 2 states getting all my training and knowledge done now as an intern/explorer, and come out of academy straight into the job.      Opinions? Best answer chosen by in depth explanation, and personal experience.

20090226150734AAm8aEU	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think about William Ayers?	I go to St. Mary's College in the Bay Area, Ca and my school brought William Ayers to give a lecture. It was very controversial, as Ayer's is an unrepented American terrorist responsible for being the leader of the weather underground (bombed NYPD station, pentagon, and other gov property) and the death of a SF police officer. He was arrested but let off because the evidence was obtained without a warrant.      The reason St. Mary's brought him to speak is because he is a leading figure in US education reform. There was a huge protest before his speech and many people were kicked out for disrupting him by shouting out obscenities and yelling some of the evil things he did.       Also, he is responsible for Barrack's political career. He basically put Barrack into his position before Barrack became a senator.       What do you think about St. Mary's for doing this? What do you think about Ayers? Are you afraid of Obama now

I work for a hotel management company and I spend a lot of my time at a particular property (per my boss's request).  Today we let a lady go because there were reports that she was making some of the other staff uncomfortable through her behavior.  While I was terminating her employment she asked if it would be okay if we call the owner (my boss) and I told her that is more than okay.  So we called him and during the conversation she told him that she felt she was being let go because the manager of this property and I were trying to protect our "relationship" with each other.  Nothing more was said about it.  And there is no relationship.  Our company policy states that employee relationships are discouraged and the outcome of such a relationship could result in termination of one or both employees.  I haven't yet had a chance to speak to my boss about this, but this isn't the first time someone has either asked or implied to me that there is something more between myself and this manager (I am his manager and if there was going to be a termination, it would be mine).
