Ab welchem prozentualem Zuwachs an Einkommen würdet ihr euren Arbeitsplatz wechseln? Wenn euch der, den ihr gerade habt, eigentlich gut gef?llt, also das Klima und der Inhalt stimmt.    Würden bei euch Werte wie Loyalit?t, pers?nliche Verbundenheit mit den Kollegen und Identifizierung mit dem Arbeitsinhalt u.U. h?her z?hlen als der reine Mehrverdienst? Bis zu welcher Schmerzgrenze?      Natürlich h?ngt das Ganze auch mit  davon ab, wieviel man cash Kralle am Monatsende rüberbekommt. Dass jemand, der im Monat mit 20 000 Euro Brutto entlohnt wird, vielleicht über 10% nur muede l?chelt, und der andere mit 1000 netto sich über 100 Euro mehr freuen würde wie ein Schneek?nig, ist mir auch klar.

20081008213826AAzvBYz	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What to do with my furnished house back home?	 A couple of years ago I had to relocate to the California Bay Area for my job, where I am now renting a tiny one bedroom apartment, and I still own my house in the original state nearly a thousand miles away. I left all my furniture and the majority of my belongings behind. Now I am realizing that I may never move back, due to the dismal job situation there, and I would like to sell my house, which is costing me an arm and leg in mortgage payments and maintenance every month without even being able to live there. Unfortunately due to the still insanely high real estate prices in the Bay Area (the only area in the country where housing prices have not collapsed and are still going up), it is unlikely that I am going to be able to buy another house here, at least for a few more years.  What should I do with all my stuff back home? I don't have enough space for it here, and shipping alone would cost me a fortune. I live too far to sell it on Craigslist or in a Garage sale, and I am not sure I can sell my house furnished... What should I do? Any ideas? Thanks

20090131143451AAmRZLT	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How to go about selling my home and buying a new one in a different state?	I got accepted to graduate school in a different state and my wife, daughter and I need to move this summer to that state.  I have a house now that I own and I am planning on selling this one and buying a home in the new state where I will be going to school.  My question is this, I am a full time student and my wife works full time.  When we move to the new state, my wife will become a full time stay at home mom and I am going to be going to graduate school full time so I probably will only be able to have a part time job.  We have enough equity in our current home to put a nice size down payment for the new home but I don't know how to go about selling this home and buying the new one.  If I'm not mistaken, I will need to show the loan officers in the new state that I have a job but I will only have a part time job because I will have tuition reimbursement and housing assistance from the school.      So, how do I go about selling this home here, and then buying a home there and getting the lowest interest rate possible there.  Both my wife and I have very good credit scores so I know that will help because neither of us has ever defaulted on a loan in the 10 years we have both had credit.  Can I buy a home in the new state with my equity from this house and not have a time where we wouldn't be living in either house.  I don't want to have to move twice because of selling our home, then living somewhere and then moving into the new house.  Anyone have suggestions?

20070111102949AA8C25M	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Having a hard time connecting with my boss.  Any suggestions?	I just started with this company, haven't even been here a year. A few months ago was transfered to a different dept., while an employee was out on medical leave the manager decided to keep me as his Assistant.  I was just starting to fit in, was happy in the other dept., was doing the same for work, just for another manager. Company adjustments made the option of going back, not an option.  I am struggling to fit in with this new project team.  I was happy, now I am not so sure, it's like starting my first day all over again, I want to make this work but am out of ideas of what to try next.  I think I would feel better if I could at least connect with my new manager.  We get along but without that foundation of  connection I feel I don't have any stable ground to build a successful relationship. I'm not sure if subconsciously if I am struggling with him being younger than I.  My other bosses have been older and had no problems with any of them.

20081105193332AAqXTFZ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	My husband just lost his job.....?	I think we're both still in shock. It's weird because I just questioned him about his job security and he was so confident. He's in the oil and plastics industry. Who'da thunk?      Anyways, my question is.....how do I be there for him now? I'm a stay at home Mom of two kids - a full-time kindergartener and a part-time preschooler who's 3 years old. I am willing (and now eager) to get a job but haven't worked in 6 years. He wants me to get a job. I think he wants to know he's got some back up. Don't blame him. Me too. How else do I help? Leave him alone? Bake him treats? Sex? Uh, duh. Just kidding about that one. I just know that men like to go into their caves, for the most part. He says he feels like a failure. He's not and he knows I don't think he is. His company shut down his side. He's simply been laid off. It's happening everywhere and I knew we weren't immune.      I'm scared, too, though. Never been through this before. Any kind words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Also, any advice and/or ideas about me getting a job would be great. I have only an AA and not much work experience within the last 6 years.      Thanks all.

20090131094049AAzwdnz	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Should I refile my federal taxes, even though the return amount will not be affected?	I filed my state (GA) and federal taxes and have done received my rebate from both of them, but I got a letter from my student loan provider that showed I paid in $1,136.25 of interest to them instead of the $425 I put down on my taxes.  I wasn't sure I was going to get the form from the lender because I have moved a few times in the last year and just tried to calculate the amount of interest on my own, (should have just called, but didn't even think about it then).  I received the maximum amount of my return from federal and this will not gain me anymore money from federal, but is it beneficial to go ahead and file and amendment, or should I just not worry about it for federal since I have already received my return and the maximum amount that I could have received?    I am going to file the amendment for state because it does increase the amount of the return I should receive, but just wondering what to do about federal?
