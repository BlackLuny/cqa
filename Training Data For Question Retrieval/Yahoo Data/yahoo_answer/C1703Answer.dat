bqkfu6Diaa	There is no excuse to deliver a beating that bad. I mean, let's say she did something extremely horrible like jabbing him with an HIV infected needle. I could understand her deserving a mighty punishment. But even if she deserved it, that doesn't mean he should do it, especially in such a fashion. What he allegedly did was career suicide. Anything she could have possibly done to him to upset him was not nearly as bad as what he did to himself. So if he did actually beat her to the degree that we saw in the pic on TMZ, he was wrong for doing so and should learn a life lesson to NEVER do that again. She deserves justice, and he deserves punishment. He does not deserve to be crucified over this however. He is young, made a really dumb mistake, and all parties involved will survive and should be able to get over it. Hopefully, many other men out there will learn that even though a woman can hit you and deserve to get hit back, you do not HAVE to do it. You can defend yourself without causing her physical harm. It is possible to do even though it may not be technically fair. In the long run, it will be much better for everyone involved.|`|vemSTfwAaa	everyone should keep their hands to themselves period. If she did hit him first, that's not cool but i don't think she could have done anything so bad as to deserve the beating she got. But i don't like this attitude that girls should be able to hit guys and guys just have to stand there and take it. if a girl hit me, i wouldn't punch her or hit or anything but I will defend myself. if that means pushing her away from me or restraining her, then so be it.|`|lgBLl9gnaa	Oh my God - you've got people saying he shouldn't have beaten her "THAT bad..." so what they're trying to rationalize is that, less physical damage would have been OK, depending on the circumstances Chris Brown was presented with?

fFnsJ7maaa	The Feds will track down what they can, from Madoff, his family and friends, as well as from other people in his company. They will also "Clawback" money from investors who received distributions. <br>  <br>  Say you invested $100K. Over the years, your money "grew" to $300K. You cashed out last year, and Madoff sent you a check for $300K. The Feds can make you return that money, clawing it back. <br>  <br>  That $100K that you put in and thought had grown to $300K -- that $200K profit never existed. A large percent of what people "lost" was those phantom profits. (When people say they lost $200 million, they don't say if they sent checks to Madoff totaling $200 million, or that was what they thought they had in their account.) Either way, the Feds will eventually tally up what people put in, they'll figure out what percentage of the total that was, they'll add up the total they found, and they'll distribute it to those investors.

The definition is the global exchange of goods and services.<br>  <br>  Basically, the economic crisis at the moment is happening because the world economy is slowing down - we are going into what's known as a 'recession'. This means that people all over the world are losing their jobs and people have less money. It's mostly due to the stock exchange - a bit like the effects of the Wall Street Crash (although hopefully not as severe) if you study history.<br>  <br>  I hope that explained it to you.|`|B0XARuLVaa	It's going to be like World War III and the U.S. and many other countries are going to be devastated, only there won't be bombs and destruction.

It usually takes 4.  I feel sorry for the greedy people who were too stupid to read the print on the documents they signed and bought above what they could afford.  The bankers are also guilty for being greedy by giving these people the loans when they knew they were buying something they could not afford.

NkEHCHsOaa	The news media is run by elite billionaire democrats and their world has evolved around misleading the public into voting for democrats. If mexicans or arabs or even black people do something heinous they shut it right down and you don't hear about it. It's part of sculpting public perception in a way to help democrats win, when if people really understood what was going on, the democrat party would cease to exist, and that can't be allowed by the ultra rich elite because democrats are putting down the rest of us so they can live like a ruling class royal group.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	You are correct.

cwkttTXxaa	You have to have a basically honest culture for whistle blowers to succeed.  No one listened in the Madoff case either.  I think GW knew and appointed to powerful positions some greedy, rich crooks or narcissists.  How ironic it is that our country was taken down by its own government, not the terrorists who threatened to ruin our economy The selfish, stingy right are more dangerous to us than bin Ladin.  I believe over the last 69 years the liberals have proved to be the more honest and honorable than the right wing "believers".|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Unfortunately, a lot of companies operate this way even if they mince it with nice words.<br>  <br>  This way is "sell our product, even if you have to lie about it."  It's not a completely new phenomenon nor will it be the last.
FvMtam2Aaa	I believe what you are saying may be true. Kinda hard to understand.  We are fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq and not necessarily the people or government.  These freedom fighters or what every they are called stir up conflict in other cultures.  They are light sewer rats and travel from site to site.  They can stir up the general public and promote further conflict.

Shameful...<br>  <br>  They have lied to cover their back and in my opinion a 92 year old bares NO resemblance to a drug addict/dealer.<br>  <br>  They should have the book thrown at them for this so called mistake!|`|1T35X8dEaa	I think they will, either that or they will get shot. Oh wait two of them charged were shot, most likely by each other.<br>  <br>  "Police initially said that Kathryn Johnston fired at them with an old pistol, and they shot back in self-defense."<br>  <br>  <br>  I would shoot too at people breaking down the door of my house, if I lived alone and was 92 years old.<br>  <br>  It is a sad story and crimes committed by Police should never be overlooked.|`|AA10153636	A lot of real dangerous Seniors out there..<br>  Probably had a tough time bringing her down, she was so well armed.  <br>  Maybe in the future they could just bomb the houses and kill all the occupants, makes as much sense..|`|hZIVKiFdaa	If it's anything like the justice system in the UK, the officers would probably only receive a caution and be moved to another dept.|`|tguEmxVyaa	Nothing will be done to the cops..

L8zmQS8Jaa	As shark did not direct his response to the central issue, I add my comments:  Your question implies the question "shall we as a nation have full and complete disclosure or should we as a nation have "watchdogs" who will be privileged with secret information and decide what is best for us to know."1<br>  <br>  Did the media fail Beverly Eckert?  Well, that depends upon your view of the responsibility they owed to her or her memory.  At least they included the notation that she was on the plane and some of her back story.  That alone would have been enough to get some people thinking.  Either way I am left with the feeling of having just eaten tainted food.  <br>  <br>  But if you believe that having rights also requires responsibilities then the media has failed the American people.  The media, for the most part, is a private institution that must abide by owners rights for a profit.  It is easy to see how this could pull media to report what owners and advertisers want to be reported.  But the media is also the only private institution protected by the Constitution (in the 1st Admendment to the Bill of Rights.)  We can't force the media to act responsibily any more than we can force a bystander to help a dying man.  We can only consider it morally reprehensible. 2 <br>  <br>  The first admendment is not idle wishful thinking.  It is done for a reason.  Freedom is not like some asteroid that falls in our midst from the heavens although it is often treated in this fashion by the masses.  Freedom depends upon freedom of choice.  A choice that is based upon less than complete information is not free.  It is only the parody of freedom.  It is a rubber stamp of approval to those giving the information.  It is the motion without substance, a slight of hand, a sham, a swindle, and a shame on all of us for allowing it to happen.   <br>  <br>  It didn't happen with current events.  It was happening 20 years ago or more when laws dis-allowing joint ownership of media outlets were relaxed.  One of the surest ways to a facist government (3) is to allow media to be in the hands of a few.  How far we are along that tract is another question for individual reflection.<br>  <>|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	we got caught with our pant's down - now the people in charge are embarrassed. <br>  There were no explosives waiting to be detonated.There was no CIA conspiracy.
AA10199189	you are not in the wrong field - you need a change of beat and/or shift, and a holiday.<br>  <br>  as for the bad news - why not jump over to features? profiles? business can have areas that don't deal as much with the immediate news, sports has areas in which one can write in-depth articles, or - if your paper has a community outreach person, you might consider applying for one of those jobs in which you are at large in the community. (or a reporter at large).<br>  <br>  you should decide fairly soon whether you wish to continue in reporting, because it will take you some time to establish yourself in whatever other job you take.<br>  <br>  once i worked 'way too many hours in one week and as i finally walked home all i could hear was the phone ringing in my head - almost quit that day. but two days later another paper snatched me away with a better job.  you never know what comes around the next corner.<br>  <br>  as for bandett who thinks the media are the worst thing on the planet - remember that it is our job to report the news and news, by definition, is going to make someone very unhappy.<br>  as for his statement that california is bankrupt and nobody reports on the cause, here's the cause:  all those idiots voting proposition after proposition not to pay more taxes.  where the hell does he think government money comes from?  does saying that make the media left-wing? no, it makes the media truthful.<br>  <br>  and perhaps it is depressing to have to report on this, but it's the time you are living in, and it's what shapes the country and its people..  <br>  decide to stay in journalism. <br>  decide to report the truth as free of bias as possible.  <br>  and leave those who want nothing but entertainment to their websites and tv stations.|`|UQWusO1waa	your right, i look at the news on my comp. and it is all the same stuff on every site.  with stupid head lines,titles. and forget the tv news they are even worse. I hate to remind you of this because im prob talking about you. but so much of the print media is left wing and write everything with a bias an agenda. all the victims etc. no real reporting. you know , bridge falls down, and they say need more taxes. not where all road tax was spent. california is bankrupt and not a word about why. it is all just fluff and worse misleading . As to your " i  want to see action being taken in our country" I think  would be interesting to report why the taxes are not used as they were intended, Why is there so much corruption and lies when it comes to taxes and how they are spent. This is so important for the future of our country , because we are being lied to constantly. government at all levels feeds itself first, and continues to grow at alarming rates. like 100% in 8 years, we will never be able to survive this. It is choking us to death.  But if you start writing things like that , things people want and need to hear. you paper will prob. shut you down. Because they love more government, more taxes, more welfare, more spending bla bla bla , never mind. I guess you just need to find a new outlet for your talents. I agree with you it has all become tabloid news.EDIT  YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN ? THE GUY  MR. K ,SAYS THE PROBLEM IS NOT ENOUGH TAXES, EVEN WHEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF HIGHEST TAXED STATES AND MANY tax payers and companies have left Ca for that reason.  No bias in the media ???? Theres your proof. He did not offer any solution to calif bankruptcy except that people are not taxed enough. how dense some people are is really mind blowing. reduce the tax base then keep rasing the taxes untill all the tax payer are gone. pure genuis !!!!

Remember your passion for the truth. Read Noam Chomsky on the US media and devote yourself to the truth rather than to making a lot of money.<br>  <br>  You will be fired if you tread outside the limits defined by the media, but that's OK. Wouldn't you rather enjoy driving a taxi and having time to write what people most need to understand?<br>  <br>  Look at the drivel media tells us about, and come up with the truth and find your own outlet, even if that means just a few hundred people in your community.<br>  <br>  By the way, driving a taxi is good honest work. Being in PR and writing spin (lies)  for a misdirected bad company is soul draining.<br>  <br>  Would you really want to promote "milk is good food" when cow protein, genetically engineered bovine growth hormone, and antibiotics make American milk a health hazard?

The earlier you have sex - the more likley you are to get cancer. <br>  <br>  However, they have put the age at 25 because of cost cutting (I beleive)

Kpn8pghfaa	I would give a shovel to all the apologists who say - "well it only happens once every 18 years - why should we spend any time or money preparing for it?"     If they don't think they should prepare for it - then they should just deal with it when it happens and start clearing some snow themselves, instead of having a day off.    I live in a part of the country which does get snow more than once in 18 yrs.  When it snows, the major roads are gritted and we use grit and salt to help clear our own pavements and pathways.  We don't stay at home and whinge that the nanny state didn't do it all for us.  AND, If we want time off to enjoy the snow, we do it in our time, not our employer's.      And for those who say " yeah but you're used to it - we're not - so we deserve a holiday.."  get a grip... the country's in recession... can you and the rest of us really afford the loss of revenue?    It's a bit tiresome listening to the media (especially the so-called national media aka the BBC), going on ad nauseum about a few inches of snow. Incredibly, the BBC had a video on their website of people slipping on the icy steps at Waterloo station! - how childish is that? - why didn't those who filmed it warn people to be careful instead of filming them falling!    We've had 2 days worth of "woohoo - let's all have a day off work/school etc".  Surely the novelty must wear off soon?  What happens if the snow continues for a week or more - could the south-east really afford to have a long holiday until the weather improves?    rant over.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	The simple answer is be prepared, they have known for weeks that the snow was coming and yet this country still comes to a standstill. Schools close, why, simply because people will not go out into the snow.  This never happened when I was young, I wish it had I would not have minded a day off school.  I like the snow so see no problem with walking to work (which I have done) or school in the snow. Granted some places the snow was feet deep and it was difficult to get out until the snow plough came along. We just cannot handle the snow in this country and I do not know why, hells bells and buckets of sand its not as if it never snows here!  Some people just see snow outside and then think that's it not going to work and do not bother to make the effort.    Although I have said be prepared, it still is not the answer, we just cannot seem to cope in this country with a little thing called snow.|`|EEpBrsSnaa	I would have told them all the about the winters i lived through when I were a lad......  25 miles walk to school through 50 foot of snow with no shoes. We never complained....lol|`|HUlyRTrraa	London could easily be equipped with the machinery and technology to beat a snow storm but they are so rare the cost outweighs the need.    It is just how it is in London when it snows. We can live with it,so that's all that matters.    Why does it bother you so much that London was running on the back burner yesterday? Did it affect your stocks & shares?    Edit. Well the company I work for was up and running. They can work remotely from home with laptops and mobile phones but what is the point of say a Cafeteria opening ? There were no customers around.....The Cafeteria would have lost out in overhead costs . See ?|`|DYdXrVVeaa	told every1 to hav fun and get over it - the snow wasnt that bad|`|bYtCfdwbaa	I was in New York  once when overnight it got a couple of feet of snow.It was amazing how quickly everything was up and running again.I disagree that Britain doesn't get enough snow to warrant spending a load on equipment.There's over a billion a day being lost.It's false economy not to equip yourself to counter that sort of loss.What if they got a month of bad snow?Economically it would be a disaster.If other countries can cope with heavy snowfalls Britain has no excuse.  The gritters should have been working flat out before that snow came in.Councils should have hired extra workers to clear snow.  Schools should not just automatically close at the sign of a snowflake.They should be open for whoever can make it in to school so that parents who both work can still go to work.The country shouldn't just fold every time there's a bit of snow.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	I don't think Boris did bad at all.  Naturally, Red Ken tried to capitalize on the situation, and it took our minds off the credit crunch.  This was the first time we had had so much snow for 18 years.  I don't think it would be prudent to spend millions to try to guard against something that is only likely to happen once or twice in a generation.|`|0Fd28wlYaa	told everyone to get over it, the snow wasnt that bad, there wasnt even that much of it. everyones just making something out of nothing.|`|4048ad82d67909905629720173b0aa1caa	WE DO NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM OFTEN SO IT WOULD MEAN LOTS OF MONEY WASTED TO PREPARE LIKE THE RUSSIANS DO.|`|LyoKmnZZaa	make it stand still until the snow stops as I don't want any injuries|`|0c4e15c486b73273241480268ab82ce4aa	I would have told them to tough it out.

AA11305474	I am so outraged that I spent the morning emailing the governator and our representatives in Sacto.  I have been plaguing them with emails since this budget debaucle began, but this is the worst possible outcome!  It really irritates me that they reached into the pockets of those of us who are still hanging on to our jobs and homes, but can barely keep ourselves from falling off the proverbial financial cliff.  We have seen increases in food, electric, water, trash collection to the tune of 30-35% in the last year, losses of 35-40% in our home values, IRAs, 401ks and investment accounts and our wages have been stagnant or barely able to keep up with the increases in health care premiums or co-pays.  In order to pay the increased personal income tax, we will have to save every dime of the $13 in federal stimulus and will still owe about $1300 to the state.  In addition, the increase in vehicle license fees, sales taxes and other provisions will only serve to slow down purchases because consumers will tighten the purse strings even more.  What burns me most is that they never even discusses suspending free services for the education, health care, social services or welfare to anchor babies of illegals.  There is a huge sigh of relief in the illegal alien community that at least they will not be affected by the income tax increases while they still retain their free benefits while all of us taxpaying suckers get less government services and huge tax increases.  Even my avatar is red faced with the passage of this budget!  Did you notice, they basically snagged everything we could have gotten that might have benefitted us from the fed?  We won't be able to take advantage of purchasing energy efficient appliances, solar panels, wind generators, new cars and can't even spend our stimulus because we will owe it to the state.|`|NS3BxXEmaa	hope things get better<br>  for california|`|BkatcMZbaa	Eskie & Debijs are really hot up to the burning point and I understand it as a common tax payer and lucky to be out of it now as in my country, annual income of less than $30,000 is out of taxation...(low & no income earner).  Currently my Eastern World is a little better than the West and most of the high prices are coming down now to ease out the situation.<br>  <br>  Our GST (consumer tax of 7% as like VAT in UK ) is on and no change but the Govt gives a rebate amount to all citizen to off-set the tax (a flexible measure only).  Transport cost cut with reduction and a fixed hand-out to low income earner to tie-over in small portion.<br>  <br>  The Govt main returns are revenue & taxation but need to know well how to play the game to the tune i.e. soften music to feel easy & hard rock for the KICK and there is still the need to face the MUSIC, right?<br>  <br>  Education & Common Understanding will play the part to ease the feeling & the condition.........please bear with it and look at the far end of the horizon for the bright sunshine & warm to come.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	yes i am...

9SB2Y5r8aa	Palestine   >>>  Palestinians are Freedom fighters to liberate Palestinians people and land from israeli occupation       Israel       http://www.alqassam.ps/english/?action=s...|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	both, but in the right place.|`|DtlQawvgaa	Palestine has never existed . . . as an autonomous entity. There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc.     The word itself derives from "Peleshet", a name that appears frequently in the Bible and has come into English as "Philistine". Philistines was migrant people from the Aegean Sea and the Greek Islands who settled on the southern coast of the land of Canaan. There they established five independent city-states (including Gaza) on a narrow strip of land known as Philistia. The Greeks and Romans called it "Palastina".     The Philistines were not Arabs, they were not Semites. They had no connection, ethnic, linguistic or historical with Arabia or Arabs. The name "Falastin" that Arabs today use for "Palestine" is not an Arabic name. It is the Arab pronunciation of the Greco-Roman "Palastina" derived from the Peleshet.     In the First Century CE, the Romans crushed the independent kingdom of Judea. After the failed rebellion of Bar Kokhba in the Second Century CE, the Roman Emperor Hadrian determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea. Therefore, he took the name Palastina and imposed it on all the Land of Israel. At the same time, he changed the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina.    After the Roman conquest of Judea, "Palastina" became a province of the pagan Roman Empire and then of the Christian Byzantine Empire, and very briefly of the Zoroastrian Persian Empire. In 638 CE, an Arab-Muslim Caliph took Palastina away from the Byzantine Empire and made it part of an Arab-Muslim Empire. The Arabs, who had no name of their own for this region, adopted the Greco-Roman name Palastina, that they pronounced "Falastin".     During the First World War, the British took Palestine from the Ottoman Turks. At the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and among its subject provinces "Palestine" was assigned to the British, to govern temporarily as a mandate from the League of Nations.    The Balfour Declaration of 1917, confirmed by the League of Nations Mandate, commited the British Government to the principle that "His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish National Home, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. . . . " It was specified both that this area be open to "close Jewish settlement" and that the rights of all inhabitants already in the country be preserved and protected.     During the period of the Mandate, it was the Jewish population that was known as "Palestinians" including those who served in the British Army in World War II.     The current myth is that these Arabs were long established in Palestine, until the Jews came and "displaced" them. The fact is, that recent Arab immigration into Palestine "displaced" the Jews. That the massive increase in Arab population was very recent is attested by the ruling of the United Nations: That any Arab who had lived in Palestine for two years and then left in 1948 qualifies as a "Palestinian refugees".     God Bless!|`|RkBlMyHRaa	Israel, as they are the ones who are peaceful.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.

Ehgfz5nNaa	His twist on the Guantanamo bay prisoners and sending of additional two brigades to Afghanistan seem to be exactly opposite of what he said in his pre- election speeches, you are right the Media influences the brain|`|AA10682405	No president is ever going to be what they promise to be. The "change" card was easy for Obama to play because nobody wanted a repeat of Bush. In regards to actions though, I highly doubt that Obama will be anything special. He's going to be just like every other president, and he will make mistakes that the media will either cover up, or over-exaggerate, depending on which side they choose. Nobody's going to hear about all the things he does wrong OR all the things he does right, because the media never wants to give us the truth. So whether he turns out better or worse than Bush, we'll pretty much only find out when we see what state our country is in in 4 years time.  I wouldn't trust the media for anything.|`|AA10527991	I truly believe that Obama will not only be different from Bushit but that he'll go down in history as a great President.  Bushit will finally be able to do something Warren G. Harding's family has been waiting a long time for: Harding is no longer considered the second worst President in US history (no one can do worse than Nixon).|`|suKoM2owaa	if you lived here in south africa you'lld think obama was jesus christ come back, or maybe some new age bhuddha. these guys are just raving on and on about him like he's going to really change anything. i think obama is just like any other american president...full of empty words|`|115508459f8cc5e89fe50b1f0bf40231aa	The media ,no,But his action so far has proved that he can walk his talk. He loves his country.|`|AA11688085	we're basically going to be in washington's 55th term|`|JIvqkQrOaa	I'm not sold on either party's platform. Some of each. But I disagree with you 100% that this will be anything like we had with Bush. I think Obama is right about spending money on infrastructure which is badly needed, will put alot of people to work, and give the tax payers something solid for our money, instead of doling it out to banks who maybe should go under. We can all be replaced, they tell us, why not big business. Obama is a smart man that will think things through, so that's a big difference in the 2 Presidents right there! The Media is so slanted in the US-it is a large part of the problem and why our country has become so divided. Screw the parties! Let's try common sense! Such as not spending more than you're bringing in!|`|hQHWVRyTaa	I only believe half of what the media tells me, and then I watch nature shows.    Obama will be worse than Bush dreamed of fantasizing of the possibility of being. I say this because he supports partial birth abortions. Why is that?|`|hPQurfluaa	Not yet impressed.|`|a375l0D7aa	The media did not fool me, no. But somehow there is a vast national feeling that whatever you are for, Obama is in favor of it as well. An interesting illustration of this is raised by the person who says that Obama's planned "surge" in Afghanistan and closing the prison in Gitmo is contrary to his campaign speeches. He actually promised both. In addition, he promised to bomb Pakistan. Another answer says that we must cut spending, yet in his campaign Obama outlined a huge government spending program for national health care, infrastructure building, an a negative income tax.  Be prepared also as he promised to raise our electric bills.    The Media is in part to blame for this of course. We have elected a man about whom very little is known and who so far has never had to take much of a leadership role on the tough questions. When he has taken a leadership role, he has been proven wrong (example: the recent peaceful elections in Iraq could not have taken place except for the war and the surge in Iraq that he opposed.)    The Media also is in part to blame for the country's general dislike of G. W. Bush. His record of 7 years of economic growth was ignored as he Media tried to make Iraq into a no-win war.    Obama is not as great as the media portrayed. Bush is not as evil as the media portrayed.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	I wasn't fooled 2 years ago when he started talking of running for the Presidency. I started looking at his record then and noticed a firm lack of experience.  Since actions speak louder than words, any thing he said, I scrutinized, and dug for the truth.  I did not believe him then and do not believe him now.  Media has no influence in my life.  America is in deep trouble with this person at the helm.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Sorry.

LWzrCu5caa	300 MILLION Americans x $5000 each.... =  $1.5 TRILLION dollars.   Where is the money going to come from?<br>  <br>  The problem is that since the Democrats took the USA off the silver standard back in 1964,  deficit spending has become the norm in Washington.  They spend money today assuming taxes and inflation will allow them to pay it back tomorrow.  <br>  <br>  But with any Ponzi scam,  and that is all this is,  sooner or latter "tomorrow" does not work out the way you planned and there is no more money coming in.   That is where we are now.  Besides Washington spending money it did not have,  the Democrats rigged Fannie and Freddie so they made loans to people who would not have the money "tomorrow" either.<br>  <br>  The whole credit based economy is collapsing and Obama things MORE CREDIT is going to fix it.   It may postpone it but when the collapse finally comes,  it is going to be worse off due to his actions.   <br>  <br>  What he should have done is reined in government.  With government spending less money the people would have more money from their paychecks.  And they would have spent the money on what they needed or wanted and not on what Uncle Sam wants.   Also with more fiscal responsibility in Washington it would have ensured foreign nations would have kept loaning us money. Now what may happen is they stop and then we are in a whole lot more hurt.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	No. It will just cause the price of everything to rise steeply.

A lot of people might just decide to save the money instead of spending it.  Even if they "require" that it be spent, the people can just withdraw it and keep the money at home.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	If the government doesn't give the money, then it would stimulate inflation. We'd buy something today, and tomorrow it'd double in price.|`|0wAZQdvyaa	Nope, most people would pay off credit or 'save it for a rainy day' and then a good deal would gamble it,|`|D8rjkxBTaa	Sounds good to me.

D7QP6vBKaa	Competition of stocking nuclear weapons started in the west was a outcome of cold-war. Both Communist & US fronts stocked nukes to show their strengths to each other. But note that, no nuclear weapon was used after Nagasaki, even in worst situations. Becoz they know it is not logical to actually 'use' nukes, considering it will only destroy warring sides.       Possibly West doesn't have much faith on Iran, considering their strong anti-US, anti-Israel & anti-UK mentality. But the biggest fear of them is possibly that Islamic terrorists might get nukes. I don't think any Iranian govt will ever use nukes, becoz then they will have to face unwanted consequences from International community. But the Islamic radicals have always strong influence in Iranian administration, who are not under control of west. Possibly West fears some of them may supply nukes to the terrorists.      Personally I doesn't consider making nukes is 'glorifying' act. It's a weapon mainly targeting the common population, not the enemy force, which I think is a crime.

Well, here is a serious answer.      No one, although they will never admit it, not even the U.SA. nor Russia wants to use the nukes.  The only reason why they still kept them was to serve as a threat and as a deterrent against each other.  That was until the 1990s.  They saw the collateral damage it did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the residual effects on its survivors.  They knew that each, both countries would never have a civilization as they knew it, after a nuke exchange.    Now, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and some other countries have them as well.  These are countries that had produced or copied the technologies for defense purposes or political pressure of those who oppose them or threaten them.    Now Iran had been, since the Ayatollah, been a radical extremist Islamic country.  The view, and mind you I stress the word view, is that this country will not merely use this as a defensive tool.  They have no perceived enemy except the former Iraq under Saddam Hussein and today he is no longer leader of that country.  Iraq is struggling to contain an internal civil war of several tribes to be able to threaten Iran in any serious manner as before.    Therefore, developing a nuclear arsenal at this point in time only means that it will be intended as an aggressive weapon, which other countries view as a potential problem; specially Israel which Iran had publicly threatened.|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	china, India, Pakistan, and israel got it.  why it is not allowed for Iran to have it.|`|UVVce5hTaa	Iran gets nukes, the rest of the world gets the Caspian Gulf.

Shahar12:  You are talking about localized pollution, which is a local problem, not a global one.  Go twenty miles outside any city and the air is clean and the shy is blue.  Most of the pollution you are refering to is heavier than air, that is why it blankets the city in smog, it never reaches the upper atmosphere, you don't get acid rain out in the country, only in cities and their suburbs.

If you've been listening to the news, you'll have heard that this is the most snow the UK has had for 18 years - and really, it's not that much is it.  Just because we have had a couple of days of weather like we're supposed to in winter, doesn't mean that we can suddenly relax, or that global warming is not a fact.    If you were an aware person and are over the age of 25, then you'll have witnessed global warming on your doorstep - the horse chestnut trees are dying (from a bug that's usually killed in our winters but hasn't been for years), roses blooming in November, buds springing out in December. When I was a child in 1980 the river Thames almost completely froze over - that was a regular occurance in the years before that apparently.  It hasn't happened since.    I don't know about you - but I doubt polar bears like crashing through the ice and drowning...    It's scary I know, but I'm afraid it is happening.  Denying it or burying your head in the ground won't make it go away.

Why?    Because the gulf stream sends up warm water which keeps the UK and Western Europe free of really cold weather, however global warming will send the gulf stream further north.    The result of this will be Western Europe getting the weather they should ie Moscow and Northern America. It will actually get much colder here due to global warming.|`|lxeGKjLbaa	Global warming doesn't mean that there isn't cold weather anymore, it indicates that there are more exteme temperatures in general. You may have snow, but my town has just had the longest and highest heat wave temps in its history! And every year it's getting hotter. Farmers can't feed their dying livestock because there hasn't been any rain for months so they're shooting livestock and then shooting themselves. I agree with you that the politicians may use more energy than the rest of us and are wasting time thinking and not acting. I don't think it's a bandwagon, I think it's long overdue.

I'm not a politician, nor am I planning to be one.|`|ufItSQsZaa	Cars drive through thick smog on a street in Beijing  in September 2008 (AFP/File/Peter Parks)   With the Olympics over, China is back in business. That means the choking pollution is back from all the coal-fired power plants and industrial companies. The U.N. reported that a huge thick brown cloud of soot, particles and chemicals stretches from the Persian Gulf to Asia threatening the health of the people living there. Cities such as Cairo, New Delhi, Mumbai, Cairo, Beijing and Shanghai have there light dimmed by as much as 25%.    The brown cloud traps heat in the atmosphere, contributes to the melting of Himalayan glaciers, and causes weather extremes that threaten to reduce crop production in the area.    The World Energy Outlook 2008 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that China and India will account for just over half of the increase in world primary energy demand between 2006 and 2030. Middle Eastern countries will account for an 11% incremental increase in world energy demand. A lot of this new energy use in India and China will come from dirty energy sources like coal.    China and India are trying to grow their economies very rapidly, which consumes huge amounts of energy. China is already the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, having passed the United States just recently. At 10% per year growth, they could double their emissions in the next 7 years!    This is a serious problem for the entire world. I hope that our new president will make a serious effort to address these global environmental challenges soon after he takes office. A way needs to be found to get these emissions under control and will probably involve our helping countries like China and India develop more of their energy from clean renewable resources.|`|127d772b732ca4f45b50ef7ec289389daa	'Arctic' conditions here in the South-East of England are NOT inconsistent with what is commonly referred to as 'Global warming'. The Arctic Ocean warms up and melts the polar ice-cap. Huge quantities of 'fresh' water empty into the Arctic Ocean diluting the salt content and pushing Icebergs further south into the Atlantic Ocean. As a consequence, the 'Gulf Stream' coming out of the Gulf of Mexico (which keeps the seas around our coast warmer than they otherwise would be) is diverted further South and/or turned 'off' altogether - hence the South of England would experience weather conditions similar to those in Ontario Canada - which incidentally is on the same latitude as the South of England.|`|InGWARz9aa	You r so right lol xxx|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Anecdotal evidence like this doesn't refute global warming.

They have a sizeable minority of Muslims - over 10% that routinely terrorizes the majority who don't have the guts put them in their place.  As in the west, there are Indian politicians who put their own interests above the country's and pander to Muslims, so yes, the Islamist pockets will grow larger and larger in India too.<br>  <br>  Look how they've succeeded in England - you have labor party leaders who they have eating out of their palms like dogs, because the breed prolifically and are a sizeable voting block.|`|DEglvDGDaa	Yes they will unless they are wiped off the face of the earth now the taliban scum will spread their hate and death around the world|`|NRkQ0OEsaa	I think the fight will spread into parts of Pakistan but not India, India is to strong for a bunch of bam pots to take over.|`|nddmwDAmaa	No. I don't think so.

The government coming in would never allow an Arab to represent Israel, and arabs inside Israel, and in zones under Israeli dictatorship do not have the same rights as jews.<br>  <br>  For example, the West bank is being built upon by jewish settlers under the Israeli military, and the Israeli government is building schools, hospitals and roads that only the jewish settlers can use.<br>  <br>  This is no worse than the apartheid, and no worse than the "whites only" signs we used to see in america, and across the west.<br>  <br>  The reason why there is criticism is because it is pure hypocrisy and an outright farce that Israel asks an arab to represent them.

AA10153220	-It's a memorial for someone who has passed away.  There are two kinds: those families pay to have put in the paper, and those written about notable figures.    -Usually a few days after the person's death.    -Families/friends/loved ones write them to announce a death and memorialize the person who died.  Journalists write them to talk about an influential person, and because peoples' lives make good stories.    -People like to read obituaries because they're succinct, interesting summaries of the lives of others.

Honestly, I have high hopes for the future. Let's be honest, it may take his whole term to get things going; with the way the economy is and how bad things are, this isn't something that will just reverse itself just as Obama moves into office. It will take time to sort through 8 years of bad decisions and start back on the right path.<br>  <br>  To the poster that said "We're screwed", seriously, think of something better. Aside from "omg America is now a socialist country" people are so quick to say that we're screwed. In all honesty, I'd go all in on Obama over McCain any day of the week. As a young college student, Obama has inspired me to new heights, and I'm sure he has done so to so many other young people in despair and uncertainty.|`|oZ2E7fhSaa	Despite the pre-election hype he has started with a string of dubious appointments of people who have a cloud over them. Far from the "change" he has appointed a number of former Clinton staffers. Bush managed to turn Iraq around (never gets credit from left wing press) but Obama could mess it up by leaving too early. Obama is now pouring troops into Afghanistan where they will get bogged down leading to disaster. I trust the New York times will publish a body count of the unfortunate US troops who will pay the price for this man's "Jimmy Carter" liberalism. We are about to witness a re-igniting of militant Islam which is already feeling empowered by a US administration they consider to be weak.<br>  As for his monetary/financial policies, the less said the better. Buy yourself a big wheelbarrow because that is what you'll need to cart your money to the supermarket. Your great grandchildren are being saddled with debt and the interest on the trillions being spent will be greater than the cost of the Iraq war,|`|52dee74776fc6edfa71a657ab4ee67acaa	that depends on who you speak to.  those who think bush did a fabulous job will tell you no.  those who can't get over thinking about anything outside of their own little bubble will tell you no.  <br>  <br>  I believe he is doing an amazing job - he is honest, he talks to people, he explains and listens, he is fair.. he has a lot of crap to clean up after the last 8 years and there's no easy way to do that.  I believe he's doing very well with the mess that's been given him.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am SO excited to see what else he will do and I stand firmly behind him.<br>  <br>  P.S. the "funding abortion" as the person above me mentioned isn't quite the whole story.

Right now China owns us.

I think it was right to give her a prison sentence, to be honest, as a child has died at her hands. She does have to live with that for the rest of her life, of course, and she was obviously very depressed when she did it.  But I do wonder if she should have even had a child, given that she had a history of mental health issues.  What a very sad case-RIP little Jack.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	i don't know about the sentence but i think the solution lies in support. Every young Mum today, needs her family to surround her with love & support & understanding. This was the norm for generations before us. Most of our Mums and GrandMums went to their Mum's house for the delivery where they could be pampered & taken care of. i used to think it was a nice Indian tradition. Now, i think our ancestors were wise. They knew about PND even before it had a name. New Mums need support. Today, its all about me, mine & myself.

I sincerely believe the woman is deranged, and there is also part of me that believes we simply cannot let her go unpunished for the murder of a child.<br>  <br>  That's a long time for a baby to suffer before it dies, and all at the hands of his mother.<br>  <br>  I have had PND and been in that zombie like trance, where I am unsure what will happen if my baby does not stop crying, but I was fortunate enough to be in the house, and able to put him in his nursery and walk downstairs, knowing he is safe and my first action was to ring the doctor, and get help.<br>  <br>  That being said, I cannot know the circumstances of this woman's illness, and though I don't want any baby's death to go unpunished, I cannot help but feel that this woman needs a mental health institution rather than a prison.  For both their sakes, I sadly hope she does not and it not allowed to have another child.

Ut2MoCNLaa	"Kat T", "NooNoo" and "RichB" have all given good answers.<br>  <br>  In the past teenage girls would either marry quickly after finding out they were pregnant, would have an illegal abortion or sent away for a few months and their babies adopted. It certainly was not the "done thing" for a single female, especially a young woman.<br>  <br>  You must remember that in the US only 50 years ago girls were marrying at 13 legally and then having babies. In the UK girls were legally marrying at 14 and upwards about 100 years ago and then having babies. In Australia females as young as 13 were legally marrying about 120 years ago (I am doing my family tree and I have found many instances of 12-15 year old females marrying, but very few illegitimate children). BUT, back then in both countries the girls were reaching puberty about two-three later than they are today (better food, healthcare, more wealth and other factors nowadays).<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  GJKiss has also given an excellent answer.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I put it down to that cold spell we had.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Statistically, no they're not on the rise.

If he were my grandpa, I'd help him out.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	that is sad at his time of life|`|xIowgWL7aa	If someone offered you an investment that had a return that seemed to be too good to be true, would you buy into it? I would hope that the sane individual would step back and wonder how can the return be so big compared to what other investments are paying, but alas, to many people are too greedy and when they are told they can get a huge return, they go with it.<br>  <br>  Just because the man is 90 does not mean that he is necessarily smart. He might have looked smart and savvy about money when he made his initial investments, but he made the wrong choices. It is sad that he can't enjoy his retirement, but greed won out in this instance.|`|DIA8RRe2aa	I read it too. Its horibble!!!! He has bills and he's worked his whole life to retire and know that SOB took everything! Its awful but at the same time Ben is an inspiration because Im not even 30, and Im sitting at my desk wishing I wasn't at work LOL... Imagine having to work at 90? Its a sad story, Madoff created alot of sad stories... I hope they throw away the key.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	awhh.<br>  that's so terrible.
7xk2N7xJaa	Will they get the money back from Madoff? Hell no. The money's gone. Most of it went to pay earlier investors - that's how a Ponzi scheme works. Madoff probably spent the rest.<br>  <br>  However, a lot of people who got screwed in this scam are big Democrat donors. I wouldn't be surprised if they got a bailout from the feds.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Actually, I heard a blurb on CNBC today which suggested that a group of the smaller victims, like this man at 700K are in line for a distribution from a $1 Billion asset pool that has been found in the mess of Madoff's web of deceit.  Sure hope the guy gets some of his funds back.  The gentleman should be hired to do an advertisement for a product.

d9PdhBvMaa	It seems to have more than its fair share of evil followers who are eager to kill in the name of their religion.

tvNkizDraa	No, and I'm not 'anti-semitic' either.  I criticize the Zionist policies of the Israeli government, but I never criticize Jewish people or the Hebrew faith.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Yes, I'm a Zionist to the extent that I believe that the State of Israel needs to exist as a safe haven for Jews around the world who are just a demagogue away from another Holocaust. <br>  <br>  I do not agree with many of the policies of the Israeli government though (especially the killing of so many innocent civilians in the recent incursion into Gaza).  <br>  <br>  Maybe if the Palestinians would negotiate in good faith instead of being pawns used by other Arab nations and Iran that want to destroy Israel and discontinued terrorist attacks against Israel, they wouldn't be so "oppressed".<br>  <br>  To be a Zionist does not mean to agree blindly with the policies of the Israeli government, nor does it mean to be extreme in their hatred or to exhibit traits of inhumanity towards the Arabs.  This is a misconception constantly attributed to us on this site.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	Yes,I am.<br>  WhyBecause Zionism is just the movement for the Jews returning to their historical motherland: Palestine.<br>  What do I think about "palestinians"?I know no other Palestinians than the native inhabitants of Palestine.And the native inhabitants of Palestine,as we know from the Bible and from the historical chronicles as ansieent as the Egyptian yyramides.were the Jews and Israelis.<br>  The arabs who are now crying they are "the palestinians" are in my opinion just a bunch of cheap impostors who have the same right to call themselves "palestinians" as I have the right to call myself Chingachgook The Big Serpent,the last of the Mohicans|`|H3zTS7khaa	Otto, there is no answer you will hear except the one you want.I know you know what that is.|`|wdyf1sueaa	I'm Lebanese and I'm a Zionist, do you even know what a Zionist is ??<br>  <br>  Islamic terror has to do with what Koran says not with what Israelis do.<br>  <br>  Islam will not be satisfied until all of us none Muslims are gone, It is that simple. This religion requires that we be gone and that this religion dominate the earth. As long as the major religious leaders of Islam refuse to combat this idea, and even encourage it, there will be terrorism, that's why they blow up..|`|kKswtGMwaa	I am pro-Israel. The muslims blowing Israelis up get paid for it, their families get blood money and they think they will become martyrs.<br>  israelis have a right to live in peace but it is not seen that way by muslims in the middle east or anywhere else in the world. Muslims support muslims no matter how appalling their actions are.<br>  And it is an old feeble excuse saying it is because they are oppressed. Those in Britain have been given a free ride, they live on benefits and have houses, education and medical care, but still it is not enough. Their mindset is incompatible with the western way of life and it is a pity that the governments of Europe were slow to realise it.<br>  The terrorists make videos and say they kill for Islam, are they lying or are you trying to pretend it is the fault of the west. Islam does not seem to be compatible with modern life and it was wrong to allow immigration from the stone age to the modern world.|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	mir miron; did you watch how the israeli channel 10, insults and makes fun of Jesus & Mary afew days ago???|`|6rcRZUnSaa	I'm  Jewish,  but  I'm  not  zionist, because  real  zionist  live  in  Israel.<br>  Definition  of  Zionist  and  Zionism;  <br>  Zionist  is  the   person  who  wants  to  live  on  the  land  for  all  Jews  in  the  world - Israel. Zionism is  ideology  that  support  idea  of  returning  to  homeland  for the Jewish People and  built  new  country  for  them. Many  people  think  that  zionism  is  some  kind  of  fascism, but  when  you  are  not  welcome  in  countries  were  you, your  father  and  many  of  your  died  relatives  had  lived  for  centuries. You  treat  like  a  second  class  citizen,  and  all  people  hate  you  just  because  you  are  Jew. <br>  You  understand  that  something  should  be  change. This  idea  had  many  people  and  they  wanted  that  Jews  lived  in  their  homeland  country, feel  that  they  are   safe  and  others  Jews  who  lived  around  the  world  were  proud  of  fact  that  they  have  real  motherland. This  idea  became  real  after  WW2, when  a  lot  of  Jews  were  killed  by  Nazis, and  leaders  of  western  countries  gave  them  a  small  piece  of  land  that  was  Jewish  land  two  thousand  years  ago. The  reason  why  they  did  that  was  that  they  did  nothing  to  stop  Hitler  before  he  started  the  war.<br>  Jews  got  their  land  without  west  West Bank, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, but  The following da of  Israel  independent y five Arab countries–invaded Israel, launching the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Arabs  never  wanted  Jewish  state, and  they  did  and  do  what  they  any  things  to  destroy  Jew  state. I  had  opportunity  to  live  in  Israel, but  I  don't  want  to  die  from  some  terrorist  pots  who  wanted  freedom  from  Jews, but  like  a  lot  others  freedom  fighters  around  the  world  don't  know  what  to  do  with  this  freedom. For  example, I  can  remember  freedom  fighters  from  Alger  who  fought  for  freedom  and  won, but  now  a lot  people  from  that  country  increased  population  in  France  by  many  times. Why  did   they  fight  for  freedom  and  than  go  to  country  that  occupied  them  for  more  than  one  hundred  years?<br>  Do  you  think  something  the  same  will  be  with  Palestine? If  you  ask  this  question  to  me, my  answer  is  yes.   <br>  <br>  P.S. I  have  pro-Israel  position.|`|GOifC7i3aa	i am not jewish or a zionist<br>  <br>  but i do support israel's right to protect itself from islamic terrorists<br>  <br>  israel has been subjected to attacks from terrorists funded by syria and iran for years, and also had to fight all out wars with its muslim neighbours<br>  <br>  it has learned that there is much hatred in this region for non-muslims and has had to be tough to surivive<br>  <br>  if israel had soft politicians like those in europe it would no longer exist|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I'm not sure how old you are, but I remember growing up in the 70s and 80s. There were news reports usually every month or so about a bomb exploding on an Israeli bus, or school, or market or anywhere innocent civilians would be. Men women and children were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. This did happen. I remember seeing all the news reports with ambulances and paramedics carrying bloody children. Liberals never seem to remember this for some reason. Finally Israel got tired of these attacks so they put up security fences. The fences worked. You don't hear about many attacks inside Israel any more. But everyone now says Israel is the monster for putting up the fences. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 in hopes of Peace. Palestinians moved in and started shooting across the border at Israeli farmers. Israel responded and the world said "oh look.. Israel broke the ceasefire!. Hamas spent the next few years shooting rockets into Israel. Israel didn't respond for years. Then they warned Hamas to stop or else they would attack. Hamas wouldn't stop so Israel attacked. And once again the world says Israel is the monster. <br>  I'm not a zionist, but I do believe that Israel has a right to protect herself.<br>  <br>  How do explain Islamic terror in other parts of the world? <br>  India<br>  Sudan<br>  Algeria<br>  Pakistan<br>  Indonesia<br>  Nigeria<br>  Thailand<br>  Spain<br>  Turkey <br>  Morocco <br>  Kosovo<br>  Bosnia<br>  Kenya<br>  Somalia<br>  the Philippines<br>  All of these places and more have had problems with Islamic terrorists. Are you really saying this is ALL about Israel? And how is the west raping all of these places? I think Islamic extreemists are fighting for domination in these places.

But this was no ordinary pet.  This was a wild animal that is particularly strong and particularly aggressive.  Animals like chimpanzees should not have the opportunity to become part of the family, because they should not be kept as pets-it's cruel and dangerous.|`|vZMN82U8aa	its like having kids, some parents beat them, others spoil em to death... <br>  <br>  <br>  pets become as strong a part of the family as kids, esp when youve had the dogs 17 years (lurchers) <br>  <br>  weve lost all 4 over the last 18 months, mainly due to old age and ill health... when Holly went, two weeks ago, my wife was beside herself, and quite upset... its passing slowly... but i see teh tears in her eyes...|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I have loved and lost so many wonderful pets and didn't know if I could get past the grief.<br>  <br>  There are domestic pets...dogs, cats, etc. but a wild animal will always be a wild animal no matter what. This woman, when she lost her husband, should have made new friends, worked in a pet store or volunteered at the zoo. Owning an exotic pet is risky. Look at the snakes who have wrapped themselves around a helpless child. Leave them in the wild or visit them at the zoo. A bit safer I'm thinking.|`|822a369b8f320e09663fcafb542917aeaa	Oh definitely!  This is weird, and ended up with the chimp being shot which is a shame.<br>  <br>  Did you see Russel Brand's Pet Ponderland?

Not kept in the dark like a 5 year old child|`|exwBUM2oaa	Of course he's going to say that. Who do you think is paying for the stimulus? Most of it is American tax dollars.|`|7xk2N7xJaa	The issue is not so much that he's speaking bleakly about the economy, but that his campaign made the very strong (though implicit) suggestion that putting him in office would fix everything. Now Obama's in the White House and he knows he can't live up to the hype. He thus has to lower expectations.<br>  <br>  I agree that he shouldn't 'talk down' the economy and I also agree that he shouldn't necessarily cheerlead either. What he should be doing is...well, both. The presidency carries considerable inspirational and symbolic strength, and he should use that. He should be saying, yes, it's bad, but we've seen far worse and come through. This is America, it's the greatest country in the world, and it's great because of the continual optimism and industriousness and drive of the American people. This was the theme Reagan used and it worked wonders.<br>  <br>  He campaigned on inspirational speeches - if that is his strength then he should work with it.<br>  <br>  Of course that is assuming he -wants- the economy to improve. The longer it stays in the shitter, the more people he can render dependent on government assistance, and convince them that government is the only thing that can be trusted to keep things going.<br>  <br>  Additional edit for the fellow below me:<br>  American support for Israel is about $2 billion a year in loan guarantees - not all of which are converted into actual loans. Most of that is probably recovered via arms sales. The projected federal deficit this year is over a trillion dollars. Where, pray tell, do you propose to get the other $998 billion?

That's because they are relying on press releases, rather than doing some real investigating of the story and reporting the facts.<br>  One clear example is the "mortgage meltdown". Right now, 91% of home mortgages are up to date and current. In short, less than ten percent are having trouble meeting their mortgage payments or have gone into foreclosure.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	The stock market is based on the confidence or the lack thereof pertaining to the economy.  When the media portrays a pessimistic outlook, the stock market goes down.  If they would take a positive attitude, the market would go up.  Simple isn't it.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	I think the economy is truly bad, but it is not as bad as the media is making it.

My friends parents went with their kids and even told me because they got third row seats. She had to have a fake chinese person to come in during her concert so she could change clothes. I mean the Jonas Brothers could have done another song, but noo. She had to have someone else fill her place and disappoint thousands of fans.|`|OYcB4rvraa	becuase she has no values. She takes bad pictures and i understand that all teens do but when she works with disney and is a role modle she should be more careful. And also she didnt HAVE to do that photo shoot she cose to and taht was her mistake. Also she is rasictys i saw the picture of her on a tv show so i know it wasnt photo shoopped. I like hannah monatanna though!|`|r8ST3cFIaa	Don't get me wrong or anything, I don't hate her, but she didn't HAVE to do that photoshoot. She could have said no at any time. Also, role models don't take pictures in the shower with a white tee shirt on when their 15.|`|XzjNsij2aa	Because she's not actually talented, and only has a record deal because her daddy had one known song, and disney spammed her music at 7 year old girls.|`|auLIuEA3aa	Everyone is out to get her because she is young and vulnerable!|`|POJNnWhDaa	I hardly even know who she is! I don't hate her. Some teenybopper bubblegum singer, right? hmmm... maybe I do hate her..|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Are you her publicist or something?|`|hdoOcMFNaa	whats the point of asking this question if you dont even care about y people hate her|`|SMVsmzi4aa	i could care less|`|Dug6yDOLaa	i'm with you, not all of that was her fault. she is just a teen who is a teensy bit rebellious compared to others. i mean it must get stressful have everything in the world anybody dreams of, she needs to let loose, and if that is her way of doing it, it is. if anyone else teen wise did it, they would be told "just don't do it again sweety" but everyone is all over miley like " OMG! SHE IS SUCH A (WHATEVER)! SHE IS ...." they trash her! it is crap, she is just a kid, give up the crap....geez that is how i get, and i see you get that way too, lol!|`|g9TxgMlwaa	I don't think she's a **** or a wh ore. The photo shoot, sweetheart she had a choice. She could have said no.  Her FATHER could have said no since she is a minor. Personally I could care less about the photo shoot. It wasn't that BIG a deal. Personally I don't like her attitude. I don't like a lot of celebrities attitudes. She's no exception.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	she doesn't suck they just want to be her and they are jealous|`|t8IXYOLCaa	she is suppose to be a GOOD role model for kids and taking pictures of herself showing her bra and her in the shower and all that is not being a good rolemodel for kids out there<br>  <br>  being so popular comes with a price when u are so popular some ppl are going to look up to you and with that said its kind of no brainer to say that she isnt like everyone else i think if she really cared about all her little fans then she would try harder to be a good rolemodel and step it up|`|DudwxNOyaa	ok that is the dumbest argument ever. No she didn't HAVE to do that photo shoot. and no she isn't a normal teen. She wanted to do that photo shoot, and do you wanna know why she got so much cr*ap for it? because she is a DISNEY STAR! most of the kids who look up to her aren't running around showing their bras or their whole backsides. and did you forget that she is dating like a 21 year old?? and how old is she? 16? ya that's not skanky at all.... honestly, she's a dumb girl and she's having her fame now, but she's a child star and that's all she ever will be. Miley is so dumb. she makes fun of other people cuz she's getting too big of a head. and ya people photoshop those photos but not all of them are. you can tell which ones are edited and which ones arent. she's not that awesome and what pisses people off the most is that she thinks she is. Ya!! she's so great cuz she knows how to impress 5 year olds!!! yay!!!! puh-leeeez!|`|umEgRb7Vaa	First, she was posting pictures of herself on the web long before that photoshoot. Second, she has almost no talent and has made her co-stars who do have some talent take a backseat to her. Third, all she cares about is an opportunity to make a buck off of the naive kids like you who idolize her. Fourth, she is a liar, pretending to be something she isn't everytime she gets found out.|`|borw2oKCaa	Its hard to know what to believe. No matter what, even if its from the source, the story could be lies or truth. Honestly it doesn't matter to me. People should worry about themselves, though you are absolutely correct in saying that they shouldnt believe everything they hear.<br>  <br>  Way to make a stand! :]|`|p5cYEPASaa	She's a *****, she posed in that pic with no clothes (only a sheet) she says she's trying to act like an adult, then goes around spreading rumours like she's a middle schooler. She didn't have to do the photo shoot, she could've refused.|`|DwsHXG30aa	BECAUSE SHE IS TALENTLESS... its as simple as that.<br>  <br>  <br>  (and the photo shoot in question was a beautiful shoot... the photographer was amazing. it baffles me why there was any controversy surrounding it)|`|9haTWuHsaa	...because she's a bimbo with an accent! lol. i like how she acts though. but i do agree with youl she needs to suck it up; becoming famous comes with a price of being liked and not being liked. she'lll be ok.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	I hate her because everyone loves her so much.<br>  shes like one of them stuck up bitches that everyone actually hates.<br>  but little girls.. look up to her.. like shes their role model.<br>  Get the picture?|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	She's supposed to be a role model, and she taking lame pictures of herself in a shower.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	Her music is for preteens, and children, so why would some one hate her for that.|`|JqQkp3MPaa	i hate her because she has a gross raspy voice and too much fame for sounding like ****.|`|33b38e0c274c2b01c553cca2f9c3b554aa	Simple, she is a whore.|`|XI74yGYUaa	something tells me this isn't a question.<br>  your'e just defending Miley.<br>  "She is a normal teen too."<br>  she's NOT. she's supposed to be a role model for all her fans. For the kids that watch disney channel, they look up to the people they see on their shows, and try to be exactly like them,<br>  <br>  i don't like her because she doesn't think of her little 7 year old fans that want to be exactly like her.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. she sucks at singing.|`|6JXXwckjaa	she dated nick(jealous)<br>  she got a bunch of fame and she can't even sing<br>  her regular voice is annoying<br>  she thinks she's a rock star<br>  <br>  I like her songs(miley not hannah)|`|KJ2W9SH0aa	i love miley as hannah;]<br>  not really miley;]|`|7L0AElC6aa	because she is weired
IIa4efh5aa	The article is the product of shoddy research and bad writing working together in order to support a preconceived idea.<br>  <br>  For openers, "Chicago" was written by a man named Fred Fisher in 1922. Sinatra would have been 5 years old at the time. The Hoboken, NJ,native didn't record "Chicago" until 1957 -- 20 years after Billy Sunday went on to his heavenly reward.<br>   <br>  It's really a stretch to conclude that the line about Chicago being aa town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down as being a slur against the evangelist. An individual could just as easily read it as a commentary on the Windy City's relaxed morals:: "See, one of the top evangelists in the country, and he couldn't.t alter public attitudes."<br>  <br>  A few words about slander. first, it must be established that the statement is false and was made with malicious intent. Secondly, dead people can't be slandered.<br>  <br>  And there is ample evidence to illustrate the lyric's truth. In 1933, Chicago was home to numerous speakeasies and notorious criminals. By 1957, the city's history included the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre and the launch of Hugh Hefner's Playboy empire.<br>  <br>  Speaking of Playboy, an interview the magazine conducted with sinatra in 1963leaves the idea that the singer did indeed enjoy a relationship with the Creator:<br>  <br>  I`m for anything that gets you through the night, be it prayer, tranquilizers or a bottle of Jack Daniels. But to me religion is a deeply personal thing in which man and God go it alone together, without the witch doctor in the middle.<br>  <br>  No "witch doctor' or priest/mediator needed for Christians. This was one of Billy Sunday's themes.<br>  <br>  <br>  .

IIa4efh5aa	Nazi Germany did not have a free news media, and individuals who were believed to oppose Hitler had a habit of disappearing or dying.
br1kwegaaa	Time Magazine had an article on his reporting in Central America in the '40 and '50s.  It does include his involvement in Guatemala in 1954.
