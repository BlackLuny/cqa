20090220220120AALMiTp	Local Businesses;United States;Miami	I'm stuck in a rut in Miami, Fl?	Here's the deal. I am 17 years old, I have over a year of restaurant management experience, I am in college now for Network Engineering(two months shy of my A+ cert. then two and a half years to go), I've got my GED, reliable transportation, and endless availability...But now I have no job! Everywhere I have applied tells me that I must be at least 18. I am only a few months shy of being 18 but I cannot wait as I live on my own and have bills to pay. The reason I don't have a job anymore is because I was recently in a car accident and for a short period of time I did not have a way into work. I had to call out a few times and the restaurant that I was a supervisor at decided to cut me...(only days before I got a new car, sucks!)       Does anyone know of anywhere in south florida, specifically Miami area, that would hire someone like me?
