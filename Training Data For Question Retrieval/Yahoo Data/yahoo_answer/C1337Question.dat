20090205191802AAx2Evs	Social Science;Psychology	I get angry all the time.  Is this normal?	I am very easily angered by several things.  For example, if someone does something that I feel is "disrespecting" me, I get extremely pissed off, even if I know that that isn't what they're trying to do.  Most of the time, I just want to walk up and punch them in the face, put I've learned to somewhat control my anger because of an "incident" a while back.    Another thing that really sets someone off is if I feel someone is uneducated or ignorant.  It's even worse if I feel someone is ignorant, and I try to explain to them what is wrong with their opinion/plan/idea, and they won't listen.      Is it normal to get this upset at these things?

20090205170703AA3FQC4	Social Science;Psychology	Are you introvert..extrovert or ambivert?	introvert- is a person who is energized by being alone and whose energy is drained by being around other people. Introverts are more concerned with the inner world of the mind. They enjoy thinking, exploring their thoughts and feelings.      extrovert is a person who is energized by being around other people. Extroverts tend to "fade" when alone and can easily become bored without other people around. When given the chance, an extrovert will talk with someone else rather than sit alone and think.      ambivert is like a mixture of introvert and extrovert.  An ambivert is normally comfortable with groups and enjoys social interaction, but also relishes time alone and away from the crowd.

But, I also find men physically attractive, but I can never put forth the effort to be in any type of relationship with one beyond friends.

I've never been in a relationship or on a "real" date with a man or woman. I have, however, been out with guys, but I felt so bored and uninterested.      I just don't know what to think or do?      Can someone give me some answers?

20090205195535AAer2Rw	Social Science;Psychology	How do you overcome a childhood of being made fun of for being the fat, dirty kid?	Basically as a kid I was poor, dirty, and obese.  I was 200 lbs by the time i was 12 years old and hit my highest weight of 252 lbs when I was 16 years old.  Now Im 20 and weight 219.    Also, growing up my family was very poor and kind of gross.   My mom was an alcoholic for a while and we had no money.  When I was 10 years old my parents were arrested and charged with child neglect.    Ive always been made fun of, and ignored which is even worse, for all of these things.  I never really had friends in school and i still tend to feel very shy and inferior.   Its hard for me to feel like people actually like me and that they would want me in their life.  I always just feel like either a burden or too much of a loser for anyone to want me.    Is it possible to overcome these feelings?

20090205194205AAIiN6S	Social Science;Psychology	This is an important question about life?	Ok, heh well this is a question that applies to everyone so all should answer. Not to bore you but quickly this is my situation thus far and I can't believe I have done this to myself!      For the past years, I haven't had my own independence because I follow my sister around practically everywhere. And because of that, I do what she likes (things I find really boring) everyday.   Following her has been like hell, because I feel like I never get to do what I want and I get so angry cause of that. And all this time of wishing I were somewhere else, I have thought up some huge dreams for myself. Yet, I remain a quiet, shy person on the outside. But on the inside, I am funny, brutally honest, and I like to talk. I can't believe what an act I even been putting on. Here's the part I want you guys to respond to: By hanging out with all of my sister's friends who shared "conservative" beliefs while I have very liberal beliefs, I feel like I want to get away and in my life, finally enjoy what I want to do. But, I feel embarrassed if they ever found out because how they see me is totally different from what I think. But should I be embarrassed? It hurts me inside when they degrade stuff I like and talk about it so badly, yet I love that stuff but don't keep quiet! (Random example, I love fashion and being fit, yet they say it like it is so retarded to like that kind of stuff.)   Can life do a total 360 and should I be embarrassed of what people think?

And at the end of the class, before the bell rang, she would see how much you worked, got done, how you worked, ect. And if she didn't like it, she would shoot you/kill you. I made it, luckily, but some of my classmates ahead of my in line, did not. The dream repeated, alot. But the last time it happened, i did the exact things I have done in the other times, but this time, she put the gun to right under my jaw, on my neck, and shot me. Once, then paused, then two more quickly. One after another. Then I jolted awake as I fell to the ground in death and my friends were screaming. --  I could hear them distantly because I was dying, then, as i said before, I jolted awake, breathing heavily.      It was...scary. and my heart was pounding. What does this mean? I'm clueless....

Long story short:      I showed interest in a guy I had never met, and he responded very well talking to people telling them he was interested, making sure he was everywhere I was. Then we started talking on the phone, and set up plans to hang out for the first time. He completely blew me off, and he never spoke to me again.      How do I get over this guy? It's been a month since this happened, and he hasn't tried to talk to me or fix anything. I see him all the time at school.

20090205195114AAOcXUw	Social Science;Sociology	I believe my job is becoming a victim of this "economic downfall." What should I do?	First off, I'm a 2nd assistant manager at F.Y.E. (for your entertainment). Less then a week ago we had gotten and e-mail from our home office CEO letting us know that in the past 6 months things have been pretty crappy. We were informed that due to this economic crisis there will be no pay raises during the whole year of 2009 and no 401k for those getting it. I wasn't too concerned by the situation because the pay is **** there anyway and I have to stick it out because I'm just not getting calls for interviews elsewhere. Also, I was not concerned because come June the senior assistant is moving out of state and for the past 3 months both my store manager and the sr. assistant have been telling me they are going to slowly teach me things related to taking on the sr. assistant job. Well, today my boss brought up that he wanted me to sit in for an upcoming interview or two just to see how the process is done. Now, at this point I'm assuming this is due to an observation they want me to participate in so I can see how the job is done. BUT... my manager at one point or another was rambling on about some senseless things about the store and one line that caught me was "... so we can find someone to take TJ's place" who is the sr assistant. Now I'm thinking to myself WTF... am I or am I not getting this promotion? Nothing is set in stone. So I was not worried about this "no pay raises" because in a promotion type deal, I am guaranteed to move on to hourly and obviously make a bit more. NOW I'm flipping out because I don't know whats going. Our lease is up for our store this coming October. I've already closed one with the company back in Jan. of 08 and moved to the next store. I was fortunate enough to nail a transfer to the one I am now at. But now I'm having doubts if our lease will even be renewed or the store relocated because we are actually losing money at that store. Huge store and not enough sales. Our rent is way too high. Our company is shrinking. They let 25 people go at the home office and another 700 and some through out. So obviously there is something here to maybe be worried about but at this point I'm just not sure what to think/do?

20090205210517AAlvpGj	Social Science;Sociology	Multiculturalism Within America?	Multiculturalism Within America   After doing some reading and study about the multiculturalism within present-day America, I have a few thoughts I would like to share.   As members of our diverse American society, we must all acknowledge and accept the reality that the race/ethnic composition and diversity within the United States is undergoing great change, through the concept of multiculturalism- a belief that society is combined of differing cultures and groups that end up retaining some favored customs and traditions, along with the ability of co-existence between the groups.   Our present society within the United States is very different regarding the racial and ethnic makeup of members compared to the members of our society fifty years ago.   Yes, the residing society within the United States has always maintained a high degree of diversity throughout American history, with the majority of the population being white, who have been dominant in positions of power and authority. That fact is drastically changing now.   Presently, considerable change is clearly evident in the racial and ethnic makeup of America.   Within the United States, one out of four individuals now identifies themselves as Hispanic, along with a staggering number identifying themselves as belonging to two or more races.   It is also predicted by the mid-twenty -first century, the "average" American will be an individual of color.   Although I find these facts shocking, I am accepting of this multi-cultural emerging whirlwind we now all face.   The concept of multiculturalism will most definitely not be accepted by all. These individuals will feel that the traditional American values they have grown with will be devalued and undermined and will distort their traditions.   We all have to be as accepting to this fact as we can-for the good and the benefit of our country.   Take care
20090203072532AAHQCMH	Social Science;Psychology	Explanation of an abuse victim's mentality?	Hello there. So, I am writing a book -- a sequel to my first one, actually -- in which one of my main characters finds herself in an abusive relationship. I've done what research I can about what makes and abuser tick and what warning signs of a bad relationship are, but I was hoping someone could explain exactly what goes through an abuse victim's mind.       As it stands, my character feels (and, really, is) trapped in her relationship. She honestly doesn't have much choice about leaving this guy -- she even tries a couple times and her uncle continually brings her back.       How would she be coping with that, do you think? How would she keep going about day-to-day life? How would she cope with the fact that she knows she will probably be forced into marrying this guy?      Any insight into the mind of an abuse victim would be very, very helpful.

20090203065551AAfnUzM	Social Science;Psychology	How do you cope with putting your dreams on hold?	For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of having a smallholding farm. Nothing big, nothing commercial. The idea of being surrounded by wilderness, or at the outskirts of a small community, is appealing to me. I dream of waking up to the birds, the smell of fresh air, the sounds of various creatures - children included.       I'm lucky to say my husband agrees with me, however he's the provider in our family, and since we're about to have our first child and we've had to use our savings to get us by due to this recession cutting his sales, it could be years before I ever get out of this gray city.      I hope one day I can teach my children that carrots have plant parts, beans grow on vines, and apples grow on trees.       It's clear to me now, especially because my husband is seeking more schooling, that this won't happen for my first child, not till he's long grown in this cement jungle.      In case you might of guessed it, I'm not a city person. I find it all too taxing and congested. We all have our places in life, and this isn't mine.      I appreciate my husband's efforts, I know he's doing everything he can to provide and protect us. And yet, I can't help but feel a deep loss when I learn the reality of our situation.       How do I maintain motivation and satisfaction knowing that day might never come?

I guess i feel the way i feel cause back on these few years, some hopes i had about these girls l liked went down to drain, and ended up alone, kind of mad, confused, and disappointed about all this things going around in my life. now it's been a a year or so that i haven't kind of thrown myself into this hopes and feelings about getting together with some chick. what should i do? i need some words, something, i really feel down on my azz and messed up all in my mind, i want something good for me, but at times i guess i myself messed up good chances to be around with some good girl. please give me your views on this, advice, or somethin, anything just to stop a little bit feeling this shitty. thanx ya'll in advice.

I think my dreams are trying to tell me something now. For example, I had a friend in the past and we decided we shouldnt be friends any more. Months passed and I didn't really think about her. Then I began dreaming about her. The dreams came one day after another. They were about that she missed me and wanted to be friends with me again. So i did end up going back to this friend and talking to her, and it seems my dreams were true and we became friends again. was it just a couincidence or was it more than that? But my true question here is if I should listen to my dreams. Right now I'm dreaming about this girl in my class and I've had sort of a crush on her since my first year at this school. My dreams are telling me that she is alone and wants someone to be with. I don't know whether or not I should talk to her. No, I just don't want to talk to her because I dreamt of her but I've also been wanting to be with her. Can anyone help me out? I feel like I'm in a really weird position. Are dreams more than pictures? Should I talk this girl? I can't figure this out by myself, I need a little help. Thank you for your time.

I am 24 and am a dwarf   On good days I can wake up, put on my best shirt, look into the mirror and feel extremely good about myself in spite of the imperfections...It feels like everything is just right.      On bad days I don't like looking into the mirror. I feel like the ugliest person on the planet. I don't feel like shaving, don't feel like working..I just wish I did not have to leave home....wish I could just stay in bed till everything becomes alright again.      I wonder what the good-looking people feel like.

20090205210315AAMGjCn	Social Science;Psychology	Would this stop you from not wanting to accept an apology?	i dumped my friend for reasons i do not want to say. i find her selfish. she only thinks of her spending time with me and not other things that i need to give time to.   she had this friend. she and him were good friends. then things happened between them and they stopped being friends. after they stopped being friends, she said some mean things about the guy and said he only contacts her when he needs something and only looks at his advantage in things as a person. and she would say she just doesn't care about that guy anymore.      now, i see her and this guy ex-friend have patched up. and i heard from sources that the guy approached her to patch things up.      i recently got an apology from this girl (my ex-friend).   is she a *****? should i not accept her apology?

20090205211000AAgb6VR	Social Science;Psychology	Is this just a phase...?	I think I am starting to lose faith in the people around me. I'm not trying to sound vain but i get so tired of being surrounded by ingnorant/dumb people who insist on being just that. I don't mean the school smart or the street smart, just simply logical. I feel like I'm alone (and no i'm not going to start cutting my wrists because "nobody understands me"). It is so frustrating to see people stumble over something that is so obivous to me.Or be so blind as to not see their own flaws and think everyone likes them. Also, I think that I might even be losing faith in my "religion" even if i didn't even practice it. Consider me a future atheist now. Btw, I'm 14. I know this might be some kind of venting/ranting but it just wouldn't stop bothering me.

20060718194010AAcLQlx	Social Science;Anthropology	Para Darwin, só o mais forte sobrevive. Pergunto: Será o mal na alma humana indispensável à sobrevivência?	Darwin tambem afirmava que quando um órg?o ou fun?áo do corpo de uma criatura tem sua utilidade reduzida face a um desafio do ambiente, o organismo busca se adaptar às novas condi??es, e acaba eventualmente por reduzir-lhe ou modificar-lhe a fun??o, ao longo dos milênios em que transcorre o processo da evolu??o. Assim sendo, será que se toda a violência, o egoísmo e a maldade fossem características assim t?o desumanas, Já N?O TERIAM DESAPARECIDO DA HUMANIDADE AO LONGO DOS úLTIMOS 20.000 ANOS DE CIVILIZA??O (ultima estimativa apresentada pela Arqueologia)?   Quero crer no livre arbitrio, na racionalidade, na prevalencia do bem sobre o mal, mas a luz das evidencias do mundo moderno, onde o mal sempre parece mais forte que o bem, e a lei e a justi?a deixam os fracos desamparados, como podemos continuar a acreditar num mundo melhor, mais justo, mais fraterno, mais solidario?

20090205213524AAHTw78	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Are we really smarter than our bronze age ancestors?	often times i hear and read peoples opinions about many issues, these issues often range around the debate between creationists and the opposing factions such as atheists.      over and over i hear people say stuff like:      "we live in the modern world, we aren't stupid like people 200 years ago"      understand im paraphrasing, my point (and question) is there any real evidence to say that today people are somehow smarter than they were several hundred years ago?      evolution could not cause an increase in brain activity in such a short time (if you believe in that)      sure we drive in cars and use cell phones, but isn't that just us taking advantage of the advances of other people?

20090205212340AAliP5l	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I do this to myself?	Ok, I have a problem. I often like to study alternative things like the Law of Attraction, holistic healing etc.      The Law of Attraction, states that what we think about we attract, and lately I'm been thinking about negative things happening to me. I cannot stop, ever since I heard that it was the Law of Attraction, that determines what happens in our lives, I have been thinking very negatively.      Also, I learned about karma and such; and think bad things will happen because of my negative thinking and actions.      I'm so scared that my life will turn out bad because of my bad thoughts.       How do I stop? I'm scarred that if I stop I forget about what I was thinking, and the thing will happen once I forget.      How do I get over this? And is the Law of Attraction/karma really true? Or is it people trying to scare us into doing things such as this?
20090205212806AARtOmz	Social Science;Psychology	Is being naive believing everything someone says or is it closing your mind for security and "realism"?	I think that being truly naive is being so skeptical that you are close minded. When you close your mind, you shut off the potential opportunities you may have in life. Surely you benefit the security but you lose more than you could potentially gain. If you are open minded you can eventually claim the benefits that a close minded person would not. What would you gain closing your mind? Not being tricked. But it really depends. Most of the time you won't lose much. But having an open mind long term has better benefits. And yet you can still learn some information and you can still use common sense at situations. For example if someone you know has lied, do not listen to them if they speak of something similar as they are liars. Or if you have been fooled by a company, do not go to that company anymore. Being open minded and using your intellect will get you furthest possible instead of closing you mind and locking yourself in.

While trying to escape, we found an armored Cadillac got in it and it was a flying car, but there was no steering wheel. The only way to fly it was by computer.      My husband had a dream that he and I were pushing chairs outside and then suddenly he started floating.      My daughter had a dream that the three of us were being chased by a tornado and we all were flying away.

TENTE ENTENDER O CONTEúDO E DEPOIS RESPONDA SEM SE PREOCUPAR COM OS PONTOS      Famosa frase de Sócrates. Se o ponto de interroga??o é recente, interrogar n?o o é. Porque a perplexidade e a dúvida s?o inerentes à condi??o humana. Quem somos? De onde vimos? Para onde vamos? Qual o sentido da vida? Interroga??es às quais Kant (Immanuel Kant, 1724-1804, filósofo alem?o) agregou três quest?es fundamentais: Que posso saber? Que devo fazer? O que posso esperar? Mas Kant n?o foi o primeiro filósofo a fazer perguntas. Sócrates, que aliás n?o deixou escritos, estava convencido de que o questionamento pessoal era a melhor forma de examinar idéias de forma lógica e de determinar sua validade. Este método deu origem à dialética, o método que busca a verdade através do choque de proposi??es divergentes.
