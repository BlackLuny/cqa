Or I hate when you space out and someone things you are staring at them and then they think that you are checking them out.|`|pcHCLfZkaa	Have you ever spaced out READING?<br>  I'm serious -- I have some major ADD, lol.<br>  <br>  Seriously.<br>  It's like I'll be reading and thinking about something else.<br>  Idk!<br>  <br>  But yeah.<br>  I have.<br>  <br>  I usually listen to what people are saying, but if it's one of those drones who go on and on...Then yeah. I space out. :)|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Yeah lol. I don't do it on purpse though. Lmao.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yay Daoie! Congrats.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Congrats!<br>  <br>  Only when our meetings at work go on past lunch time! Then I'll start to zone!|`|AA12006309	Yes, all the time, but I also know I have ADD.  I tend to zone out sometimes, it's like, I see them talking, I can hear there are words coming out of their mouth, but it's like the words don't actually reach my brain. Somewhere between ear and brain they get lost.  I feel bad having to say "Sorry, can you please repeat that?"  *sigh*|`|Ao52XHjCaa	Nah, my attention span is solid except when I'm tired. Then I just don't pay much attention to I wish it were morning and April. I hope spring comes soon. Baseball starts in the Spring. How bout those Twins! I wish I had a twin. Always did. What were we talking about again?<br>  <br>  Oh yeah. Congrats on the SOM award.|`|793OI1W6aa	I try not to, cos then they'll ask me questions about what they're saying, and I'll say "yeah" and then they'll say "no, what did you say you're studying". "oh! sorry".<br>  <br>  Congrats on your award!|`|d0WaYTeGaa	LMAO. Sounds that way. My boyfriend often gets mad at me because I can't listen to him and watch T.V. at the same time.|`|aYqCb3olaa	all the time if I notice something else.

I can't even help it, if what they're saying doesn't interest me I start talking about something else LOL
52cdjmbQaa	It says you have to love Christ, which would make you a christian. <br>  <br>  "Love me or go to hell". Sounds reasonable.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	John 1:12<br>  But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name. <br>  Romans 10:13  <br>  For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	well thats what christians seem to believe. <br>  ooooooooooh! jesus jesus i love jesus pls save all those souls. ill pray for them too my lord ill pray.<br>  riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... oook.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	it may make the claim but how you think of it is up to you.<br>  there are many general implied statements through all of literature that require some realization . so we have idioms figures of speech statements that miss the target but all are useful if interpreted properly. I thought everybody was wise to the limits of truth in advertising these days .|`|GEfUTyi8aa	So if a book told you to jump off a bridge and you will be saved would you do it?   Like the crazy muslims who attach bombs to their bodies thinking they will have 72 virgins in the next life...... they think their god and bible is correct.<br>  <br>  Dont believe a book of stories written by men..... all think they are correct.... just try to be a good person and live your life... and your boss has no business telling you these things at work.... <br>  <br>  I am not an atheist.... but if I had to choose whom to listen to... most atheists have a better grasp on reality.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	John 14:6 'Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"<br>  <br>  I think that's what he was referring to..|`|jwKOANhpaa	It says that whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire!!!! Muahhaahaahaa!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	If you aren't a christian, then you shouldnt have to worry about that then.  Believe what you want.  It does probably say that in the bible, cus christianity does sometimes use fear to make you believe in it, such as hell.  I believe that the possibilities are endless.  Your matter may turn into some other life form millions of years later, after you die.  Or something weird may happen in the universe, and cause life somewhere else, theres so many things that can happen.|`|a4crNiGdaa	that is so not true<br>  only nonbelievers or people that are bad go to hell<br>  because they don't believe in God<br>  or were mean to people and killed people too<br>  even people who kill them self go to hell<br>  but just because they arent christians doesnt mean they will go to hell<br>  im not a christian but i believe in God and i dont pray to jesus <br>  i only pray to God, but of course  i believe in jesus<br>  ok<br>  done<br>                     *=))|`|Io9288c7aa	Only those who believe In Jesus as the Christ will Go to Heaven.   A christian is anyone who follows Christ to the best of their ability. Which is what one would naturally, even automatically, do if they loved Jesus. Thus any one who loves Jesus as the Christ, is a Christian, whether they know it or Not. It is not necessary to belong to a Church to be officially a Christian. Anyone and every one who believes in, loves and  follows Christ's teachings, are in fact a follower of Christ, which is all that the word Christian really means.|`|jKph4peTaa	someone above me said all you need is faith, they left the part out where it says you have to have faith in God and believe that Jesus died for our sins and pray for forgiveness. that's pretty much what the bible says you have to do to go to heaven.|`|yN1gO4xaaa	It doesn't matter. The bible is incorrect. There is no God.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Faith is all that is needed|`|U7kJPlciaa	ya it does....i would normally give a really long answer and give you every detail but im tired lol....but yes if you are not saved, then you go to Hell....|`|01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	Well the only way to heaven is through the son (Jesus), so if you accept Jesus into your life you're 'Christian.' <br>  <br>  "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23). <br>  <br>  I cannot say anything of anybody's fate and do not know their future, but I do know that only through Jesus can you go to heaven.<br>  <br>  Here's another verse:<br>  <br>   John 14:6, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." -this basically says it: that the only way to heaven is through Jesus<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|fgMVnV8Daa	NO it does not.<br>  It does give guidelines and tells you what you need to do to go to heaven. Acts 2:38 is a major verse.|`|7gVtQsOMaa	i would say he is ill informed, i think if u r a good person u get to heaven, i dont believe in god, but if i did then i would just be a good person|`|oEfa2myTaa	Awww you beleve fiction? Thats cute! If God loves us sooo much why send us to hell at all, I mean would you send your child to hell for eternaty? Something dosen't add up here.|`|41U6UBu5aa	Nobody is going to hell. Or heaven for that matter.|`|O5IzJLQPaa	he obviously hasnt achieve his full morality.|`|KhUhmY2gaa	Actually the bible says all you need is faith.|`|AA10657034	well... yahh... btw... the bible is complete nonsense.|`|TbZeLX6laa	You MUST believe in Jesus alone to save you, to get into heaven. <br>  <br>  Only Jesus saves.  Only Jesus paid for our sins. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)
f0JLp4hFaa	"In some respects, science has far surpassed religion in delivering awe. How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant. God must be even greater than we dreamed!”? Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way."  -- Carl Sagan<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A literal reading of the Bible tells us that God conjured the world out of nothing, then conjured man out of mud, and conjured woman out of a man's rib.  Nothing in the story was beyond the understanding of even the most humble people over 2000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Science tells us that the universe came into existence through a cataclysm of immeasurable power, so strong that the heat from the event still warms the universe 13.5 billion years later.  Science tells us of stellar birth and death, events so powerful they could strip the atmosphere off a planet from 1000 light years away.  Science tells us of minerals created in the vast atomic forges in the center of giant stars.  Science tells us of a massive, glorious dance of the heavens over billions of years, and of the creation of our precious planet among trillions of other stars and planets.  Science tells us of an incredibly simple, elegant process of gradual change driven by the imperative to survive, leading to stunningly varied, adaptable, resilient life - life so vibrant and sweeping that it changed the very nature and composition of our planet.<br>  <br>  The creation story of the Bible takes a few short verses, and hasn't changed in 2000 years.  The creation story of science consumes entire libraries, is supported by warehouses of samples and evidence, and is growing every day.  The creation story of science challenges the comprehension of even modern, educated man, and science freely admits the story is not yet complete or fully understood.  <br>  <br>  If you are a Biblical literalist, you are limiting your god to a few 2000-year-old campfire stories.  Let science into your faith, view science as the quest to better understand your god, and embrace and learn science rather than denying it.  Treat the Bible as a moral lesson, as an allegory, not as a textbook.   Look at the glories beyond the Bible, and then you can truly appreciate what your god has done.|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	Creationism is a pseudoscience based on preconceived notions. You cannot conduct 'science' with an agenda in mind. I cannot go out and say I'm going to objectively prove that creation is a fact. Creationists have yet to present anything even remotely resembling facts to bolster their assumptions. Instead they focus their time on pointing out the flaws of evolution with a logical fallacy called the either/or principle. If evolution is wrong then it follows that creationism must be right. No. If one is wrong, the other still needs to present compelling evidence to prove they are right. Creationists still need to do this.<br>  <br>  Should they be combined? No.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Yes!<br>  You are God's creation ,and God created you to evolve from a "worthless sinner" into a "forgiven child of God".<br>  <br>  There!... <br>  You have your Evolution and Creationism working in unison!<br>  If you don't find yourself evolving into a child of God, then that proves evolution is a dud.<br>  But if you find your Creator (God) ,creating a stir in your heart, then that proves that "Creationism" is the real deal.|`|6El0zpBJaa	Creationism alone.<br>  <br>  It takes more faith to believe in evolution than to believe in Creation.<br>  <br>  Have any of you seen the movie, EXPELLED?<br>  <br>  That movie is a perfect example of how creation scientists (and there are many) and those who believe in intelligent design, are black balled and silenced when they speak out.<br>  <br>  Darwinism continues to be disproved, as well as leaving many questions unanswered (such as how did life begin).<br>  <br>  When you see a snowman in a yard, do you ever wonder if it came about by chance?<br>  How can you possibly believe that the amazing human body came about by chance?<br>  <br>  God is the Creator of the Heavens, Earth,.... and Life!|`|gYJ7COAIaa	this is a little off subject but in science the universe was created by the big bang which was basically an explosion came out of no where and created the universe and in religion god from nowhere created the universe so to some extent religion and science is the same thing...<br>  <br>  but all in all I believe both happened  but I believe humans were created by god and the animals were formed from evolution because there is too much that sets us aside from animals to say we came from nowhere.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	Neither have much to do with the price of eggs in china. combine them or choose one over the other it still doesn't amount to a hill of beans unless of you have to know the reason some people work in genetics and then it's only how it came about not the goal or usefullness.|`|z60A96sIaa	Hi, oldschoollefty1:<br>  <br>  No, they can not be combined because the Bible speaks of Adam's sin and fall, thus the need to redeem us through Christ's substitutional death.<br>  <br>  Did you know that Satan considers those who teach his invention of evolution as his special ministers?

For reasons unknown one planet had a little warm pond. The little warm pond just happened to have all the components necessary to create a cell - one of the most complex systems ever known - it then magically burst into life - and somehow after several billion years it managed to create a living breathing dinosaur. <br>  <br>  Isn't scientific explanation wonderful? lol. <br>  Call me weird. But creationism still seems more logical. :-)|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Creationism is nonsense, and it isn't scientific.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Neither evolution nor the Big Bang address the beginning of life. Abiogenesis is the theory about how life came about (from inanimate chemicals).|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Evolution and creationism cannot be combined in the sense of scientific theory because creationism is not scientific.<br>  <br>  However, an individual can reconcile creation beliefs with Evolution science by think of the creator as being the cause, and science as working out the details of how it works.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised more theists don't look at Evolution and feel even greater appreciation for God, except there's been a lot of groups, including religious conferences, Intelligent Design proponents (Discovery Institute, et al) who have made the argument about whether God exists vs. doesn't exist, as if Evolution theory had anything to do with that.<br>  <br>  That places theists in the position of feeling if they acknowledge Evolution, they deny God, instead of feeling free to look at scientific discovery and thinking, "Wow! God is great!"|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Cannot really be combined. Today's "evolution" as explained by Dawkins et. al. leaves no room for a creator because evolution is based on the notion of  "chance."  If any kind of creator has guided evolution in any way at all, then "chance" has not been allowed an opportunity to play and what we understand as "evolution" has not happened at all. <br>  While "creationists" do not have to be "young earthers," there's just no middle ground between creation and evolution.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	If they are both true, then they can be combined.  Truth cannot conflict with truth.  It is true that God brought all things into existence, including the actual matter and energy the universe is composed of.  It is also true that new species have evolved from earlier species even since life appeared on earth.  Therefore there is no conflict between these two truths.|`|AA11124121	ohhboy..the doogies come out on this one...|`|0hQyClksaa	Creation and evolutionary theory cannot be combined, they are mutually exclusive and antagonistic.<br>  <br>  First, the modern theory of evolution (the Synthetic theory of Evolution) only exists through assumptions, there are no facts supporting it what so ever.  All the so-called facts of biology that support the theory are facts of "functional" biology (or real biology), evolutionary biology is even admitted to as being untestable by top evolutionary writers, such as Ernst Mayr.<br>  <br>  You don't even have to be a creationist to look at the evolutionary model and see all the holes in it...there are plenty of non-creationist scientists that tell us that it isn't possible.  The biggest promulgators of evolutionary theory today are those in the public who haven't yet looked at the evidence...they only believe what they are told...blindly.<br>  <br>  Sounds familiar, hu?

2tn8EALqaa	A racial slur is a *word* used to negatively describe a race.<br>  I think the most infamous one would be the N word.<br>  There's a wikipedia article with common slurs for all races<br>  <br>  Yeah, H&K pokes a lot of fun at racism. You  have to be able to take a joke. I know some who liked it and some who feel awkward.<br>  <br>  Anyway, black people like grape soda. It's a stereotype like black people like fried chicken, kool aid and  (it's kind of "old" now) watermelon.<br>  Dave Chappelle has a funny video on it, but for you to find Chapelle funny,  you can't be sensitive<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuTjQLfU6Gk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuTjQLfU6...</a><br>  <br>  idk if I would call it "an act of racism".

py57svUyaa	Of course you can debate.  It does not mean that you have to change your views.  Outside of internet such a debate with educated individuals on both sides can be quite interesting.  You may learn something you did not know before. You may be able to see a point of view of the 'opposing' party.  The debate is not designed to convert anybody to anything. <br>  <br>  Though, the proof of god's existence is on the side of those that claim he exists.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Not according to the rules of debating. A debate is an argument between implications of facts. When one side has facts (atheists) and the other side has no evidence at all (theists), then it's not a debate - it's pointless conjecture that won't lead anywhere.|`|mefwTmwQaa	I find most people esp religious & atheists are too set in their ways so would be impossible to have a meaningful debate.Tho' would be interesting if 'they' managed to be unbiased..<br>  <br>  Don't see that happening so wouldn't waste my time..Yes,am religious but consider myself open & agree to disagree..<br>  <br>  Interesting question,starred for my contacts..|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	I think it is funny to watch theists rant about how they know reality isn't what you see but rather what you are told it must be .<br>  <br>  Read history and science and you will find all the proof you need that god doesn't exist .

Life itself should prove that He is there. Afterall, have scientists ever truly presented ant piece of evidence that proved God wasn't real? If they had, there would be no-one left who believed in God. Also, the majority of religions in the world believe in a God of some sort. If so many people believe in a God, or gods, then surely that presents us with intangible evidence that there is a God.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that debate will never be settled. If there is a God, then there is a Satan, or devil. He will always be twisting the hearts of men to go against God and will never stop. Even if there was evidence for either side, the debate would go on and on and on and on and on...<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!!|`|O5IzJLQPaa	I think it is annoying to debate about something obviously that is irrelevant. What people are arguing for is their ego, and what would make them feel better about themselves.|`|yN1gO4xaaa	It is pointless, because theists refuse to follow balanced debate rules and never actually defend their beliefs. They only attack atheism.|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	There Is God:<br>  <br>  Isaac Newton, had invited a scientist-friend of his, a man who professed atheism to dine with him. Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  The is a God, Allah almighty|`|xBd96wvRaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ethiologytoday.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethiologytoday.org/</a>|`|XR2BCYOSaa	The existence of a supreme being cannot be disproved,<br>  but the non-existence of the god in the BIBLE can easily be proved.<br>  Just think for a while.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	There are plenty of guys who can "prove" God exists, and there are plenty of guys who can "prove" God doesn't exist, and it all boils down to who's more clever, who's the better song-and-dance man. Ulrimately, of course, whatever we believe, we believe by faith. At least the real Christians are honest on that score, while the atheists try to pull the "proof" scam over on everybody.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Those debates usually do go round and round, but it might be interesting and fun nonetheless. Might have you squirming to say something, lol.<br>  <br>  Basically, it really is up to those who claim something exists to provide the proof -- like Big Foot, you know?<br>  <br>  Atheists have proof that nothing thus far observed and examined requires supernatural cause or intervention.|`|0hdo4WORaa	You can't prove a negative dimwit, the nonexistence of God is "proven" by the failure of the pro-side to mount a convincing, or indeed any, valid argument.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Unless God comes and raptures us & takes us to heaven (I'm saying us, but he'd leave me behind since I wouldn't believe in him if I saw him), there's no way to prove his existence.<br>  <br>  The fundamentalist arguments are that there are many things we can't understand & God had to make them (God of the Gaps). Every time we make a new discovery, that argument loses.<br>  <br>  Since I can't prove there is no God, that must mean He exists. Circular logic at it's worst. Since you can't prove the tooth fairy doesn't exist, I'll put my next tooth under my pillow & hope for a bail-out.<br>  <br>  People on both sides resort to attacks. It's either insecurity or frustration in hearing the same thing repeatedly. I try not to get personal, but sometimes it does feel good.<br>  <br>  I have no problem who believe in God to comfort them in times of crisis, but I don't need him & I don't like him being pushed onto me. I went to my nephews 1st communion & my mother (found her faith later in life) actually told me she hoped he wouldn't turn out like me. I know she loves me, but that kinda pi**ed me off.
R4EYPeLGaa	You would be willing to have sex with both sexes. Aka sexual attracted. And physically. <br>  <br>  Um, you sound confused.|`|N73oZyY8aa	The best of both worlds.|`|d0WaYTeGaa	Bisexuality refers to sexual behavior with[1] or physical attraction to people of both genders (male and female), or a bisexual orientation. People who have a bisexual orientation "can experience sexual, emotional, and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex"; "it also refers to an individual’s sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them."[2] It is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation, along with a heterosexual and a homosexual orientation. Individuals who do not experience sexual attraction to either sex are known as asexual.|`|IgHUhZs8aa	I think of bisexuality as the ability to have a strong relationship (including sex) with either sex, which leaves more options open for finding the perfect marriage partner. I'm not sure if you're bisexual if you wouldn't be able to hold up a relationship with a girl.|`|qOZashBYaa	Technically it does mean being attracted to two sexes, there is a more technical term for "love of two sexes" I just can't think of it.|`|36a547afe26601e8d97563dd0babb0aeaa	a person sexually responsive to both sexes|`|83275bbee3a48525b38d928f44cc193eaa	Bisexuality is not about sex, anymore than straight is about sex.  Bisexual means that "your able to fall in love" with someone of either sex.  You can have sex with someone of the same gender and not be bisexual or gay, it just means that your able to get off with either sex.  Straight, bi or gay are terms denoting who your going to fall in love with, not have sex with.  It just so happens that many porn actors are "gay for pay" meaning that they have sex with other men/women for money.  They don't fall in love with them, however.|`|ycjfzm9Naa	It means you could fall in love with either a guy or a girl. That you can have similar feelings for both genders.<br>  It sounds to me like you are straight. It's normal for teenagers to occasionally be physically attracted to someone of the same gender, but that's just hormones.|`|wn4k7EDBaa	it means that you could see urself spending the rest of your life with either a boy or a girl...

Gf8GzwADaa	hey michael, i do not think words could ever act as substitute for deeds. i do not think winning is more important than being (as long as being entails participation to the best of our ability) but i do think a little room must be made for philosophical musings, some concepts/ideas benefit from fine-tuning and from marinating. you (and i mean 'you' generally) just have to get good at discerning and distilling the essentials.  i expect that follows quick on the heels of realistic self-examination. <br>  <br>  i was having a chat with a friend about giving up smoking, should one just do it rather than talk about it? well, maybe, but sometimes voicing your intent, putting it outside of yourself, can be helpful. it can make one feel more 'accountable', one has a witness or two, it can muster support you would not otherwise have had, it can elicit surprising/inspired input, etc... <br>  <br>  i guess i agree with ray, all of these things (our thoughts, our words and our actions) should, in an ideal world, complement each other beautifully. the truth is they do not always, it's life, it's human expression and it's subject to all sorts of factors (external and internal - social/biological) so it's always going to be a little 'untidy' (like my rambling reply). thank you for asking :)|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Ah you fail to even think within the box let alone outside it!!!<br>  <br>  So lets take two people one has little verbal skills and a low IQ  They speak a lot to many people but cannot enthuse them or encourage them into action.

Our nation was built by immigrants who came to this country from England, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Russia, and other places, looking for freedom that they couldn't get in their homelands.<br>  <br>  When they got here, they developed a new sense of identity, because what they had left behind seemed backwards to them, compared to the freedoms and opportunities they found when they arrived here.<br>  <br>  Even our struggles -- painful though they may have been -- have served to strengthen our nation.<br>  <br>  Americans don't really care what the rest of the world thinks of them.  They are still the most individual, most self-sufficient nation on earth.  <br>  <br>  The fact that one snotty little brat refuses to capitalize the name of the nation that has done more to preserve and promote liberty to the globe than any other nation doesn't matter one whit.|`|J4lfOSPiaa	You clearly have issues, I am just not sure what they truly are because you seem to sometimes vacillate between Christian principles and Atheism.

That is becoming less common today as people give less thought to doing things the right way especially in the area of sex.

Keep up the good work.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about a purity ring, in fact I never heard of them, however the best advice I could give is; stay determine to please God(ps 83:18) in this area and ask for his help along the way.

You can pray the rosary often, in honor of Mary, Model of Purity.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend praying the rosary. It is explained here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary.

You're a very wise young lady.

AA10690306	He did write his own book but it was never included in the bible only the Gnostic texts.

All we have are the manuscripts which have survived and have been found.<br>  <br>  It is probable that if He had written His story, it would have been cherished and kept sacred, so He probably didn't do it.<br>  <br>  However, He did arrange to have a following of people from different walks of life to tell His story to.  Oral tradition was very important for the Jews.  <br>  <br>  Also, the accounts were not necessarily written down generations after His death.  We only have copies of those writings that are that old, but some of them were probably written down quite early in the first century and have not survived, but were copied over and over.<br>  <br>  And, I doubt if He was illiterate, since He was so well versed in the scriptures.<br>  <br>  As one of your other answerers said, He actually "wrote" all the books in the Bible, by inspiring men to write them down.

In fact, I would be willing to wager as you dig through history you'll find more than a few who influenced the world but never wrote anything down. That may not have been his priority. He may have wanted to focus on teaching his disciples, not scribble on some dried parchment in the middle of the desert so you the 21st century skeptic can finally "believe".

N26qrTd3aa	Honestly, it is normal to feel that way, especially when you hae not seen someone in awhile and maybe that connection of family is not really there as much as it would be otherwise.. but whether or not it is wrong is not for other people to decide. It is for you to decide.<br>  <br>  You have to consider a few things. Where do you live? What is socially acceptable where you live? I live in Alberta Canada and here it is legal to marry your first cousins.<br>  <br>  What were you raised to believe? Depending on where you live, this could be the same as the above question, or maybe your parents were different than the 'norm'<br>  <br>  Also, what do you honestly think of it. what are YOUR morals. Don't be a hypocrit, if one of your friends told you they were attracted to their cousin, what would you say?<br>  <br>  And remember, up until not that long ago 100, 200 years at most, it was common for people to marry their cousins, and it still happens, like I said, it's legal here. But all in all, whether or not it is wrong, thats a personal choice, like is abortion wrong? is being gay wrong? those are things you decide for yourself. Maybe google it.. do a little research, it might help you shed some light on your situation|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Honestly, I'm not one to judge anyone. It all depends on what YOU believe, not us. If you believe it's wrong, then don't act on those feelings. <br>  And there are plenty of fish in the ocean, your cousin isn't the only one out there.|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Ok.

You can't change that. However, it is wrong to act on some of those feelings, be it ethically, morally, religiously, or legally.|`|36a547afe26601e8d97563dd0babb0aeaa	to tell you the truth hon but i really don't think so unless its a blood relation but that's what i think if your attracted to your cousin then it's none of our business but yours.So keep on keepin' on|`|XtHsBlJKaa	ya most definitely ,  sorry|`|wRow3wC1aa	yeah i think so and i live in Alabama.  what does that tell u<br>  <br>  ur to pretty to be thinking about ur cousin|`|fdxIZDtOaa	yea|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Honestly I don't think so|`|figdYH23aa	depends ... Is it blood relation.. if so.. srry but ya|`|83275bbee3a48525b38d928f44cc193eaa	No, its pretty much par for the course during your life.  Acting on it is whats weird, lol.  Most states have laws forbidding it, however some don't.  Unless your double cousins (2 brothers marrying 2 sisters, etc.) then your pretty safe.  If your double cousins, your children will be closer genetically with their first cousins than with their own brothers/sisters.|`|fcc7856dd791af88dcfae5a97c0e8d21aa	Well I got with my cousin and we have a 10 yr old daughter together. We weren't actually 1st cousins, (turns out that his Dad was the result of an affair my grandmother had, but we didn't know that until much later). I ended up having to get a restraining order to get him out of my life, (this is after all I spent a few years dealing with family that was SHOCkED that we were together, he turned out to be so jealous and violent that I never want to see him again. All I can say is careful what you wish for.........(something he told me in the very beginning that I should have listened to).|`|ycjfzm9Naa	No it's not. I believe it's illegal to do anything about it, but an attraction isn't wrong. Besides, children born of first cousins don't actually have any birth defects. <br>  First cousins are far enough away in DNA and genes.|`|8Lo80IcDaa	No.|`|71U41QLAaa	lol yeah kind of :)<br>  x|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	yes|`|AA11287806	It is murky territory as you have the same grand parents.  So from a genetic point of view there is still quite a close link.  Having said that there is more 'distance' then say a brother or sister I don't think there is anything illegal about having any sort of relationship.  So, whilst it wouldn't be for me, so long as you tread carefully and prepare yourself for possible problems with other family members  then follow your heart!|`|N73oZyY8aa	I think so.

I guess it just comes down to common courtesy.<br>  You're probably going to hate me for this, but I tend to get a little irritated when people ask to get stars (apart from you of course!!) as I don't just think people should get 'em because they ask for them.

But it's a slow indoctrination process, and by the time you're to the point of hearing this kind of stuff, you're ready to accept it.<br>  <br>  man.<br>  <br>  DOUGHBOY completely missed the point.  what a rant.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	It looks like you're quoting from the Watchtower CD but you're quoting old testament in the Bible. The old law was done away with when Christ came, meaning he fulfilled the old laws.<br>  <br>  But what I am wondering is why did you just pick on the Witnesses when these scriptures are in everyone's Bible? In that case all Christians, if they still were going by the old law, would be up to ridicule. Why are you only picking out Jehovah's Witnesses?<br>  <br>  Here, what about these scriptures of the new testament, also found in EVERYONE's BIBLES??<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11<br>  <br>  What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet <br>  that is what some of YOU were. <br>  ------------------<br>  <br>  Acts 10: 34 - 35:<br>  <br>  ...."God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him"..<br>  ------------------<br>  <br>  James 1: 12 - 15<br>  <br>  Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which GOD promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 3: 8 - 10<br>  <br>  "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  Psalms 37: 8 - 11:<br>  <br>  Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. ?For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.<br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  The old testament is vital to the new, however you lack accurate knowledge in how when Christ came he fulfilled the old law, so why are you stuck on Deuteronomy and seeming to blame what was written in YOUR OWN BIBLE on the Witnesses some how?<br>  <br>  Look, get smart and don't do this anymore. Furthermore, the truth is contained in the Bible:<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3: 16 - 17 tells us unequivocally:<br>  <br>  All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  So why are you knocking God's word, the Bible if ALL SCRIPTURE IS INSPIRED BY GOD, and why are you making the witnesses your improper example? Don't do this anymore and think before you post.|`|pCLC481qaa	Obedience, devotion, loyalty, integrity & commitment are part of being faithful and true to that which one believes in at all cost.<br>  <br>  I know this to the depths. To do all that is within your power to serve & please Jehovah with all my heart.<br>  <br>  The problem was I found out that the ones making the doctrines and the sacrificial demands wasn't Jehovah. <br>  <br>  Jesus was the final sacrifice. He wasn't requiring me to sacrifice myself or my family as I had done. <br>  Jesus is about unconditional love, mercy and grace. <br>  <br>  What makes a religion a cult?<br>  When they take away the personal freedom that Christ freely gave to ALL humans. He gave us liberty. When one is not allowed to think for themselves, make their own choices. Learn from all that life has to offer. Be accountable & responsible for those choices, knowing that they are still loved.<br>  <br>  To stand up against the organization (other religions too) many times means one will be excluded my those who choose to be part of the religion.<br>  <br>  The question is then who really is the apostate?<br>  Is it not the one who proudly accuses the innocent?<br>  <br>  <br>  I will still remain one with obedience, devotion, loyalty, integrity & commitment as part of my being faithful and true to that which I believes in at all cost. <br>  BUT not to a religion fulled with man made doctrines!<br>  Continuing to do all that is within my power to serve & please My Heavenly Father with all my heart.|`|xU0xtg2zaa	I ask my JW parents this ALL THE TIME, especially when i know they dont have "divine" help like they did in the OT. They just call me rebellious. I dont see why we should listen to some quacks thats are inherently equal to me. My parents think that God is working through them as much as God was working through Moses. Its laughable to me. They were just men who through there understanding of the bible, started a religion and decided THEY were the "faithful and discreet slave". Wtf?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I know people who have gotten disfellowshiped for questioning the Watchtower and the governing body. To me, its like, SHOULDN'T we be questioning, when they have NO divine intervention whatsoever? They were men who questioned traditional teachings. Its not like they are Moses. They expect to be treated as prophets and to not "lean upon our own understanding", while they are doing just that, and demanding full dedication and trust in THEIR judgement.|`|AA12291184	i don't believe in their religion.<br>  <br>  they velive that ONLY them are going to heaven.<br>  <br>  that is simply NOT true.

MSWgVj4Maa	I have never seen one piece of evidence that proves to me that god/gods are anything more than mans attempt to explain the unknown. 2000 years ago man knew that the sun was a god driving a fiery chariot around the world,  a few hundred years ago man knew the sun orbited the earth, and today you know god exists. See a pattern they had just as much evidence as you do.|`|SuBRC6BJaa	I see no reason to believe that a god exists.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!<br>  <br>  Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!!

God is in fact superfluous.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Atheism isn't like choosing a denomination. When someone realizes they just don't believe there's a personal god or gods, they can then know they are atheist.

83275bbee3a48525b38d928f44cc193eaa	Because a great many of us can/could or do pass for "straight."  So, unless we make them aware that we're gay, we basically, by withholding this information keep them "in the dark" so to speak.  By coming out of the closet we make them aware that we're gay, and what that means, to us AND them.  If they were your friends before, they will be after, also.  However, by staying 'hidden' we do not do them a favor or ourselves, by coming out we show them that not only do they know someone gay, their friends with them too.|`|YbWQh3scaa	Because, the attic is scary, so is the basement.|`|DZFoyOvyaa	hmmmmmmmm i never really though about it mayby its because the closet is a good place to hide or in my case it has lots of pretty shoes to look at|`|eGvyFeW9aa	Because the Earth is a sphere.|`|kHYHFwkYaa	lol i dont no.. good question...|`|fdc721c8e9fa936f998a77bb5b1c3b0aaa	Ok, so I think that they use coming out of the closet because you know how on tv when the kid always cleans his room, it APPEARS to be clean, but really he just shoved everything in the closet, well its similar with gay people, we APPEAR to be straight in most or many cases, so when we come out to everyone, its like when the kid opens the closet door and says "I lied, my room isn't really clean"...so we are opening the closet doors and saying "I lied, Im not really straight"<br>  Well this is what I think.

Also Allah has made men and women and given each qualities and strengths that make them excel in their roles. And they are best suited for those roles and they do them best. When Allah has said that both men and women are equal and I've made them the best, than who are we to debate about what gender is better. <br>  <br>  Lets maybe talk about things like religion and role of women/men, politics, education, sports, medicine etc. Something meaningful.

I think that many Atheists bash Christianity in a hateful manner for no good reason, just as I think some "Christians" on this site are hateful in the way they respond to others.

Little white lies to save people's feelings for example. Lies that can save lives. Unintentional lies. They all happen. As long as they are not intended to hurt, are not big, are not in a court of law, and are done out of a kind heart, then I don't really see anything wrong. I just woudn't make a habit out of it.

I would say that those morals are the result of evolution.  The need to cooperate means that sources of conflict within the tribe, family, group or culture need to be reduced or eliminated, and banning those behaviors you mention is a strong step toward doing away with the most serious of the sources of conflict.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean when you say you love your neighbors.  I like my neighbors, for the most part, and I help them out when they are in need, whether that means shoveling their walks because they are too ill or infirm to do so, or giving one a ride to the store, or helping to fight a brush fire in the back forty.

vGWD8Zncaa	I'm not atheist but I am not part of any organized religion.<br>  <br>  There are a couple things which steered me away from religion<br>  <br>  First is the aspect that "religion" tended to be more about dogma and belief as opposed to a forum for the exploration of spiritual ideas and open discussion.  I was never able to believe in the dogma despite early efforts to try to believe.  It's more complicated but that's the basic story.<br>  <br>  Second, though, is what I most wanted to mention.  And that is that the PEOPLE who are "Christians" have done a considerable amount to alienate me from Christianity.  I don't say this with arrogance or hate but simple fact.  Their actions in the name of their faith do little to endear me and make me wish to join them.  The hypocrisy of claiming to "love and understand" and yet look down their noses at those who don't have the same beliefs has not been endearing.  Niether has been the judgmental attitudes... or the propensity to embrace far-right political candidates such as Cheney and W (who are in stark contrast to the values taught by Jesus).  The holding on to notions like "young Earth creationism" and denial of science in addition to other narrow views upon the scripture has pushed me away.<br>  <br>  Not to say ALL Christians are like this.  Far from it.  But the majority attitudes have been all too much as I describe.  And this has pushed me away from whatever temptation I might have had for being a Christian, dogma aside.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	over the course of history, thousands of gods ( <a href="http://www.godchecker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.godchecker.com/</a> ) have been dreamed up.<br>  <br>  Most people think the only one that's real is the one their parents told them was real. Coincidence?<br>  <br>  Nobody has ever provided any evidence that any gods, much less a specific god, exist. People believe in specific gods because of indoctrination from an early age, tradition, apophenia, hallucinations, fear of torture (for gods sadistic enough to threaten it) and other similarly illogical reasons. But no gods exist in reality; these are all stories, created for people who were scared of the world long before we understood it. Now we have no more reason for these superstitions.<br>  <br>  And religious belief has caused more misery than any other idea throughout history.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I didn't make a choice not to believe in god(s), it was just a realisation that I can't force myself to believe in something I know is illogical and unsubstantiated.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	I was raised religious, and when I got old enough to think for myself and learn to question things, I did a lot of studying and looking and eventually came to the conclusion that I don't believe in god because I have no evidence of him/her/it.

You know i once asked him what about the bad bits which is about 99% of it. what bad bits he says. the murder, the genocide, the rape, the slavery. i was quite clued up on the bible, you see first year at high school, we had history, and it kind of taught us thoese bad bits. This minister dude, told me to forget about the bad bits and concentrate on the good bits. <br>  <br>  I never thought much about it really at the time, i was never going to believe in God just like 100% of my class did not believe either, no matter what..

I think I have heard my mother say once that she does not believe in god, then on another ocassion I think I heard her say she hates god??? I felt a yearning, or a pull from the age of about 15. I thought this pull was towards the direction of religion. I studied religion, many forms of it until I was about 26. It was then I realised that religion is the problem not the answer. We are spiritual beings...it stands to reason the answer is spirituality. For me personally, spirituality is the word I use to describe myself, who believes in Karma, reincarnation, the after life, the interconnectedness with everything in existence, a supreme power, whether that be inside or outside of ourselves, I harm no one, give what and when I can, am sympathetic, and empathetic to others, don't put up with crap from those that dish it out, love the environment, fauna and flora, not so keen on mankind.<br>  My belief in Karma and reincarnation is the single one thing that makes every thing in life fair. Is my good or bad life that I live now, retribution or reward for a previous one? This is the mystery and the thing that makes it fair because I do not know. However if I were to believe in christianity for example, and I ended up in a wheelchair for life, well I would think that unfair if I hadn't actually caused harm to another during this life time...because that's all they have to go on.<br>  <br>  Religion trades on fear and oppression, and as spiritual beings these do not aligned.|`|SavvSFIXaa	1.

I usually don't even tell religious people I'm atheist because they assume I'm a close-minded negative nancy that GROSSLY oversimplifies two thousand years worth of theological discourse because "OH GOD IS LIEK AN IMAGINARY FREND FOR GROWN UPS LOL".  <br>  <br>  The only reason that I am atheist is that I do not feel in my heart that there is a God.  If I could truly believe it then I would be religious but for some reason I just can't.  I think that there are so many advantages that people of faith have over people of no faith.   It is proven that people of faith have a greater chance of surviving illness and injury.  <br>  <br>  Particularly after reading Augustine's Confessions I realized how much more there is the theology than the ignorant observations of most atheists today.  People like the ones who have left rude answers in this thread embarrass me.  We are supposed to live in a society where everybody is treated equally and our religions and beliefs are respected. I can't believe we live in a world where it's perfectly normal to get up in the morning and read your horoscope, but people who believe in a God are "stupid."|`|uBlkHRnuaa	I was raised by an atheist father and pagan mother. My mom believes in Gods and Goddesses, but she never pushed any of her beliefs on me. My dad can't stand any religion. I used to go to church because my friends did and I discovered that Christianity above all religions is total brainwash. Christianity is a plague of stupidity, gullibility, and hypocrisy. Hence the name Hypo-Christianity. It's slavery, and due to many of my friend's religious parents, has caused so much grief. Due to the fact I do not go to church, my boyfriend's father won't ever let him see me any longer. His father won't let him have his hair a tiny bit long, he cannot wear the clothes he likes without fighting, he can't express his taste in music and he can't even watch TV unless it is rated G and he's 17. Is this love and acceptance like "Jesus" wanted? **** Jesus and all Christians, you're a bunch of ignorant ***** and need to die. Go to the hell that you people so desperately try to avoid by being total HYPOCRITES. Oh wait, it doesn't exist, and neither does heaven. You're being a slave for nothing! It's like having someone constantly slap your hand telling you what to and what not to do. I say **** it, I'm not going to be a slave for anyone or anything, even your stupid make-believe "God." God is for those who are weak and cannot deal with things on their own, so they think praying to absolutely nothing will help them with their problems. No matter how shitty the world or anyone's life gets, is God there for you? NO. And I can't stand those that think everything good must be from God and that they have no strength within themselves and that God gives it to them. Just **** off, weak pieces of ****.|`|Wm24YP6caa	I'm still undecided with my religious beliefs, but I would guess that some people might say because of logic.

There is a lot of information on them on the Wiki.  If you go to the Wiki, you'll learn all about the three degrees of masonry and a lot more.<br>  <br>  The promise one makes is to keep the secrets, as stated above, secret under an allegorical penalty of painful death.

It very much was a matter of national security in some cases, (as with palaces or fortifications) so it was a very necessary thing at that time.<br>  <br>  Naturally, the actual trade secrets of stone masonry are irrelevant to the fraternity of Freemasonry. But from the ancient tradition, there is an important lesson in fidelity and honor to be learned from it. The obligation of Freemasonry (an obligation BTW is not the same as a vow or oath) is a reference and remembrance of this archaic code of honor, noting that it is worth emulating, but not designed or suggested to be fully imitated. <br>  <br>  Freemasonry has no true secrets, so it is impossible to actually tell them, much less be punished for doing so. As with much of Masonic education, the obligations are symbolic and metaphoric, used as a way to indirectly express a more important lesson of morality. <br>  <br>  Any man may choose to break his obligation, many have to no ill effect. The worst "punishment" he will face is suspension or expulsion from the fraternity, and not have his dues refunded.

The restaurant served chicken and ribs and catered to an older crowd. Anyways the owner was a crap member and he was dating the manager there. She had a bone for me and Anthony. Being that I was raised Atheist- the expression "Jesus Christ!" meant nothing to me. So one day, when I was slammed I said "Jesus Christ!" (to myself of course) and a customer over heard me and told on me for swearing. She yelled at me something fierce for swearing and I had no idea what she was talking about- that was not swearing to me. Now if I said ****- then I would understand. Anyways, I am guessing that she will feel pretty stupid for that- and also for making so much trouble for me and Anthony.|`|AA10556726	I rarely, if ever, use those.  They are common expressions and are easy to use as a explicative.  A more important question is why would a Christian use those, especially as they do believe in a Higher Power?|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Language usage is not primarily about propositional content.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Just common expressions ingrained into our brains because of the Christian-based society within which we live...|`|TeJuytjZaa	I usually don't.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	I was wondering the same too.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Why do people say "Holy Cow!" if they're not Hindu?|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Because it's a common expression.  If I say "holy ****" it doesn't mean I believe in divine excrement.  If I say "gesundheit" when someone sneezes it doesn't mean I'm German.  If I say "f_ck you" to someone it doesn't mean I want to know them in the "biblical sense", although it can.<br>  <br>  EDIT  - Re Cathy's answer and other similar comments, as Freud would have said, "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar".|`|355JLlcLaa	At one time, the expression "By Jove" wasn't uncommon. And it might have been uttered by a Christian. <br>  <br>  Many might exclaim "Bloody .... " without realising that it derived from what in modern English would be "By Our Lady".<br>  <br>  It's become part of common language, and is more an expression of shock, surprise, or even fear, than of faith.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	same then you say Thursday without believing in Thor.

It hurts me to think that the religious beliefs I had when I was a child just can't be true, and that when I die, it's all over. Sometimes it makes me cry.

U5LZDb68aa	you do what I do and that;s to call cooperate and go above their heads they need to be fired for their actions and be lucky your not suing them which if it continues I would think about doing but first call corporate and just explain how incredibly rude they are to you and what they have said about the reason for being rude I promise you this will get their attention McDonald's  toll-free telephone number is 1-800-244-6227 and Wal-Marts number is  1-800-966-6546 both will be more than happy to listen to you in fear of being sued, solve your problem with the employees and will offer you a free meal and a gift card for bringing it to their attention I have had to deal with similar things with McDonald's before because they hire people still in school that most just don't care if they keep their jobs or not I'm so sorry for the way they have treated you and please for the sake of the others they have done this too that may not be able to stand their ground when someone is doing them wrong call the numbers I gave you if nothing else to know you may have kept someone else from treated like that.|`|32d69300213c54018bab3031b85b4dc1aa	I would just ignore all those RUDE people, and eat your food and go about your shopping, people are going to talk about other people no matter who you are or what ever you have done, they will find fault in someone, just remember one thing keep your head high and think posative and a smile on your face|`|7VzbVzBnaa	If you feel you are being slighted, write a CONCISE letter to the McDonald's corporate office.

Being autistic doesn't mean anything but the fact that you experience the world differently to others. <br>  <br>  Instead of ordering your usual order, Jazz things up a bit to keep them on their toes. Order a Medium McChicken meal with lemonade and one chocolate chip cookie, as well as a chocolate sundae. Go out of your way to be nice to them and make them feel guilty for being so mean to you.<br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse, complain to the manager. ;} you may even get a free meal.|`|Iov5Z7O4aa	I am afraid the complexities of this problem, and some explanatory comments on some of the other y/a answerer's VERY fine answers, mean that: <br>  <br>  Given space limitations of y/a in giving an answer, it means that I will have to send you my answer in a series of emails.  (Since the space limitations of each email mean only a part of my answer can be sent in each one!)<br>  <br>  Basically, other than agreeing with all that has been said here by others before me, and that I think they should all have best answer, my comments expand on theirs, and fine tune them, so that your complaint efforts will have a better chance of being successful.<br>  <br>  I hate doing it this way, but while y/a is a wonderful thing, it is so shaky and unreliable (much like internet in my area) that sometimes, my real answers, which are written in wordpad, cannot be dumped into y/a, as that causes the poor thing to crash... <br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|OI7b0xnRaa	in Britain, a complaint letter should do the trick. [thats for the mcdonalds employees] <br>  as for the bastards that give your evil looks for no apparent reason , i would say just ignore them. and if it bugs u so bad , just go and speak to them, it would definitely shock and confuse them and would show them that you do notice these things and that they should back off and start treating you better. <br>  hope this helps.|`|eRuE2F1Saa	I agree with the above-write a concise letter to the management and the main office.  Most fast food establishments have quality control standards and are VERY interested in seeing them followed.  Dealing with all sorts of people is part of the service industries job.  They ares supposed to be professional.<br>  <br>  As far as their behavior towards  you when they are not behind the counter, yes it is unacceptable. They sound like they are rude and may not be practicing what they preach-remember, Christians are not perfect and  there is a wide range in our behavior as well.  Sometimes it can make me cringe  as well, sometimes big time-all I can do is pray and realize there are some things that maybe they just don't "get  yet".  But that does not make you feel better at the time.  <br>  <br>  I love the fact that you enjoy the bus ride and enjoy doing things to make  your life enjoyable.  Writing a letter may help you claim part of your own personal power back-if nothing else, it will have an effect on your power as a consumer. Maybe this location won't change right away, but maybe you can be part of the mechanism that will get it started.  Good luck-I know it hurts when people are rude and cruel.  It will return to them eventually unless they make some major changes.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	First let me say that I am a Christian and I would never treat someone this way. It's ridiculous. Even if you were a stark-raving looney (which clearly you're not) it's really hurtful to avoid touching you while giving you change. <br>  And this "friend" of yours who works there doesn't sound like any kind of friend to me. I'd lose her like a bad habit!<br>  As far as how to handle the situation; it depends on what they do. If they become overtly rude (like really obvious staring/whispering) I would calmly tell them that you are not crazy, but that what they are doing is rude and it hurts. I might also tell them that you had been thinking of becoming a Christian but their attitude changed your mind (that'll get 'em!) Just keep it short and matter of fact if it comes to that. <br>  Otherwise, just ignore them and don't let them ruin your good time in Wal*Mart. <br>  <br>  P.S. for what it's worth, I wouldn't think you seemed crazy based on what you're describing. I think these people are just shallow, bored and immature. :)|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	What do you want to happen?  Just because you are hurt and saddened doesn't' mean they are going to change, even if asked to change.  Some people are just a**holes so just ignore them.  I used to work in the business center of a supermarket.  Though we were supposed to excell in customer service, every single one of my co-workers would mock certain of the so called, "crazy" people that came in there day by day.<br>  <br>  There was a certain woman named Angie who is autistic, carries around a radio and talks to herself.  Not only was I nice to her, I offered her rides when I saw her around the town and always went out of my way to talk to her.  This alienated me from the rude ***** club, but I didn't care... <br>  <br>  Point of the matter is, they all knew it was wrong to act like that to that woman and they didn't give a dang about changing.  If you can't ignore it, go to another place where you will be appreciated.  Don't put yourself through something you can't handle.
EHozsofQaa	You have to fill in the blanks by conjugating the verbs in parentheses using the passe compose.<br>  <br>  "Nous avons pris le bus." (meaning: "We took the bus.")<br>  <br>  In this case (in spite of what the booklet is asking for), we don't form the passe compose with the auxilliary verb "etre". With the verb "prendre", we use "avoir". So I'm suspecting that there's a mistake in the brackets: it is written "etre", but it should really be "avoir". "Nous etions pris dans le bus." exists as well, but this is just the passive form, and in the latter case, it has the meaning of "being stuck in the bus". That's most likely not what the sentence is supposed to mean, especially since the point of this exercise is about building sentences with the passe-compose, not about the passive.|`|AQELdkXlaa	<a href="http://allanswering.moowuz.com" rel="nofollow">http://allanswering.moowuz.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|YWm5RXGCaa	Im pretty sure this is it, prendons :D

There are three classifications of the disorder. Osmotic, Secrotary, and Exudative types. Diarrhea is caused by many factors like medications, and poor diet, dehydration and many other factors. Basically it is a virus that effects the gut.<br>    You can let it run its coarse or take over the counter meds like popular Pepto Bismol. IBS problems might need to consult a Physican.

jQxkBrkraa	minion of satan, that's real nice..<br>  I have had my prayers answered, many times.  I was a single mom, working, paying my bills, and caring for two small boys. I knew nothing about gov. assistance, we were not raised on that. One day me and my boys got home, from work, and daycare.  As soon as we walk in the apartment, my boys said that they were hungry. I went to the frig. and it was empty. I looked in the cabinets, they were empty. I told my boys to go play outside,and that dinner would be ready when they came in, and when they did come in they said that they were hungry. I told them that they should take a bath, and that when they got out that, dinner would be ready. When they got out, they said that they were hungry, I told them that they had already played,bathed , and that they should take a nap, and that dinner would be ready when they awoke. During there time of play,bath, and nap, I kept looking in the frig, and cabinets, there was nothing, nothing in the cabinets, not an egg, or a can of corn.  <br>  At that time I just got on my knees and cried out to the lord. I said Lord they are your children too. I cried, and prayed. I was going to let my boys sleep through the night with out supper. I was just so upset I could not stop crying or praying. I was not getting any child-support. Nothing not a bag of pampers, or a bag of potatoes, not a can of formula or a gal of milk. (damm dead beat dad).  I kept looking in the frig. and cabinets, nothing.  Then there was someone at my door. And lo and behold, it was my mom.  I let her in and she had 3 large paper bags of groc. I said what are you doing here? She said that my dad had left her a ck to buy groc. and that she had been at her sisters house all day. She said that while she was in the store she just decided to put a few things in for me. She had me help her take down the rest of the bags, and once she had taken out what she had bought me, I had about 4 bags of groc. During my Mothers arivial  my boy  had woke up. It was to late to make something to eat , so I allowed them to have coco puffs for dinner.  God is Good !  I cried out and he heard my prayer. At that moment I learned two things. 1. The power of prayer. 2. I learned to manage my money more carefully. Nothing is impossible with the Lord. My God is an Awesome God! My God he was, my God, he is, My God he's always gonna be.      Coincidence? I don't think so to begin with I lived 20 miles from my parents house. My father, is old school. There your kids you take care of them. We ( my sister and I ) never asked our parents for any thing, that was dad's rule no.1.  Blessings to you!! In Christ, ME!!!|`|RYoOwFJ9aa	Several times actually.  The first time was in college when my girlfriends best friend was visiting.  She had to return to her home town because her brother had been shot in the head and was in critical condition.  He might not make it through the night.  After I returned to my apartment I bathed, shaved and spent the whole night praying to God for her brothers life.  I felt the holy spirit with me and the next morning I called her to tell her that her brother would be alright.  A week later he got out of the hospital.  Within a few months he was walking again.<br>  The second time was when I was very depressed even though I had everything I wanted.  I asked God to show me the way.  He introduced me to my wife who coincidentally had asked God for the same thing at about the same time.  She has been the helper that God promised me and has kept me on the straight and narrow with God.  Since then there have been several miracle's done for me by God.  <br>  <br>  How do I know it was God?  Simple I was a horrible student especially in foreign languages.  I went to Mexico to party and instead mastered the Spanish language in four weeks, had a girlfriend in the US dump me as soon as I left the country, and found a new girlfriend who made me want to serve my God again.  When I saw her I said "That's why you brought me here".  Ten months later we were married.  God takes our weeknesses and turns them into streangths.  It's now been 16 years and I thank God for all of them.|`|VPpZ2TbQaa	As All Powerful and Great Intelligent, why would God decide to make it rain when a child on earth asked unless it was His purpose? He answers many prayers, prayers that are for our good and our well-being. He does not answer prayers for no reason at all and usually when asking for rain, people only want a sign of God. But He works through faith, where would the faith lie if it turns to knowledge?|`|LFTkpjGnaa	Yes.|`|Nw8xop5qaa	Yes- although I won't say what- and I know because I have faith.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	God answers my every prayer. Sometimes His answer is no - or I have a better idea. <br>  <br>  Always pray God's will and not your own and your every prayer will be answered too.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Yes.  I once prayed that God would reveal the full depth of darkness within my soul.  I figured it would give me a sense of where I needed to make adjustments.  What I discovered was that I am capable of literally anything.  There was just no bottom.  Could all of the myriad events of 15 years be coincidence?  I suppose they could.  But I do know that I got what I thought I wanted.  Someone once said that there are more tears caused by answered prayers than by those unanswered.  That was certainly true in my case.<br>  <br>  peace|`|tI1NHwfBaa	You don't understand the concept of prayer.<br>  <br>  Prayer isn't a magic incantation that makes the world comply with your wishes.  Prayer is something that changes us, the way we deal with our circumstances, the stresses and pressures that we endure.<br>  <br>  Yes, I've had a great many prayers answered.<br>  <br>  Most of the answers I get seem to be very different than what I prayed for, and that means they're better.  A great many times I get no answer.  Still other times, the answer seems to be a definite no.<br>  <br>  I'm not comfortable giving examples, because I don't think those things are done for me to parade in front of people.  Be assured that my prayers are not for material things, and they often result in me learning or growing in some way.|`|dYQUQGflaa	Answered.  Yep.  The answer was no.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	There are no coincidences in God's creation.|`|jwKOANhpaa	I was a christian for 16 years, and it never happened.  I gave up.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	Yes, my parents prayed for 23 years to hav a son because they couldnt have one of their own and had tried desperately to adopt one but they couldnt. and then a woman said to my mom one day after talking to her "I am about to have a baby, would you like to adopt it".  And that child was me. And my biological mother went through everything that they do to convince you to keep your baby but she didnt want to keep me.    And God must of blessed me because I drowned when I was 3 and i literally "died" and I saw the light, and it must of not been my time because I saw the light recede and I saw myself at the bottom of the pool I had just drowned in.  then i looked up and a guy had jumped in and was retrieving me from the bottom of the pool.  So i was ok.  Anyway praying for 23 years sounds like a time of praying but God answered their prayers, and i dont think thats just coincedince, that my mom happened to meet that nice woman.     so yea, thnx for reading part of my lifestory.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Yes, two times that I am still in awe of years later.

AA11440601	The clergy did not burn people at the stake. Civil authorities did.<br>  <br>  Modern historians have long known that the popular view of the Inquisition is a myth. The Inquisition was actually an attempt by the Catholic Church to stop unjust executions. <br>  <br>  Heresy was a capital offense against the state. Rulers of the state, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics. Neither did common people, who saw heretics as dangerous outsiders who would bring down divine wrath. <br>  <br>  When someone was accused of heresy in the early Middle Ages, they were brought to the local lord for judgment, just as if they had stolen a pig. It was not easy to discern whether the accused was really a heretic. The lord needed some basic theological training, very few did. The sad result is that uncounted thousands across Europe were executed by secular authorities without fair trials or a competent judge of the crime. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church's response to this problem was the Inquisition, an attempt to provide fair trials for accused heretics using laws of evidence and presided over by knowledgeable judges. <br>  <br>  From the perspective of secular authorities, heretics were traitors to God and the king and therefore deserved death. From the perspective of the Church, however, heretics were lost sheep who had strayed from the flock. As shepherds, the pope and bishops had a duty to bring them back into the fold, just as the Good Shepherd had commanded them. So, while medieval secular leaders were trying to safeguard their kingdoms, the Church was trying to save souls. The Inquisition provided a means for heretics to escape death and return to the community.<br>  <br>  Most people tried for heresy by the Inquisition were either acquitted or had their sentences suspended. Those found guilty of grave error were allowed to confess their sin, do penance, and be restored to the Body of Christ. The underlying assumption of the Inquisition was that, like lost sheep, heretics had simply strayed.<br>  <br>  If, however, an inquisitor determined that a particular sheep had purposely left the flock, there was nothing more that could be done. Unrepentant or obstinate heretics were excommunicated and given over to secular authorities. Despite popular myth, the Inquisition did not burn heretics. It was the secular authorities that held heresy to be a capital offense, not the Church. The simple fact is that the medieval Inquisition saved uncounted thousands of innocent (and even not-so-innocent) people who would otherwise have been roasted by secular lords or mob rule.<br>  <br>  Where did this myth come from? After 1530, the Inquisition began to turn its attention to the new heresy of Lutheranism. It was the Protestant Reformation and the rivalries it spawned that would give birth to the myth. Innumerable books and pamphlets poured from the printing presses of Protestant countries at war with Spain accusing the Spanish Inquisition of inhuman depravity and horrible atrocities in the New World. <br>  <br>  For more information, see:<br>  The Real Inquisition, By Thomas F.

They equate the ruthless, bloodthirsty behavior of their ancestors as no more no less than the incredible evil of Eve in listening to a talking snake.|`|MCjRxrjlaa	"I know other churches have done other things but the claim of Catholics is they are the true Church."<br>  <br>  This implies that -other- churches don't sell themselves as 'the one true church'. I fail to see a difference between Catholics harming people and protestants harming people.<br>  <br>  The end result is the same.

I would say the greatest threat to gay rights are bigoted people like Chris Buttars.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	no !  i do not agree, its his opinion.<br>  <br>  example: when i was a teenager i believed that sex drugs and rock n roll were the greatest evils. but only because i was naive and limited in experience and understanding.
uK3tkaOJaa	Sure I'll read it.  I suspect it will confirm that with a positive attitude and belief in getting better, this can improve your odds of recovery.  God isn't necessarily required for that.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Of course Faith can heal, for does not the lord say that with out Faith that there can be no Miracles It is true. Faith means  to believe and put your trust in God and thru your obedience in keeping his commandments you can move mountains .I went out on the lake with a canoe fishing and the wind started to pick up so I went to land way out and fished off the shore. The wind only got stronger and stronger and it was getting time for me to head back and I was concern that the weaves would tip my small canoe over. I got in and started going and the waves were almost coming into my boat so that scared me some what so I.. thought to make a prayer to the lord if he would clam the lake so that I could get back to were my car was parked and that was a long ways away. I prayed and then started going again .As I was paddling fast fighting against the wind I did not notice at first that the waters had not been so hi anymore and that the wind had calm down until I look twice and realized that the water was calm just small ripples going pass me and as I turned a bend and look around the whole lake was calm. I knew that the lord had answered my prayer in calming the lake and seeing to my safety, and I thanked him. This happened twice and on two different lakes in different time of the year. The lord answers prayers how strong is your faith do you put your trust in your Heavenly Father for I do, and I see what he does for me.|`|nEc0L0MRaa	Just because we don't understand how something works, doesn't mean it doesn't work.

Clearly, Time is playing to the faithful.<br>  But, in reading the article, it doesn't really support that prayer works, and in fact notes that if the sick person doesn't know that people are praying for them, it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  The placebo effect has been proven very powerful.  i.e. if a person believes the magic pill will make a difference (even if the magic pill is prayer) we do see a difference.  Mind over body, however, doesn't prove the existence of an invisible deity.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Well belief causes stigmata, and hysterical brian tumors and pregnancies. So I wouldn't be surprised to hear faith "faked" a cure.

AA10311549	I think it somewhat ironic.  Many "Fundamentalists Christians" are jumping on the "Intelligent Design" bandwagon to help convince people that there had to be a God who created the universe.

xxijbx4Waa	hello,<br>  none of us avoid each other.<br>  there is much diversity in my family as far as which faith to follow.<br>  me,my parents,and some of my uncles and aunts attend a non-denominational church.<br>  my siblings dont go to church.<br>  my mother-in-law is mormon.<br>  there are some catholics,and others attend various protestant churches.<br>  there are just a couple of family members who are spiritually immature and drive a wedge between us.<br>  but for the most part,we all are respectful of each beliefs,and enjoy the fact that we are seeking salvation.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Yes, I don't have any sibling but I avoid my Mom like the plague. She is always making fun of me and mu kids for being Muslim and wearing hijab. My Dad is very cool about things and acceots us as we are.|`|iBcqLtT3aa	Well, my dad was a Catholic priest, but our relationship is pretty good. I enjoy discussing religion/god with him a lot, maybe more than he does. He is not too judgmental and he does understand my POV. My mom is a little more sensitive, so I don't really bring it up with her too much. She is maybe still in denial about my atheism a little bit, and I don't want to stress her out with deep emotional arguments because she's pretty old and just too lovable. My brother, on the other hand, is a born-again fundie, and for the most part, a misogynistic, homophobic idiot. I avoid him a lot, but not just because of the religion thing. My sister is agnostic, and gay, so whenever there are family gatherings we always go together to back each other up. We are definitely not a close-knit family, but there is no real malice either.|`|FI916ISFaa	Not really.  My mother and sister believe in ghosts, psychics, messages from the beyond and all that so we try not to talk about that kinda stuff too much.  One of my brothers is a born-again fundie and it was hard when he first got religion (we were all raised moderate Catholics) to be around him and his preaching.  My mother took him aside once and told him that if he wanted to be around his family in this life he had better stop the preaching or we wouldn't want to be around him.  He no longer preaches and as a concession we let him offer the prayers before meals at family gatherings.  The only bone of contention we have with him has to do with his son.  His son is a bit effeminate and likes girly things.  As most of the rest of us are live and let live about homosexuality his (and his wife and daughter's) treatment of his son when he acts effeminate can grate on us a bit.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I just spent three months as care giver for my ailing sister, driving her 40 miles most days through Seattle traffic, making sure she survived oversights by caring doctors and nurses who occasionally dropped the ball. My brother the evangelical travels up there for a day and claims to have miraculously cured my sister's kidneys through prayer, the dumb sh*t.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	No most of my family has converted.<br>  My husbands family hasn't. And one member of his family ALWAYS brings up religion-not us. <br>  We also lost friends. My husbands best friends HATES anyone who practices any religion.  And he'll tell you that.<br>  <br>  ?|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Nope. My parents are xtian but very liberal. They don't care about that stuff.|`|YUAegpPoaa	Any tension or disagreement in my family is not based on religion; religion is occasionally drug into it for emphasis, explanation, or as an attempt to make opinion an unassailable bastion though. <br>  <br>  The last one doesn't happen too often because, in la mia famiglia, even the pious folks will cut you off at the knees for that...  along the line of "Godwin's law".|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	In earlier times, my sister and I avoided each other over the issue of faith (she is an evangelical Christian, and my family and I are Pagan), and those times when we did come together were frought with tension.  However, we've both grown up some since then.  I stopped caring what she thought and put my foot down about any evanglizing comments or snide remarks, and she has grown up a lot (getting married and having a child) and has become, if not more tolerant, at least more respectful of my right to disagree.  <br>  <br>  My wife's family has always been religiously disinterested, and accepted our faith with surpisingly little notice.  Our Companion's parents, on the other hand, were horrified, and actually tried to have her committed, or me arrested or both.  We have avoided them for the last 10 years, but the religion issue is hardly the most critical.  Her father is an abusive, domineering jerk, and our peculiar family arrangement is far more offensive to them than our faith.  The last words I had with him were in the parking lot at the airport when I promised him that any further harrassment would result in me hunting him down and taking a trophy from his body to hang on the wall of my workshop.<br>  <br>  It's sad, but true, that we can't choose our family, and when you fall in love with a person, you often inherit their familial troubles, as well.  Still, I wouldn't change anything.  My folks don't join us in our rituals, but they are fascinated, and have a pretty good base understanding now, and I suppose that process of teaching and creating broader understanding is the best we can hope for.  <br>  <br>  Excellent question!|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Division does not exist in my family.<br>  <br>  Even among the ones with degrees and or multiple degrees of education.<br>  <br>  17 siblings in my family.<br>  <br>  13 in my wife's family.<br>  <br>  All of them are family.|`|AA11987172	My husband and I had a spat about it last night.  But we have made up, and we usually just agree to disagree.  <br>  My mom is very religious and doesn't know about my lack of belief.  I don't want to upset her or worry her, I think she has enough on her plate...<br>  <br>  ;)|`|faT4MyVkaa	Relatives don't talk to me about religion, because they get frustrated when confronted with logic and facts. Also, I don't bring it up.|`|ntdhO8wsaa	No.  I'm the only atheist in my family, but nothing will ever come between my family and I.<br>  <br>  Love is more powerful than idiocy.|`|37LKDbtsaa	It doesn't divide my family, but I lost a lot of friends, when I left my religion.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	Yes. I don't avoid my parents/some siblings anymore but I used to. I find it hard to understand how smart people can be so closed minded and taken in by their church. I am still angry over the religion that as forced down my throat for so long and it pains me to know that my parents think I have friends that are going to "spiritual prison" or "outer darkness". It upsets me that their church and it's members have repeatedly taken advantage of my parents. It hurts that I won't be included in much of my parent's lives and parts of their deaths. I think what hurts the most is that I love my parents so much, I live a good and healthy life, I know I am a good person, and I try to do so much for my parents(including financially and physically helping them and listening to their woes) but they still believe I'm not good enough and I won't be going to the same heaven as they are.|`|RFLibWncaa	I avoid certain subjects with my mother because she is just plain nutty about certain things. But... I avoided those subjects when we were the same religion. She's just a little too "out there" for me. My family is incredibly diverse with regards to religion (and about everything else you can think of) and it has really never caused a problem. We only avoid one small group of people but it has more to do with the fact that they are just horrible people and less to do with them being Pentecostals. Though they did throw a fit over a Buddhist statue in the house on the day my father died when they came to visit. He was a Buddhist, he just died, deal with it..... we were not pleased.|`|YIAZmSW7aa	My parents are weak theists.  It makes my mother sad that I am an atheist but she doesn't bring it up.

A lot of them have an inbuilt hatred towards white people and they show it - THAT is where what you're calling 'racism' comes in!  I have been a white victim of racism at the hands of black people more than once, but that way round doesn't seem to matter - if I was black I could've had people sacked and compensation by now!!!

How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found? How can something of lasting significance be achieved? So many people have never stopped to consider these important questions. They look back years later and wonder why their relationships have fallen apart and why they feel so empty, even though they may have achieved what they set out to accomplish. An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport. He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there's nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.<br>  <br>  In our humanistic society, people pursue many purposes, thinking that in them they will find meaning. Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others. People have testified that while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.<br>  <br>  The author of the biblical book of Ecclesiastes states this feeling when he said, “Meaningless! Meaningless!...Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2). King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available. And he said at one point that anything that his heart wanted, he pursued. And yet he summed up “life under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless! Why is there such a void? Because God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now. Solomon said of God, “He has also set eternity in the hearts of men...” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.<br>  <br>  In Genesis, the first book of the Bible, we find that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26). This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else (any other life form). We also find that before mankind fell into sin and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: (1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18-25); (2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); (3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and (4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26). What is the significance of these things? God intended for each of these to add to our fulfillment in life, but all of these (especially man's fellowship with God) were adversely affected by man's fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).<br>  <br>  In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, God reveals that He will destroy this present earth and heavens as we know them and usher in the eternal state by creating a new heaven and a new earth. At that time, He will restore the full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, pain, etc. (Revelation 21:4), and believers will inherit all things. God will dwell with them, and they shall be His sons (Revelation 21:7). Thus, we come full circle in that God created us to have fellowship with Him, man sinned, breaking that fellowship, God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state. Now to go through life achieving anything and everything only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile! But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43), but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful. How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?<br>  <br>  MEANING OF LIFE RESTORED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST<br>  <br>  Real meaning in life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of the relationship with God that was lost at the time of Adam and Eve's fall into sin. Today, that relationship with God is only possible through His Son, Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12; John 14:6; John 1:12). Eternal life is gained when one repents of his/her sin (no longer wants to continue in it but wants Christ to change them and make them a new person) and starts relying on Jesus Christ as Savior.<br>  <br>  Real meaning in life is not found merely in finding Jesus as Savior (as wonderful as that is). Rather, real meaning in life is when one begins to follow Christ as His disciple, learning of Him, spending time with Him in His Word, the Bible, communing with Him in prayer, and in walking with Him in obedience to His commands. If you are an unbeliever (or perhaps a new believer) you might be saying to yourself, “That does not sound very exciting or fulfilling to me!” But please read on just a little longer. Jesus made the following statements:<br>  <br>  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:28-30). “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10b). “If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it” (Matthew 16:24-25). “Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).<br>  <br>  What all of these verses are saying is that we have a choice. We can continue to seek to guide our own lives, which results in an empty life, or we can choose to pursue God and His will for our lives with a whole heart, which will result in living life to the full, having the desires of our heart met, and finding contentment and satisfaction. This is so because our Creator loves us and desires the best for us (not necessarily the easiest life, but the most fulfilling).<br>  <br>  The Christian life can be compared to the choice, when attending a sporting event, of whether to purchase the expensive seats that are close to the action, or to pay less and watch the game from a distance. Watching God work “from the front row” is what we should choose, but sadly, is not what most people choose. Watching God work firsthand is for whole-hearted disciples of Christ who have truly stopped pursuing their own desires so that they can be pursuing God's purposes. They have paid the price (complete surrender to Christ and His will); they are experiencing life to its fullest; and they can face themselves, their fellow man, and their Maker with no regrets. Have you paid the price? Are you willing to? If so, you will not hunger after meaning or purpose again.|`|97ca6663adad94c1f5fa4d010bf0ce51aa	42|`|xbCGVdiOaa	What do you enjoy doing?<br>  <br>  There's your answer.|`|2SzYXPrHaa	42.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Cheese.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Jeez, if I believed in any of these answers I would just kill myself.<br>  <br>  The meaning of life here on earth is to become truly born again by the heavenly gospel of the water (not your baptism) and the Spirit (John 3:3-5). Once you do this 100% then you will become a sinless and righteous child of God by faith.<br>  <br>  Then you can only do His righteous work by remitting other peoples sins by this same gospel as a holy priest unto God, so that they too can become exactly like you and have the right to enter the kingdom of heaven and live there with God forever and ever and ever.<br>  <br>  So, if you think deeply on this issue, this life is but a passing shadow, but life eternal should be the goal.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

So if there is a girl flirting online with him they will point that out.  So he might just want to keep it a private thing to see if it works out first.   But if he is not acting different towards you don't worry about it.   Also Stop stalking his facebook page hon.  lol I know it is hard but you need to be confident about this.   If he is still flirting with you this next week be bold.  Ask him out.   It could be fun. :)  Good luck to you.
i4XDfijnaa	Yes, I do believe in life after death or rebirth, we get rewarded for good deeds done this lifetime in the next life.  Suppose a person's life is cut short by illness or accident in this life, its only fare that God reward him or her in the next life for all the good deeds that person did in this lifetime. I guess we keep on having rebirths till we became so good that we are like God.  In addition, its romantic to think that you will run into someone you had loved in this life and couldn't have him or her for some reason, that you will run into him or her again in another life with different ending.|`|SuBRC6BJaa	life before birth?|`|TXXNLDVEaa	yep heaven and hell|`|YAoSgET5aa	In my Atheistic belief i will say that it is a possibility, however i do believe that we as humans have a soul, a spirit if you will and i believe that spirit has a place to go.

Love whom you desire, for you shall eventually depart.  Do what you please, for you shall pay.  Know that the night-prayer[1]  is the honor of a believer, and his pride is being independant on others.’” (Silsilah al-Saheehah)<br>  <br>  If there is only one thing certain about life, it is that it ends.  This truism instinctively raises a question which preoccupies most people at least once in their life: What lies beyond death?<br>  <br>  At the physiological level, the journey that the deceased takes is plain for all to witness.  If left alone to natural causes,[2]  the heart will stop beating, the lungs will stop breathing, and the body’s cells will be starved of blood and oxygen.  The termination of blood flow to the outer extremities will soon turn them pale.  With the oxygen cut off, cells will respire anaerobically for a time, producing the lactic acid which causes rigor mortis – the stiffening of the corpse’s muscles.  Then, as the cells begin to decompose, the stiffness wanes, the tongue protrudes, the temperature drops, the skin discolors, the flesh rots, and the parasites have their feast - until all that is left is dried-out tooth and bone.<br>  <br>  As for the journey of the soul after death, then this is not something that can be witnessed, nor can it be gauged through scientific enquiry.  Even in a living body, the conscious, or soul, of a person cannot be subjected to empirical experimentation.  It is simply beyond human control.  In this regard, the concept of a Hereafter - a life beyond death, resurrection, and a Day of Reckoning; not to mention the existence of a Divine, Omnipotent Creator, His angels, destiny, and so on - comes under the subject of belief in the unseen.  The only way in which man can come to know anything of the unseen world is through divine revelation.<br>  <br>  “And with God are the keys of the unseen, none knows them but He.  And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it.  There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.” (Quran 6:59)|`|xB8051CUaa	yes. all d religion in d world stress this...<br>  <br>  in hinduism ,christianity and in islam after death d man has to give his accounts about he did in earth. according to his work(karma) either he wil b punished or awarded with heaven....but there is life after that heaven also..according to hinduism until he gets mukthi(slavation) though he gets heaven he wil b borning in earth.......vaikundam is final destination to all from where there is no birth to earth again...u wil b there always with god paying ur tributes to him always...its only a permanent one...|`|0rBEqVtHaa	I thut about that.

There's no more pain and suffering.<br>  <br>  Also, another thing to think about is we are a one tiny speck in this big universe and we happen to be the only life form (so it seems now). Could a chance and evolution have created you and me and every animal and plants that is on earth? That's seems like a really stupid reason...it just happened by chance...???

HmZOT6o7aa	I don't think so? Rory Emerald lives in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California. Your question reminds me of something Michael Jackson might ask. Adiós & God Bless!|`|KA4Ga5Wraa	You found a what? -- Prankster pulls one on readers with string of<br>  <br>  classified ads - By: GARY WARTH - Staff Writer | Saturday, February 23, 2008 7:44 PM PST<br>  <br>  To everybody hoping to claim Herbie the Love Bug, Rory Emerald has a simple message.<br>  <br>  Gotcha.<br>  <br>  "Calls are still coming in," Emerald said last week from his home in Los Angeles, where he works as an artist and stay-at-home dad when not pulling pranks in newspapers.<br>  <br>  One of Emerald's latest gags appeared in the North County Times on Feb. 7. There, between ads for lost dogs and found earrings, was an ad for something more unconventional: The original VW Beetle and other movie memorabilia from the 1968 film, "The Love Bug."<br>  <br>  Emerald didn't have it. Never did. He also doesn't have the car from "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," John Lennon's personal diary or the original dinner menu from the Titanic.<br>  <br>  In newspapers around the country, however, Emerald has claimed to have found all those things and more. Since 2005, he has been pulling the nation's collective leg with claims to have found the oddest of items, beginning with a prosthetic nose he said he discovered near Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch.<br>  <br>  "I didn't think anything of it," he said about the joke ad he put in the Santa Barbara News-Press. Emerald said he placed the ad at the height of Jackson's 2005 child-molestation trial because he was tired of the endless courtroom coverage and wanted to add some levity.<br>  <br>  "I took my daughter to school and came back home, and the phone was going mad," he said.<br>  <br>  Radio stations also called about the wayward nose, and Emerald quickly let on that it was all a gag.<br>  <br>  Rather than feeling as if they had been gulled, people instead asked Emerald whether he planned to do more. He happily obliged.<br>  <br>  "I said I found a baby panda walking around the San Diego Zoo," he said about his next ad, which was in the Union-Tribune.<br>  <br>  The ad was taken more seriously than he expected, and Emerald said he received a call from the Chinese consulate, who had to be convinced that Emerald was joking about having found one of the animals on loan from China.<br>  <br>  "Once they realized it, they thought it was funny," Emerald said.<br>  <br>  At 41, Emerald still is having fun with the prank ads, which number between 60 and 70. In one of his favorites, Emerald claimed to have found a healthy, adorable kitten. With two heads.<br>  <br>  "A lot of people wanted it," he said. "That ad brought out the best and worst in everybody. Some people would call and say they really had it and had lost it. I knew they were lying, because I had made it up."<br>  <br>  Emerald said some celebrities ---- he won't say who ---- called and tried to impress him with their name and their money, but were turned away.<br>  <br>  "I'd say, 'No, she's not for sale, and you can't have her for any amount of money,'" he said.<br>  <br>  Turning the tables <br>  This isn't the first time Emerald has been associated with something bizarre in newspapers. In 1990, when he was 23, tabloid writers who had noticed him frequently Hollywood parties claimed he was engaged to Elizabeth Taylor, 58. Emeald appeared on "Entertainment tonight" to clear things up.<br>  <br>  He had an another uncomfortable brush with celebrity in 1993 with a stunt that dramatically backfired. While shopping on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Emerald decided to tell the salesclerk he was Mia Farrow's personal shopper. He selected about $10,000 in merchandise, signed for it, walked out and was promptly arrested by officers who had been called by the clerk.<br>  <br>  Emerald still insists that he intended to send the clothes to Farrow, who he said was dressing appallingly.<br>  <br>  "I kept seeing her in different things and I couldn't stand what she was wearing," Emerald said. "I was going to give her the clothes and send her the bill."<br>  <br>  His story didn't fly in court, and he spent five months in jail.<br>  <br>  "I don't know what I was thinking," he said.<br>  <br>  On the plus side, Emerald said, Farrow did begin to dress better after the incident.<br>  <br>  The art of prank ads <br>  Fine-tuning the pranks has become a craft for Emerald, who also creates abstract art at home and sometimes sells lithographs of his work.<br>  <br>  Emerald first thinks of an unusual but somewhat-believable item to feature, then runs an announcement in a daily newspaper that offers free lost and found ads.<br>  <br>  An ad in Fargo claimed he had found Elvis' original tour bus, and an ad in Iowa City claim to be for the original car in "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."<br>  <br>  In Monterey, Emerald said he found Doris Day's pearl necklace and all the pillows from her movie, "Pillow Talk." In Santa Rosa, he ran an ad claiming he had Tom Cruise's heart-shaped bed and Lhasa Apso.<br>  <br>  In Fresno, Emerald claimed he found Judy Garland's original ruby slippers from "The Wizard of Oz." Responses included one from a woman claiming to be Dorothy, wanting her shoes back.<br>  <br>  One ad claimed to be for Babe Ruth's original bat and glove, another for the genie bottle from "I Dream of Jeannie."

lTDeZ0Obaa	1- What do you consider yourself? <br>  <br>  2 - To be truly American you should apply for citizenship, take the test, become a citizen. THEN, you would be considered an American!<br>  <br>  EDIT ~ I do not know why this is such an issue for some people. This country is made up of all different people. Yes, you can become a citizen of the country without having been born here, giving you all the rights and responsibilities of any other natural born American citizen (except the ability to be President). Our country was founded on immigrants! You would (as Justin stated) be an American, but you would still be ethnically Indian. But, without having your citizenship most people would not consider you to be truly American, no matter how long you live here. And, there are certain things you are unable to participate in and take advantage of by not being a citizen, such as voting in elections. It can be a complex issue.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Not until you are an American citizen!|`|HlgSu0ZJaa	The term "American" is somewhat misused.  People in the North, South, and Central.  Could still be called American but they would rather choose not to.  But referring to the US then you would have to be a citizen I guess.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	You would be considered an American if you've gained American citizenship. However, your ethnicity would still be Indian.|`|XuG5g9Zgaa	Only if you were born in America and/or had legal citizenship would you be considered an American.|`|3fds8d3eaa	no your heart and you are still in your home country|`|ISHIDwawaa	there is no technical definition on how american someone is. I'd say in my view that you are more american than Indian as you've lived here longer, but this would also have to factor in your culture. There are many ethnic groups in america that maintain their cultural identity and therefore may not be  viewed as american by the standard americans. There are also some american born and raised people that are viewed as un-american because their culture is different than others. <br>  <br>  Essentially, if you speak the language of your region in the US with no accent, and fit in the american culture just like a typical american i'd say you are american. <br>  <br>  I am white, born and raised in this country yet some may culturally identify me as non american when it comes to my food selections (i am a vegan, and i eat more indian, japanese, meditrainian food than any american food),but you'd also never see me drive a foreign car. <br>  <br>  Another factor we must look at is, american is essentially the mixing of world cultures together, and you are part of the melting pot so you are american.|`|gHCSkzkRaa	i would say that you are more or less amercanized rather than american...calling yourself american is implying that you are native to this country...kind of like if i lived ten years in new york city, then fifteen on a reservation in oklahoma, i wouldn't call myself a native american, that would insult the tribe...|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	Absolutely not. You have to become a naturalized citizen before you'll ever be considered an American citizen. If you've really been here that long why wouldn't you have taken the test and completed all the paper work?|`|RnouDC55aa	are you gay? indians boys are hawwwtt! <br>  <br>  I can make you a US citizen by marrying you into the country! come to Massachusetts! lol|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Are you an American citizen?

Getting citizenship means that you are a American. But you can consider yourself american if you want xD|`|B1mjjNNKaa	No! you're Indian because you grew up there and so did you're family (i guess) so no you're not an American though some people might consider you as an American (like another Americans)|`|OpoETyfoaa	if u are in the U.S for more than 14 years you are concidered an american. so yes u are an american now. your nationality is indian|`|38ab6659a0292a00b09330a5fca5c2deaa	No you have to go through a naturalization process and a lot of government paperwork to be an american|`|kA4umuYfaa	Not until you become an American citizen and take the test for it.|`|65orPuo6aa	I agree with the 1st answer. ;)<br>  If your a legal citizen.|`|ZM93vzxpaa	if your pet was born a dog, always going to be a dog|`|4xt5SL58aa	no|`|GkcX95QNaa	Yes,if you were born in the U.S.|`|R3yUkaCSaa	if u are a u.s citizen then yeah.
L8iI0Ocraa	No. You have to at least be baptized to enter heaven in the Catholic religion. Look at Jesus. He was only baptized. He did create the Eucharist but it says nothing about confirmation. I know he's the son of God and all but I'm just using him as an example.|`|okxbEiRVaa	the gift of jesus salvation in free<br>  <br>  dont listen to these atheist they are against GOd and anything against GOD is from satan<br>  <br>  so there the devil themselves<br>  <br>  you like my logic =] <br>  <br>  all you have to do i repent thats all it takes to get into heaven<br>  <br>  say jesus <br>  <br>  you died for me, for my sin<br>  <br>  i am a sinning i ask you forgive me and you come into my heart<br>  and make me new again.<br>  <br>  thats it .<br>  <br>  dont sin it will drift you from GOD say this everytime you sin and you shall inherit the kingdom.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Confirmation is necessary for ongoing life in the Church, however it is not a requirement of salvation for a Catholic. But the issue is why would you not be confirmed? It is not a hard process.|`|wPNtVytKaa	If  you have accepted Jesus as your savior, you won't go to hell.<br>  Other than that, you'll have to take it up with God on your coming up one-to-one day.|`|01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	Um, you cannot get married in a Catholic Church, but besides that I have no idea... there is only one way to heaven... and that has nothing to do with being confirmed!|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	OK....well I suppose thats up to God now isnt it?|`|zyyH2aX2aa	How would anyone on here know?  No one on this service has died before...|`|GEfUTyi8aa	NO..... there is no hell.... stop condemning people....... its frightening...!!!!|`|yQNit56Qaa	So let me get this straight:  you're asking if all Roman Catholics who die before the age of - oh, let's say 12 - go to Hell?<br>  <br>  You don't know the answer?<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|XsTJPMHqaa	You are passing up a chance at Grace, and you cannot recieve many more of the Sacraments because you are not fully initiated into The Church. I would encourage you to recieve this Sacrament, as it will help further your love and devotion to God, and open you up to recieve Sanctifying Grace, as well as being more attuned to Actual Graces.<br>  <br>  However, Catholics do not make judgements about whether or not people are being sent to hell. We are not God, so we do not know.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Confirmation is not essential to salvation according to the Church.<br>  <br>  If a person is purposely refraining from receiving the sacrament of Confirmation in order to defy Church tradition,  that is a different matter.<br>  I think any such person should reflect on why he or she is refraining from receiving this sacrament.  The sacrament of Confirmation is part of the ordinary process of entering into full communion with the Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  I think you should read the Catechism of The Catholic Church to learn more about this.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church is available from Amazon.com for less than twenty U.S. dollars.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Ordinarily, if you have not received this sacrament,  you may not serve as a Godparent in the Catholic Church.  In rare cases, I believe a Bishop has the authority to grant an exception,  but that would be very unlikely.   It is not necessary to have received this sacrament in order to be married in the Catholic Church.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I do not have the actual answer to that. I have starred it because I believe one of my contacts may have the actual answer. (The real Catholic response and not the fundamentalist response.)|`|pMDY89KQaa	yup sorry you are doomed. be miserable forever because your life has no meaning and new life will just begin with flames.<br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  dont listen to the christians....|`|VsCrYYMeaa	No
TpVE6ci6aa	I won't correct this fully because it looks like homework, but I'll give a few tips.<br>  <br>  1. You only use "bist" when you are saying "you are" informally. When talking about singular objects (like Reise) you use "ist" and with plural objects (such as Ferien) you use "sind". Bist is present tense.<br>  <br>  2. Place names don't usually change in translation, so you would leave "Big Bear Berg" as "Big Bear Mountain".<br>  <br>  3. "Dort sind nicht Sonntagschule gewesen." Is this meant to mean "There weren't any Sunday schools there"? To say "there are" or "there is" in German, you use the construction "Es gibt" (literally "it gives"), so this would be written as "Dort hat es keine Sonntagschulen gegeben"<br>  <br>  4. In phrases like these: "Dann, wir haben" and "Am Sonntag wir besichtigten". The verb usually comes second in a German sentence, but in these they're in the third place (phrases like "Am Sonntag" count as one piece), so they should be written as "Dann, haben wir" and "Am Sonntag, besichtigten wir"<br>  <br>  5. Some of it isn't in the present perfect tense, such as "besichtigten" which is in the imperfect tense. The present perfect tense always involves either the word "to be" or "to have".<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

mGfCY4Ytaa	i think this is a misconception. i love sex! and my girlfriend does too. here's whats really going on: everyone has a gender role stereotype that they are supposed to fit into. men are supposed to be tough, aggressive, and horny. women are supposed to be shy and modest and definitely not show interest in sex. this is why when a guy sleeps with a lot of people he is a "player" and its seen as positive but when a woman does the same thing she is seen as a "slut" and its a negative thing. but we know that these gender roles dont always apply to everyone. men aren't always aggressive and women aren't always shy. but we are expected to be by societal norms. <br>  <br>  Therefore, women often say they think sex is nasty because they are expected to think that in order to be a "lady" but they really dont think it at all.<br>  <br>  as for your other question. there are four times as many nerve endings in the clitoris than in the penis, so if a woman is stimulated in the right way, then it is quite possibly that sex is better for women than it is for men!|`|gFqeMs22aa	a lot of it comes from the way they've been indoctrinated by society. some religions see sex as a big taboo and that has also influenced people's attitude.<br>  <br>  girls are also taught that sweating is disgusting and in sex there's major sweating...

9hGKMt8jaa	The story is set circa 1790 in the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, New York, in a secluded glen called Sleepy Hollow. It tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky, and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who competes with Abraham "Brom Bones" Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and sole child of a wealthy farmer, Baltus Van Tassel. As Crane leaves a party he attended at the Van Tassel home on an autumn night, he is pursued by the Headless Horseman, who is supposedly the ghost of a Hessian trooper who had his head shot off by a stray cannonball during "some nameless battle" of the American Revolutionary War, and who "rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head". Ichabod mysteriously disappears from town, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones, who was "to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related".|`|NjEowRpLaa	I do.

5ofS2qQYaa	we improve our condition b/c we don't know where we will be placed in the hereafter<br>  it's very much inline w/human nature: uncertainty in the future, so prepare yourself now<br>  why do we strive for grades in school? b/c we don't know what'll happen, but we'd like to be in a good place in the future...we'd like to get into college, get a steady job...be happy...but we aren't 100% certain any of that will happen, so we do the best we can now<br>  we aren't 100% sure we'll get admitted to heaven straight away if at all, so we do the best we can now <br>  Society improves/advances on this basis...do what you can do now so that our future seems more secure and appealing in our eyes<br>  this is a fact based on acquired common sense<br>  <br>  this is not a religious question...it's more of a question of how you see things...a perception question that doesn't really pertain to religion b/c in every progressive human's view, we all do the same:<br>  do what you can now, in order to grasp the intangible notion that our future is secure<br>  <br>  very much human nature, sir<br>  -----------<br>  psychology now: <br>  "wouldn't then what you do be out of selfish reasons and to achieve selfish ends?"<br>  yes, I am only good so that I can get into heaven...being good entails being selfless, I do it for my self. <br>  <br>  Every Human is selfish in some way or form, even if it's only a speck of selfishness, it's there. Selfishness is required for society to function. No one can live a life for someone else.<br>  Even in the case of love when others would say something to that extent, it's selfish b/c they are saying that only b/c they get some kind of contentment in it themselves....self-centered thinking translated into more socially acceptable forms (despite that this kind of thinking is actually not acceptable, agreed? extremes in emotions...)<br>  <br>  Altruism -> along the same lines...we do something for others b/c we know in the end it'll come back to us in some form, and we'd like that form to be pleasant.<br>  b/c humans are aware that we will all eventually die, we have a part of us in our children left behind, so that is another form of selfishness when we want something for ourselves, but can't have it (b/c we'd be dead)...so we want it for some alternate version of us (our future generations)<br>  <br>  Altruism is a very interesting topic, do look into it if you are looking to learn and not just for an argument.<br>  <br>  "if you do something out of fear then where is the good in that"<br>  uncertainty of the future does not always translate to fear of the future<br>  it can just as easily become indifference or love<br>  <br>  nonetheless, there is a concept of fear and love together for Allah(swt) --God-- in Islam, known as Taqwa...basically being conscious of the All-Mighty Creator<br>  and our intentions should be for Him(swt)<br>  <br>  "how true are your intentions"<br>  idk..this is broad...would you like to specify intentions for what/whom?<br>  I should be striving to make all my intentions are for Allah(swt), but I admit sometimes I see them only for myself or others...etc.<br>  <br>  you're deviating from the topic...open another question:<br>  "how true are your intentions if they are out of fear/love..etc."<br>  I think this is an interesting topic as well<br>  ----<br>  "yet it seems when one acts altruisticly out of fear of punishment (ie hell) the selfishness is more explicit..."<br>  I think I can agree with that<br>  I believe that's why most people act altruistically out of love of reward (ie heaven).... both concepts are commonly incorporated simultaneously, but great rewards have usually been more prone to stimulate action...<br>  ex: contests are entered by people who want the prize...a rewarding stimulus<br>  actually they're both potentially lead to some sort of action, it really depends on the individual's receptiveness and degree of punishment/reward<br>  ex: nazi officials carrying out duties for fear of their own lives<br>  <br>  you can look into the reward/punishment system in education for a great example of how teachers try to impart information while encouraging or discouraging behavior<br>  <br>  "still, happyness that results from the well being of others seems better than happyness from knowing that what you did will be rewarded materially later on"<br>  of course it seems better...in a perfect world, isn't that how it would be? nonetheless, we have rewards and punishments coming to us whether we think about them everyday or not...<br>  they are not always material (in fact, Islam emphasizes divergence from that thought of "material reward"), but rather they can be spiritual, mental, emotional, etc..<br>  and not everyone has immediate consequences on their minds...people hardly associate action w/consequence before performing such actions...actions become inherent, thus the concept of consequences isn't always on the surface of our minds, as humans of all race/religions<br>  -----<br>  "religion continues to treat humans as children into adulthood by threatening naughty behavior with hell and rewarding good with heaven."<br>  not necessarily religion. Society continues to treat humans as children, by your logic, by threatening naughty behavior with something like being fired from work and rewarding good behavior with something like a raise/promotion<br>  the concept of reward + punishment didn't come from religion. it came from human nature...and psychologists analyzed it and conceptualized it in order to understand what's going on. their conclusions were generally that humans respond to various levels of reward + punishment all throughout life....action and consequences...it's a lifelong human -nature thing<br>  your struggle to overlook the facts of psychology and society in order to tie in religion is disappointing b/c I thought you understood...it's not just religion, it's life<br>  in every thing you do, I do, an atheist may do, there is reward/punishment as a consequence no matter how big or how small.<br>  <br>  "nazis is a perfect illustration of the mechanization of morality in religion."<br>  the nazis clearly had no religion, unless worship to hitler is what you'd like to consider religion. again, this is mechanization of morality in society, not religion<br>  in nearly every religion, morality is supposedly an active form of living, but through society, this active form becomes mechanized and dormant b/c we become more concerned w/worldly + materialistic results rather than non-tangible results later on. <br>  <br>  "good and bad are are defined by what god determines to be holy ( and not what we have concluded to be moral as a society)"<br>  before the concept of God was ever officially recorded and recognized, good and bad had already been defined through experience (ex: caveman touches fire = bad, caveman cooks w/fire = good) Good and Bad as a result is not only what God determines to be holy, but how society will perceive situations and people based on previous experiences and knowledge. we've got God-given rationality and morality embedded in us, we just need to brush off the dust and put it into use more actively...<br>  the idea of "holy" = good is something people learn from the enormous emphasis of the church in one's life<br>  Islam isn't about {"holy" this or "holy", making people follow w/o question}. It's about {practicality and rationality} which each individual is responsible for using and for always striving to learn and understand more w/such in mind. <br>  <br>  "we obey them like robots, same with the nazi soldiers, so it is no longer morality but dogma"<br>  yes, in some religions, in some societies...but every human has the capability to break free if they strive to learn the truth for themselves. the thing about dogma in most religions is that they don't want you to learn...how many religions put any emphasis into educating yourselves? <br>  I see only Islam began w/the most basic commandment: "READ" and continued to equalize the opportunities for both men and women making learning an responsibility for every one, so that there are no mindless actions. nearly everything in the Qur'an has proof in some way or form....other things are common sense, and the rest is a small portion of what's called "faith"...what we can't completely prove, but everything leads to it. <br>  Like raising a child...if raised well, we believe, we have faith in the fact that he/she will grow to be good...this is faith, everything leads to it, but we cannot come close to proving that it must be so...not until it happens<br>  in the case of Islam, not until the Day of Judgment and hereafter<br>  <br>  "my point is: living for the afterlife cause each person to live life in a state of fear and paranoia, each worrying about saving their @ss from the toments of hell"<br>  my point is: not everyone lives in fear and paranoia and I think you're trying to disregard everything i've said before<br>  every person is different and unknown does NOT always equal fear/paranoia...read again if you skimmed<br>  I'm not constantly worrying about saving my *** from hell b/c I cannot come close to imaging something that bad..rather I'm worrying about getting into heaven cuz alhamdulilah, I've experienced lots of happy moments in my life and I can only think of how much greater and multiplied those feelings may be in heaven...<br>  those who've experienced more tough times might be more driven to run away from hell...or they may be even more driven to taste heaven<br>  every person is different based on whether they see things optimistically or pessimistically<br>  <br>  "self centerred mentality"<br>  what'd I say? we're all self-centered as human beings in some way or form<br>  <br>  "where we are no longer interested in improving this world and our societies and institutions"<br>  idk about you, but b/c I care for myself, I ca|`|H8WqMK1eaa	We should always want to leave the world a better place for our children and grandchildren and their children.

So God is not particular on what religion you join... The important thing is you believe and in believing you are happy doing His Will.|`|idRvGHOEaa	I know where you are going with this and I know what faith you belong to. But it is pointless to confirm to something you couldn't wholeheartedly believe in. Why would anyone want someone in their church that disagrees with some of it's teachings. Look at Nancy Pelosi and Joseph Biden. I see countless Catholics on here saying that they should leave the church. So, what I am guessing is that it is impossible to be Catholic and disagree with some teachings of Catholicism. In order to partake of Holy Communion, one must be a Catholic in good standing with the church, confirming to ALL that the church teaches. So that means, if you disagree with anything, you can't partake of this sacrament. There is no good reason to place yourself in something that you can't wholeheartedly believe in. You will only be living a very depressing, unhealthy, and unfulfilling life. If you can't believe in the teachings of Catholicism with all your heart and mind (such as myself), then that just isn't where the Holy Spirit may be leading you to. Please think of it from this perspective when you think of non-Catholic Christians. For those that do find peace and joy in Catholicism (such as you I assume), God Bless You. Peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.|`|rCF8UtNTaa	Read romans ch 1-2.  Man "invents" god after his own image.

Let's see if I understand what it is you want the humans to reach this new "home" to be like.<br>  Without a democratic system of government there would be a ruling class and a subordinate class. This has been proved over and over again.You can call it autocratic, monarchical or dictatorship whatever you want.It will happen over many generations.This has been proven not only macroscopically but in the lab too.Take 20 students and give 10 of them power as "guards " over 10 that are "prisoners" and their personality changes to fit the role and they act accordingly.<br>  Capitalism and religion provide choice to people. They don't feel helpless about their circumstances. They have hope.Freedom of choice is the most basic tenet of our society and what keeps our system thriving with different viewpoints and discussion. Any other system dulls the mind. By the time we get to the other planet are we going to be better as humans or revert to our baser instincts?<br>  Let me present a bigger problem. You leave earth on a spaceship  at near light speed. With time dilation in effect thousands of years would pass here on earth. By that time they will have developed warp drive or wormholes or God knows what. They will get there before we do. And probably have a party in our honor to welcome people from such an ancient civilization.|`|o35cQe3Iaa	I sure hope not.  If I was on that ship, I would want to be a free person and not want to be told what to do.  I would personally like to choose my job, then have someone force me to do something.  What's the purpose of living if you're life is being controlled by someone else?  It's like slavery, when you really think about it.  As Patrick Henry once put it, "Give me liberty, or give me death."  As for religion, I believe faith is what drives us in life and I sure hope there would be some faith on that ship, especially in a dangerous situation, like an asteroid field.  Why can't it be just like the greatest country in the whole universe; USA.  Why?  Because we tell the government what to do.  Besides, it would be more efficient with a capitalist type of society, because there is more competition, and people would be happy and free to do what they want on the ship while they are still helping their society by doing something they like and are good at.  A socialist, communist, or dictatorship would just lead to mutiny.

GBKaftrJaa	Jesus' death on the cross was to relieve us of having to provide the burnt offerings. Also the bible is very clear that burnt offerings can only be done at his temple by a Levite priest.  So burnt offerings done in any other way are against his rules.<br>  <br>  If you want to offer something to God, the next time you cook a very nice steak, not a sub par one, wave it around in the air to him like he told Aaron to do and pray that he enjoys it and that you will eat it in his honor if he will accept that as a gift.

irQMy4Ciaa	If you truly love her and truly care for her then it shouldn't matter that she already has a child. She is being honest with you and you need to respect her for that which like you said you do and thats good. I don't think you should throw this chance away though just because she has been in a previous marrige and has a child. Unless you truly do feel like you don't connnect with her. Personally..call her!|`|o38i8ba3aa	You two are in different places in your lives.  Even though you are both essentially starting your lives, the paths you're taking are different.  If she doesn't get the hint on her own, then you just need to let her know where you are in your life.|`|zQq7AhQCaa	Sure, but i'd let her know from the start that your not going to get into any kind of a serious relationship.|`|AA12167923	I have read your post and there is one thing that bothers me - which is her remark about looking for "a boyfriend that can care for me".  Does she really mean "take care of her".  She has a child and that part is OK - but the fact that she later sent a text saying "you'll like my baby boy", along with a picture, concerns me.  I am female and my brother fell into the trap of a woman who was looking for someone to take care of her and her child.  I am a very independent woman and can read other women.  This particular woman that my brother ended up with just went from one man to another, looking for someone to take care of her and her child.  She almost destroyed my brother and when he ran out of resources, just moved on.  Be careful! <br>  <br>  The fact that a woman has a child and is alone shouldn't be a detriment to a relationship and a woman who really cares about her child would be more concerned about the kind of man that she introduced into her child's life than whether or not the man cared if she had a child and not the other way around - at least for a mature, confident woman - and would you want any other kind?  It's a package deal, period.  And if you are seeing red flags, listen to your instincts.<br>  <br>  By the way, is her son with her and if not, why not?  And why didn't you know right away?  From your post it doesn't sound as if you knew that she had a child in the beginning.<br>  <br>  And my answer is no, do yourself and her a favour - don't call her.|`|IuUc90a3aa	Honesty is hard knocks, because when you are honest, you have to deal with the other persons reaction to your words. However, it is the right thing to do, and actually easier in the end, because it will hurt her less, and you may be able to salvage the friendship that you want. If she goes all "fatal attraction" on you the ditch her and make a clen break, but give her the chance, she may be mature and able to rise above the rejection and be the friend you want.|`|1kJgH91Jaa	Hm. tough situation.<br>  Is she still in college? Well, if she is, her college is most likely to be free.(i know someone in this situation - college student with a baby). So, personally - I would be there for support. Tell her that you don't want a relationship, but still want to be friends.<br>  <br>  She's gonna have a hell of a time with that baby - and she's gonna need all the support in the world.|`|93H9KLgCaa	you definatley need to talk with her about this.<br>  the only way for her to understand is if you give her all of your concerns. make up your mind before you talk and stick with that solution.<br>  in my opinion shes probably pushing you wayyy too far. a pushy girl is kind of a turn off<br>  <br>  am i right? yeahhh.so if i were you i think it would be best to tell her the truth as fast as you possibly can. thats the best wayy.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|tNSvBUNeaa	just tell her how you feel so your idea of what you want the friendship to be is out in the open, then see how she reacts. if she stays around she's in it for the friendship, if she dissapears then she was in it to win it & your better off without her around.|`|ePpCKNT6aa	if you want to call her, go for it.

I am a single mom and know her type. It will be nothing but drama for you. Let her find a new man who can take care of her and her baby boy- she will not let you be a friend with benefits no matter what she tells you. You want to talk to her because you are a guy who is attracted to someone who won't say no. Trust me other girls will hang out with you. If you want to be husband number two and a new daddy- call her otherwise- stay clear|`|5cee6c0b13ca0c1bf769b381888cab16aa	well you can look at this 2 ways, she should have been honest from the beginning about her child, divorce, at first, but then again, she might have wanted you to get to know her first, who knows, but if you like her, it could all be worth it~ or not lol|`|yDP9xHNnaa	Dude, she is looking for more than some one to chill with.  If you do care at all about her you have to man up and tell her that you are not looking for the same thing she is.|`|jTjhDmdxaa	if you love her stay with her.... don't give up on her. if you feel strongly about her you should help her out with her little baby boy. im sure she'd really love that. go ahead. call her.|`|pe3afDUvaa	talk to her about it. be honest. if you liked her before whats wrong now? so what she has a kid if you still respect her, sounds like you still like her.|`|U1TjqCVhaa	yeah, call her back dude but be honest to her about how you really feel...|`|nwsgLAN5aa	Before you give her the wrong impression (which you may already have!), let her know that you think you guys should just be friends, there's plenty of lines for that:<br>  -I'm not ready to commit to anything right now<br>  -Lets not complicate things, I like just hanging out with you<br>  -This semester is keeping me really busy, I don't think I can manage school and a girlfriend right now<br>  -I would like to have something more with you, but its just not the right time (this one is just putting it off for later...lol)<br>  -I'm kind of seeing someone, I'm sorry.  Can we still hang out though? <br>  <br>  I don't blame you for not wanting to get into it with her.  a baby can really complicate things and if you're a student, you should just focus on school.  I'm also a university student, I don't even date. no time! lol<br>  Anyway.. hope this helps!|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Make that very clear and don't kiss her or hold her hand or anything anymore. But still call her often and be her friend.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Keep out of her bed.  If you don't want a "marriage" type relationship get out of it altogether.  She has told you she wants someone to take care of her, and that means her child also.  She is on the hunt, if you don't want to be her prey, and the one supporting a ready-made family, then you ought to move on and let her move on.   This is trouble if you think you can just be casual friends and doing the horizontal mambo with this woman.  Check and see IF there are divorce papers as well, I doubt it.

May Allah (swt) forgive us all =)|`|00hXp6gsaa	I don't know why anyone should be ashamed because Allah already knows what you want to ask, but he won't answer it not until you ask. Also, If you ask Allah for forgiveness, for a horrible sin you have done, and you did it again the next time, that sin will stay there forever. It won't make sense, because you actually sat there and made dua just for Allah to forgive you and you do it again? That just won't make sense. Don't let Shaytan take over you, have control of your own body. I'm not saying you did anything, cz how should i know what you did, you didn't even tell us. Well you shouldn't feel ashamed, the only time you should feel ashamed is when you ask Allah for forgiveness, for a sin you did, and you did it again. When you do it again, that's what you should be ashmed for.|`|4gZv89qhaa	yeah i've been through that, espically when u do a mistake so many times and u keep doing dua for allah and promising him that you'll stop doing it.<br>  <br>  But the good news is allah will ALWAYS forgive you if you really admit your sins and felt bad about them. Allah is generous|`|nsbWaiW0aa	no, cause he already knows what i did. plus, he probably already knows when i want something, and when i do a sin, i ask for forgiveness.|`|5MFBoWSAaa	I feel like that sometimes.. but then again he already knows everything.|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	i don't think you should be just ask to forgiveness and do commit that sin again ..

NR3YnkVPaa	Of course! Everything is about sex. Why do they call a guy who is sexually aggressive a "wolf"? He stalks her at night in the forest. Sounds like the stuff I read in the LA Times. Of course it has to be indirect because it is ostensibly for children, but how many pop songs do you know that appear on the surface to be about one thing, when  everyone knows that they are really about sex or drugs etc.? Why is she wearing red? What is that associated with?  Most people didn't wear that color back in the good old days (for several reasons, but one was the "scarlet woman" image from the bible). The "goodies" that the wolf was after wasn't in her basket (well, not in that basket she was carrying on her arm).|`|FwJLD1uDaa	how? hahaha no!|`|eYwzlsk4aa	no, it's about curiosity, knowing who to trust, and knowing the right path from the wrong one. <br>  <br>  but i don't blame you for asking this, many scholars do believe the original tale as something sexual, you can read it here if you like, <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_riding_hood#Interpretations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_...</a>|`|QvF8dR7Taa	most of those tales were to frighten little kids into obeying there elders,but they all have some grain of truth in them,but as far as sex in little red riding hood,not shure.but when she ask the wolf if he was gonna eat her whole,he said no i am going to spit that part out.|`|dcISbhGyaa	Probably the original was intended to be about the wolf guy having intercourse with the little girl and the granny but then they probably edited or something|`|NjEowRpLaa	Ha ha ha I dont think it is at all.

tUaAmXvsaa	A cousin of mine came out at the age of 21.  He then told his mother that he knew he was different from the age of 4.  No he was not sexually active at 4 but he knew he was different to other boys.  He is much happier now although he has a long road ahead of him in terms of accepting certain things and to be accepted by certain people.  Prejudice is always an issue for gay people.  When you know what sexual orientation you are you will then know what you should do.  Good luck.|`|lCvJHS13aa	I guess you could also ask<br>  <br>  "Can one be to young to know whether or not they are straight"?<br>  <br>  I think until anyone has had a chance to really understand what it mean to be either "gay' or "straight", they interact with all types of people in society, at least through the ages of puberty, you won't fully know.<br>  <br>  Once there, one would be able to emotionally be ready to choose sexual preference, many will look back and realize they knew it many years before.|`|XuhQS9wsaa	No I don't think so. I started experimenting probably at age 8. I didn't know but I definitely knew I liked it. I didn't really realize it was a possibility and just thought everyone was doing this with their friends while at sleep overs. But some kids on here seem to be pretty aware of it... which is pretty cool that the age of acceptance is getting lower.|`|diCASlUXaa	Well most people don't even think about romance until close to puberty.    <br>  <br>  But sure, children can know if they are gay depending on how they feel.|`|vnS49GRSaa	If those who are gay are that way as a normal feeling within themselves, it should not even be questioned wether you are or not.  Simply stated, if you have to question if you are gay or not then you are not gay......just maybe hoping you were.  Homosexual feelings, I've been told, are as natural in gay people as heterosexual feelings are in straight people.|`|TVUstrw0aa	well I only started thinking that I might be gay when I was 14, but that's only because of the environment I had as a child.... no homosexuality yet no homophoic influences either.... so who knows<br>  So I think your home has a big effect<br>  I might even just be going through a phase right now<br>  Sincerely,<br>  Bi Kid<br>  <br>  all I know is that time will tell! :D|`|9rsEHZMNaa	it depends... some people knew they were different(or even gay) when they are very young (5) but it takes most people a while to find out.. by 15 what sex you are attracted to probably wont change... people just say its a phase b/c no1 really wants to be gay.. (no offense im gay).. but ya.... good luck|`|aYqCb3olaa	i knew i liked men and women when i was 12,<br>  so idk, being too young has nothing to do with it.<br>  It's just what they do when they're that age which could be wrong.|`|d3A83djHaa	People are born gay or straight, so I would say about 1 hour old.  If you mean when they realize what it means to be gay, then I would say around 10 or 11.|`|R1FjOFkUaa	No, I don't think that there's a such thing as too young to be gay.

I knew I was different by age 7!|`|DIj072Sqaa	It's an individual thing, I know some people who insist that their sexuality was clear to them since they were a young child and others in their 40s+ who still have issues. I personally came out as gay in my early 20s and my older brother just says 'he was never in' - I don't know the full details but he was certainly in some sort of relationship by the time he was 14 but that was also before I was born so I don't know the accurate details (he's 27 years older than me).

mOWyzwubaa	It is interesting to know that dogs are mentioned in the Quran 5 times, not just once, 7:176, 18:18, 18:22 (three times). NO WHERE does God call the dogs dirty animals or give any indication that they should be avoided or treated the way many Muslims think they should. Actually the story of the people of the cave, in Sura 18, gives the indication. that we should appreciate. <br>  <br>  The people of the cave, 3, 5 or 7 were mentioned in the Quran and every time God insists on letting us know that their dog was there with them. Their story can be as complete without the mention of the dog, but God did, Why ?|`|faNLFzwmaa	They lick each others behinds. That is one reason I can think of.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's not bad.

(Reported by Muslim, no. 418)"<br>  <br>  you can put it in an insulated dog house in the winter<br>  w/e you do, take care of your animals!<br>  ----<br>  ah, are ALL urdu-speaking moms like that?<br>  lol, same situation...mom said "no"<br>  i came to think it was in the Qur'an...never read for complete comprehension (not yet, but very soon insha'Allah)<br>  I found out though, that dogs are mentioned, but not in prohibiting or encouraging...this was decided through hadiths which are acts/sayings of the Prophet(sws) like that read above<br>  and since the Qur'an says to follow the Prophet(sws), we should follow his sayings<br>  read the links below, they'll tell you about the angels and losing good deeds and stuff<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|U5zcbHuZaa	If the Prophet said that you should wash a cup seven times if a dog licks it, that clearly indicates dogs are allowed to be in your household.<br>  <br>  How else would they be able to do that and why else would the Prophet say that?<br>  <br>  Do some research to verify. Dogs have naturally-occurring anti-biotics in their mouths. If you are exposed to saliva of dog, it is like being exposed to any other anti-biotic which means it will raise your tolerance to anti-biotics so when you need them for a real cut they will not be as effective. If you do get a cut and don't happen to have modern medicine around for anti-biotic, but there is a friendly dog available, have a dog lick it. That is science that does not go against Allah or Qur'an or even the hadith about washing the cup 7 times, it actually supports that as authenitc hadith if you understand the reason behind it, but clearly the hadith indicates you may have dogs in your household.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	I'm not muslim but dogs ,to me, are cleaner than most humans.They are your best friend and you will love them more than you can imagine.God made all things and some are not to be eaten but all can be loved.Please respect your parents wishes. GOOD LUCK.|`|AA12133859	the only thing haram about keeping a dog is not training the appropirately.  and do all shias accept dogs as pets, in Iraq they are considered dirty.|`|nsbWaiW0aa	no, the only reason you can have a dog is to use it for guarding the house.|`|aiGog438aa	Is having a dog really worth disobeying your mom?|`|Fv43CHVSaa	you can keep it in the garden :))|`|5vA7kkeyaa	It is not bad|`|xTRMSm7yaa	cause it will remind you of Mu'awiyah|`|vVxVCOCraa	"It is not permissible for a Muslim to keep a dog, unless he needs this dog for hunting, guarding livestock or guarding crops.  <br>  <br>  Muslim (2978) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog that is not a dog for hunting, herding livestock or farming, two qiraats will be deducted from his reward each day.” <br>  <br>  Ibn Maajah (3640) narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah."|`|V4JVODaUaa	Just get a dog if you really want one,<br>  im 16 and thinking of getting a dog..my mom said yes but sadly most elders at the mosque have some radicalised views and put into my head its haram, napak etc but how can giving a home to a loving pet be haram, surely Allah can see this and remember the quran was written a while back, back then dogs were strays and diseased.<br>  Allah has more important things to worry about ie murderers, if it makes u happy thn im sure he wont mind, just wait till u get ur own place.<br>  <br>  EDIT ... yes it says Angels of mercy wont come into your house but leave the dog outside when you pray, did u kno they dont come in ur house if u hav a picture of a person in ur home..|`|5cFISJ8Qaa	Lol, i think dogs are unclean.<br>  <br>  I'm also scared of them.
62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Yes, I bought a steam mop off one of those TV info commercial, for $200 dollars plus $50 delivery. It looked like it was a very good product on TV for using on slate tiled and timber floors. <br>  <br>  When I received it (two months later) I discovered on the instructions that I couldn't use an extension cord with it. Also there was just only five cleaning replacement pads and no re-order form for more cleaning pads. <br>  <br>  I have called the company several times and left messages asking where can I buy them, or could I use something similar. I always get the same typical run around from them each time I've called.<br>  <br>  So I'm back using my regular mop to clean the floors with a $250 dollar useless piece of junk in my broom cupboard.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	I don't know if this counts but I once saw a poster that said join the army see the world meet interesting people an kill them, what it did not say was that most of the time they would shoot back ?|`|ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	Many, many times, that is why i either go by recommendations or research it.

csFp83i1aa	Ya i have heard and seen that thing... its terrible and i am so sorry. tell her that you are prayer for her son and that God is still watching over him and that he goes through these times as a teenager i went through a time when i was as far from God as i had ever been. i was swearing and gossiping nonstop. i knew i had a problem and the one thing i never did was forget God and i dont think her son with forget God either. God has helped him through his life so far and once he is on his knees lower than he has ever been before i can almost garentee he will look for a way out and hopefully if he has the right people around him it will be Jesus. Remind her of the parable of the lost son or the lost coin and how God doesnt give up on her son and will keep looking for her son and try and guide him back to God. I will pray for your friend also because prayer helps more than anyone knows.|`|tqIaTWkHaa	well... tell her it is not her fault. Tell her it was his own choice and that she should accept his doing wether she agrees with it or not. Tell her there is no point in her dreading over an act she did not commit, and that jesus will be forgiving in her sons act. Remember, her faith teaches her that God loves all. Christians, or any religion at all, shouldn't worry about things that will make God upset, but try to think of ways to make God happy.|`|542e578901be4c8e7844768f8ea65df9aa	shes not, he is.<br>  <br>  He never had faith to start with, who would exchange truth for a lie!!!<br>  <br>  She needs to pray for Christ to help, and be there for him.<br>  <br>  Thers nothing else she can do|`|NXCMRb8waa	He's just a teenager.

Learning a language isn't that hard as long as you practice but certain languages are easier to learn depending on your primary language.  Obviously Romance languages, once learning one make it easy to learn others. That's why I can read a great deal of French, Portuguese, and Italian.  For instance (I know it's obscure) when I spent time in Peru I learned some Quechua, but apparently I am able to pick it up easier than a person with Spanish as his first language because I learned English first.  <br>  <br>  My father speaks 5 languages fluently, and was able to learn them because he spoke Hindi and Gujurati as his first languages and picked up Marathi and Urdu in school.

I prefer English though|`|GrKiEDb1aa	In my 20 years in the U.S. Navy plus in the job I do now with foreign navies, I picked up 9 languages (Vietnamese, Russian [from a meteoroligical scientist from the Ukrain], Japanese[Kanto plains dialect], Italian[fairly fluent][Sardinian and Sicilian], Swahili , Turkish, Hindi, Cantonese, Arabic[spoken in eastern Saudi Arabia]).  I already knew some French, fairly fluent in Spanish and learned Finn from my grandmother.<br>  The languages I picked up in the Navy allowed me to shop, eat, not get lost, and carry on a limited conversation. The only problem I had was in France. Since I couldn't speak PERFECT French, they couldn't understand me.  However, when I was in Tunisia and Mauritius (island in the Indian Ocean), I had no problem at all being understood.  In fact, when I was in Tunisia, one shop keeper thought I was Italian because I spoke French with an Italian accent.<br>  Unfortunately, since I've not spoken anything besides Italian (my late supervisor and I both spoke Italian) and Spanish...to some degree...I've forgotten most of what I learned.<br>  Working with foreign navies, I noticed they weren't as chatty when I was around because they weren't sure just how much of their language I spoke/understood...Taiwan Navy, Indian Navy, Turkish Navy, Spanish Navy.  One problem I still have is I sometimes get my Spanish and Italian mixed up.|`|hEFthejvaa	4: english, italian, french, & somali. i was born in rome so that's where i learned italian. i later moved to international schools in guinea & senegal during elementary school. it was an english speaking school but all grades learned french as well.<br>  moving to the U.S. in middle school strengthened my english (everyone thinks i'm a native american). also, my parents are somali but they never bothered teaching me their native language for some reason. but they speak it to each other & i also learned from some somali friends of mine. i wouldn't say i'm fluent in somali but i can speak it & understand it. <br>  <br>  so that's the story.....|`|ry2XcFm6aa	I don't want to be rude peeps but knowing phrases doesn't mean you speak the language....lol it kinda sounds funny how alot of answers say that they speak this speak that funny shi....anwyays I speak 2 languages fluently...and for the question.. becoming fluent really takes time like sometiems you have to live in that country to learn and completely become fluent with the language I know people who have done it but still aren;t fluent with the language..... it's not like....when people say they know this person who speaks this/that language so now they speak it too...that's funny shi...and having good marks in school because they took language course doesn't mean they speak it..|`|EmOnt7FIaa	I am fluent in English and French, I am almost Fluent in Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese).<br>  <br>  I grew up learning English, so that wasn't much of an issue. I am taking French in school and I have became fluent in the language the third year I was taking it. I can understand French people and they can understand me. Some of my friends are Spanish, so I learned a lot of Spanish words and phrases from them. Also, last year I purchased "Rosetta Stone" Spanish (which was definitely not cheap, $500), so I am almost fluent in that language. I haven't really been spending that much time learning Spanish, I might start studying Spanish in my free time soon. As for Brazilian Portuguese, I just purchased some books on it.  I can write and speak a little bit but that is it. So I guess i'm not almost fluent in that but I'm still learning.<br>  <br>  I want to learn Arabic in the future.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	Im only fluent in english but i decided to just stick w/ improving in Spanish and learning Portuguese so far. And it depends on how much time you dedicate yourself to learning that language but some are harder than others.

In 1984 I owned an Atari computer briefly, that was one clumsy machine.  Mobile/cellular phones the size of a lunch box and a couple of years later cell phones the size of a red brick.  The list is endless, I still recall my folks have a Hi Fi entertainment set up.  Then there was the 8 track.  The original Atari Pong game, (had one of those in Germany once that the family loved as the selection on our one TV was pretty bad.  Don't forget the old cassette tape drives for computers, (Talk about a dinosaur).  I don't know buddy as I said the list is pretty much endless.  Good luck to you.|`|0l1ZairMaa	Mike S  really hit the nail on the head!<br>  Wow!

jiszVclaaa	ya i agree with u totally!!!! i mean, it says alot about the women who will have the baby and give it up for adoption instead of just aborting it, i think the governments need to encurage this more!!!<br>  <br>  abortion isnt allowed in ireland:)|`|dswiHNVRaa	Why is this question even being discussed here. Obviously this topic has nothing to do with LGBT issues, its an ethical, moral, and religious topic.<br>  <br>  One question though, since you brought it up......<br>  <br>  How many children have you adopted?|`|uky2nsh8aa	cc took what i was gonna say...<br>  <br>  and ur in the wrong section.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	I only believe it should be done if the pregnancy is a threat to the mother's health or both the mother and the baby. If a mother cannot take care of a child or is not willing, adoption or dropping the baby off at a nearby hospital, fire department or police station should suffice. It angers me when years after that law has been passed, babys are still being found abandoned in dumpsters to this day. In that case abortion would be more merciful. the point is, if it is a good pregnancy where the baby and mother are not facing death, adoption or giving it up should suffice. Not ending it's life or abandoning it in a dumpster. I'm getting off the soapbox now, ciao!|`|AA11374522	Look, I'll agree that abortion is a very ugly thing. But I find the thought of children being neglected, abused, and forced to grow up without a family to be even more ugly. Make no mistake, abortions will always be performed. They were before they were done by professionals and will continue to be if abortion is made illegal. Therefore, I believe that they should be kept legal so that they ca be performed as safely as possible. In addition, we need to provide proper sex education to people and promote birth control to decrease a woman's chances of conceiving an unwanted child.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	I do not believe in abortion unless it is medically necessary.<br>  <br>  That said, I think that every woman should have the right to choose to have an abortion. I do not think abortions should be done (unless medically necessary) after the 12th week.  Partial birth abortion is never OK (unless it is out of mercy for the child in cases of permanent suffering such as Tay Sachs). At that point, the child could survive on its own out side of the womb.<br>  -------<br>  <br>  Question for you, what do you think about homosexuals adopting?|`|HH90Eghaaa	You are mistaken on your law books! If the mother is killed with a non viable fetus, the murderer can not be charged for murdering the fetus too. They can only be charged if the fetus is viable, meaning it could have sustained life on its own! Please go back to your books!|`|oY4vwdjVaa	Until you've been in someone who has had an abortions shoes, I suggest you shut up about the topic.

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	“Shi'a” means a group of followers and it occurs in the Quran many times in reference to the followers of the previous prophets, such as Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and Prophet Musa (Moses).[8] Shi'a today refers to the followers of a particular school of Islamic thought, which is based on the teachings of the Prophet and his family, and sometimes it is referred to as the “school of Ahlul Bayt” (the family of the Prophet). While no schools of thought existed at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, he still used to refer to a certain group of people as the “Shi'a of Ali.”<br>  <br>  Some narrations in which the Prophet Muhammad used the term “Shi'a of Ali” are as follows:<br>  <br>  The parable of Ali is like a tree, in which I am the root, Ali is the branch, Hassan and Husayn are the fruits, and the Shi'a are the leaves.[9] (Ibn Hajar)<br>  <br>  We were gathering around the Prophet when Ali ibn Abi Talib came. He said, 'Verily, my brother has come to you,' and he placed his hand on the Ka?bah and said, 'By the One Who holds my soul in His hand, this man and his Shi'a will indeed be the successful ones on the Day of Judgment.'[10] (Narrated by Jabir ibn 'Abdillah al-Ansari)<br>  <br>  The Prophet of Allah was with me when his daughter Lady Fatima came to greet him with her husband Ali. The Prophet of Allah raised his head and said, 'Be happy Ali; you and your Shi'a will be in Paradise.'[11] (Narrated by Um Salamah, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad)<br>  <br>  You and your Shi'a will be in Paradise.[12]<br>  <br>  As these narrations show, the Prophet Muhammad himself was in fact, the first person to use the term “Shi'a,” and what's more is that he always used the term in reference to Imam Ali. After the Prophet passed away those who were loyal to Imam Ali were also known as the Shi'a. During the second century Hijrah (i.e., two centuries after the migration of the Prophet Muhammad from the city of Makkah to the city of Madina—the event which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar), the Abbasid caliphs officially patronized the four Sunni schools of thought which were popularized by the enthusiasm of some of their leaders. As for the Shi'a, after the assassination of Imam Ali, they followed the leadership of his son Hassan, and after him his brother Husayn, and the subsequent nine imams who were the descendants of Husayn. They followed them on the firm basis of evidence in the Noble Quran and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad who explicitly repeated on many occasions that he [the Prophet] would be followed by twelve imams and that they would all be from the tribe of Quraysh.[13] <br>  <br>  Therefore, Shi'ism can be termed as the following of the Noble Quran and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad as conveyed by his family, whom he appointed (i.e., the Ahlul Bayt). After the Prophet Muhammad, the Shi'a followed the twelve divinely ordained imams as successors of the Prophet Muhammad, as will be seen in the subsequent sections.<br>  <br>  REFERENCES:<br>  <br>  [8]    Noble Quran, 28.15<br>  <br>  [9]    Ibn Hajar, Lisan al-Mizan, Vol. 2, 354<br>  <br>  [10]  Tawzih al-Dala?il fiTashih al-Fada?il, 505<br>  <br>  [11]  Ibid., 507<br>  <br>  [12]  Ibn Asakir, “The History of the City of Damascus” Section: Biography of Imam Ali<br>  <br>  [13]  Sahih al-Bukhari; Sahih Muslim, Vol. 2, 191; Sahih al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 2, 45; Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 5, 106; Sunan Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, 207|`|SCkhQc2Caa	No where in Qur`aan mentions about Shi`ah of `Ali.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  mostly it usage in Qur`aan have a negative meaning.<br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  <br>  "As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects (Shiites), you have no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allaah: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did."

zxQT3Uo5aa	Addiction is not a joke and a poor exchange for good grades.|`|3PEQAUT9aa	You need to tell you mom. She can help you.  You need to get off the adderall. Also, if you can go from F's or A's with a pill, you can do it without it. You just need to focus more. You should really talk to your parents! If you don't, you WONT get into a good college and your WONT prosper in life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Do the right thing!|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Quit the **** while you can man, that ain't good for you.  Trust me, drugs are not the way to go, and clearly you know from experience.  Don't go getting addicted or whatever to speed dude, it isn't worth it.  It may seem fantastic now, but you will pay later.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision making.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	If they kinda already know you were trouble before, this probably won't be that bad. <br>  <br>  But I suggest you tell them and then let them know you want to see a doctor to see if he can diagnose you with ADHD or ADD and then you can get the med's legally.|`|AA11922229	Drugs mess with your nerve endings of all your senses. It's not an enhancement, it is rather a scrambling of the normal communication of the nerves. You like it for several reasons. You like the roller coaster effects. Your mind is swimming uncontrollably. It's an escape from the perceived serious world which you disdain. You are not aware yet of the dangers. One day you might wake up and realize how you've fried your brains.<br>  <br>  Take a look at some slobbering drunken homeless person on the street corner, homeless, penniless, unclean, and disgustingly smelly. He was lucky. He survived. For each guy you see like this thousands of others went on his the same path and died. That guy survived it. The lived hellish lives because they decide to be drug experimental at a young age. The drug addiction took over every aspect of their lives, rotting their brains and bodies from the inside, all the while they were too numb to realize it.<br>  <br>  Every waking moment of their lives are spent seeking the next chemical to consume as if it's going to bring them back or take them away, but it never does until the day they die.<br>  <br>  People have different propensities for addiction. You may need to guard yourself. Some people have psychological factors leading them to addictions. Some people have mental excuses to seek drugs such as traumatic histories.  Many people seek the adrenalin rush, inviting the risk along with the high, thinking themselves immortal. Others have a self destructive suicidal nature subconsciously wanting to die.<br>  <br>  It is interesting that a large percentage of our youth today accept drugs as a way of life. It is a mistake to believe drugs are safe either inside your body or inside the people you are with. Maybe it's fun and games for a time, but all of that is short lived when reality knocks.<br>  <br>  Drugs cause oxygen deprivation. Drugs have dangerous impurities which havoc the body. Drugs accelerate the aging process, and interfer with healing. Drugs initiate other major health risks.<br>  <br>  The greatest high I have known is being sober. That's as good as it gets and I'm never looking for anything better. When you do something good for someone you've realized the secret of life. <br>  <br>  Now if you have read this, and you want to change, go buy a candy bar and steal a bouquet of flowers for your mother, and tell her you love her very much. The hugs which follow will be the greatest high you can receive in this life.|`|AA12133859	Talk to your parents about rehab, you are an addict. You are taking speed.

Yout brain is too drug addled to even hear me.   If you can get good grades its not the drugs its because you are actually intelligent and you are squandering it.  <br>  <br>  You are PATHETIC and I pity your parents having such a loser son who is capable of so much more.|`|1zr0n8L1aa	tough. the right thing to do is to tell your mom. the smart thing to do is to keep buying the adderall. or maybe thats the dumb thing... sorry im not helping.|`|0UqOwLCjaa	You should stop taking any pills whatsoever.

Honestly the best thing I say is to get rid of the thing. It was not prescribed for you and it might have some side effects that have not been exposed yet.

I would be dissapointed with you that you wern't eating, but I would also want to know because I don't know if that has any risks without being diagnosed with ADHD. I would tell your mother and as for your "friend", he should have never sold perscriptions to you.|`|W0p0wf6baa	Ok so i'm 16 and was in a very similar place about 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  First think DO NOT MIX POT AND ADDERALLL!!!<br>  Second think see your gp DONT TELL THEM YOU TAKING THE ADDERALL!! not yet tell them u have been experiecing ADHD tendencies and ask if they can do some test.<br>  stay off the adderall for at lest 3 days before you go to your gp or it will come up in your blood steam.<br>  <br>  Don't stop the adderall quickly it can be very bad for you ween your self off it slowly.<br>  <br>  if the doctor can't help then either tell them about you taking the adderall  or tell your mum but please try to wean your self off them as fast as possible it my feel like it's helping but it can seriously screw u up there is other thinks the doctor can give you that isnt going 2 screw u up.<br>  <br>  i hope this help if u have any other question or need someone 2 talk 2 about it with some one who as been there done that. drop me an email randomeggs_003@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  and i can give u my mob number later if u want.<br>  <br>  hope this helps xoxo zoe
GBKaftrJaa	They technically didn't give you the money, their credit card did. So if they are coming up with a way to not pay their bills, you are out of your debt also.  I wouldn't rely on your parents any more for money though. They don't sound like they can manage their money.  I would put that $200/month into a savings account of yours so that when this car dies you can afford a new one.  Good luck.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Technically, you don't owe them the money if the debt is being discharged by bankruptcy (assuming it is).<br>  <br>  But, I think you should still keep paying until you've  paid them $8,000.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	pay them the money!!  They didn't have to put up the money for you, but they did.  The bankruptcy relieves them of debts depending on what chapter they are filing under.  It does not get you out of paying them the money you owe them.  They need the money, so pay them or give them the car!!  If they can prove they loaned you the money to get the car, they can re-posses the car for non payment.  They acted like the bank for you getting the car, instead of going through a regular bank or loan company.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Sounds like your parents are either not very good at basic money principles (which would seem to be the case, given that they bought a car with a credit card!!!), or they are simply dishonest.<br>  <br>  If they have not paid the money, and aren't going to, you certainly don't owe it to them.  They would be profiting by keeping money that is owed to the credit card company.  If they are going to pay that money to the credit company, then yes, you should pay them.<br>  <br>  Your folks need help.  Have them look into Dave Ramsey.  You should, too, unless you want to wind up where they are.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.daveramsey.com</a>|`|r4xRkqzdaa	technically, since if you can prove that the card's balance was dismissed as apart of the bankruptcy, technically they don't owe that money and neither do you<br>  <br>  however, since a bankrupcy is so bad for your future and your credit, i would agree to help them out for the next six months or one year because they are technically taking the burden for YOUR benefit<br>  <br>  i wouldn't pay them the whole 8k plus the HUGE interest... but maybe just give them enough to make up for the sacrifice that they make for you and help them get thru this tough time like they helped you when u couldn't get a car loan|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	I think no because if you pay them the money - that by rights is in turn owed to the bank by them - are they then planning to keep the bank's money? Are they going to take your continued payments and hand them over to the bank?<br>  <br>  If you pay them it's because they're your parents and to break a promise made to family is a dishonourable thing to do. They had to declare bankruptcy on thousands of dollars of debt incurred by you.<br>  <br>  So, who is right here? Should your parents forget your debt to them because the bank has wiped their debt, should you keep your  promise to them because they're your family even though they're going to keep the money?<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd pay my parents the total money owed for the interest they paid on my unpaid debt on their card, and I'd split the total debt remaining on my car and pay that because I'd feel I owe it to them for sharing their credit with me and having the bankruptcy on their names and not mine. Also, in the future, I may need their help again sometime.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.|`|AA11572187	Maybe you should pay them a little bit because they had to pay interest on that $8000... even if it was a low rate.  But they are trying to make money off of you, which is unfortunate.  Talk to them about it nicely and try to explain logically that you will compensate them for any loss they have taken due to your vehicle, but not more than that.|`|68gwcrTTaa	I think you should continue paying them because they did let you borrow the money anyway. They did you a favor now you do them a favor.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	Depends. Do you love your parents? I guess if you love them and want to help them out you could continue the payments. But I don't really know.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	your parents are trying to make a profit on their own child. unreal.

N8QLKpCMaa	Good Q !<br>  so as well so called muslims kill muslims too, but scholars always tell it, Quran ,hadith says it, our own people say it , law says it , but what of such rebels ?<br>  well scholars & preachers are working for it & telling them not to destroy peace of world .<br>  you know killing far even teasing, making fun , hitting , abusing or taunting are not allowed to us.<br>  no immoral attitude is allowed ?<br>  God bless you !|`|GzlckRcnaa	How about Sunni n Shia?..they too are muslims.the situation is quite same i think.we can't assume that every muslims really use their brain when dealing with each other.i don think the muslims of "gang" war in Britain between the Somalis and the Afghanis hold n refer Al-Quran&Hadith as their guide in life.while Islam is a perfect way of life,many muslims today seem to ignore Al-Quran&Hadith.So,a small matter burst into a big problem.<br>  <br>  Islam don allow you to kill anyone including the muslims without a strong/reasonable reason.the word Islam itself means peace but the muslims today aren't in peace bcoz they don take Islam seriously in their life.|`|vwFf2ftcaa	I don't live in the UK and I didn't hear this before but I'm not surprised.<br>  Muslims are the worst enemies of each other.

JGJKWpuvaa	yes they do! I was at an attraction at Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls. I was waiting on line for quite a while and it was my turn to enter the place. But then this kid, who was immensely impatient, started to cry his way into the crowd. Mommy tried to calm her annoying brat down but the kid had to cry louder and harder. Push-over mommy then begged us to move over and let them in. Then the other lil kids stuck their fangs out and came close to beatin up the annoying cry baby. So push over momma and spoiled brat had to back off and went to the end of the line.<br>  <br>  <br>  I grew up in a Filipino family where children are supposed to obey their parents and not to bring them shame (yes, small things can cause shame in my house). I learned that I can't always have my way...or else. So I grew up patient and nice. So in short, the way parents raise their children dramatically affects how their kids behave. The mom begging us and letting her kid have his way just shows poor parenting.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Most children, but not all, are brats and they're not nice to be around; usually the children are so badly behaved because they're a miniature reflection of their parents.<br>  <br>  If a child is pleasant and generally a good child who is respectful of others, I don't have a problem with children. Just with brats who do not appear to be in short supply.<br>  <br>  It would be nice if there were more holiday destinations of varying prices and activities that only adults (21+) could use.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  July 2009!, it's the same for Western culture.

And no, I don't have kids, so that's not why I'm saying it.  There are certain places that aren't good to bring very young kids to, like movie theatres, and it's not good to have kids out late at night because they get tired and upset.  But I don't see a problem with kids being in most other places.  And it's the parents that have to "deal" with the stuff you listed, not the rest of us.  We can just ignore it.|`|XNBMzuxbaa	No, adults who raise the children to be like that ruin holidays. It's the adults responsibility to raise their children to behave properly.

That's why live-in help receives salaries, not hourly wages.<br>  <br>  However, no matter the manner of compensation, respect is the foundation of the relationship. If the client you care for needs psychiatric help, then he/she perhaps does not know better because of a mental illness. I do not know how bad the abuse is, but you realize that person is not his/herself anylonger and that is the reason that person needs care. But the family, and the other helpers (such as the psychiatrist) should respect you the more. Who is there when your charge screams at night--it is you! Even if your client, in the throes of mental illness, mistreats you because he/she does not know better anylonger, they should treat you well. You should tell them that, too.|`|r4xRkqzdaa	okay, maybe you are doing just a little venting....<br>  <br>  but that is fine and can make you feel better.  a person should be able to talk about anything with their psychiatrist and have confidentiality with that person- so technically the client was mistreated as well<br>  <br>  a person should get paid for every hour they work.  when you are off shift they are not obligated to work, unless they are allowed to clock back in.  keep good track of your hours!|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	I'm sorry, I had a very hard time trying to understand your question.<br>  <br>  Would you mind revising it then reposting it?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Tom, why can't you leave the job or go to anyone for help?

If you are being treated disrespectfully and/or abusively here,  take a caregiver job for someone else.  Someone who needs that kind of care may be cranky at times because they don't feel good, but what you describe sounds like a lot more than that.  There are lots of this type of  job available.

9Z1d0i6faa	I was a very heavy smoker, smoked about 2 1/2 packs a day.  I stopped cold turkey (used trident gum lol).  I had strong cravings for the first 3 days, then it got a little better.  The intensity and number of cravings a day started to drop everyday after that.  By the end of two weeks I was only having like 3-4 cravings a day and they only lasted for a minute or two and were gone.  Then around week 4, I was coasting along feeling great and WHAM...I got slapped upside the face with a craving that was like (or maybe a little stronger) than the first/second day cravings.  I had really intense cravings like this about once a day for the next 1 1/2 weeks.  After that they turned into very low intensity cravings about every other day.  And right now I couldn't honestly tell you when my last craving was (been a while).  <br>  <br>  Hang in there you can do this, you only have a day or two more to go and it will get easier.  In a month or two you will look back and be like "why did it take me so long to quit?"|`|9xM1JPjCaa	from personal expirence the really intense cravings last for about a month, but then you start to feel so good that you have very little desire to smoke (this is how i felt)  also whenever you have a bad craving, just remeber cravings only last 15 min so just time it and then the urge to smoke mostly has gone away.  that always really helped me|`|51ba97a2a52ae3eb23ef742450ca66a9aa	i dont smoke but my friend does. he said it was abouot 2 month after he stopped smoking. to distract hiimself, he does different things like playing computer games, going out and stuffs

Or gross editing.<br>  <br>  News organizations in general are still biased towards a white male, heterosexual and (in America) Christian view, and no surprise that any "success stories" in the romance department are all of the heterosexual variety. This is also reinforced by practically all institutions in our lives, like the church, schools, government offices, the malls and their promotions (especially on Valentine's), greeting cards...everywhere you look, in ways both subtle and not quite so, the underlying message is: Romance is reserved for a man and a woman only, not 2 men or 2 women.<br>  <br>  Precisely why I also believe the best way to combat homophobia is the grassroots level. SInce people in power pretty much dictate what we read, see, and digest in every other form of media, it behooves us to change the views of people we come into contact, everyday. (Can't get any more grassroots than that.)<br>  <br>  If you need proof of the grassroots approach being successful, look no further than who the current President of the USA is, someone who the "political establishment" scoffed at and looked down upon, for having no political lineage nor backers.<br>  <br>  There is hope.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Well we have pretty much the same life goals as straights!<br>  Finish school!<br>  Get job!<br>  Find love, partner, husband, domestic partner, civil union, etc!<br>  Children? that depends on the couple<br>  <br>  But mainly I don't see how you can feel lost!

AA10729675	Passé composé is for a very punctual time.<br>  Imparfait is for duration, and repetition.<br>  So that you can use them in the same sentence but in different clause like in English:  I was eating my dinner when the phone rang<br>  Je mangeais mon repas quand le téléphone a sonné.<br>  <br>  J'avais l'habitude de faire du jogging tous les matins quand je me suis tordu le pied un  matin:  I used to do jogging every morning when one morning I twisted my ankle.<br>  <br>  It has the same resonance as those English tenses and the same use.<br>  <br>  Imperfect is descriptive also.  Not passe compose.  <br>  Le soleil se levait, la lumière déjà pointait à l'horizon, quand tout à coup (suddenly) un grand vent s'est mis à souffler.<br>  <br>  In fact the both tenses work in correlation.  <br>  <br>  Once you know this, and once you understand the passé composé totally, then you'll learn that in literature we use the very punctual passe simple instead of the passé composé.<br>  <br>  But first you have to master the passé composé and the rules of agreement with the past participle.  I hoped I helped.<br>  <br>  Bonne chance!|`|iLFYj6Qgaa	You don't necessarily use imparfait and passé composé in the same sentence. You can use them both in one story though, like you say, to make a difference between description and action, for example.<br>  <br>  e.g. Jean MANGEAIT (imp.) une tartine, comme il AVAIT (imp.) l'habitude de faire tous les matins. Il REGARDAIT (imp.) autour de lui dans la cuisine. Les murs ETAIENT (imp.) verts. A neuf heures, la porte S'EST OUVERTE (passé c.) et une jeune fille EST ENTREE (passé c.) dans la cuisine.<br>  --> Jean was eating a sandwich, like he used to do every morning. He looked around in the kitchen. The walls were green. At 9 a.m., the door opened and a girl walked into the kitchen.|`|5HvxRNIyaa	I don't think  u can use l'imparfait with passe compose because it won't working unless if u say: j'avais achetee une pair de soulier. meaning that i bought a pair of shoes. or u say : j'ai achetee une pair de soulier. u know  French is very difficult to conjugate man because there's a lot of tenses in english we only have future , present, past but in French  we have a lot of tenses .For instance , we have present, past, future, future anterior, passe compose, subjunctive, conjunctive, future exterior, l'imparfait.<br>   i think i'll help
2PZnXjZ7aa	On the contrary, I think she was generous in giving to a religion that wasn't her own. Many Christians wouldn't do such a thing. As long as it's helping the people or the community it doesnt matter if it is organized by a religious group or not.|`|5urfAbazaa	uhm.... no... your friend was just doing a random act of kindness.|`|HBp5r76haa	Yes<br>  <br>  There is no real atheist|`|nooi0ldjaa	she gave something to someone she felt needed it...that's called a nice person not a hypocite atheist.<br>  <br>  that just pokes another hole in the "atheists are mean people who hate christans!" theory ...|`|AA10556726	No, she was being empathetic and acting morally.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	No.<br>  <br>  Kindness is welcome at any time.  Your friend is a kind person.  Simple.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Maybe, but God bless her. I wish more Christians were as thoughtful as your friend the Atheist.|`|2rJwgk40aa	No.Being a hypocrite would be talking baout being selfless and giving to others,then ignoring someone when they asked for it.she wasnt being a hypocrite.she was doing osmething good.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	no.  who ever said an atheist can't donate money to a church?  i would think it was hypocritical that you (assuming you believe in god) didn't donate money.|`|ZvmwnLlfaa	No, that's kind of her.  Unless she was meaning to judge everyone who didn't give money, that's wrong. But I don't see a problem.<br>  God bless|`|SWfaNKSgaa	Not a hypocrite. Generally, I think your friend was just trying to do a nice thing.|`|gAzb5PAbaa	No, we can still donate money.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Why is helping others being hypocritical?  She doesn't have to believe in a church to help one.  How much did you give?|`|rn7UAtYJaa	No she can be feeling kind. Atheists do have morals.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	No actually she was being kind. I have donated to churches that damn my faith to hell before.|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	Not in the least is that hypocritical. Your friend felt compassion for her and her cause, regardless of her own disbelief in the God that motivates the woman. It's makes me think "damned if you do, damned if you don't!" What's a respectable atheist to do these days? Did you really expect your friend to scream "get away from me, you freakin' nutcase!"?|`|VnNzPKA8aa	Oh Heck in a basket -- an atheist being nice!!!! take away her atheist card.|`|c5VABL0oaa	I'm an atheist and my taxes pay for your churches... Does that make me a hypocrite as well?<br>  <br>  She was doing something nice and donating money. How is that hypocritical? Only Christians have the audacity to deem good acts "christlike" and bad acts "ungodly." Atheists can do good things too, despite the fact that we are free from the bondage of religion. We don't need God to hold our hand and tell us what is right and what is wrong.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Only if you think Atheists are without feelings...I own a small business and at least 4 times a year I help with fundraising for a local church that has set up a section of their church to serve as a safe hangout for local kids. The fundraising is for buying toys, tv, video game systems...anything that helps to occupy the kids and keep them from running wild in the streets.<br>  <br>  I could care less about helping Jesus or God...kids I do care about.<br>  <br>  That is part of the reason I could never be a christian...I would have to either ignore or make excuses for why the bible god would drown thousands of babies in a great flood and why the bible god would order one group of humans to slaughter the women and infants belonging to another group of humans. baby murdering gods are not gods to me and I certainly would never put myself in the position of justifying or making excuses for a god that would...<br>  <br>  You want to talk about hypocrisy...how about the way christians go all out ballistic against abortion but then will sit there and make excuses and justifications for why their god murdering children is a "good" thing?|`|Z92LPUqaaa	No, your friend is just naive.  That person was probably not doing anything for a church in the first place.  You notice those people walking around in traffic dressed nicely and asking for donations for their church, often times they are scam artists.|`|Fpi8im9taa	There's nothing hypocritical about giving money to people who need it.<br>  <br>  Just because atheists aren't people of faith doesn't make it so that they're prevented from donating to churches.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	No. She donated money, she didn't suddenly say "Oh, I suddenly believe in GOD!"<br>  <br>  See? Atheists have morals and hearts too. As a Christian, why didn't YOU donate money?|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	Giving is never hypocritical.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	No, she's being compassionate.<br>  <br>  Just because you don't believe in god, doesn't mean you don't care about people.  Even church going people.|`|075c7DdDaa	How is that being hypocritical?|`|82AAOxCfaa	nothing hypocritical about it. she just donated.|`|lmAhmZfzaa	She was just trying to help a sweet woman have a better day.|`|KmULmT7Baa	No she's doing a selfless act, shouldn't you be doing that? I thought Christians were the good ones.|`|rLc1QeVbaa	um no.<br>  atheists are allowed to donate money to people they pity.|`|G4XkXsbeaa	No, she was just being nice and helping a person out.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Did she say what the money was for??? maybe your friend thought it was a worthwhile cause..|`|PHZUzww2aa	No she is not being hypocritical. She doesn't believe in god, but she still gives money to people who need it. If anything, she's being true to her morally sound atheist self.<br>  <br>  A hypocritical atheist would be someone who says they are atheist but believes in a god. They would in fact not be an atheist at all.|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	no|`|WGBWblFxaa	I don't understand why this made your friend a hypocrite...she just felt bad for the woman...|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	not at all <br>  I still give to others and care about people  I just don't need any imaginary friends now that I grew up. <br>  I don't give because of guilt like she did I give because it makes me feel good about making the world a better place.|`|19JkC34Xaa	No, we call that being nice.|`|u93oneUXaa	No she isn't.. just because she doesn't believe in it doesn't mean she can't respect the beliefs of others.|`|qktzCVvMaa	I don't understand why you are struggling to make her into a bad person.

And that is exactly what I will get.|`|5urfAbazaa	nope, what's to fear? that'd just make it really cool that God existed, and I'm sure us atheists would have a whole lot of questions for Him.|`|QsCPOHAraa	Maybe we talk so much about it because it just absolutely baffles us that so many people on this planet could believe something so ridiculous.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	no, i'm not afraid because if there is, i'd only have a <br>  1/5000 chance of picking the right religion anyway|`|FLUcZ9uPaa	Actually I fear what could happen to me if I was wrong sometimes ~Honest Atheist.|`|AA11297267	What is it with you religious people?<br>  You assume atheists are afraid there could be a god, you assume atheists don't believe because they hate god, you assume some priest or pastor was mean to use, and on and on and on...<br>  <br>  Look:  no evidence, no god.  That's it.  Simple, short, easy enough that even religious people should be able to understand.  Got it?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	And the reason that religious people Loathe atheists isn't because they're afraid the atheists might be right, but because that's the righteous thing to do...|`|93r3nCM1aa	Nope. <br>  <br>  Why would an obviously scientific God (who created the universe and all of the "laws" within it) condemn someone for asking for proof?|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Sure, since they are not serving God, they are serving satan, and he is the author of fear and confusion...|`|czf6uhIraa	No, I do not fear your imaginary magical man, and I don't see how that explains why atheists ask questions...|`|hFnkvO9taa	Reverse the question , what about all the God bother-es pass over and theirs nowt nothing zero zilch bugger all ?? then what .|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	I only fear Fundies.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	I think it's a kind of sport for them.

I think there could be a god or gods.  I'm doing my honest searching.  I've yet to find anything but a load of bull thus far, but I'm still looking.

ClZWgDoxaa	Yes of course everybody has faith based on that definition.. Any belief, by that defintion, would pretty much be faith.|`|7ViHb7cwaa	I think without faith in something we would fail as humans. I'm not a Christian at all, but I strongly believe that the power of people who care about one another and do their best to live a life filled with doing good things for other people can achieve anything. I guess there is no tangible proof that it feels good to do something good for someone else without gaining from it, and it is definitely possible to believe this with strong conviction, perhaps even possible to completely trust it.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Faith is belief without evidence.  The statement is incorrect in its usage of the word.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	You must at least have faith in your own existence or perception.|`|nxBBIJp0aa	2|`|1AOr7waCaa	2 N 3 SHUT UP YALL NEED TO BELIVE I NGOD DAMN==|`|ZoPln7vaaa	I have faith|`|luwBPdE8aa	I have faith that my car will start in the morning.|`|neuprBeGaa	I disagree.  Granted, if you include definition #3, you can probably find something for most anyone that you can point to and claim that it is a "belief with strong conviction."  But look at your examples.<br>  <br>  Belief in a god/gods - probably a belief without proof or evidence.  Exception for those who believe they have spoken with their gods, but in general, this does seem to be "faith."<br>  <br>  Belief in the nature/course of an event - is probably the result of observation of similar events, previous identical events, etc.  If I state that I believe a brick will fall to the ground when I drop it, that is not a belief based in faith, but one based in experience with gravity near the surface of a planet.<br>  <br>  Belief in their own abilities - again, is probably based on experience, as well as an intimate knowledge of those abilities.<br>  <br>  Additionally, I suspect that there are very few examples of someone placing COMPLETE trust in anything.  For example, I won't bet my life that the sun will rise tomorrow - it might have gone nova over on the other side of the planet, or some other disaster might prevent it.<br>  <br>  To use the word "faith" to define all those different beliefs is to stretch the definition beyond useful meaning.  Especially if you then plan to use the word to attack someone who does not base their life on faith.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	I believe that, everyone has faith in something...that is true, I have faith in God only , that is the way it will remain for me...<br>  Anything else will not last anyway, and cannot get you out of no kind of bad situation...everything that you put your trust in but Jesus, will fail...that is sure...|`|iNn9mmOtaa	the law is not of faith,<br>  so start your faith-->hope-->charity never fails<br>  with grace, unless you want your hope to hopeless<br>  and your love(God) to fail as often as people divorce|`|AA10556726	I don't disagree with the definition(s).  I disagree with how it is applied in many cases.

nsbWaiW0aa	modesty is not showing your whole body in see-through or tight clothes when you go out. it's also not always pulling attention toward yourself and making others around you feel bad. modesty isn't flirting with random people you meet. it's what a good muslim should be.|`|zP0U1lp9aa	Modesty is simply being comfortable with yourself and not in competition with anyone else.  It is not dressing to prove your piousness or your marital worth or that you are in love with (or fearful of) some god, it is not dressing to please others.  Modesty is living life to the fullest and never giving a thought to what you are wearing.  I was raised in a muslim home, hi jab wearing females was all I knew.  My wife who is truly the most modest person I have ever known has run naked through the woods.  It took me 30 some years but I finally know, modesty is not ever defined by clothing.  It seems strange to me now that I would have ever judged a person's modesty based on what they happen to be wearing or not wearing at the time.  Modesty is a state of being, not in what fashion choice you make.|`|ScYaBMKvaa	Modesty is when you have self-respect and you dress appropriately. Modesty also comes from within. Modesty is an attitude of propriety and decency in dress, grooming, language, and behaviour. Modesty is when you have sheltered yourself enough from the outer shell so you do not draw unnecessary attention from both men and women. Modesty from within is when you have reverence and self-assurance in yourself, and you act in a conventional way around others. <br>  <br>  Hey Natassia, just wanted to inform you that weight/figure/body shape is due to environmental causes.  Weight is not inherited. God has blessed us with a beautiful heart, and a brain. If we are aware that our body is attracting others, then we should cover up. <br>  <br>  ?σч ?|`|wSqDeNIOaa	Going above and beyond what others would, knowing you went that far, but yet, repeating it over and over again because you know in your heart, you're good enough to be consistent with no outside interference.  Then, repeat the same thing the following day and love it.  I forgot to mention, modesty is feeling like you're "doing your job", even if it knocks everyone off their feet, but you don't mention it. Good question!|`|Rcgy1uDYaa	How the Quran describes it:<br>  <br>  “And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear therof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’ fathers, their sons, their husbands’ sons, their brothers, or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons, or their women or the servants whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex, and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O you Believers, turn you all together towards Allah, that you may attain Bliss.” (Quran 24:31). <br>  <br>  “O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.” (Quran 33:59)|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's more inner than outer.<br>  <br>  It's about not wanting to attract unnecessary attention...not wanting to be the "star of the show."<br>  <br>  That's all.<br>  <br>  If you have a nice body, you have a nice body.  Being modest about it means dressing like the average person in society...it doesn't mean you have to go to extra lengths to hide what God blessed you with.<br>  <br>  If blue jeans are considered modest wear in a society, then it's just as modest for a woman with a beautiful figure to wear them as it is for a woman with an unattractive figure.<br>  <br>  Clothing and styles are based on societal norms and traditions.  It has nothing to do with a divine Being.|`|5vA7kkeyaa	The second answer is pretty good except it strayed where "drawing attention" to yourself is mentioned. Modesty is not about somebody else's (man's) behaviorr. It is about youbehaviorur. You can never control who pays you undue attention and thus you can not be held responsible for another's intention.|`|AA12133859	I am Christian and from the USA.

The bible is a human construct to control populations.<br>  The council of Nicea were very picky about which of all the many gospels written should be include in the final version of the bible.<br>  Anything that wasn't advantageous to the powers that ruled at that time was excluded.<br>  <br>  Manipulation at its finest.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	We know that God says, that His ways are not like our ways...that means the way He deals with things and thinks about situations and solves them is never the way we would do it, with our logical mind...<br>  And so many think that they are living the right way, but they are really just pleasing themselves and not God...that is what God is saying here, that they think that they are on the right track, but they are not...<br>  And there are many on the wrong track...<br>  When you go around asking people if they think they are going to heaven when they die...almost 100 % will tell you , that they think they are...<br>  We know that this is not true, the bible tells us, that more people are going to hell than to heaven...so you see, it seems right in their eyes, but not in God's...|`|UO9x4Curaa	in general it is the way of obeying God's commands merely in the letter and overlooking the Spirit. In this way men overlook that in which alone real obedience to God consists, namely, the state of mind--the real motive and spirit in which a deed is done. Men do what their conscience demands, outwardly, but not with the heart. They obey in the letter, but they disobey in the spirit. Their obedience is constrained, not loving and cheerful; and therefore, it is really no obedience at all. They yield to the demands of their conscience as to the letter of the precept; and there, with them, obedience ends. This seems to them to be obedience, and therefore they expect from it God's favor and heaven at last; but they deceive themselves; for the end of this way is only death.<br>  <br>  But it will be well to enquire here--<br>  <br>  Why do men think this way to be right?<br>  <br>  Because it is required, both by conscience and by the sacred scriptures. For example, honesty in business; prayer to God. These and similar duties, both conscience and the Bible require. Of course it seems right to do them. And it truly is right. Outwardly, it is the thing God demands. But they overlook the fact that God does and must demand something more than the outward. They forget that real obedience consists in the loving state of mind in which the externally right things are done. They forget that, while "man looketh on the outward appearance, God looketh on the heart."<br>  <br>  But why do men thus deceive themselves? Because they are in a dishonest, selfish state of mind. They are in a state like Paul's when he verily thought he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth; but the reason of his verily thinking so lay in the strong committal of his soul to Judaism and to his selfish interests in that system. Really he was not in an honest state of mind, and therefore was not prepared to judge truly in such matters. In a dishonest state of mind, men are satisfied with cheap service done for God. They are by no means careful to give him good measure. Perhaps they do not even think for a moment that, by the very necessity of his position as Moral Governor of the universe, he must demand the sincere homage of the heart. They think to turn him off with miserably cheap service. They would not themselves be satisfied with such service from their own wives or children. A merely outside show of obedience and affection would not satisfy them. Yet strangely they assume that such outside obedience in their case will satisfy God! Being in a thoroughly selfish state of mind, they are blind to the spiritual demands of God's law. They have no just conceptions of the real nature of their own righteousness. They assume it to be a fair and perfect robe, but God accounts it only as filthy rags--not rags only--but filthy rags--loathsome and foul--intolerable.<br>  <br>  Such persons are blind to the spirit of God's law. For example, the law which requires them to pay a debt to a neighbor. In a selfish spirit, one will pay such a debt because the civil law demands it, and he cannot avoid paying it. Or he may do it selfishly to sustain his reputation. But the truly benevolent man pays this debt out of love to his neighbor. He remembers the law, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," and he considers nothing less than this, as real obedience to God. Because he loves his neighbor, therefore he pays to him what he owes him. This, and this only is obeying in the true spirit of obedience.<br>  <br>  So selfish men go to the house of God to please themselves and not to please God. They have no heart in it. This seems to them to be right, but it seems so, only because they are selfish, and do not deeply consider the matter. They do not ask themselves--Would I be pleased with such service from my wife or from my children? Would I be satisfied if my servants thought only of the outward appearance and had no proper respect for my feelings and wishes?<br>  <br>  This kind of service is all wrong, however right it may seem. It does not answer the demands of the law of God. This law demands the homage of the heart, and can accept of nothing less. How then can it accept that which is wholly selfish?<br>  <br>  This sort of obedience is not the way to heaven. It does not make the heart mellow, humble, holy; indeed it has no such influence at all, but rather the opposite. It only makes the heart vain, proud, hard and yet more selfish.<br>  <br>  It should never be forgotten that any obedience which is not from the heart and from real love is no obedience at all.<br>  <br>  People are prone to congratulate themselves on their selfish and external obedience, but such obedience is not performing their duty to God or to man either. It leaves the soul in sin and in bondage.<br>  <br>  This delusion is wholly inexcusable. Some men, willing to justify themselves, will ask--How should a man act if he may not do what seems to him right?|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	Personally, I think it is referring to the people who think they know the right way to heaven but are not accepting Jesus as their Lord and Savior. They think good work or being a nice person or ??? will gain them entrance to God's heaven but it is not the right road to be on.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	yeah the kid down the street says don't be a fool too but each of us learn that one the hard way usually . and there is still the way of right thinking and it ends in death as well as does all life eventually.|`|hr4zqzLJaa	Making wise choices and being successful in life certainly require the ability to distinguish what is right from what is wrong. However, the Bible warns: “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward.” (Proverbs 14:12) Hence, we must learn to differentiate what is truly right from what appears to be right. The expression “the ways of death” indicates that there are many such deceptive paths.What is the result if we ignore that fact and rely  just either on ourselves or on other humans for determinations as to what is wise or unwise, right or wrong? Because of being guided by fleshly reasoning, there will be times when we may view as good what God says is bad, when we may consider to be wise a course that God labels foolish. (Isaiah 5:20) <br>  (Isaiah 5:20) 20?Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness, those who are putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!|`|9pcoa6WIaa	The choices that people make seem right in the beginning but the end result is not favorable to Gods standards.<br>  <br>  So unless it is enlightened and trained by a sure standard of righteousness, that conscience is merely one’s own judgment of his actions. An unenlightened or a misguided conscience can lead to disaster. That is why it is not always wise to “let your conscience be your guide.” God’s Word declares: “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward.”|`|wSqDeNIOaa	Take the book apart all you want.

IwXuWX05aa	To make a short story even shorter, I grew up and put away a few of my childhood notions.  I was raised christian, but by the time I was 12, I began questioning.  The more questions I asked, the more I saw people dancing around them rather than answering.  Those who did attempt to answer could not speak logically.  Sadly,  I realized, just like Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, leprechauns, and pots of gold at the end of the rainbow, there was no Jesus or great invisible wish granter in the sky.<br>  <br>  Now here's some good news.

Then, suddenly in my country which was almost like a catholic cult upto 1993 we began to discover the priests often had hidden families by several women or were serial child sex abusers and because they had presented themselves as God's image on earth people stopped believing.They were, to use a Jesus word Hypocrites.<br>  Its ironic because Jesus was murdered by the very same type of people years ago for speaking out against their arrogance in stealing God from his people and pawning off their version of God which was a scam to keep control over people and bully them with terms like "sinners" that we still see fanatical christians use today.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	For one, because I don't believe in the Christian God or any other god.<br>  For another reason, because I don't believe in Christianity's teachings.<br>  <br>  Are you "nutz"?|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	Nope, not nuts.

EM0kiImHaa	The good news, as we try to answer this question, is that there is much that can be found out about God! Those who examine this explanation may find it helpful to first read through it entirely; then go back and look up selected Scripture passages for further clarification. The Scripture references are completely necessary, for without the authority of the Bible, this collection of words would be no better than man's opinion; which by itself is often incorrect in understanding God (Job 42:7). To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement! Failure to do so will likely cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).<br>  <br>  Only what God has chosen of Himself to be revealed can be known. One of God's attributes or qualities is "light", meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19, James 1:17). The reality that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected, lest any one of us come short of entering His rest (Hebrews 4:1). Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.<br>  <br>  Let's start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1 Psalm 24:1). God said that man is created in His image. Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28). Creation is marred by the 'fall' but still offers a glimpse of His works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20). By considering creation's vastness, complexity, beauty, and order we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.<br>  <br>  Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like. They are as follows:<br>  <br>  Elohim - strong One, divine (Genesis 1:1)<br>  Adonai - Lord, indicating a Master to servant relationship (Exodus 4:10,13)<br>  El Elyon - Most High, the strongest One (Genesis 14:20)<br>  El Roi - the strong One who sees (Genesis 16:13)<br>  El Shaddai - Almighty God (Genesis 17:1)<br>  El Olam - everlasting God (Isaiah 40:28)<br>  Yahweh - LORD "I Am", meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13,14).<br>  <br>  We will now continue by examining more of God's attributes; God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and that His existence will never end. He is immortal, infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17). God is immutable, meaning He is unchangeable; this means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26,27). God is incomparable, meaning there is no one like Him in works or being; He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48). God is inscrutable, meaning He is unfathomable, unsearchable, past finding out in entirely understanding Him (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 145:3; Romans 11:33,34).<br>  <br>  God is just, meaning He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30). God is omnipotent, meaning He is all-powerful; He can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17,27). God is omnipresent, meaning He is ever-present, everywhere; this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23). God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, even what we are thinking at any given moment; since He knows everything His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).<br>  <br>  God is one, meaning not only that there is no other, but also that He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts, and He alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4). God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing; it is because of His righteousness and justice that in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God's judgment when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).<br>  <br>  God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme; all of His creation put together, whether knowingly or unknowingly, cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20). God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24). God is a Trinity, meaning He is three in one, same in substance, equal in power and glory. Notice that in the first Scripture passage cited that 'name' is singular even though it refers to three distinct Persons- “Father, Son, Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19; Mark 1:9-11). God is truth, meaning that He is in agreement with all that He is, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).<br>  <br>  God is holy, meaning that He is separated from all moral defilement and is hostile toward it. God sees all evil and it angers Him; fire is usually mentioned in scripture along with holiness. God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2,4,5; Hebrews 12:29). God is gracious - this would include His goodness,|`|hTiQppf2aa	As a Muslim are attribution is very clear and very simple, inm Surah Iklhas (Chapter 112) of the Glorious Qur'an it reads<br>  <br>  Qul huwallahu Ahad<br>  Allahu Samad<br>  Lam Yalid wa lam Yulad <br>  Wa lam ya kul lahu kufwan Ahad<br>  <br>  Say!

He is outside the space time continuum, so much so that he can experience a parity of duration equivalent of a thousand years buffered to 1 day and 1 day expanded to a thousand years (2 Peter 3:8). We as humans cannot do that. We must experience one day at a time. God's thoughts are not our thoughts (Isaiah 55:8). We are physical. God is spirit (John 4:24). There are spirit beings who have had no parents (Hebrews 7:3). The Father (the Most High God) was not born and has no parents. He will exist eternally into the future (Revelation 11:15). He has existed eternally in the past (Titus 1:2). Our minds are finite and we cannot conceptualize the idea of eternally into the past due to this limitation in our minds. Nevertheless we can acknowledge the fact. We, as humans have to gain power as we grow up because we are physical. However, it is the nature of God (who is spirit) to be all powerful, almighty (Genesis 17:1). His power is also inifinite (having no end). <br>  <br>  Our existence is bounded by the speed of light.  But God IS light! (1 Timothy 6:16).  His Son is the light for this planet (John 8:12, John 9:5, John 12:46).  <br>  <br>  Generally physical things are superior when they are more complex. The Spirit world is the opposite. That which is superior has more simplicity (2 Corinthians 11:3).  Any one who has seen Christ has, in essence, seen the Father (John 14:9).  There was no need for God to be created.  God is self-existent; He is the great I AM (Exodus 3:14).  God has the attributes of power, creativity, and balance. It is through the sacrifice of his Son that we have a chance at salvation (Acts 4:12).   <br>  <br>  "Remember the former things of old: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else; [I am] God, and [there is] none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times [the things] that are not [yet] done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: Yes, I have spoken [it].  I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed [it], I will also do it" (Isaiah 46:9-11).|`|ZoPln7vaaa	<a href="http://www.allaboutgod.com/attributes-of-god.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutgod.com/attributes-of...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbministries.org/books/pink/Attributes/attributes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbministries.org/books/pink/A...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.preceptaustin.org/attributes_of_god.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.preceptaustin.org/attributes_...</a>|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	He separates things.<br>  <br>  He blesses those who trust Him, and curses those who don't.<br>  <br>  He cares for those who trust Him.<br>  <br>  He loves those who trust Him.<br>  <br>  He saves those who trust Him.<br>  <br>  He provides for those who trust Him.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Loving and Merciful.|`|MbCFe1odaa	if there was a god and he/she made us in their image we would have wings and be able to breathe under water.... humans are far from perfect creations

We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them. <br>  <br>   4 When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. 5 It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites. 6 Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. <br>  <br>   7 Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. <br>  <br>   8 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. <br>  <br>   9 After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills. 10 They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. <br>  <br>   11 From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). 12 And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher." 13 Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. <br>  <br>   14 One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him [a] to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?" <br>  <br>   15 She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. <br>  <br>   16 The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms [b] with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad. <br>  <br>   17 Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed [c] the city. Therefore it was called Hormah. [d] 18 The men of Judah also took [e] Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron—each city with its territory. <br>  <br>   19 The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots. 20 As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak. 21 The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites. <br>  <br>   22 Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them. 23 When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz), 24 the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well." 25 So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family. 26 He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. <br>  <br>   27 But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land. 28 When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely. 29 Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them. 30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, who remained among them; but they did subject them to forced labor. 31 Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob, 32 and because of this the people of Asher lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. 33 Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them. 34 The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain. 35 And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor. 36 The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion [f] Pass to Sela and beyond.<br>  <br>  Judges 2<br>  The Angel of the LORD at Bokim <br>   1 The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, 2 and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this? 3 Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you." <br>   4 When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud, 5 and they called that place Bokim. [g] There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.<br>  <br>  Disobedience and Defeat <br>   6 After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance. 7 The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel. <br>   8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. 9 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres [h] in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. <br>  <br>   10 After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel. 11 Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals. 12 They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger 13 because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. 14 In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. 15 Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress. <br>  <br>   16 Then the LORD raised up judges, [i] who saved them out of the hands of these raiders. 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD's commands. 18 Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them. 19 But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. <br>  <br>   20 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me, 21 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. 22 I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their forefathers did." 23 The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.<br>  <br>  Judges 3<br>   1 These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan 2 (he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience): 3 the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo [j] Hamath. 4 They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD's commands, which he had given their forefathers through Moses. <br>  <br>   5 The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 6 They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	no|`|73n1SExgaa	Your thinking of the Canaanite's and that was because if they let them live as they did they would influence them into other gods. They didn't listen there either and they were. The Land of the Canaanites was the Land that God gave the hebrews. It is called Israel now. The Canaanite were gentiles that believed in many gods and didn't worship God the Creator the God of Abraham.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	you mean the Canaanites or the inhabitants at that time of what was called Paestine for a long time.<br>  <br>  Arabs where to the south in the desers of Arabia at that time.<br>  <br>  But they were all Semetic People and Spoke same familiy of languages.<br>  They all considered themsleves related, though enemies, if it was not for the new faith of the Jews that elevated them above others.|`|pemru8Ckaa	Muslims were never mentioned in the Bible.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	No, but they were told never to trust them.|`|T1beLIQqaa	No. The Arabs of Canaan are the Arabs of Palestine. They were there AT LEAST EQUALLY as long as the Jews/Israelis, but they had a constant presence and a defined land. The Jews were nomadic and had NO land until what was taken from the Palestinians in 1948. Both Jews and Arabs have the same father, Abraham, whom although Semitic, possibly Hebrew, was not considered Jewish. Abraham, his parents, and his ancestry is from Babylon, which is, in fact, INSIDE the Arabian Peninsula, the origin of the Arab peoples.So he may very well have been Arab.<br>  <br>  Palestine is a name which has been widely used since Roman times to refer to the region that includes contemporary Israel and the Palestinian territories, parts of Jordan, and parts of Lebanon and Syria. In its narrow meaning, it refers to the area within the boundaries of the former British Mandate of Palestine (1920-1948) west of the Jordan River.<br>  <br>  Palestine can also refer to the Proposed Palestinian State. <br>  <br>  The name and the borders of Palestine have varied throughout history, though Palestine has certain natural boundaries that justify its historical individuality. Other terms that have been used to refer to all or part of this area include Arabistan, Canaan, Greater Israel, Greater Syria, the Holy Land, Iudaea Province, Israel, "Israel HaShlema", Kingdom of Israel, Kingdom of Jerusalem, Land of Israel, Levant, Retenu (Ancient Egyptian), Southern Syria, and Syria Palestina.<br>  <br>  Early archeological textual reference to the territory of Palestine is found in the Merneptah Stele, dated c. 1200 BCE, containing a recount of Egyptian king Merneptah's victories in the land of Canaan, mentioning place-names such as Gezer, Ashkelon and Yanoam, along with Israel, which is mentioned using a hieroglyphic determinative that indicates a nomad people, rather than a state.<br>  <br>  The promise that is the basis of the term "promised land" is contained in Genesis 15:18-21 of the Hebrew Bible:<br>  <br>  "On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abrham and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates - the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites." <br>  <br>  The verse is said to describe what are known as "Borders of the Land" (Gevulot Ha-aretz). In Jewish tradition these borders define the maximum extent of the land promised to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac(2nd born-the Jewish lineage and Ishmael the 1st born and the Arab lineage) and grandson Jacob.Even according to Jewish customs, the oldest son, which is Ishmael, is entitled to the father's inheritance, but because Sarah despised Ishmael, she wanted Isaac to get the inheritance and had Abraham exhile Ishmael. Neither is Ishmael illegitimate but the legal son of his SECON wife Hagar-Genesis 16: "And Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abraham had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abraham to be his WIFE(my emphasis).<br>  <br>  The promise is made to Abraham and the descendants of his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob, Abraham's grandson as they are all given promise that their descendants will be given a territory from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates river.No where does it say the Israelis/Jews OWNED the land, nor were they to take it from, and, kill the Palestinians. The Israelis/Jews were given a land ONLY to reside in as many Jews already had among the Palestinians.God clearly states whom the land belongs to-"the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites." Of all these people, only the Palestinians whom are considered Canaanites, are still around. Except for Iran and Israel, Arabs own all of what was Canaan.<br>  <br>  It is Israel whom is illegally occupying the West Bank and Gaza strips, illegally building Jewish ONLY settlements and buffer zones from land stolen from murdered INNOCENT civilian Palestinians using machine guns and tanks.It is not the Palestinians cutting off power,water, food, medicines, and jobs-just HOW would YOU protect yourself from annhilation by occupiers if your government couldn't?<br>  <br>  BOTH SIDES MUST NOW STOP THE KILLING OF INNOCENTS AND RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER'S RIGHT TO EXIST. INSTEAD OF DIVIDING JERUSALEM, IT SHOULD BE SHARED AS A CAPITAL. ARABS AND JEWS ARE VERY CLOSLEY RELATED, SIGNIFIGANTLY MORE SO WITH THE ARAB PALESTINIANS.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, in Revealations, the city on the hill(that's Israel) will be brought to her knees for her indiscretions, which now seems to be the Palestinian situation.The world is growing angry with Israel's treatment of INNOCENT CIVILIAN PALESTINIANS and theft of their land in the West Bank and Gaza strips. Let's end killings on BOTH sides before we have to deal with WWIII.|`|td6WXhv4aa	It doesn't say that anywhere.|`|UinOWcMUaa	not found in the bible brother -- sorry :)

Otherwise they wouldn't feel the need to tell everyone about how great their stuff is, or how wonderful they are. I'm okay with a person telling me about when they get something new or anything like that, but when it's full fledged bragging it grinds on my nerves.

He knew exactly what he was doing when he created the universe and mankind.  No the designer did not intentionally add your so called bad designs for an unknown purpose.  The reason that you may see a poor design, is because mankind sinned against a Holy and Righteous God.  When sin entered the world, all sickness and disease entered the world as well.  That is why one might think that the world is flawed.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	I will play devils advocate, 1 No , life is too balanced,patterns repeat,physic laws don't stray,and humans will always take the easy way out. 2  Poor design = our view,omnipotent,benevolent= indifferent, a bumbler=When we make one better then we will have a contest,unknown purpose,bad things=again our view.PS> this side is hard to argue !

If the Principal will not listen...write a letter to the Superintendent of schools.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Go above the stupid counselor and teacher's heads and go to the principal. The teacher is an idiot and so is the counselor.|`|yf0tevyfaa	I honestly would let it go or talk to the teacher if it really kept bothering you. Sadly a lot of teachers or school staff do not treat students right and tend to get away with it. My sister has gotten sexually harrassed by a teacher before and the principal or counselor just blew it off until my mother had to go to the school and raise hell.<br>  <br>  Since it seems your parents won't be there for you, I would either let it go and be the more mature person in the situation or talk to the teacher and carefully word how you felt in the situation, but do not argue. Most teachers, if you talk to them, will apologize, especially if you do it in front of the class and calmly. My sister has taken this logic approach several times with stubborn and immature teachers and it has worked.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you  (:|`|lXpGlAm3aa	See if you can transfer to another school.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~talk to someone else~|`|nBkHjCFQaa	that was the short version? scared to asl for the long one.<br>  <br>  well you should talk to the principal or just dont pay it much attention its nothing to fuss about as long as your getting your diploma who cares about the rest. <br>  your counselor and teacher arent doing their jobs. counselors are supposed to help you and be supportive, guide you. teachers should grade papers and ask students if they want to help to grade paper or ask only the people who they can trust<br>  <br>  hmm counseling is fine, everyone should get it if they live in the US|`|uQSgesJ8aa	You can go to the principal, but if you can't convince him of there being some real issue, it probably won't do anything.  Say you feel uncomfortable by the way the teacher addresses you in class, and see if he/she will mediate the situation.  That will have more leverage than if you go to the teacher yourself.<br>  <br>  It would probably help to tell them about your parents.  Do you still live with them?? It's up to you, but know that they may be required by law to do something if you bring it up.

He then arrested my husband when my husband asked what we did wrong. We were fined several thousand dollars, not to mention the bail I had to post to get him out of jail.

6LYWanTRaa	I am very wary of any church that believes that they are the only way for salvation and if you do not follow their beliefs, than you will not be saved. From Pope: Only One "True" Church, "Pope Benedict XVI has reasserted the universal primacy of the Roman Catholic Church, approving a document released Tuesday that says Orthodox churches were defective and that other Christian denominations were not true churches.<br>  <br>  "...a 2000 document the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, "Dominus Iesus," which set off a firestorm of criticism among Protestant and other Christian denominations because it said they were not true churches but merely ecclesial communities and therefore did not have the "means of salvation." <br>  <br>  Pentecostals are similar in a way because they claim to have the only formula for salvation. <br>  <br>  From Speaking in Tongues: Is it Essential to Salvation? <br>  United Pentecostals and other apostolics believe that when a person is baptized in the name of Jesus that the Holy Spirit will come because it is a promise to you, your children, and other people that the Lord shall call (Acts 2:38, 39). Until a believer has spoken in tongues, they teach that the person is not yet saved. In fact, most apostolics would consider trinitarian believers who spoke in tongues to also be unsaved because they had not been properly water baptized and/or did not believe in the oneness of God. There are a few who will question the validity of a person's tongues experience if it is received outside an apostolic church setting.<br>  <br>  My belief is that we should be unified by sola scriptura, what the Bible says.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	I may not be as well educated as some about this, but I don't believe that the basis for the protestant reformation was objection to a pope in general, but rather to specific corrupt popes, and corruption in the Church.  Now that time has passed, the leadership has changed.  Of course, now that the new religions have been formed, they're not going to abandon them.  But there's no saying cooperation is wrong, if the pope and church are avoiding corruption in the opinion of the leaders of the other churches.|`|A8frjLzuaa	You are mistaken about Catholicism.

The Bible does not contradict itself when it is taken in context.  There are 3 dispensations of time in the one book, the Bible.  The law of grace, teachings for the Christian age, begins in the second chapter of the book of Acts.  Jesus lived and died a Jew so His life is the closing era of the Law of Moses.  Both Romans and Colossians teach that the old laws between God and mankind ended at the cross of Jesus when He gave His blood for the sins of the world.  Until the blood was poured out for all mankind, the world remained under the old laws.  Humans had no hope of forgiveness until Jesus died and, therefore, could not have begun before the cleansing blood was already shed.|`|AA10351261	I am Lutheran and if the Lutheran Church is considering any such thing-it's news to me.

I was young, but still an adult when baptized and I was basically lied to. <br>  <br>  NOTHING that is not faith promoting was ever brought up. Later on down the road when you are spiritually, emotionally, socially connected to this religion, subjects are brought to your attention (internet, work, etc) that you have never even heard about! <br>  <br>  It is hurtful to have happen to you and I hope to tell others the information that I was never told about.

I have found that the more active a non-mormon is in their own Church, (usually Orthodox Christian) the more they study their Bible.  But the problem is their interpretation of what they read comes from their Minister.  Which when compared to our LDS interpretation is nearly opposite.  And of course they are always right and we are always wrong.  Then with the ex-mormons, their main argument is that we hid many of our doctrines from them until after they were baptized.  Plus they totally believed everything they were taught in Church, not realizing that some things being taught are not doctrine, nor true.  And they did not bother to check for themselves as we are taught to do by our leaders.  So they become bitter and leave the church.  Then try to save other Mormons from the evil false prophets, leading the Church.  And because many of the "new doctrines" they have just found we teach, they again become even more disillusioned and hurt so they blame, not so much the Church, but the Mormons who belong to the Church.  Then they try to get even by trying to tell everyone they can what the Mormon Church really teaches, but wont tell you about.

I'm not against the Mormon people.  Also, I've never been a Mormon but I've probably studied the faith more than most Mormons.  <br>  <br>  Every religion is based - founded - upon its concept of God.  In other words, the doctrine of God is the foundation.  If the doctrine of God is incorrect, the entire religious belief system is flawed.  <br>  <br>  Mormons have, what I see as, an alarming concept of God.  It is most definitely NOT the biblical concept of God.  The God of the Bible is eternal and never changing, incomprehensible, infinitely above all creation, God in Three (Father, Son and Spirit) holy, a just and wrathful judge against sin, loving, but also exacting, compassionate, but also clear in His indictment against the sin of man.<br>  <br>  The Mormon God is essentially a glorified man.  Though it is not in the Book of Mormon I believe it was Brigham Young that stated, "As man is, God once was.  As God is, man may become."  In other words, God was like a man, and he attained god-ness.  <br>  <br>  This god of the Mormons - if I can say so carefully and yet intently - is an insult to the One True God.  The Mormon god is changeable, and far less exalted than God.<br>  <br>  From their concept of God, the Mormons take every biblical concept and twist it just enough to rob it of it's power to save.  They teach that Jesus was "A" son of God, and say Satan was too (Jesus was God's only Son according to the Bible - and not the physical son of a union between God and Mary as Mormons teach).  The Bible teaches that Jesus is The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  Colossians makes it clear that all things were made by Christ and for Christ.  To reduce him to the status of created being destroys the entire plan of salvation from sin.  Jesus, as a created being, is no better than you or I when it comes to satisfying God's judgment against sin.<br>  <br>  Where the person of God is corrupted, the person of Christ is reduced, the rest of the truth disintegrates.  If God is as minimal as Mormons make him out to be, then He is not so all mighty and holy and sin is not that big of a deal and hell doesn't need to exist, which means we really don't need a Savior.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but one more point is that any religion that ultimately puts any responsibility for salvation into man's court is false.  Jesus Christ's death and resurrection was sufficient - He offers the righteousness of Christ to all who will receive it and God is satisfied.  We simply have nothing in ourselves that can ever merit one iota of God's favor.  We are utterly dependent upon Christ, apart from anything we ourselves can do.<br>  <br>  How much more do you want to read?  There is much more I could say.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	well I love mormons tellign me why I left since they have never walked a mile in my shoes and I love mormons who say that the temple ceremony is online so go look it up, but, but, but it is all wrong so that doe snto make and sence at all. if it is online then why look it up, if the info is out there then it is not a secret right?

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It seems more likely to me that all of the religions that teach love and peace have bits and pieces of the truth.<br>  <br>  I've done some exploring and I think that Christianity, specifically Roman Catholicism, has the fullness of the truth.  But I would never be so arrogant to say that it was the one true faith in that all others were completely false just because they used different liturgies.<br>  <br>  God is too big for any of us to get whole.  I suspect that if we'd stop bickering and put all of our individual pieces of the puzzle together, we'd have a truer and clearer vision of who God really is.|`|93r3nCM1aa	The odds of religion are many...religions are very very odd.|`|FmazIF6Maa	We all can o0nly follow what we believe.<br>  <br>  I'm also Wiccan, but I don't feel my religion hinges on my being right. If I learn new information or believe new things I assimilate it, but I don't have to toss Wicca out the window. <br>  <br>  If someone proved to me there is no Higher Power tonight, tomorrow I'd still be Wiccan, because the rituals and the principles are meaningful to me whether there is a Divine Source or not.|`|AA10556726	From the gods that we know of, you have a 1 out of 3400 chance of being right in the monotheistic case (being very generous).  While I do not know exactly what god or gods Wiccans worship, I'd guess that the chances are about the same.<br>  <br>  Of course, we do not know all of the gods or goddesses that humans have worshiped over the last 200,000 years, so it is likely that the chances are even less fir both of you.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  We have indications that other hominids had some sort of belief system (gods, spirits, etc..).  If this is accurate then humans and their ancestors have had uncountable gods for over 6 million years.  This means that the chances of any god being the "right" one are worse than winning a lottery with one ticket.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Basically to compute the "odds" you need to take all the possibilities versus all the ones that you believe in (understanding that some do not allow belief in any others or claim to be the supreme "one").  So, we know of 3400 gods at least, this makes the "odds" 1 in 3400 at the best.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	all religions have a 0.2% chance of being true|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	IF what Jesus said was true, then there is only one right one.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	It is a tough question, for myself I believe that it is necessary for me to believe in a single true church, if not why am I wasting my time. The nice thing about my particular religion is that we believe that there is truth in all beliefs, just we have the complete truth, or as complete as God has revealed it I should say. Odds I don't worry about because the way I found out was to ask God and let Him answer if the church was true, He answered yes. After an answer from God what do I care about anything else, logic or otherwise.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I think the odds that *any* religion is right are really low. <br>  I believe in my spirituality because it is right for me, it makes sense to me, etc. If I found out that I'm wrong I wouldn't be too upset, I'd just accept it and move on. It would suck as my spirituality is important to me but on the other hand I do embrace and thrive on change.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	I'm an atheist...so....I really have no place to answer that...since I believe nothing, really, but science. And since it's based on hard fact, it would be hard to prove false.<br>  <br>  Moving on, religion is based on faith. If a certain religion was proved wrong, only a few would likely cease to believe in it while others would refuse to accept the evidence against them [and say something like, 'my god, whoever that may be, is just trying to trick us'].<br>  <br>  That's fine.<br>  <br>  But I have to discourage debating the truthfullness your religion with another's person who believes in an acutely distinct one.

nGyOmjPsaa	Haha, cute.  No way would God get mad at you for reading the Bible in abundance!!  It's not a sin.  I think you're in the clear. lol<br>  The people who told you that it's good to only read a passage a day are meaning that it's better to read the bible as Inspired Scripture as it is instead of studying it like a history book.  Just as long as you realize that this "history book" is indeed Sacred Scripture and inspired by the Holy Spirit.  It's more than just facts and funny literature, it's words from God and they are to be taken as they are...holy.<br>  But you are doing just fine!  Read along....just don't forget what you're reading and the authority that it has.  That is where the Holy Spirit speaks to us.

If anyone tells you that, run away from their teachings. <br>  <br>  Read Joshua 1:8 and Deuteronomy 17:19|`|40zewEkMaa	There is a reason you should only read one page a day.  It's so you can fully understand what you're reading because the Bible is so complicated and often difficult to understand.  And no, Jesus wouldn't be mad at you.

Ask it questions, Who are you?, What is your name?, Why are you here?, What do you want?, stuff like that but make sure that you give time for it to answer you.

OymrmDBcaa	Black magic involves the calling of supernatural powers to carry out a task on behalf of the caller.The words:"Oh, God the boundless one" , "The Lord thy savior" and "In the sacred name of the holy father" are not restricted to the christian religion. The proplem is that there is no testing,once you are in, you are in forever. I will advise you not to try it.|`|FmazIF6Maa	People have their own beliefs. Some people who are Christian and believe in the Bible believe magic is wrong. They believe it comes from the devil.<br>  <br>  <br>  I personally don't believe in the devil, so I don't believe any  magic comes from such source. I also don't believe in the black magic/white magic concepts; magic is neutral, a natural energy.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I agree with MSB. Wiccans and many witches don't even believe in the devil/Satan let alone do his work. We, as practitioners of magic, don't believe in the color code system either.|`|x4xaqrpCaa	Black magic isn't the power of satan. The church has lied and deceived us in order to get us to follow what they think. Black magic and white magic are both good. Black magic may just a little bit strong to be honest. Wiccan's used black magic. Egyptians used black magic. Alot of people in history used black magic. Besides, the bible was written by mankind. And mankind could be liars also.|`|dFBccLExaa	Because people are misinformed. Really, there isn't such a thing as colored magick, when you get down to brass tacks. Magick is neutral, grey. It's the practitioner that is the particular color. Not to mention, anything considered black is about things people fear- death, the dark aspect of all of us, the crone etc. Nothing evil about it.|`|AA10589890	Calling on God when you do something wrong doesn't make it right. Magic is a means of deceiving others and generally causing strife. Its false. That's what the word Satan means - Adversary.<br>  <br>  Adversarial influences (devils) are also made by God. They're there for us to out-do. We're supposed to be striving to make life easier for each other, not to make things more difficult. We have to practice to get good at it.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	because they think that anyone who doesn't agree with their religious beliefs is evil.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Actually, God himself spread that rumor. He did some black magic back when he was a teenager, but now that he's all grown up and 'oh, the Lord is our Savior' and everything, he needs to cover up everything bad he did. So he said black magic was the devil's work, so people wouldn't uncover his extensive research in it. <br>  <br>  Also, the reason some of the dark magic spells contain God's name is because those incantations really work, and have nothing to do with God himself. It is all coincidental.|`|b2528d457cd58cf870fc6327e2248294aa	Because Christians think that non-Christian stuff = evil = devil's work.<br>  <br>  I must agree with them, though, that black magick isn't always good. I don't think it's "of the devil" as I don't believe in their devil, but if "black magick" is being used to do bad things, it's wrong. Black magick usually isn't used or may be describing dark magick, which isn't bad, just has to do with the "darker" things in life.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	I don't even remotely believe in "magic" but it's a cool thought.<br>  People are probably just saying that because it's called "Black" magic, and when something is black like a black knight, or a black soul, it usually means its corrupt or evil.|`|TdROahUnaa	Because its not their religion.<br>  <br>  Plus. They think you might be worshiping the devil as "the lord thy saviour"<br>  <br>  Thing is... Christianity "invented" the Devil so it doesn't really apply to witchcraft. Its all them fanatics.|`|e7ee85fc90821767f2ddefaae94e5723aa	Lol! Because black magic is normally related to evil, thus the "devil"! I personally think its all a sham, and people are trying to screw with us!|`|pzY0ARqDaa	Because, its generally scary. It seems like Black Magic is something that the devil would be caught doing.|`|fRBZSVvIaa	They do not understand what they are talking about.
XKtjEiEraa	There are several religions that consider all magic as devil's work, just because it is different and so-called 'unnatural'. Christians will quote the bible's verse, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Simplified and out of context, that assumes that anyone practicing magic is committing a sin.<br>  <br>  There are many different views on magic, but a general view is that 'black magic' is spells that are performed with a malicious intent, the intent to harm and destroy, and 'white magic' is spells that are performed with pure intent, the intent to do good and to help others. Could you specify which book you are referring to? I think that might give you a better chance at several answers.

N3asaDRaaa	It's because Bob Marley and the beatles did drugs, and stereotypically, the hippies from the 60s and 70's generally did do drugs. People at school can be so stupid, so dont worry about what they think. just because you listen to GOOD music, doesn't mean you do drugs :)<br>  <br>  PS - Where did you get a Bob Marley T-Shirt from? I WANT ONE!|`|JXMVNEQoaa	doesnt matter, being a hippy is still degrading either way<br>  <br>  <br>  also its because in the 60s-70s most hippies DID do drugs|`|HrsPCzaBaa	1. Being a hippie is NOT about the music you listen to. Just because you flash Marley, or the Beatles on your Kohl's screen T's, or grace your ipod with a few of their discographies does NOT mean you believe what they believe, follow what they follow, or feel the same passion that they felt. <br>  <br>  2. Just because you enjoy listening to bands such as Marley, or the beatles (and others) does not mean you're a hippie, whether you like and actually listen to the music or not. As i said it's not about the music you listen to. <br>  <br>  3. Being a hippie does NOT mean you do drugs. Most people stereotype because it's easier than getting to know each individual person. Drugs are often associated with the 'hippie' generation (60's/70's) because a lot of hippies DID use drugs. <br>  <br>  4. Just cause you listen to that music, does NOT mean you MUST do drugs. As you said you enjoy it but don't do drugs. Like i said its all about stereotypes. <br>  <br>  5. You prove just how much you are NOT a hippie by asking this question. Excuse me for stereotyping, believe me i dislike doing it as much as the next person, but if you WERE a hippie you wouldn't give a Sh*t what people think of you, called you, labeled you, or asked you.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	I have plenty of friends that consider themselves hippies.  The reason they are associated with drugs is because back in the day they experimented with various substances while listening to (awesome) music.  There really isn't anything wrong, but since in the past they have been known to be pretty liberal with drugs especially weed it makes sense that people still generalize them as all doing drugs.  It's stupid but there isn't anything that can be done to fix it.  Just keep telling people that you don't do them and they'll just have to believe you.
PM808Qjkaa	Huuuuhhhh to the complaining white people.......<br>  In the history of histories white people, or European Americans, have been the most racist and aggressive people EVER!!! Now all of a sudden you guys (not all) want to start crying foul when the playing field is finally starting to level off a bit. Really?! Come on. You may have never said a negative thing towards anyone of any race, religion, or creed in your entire life but your race has, don't care if it was 10 or 2 generations ago-white people were racist and so alot of black people (not all) think that this is still true. it's a stereotype and it's one of a few- considering the many blacks, latinos, and asians have. It's dumb and it's stupid but it's there! It might always will be, especially for those who grow up in most-predominantly black areas, who never learn that this is not always the case, like I had to. Especially in the south and with the older generations there telling them what they know and have experienced. when we tried to explain to my grandmother and aunts that race is not as big of an issue (though still an issue) as it was for their generations in the case of Obama's election they tried to give us history lessons as if it's impossible for whites to like black people, because that's all they knew.Some people can't let things go, it's understandable.<br>  <br>  To the original poster.....<br>  Those people probably won't ever be your friend or they need some time to learn the truth about you, just be you and not worry about them. You can't change who don't want to be changed. Those particular people have issues. Maybe they just don't like you, and throw the race thing because they have nothing else! Eventually it'll pass if they want it to.|`|OOP6Hesyaa	There are a lot of black racists out there who think the way to fight racism against whites it to fight back with more racism. Many blacks (not all) do not want equality with whites, but to reverse the relationship so that whites are oppressed by blacks. I think white racism in the US and worldwide is growing, and the sad part is many people think racism against whites is acceptable. I recently spoke with an African immigrant who lives in Germany who thinks that all whites should be exterminated.|`|zF4LUzJcaa	Well not everyone believes like that, so yea(*_*)|`|KJhlt5yPaa	dont worry about it<br>  the more you worry the more its in your head<br>  just say:"i dont believe in races were all people"<br>  thats what i always say and they shut up about it|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I agree with what you are saying.  But...<br>  <br>  Are you especially nice to these people because they are of a different race?  You say you go out of your way to be nice to them so you may come across as treating them differently because they are not the same as you, even though you mean well.  You should treat everyone the same, not make an extra effort to be 'nice' to people of different races - if this is what you are doing then they feel like you look at them as some sort of 'special project' and not just a normal person or friend.  However, they may just be defensive or a**holes - not all people are nice.<br>  <br>  Just act the same around them as you do everyone else.  This might be where the problem is coming from....|`|AA10975334	Unfortunately with attitudes, there isn't much you can do,you cannot change the way ANYONE thinks, you just have to change the way you think I don't mean you are doing anything wrong, but if I were you, I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  <br>  when people are that way to me, I am kind to them, I am polite, but I won't go out of my way for them, I just respect them. After a while they catch on and will do the same for you. Don't worry about what others think, as long as you know you are in the right, don't sweat it.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Happens to me all the time. They seem to have a huge chip on their shoulder and there isn't much you or I can do about it. I had to leave a job I really liked because my three co-workers acted this way. I was the only White and tried so hard to just get along. Nothing was good enough.<br>  <br>  There is no way to prove you are not a racist and that's why they use it. It's too easy. You don't have to be White to be a racist. Something they don't seem to understand.|`|vTra7n5baa	The only thing you can do to be the better person is to tolerate  different people no matter what they believe.  The inner problem that you have is that you still think you have to "be nice to everyone."  I'm Russian and wish that more Americans would stop acting like this.  It's unreal and won't happen.  There is a belief in my culture that people are simply meant to be tolerated no matter who they are.  That's it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  You do not complain to them, be really nice to them, or engage them otherwise.  Simply exist and let yourself live your life without thinking a thought of them.  Focus on people you love.  That is all you can humanly do.|`|AA11282699	You cannot be friends with everyone as not everyone was brought up the same way.

That you owe me attitude is so unattractive isnt it?|`|lJHPiAa5aa	if its latinos or african americans its probably because i know a lot who can't stand white people who try excessively to prove they aren't racist and have that corny demeanor like "IM NOT RACIST I LOVE BLACK PPL" we like for people to be natural and be themselves act how you act when your with you best friends..that's the only advice i can give you.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	If you are white that is reason enough,welcome to the club.If not i don't know.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	People are just scared of what is different|`|PMR7RovEaa	this has happened to me so many times. let me guess. they're black? yeah. it really is hard for me to understand.

6f3fe02b641ca65408cbb81afbfee8caaa	My opinions of you are that, you look really beautiful.  You also look like a nice person.  It's all about your hairstyle and facial expressions.  Hairstyles create who you are, if you are wicked then it's probably a wild hairstyle.  For you it's all down with a curve on the forehead and a happy smile for facial expressions, this means you are a happy, nice person.  Also, my opinions could have no effect on who you really are, just opinions.<br>  Main Question: Yes, first impressions does matter!  You must look nice, neat, and most of all a good person.  For example, meeting a new boss, making a new friend, greeting a neighbor?  It matters a lot, otherwise they will have "opinions" about you !|`|DtotNQ3oaa	A girl. thanks.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	I'm not the judgmental type so I wouldn't really make any assumptions about your personality or character.  In this day and age presentation is everything.  I want to major in International Business and Finance probably working with various people and constantly making first impressions.  Since society bases so much on primary appearances it's important to make them a top priority.  Smiling is one of the best things you can do when you make a first impression, it makes the first encounter exponentially more amiable.  I'll try to think of what your first impression on me you would have if I just saw you, or in this case a picture.  While it helps that you do look pretty the best I can get out of it is that you could be an outgoing, funny, and interesting person to just hangout with.  Of course I could be totally wrong which is why I don't normally do this.  Good luck with your first impressions I'm sure you'll do fine if you just be yourself and stay confident.
d3VV4b6vaa	well......to be correct, fairies do not have wings in the sense because they don't have physical bodies..they are beings of light....But when they make their presence known to humans, yes some have wings.

GPznIhzMaa	I get the same thing! I'm Chinese and I get these stares ALL the time and they're usually from older Asians. I've even caught my mom doing it to other Asians. Whenever I ask her why she does that, she said, "I want to know if I know the person." Huh?! So all the Asians in New York are supposed to know each other somehow...? <br>  <br>  I know we were taught not to stare at older people, but maybe that rule goes out the window when the person is your age or younger than you.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	I have no idea. How do you dress? If you're dressed kind of hoochie they might stare like that. If not, I don't know why they would stare. Maybe you're just really pretty. That can make people gawk too.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	LMAO! I think a lot of Asians stare at other Asians just because there aren't that many here and we recognize them. It's like "Hey! I'm not the only one!" or "I wonder what they are (Chinese? Filipino? Vietnamese?)<br>  <br>  I guess I'm not the only one that experienced that! I'm Chinese, Thai, Filipina but I look more Filipina.|`|ry2XcFm6aa	yeah.. alota asian people are like that lol....mostly the old ones....sometimes they even say things in their language....yeah it happens to me too and some of em are just straight up pissed staring at you..lol...btw I'm Filipino too...I think they're just curious...|`|emvIYyufaa	I find that a lot of the time, especially in areas that are not very populated with asians, other asians may stare because they are curious about you and what race you may be or they want to make a conversation but they may not be sure if you are friendly, especially if you are another kind of asian from them. Some of them also possibly could be pissy because they don't like the way you look and/or make assumptions on you because you're filipino.<br>  <br>  I'm japanese and when I lived in a heavily populated asian area. I used to get stared at by a lot of asians (esp. older asians) that didn't like me because I was japanese and they'd make a point to tell me that they didn't want me around them. Sometimes japanese people even wouldn't want to associate with me because they thought I was another race. It's really sad to have people hate me for no real reason except their own preconceptions about japanese ( or whatever race they think I am) people.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, when I moved to an area with very few asians, I found that whenever I met an asian person even ones that were of other races, they wnted to make conversation and sometimes would stare at me before they decided to talk to me. One of my asian friends here said that he was reluctant to talk to me because he's chinese from southern china, I think and he thought I was japanese and he was afraid I'd be snobby to him.|`|pfke6Jieaa	hey u know what? i think ppl stare at someone when they look different. i spent a few months in the philippines and a lot of ppl stared at me. even when i went to japan and korea the same thing happened....lol. i just smiled at them and they smiled back and that was it. <br>  <br>  i know filipinos are asian but i heard a lot of east asians dont consider filipinos to be part of their ppl, at least thats what my gf said, who is also filipina. i got two kids too they are half iraqi and half filipino (girl and boy) and some asians stare at them too. i think its just cuiousity. but i also think they might not like filipinos too much cuz they are dark skinned. it could be either things i mentioned.|`|jXmiYzlOaa	OMG ME TOO! i'm asian {japanese} and a BUNCH of asians at my school (vietnamese) or asian adults, elders ALWAYS stare at me for a long time! <br>  <br>  my mom does this because she wants to know what ethnicity (NOT RACE) they are..just curious.|`|zF4LUzJcaa	They're just interested or curious bout you??(*_*)
8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	All I can say is if you're a squatter/hoverer, PLEASE make sure you wipe the seat every time afterward.  There's nothing I find grosser than going into a public toilet and it looks like someone sprayed the seat with urine from a spray bottle.  That's the splash effect from a "hoverer."<br>  <br>  Yes, I do sit.  I take a clean piece of TP and wipe the seat first (every time, twice if it's been sprayed), thoroughly, then I sit and do my business.  A toilet seat that is dried is no threat to health, and I shower or bathe daily anyway, so my thighs will be cleaner shortly in any case. :-)<br>  <br>  I used to hover when I was younger, but it's uncomfortable and makes a mess I have to clean up afterward.  I didn't like that.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I use the little paper thingys.|`|7bba2cecc3b8d0c8d7e003ceea9f79e2aa	Same here. Especially because most men are very dirty when they go to the restroom.. Nasty. ha ha

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	nan your not a vampire twilight just warp your brain now you role play as a vampire not good for your health at all just make sure you don't bite any body for real ok you will get your butt kicked for real<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|FwJLD1uDaa	do NOT use needles to drink your own blood. talk to your parents or doctor - vampires dont exist, and twilight is annoying.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Psychological... wishful thinking... adolescent desire to be different and feel "no one really understands me"... you'll most likely grow out of it. <br>  <br>  Bout 15 years ago The Craft came out and teens everywhere were online thinking they were "natural Witches" who could change their eye color and hair color at will and fly.<br>  <br>  In my day, everyone saw the exorcist and the Amityville Horror and thought they were being possessed. <br>  <br>  Trends...|`|LJkPRqN0aa	you are NOT a vamp....someones been looking into twilight too realistically.. plus.... one vamps dont drink their own blood, why? because they dont have any according to stories and other things that people READ. <br>  <br>  ps yeah i bite into meat and other things too that makes me a vamp.....geeze get a real hobby|`|Da1bmBQnaa	jump off u roof if u live u vampire<br>  also try<br>  reflection in a miror<br>  taking a pic of u self<br>  make u nose strate and put a spoon on it if  it stays u vampire if not u just have mental problems|`|Q93Nv8igaa	I Really Really think you need some help|`|KKh8rikGaa	Didn't we date in high school.|`|QkoRWKKyaa	where are you from?<br>  or rather, your ancestors...<br>  <br>  btw...<br>  join the club...|`|anfhcnWeaa	no one online can tell  you whether or not you are a vampire. we do exist so don't let the ramblings of these simple minded non-believers make you think they don't. the only advice i can give you is don't drink your own blood it can be dangerous if you draw to much or ingest to much also if you need blood that bad find a donor.or go to a butcher shop and get some cows blood stay away from pigs blood it's loaded with disease carrying bacteria that could kill you or at-least make you very sick.|`|4c7QomPoaa	1.

AA10031161	I agree- Racism is still racism, no matter which race it's "aimed" at.<br>  <br>  Scholarships that are given only to those of specific races...<br>  Hiring practices that are designed to reduce the chances of some because of their race...<br>  Government stipends given only to those of a certain heritage...<br>  <br>  I truly hope for the day that color, genetic heritage mean nothing, when personal achievement and skill, one's own effort mean everything.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	They are racist ,it's just they have special rights.They should be ashamed that they have special rights.|`|0MunIx8raa	I think that if it were in a different time before black people had the same rights as everyone else that it was necessary to have these things.  But now that times have changed and everyone is supposed to be equal, then no, I don't think it's right.  I think the black history month is just to remind everyone of what the struggles were and people who helped them through it in their fight for equal rights.  Now, BET, yeah, that's a different story.  Back in the day it was hard, very hard for anyone of color to get into college, so this was needed to help them out.  I think it should be re-examined now to be adapted to the times we live in now.  I don't necessarily think it's all racist at all, but I think some of it is silly.  Again, if black people weren't allowed on TV or not found to be common(like the way it used to be) then I could see having an all black channel.  Or even like the hispanic channels...I think those are ok, b/c it caters to those who do not speak english.  So that's a whole different issue there.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	YOu are wrong.  President Obama was not voted into his position because of the color of his skin.  He was voted into that position because of his intelligence, intellect, honestly, guts, courage, forthsyth and for the love he has for him wife and children.  They are an example of what a good family life SHOULD be all about.<br>  <br>  It is not white people that created Black History MOnth, for instance, it was black people that recognized the fact that many black people needed to believe in themselves, and have strength in who they are.  After all the years of racism that they had encoutered they needed occasions such as these to give them inner strengh.<br>  <br>  There used to be NO celebrations for the black people at all.    There are also celebrations for other ethnic groups on their special days.  East Indian people have a special day, Muslims have a special day. and the white "folk" have had every day surrounding them, at all times of the years.<br>  <br>  You say you are not racist.  Well, that might be, but since your belong to a church that has this deep believe that black people are less superior than white people and will not be treated the same way by "God" as the worthy Latter Day Saints.  Look into your Church History - Black men NOW ALLOWed into the L.D.S. Church (1967) because "GOD" had suddenly changed his mind.  Sorry, but I for one, do not believe that "God" ever changes "his" mind.<br>  <br>  Until early 1967, black children adopted into Mormon families, were not allowed to be sealed to their parents in the temple.  Because "they would never be able to get to Heaven".  I suggest you go into my profile and look for my answers regarding the Mormon Church and black membership.  There are more details there.|`|PoYFQ7Mxaa	It's funny that people think that now that Obama is president, racism no longer exists.  The pedestal that people put him on, both white and black, proves that racism continues.  I don't think he would have been elected if his skin were a bit darker, or if he spoke urban slang.|`|TwcAQPupaa	This is something that I've struggled with for years.  It does seem a bit racist to have organizations that only benefit one race.  If white people had something like that, everyone would be in an uproar.|`|7NLGPESiaa	This is racist thinking. Could you imagine "all white TV'.<br>  The NAACP would be in an uproar. Nobody had it worse than the American Indian. They weren't even good enough to be slaves. They were hunted and killed and sent off to reservations. They were in the way of progress. Just my opinion.|`|e46d2c3d2a60fbc79b6ad9ededf072abaa	Well, they are! I mean really! If they had the "White People Awards" everybody would have a $hit fit!|`|jnX9IsSXaa	right on my brother... right on... i don't care what anybody says... this is 100% reverse racism, from the 16 and 1700's and now...|`|frK3Tkeiaa	nope i am sorry..i am not racist either..but ur right,dude|`|sIIsWMElaa	no offense, but the Irish weren't here as long as blacks nor did they go through the same stuff. and while i don't care for black history month, (and im black), you saying its racist is funny. in case you haven't noticed, american history is extremely racist. thats why we learn about it. the reason why it was created is because whites refused to acknowledge black history with theirs because their history was wiped out. they then gave the blacks their version of black history. to this day who do you think runs these black history month events? rich white folk. instead of bashing affirmative action, why don't you take a look closely at it. the fact that blacks even needed this kind of help shows you the effects left on them. if you don't like affirmative action, thats fine, but you must understand that its there because of whites of the past. blacks were just given equal rights in the 60's. people say slavery was 400 years ago, but equal rights weren't given till over 40 years ago. what does that tell you? and things aren't equal. discrimination still exists o both sides, but blacks being the minority, which do you think is worse?|`|hHjPFxEdaa	How do you equivocate BET with affirmative action? BET is a music entertainment channel which came about because the mainstream music channel at the time, MTV, was not giving equal playtime to black music. The producer of BET is Viacom, the same producer of MTV so you should take your questions about it to them.<br>  <br>  Affirmative action not only helps black people it helps all minorities and woman of all races who had not had a fair shot at jobs or education because white males have always received preferential treatment. If affirmative action did not exist white males would still be getting preferential treatment.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	For everyone of those things that you mentioned whites have the equal right.<br>  <br>  BET-whites have CMT,VH1,TNT,USA,LIFETIME,OXYGEN,FOX,TBS,... CENTRAL, FOX, MTV.<br>  <br>  Black History Month-wwwaaaaaaaahhh, wwaaaaaaaaa, blacks get black history month! Whites only get 11 months out of the entire year.<br>  <br>  Ebony-well how about cosmogirl, teen beat, and just about every other magazine??<br>  <br>  Black scholarships-newsflash, whites have them too, however they are listed under ethnic group names like, Irish, Italian, Polish, British, and German<br>  <br>  Black Awards Shows-You have the VMAs, the MTV awards, The Country Music Awards, the Oscars, and The Gramys.<br>  <br>  affirmative action-I don't get any special treatment for being black. If anything, I have to prove twice as hard that I'm NOT a criminal. When it comes to a job interview, I have to prep three times as hard as a white or an asian b/c the company owner already expects for me to be an idiot. You want that treatment? I'll gladly trade it with you. Do you want to move into a new home and then someone ask you what kind of job you have to move there?(damn, you mean they could not ask your name first???). I'm sick of ppl thinking that if a black got a good job he must have gotten the job b/c "the white man felt sorry for him". I'm educated damnit and I will fight to make sure it pays the hell off.<br>  <br>  P.S. I hate BET. Please stop using that as an example. It used to be a good channel, it was created during a time when no channel showed black musicians and actors. So we created our own. When the channel was created it did just that. It showed good soul, REAL rap, and gospel music. Also black movies and news about our issues. It never shunned anyone else. Now, you get college hill, and gang movie after gang movie.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I know it shocks you to know that half of the blacks in this country can't stand BET anymore than many whites can stand to watch CMT(*GASPS*, *I AM SO SUPRISED*), yeah I bet you are.<br>  <br>  If I want to watch a predominantly black channel, I'll watch TV One and VH1 Soul.

92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	Even the Navy accepts people without any diploma and then gives them 3 years (one enlistment) to complete their diploma or GED. Tell him to wait until after october 1st when the next fiscal year starts, more money and more lenient recruiting practices then. Or, I would go see a recruiter in a different town or email one semi-anonymously and try and get an answer, ask them if he can enlist without a high school diploma and finish it while he is enlisted. If they say yes, what tier his GED is from is completley irrelevant if they will let people in without one altogether. Although, the job he wants might require a diploma i.e. electronics rates etc.|`|y4KXVvXkaa	the marines is the most leanent branch of all. something is not right here. they should accept him with a GED. maybe try and get it notarized or if he is that smart have him take a high school GED test at a public high school. I would try with a different recruiter also. I dont think that he would get a high school diploma being that he didnt graduate high school. They are called GED and High school diploma for a reason.|`|MhfneF0xaa	My son got a GED, and yes, it is a "non-accredited" diploma.<br>  <br>  Given the need for military enlistments just now, I think it probable that the USMC *will* accept your son, it just may need a little perseverance. <br>  <br>  My son was also in JobCorps, and I cannot tell you how low my opinion of this so-called program is.<br>  <br>  Work closely with your military recruiter, and good luck to your son.<br>  <br>  May he become one of the few, the proud, the Marines!<br>  <br>  Semper Fi!|`|65QqZBnjaa	You might get more answers in the military section.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I'm always yelling at objects, especially if they get in my way or grab my sleeve or something.  Or if I put them somewhere and they go sliding off onto the floor.  They must understand because they do stop whatever it is they've done to irritate me, at least for a little while until I have to yell at them again.  And they don't even yell back!  Or start to cry.  Although sometimes they will retaliate in some fashion.  I also tell the most repetitive offenders that they can be gotten rid of if they don't want to adhere to the plan.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Yeah I know the feeling when I get really annoyed at someone or something(like the toaster lol) 'cept it's different with me. I clench my teeth really tight and feel an overpowering urge to break something large and important. what usually helps me is lookng at myself either from someone else's perspective or staring at myself in the mirror 'cause i tend to look pretty stupid...then I burst out laughing...I'm weird that way. :)|`|QoOx93PPaa	Well, no. I consider that pointless. I'd feel just as frustrated, if not more so, after yelling at an inanimate object.|`|PTObqYcMaa	even though its always more fun to yell at people i do yell at random objects....often...like a chair when i fall off it i yell at it and stuff like that haha

I wouldn't give that much!<br>  It's fine to open a gift package, in some cases you almost have to, just to be sure it's undamaged when you get it from the store. When the recipient finds the gift card inside the packaging, she'll know you opened it to put the card inside. It's fine.<br>  When I buy something very fragile, I make sure it's intact before I leave the store. I pay for it, and then stand close to the cashier while I open it. If the legs of the crystal animal are broken, we deal with it then & there.|`|AA11449112	$50 - is very generous.  they can do a lot with that amount.<br>  <br>  in my opinion ... i would just wrap the picture frame and then get a card and insert the giftcard.<br>  <br>  I like to think that the presents that i get are new or unused.

BUT, unless you know you're going to live as a hermit or recluse without human contact, you're going to have to learn to deal with people and their idiotic ways, like a switch you can turn on when you need it.  1) If you don't want folk telling you all the things you need to do, make sure everything you are responsible for are already done so they have nothing to list at you.  2) If a friend starts repeating something he's already told someone else, you can walk far enough away so you don't have to hear it again; and if he repeats it to you, you can interrupt and say, "you already told me that!"  3) If people are not understanding you often enough that it irritates you, learn to slow down and enunciate so the can understand you the first time around, make sure you know the words you need to express yourself without any confusion.  And before you start to speak, you can warn them "I'm only going to say this once so listen up."  4) If they don't or won't listen to you, just shrug and shut up.  When they ask what do you think or for your input, just say that they obviously don't want to hear what you've got to say so why bother patronizing you with this "what do you say" stuff.  If they interrupt you, just firmly (not angrily) say, "PLEASE, let me finish my thought here."  Or "hey, I was talking here.  I don't interrupt you when you're saying something, I listen; you need to do the same."  A lot of the problem is that people are very rude these days.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	The extreme irritability you describe is not normal, even for a teenager.  You need a full physical exam to rule out any organic cause.  If you check out healthy, a psychologist or psychiatrist can evaluate you for depression.  Extreme irritability and anger are some of the symptoms of depression.  Fortunately it is very treatable and you can start feeling better soon.|`|cusngBDQaa	i hate it when i have to repeat things too . it happens almost all the time when i'm buying a bus ticket to somewhere or ordering food at maccas. it's not fair that i can't speak properly.|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	Why don't you just become a hermit,then you won't have these problems.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Fortunately most of this you'll outgrow, believe it or not.  But unless you want to put yourself through more pain and problems than you really need to, perhaps read some psychology about teenagers and find your "type" then use your own intelligence to make your life, and those around you easier.  Right you you are doing a lot of inappropriate things out of fear, and a need for attention.  It is pathetic, and you might recognize that to the extent that you'll want to act more mature, IF you understand why you do what you do.<br>  <br>  Guess what, sugar dumplin', you aren't the first to go through it, as much as you'd like to believe you are so special.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Uhhh,,,,,there is something wrong with you.  And you better figure out what it is pretty quick, if you plan on becoming a radiologist. Or any kind of doctor.  Your personality just won't cut it.  What on earth are you thinking, that you assume when you become a radiologist you won't have to talk with people???  What is going to happen when patients come in??  Are you going to use sign language???  And what about your employees????  Are you just going to have some sort of secret communication code with them??<br>  <br>  Really, you need to sit down, and really think hard here.  About why you get so angry, and what could possibly be that bad for you to get that angry.  You get lists, or told what to do?? Well, gues what?? When you're studying to become the distant doctor, you'll be getting lists galore.  So get used to it!!<br>  <br>  You've got to learn patience.  People are that way now, and they will continue to be throughout your life.  People will always interrupt you or they won't listen.  There's always those types out there.  But that doesn't mean they are ALL like that.  This is the one thing you've got to realize in order for you to be successful in your career and relationships.  Hang in there.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	You are afraid of people. Thats all.
Mzvp1LPFaa	Since the receptionist apparently lacked the authority to take action,  write a certified letter to the director with date, time, and names if  you have them.  Lay out the facts as they occurred, and request action.  If others felt as you did, get their signatures as well. A 9 yr old has no business at all in the women's locker room, and he should have been escorted out.  The fact that his mom was there is irrelevant. If she wants him to be able to dress around his sisters at home, that's OK. But it's not OK with the women in the facility.<br>  <br>  Call the director a couple of days after the letter is received (and signed for) or go in person to discuss the matter.  It is much harder to ignore  you  in person, and it is much more likely that appropriate action will be taken.  If  not, go up the chain of command.  The rules need to be clear and posted and enforced.<br>  <br>  If a boy of that age walked in on me changing I'd have told him firmly but politely that he was in the wrong locker room; the boys' is over there.  If his mom gave me a hassle I'd enlist the other women who also are disturbed by this and together we would tell them to leave (yes, I have done this).   Some people are so wrapped up in their own little world that they have no concept of the inconvenience or discomfort they are inflicting on others.  I wouldn't be unkind to the boy himself; the responsibility lies with his out of touch mother!|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Yep, it's inappropriate, so why not talk to the mother next time that happens.  Politely ask her to tell her son to wait outside.  It is completely inappropriate, and if you mention that you are feeling uncomfortable, she will probably understand.|`|KBaeecQzaa	yes, you're right<br>  i'ts innapropiate, I wouldn't want a boy to see my girlfriend without clothes (if I had a girlfriend)|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	yeahh doesnt your Y have a family locker room? because the limit is like 5 yrs old or something in our womens locker room|`|QoOx93PPaa	I do think that was inappropriate. The receptionist probably could have talked to the mom about it, though I somehow doubt that would have helped. Since it wasn't just the mom there, one of the sisters could have watched him outside of the locker room while the mom changed, and then they could have switched places. If he was about two or three years old that would be fine, but if he's that old, I don't think he should be around women who're changing their clothing. That's kind of rude.|`|kcai3gmHaa	At the YMCA I go to there's a family locker room for women with children.  The women's locker room is for women over 18.  So yes, I do think that it's inappropriate for a little boy to be in the women's locker room.  If your YMCA doesn't provide a family locker room then maybe you could suggest it.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	It is inappropriate at that age.<br>  <br>  I have a 9 year old son and I don't allow him to see me naked.  I'm not allowing him to see any other women naked either.<br>  <br>  I'm not a prude either - but I think there are some things that should be keep under wraps.<br>  <br>  Finally - if you felt uncomfortable the gym should have done something to make you feel better.  You are a member too.  Why should her lack of a baby sitter become your problem.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Definitely not. By the time my brother was 6yrs old he was standing outside and knocking. I too understand the presence of a two or three year old but 8 or 9 is way to old. Perhaps if you are terribly annoyed, I would be too, just complain once more. I saw a demented old man stumble into the girls' room and nearly hurt me. the YMCA too. they need to have tighter security around who walks around in there.|`|6f3fe02b641ca65408cbb81afbfee8caaa	A boy that young shouldn't be in the Women's locker room.  Talking to the receptionist was a choice, but it seems like she didn't do much.  You wrote that the boy was running around... was he looking at a women or something else?  It's probably okay if it's a 1-time situation.  It's kind of like for me, a girl with her father, going in a male's restroom.  It's okay, but if this keeps happening, its probably best to talk to them mother and tell her to keep the boy waiting right outside of the locker room, where as the receptionist can watch the little boy.  It's okay if you were uncomfortable, everyone is when someone that has the opposite gender of you, is in a one-gender room.|`|iCqfmRC3aa	I will agree that it was inappropriate for the boy to be in the room, not because other people were naked, but because some or all of those other people felt uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  I'm of the opinion that there is nothing shameful or naughty about a nude person of either gender and believe that we have caused a lot of problems by teaching children to hide and be ashamed of their bodies.<br>  <br>  This causes them to have body issues as they are growing up. But, again having said that, it is just bad manners to make others uncomfortable because of your actions.  So the mother should have asked, or assumed that the women in the locker room would have felt uncomfortable and, assuming one of the other children were old enough, had them wait outside, then change after Mom was done.<br>  <br>  On the limited information provided, I would complement the mother for her healthy attitude in not making nudity shameful, but I would chastise her for failing to consider the opinions of others.|`|AA11627889	I too would feel uncomfortable, children do tend to stand there and stare at things they haven't really seen before! So that would have been embarrassing for any woman if that happened. But even so a boy that age shouldn't really be running around a women's locker room,it's actually making me cringe a little at the thought of it. The Receptionist probably didn't want to approach the mother in case she embarrassed her, or in case the mother decided to create a scene. I just think that there should be family rooms available in more of these places. Same thing if a father had a 9 year old daughter with him, I don't believe that's appropriate at all if a girl was walking around a men's changing room!|`|vs5rK3iRaa	You were right to be upset.  The receptionist should be fired for refusing to take action.  The mom should be barred from membership for being a moron.  Someone, you or some other member, should have told the mom immediately that it was not acceptable to let her young ruffian loose in the woman's locker room.

7cjn2u9uaa	that is probably already the case since secular people will sleep with anyone.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	First, you might explain why you think this is a good idea.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|jard50Yiaa	Secularism is the assertion that governmental practices or institutions should exist separately from religion and/or religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  In one sense, secularism may assert the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, and freedom from the government imposition of religion upon the people, within a state that is neutral on matters of belief, and gives no state privileges or subsidies to religions. In another sense, it refers to a belief that human activities and decisions, especially political ones, should be based on evidence and fact unbiased by religious influence.<br>  <br>  The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely. In European laicism, it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization, and away from traditional religious values. This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official state church or other state support of religion. In the United States, some argue that state secularism has served to a greater extent to protect religion from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent. Within countries as well, differing political movements support secularism for varying reasons.<br>  <br>  The term "secularism" was first used by the British writer George Holyoake in 1846. Although the term was new, the general notions of freethought on which it was based had existed throughout history. In particular, early secular ideas involving the separation of philosophy and religion can be traced back to Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and the Averroism school of philosophy. Holyoake invented the term "secularism" to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief. An agnostic himself, Holyoake argued that "Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life."<br>  <br>  Barry Kosmin of the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism. According to Kosmin, "the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be epistemologically illegitimate, warranted by neither religion nor experience." However, in the view of soft secularism, "the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion."|`|ZvmwnLlfaa	I happen to think the real solution is the other way around! :)<br>  If there was no religion we would fight over everything else.

But its not because I want too, I guess you can say I have very good intuition. Like one time I was in the city heights projects with best friend who lives around there. Like I shouldn't be there anyways so I was in like a small store. I saw 2 guys who dressed up 100% gangster. It wasn't just the "look," I mean that’s the fashion now trying to be a "wanna be gangsta." So first it’s the neighborhood, look and then it was their facial expressions. Their eyes looked really saggy which I could tell probably did drugs. They just stood in the middle of the store randomly with their hands in their pockets with their hoodies up. They looked very dead serious and never said a word the whole time. So I'm a girl in a bad area and I see 2 guys like this am I suppose to be like,<br>  "Hey! Whats up?"<br>  To me there is a difference from stereotyping and intuition at judging at first sight. Another example would be I was at the theater yesterday and guys from the 12th grade came in. (18 y/o) Since their are police at the theater because of all the teenagers there. So this group of boys about 10 who very much stood out of the crowd were IDed. What would you think? The boys are going to cause destruction or shop for baby clothes? They put their feet on other people’s chairs and were loud as possible. Stereotyping is almost like instinctual to protect ourselves. Of course other people abuse intuition into racism.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Stereotypes are based on facts.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	when you personally fullfill the stereotypical action and do what they expect you would<br>  stereotypes are bound somewhat in facts, just not for everyone|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think it's a matter of culture<br>  for example....my family is part of a minority<br>  there are some so called 'stereotypes' out there, but in our opinion it's a fact. it's a cultural norm for us<br>  so in that case it's not a stereotype, it's a cultural norm

Your promiscuity is a result of your upbringing & you cant help that. Jehovah takes all those things into consideration & feels for you too.<br>  <br>  Please learn all about Jehovah's wonderful qualities & you'll realise that he forgives in a big way. Look at the example of how he's forgiven people in the bible (David especially) & you'll warm to him.<br>  <br>  It's now that matters to Jehovah, how you want to please him NOW. Just look forward not back. He doesn't look at sins of the past, he forgives & puts it far away from his mind if you are truly repentant. <br>  Please have a bible study & renew your faith & start attending meetings & you will feel much better about yourself & the future|`|bTA5ndeMaa	Not with the Wt:<br>  <br>  The main problem is not so much the sins people have committed as will you repent, turn around and produce works befitting of repentance and live a holy life in Christ.<br>  <br>  Read for yourself the verses preceding this one quoted here:<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:11, Darby, 11 And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<br>  <br>  If a person turns around and lives a holy life in Christ previous sins can be forgiven.  That does not mean that all repercussions <br>  may be avoided, or even discipline.  However, forgiven it can be.<br>  <br>  It is not our dead works that we did before we repented that count.  However, repentance does mean that fruits of repentance, works of repentance is a must.|`|PSk0zY5uaa	your not the only one sister............. <br>  if you are genuinely repentant (which it think you are) you WILL be forgiven.<br>  <br>  Remember David. He killed someone and committed adultery, yet he was forgiven and blessed.<br>  <br>  But remember you have to confess in order to be forgiven, if you haven't gone to the eiders yet i advise you do. Yes, it may be scary and embarrassing but they're there to help you and they are very understanding.|`|dYOpKvOCaa	You need to find real faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus will never make you fill guilty, nor does he demand anything more than for you to believe in him and trust that he will bring peace to you. Jesus forgives everything. There is not a thing in the world that you could do, that would take away the love that Jesus has for you. He will forgive you for everything and anything. All you have to do is believe.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	Quit blaming yourself and try to gain some understanding about propriety it requires some degree of flexibility . the world hasn't ended forget it and get on with your life . Just what are you afraid of anyhow?|`|AkFVoQlVaa	Not a Jehovah's Witness, but your actual husband would be the first one, assuming your testimony is valid, and that he didn't divorce you for the cause of fornication.|`|VQmHIrStaa	I believe the first step is to forgive yourself.|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Oh hon my heart goes out to you!!!<br>  <br>  Jesus said that the spirit is eager but the flesh is weak. He knows what you went thru and what you're fighting with. As long as you are repentant and trying to do the right thing like it sounds like you're doing: You're on the right track. <br>  <br>  Sometimes we have to learn things the hard way. It's sad but true sometimes. Just don't give up! James 4:8 says to draw close to God and he will draw close to you. Praying is a great start. I would also look for friends who will encourage you in your efforts so you won't slide backwards as much. <br>  <br>  Next, I wouldn't keep beating yourself up. Jehovah forgives and forgets we can do our best to forgive and forget too. That includes forgiving ourselves. If you can't let go what happened it will hinder you and your future relationships. <br>  <br>  Anyway keep up the good work!!!<br>  <br>  Ps I have a question tho: Why did you wanna ask Jehovah's Witnesses?
N3F4pi9paa	Yes, that is correct.<br>  <br>  Even the evolutionists have acknowledged that fossilization must happen rapidly - and can happen in hours. They also acknowledge that to make a fossil, the organism has to be buried rapidly. Now they would claim a local flood or sandstorm, but when you look at these fossil beds, they literally cover large portions of entire continents, and can be found on multiple continents - evidence that it certainly was no "local flood."|`|f0JLp4hFaa	Your assertions are false.<br>  <br>  A faith that requires lies for support is a weak faith.<br>  <br>  If your god isn't clever enough or powerful enough to create something as elegant as evolution, if your god isn't patient enough to work over billions of years, then maybe you should get a better god.<br>  <br>  I have nothing against Christianity.  But when you think of the Bible as an exact history and science textbook, you diminish your god to a few 2000-year-old campfire stories told by shepherds.<br>  <br>  If you work to understand the sciences that you so readily dismiss, you'll learn things that are truly divine and glorious.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	well, again this proves only one thing....<br>  need not finish as it is just rude.<br>  <br>  the fossils are not bones.<br>  they are imprints of the creatures bones.<br>  the majority of the bones you see in museums are replicas.<br>  <br>  now, your noahs flood.<br>  all that this would mean, if it indeed happend is that at some point.<br>  the earth had a higher water level.<br>  does not prove anything about noah or the bible.<br>  every society has its noah story and not all of them center around<br>  a guy who listend to god.<br>  some of them infact most were polytheistic.<br>  <br>  sorry kids<br>  try again|`|hbCs2X7Eaa	Dude study archaeology before you make such asinine claims. The theory is he died and was covered with mud almost immediately. Either by falling into a muddy bog or a tar pit or being covered by volcanic ash. A minuscule amount were preserved this way. A vast, vast majority (200+ millions years worth) rotted. TRex is one of the many life forms that make up our oil supply.|`|erRAnTBSaa	It always kills me when someone trying to prove the existence of God, Jesus anything Christian sites writings that are created by others who think the same way they do.  You are asking me to buy into what you are saying but only giving me proof from something titled GODtube!  Give me something that is not written by Christians and see if I believe.

That is pretty pathetic|`|AA11309061	this is why it has taken so long for scientists to come up with a the fossils record that they have come up with, which shows amazing transitional forms, because for a fossil to form the conditions need to be just right, a fossil is not bone, but rather rock that has calcified the bone, an animal must die in the exact right spot and the conditions must remain perfect for a long time for a fossil to be formed, this is why they are so rare, otherwise we would find them everywhere|`|5urfAbazaa	*FACEPALM*<br>  btw, you need to read up on geology on evolution.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Yep! It doesn't require tons of college to figure out what is common sense.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Your question points out why only a very few dead dinosaurs produced fossils.  Most that died simple rotted, were dismembered and eaten or or destroyed in countless other ways.  only a very few died in deep mud bogs, oil seeps, or in great sand storms that rapidly buried bodies in sand, or local floods that washed dead bodies into calm places where large amounts of sediment washed rapidly over them, or mud slides or volcanic eruptions that rapidly covered everything in a thick layer  of ash, etc.  Ordinary, everyday deaths generally leave no fossils.  But the fossils we find are generally embedded in rock that also records the rare catastrophes that produced the fossils.<br>  <br>  Keep thinking.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|LGBNKuxRaa	you appear to be hopelessly confused ("creationist"). the words you're looking for are 'taphonomy', not evolution; 'scientists', not evolutionists.|`|jR8mclWIaa	Bones don't rot because they are made of calcium which is a mineral.<br>  They turn to stone, thus fossils.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Fail|`|AA11815233	You don't know what a fossil is. Bones consist of calcified material which can last long enough to become saturated with minerals such as silica from groundwater, which turns them into a form of rock which can last millions of years. Did you never hear of the Petrified Forest?<br>  <br>  I suggest you get an education before trying to shoot holes in a scientific theory. Put the damn Bible down and read books on chemistry, biology, and physics.|`|ouXrNitMaa	"Rotting" typically requires oxygen. Being completely covered in mud shields the bones from the normal process of decay. <br>  <br>  I think if you researched the fossilization process, you'd understand why things don't work the way pseudo-scientists want you to believe. They're trying to use science to prove that their beliefs are not wrong. How ironic.|`|lQM8uH6daa	Why is it so important not to believe in evolution? Is your faith that weak that scientific discoveries would shatter it . C'mon, get serious. How would a bunch of bronze age men know anymore about God than you do ?

Much of earth was a warm wet bog which preserves. Floods (local not world wide) Your theory doesn't account for the location in the sediment that the fossils are found.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Werewolves do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.<br>  <br>  11. The idea that a human can shapeshift into a wolf or hybrid form is a myth only. There are no real werewolves. In order for a human to do this, it would require gross physiological changes, starting with a complete rewriting of every DNA strand in his body. Next, the skeletal structure would change, with rapid loss of bone in some areas and rapid growth of bone in others, with the attendent restructuring of muscle connections, tendons, and ligaments, a complete reorganization of every major organ in the torso, as well as a rerouting of the circulatory system. The dermis would have to suddenly, spontaneously grow thicker, and every hair follicle would have to be repatterned to grow fur. There would have to be a reallocation of body fat, and probably some loss or gain of body mass. Lastly, the shape, size, and function of the brain would change. This is most important - when you lose brain tissue you cannot regrow it, and even if you could, you would not regain the memories or functions associated with that tissue, such as what happens to brain tissue irrevocably lost in a stroke. If a man could change into a wolf, and then somehow change back (ignoring the fact that the excruciating pain from such changes would overload his system and he'd likely go into cardiac arrest and die), once he changed back he would still only have the mental capacity of a wolf, and be a drooling idiot at best, or a mindless homicidal maniac at worst.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	real vampire & werewolves do not exist if they did there would be a war between them right now in people all over the world would be dying in turning into a vampire or werewolf in it would be all over the news all the time people role play as a vampire in werewolf which is not good for there own health bite me in you get your butt kicked in go to jail <br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|wTMMG0enaa	of  course|`|BEoHK8V2aa	Actually, and I might sound crazy for saying this, I do think that kind of mythical stuff, can actually exist.

I for one am a half-werewolf.<br>  BTW:<br>  1. Werewolves transform every night, not just the full moon. However, the transformation becomes more intense and more wolfish as the full moon approaches.<br>  2. Werewolves can take medicine to help subdue the transformation - on every night except the full moon when the transformation is complete. This is why they only appear on the full moon.<br>  3. The werewolf can turn others into werewolves not only by biting, but also in the ways that HIV/AIDS can be spread - contact with body fluids. Also if one or both parents are werewolves, the child ALWAYS will be.<br>  4. Half-werewolves are formed by being turned by a half-werewolf or if your mother is bitten while pregnant and gives birth before the next full moon. (If the full moon comes and the mother transforms, the baby will be fully werewolf.)<br>  5. Half-werewolves can use the medicine every day because the transformation is never complete. So they can't be tracked.<br>  6. Werewolves were attempted to be eradicated before it was decided that they were human enough to obtain protection from the human rights. So now they can't be killed, just "displaced" to "secure locations". Of course, that doesn't stop some folk.<br>  <br>  So: no to vampires, but an absolute yes to werewolves. Take it from the experts.|`|RoFTfke3aa	depends on what you mean.  I am a werewolf so I can tell you yea werewolves real.

Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  The is a God, Allah almighty|`|AaVfzRamaa	No I don't believe God exists?

The Bible explains everything that we can't, such as life, death, heaven etc. Without the Bible, we wouldn't know our purpose in life. The Bible gives us information on God that we would not have known. There isn't really a way that one can filter biblical ideas and pick the ones that he or she desires to believe. This is an "all-or-nothing" deal.|`|gAl41HtGaa	I once believed that the great I AM was simply a myth I truly believed that it was a great form of therapy for those who couldn’t handle the pain of realty of this evil world we live in I was well versed in all the atheist beliefs of evolution, Darwinism, the big bang and all the other foolish rhetoric that nonbelievers hide behind.  I felt that we were free to live as we pleased and do as I wished without any repercussions as long as I was a good person and didn’t hurt anyone I was ok and didn’t need a God after all if there was a God why would he send me to hell if I didn’t hurt anybody (sound familiar) but one day came and as I was thinking of the love of my life my then two year old child in all my unbelieving wisdom I had an epiphany: how can a  man and a woman  create a life? I understand the science but how and why does it happen? The cells have no conscience thought, sense of smell, eyesight, or any form of guidance to speak of and when they do meet how can they join and make a life. It was at this point I realized that I can’t create anything and no human can, sure we can manipulate what is already there but we can’t create a new object from nothing. It goes all the way back to the big bang if you believe in it before the explosion where the matter comes from? What or who created it I believe that all of us atheist and believers alike can agree that creation requires intelligence now here is the hard one to wrap your brain around for any thing to exist something intelligent had to always exist or nothing would exist. On this very thought every lie that I held on to as an atheist came tumbling down and Gods fingered landed on every thing and I realized that God is very real and since he is real I need to live like my true father would have me live. Because if he created me then he is my true father and he is yours also.<br>  Since then I have come to find that even by the most unbelieving scientist, historians, and scholars the Holy Bible is held as the most historically accurate document on the face of the earth. An equally interesting fact is that the overwhelming majority of atheist has an extremely hardened opinion of the Holy Bible and Christianity but has never read the first page. I fell in this category I now realize the conflict lies in the fact that if we don’t want to know that we should have rules in our life and we should be held accountable for our actions.  As the good book says: <br>  <br>  1Jo:2:15: Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br>  1Jo:2:16: For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br>  1Jo:2:17: And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.    <br>  <br>  If you have any trouble finding anything in the bible or if you have questions about the bible please email me at straightisthepath@yahoo.com or look me up on myspace search for me with the same email address straightisthepath@yahoo.com I hope I can help thanks and God bless.|`|A4bQH82oaa	I believe in God, and I believe he created everything.

The Scripture says, "So [Isaac] called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day." (Genesis 26:33).  Many skeptics point to this and claim it's a contradiction, saying "who named Beersheba, Abraham or Isaac?"  My answer is this:  how does Isaac calling the place his father had previously named Beersheba constitute a contradiction? <br>  <br>  In other words, Abraham called it Beersheba and Isaac also referred to it by the same name. And so the Bible writer, in the second occurrence makes note that "...Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day." That doesn't mean that the name originated with Isaac. All that phrase tells us is that people continued to refer to that specific place by the same name that Abraham originally used, and his son Isaac also used. Nothing more, nothing less.  So it's not a contradiction at all.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  @ Enigma:  You wrote:  "By the way, Numbers changes it again claiming that Moses named it."<br>  <br>  That's completely incorrect.  Beersheba is in Israel, and Moses died before the Jews entered the Promised Land.

While this could be making some role their eyes right now... think for a second. If she is a cheater... and he is a cheater... then you are in a potentially dangerous situation because who knows if either one of them practices safe sex all the time.

I realize that they have their beliefs, and that some, for instance christians, believe that their is a need to convert us atheist. Other than the crazy hillbillies who tend to hate other religions just because they're different, most christians try to convert you because they truly care for you, and are afraid you'll burn in hell. As long as their not overly vicious about their conversion I fully understand their reasoning. In my opinion I think all atheist shouldn't try to insult/disapprove other religions unless directly addressed.

d7oz9FV6aa	I used to work for Landmark Theatres and it was a fun job. Orientation is just basically a run-down of your future duties in the film industry. What you should wear is basically what you would wear in an interview. You just may get the standard uniform that they provide, or you just may get it on your first day. Good luck and have fun.|`|nisfxpXHaa	Yes you got the job. I would dress business casual i.e. chinos and a dress shirt/top, no tennis shoes. I'm sure you will be given a uniform shirt or two. Job orientation normally consist of filling out all of your new hire paper work. I would bring you state id/drivers license along with your social security card.  You will probably receive some type of employee handbook. You will probably be given a tour of the theater. And have company basics explained to you i.e. schedules, pay cycles, responsibilities, time and attendance policies.<br>  <br>  I suppose they could start training you for customer service right away. But most companies break training and orientation up into different shifts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congratulations!<br>  <br>  <br>  L

c7TIjwzCaa	I've used Rossetta Stone to study French and Russian.  I can say that it is good software, but not as good as it should be for the price they are asking.  It's basically the instant immersion approach.  That doesn't mean it's easier than other methods though.  It isn't necessarily easy to learn any language, it takes a little work.  My favorite language learning method is Pimsleur.  Their method gives you a more comprehensive education in any language.  You can use their products to learn conversational skills, grammar, writing, etc - a nuts and bolts approach.  These are things that Rossetta Stone doesn't teach you.  Pimsleur also has a wide range of products selling for about $20 up to $250.  And yes, they do have Lithuanian.  <br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.pimsleur-language.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=SFNT&Store_Code=W&Affiliate=lemarquis72" rel="nofollow">http://www.pimsleur-language.com/Merchan...</a>|`|U6CF0Gh0aa	It's crap, in my opinion. Immersion is the best way to learn a language, but if you have to learn a language from a book or CD, use Langenscheidt, it's much better and it's cheaper.

But everyone knows - if they come to my house when my NBA team is playing - then they are going to watch the game with us.    We do turn down the sound and have conversation.    Our whole family likes to watch the NBA games too.    I really do appreciate it if visitors call and not just drop in.    I think there are two sides  to look at here.    It's highly unlikely, that I would shut off the Super Bowl - if I had a drop in visitor.    I have one daughter that can't stand the sound of silence.  She has been like that since she was old enough to turn on the record player.    If it were Christmas - I would play The Mannheim Steamrollers Christmas music in the background.  Birthday - no music.    As far as an invite - it would depend on the occasion.  DeeJay|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Me thinks people are no longer understanding how to socialize properly. I once read in Miss Manners, (so you know it MUST be so!) if people visit you unannounced, and you were watching tv, you are not required to turn the tv off, BUT if you have invited people over, then the tv is to be turned off when they arrive. This of course would be a dinner invitation or for conversation. I don't think this idea holds true though. I know sometimes when having someone over, the tv will give some reason to have some discussions. You know, like when you are sitting there searching for something to talk about...the tv can help in a case like that I suppose, but it is considered rude to have it on when invited company arrives. 'Well lah tee freakin' dah!' Added note: music is ok I think, as long as it is not so loud that it interferes with the conversation, but I see where you are coming from there Daisymae!|`|g7g0j6HTaa	I don't know its weird my neighbor keeps it on while she's talking.

After school she started studying to be a paralegal and after she finished they were to be married. Never happened. He met up  with an old girlfriend and  that was it. He and old girlfriend never married each other either. Our daughter was so angry about all this she wouldn't talk to her brother for a long time.

5JqCObDSaa	Bible Question: "In Mark 11:13-14, Jesus cursed a fig tree which had leaves but no figs, and verse 13 says 'for it was not the season for figs.' If that was the case, why did Jesus get so angry at the tree?"      Bible Answer: This is one of the clear cases where we can understand Jesus' anger when we realize He is speaking figuratively as well as literally. His anger was directed not only toward the fig tree, but also toward the nation of Israel that the fig tree represents.     When the nation of Israel was reformed in 1948 and recognized by the United Nations, they chose a fig tree for their national flag.     And to understand Jesus' anger, we have to know a bit of horticulture. When a fig tree bears fruit, the figs are first buds, and as the figs mature, leaves grow to protect the tender young fruit.     So when Jesus saw a fig tree with leaves, He could rightly expect to find fruit, perhaps immature fruit as the season for ripe figs had not yet arrived, as Mark 11:13 says, but some type of fruit. And when he found the tree had the appearance of bearing fruit, but no actual fruit hidden under the leaves, He cursed it as a hypocrite.     And that's a perfect symbol of the nation of Israel at the time Jesus was born into the world. They had a form of godliness, with the religion of the Pharisees, Sadducees and scribes being openly practiced in the temple at Jerusalem. But where was the reality, the fruit of godliness? Their religion allowed rejection of their Messiah.    The fig tree showed promise of fruit with leaves, yet had only the outward show with no fruit beneath. But the Pharisees were even worse. They had the outward show of religion, but they were really thieves, profiting from their positions of authority in the temple.     In Matthew 24:27, Jesus said, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness."     One thing you have to admit about Jesus. He didn't beat around the bush. He came right out and said what He knew to be the truth.     Or in the case of the fig tree, He cursed it and caused it to wither away. Which is exactly what happened to the nation of Israel, which ceased to exist from A.D. 70, when the Romans destroyed it, until this very generation today, which has seen the nation reborn.     When we come to God as repentant sinners, He recreates us to bear fruit. If we start bearing fruit, everybody can see that we are indeed what we say we are: trees planted by God in his orchard.     Jesus is quite adamant that to bear fruit, we must "abide in him":   John15: 1   I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.    2   Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.    3   Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.    4   Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Except the Christian version of Genesis is plagurised from the more ancient Ur, Sommerland culture and is much abreviated and mistranslated.

The sun promotes the fruit to grow, and the leaves develop later so the fruit will not burn in the Middle eastern sun.     A fig tree that sprouts leaves first, will not bear fruit.   "Bringeth forth its fruit in due season" is a fascinating  phrase in this regard.|`|NWopkX4baa	This story never made sense to me since it wasn't fig season. Why didn't he just make figs appear if he wanted them. Why kill something innocent.    Could you explain more why its like the Garden of Eden?|`|AoepHvNPaa	the tree was in his way and he was trying to show his disiples that nothing is imposible.|`|XwuZYLg1aa	No figs were not in season, but the tree in context was giving the signs of having fruit.  But although it claimed to bear fruit it did not.  Much like the religious people of his day (those at the Temple) who claimed to follow God yet were hypocrites (inwardly they were not relying on God).  A lesson for Christians today is that godly religion is not an outward show, but an inward reality that reveals itself in daily living.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	I have been taught that the fig tree always represents God's people.  He cursed the "tree" because it led onlookers to believe it was producing but deceived them.  He later goes to the temple and "removes" the money changers and cheaters.  He destroyed the wicked that were hurting Gods people.  When he said to the tree "Let no one eat fruit from you ever again"  he follows through in verse 17 "Is it not written- My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?  But you (those the fig tree represented) have made it a den of thieves.  I think that means he will harshly judge those that deceive others in his name.  And we have to be aware of the "fruit" of a person and not just their "appearance"

His lessons can be given during a Sunday Homily (sermon), Wednesday Audience (where he preaches over St. Peter's Square) or in Papal Bulls or Encyclicals, which are letters written to the churches and laity, just as the apostles did. <br>  <br>  Some audiences require tickets which can be obtained through your local Parish Priest, I belive others are open to the public, provided you can find a place to stand.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	The Holy Father lives in an apartment near St. Peter's Basilica, which is the cathedral you are thinking of.

uyn5d1dHaa	Religion was originally invented to suffice man's ignorance of the cosmos, supplanting both fact and theory with rhetoric and whimsical reckonings. Aristotle, himself, was guilty of this. However, this was wholly due to ignorance; this should not be an attribute of any citizen dwelling in an Age of Information.<br>  <br>  That said, my stance quickly becomes: Belief in a god detracts from the NECESSARY curiosity of the cosmos, forfeitting effort and desire for a Bronze Age publication filled with insufficient answers and half-truths concerning our origin and place in the grand scheme of things.It doesn't compute that believing in god, and accepting him on FAITH, could have any positive consequence for speculation and truth.|`|qcQm8eIbaa	I like this one.<br>  <br>  I think a belief in a higher being affects my curiosity because my belief gives me the ability to place myself in a place that is not here, on earth, at this time, with only these things to occupy my brain.<br>  <br>  When I wonder, I go ahead and explore. I'm going to do it enentually anyhow.<br>  <br>  I look at things from a more eternal perspective.

On one end, belief in God leads one to understand that He used science to do all of this and therefore the study of nature can be seen as an attempt to get closer to God, an act of worship, even. This is my category.<br>  <br>  2. Belief in God causes some people to shut down all thought about the physical world if they believe that the only thing that matters is what comes after death. These people readily accept magical explanations for everything in the Bible and tend to reject science as being anti-faith. <br>  <br>  3. In the middle you have those people who go to church on Sunday and to work the other days and never wonder or care where stars came from, if they ever even bothered to look up. They are those apathetic souls who plod through the motions of life knowing only that one day death will come along and change the scenery for them.|`|CueEJOVFaa	It depends on the belief.

It never hindered my curiosity.  Even when I still believed, my thoughts often turned to dissecting angels and even God to find out how they worked.

5GZmKz1caa	Yes... I gave up many opportunities to help others... I don't regret any of my decisions, I just wish that I could have done somethings differently... Now I feel that I aged past certain things and that time has past me by rather quickly... I'm 29 but the experiences I've had really feel as if they have aged me and that I can no longer achieve the goals I once had... I don't feel a a void... just a loss... and I don't know what or how to accomplish goals... or what I want to do anymore... i feel as if I live day to day... but for others still... my friends, family, co-worker... but not myself... I ask for guidance everyday... but still haven't found an answer or a path or whatever it is that I'm supposed to feel... I know what I used to want... but I don't know what I need... it's difficult to explain but if you feel that way... I'm sure most do too!!! Or at least I hope, I'd hate to be alone on this one!!! ha ha!!!|`|4UBC8hBoaa	a love life.|`|6EUOKBMDaa	No. Because i figure we all live and die so you might as well do what you want to do.|`|RPLsG63caa	not when u r truly Jehovah's servant.

I started to do things that are fulfulling to me, and that gave me something to look forward to. None of it involves religion. It all depends on finding my own happiness for myself, not relying on happiness to be provided to me by some other person (real or imaginary).<br>  <br>  Somehow I feel that you are going to pick someone who takes your bait, and proceed to tell them all about the "wonders" of Jehovah. Seriously, the world would be better off without people like you shoving their own beliefs down other people's throats. <br>  <br>  I guess I'm not surprised that all of your Q's and A's are private.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	Yes, there is something missing in my life, and it's certainly not religion.

Hjwp1yGWaa	Priests of Heathen Temples, no lie, all prostitutes were in the temples of false gods.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	How else did the guy at the dinner who warned Jesus about Mary's profession know about it?|`|VRl1jENHaa	There is no indication within the Scriptures that prostitutes worked for anyone other than themselves.  Perhaps you're confusing prostitutes with concubines?<br>  <br>  BTW, there were also male prostitutes.  See, for example, 2 Kings 23:7.  These men worked in the temples of pagan gods/goddesses.<br>  <br>  The Mosaic law required that prostitutes be put to death by stoning.  If a Priest's daughter became a prostitute, she was to be burned to death.
Hjwp1yGWaa	Obedience, Abel gave God his best, Cain did not.|`|wQJL3b3Naa	Abel was favored by GOD because his offering came from his heart or he offered with love. But Cain, GOD looking at his heart sincerity and love were missing thus, Cain was only doing it as a compliance. So GOD said I am with you in everything you do as long as you do them with love. THANK GOD; FEAR GOD; PRAISED GOD; GLORIFY GOD; HONOR GOD; LOVE GOD AND WORSHIP GOD|`|4DqtcnEmaa	Correct, both are in the Prophecy of the law of Moses.<br>  <br>  Grain offerings, and lamb sacrifices.<br>  <br>  What is important from the beginning is acceptance with God.  Also, God knows that Cain is jealous, but also He had known beforehand that Cain was a murderer of the first Martyr who was Testified about by Jesus from abel to Zechariah regarding how the righteous accounting for the Martyrdom of those accepted with God will result in the culminating birthing pangs of the Great Tribulation as written.  For God looks among the hearts of the people, one cannot serve Mammon and God.  Mammon is the demon of greed.|`|fLdv5pXLaa	He may have favored Abel's offering <br>  but he allowed him to die childless <br>  after only 7 verses<br>  while Cain had children and we are all (supposedly) Cain's descendants so who was the most important? <br>  Moses, Solomon, David, Elijah, Abraham, are all Cain's descendants|`|ylaGS5EHaa	It was more the spirit in which it was offered that was the problem. Abel offered what was commanded, Cain offered what he thought he could get away with, it would not be impossible for him to have obtained a lamb as he was told to.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	Abel brought the best of his flock, but Cain just brought some of his crop.<br>  <br>  In other words, Abel brought the best he had, but Cain did not.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	God likes blood, veggies aren't going to do it.|`|5XXna4C5aa	Because it was a blood offering......Like Jesus (Lamb of God)|`|AA10493307	The difference was:  Abel obeyed God, Cain didn't.  He, like many leaders in today's world, invented his own religion and was hoping to cram it down God's throat.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Cain didn't offer the best of the harvest.<br>  <br>   Hebrews 11:4   By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. <br>  <br>  But you know that already.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Abel's offering was the prescribed offering.<br>  Cain's offering was the fruit of his own labor. <br>  <br>  See Genesis 3:21<br>  "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."|`|8OeulLkmaa	Abel offered what God wanted for sin: blood.  Both Cain and Abel knew what God required because God started it after the fall of Adam and Eve.  God killed the first lamb to cloth Adam and Eve because they were ashamed.  It was the price for sin.  They both knew this but Cain wanted his works to make him right with God instead of trusting in the blood.|`|evStsOQiaa	Abel offered God some Grey Poupon mustard with his lamb chops and Cain did not.|`|67EaIAvbaa	because cain was like most of the people in here ( why they are here i have no idea)..he was satanic and twisted.

Sounds like you've been falling for the Hollywood version of it.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Every ritual in my group is followed by a healthy potluck feast.<br>  <br>  If by lovefest, you are referring to sex or those "wild orgies" some folks seem to think we have at rituals - then yes, that is a misconception.  My physical love for my significant other is reserved for the privacy of our own home.<br>  <br>  But love could be referring to the love we show in our rituals - our love for the gods, our love for the Earth and its life sustaining elements, our love and celebration of life, and our love for each other - like people show love to their families.  I can't remember a group ritual I've attended where I haven't received at least a dozen hugs - some of these folks, friends, I only get to see a few times a year, so the typical hug and "Hey, how's it going?  How have you been?  It's so good to see you!" kinda stuff happens, of course.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	That's a misconception.
lDEGaK7Laa	Probably the latter, if I really understood exactly what that meant.<br>  <br>  They aren't atheistic because they literally believe that Set exists in some form; their theism is one of the reasons that the Church of Satan doesn't like them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: They're Left Hand Path like Satanism and Luciferianism, and probably a cult, but I don't understand what you mean by the term "ego immortality." I'm not sure what the ultimate goal of Setianism is, other than becoming a god just like Set. If that qualifies as ego immortality, which I think it does, then, yes, they are an ego immortality religion.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Atheists don't have Temples. Immorality exists regardless of  any religion,  as all faiths have blood on their hands due to their long historic battle for supremacy.

(Revelation 21:5a)|`|3T50lwVhaa	Well, Rev. 22:14 is just a reference to the tree of life. The tree of life in Gen. 3:22 is a real tree that lets you know "the knowledge of good and evil." This passage is just talking about how people will inherit eternal life with God in heaven one day when you die.
2WnbP80Taa	man has always attempted to put a time on when creation 'happened' if for no other reason than to prove his point; but this cannot be done.  Carbon dating is not accurate in anything past 60,000 years, they will tell you they are accurate, but nothing is 100%.<br>  <br>  if we read Matthew 19, Jesus states "in the beginning it was not so" in reference to multiple marriages.  He also puts Adam and Eve at the beginning of creation, not millions of years later.  <br>  <br>  On the thousand years reign, the fallibility is not how, but when it has started or when it will end.  The Bible references many thousands of years in all the scriptures.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	No, the Big Bang could have been the physical manifestation of the events told in scripture. Also, the genealogy in Matthew is not meant to be direct father to son lineage. It is made to show fourteen generations between the big name figures and in the Hebrew a straight father to son relationship is not needed, so some are great grandfather to great grandson and so on.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	This made my head spin.|`|t6jNi6uxaa	The format of your question is very confusing, but I will try to answer the main points. The Genesis account does not rule a Big Bang at the beginning of creation. God spoke and everything came into being, that's a big enough big bang for me. As for genealogy that's too big a subject to discuss here. I therefore recommend you go to the free Study # 1. available at the source below, it should answer your questions on genealogy & chronology. God Bless
iHDYncuXaa	No. They are four different views of what happened. Say 4 people witnessed an accident. Each one would view that accident as similar, but in detail maybe just a little different.

Or when the husband is displeased with his wife (Deuteronomy 24:1-2)?    @ Fury Fiona: And you can make this claim how?|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	no, no contradiction in the bible because the bible is the word of the only wise God.|`|JqHkgWROaa	The geneology in Matthew is very different from the one in Luke.

Most of the differences are easily explained by knowing that each is telling the parts they remember. Taken together, we have a more full picture.     Some are not easily explained. Just because I don't have an answer, does not mean that there is not an explanation though.     I think if they matched perfect, then the criticism would be that they got together and "got their story straight".     One thing is obvious though. Jesus came, He died, and He rose again. That comes through loud and clear and the external evidence I've looked at agrees.|`|TMb076n6aa	No they dont they just balence each other. You also have to take in consideration the culture back then. Like How women where treated but Jesus stuck up for women.

I would never allow my children to not know who I was, or that I loved them. Even if one of my children turned out to be gay one day, I would never disown them, call them abominations or anything negative. I would love them no matter what. Even if they became killers that rivaled the raving lunacy of Hitler, I would still love them, I would just not approve of what they did with their life. I might go so far as to turn them in, try to stop them, but never stop loving, or wish them torture for eternity.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	i am loving to my kids so of course i would show them im real, its the manmade idea of this "all loving god" that would do the bad thing instead|`|AA10287804	I would torture them forever because it's my way or the highway...to hell.

Before you start  spreading misinformation, why don't you ask "what does this symbol mean? is it a tax?" before you make assumptions.     The "k" or "u" you see on food just means that the food is completely Kosher. It's no different from a  food product saying "may contain traces of peanuts" or "trans-fat free." Jews who keep strictly kosher will not buy a food product unless they know it definitely doesn't contain pork, meat and dairy, etc.     There is NO tax involved. It's so silly what petty lies people will use as an excuse to voice their antisemitism.|`|rThIVk2maa	Perhaps you might be interested in moving to a country where freedom of religion isn't so important.|`|1bubNOQmaa	The "Kosher tax" (or "Jewish tax") is a canard or urban legend spread by antisemitic, white supremacist and other extremist organizations|`|nisfxpXHaa	Stop listening to the white supremacist. No such tax exist.      L|`|eFnUBBxiaa	Whatever the tax is or isn't, we benefit as a society from it. 100% of us. Kosher food is much safer, particularly kosher meat. It's so ubiquitous that my Mountain Dew proudly sports the encircled U or the Hebraic K (don't have one handy to check).    Also, this isn't really an issue of religious forcing. There is NO government mandate. A company can choose to be Kosher or not on its own. If they aren't Kosher, then they save a bit in the short term but lose an audience. If they are Kosher, then they have to lay out some early money in administration and oversight, but then they get a whole new market. A lot of companies have opted for Kosher, so it may appear like some sort of conspiracy if you aren't aware of the above. Also, I don't see many Jews rioting in the streets because a specific product is not Kosher (and I live in New York City, so I think I'd notice).    Also, In 'n Out Burgers sports Christian iconography (crossed palms) and Bible passages all over their food wrappers. Doesn't make it any less delicious.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	There is no kosher tax. If a company wants their food to be certified as kosher then that's their choice.    Interestingly enough, Good Housekeeping found that people are more likely to choose food labeled kosher over food labeled organic because they have perceptions that kosher certified food is healthier...of course it need not be healthy at all though. It just needs to be sanitary and meet particular kashrut requirements.|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	Are you serious?  Can you really be this dense?  All that symbol means is that the food is Kosher and can be eaten by religious Jews.  It's not a tax!  God!  You people get more desperate every day!  But this one is just so paranoid!  Get a life!|`|f787da25adf88f5c9415340618993e18aa	I'm not even American and I know this is rubbish.    A foodstuff advertising itself as being kosher is only stating that a practising Jew can eat it safely. It NOT indoctrinating anyone, or taxing anyone!  It is no different to a food stating 'contains no beef' for Muslims, or 'contains no meat products' for vegetarians.      If you don't want to buy kosher food, don't. Its as simple as that.
qRx3ynKdaa	Avalon in some medieval Arthurian tales is the name of a magical faerie island off the coast of Britain.    Avalon is connected with King Arthur in some accounts of his last battle or his final fate, It is said that, though mortally wounded, Arthur was taken alive to Avalon to be healed of his wound by Morgaine the Fay, and that he would eventually return.    For the earliest accounts see http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geo... (and search on Avallon) and see http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/vm/v... (and search on Morgen.) For a later account see http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mart/boo... chapter IV to VI.    Avalon is comparable to the Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles of Greek myth, paradisal islands in the western seas. There are also numerous Irish tales of voyages to the west where paradisal islands are found, inhabited by supernatural folk.    The name Avalon seems to have something to do with apples, and apples are often a feature of paradisal islands in stories. In Welsh the same place is called Ynys Avallach in which Avallach seems to mean something like Apple Orchard or Appled.    The name Avallach is not Old English or (cutsy-poo ignorance!) "olde english in origin. It is a Welsh name. Yes, many monasteries had apple orchards. So did most farms. And there is nothing in Avallach that means water. ''Aval'' just means what it looks like, apple. The word Avallach is apple with an ending of some sort on it.    Arthur's body was supposedly found at Glastonbury in the year 1198, but that was probably a fraud. See http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/de... for an account by a contemporary. This find encouraged later writers to think that Avalon was really Glastonbury, and so accounts such as Malory's try to combine the tradition that Arthur was taken over seas and the tradition that he was buried at Glastonbury.    Note this Glastonbury connection is not found in anything written by Geoffrey of Monmouth.    Indeed, one medieval Arthurian romance called the Perlesvaus, Avalon becomes that name of the chapel in which Arthur is buried. See http://omacl.org/Graal/branch24.html, Title X and following.    Avalon was also sometimes identified with Sicily, and Morgaine the Fay was believed to live within Mount Aetna in Sicily.    Tales of kings or great leaders who never died and have been taken to a far-off paradisal land are not uncommon. The story is told of the patriarch Enoch in some Jewish texts and legends, of Ut-napishtim the flood hero in the Epic of Gilgamesh, prophesied of Menelaos and Helen in the Odyssey, and also occasionally told of other European kings and leaders.    There are also folk traditions of a king and his knghts hidden sleeping in a cave. The king is sometimes identified as Arthur.    I dont believe any of this is real, any more than I believe that Elvis is still alive, which is part of the same wish to deny that someone really has died whom we wish would have remained alive.    Note: the book the Mists of Avalon'' is a modern novel, and contains, as modern novels mostly do, lots of invention by the author.    Of course, the medieval tales were also probably mainly invention.|`|155e47baf8efe28f58e95f4efe9cf546aa	Possibly a real physical place but also maybe a spiritual realm like Faerie but it has nothing to do with Glastonbury Tor that was a myth invented by Geoffrey of Monmouth and monks.

gg2aJXoDaa	Smeg is a well known saying from The British TV show Red Dwarf. It was an expression of mild anoyance, that could be turned into an adjective or noun depending upon the context required. Use it in place of the F word.    "For smeg's sake."  "No smegging way."  "Smeg off."  "Oh smeg."    etc.    (The word comes from The medical term Smegma.

God is not a genie..and things may not necessarily happen overnight..what shall be done will. God knows your prayer even before you ask. He gives perfect gifts. I dont think that Christians are giving a misinterpretation on God's Word at all. Ask and ye shall receive. You have to dig deep in the word for your own understanding. You cant go by what everyone says all the time and you cant be concern with what otehrs say.Developing your own special relationship with God is a beautiful thing. God however created specail people for teaching of His word. I was suggest you read the bible and if you have more questions you should jot them down and give to you pastor and maybe he/she can give you understanding.|`|RQGzvXqBaa	Praying and asking for something specific is not about luck! its about whether you actually deserve what you're asking for or not. If you're following what God wants from you, if you are sure that your life has no sins,but plenty of deeds, then be sure that God will grant your wish in return. Just make sure you have time for God. Don't wish for something from him when you remember Him at certain times.|`|Xfhfz7wsaa	I used to pray more, but when I pray for anything, for myself, guidance or humanity, the total opposite happens.

If you don't know his name, you can't call on him for help.  God and Jesus both have Hebrew names and many don't know this.  In the bible, Jesus said ask in my name and it shall be received.  Well, use his Hebrew name.|`|FOZGMadaaa	God knows what is best for his elect. He knows what is best for all. So when we pray we ask,God show me your will. What is ones mindset. God said I am a jealous God. He is honest. Put know other God before me. We ask for idols and small g gods. God allows them and these things at times irritates us. God does not always give us what we want when we pray because it will cause us to be distracted. God has a plan for our lives and he does love us much. Just like children with their earthly father. We ask for things that may cause us harm. Even still God protects us,yet we learn a lot by pain,confounded,bad situations and issues that are unbecoming to a Christian like atmosphere. Pain brings about a gain. God said stay focused do not lose your crown.    God owns stuff. He gives us stewardship over his stuff. He said I give you everything. God owns the earth and the fullness there of. God is not lacking. Man is lacking. He lacks the wisdom and knowledge of God. Do you know God's intent. If we manage God's blessings and his will for others, the words of God and seek him earnestly. He will manifest himself in us. So we will know him for who he is.|`|YkQNSPdYaa	I prayed and I got my prayers answered. Praying is having a relationship with God. I pray to God whom I know loves me.

Hosea 9:14-16 (NIV) (this prophet of God is improvising a prayer to the LORD about one of the tribes in Israel that he hates!!!...) Give them, O LORD what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry. (The heck with any fetus consideration! By the future blood of Jesus Christ on the Holy Cross of Calvary, God rushes to answer him on the spot!!!) "Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, I HATED them there * (*the loving God HATES one WHOLE tribe in Israel!). Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them* (*God wont love this tribe of Israelites at all!); all their leaders are rebellious. Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit* (*I, God Almighty wont help!!!). EVEN IF THEY BEAR CHILDREN* (*these are innocent children of a Gods chosen, but rejected tribe of Israelites that are slated for a big gory slaughter. God usually takes it on the innocent children in the Bible not on the smart adults! Praise THE LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) I WILL SLAY THEIR CHERISHED OFFSPRING."* (*Yeah... the kids!!! The Bible writers are saying that God will have the kids killed!)    God always answers your prayer even before you open your eyes, but you must ask according to his will!  You get an immediate answer especially when you pray for the slaughter of Gods chosen people and their babies that YOU AND GOD HATE! And the Christians make such a big deal against the PRO-CHOICE people who really NEED an abortion!       Jeremiah 16:3-4 (NIV) For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters* (*Jewish babies) born in this land* (*not in cursed Egypt, but in the PROMISED HOLY LAND) and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: "They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth."      It is funny that prayers requesting the destruction of anybody especially children have an immediate and enthusiastic response from the Bible God, but prayers on behalf of a sick person like a baby may never be answered!  Even when IT IS KNOWN FOR SURE that God is the author of ALL THE EVIL in the life of the baby!    2 Samuel 12:13-18 (NIV)  Then King David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. Nathan replied, The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.* (*Isnt God so sweet? King David had sex with a married woman and had to kill her husband before he would find out that his wife is cheating on him with King David and now she is pregnant, but!) But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt, THE SON BORN TO YOU WILL DIE.* (*Yeah the Bible God in his infinite love always picks on the innocent and defenseless babies for a bloody slaughter, not on the adulterous parents Praise The LORD Sweet Jesus!) After Nathan had gone home, the Lord* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) struck the child that Uriah's wife* (*how specific can anybody get? Spiritually speaking, of course!) had borne to David* (*The Bible writers say that King David  is a man after Gods own heart!), and he became ill* (*God in his INFINITE WISDOM is slaughtering the baby so his enemies wont laugh at him! Gods IQ can be measure with the fingers of one hand!). DAVID PLEADED WITH GOD FOR THE CHILD. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground* (*Hardly any Christian today prays like that!). The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he* (*King David) refused, and he would not eat any food with them* (*what else can a decent guy do? Benny Hinn was not around yet to be of any help!). ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE CHILD DIED     YES! The Bible God, NOT SATAN had the poor baby dying on a slow tormenting death for 7 long days so King David and the enemies of God may learn a lesson.  WHATSOEVER is written in the OT is intended for the Christian of today, too! (Romans 15:4)    God the Son Jesus Christ is not less of a baby killer, either! Under Gods leadership in Bible times, babies and children were much more expendable than fetuses in abortion clinics, today!      Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Sweet Jesus Christ himself is the one having the pleasure of doing the killing of children so he can teach everybody a lesson on who is the BOSS! That is the theme throughout the Bible! The wise Clergy is earning millions of Dollars printing books about Jesus love for the little children of the world without telling anybody about Jesus vicious children killing craze. In our society today, Jesus would be in jail for promoting even BY EXAMPLE the killing of children to favor a particular religion!!!). Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*YEAH! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! He is such a great teacher and he must have learned all that from the Mafia! Or is it the way around?)    Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.    The Bible Gods down to Earth strategy is very simplistic! The Bible writers teach that the enemies of God or Israel for that matter ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them!    So good luck in your prayer life|`|8fp5dSW4aa	Prayers don't do anything. Taking action and donating money to a cause does|`|AA11282654	It's just one more reason things might be as they appear, and the physical plane is all we get.|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	It's a very good outlet, you can say whatever you like, as long as you don't swear, I would think.    Once I talked for a bit, it was OK, no really recieved what I said, writing a blog might be better.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Prayer doesn't work, no matter the venue or the request.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	Joh 14:13  Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.   Joh 14:14  If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.    Joh 16:23  In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.   Joh 16:24  Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.    Isa 7:10  Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,   Isa 7:11  "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."   Isa 7:12  But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test."   Isa 7:13  And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?   Isa 7:14  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.    Joh 11:21  Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.   Joh 11:22  But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."|`|of049X1waa	You're supposed to pray for guidance ina  situation.  It is cheating to have god do it for you, and even if he does it is kind of selfish. So I think that is just somehting people do for themselves, not because they're good christians.|`|AA11276208	God will answer pray in His time.  And he will answer it His way.  God has never left any of my prayers unanswered.  Sometimes it doesn't turn out how you expected, but God's will was done.  And yes, you are supposed to talk to God.  But you're supposed to repent, and praise Him and then ask for things.  That's last and shouldn't be the most important.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	It hardly seems respectful to use the Creator as a stockbroker ("Lord, bring me money") or bookie ("Lord, give me a winning lottery ticket") or lawyer ("Lord, let me not get a parking ticket") or team coach ("Lord, let MY team win") or pimp ("Lord, bring me a woman") etc etc.    The ONLY prayer I have ever seen that makes sense is the "Serenity prayer" that says:  Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference."  Armed with those attributes and strengths, it is then up to us and our free will to get what we need to live good lives and do good for others.    To petition for anything else is egocentric.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I John 5:14-15: 14)And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, He hears us: 15)And if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.

BE59y5E2aa	Your moon sign represents your female, intuitive, psychic emotional side.  The Sun sign - i.e. Leo, Scorpio or Aries is your masculine side.<br>  The two balance one another out.<br>  <br>  The rising sign, your ascendant is the hour of your birth that determines what house you were born into, depending upon approx increments of 10 days, determines how strong you are in the particular sign.<br>  <br>  Okay, I was born on September 29th<br>  <br>  My sun sign is -  Libra<br>  My moon is     -  Pisces<br>  My Rising sign is  -  Aquarius (based on 4 PM birth)<br>  <br>  Then you sit down and get a reading based on that...<br>  <br>  If you like, I could give you a brief reading, if you would like to email me with some basic information.  It will not be a comprehensive reading, but it will give you the basics.....|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	just so very very important that I don't even know was it is after I had my natal chart done for fun once killing time.|`|8qctM0B4aa	ive mooned so many people|`|94Bhw04iaa	One thing I've heard is that your Moon sign is what you feel inside, while the Ascendent/Rising sign is what you show outwardly to others -but all are important..Capricorn/Moon in Sag/Leo rising myself.|`|GQ6f2wSbaa	Jingles, you are freaking me out!

b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	Since I just turned 60, it's not so hard to imagine any more. Do you have an older sister?     LOL|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	I suppose I'm one of the lucky ones. On the 10th of February, my companion and I celebrated 30 years together. We were both 24 and knew the moment we saw each other that this was going to be something very special- and it has been. We actually saw each other (I know this sounds corny) opposite on a dance floor in a bar; dated for 10 months and didn't move in together until that December. And have been together ever since. So yes destiny does really happen!|`|mzhFrm5Taa	I don't live that way. I take each day for what it is..what's the point wasting your present thinking about the future? It will happen anyway so there's no point trying to figure out what will happen with your future because that will just waste the present time. So to answer, I don't ever think about that sort of thing.|`|4mkKoYn6aa	well it all depends in what way i often find my self asking if my knwing of someone will change because of how things are between classmates, to mates some thing are more solidly known that  will be with my mates for as long as i can be and even then <br>  <br>  thou with friends or people i just know its never a sure thing if they will be enemies within minutes or ages <br>  <br>  <br>  but yea<br>   these thoughts come alot when people piss me off also|`|MvmuZMG4aa	im really hoping that i would find someone who i can get along really well for the rest of my life but i doubt im gonna find that person|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	No.  I can barely imagine myself with one penis in me at a time.|`|jBTBMzPpaa	Right now, I can't.|`|NFUJAOtTaa	i see me and my bf together for ever till the end of time<br>  i hope|`|sSMegQBFaa	I have been with my girlfriend for a year. I could honestly see myself being with her for the rest of my life. She is everything to me, So to answer you question yes i can personally see myself with one person for the rest of my life, but that is just me, everyone is different. When you find that one person to be with you just know, without any questions.|`|SZdVYrSSaa	Definitely. <br>  <br>  There is no reason to keep looking if what you have is good. I have been friends with the same two guys (both straight) for almost 16 years now, and I can't hardly see myself getting through a holiday in my hometown, or a tough day without calling one of them and laughing for an hour or so.<br>  <br>  A relationship should be the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I think the whole idea of soul mates or fate is a little bit outlandish, and I think of marriage as more of a doctrine than a way of love, but nobody is perfect, and if you find someone who you are attracted to, who is kind, and has flaws you can live with, if you find someone you like as much in bed as you do at a concert or in a restaurant or sitting on a couch watching television with, then why not stay together? What do you think you are going to get that is better, great, random, mindblowing sex at 60?  I doubt it. A ton of really trustworthy, safe partners? No. Someone you know won't cheat on you the very next week even though they too can't picture themselves settling down? Prolly not.<br>  <br>  The truth is, dating sucks. You have to explain your quirks, your personality, all over again. And getting used to someone new, who is with you all the time is no party either, especially when it doesn't work out. Plus, you are taking big risks if you just want to go through life having random sex. So there is honestly not much of a benefit. I could easily see myself being alone forever, or with someone who I like enough to be with long term forever, but dating and hooking up for the rest of my life sounds like a prison sentence.|`|wn4k7EDBaa	i used to think that i wanted was love and that would be enough. but right now i am in a relationship where she loves me more then i love her. so at this point idk but i know that if i found someone that loved me enough then i could. but idk if they could with me. i hear i am pretty hard to live with lol|`|ds78ZSSRaa	I hate the person I've been with for 4 years, but I can't see my self with out him. Breaking up will feel awful and would take months but I would do it if I had to.  Or leave him for a sexy suga momma that could scrap my plate clean! get it!       So yes! one person at a time for the rest of my life.|`|qcQm8eIbaa	Sometimes. It gets easier the longer I hang around the dude.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I never want to see him again, but after all these years, he's still the one I want with me through tthe years.<br>  <br>  He's still the one. Who can make me smile.<br>  <br>  Course, when he's a dink...|`|af9f8af3a56d5bca6ce47e359dbb5c10aa	Actually I can, NOW.

Who Can?|`|OpduZC3Eaa	Sometimes.. of course that's when they're not pissing me off.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Yes.  I can be fiercely loyal and slow to change.<br>  <br>  My mom asked if I ever feel my life is in a rut.  I said, "Yes, but I like being in my rut."|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Yep, I can completely see myself being with the same person the rest of my life.  I honestly know the most perfect woman, I'd certainly be more than happy to be part of her life for as long as possible.  However, I can also admit that it's somewhat unrealistic to think that two people can stay together forever in this day and age.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Are you referring to the Act of Proscription of 1746 enacted by the British Parliament under George II following the Jacobite Rebellion, making it illegal for any Highland Scot to wear "Highland Dress" if  he was not in the British military.  The Act was repealed in 1782.  After a first offense, the wearer of either tartans and/or kilts was sentenced to six months in jail; the penalty for a second offense was transportation.      Of course, the Duke of Cumberland rounded up all the Jacobites he could find after the Battle of Culloden for hanging or transportation.   One of my ancestors, John Macquarrie, was transported to Virginia after being captured.|`|CJbSrsQdaa	Western barbarism|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	I think you are reffering to the Jacobite Rebellion|`|0aN1xIxfaa	Seeing as you haven't asked a question, it might be silly to offer an answer. So I shall just make a comment.    The Act of Proscription of 1746 (an Act of the English Parliament I think, making it illegal to wear Highland clothes i.e. tartan) was designed to subjugate the Scottish people. It was meant to take away their identity in order to have them merge with England and be ruled by London. A clan system operated in Scotland. This is what the English were out to destroy.    Well, the Act was repealed in 1782 and, clearly, it hasn't worked too well! In fact, if you see lots of men wearing kilts today; you can be fairly sure they're either English men (at a wedding) or Americans visiting Scotland! The clans don't have any real power but clan names and Clan Chieftans remain and there are stronger family ties and identity in Scotland than in England. Some Clan Chieftans still live in Scottish castles today, though others live in England and some positions are 'vacant'. The Gaelic language is also alive (if in a fragile state). Isn't it horrible, though, how dominant armies try to crush the national heritage of their foes? It's a form of genocide.|`|vCq6QRStaa	ok??|`|AA11634270	That's pretty hardore. Them guys weren't messing.
X1mE2eziaa	Yes. I have had a NDE. As a severe asmathic, my lungs locked shut and I went down. I knew I was dying and fell to the floor and with my last breath, I called to my Mother hoping she would hear it, and bring my nebulizer medicine. I leapt from my body, and rose above the ceiling and above the house. I could see through the house, all the floors, like glass. I could see my Mother using the stairs to get my medicine throught the roof of the house. I was on the second floor lying on the bathroom floor unconscious. There is a great deal to this story, more than I can write here, but I went through a black tunnel, and when I asked where I was going..I saw a Light in the distance. It was pulling me toward it at what seemed like a trillion miles per hour. The Light Being spoke to me, in languages not known on earth. the Light was Love, it showed no judgment. I was not at any point afraid, and I knew that there was no death at all, ever. I had a body that seemed to be made of Light or energy, it was not physical, but very responsive. When I thought something, it happened. When I asked something, it was answered. I was returned to my body when I saw from above that my Mother was pumping the nebulizer spray into my mouth. I worried what would happen to Mom if she realized I was gone, and not coming back. I acked for her pain. And so I was returned out of my Love for her well being, not my own, for I knew that I was alive and ok. I could not bear to see her agony by losing a child. The Light allows for these decisions where Love is concerned. I now know that there is no death. We are eternal, and the Light is God. I basked in the Light, absorbing knowledge and Love. I did not want to come back because I knew how hard it is to live in a physical body, and my new body was so wonderful. I returned a deeply changed, and highly spiritual being. I probed deeply into all religions to find truth, and I recognized for the first time, what Love really means. For the Light, is Love, in every sense of the word. And in it, lies all truth and knowledge. The Light is forgiveness. And it allows us in the afterlife, to judge only ourselves, and no one else. In that Light, I saw every truth, every answer, from beginning to end. I learned there, that ther is no such thing as time. Time belongs only to this physical world. It does not exist there. My new body was not prone to age or disease, and was perfect in the Light. I learned that the universe is a very tiny thing, not big at all like scientists seem to think. It is small like a grain of sand, and what lies beyond that is the most magnificent existion beyond our wildest dreams. All who have gone before, are there. I learned that we are al really ONE, all people, are one. It is only here on earth that we are fragmented. This is by design, so that we may see ourselves individually, and act upon our own will. This all happened to me over 40 years ago. I have not forgotten one instant of it. I cannot. While I was in the Light, I was instructed to answer anyone who has a question regarding this experience, and tell them of it. For the telling of this experience will bring each and every person who encounters it, into the Light, by memory at the appropriate earth time of passing. When You die, you must look for the Light, and you will know life, forever. God bless you.|`|fuPqQPvtaa	I haven't.  I have had several OBEs though.  While I do not know if they are 'real' or not, I believe they are because I had astral sex without knowing about it.  After that night I read about it...and it described exactly how it worked.  It is not as intuitive as one would think.  [don't mean to be so graphic, sorry] A tube comes out of the female's vagina and then the male penetrates  that tube with something that looks like a penis.  The act is almost instantaneous as well.  I believe OBEs are real because if they weren't then why would I experience something so strange as astral sex without knowing about it first?  I mean it's not how sex appears in dreams or how you would expect it to be done in hallucinations.<br>  <br>  I know it is far from solid evidence but it leads me to believe there is something real about it.|`|6d8cv86Uaa	I have a very interesting web site for you.

I wanted to know what the LDS community on Yahoo thought about Near Death experiences and if the church accepts them. It didn't really help. I did do a search on LDS.org from there materials and came up with an interesting one that some lady had a near death experience and from that experience she came back with a knowledge that the LDS church was the church that corresponded with her near death experience. That was interesting to read about.. I suppose they do happen. I've never had one. <br>  <br>  I've had a vision/dream once that I can only compare that was very similar to the experience that Alma the Younger had, which can be found in the Book of Mormon. But other than that, I can't say anything about having a near death experience.<br>  <br>  Edit: I watched the clip. It's very interesting. I think that it talks in generalities.

I also have see spirits all my life, and everything I ever wondered about all came together making sense about five years ago when my spirit guide made herself known to me. She was the one whom guided and protected me all the years of danger. She Erica came to my aid and stayed close guiding and communicating on and off for four years. She made herself known because my spirit was hurt, wounded, I would pray that the Lord take me and my son. God sent her, she and others came after that prayer for help and protection, also another prayer. She came or made herself known to encourage me, guide and help me with my son. She would actually one night pull me by the arm out of bed, I was to tired to wake, my son was ill, and she wanted me to take care of him. I seen her come out of my sons room once, but she always came to me, to hold my hand, rub my back, and hug. She is compassionate, gentle, and comforting. I don't see her that much now a days since she healed my spirit, but I know she is still there by my side. I too have astral projected and once traveled, and twice met Erica my guide, the first time we hugged and the second time she came to my aid as I battled a bad spirit, she came to help me. I was able to fight him off, because the OBE I had it was then spirit to spirit.<br>  The comfort and gentleness from her is something I never felt before on this earth, it's on a higher level.|`|YIElevidaa	yeah, they are hallucinations<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/churchofatheism/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/churchofatheism/</a>|`|mCbChkKraa	I died more than 100 times in my earlier lives.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	From a legal standpoint, in terms of Mosaic Law, Joseph's relationship to Jesus was significant.<br>  <br>  Joseph's genealogy is that of an in-law or "as supposed" as the scriptures typically say. And it's included to provide a complete picture.<br>  <br>  Tracing Mary's line, we find her father (Joachim) was a descendant of King David, and her mother (Anna) was descended from Aaron, the line of priests. <br>  <br>  That would make Jesus not only Messiah and God, but also a King and a Priest.<br>  <br>  Doesn't that make you feel better now?|`|XsTJPMHqaa	In adoption, the adopted child inherits all the rights of the family. Therefor, Joseph's lineage, as a descendent of David, was relevant.|`|AA10641825	Joseph was Jesus' actual dad, but God was his godfather.<br>  .|`|wuPTBIIuaa	my best educated guess is the "spirit of adoption" <br>  legally jesus was the son of joseph and marry because of marriage or "betrothal" . <br>  because Jesus was provided for by joseph. even though only a step father. <br>  but joseph was faithful to raising all of mary's children even the ones that were his own|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	It was recorded because it was a fulfillment of prophecy made to that lineage.

Jesus is referred to also as the son of David and Abraham. Joseph falls into Jesus' genealogy also as a Son of David and Abraham. You are applying a strict, modern usage of the term genealogy, and it is not quite applicable.|`|j4XiZccYaa	Actually, this was given to show Jesus' rightful claim to the throne of David. While he was a blood descendant of David through Mary, men didn't inherit from their mothers but from their fathers, and an adopted son was entitled to the full extent of his father's inheritance. Jesus was Joseph's adopted son.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Your thinking is cemented into earthly ways, this is why you don't understand heavenly things.<br>  <br>  The whole Bible from Genesis to Revelations is a book on salvation, and if you wish to include your name in the genealogy of Jesus then you must obey Him and believe in everything He accomplished to take all the sins of the world away (John 1:29).<br>  <br>  Here are books just right for you......if you order these Free Christian books on this subject then all your questions will be answered according to the Word of God.|`|QS6hSdZNaa	The then Jews never knew that Joseph was not the father ....but Jesus has to have a genealogy through Joseph to be accepted into the Jewish community....otherwise Mary  would have been stoned to death  by them according to the Mosaic law....and  every one knows Mary is innocent|`|91XGHfSaaa	Just because something is written down, that doesn't automatically make it "proof".

The term "seed" even referred to legal pedigree and not biological ancestry.|`|6PBgEf5eaa	I don't know I just don't know.|`|5SOKHs0paa	Reread those verses again; Matthew links the genealogy from David to Joseph, then Joseph to Mary who is then linked to Jesus. Luke begins the genealogy with saying that everyone believed that Jesus was the son of Jesus. Meaning they only understood Jesus's earthly genealogy.

Also think it means projecting ones self outwardly to embellish ones self with an image that can be admired but with no real substance in their own reality. As i read it i get the impression it verges on delusional and unconscious desire to impress & influence others of ones self. Is it embedded deep within ? I think it might be.It sounds like it could be.Any unconscious behaviour is in the maze somewhere.

What does that make me in terms of this question?  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and by the way, I don't "wonder", I KNOW why some bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.  They have very short life-spans, therefore, they evolve faster than most other organisms and adapt to their environments quickly.  They undergo rapid mutation and the generations of offspring become more and more resistant to a particular antibiotic to ensure the survival of the species.   That's why bacterial infections are difficult to treat most of the time.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	No, I don't wonder because I know why.  They already were resistant, and the antibiotics only culled out the ones that weren't.  Then, if you release the antibiotic resistant ones back in the general population, the don't do as well.  You see, they lack an enzyme that allows them to process the drug and kill themselves.  So, this is actually proof of devolution, not evolution.  Evolution requires organisms to add information to their genome, which has never been shown to happen, devolution is where you lose information, which happens with dog breeding, and antibiotic resistant bacteria and a host of other examples.  Good question, thanks for asking.|`|UkKEvilYaa	Actually it is de-evolution. The bacteria looses the gene that allows it to absorb the enzymes in the antibiotic that kills it. Evolution would be a gain of information not a loss. This process is called natural selection / adaptation.|`|yhTPcF81aa	We believe in Micro evolution but not MACRO evolution.

And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.

XwuZYLg1aa	I answer in the hopes of helping all with their faith.  Matthew does not give a specific prophet, but uses a generic appeal to the prophets.  One should approach this text with an understanding that Nazareth was small obscure and looked down on village and those that hailed from Nazareth were looked down on and despised (Note John 1:46, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?").  <br>  <br>  With that knowledge look to the written prophets and you will see that Jesus was prophesied to be despised and rejected.  More specifically Isaiah 11:1 says that the Messiah would come from a shoot (sprout) from the stump of Jesse.  Many look at this as a high point passage connecting Jesus to David, as it is written the idea is that just at David was from a menial family and was the least of Jesse's children, so the Messiah would be from a small unassuming family.  Interesting to me is that the village name of Nazareth means "sprout or shoot."  Matthew may very well have Isaiah 11:1 in mind as the prophecy.|`|FCzOjs7Jaa	Even as believers draw conclusions or try to explain the possibility that Nazarene may mean something other than one from Nazareth, still; it is unclear and man is forced to decipher or search for the root of this prophesy.  I cannot account for the books of the Bible that were removed from the Protestant versions and remained in the Catholic Bible, and there is so many other things that were removed or changed over time by the Catholic Church, the King James version, etc.  This in itself tells me that the Bible is not in fact infallable or divinely inspired.  Were it these things, there would be no need to reach at definitions or edit or remove parts to meet the needs of the Church or to change words so as not to offend the more delicately sensed, as was one reason for the King James revision.|`|jnNtIv8Laa	We read in Matthew 2:23:<br>  “and came and dwelt in a city named Naz′a?reth, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Naz?a?rene′.”<br>  The expression “Naz?a?rene” come from J17,18,22(Heb.), Nots?ri′.

One of the biggest reasons for the establishment of religion is to provide a set of rules for people to live by. Many people do not have the basic moral values that you do, and so they have to follow the laws of their religion to keep from doing bad things. Try not to be offensive, but respond to this question to same way that you did in your example. People can be stupid, and many have alot of prejudices against atheists.

However, I don't agree that most people believe that the only reason to be good is to please God.  For one thing, God tell us in His Word that we don't win brownie points or get to Heaven because of our works or good deeds.  In fact, the only way we get to Heaven is by His Grace and believe in His Son, Jesus Christ.      As a Christian, I strive to do good to help others and love all people because I honor my God and know this is what pleases Him.  It also makes me feel good, heals my own wounds and creates an innerpeace within myself.    There are many "fake" people...not only ones who claim to believe in God.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	I never liked that question/comment either. God's moral law is written on the human heart. You have to work at it if you want to deny it.     But I think when most people ask this they are actually asking a much deeper question that they don't have the words for. Not really about punishment or reward in the afterlife, but something like, "If this is all there is, why care about what comes after I'm dead?" or "What then is the ultimate source of morality? If it comes from society, does that mean that slavery was ok if society said it was?"    Trying to see an atheist's POV is a little like trying to imagine being Helen Keller for most of us. It is hard to imagine that people can deny the obvious like that.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	I'm good so his all might pastairian, the Flying Spaghetti Monster allows me to enter his noodley kingdom of saucy utopia.

Yes, when one depends on "God" for moral guidance, all other sources (including other people and even one's own conscience) become invalid, so the absence of God would create moral chaos in such a Christian's mind.  This particular formation of "Christianity" is intensely personal, so that the opinions, feelings and welfare of others are irrelevant to that Christian's salvation.

QYDYX9B7aa	Dude. I experienced a couple of WAY more freaky things than that. One time, I was in the bathroom at 2AM in the morning and a yellow towel hanging on the bar suddenly moved as if someone punched it. I HEARD a sound too like, "Pff" when that happened. I wasn't scared but I was standing there like wtf?????    The other time I was at school and working on a project due that week. It was like 2 AM again and I was in a chapel library basement doing my work. Outside, the lights began flickering for no apparent reason and went out. I looked out the window and there was a swingset with the SWING MOVING!!! Then I realized there was an old faceless lady like a grandma pushing a baby on the swing!!! I freaked out and BOLTED out of the room with a friend of mine!    Finally, one time back in my house in the basement I was writing a paper and suddenly the phone started doing weird things all by itself. It spoke a strange message I couldn't understand in a really strange voice and then said, "End of new messages." When I checked the voice message system THE MESSAGE WAS GONE!!!    I think all three times, demons may have been doing something!|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	Yeah, I walked into tech class and was like I feel like ****.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Some things, yes.

The simple answer is no, I would not bet that there isn't a god, in the sense of their being a higher power. Whether the god is a deist or theist god I will bet on. <br>  <br>  I am not only skeptical on the subject of Yahweh's existence, but I am almost fully confident in saying that there is no such celestial dictator. Through numerous loopholes, and inaccuracies, that exist in the bible, we are able to see that it is simply a book written by man. We participated in its creation, and we argued which books will be kept in the bible and left out.<br>  <br>  To put it in laments terms, those who blindly believe in the omniscient Yahweh do not know the facts involved with the religion they are exposed to. There are numerous other messiahs that were born December 25th of a virgin who had disciples, were crucified, and then resurrected three days later. Its all based on astrology. Its just a matter of time before the all omniscient monotheistic God is replaced with another figure.<br>  <br>  But as I said before, to bet my family's existence on the claim that there is so higher power, which would be given the title god, is something I would never do.|`|YieY5Ddpaa	You don't seem to realize how sure exactly people are there's no god.

You could actually learn about these people. They are people after all, despite what you appear to believe. What do you think Jesus would think of the way you treat these strangers? <br>  <br>  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<br>  <br>  <<RESPONSE>>:<br>  There are many atheists who act inappropriately on here. That is not my responsibility. I am responsible for my own behavior, just like you are. Despite the fact that you treated me with disrespect, I am trying to stay "civilized."  But, back to what I was saying... You should not meet rudeness with more rudeness, you should turn the other cheek, no? It doesn't matter how terrible everyone else is, it does not justify acting rudely towards strangers. <br>  <br>  It isn't about how you treat your friends, but about how you would treat your enemies. In this case, atheists are your opponents just because they disagree philosophically with you... not that either party would wish harm on the other.<br>  <br>  I hope you learn something from this question you asked. At the very least, I hope you learn about personal responsibility, and treating others as equals.<br>  <br>  <<RESPONSE>><br>  I feel like it was disrespectful to insinuate that because I don't share your beliefs that I am betting my family's life. It is obvious that your question was an attempt to make atheists feel guilty for not agreeing with you. You cannot simply guilt people into agreeing with you... it is dishonest.<br>  <br>  According to your profile, you are only 16. You are still young. Everyone makes mistakes, and I do hope you learn from this question. You already knew (or should have known) that atheists obviously care about their families. You need to understand... you are not the only person in the world. Not everyone thinks the same way as you. Just because people have not accepted your religious dogma, does NOT mean that they feel like they are risking anything.

You don't understand atheism to ask that.|`|SzqCD0G0aa	Actually read your question again reword it and apply it to yourself... this is not a simple yes or no question. Would you wager your daughter, son, mother, father etc on something you have no empirical proof of?  Oh wait you just said you wouldn't.  Yet the bible says you must put your god above all others, meaning IF someone asked you the same question "What you bet the lives of your family that god exists".... your answer would have to be Yes.<br>  <br>  I can't wager something that doesn't belong to me.  <br>  <br>  Do you wish to know the reason WHY people said yes to this question?  Because it's a question that is filled with sarcastic arrogance, so it was answered with sarcasm.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you're wondering how far some are willing to go for their "lack of belief in deities".<br>  <br>  I have seen the hatred and insults on this category from both sides, so don't think I am blind to whats being said. But you guys seem to think it's your deity or his supposed son that we are insulting. WRONG. <br>  When WE see christians refer to homosexuals as second class citizens, when we see christians refer to atheists as animals, when we see Evangelists scream hell damnation, when extreme right christians try and push laws based on the bible, when we see christians refer to peaceful religions and spiritual beliefs as devil worshippers, when WE see christians screaming "Godhatesfags" telling OTHER nations "they deserve to die in those bushfires" or screaming "your son/daughter is burning in hell" AFTER giving their life for christians right to free speech..... it is your god and his supposed sons "followers" we are insulting. <br>  Yes I know not all christians are like this, just like I know all Muslims aren't going to fly a plane into a building, just as I KNOW not all Germans should be responsible for the Holocaust and the deaths of millions of Jews, Russians, Homosexuals, Elderly, Handicapped, Gypsies, Romanians.<br>  If you think that you and your bretheran are the only ones being insulted, I would ask you to look again.<br>  <br>  You say you treat others with respect, how is your question respectful of people and their families.  Respect is earned Sir not automatically given.  Ask a loaded and arrogant laced question like this, you'll find little to no respect at all.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	It doesn't matter what I "bet".  Either there is an afterlife or there isn't.  Exactly what it might be if it does is anyone's guess.<br>  <br>  That said, I am not particularly impressed by appeals to emotion.  You are trying to use my feelings for my loved ones to try to lever some sort of concession from me.  <br>  <br>  My desire for an afterlife, or yours for that matter, will not change the fact that no one knows, and as things stand now, no one can possibly know if or what any afterlife might consist of.  <br>  <br>  As for certainty about the existence of a deity, the total lack of evidence for one is a big strike against it.  The same goes for your personal version of it:  You have no more support for your interpretation of it than any Muslim, Jew, Jehova's Witness, Mormon, Baptist, Quaker, Sunni, Shia, or Hindu.  <br>  <br>  When you come up with something that isn't purely subjective and is verifiable, give me a call.

As such it is more prone to religiosity as a claim to special status - many believers feel God has uniquely blessed the place.<br>  <br>  2) Ironically enough a state church eventually leads to less religiosity.  In a free market where religions compete for adherents, the more aggressively evangelical and most capable apologetist will gain and hold congregations better than a stale and largely unchallenged bureaucracy of a default faith<br>  <br>  3) The US has a large black population descended from slaves.  A religion based on justice and paradise in the next life is an easy sell to people treated horribly and kept prisoner in this one, and the black population to this day remains intensely religious<br>  <br>  4) While the US had some involvement in the two great wars of the last century, none of it was fought on their doorstep and their losses were not as great as Europe's.  Nothing is more likely to sap religious zeal than an entire generation of your young men dying in muddy trenches in truly horrific ways right in front of your eyes.<br>  <br>  5) Education system.  There is no - and I mean no - attempt to teach formal critical thinking or logic skills to normal K-12 schoolchildren here.  An inability to apply the rules of such subjects means gullibility is challenged less effectively in formative years.<br>  <br>  6) Politics.  The fundies here have been deeply involved in politics for decades here, pushing their regressive agenda and beliefs.  This has reached the point that we have special presidential debates about how religious the candidates are, and it is political suicide to forget to say "God Bless America" at the end of every speech.  This is more than likely a corollary of point 2 but deserves separate consideration because it does more than anything to keep the believers whipped up in pious outrage and solidify fundamentalism as a societal force.<br>  <br>  I was raised in Europe and have lived in the US for 20 years and those are the major differences I see.|`|QVKWVValaa	Europe has thousands of years of cultural development and enlightenment.

I think those two things might be a part of what is souring European society to organized religions and the like.

uuUd5Zidaa	If you do a little more research about what Saddam has been doing to Iraq that past 30 years, you can see why he was perfectly qualified by the Quran itself to be killed.    Saddam, ofcourse the infamous gas attack, killed SOOO many people.  My friend's uncle was kidnapped because he was religious. Thats why so many scholars and religious iraqies fled during the 80's, like Sayyed Qazwini.    Brother, the Saddam situation has nothing to do with Shia. Shia were oppressed and were hated against by Saddam. This whole concept of "usa would never have been in iraq if shias didnt cooporate with them" doesnt exist. Shias never had a voice, especially in politics.|`|v4SX9sbzaa	it seems that u worship saddam and if all of sunnis are  similar to saddam i should say sunnis aren't muslim because saddam was an animal.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Death of Saddam is justified from Quran.|`|C9KWIb5Saa	You're 2 years late.

But overall, he did a great job of runnign his country and keeping enemies out.  He also stood up for and defended Palestine alot. I admire that.     The part I hate the most (and Allah SWT, will know what to do with those who ordered his death)...is the fact that they hung him on Eid morning as if though he was a sacrificial lamb. This is wrong.    Muslims do not use human sacrifices. We are not animals.    May Allah SWT have mercy on his soul. With out him, his people have suffered.

He was never gay either.  He loved Jonathan because he and Jonathan had a very close loyal bond where they were driven together out of David's need to escape the wrath of Jonathan's father, King Saul.  Jonathan knew his father was wrong and helped David escape, even though he knew it meant that he himself would probably never be king.  In turn, David treasured Jonathan's loyalty and righteousness.  Later, after King Saul and Jonathan were killed, David took care of Jonathan's crippled son, even though there were others who wanted him to do away with all of Saul's family.

1ad5u4UFaa	Wasn't Jesus an initiate of the Egyptian mystery schools or something? He was a normal man, but through the way he learned to think and act he developed into a higher level of man. I believe that he was an example and when he was called the son of God it wasn't to be taken as him being the only son of God. We all have that divine spark and are all the children of God. He would be sickened to see himself worshipped. That's not what he was here for.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Doesn't make sense to me either.

If you personally know anyone who died and resurrected exactly as predicted by himself, then we can disregard Jesus. But there is not a single person in human history who died and resurrected from tomb. Now, please do know that if Jesus hadn't resurrected, there would not have been Christianity. Even his disciples hadn't absolutely believed that he was the true son of God. Even after witnessing mighty miracles performed by him, still they hadn't totally accepted his divinity. But it was after his resurrection and appearance before them, they totally believed him. It was then St. Thomas exclaimed "My Lord and My God". Jesus was God in flesh. His spirit is a part of God's own spirit.|`|0Dq30l5Saa	This is a good question, and the answer, in my opinion is quite simple.  Jesus is God in human form. It is said he is the "Son of God" because he was human, and God isn't.  It's confusing, I know, because they talk about him teaching of God, but I think that our minds aren't capable of understanding these things, just like we aren't capable to fully understand "forever" I think that God only allowed us to understand to an extent, so we will "Walk by faith, and not by sight."<br>  Good luck(:|`|qNWqdAclaa	Jesus said that He and the Father were One.

Because he the foundation of my life.|`|3SilRZzvaa	My opinion is that many people place so much importance on Jesus because they can relate to the human side of one they believe was also divine.  The divine is a distant, abstract concept while a personal savior who was also human touches the hearts of many.<br>  <br>  In the same way many christians seem to care more about the "Holy Virgin" and for them she is right up there with Jesus and god.  The idea of the holy family brings it close to home for simple, uneducated people. The Jews were a literate people and could read God's teachings and worshipped god only as an invisible concept. Paul and others wanted to appeal to and attract a wider following and so reworked Judaism to make it compatible with the teachings of the pagans who already believed in the human incarnation of gods. In a sense Paul took christianity away from the jews and turned it over to the pagans.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Just as those who believe in the teachings of Buddha are called Buddhists, those who believe in the teachings of Jesus CHRIST are called Christians.

So everything was in common.<br>  <br>  Ruth Aravah, JPA position ***Christians do claim the 10 commandments but not the other 603 commandments in the Torah.*** doesn't represent the Christian or Reformed Jewish positions.  As Michelle R says, ***Reform Judaism does not see the laws of the Torah as binding.*** (See more below.)<br>  <br>  The NT records:<br>  <br>  Eph 2:***11Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)— 12remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 13But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. <br>   14For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, 16and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 17He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 18For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. <br>   19Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, 20built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 21In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. 22And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.***<br>  <br>  Therefore, followers of the Jewish Messiah don't recognize differences between Jews and Christians.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 9 continues this idea:<br>  <br>  ***11When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here,[b] he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. 12He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. 13The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 14How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death,[c] so that we may serve the living God! <br>   15For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. <br>   16In the case of a will,[d] it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, 17because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. 18This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. 19When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. 20He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep."[e] 21In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. 22In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. <br>   23It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. 25Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 26Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. 27Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.***<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Cher says, ***Even on those though, there a difference that Judaism goes into details & analysing the hows & wherefores. Christianity approaches this differently & more generally.  The sacred book of Tanakh & OT are similar (Christainity adds NT), so the stories are known to both groups even though so much of the interpretations & ways or reading them are different...still some elements are similar.***<br>  <br>  Let's tell the whole truth, hmmm?  Let's not forget the addition of the Talmud to non-Messianic Jews as it was compiled and cannonized about the same time frame that the NT was.  <br>  <br>  Of course, I understand that the reasons you would not include the Talmud (oral Torah) in with the NT is because:<br>  <br>  1.   Non-Messianic Jews don't agree if it was from God or man-made.  How can you rationally explain how both can be right?<br>  <br>  2.  Why not call the Talmud (oral Torah) the second written Torah?  Obviously, if it is part of the Torah and written, the oral part of this Torah doesn't exist.  Talking about the oral Torah would imply something it isn't. <br>  <br>  3.  If it is a Torah, it has authority.  One can not say that the written Torah is greater than the written Torah.  What ever function the oral Torah had that the written Torah didn't was lost when the oral Torah became another written Torah.<br>  <br>  4.  As Michelle R says, ***Reform Judaism does not see the laws of the Torah as binding. They see it as a valuable religious resource, an important historical document (of debatable truth)....<br>  <br>  ....Reform Jews by and large believe in the Torah, even though not all of them accept the belief that it was dictated by G-d. And what they get from it is what is often summarized by the kabbalistic notion of "tikkun olam" - that the world is broken, and it is up to the Jews to make it better, by leaving it a better place than we found it. So the moral code of the Bible is profoundly important, but not in the nitpicky don't-mix-linen-with-wool laws, so much as in the larger-picture laws like: take care of the environment, feed the widow and clothe the orphan, do not be cruel to animals, seek justice in all things. Those are Torah values that are far bigger than telling people where your genitals need to go or what food to put in your mouth.<br>  <br>  ....While sin exists in Judaism, it is not seen as the conduit through which all religion travels to determine if you are a good or bad person. Rather, Judaism has commandments, and we are obligated to follow them, or repent. And we look to our rabbis to determine how and in what ways they are to be followed. So if the Reform Rabbinate interprets the laws differently, there is no dogmatic problem with their adherents following the law in that way. Sin has nothing to do with it - according to their own dogma, they are following the spirit of the laws. <br>  <br>  ....And from a big-picture perspective, where G-d's will for these current times is truly unknowable, there is nothing wrong with that.***<br>  <br>  The single issue that divides non-Messianic Jews and Christians is found in the last statement....***G-d's will for these current times is truly unknowable.***<br>  <br>  Obviously, it is also what separates non-Messianic Jews from the Jews recorded in the Tanach.  Messianic Jews and Christian pray that one day, the ability to know God's will would be restored.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2<br>  Apparently Cher failed to meet community guidelines and was removed.<br>  <br>  Ari said, ***i just spoke to my rabbi he said we want our book back***<br>  <br>  Why not work on getting to hear God's voice like the Messianics and Orthodox agree was possible in the Tanach and that Messianics say is still possible.

This corresponds to May 20. Tertullian (d. 220) does not mention Christmas as a major feast day in the Church of Roman Africa. In Chronographai, a reference work published in 221, Sextus Julius Africanus suggested that Jesus was conceived on the spring equinox. The equinox was March 25 on the Roman calendar, so this implied a birth in December. De Pascha Computus, a calendar of feasts produced in 243, gives March 28 as the date of the nativity. In 245, the theologian Origen of Alexandria stated that, "only sinners (like Pharaoh and Herod)" celebrated their birthdays. In 303, Christian writer Arnobius ridiculed the idea of celebrating the birthdays of gods, which suggests that Christmas was not yet a feast at this time.<br>  The earliest reference to the celebration of the nativity on December 25 is found in the Chronography of 354, an illuminated manuscript compiled in Rome in 354.|`|QoTfQfRFaa	Well silly ole me who just believes that if i ask and seek and knock like he says, then the door will open at some time. Since HE said if I have the Holy Ghost it will lead me and guide me in all truth (not that i would know all the truth that is to be known) AND well geewhizz since he's my father I just up and asked him one day. He told me he was born Dec 22.|`|a7BWdTeJaa	if we were told he was born in december, who are we to judge it differently. we will never know for we cant travel back trough time. even if he wasnt born in december it is still basically a day in honoring the birth of him. either way seems good to me. just like with easter, its a holiday to celebrate the resurection of christ.|`|7gVtQsOMaa	Congrats, you just flawed the bible, i dont keep a running count, but i know this is a new one for me atleast. i think im well over 10 discreditations of the bible<br>  <br>  <br>  'believers only' is an atheist magnet|`|qvYjVOawaa	I think its because christianity are influenced by Paganism - a religion popular at the time.

Historical evidence actually shows it isn't possible for Him to have been born at that time. Having to do with the fact it was winter and the shepherds were out grazing their sheep..i'm not sure somthing along those lines you could probably check that out. But I don't think it's wrong to set aside that day to celebrate His birth as long as we don't think that is an obligation to us and we have to. Because that would interfere witht the passage in the Bible that says "Do not add or take away from the bible." <br>  That's my view on it :)|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Decmber 25th was Mithra's birthday. Most of Jesus' story is taken from Mithra.|`|wVet0QXVaa	Well, I don't know that was actually Jesus' birthday.  It's the day we've all agreed to celebrate it.  I do think that sheep still need to eat in the winter, but I guess shephreds would have to take turns watching the flocks just like at other times.  To me, the point is that we celebrate Jesus' birth.  It doesn't really upset me that we might not have the right date.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	What do you not understand about this being an open forum?!!!<br>  <br>  Surely you lack the tolerance and intellect to discuss and debate on a public forum - so feel free to leave!!<br>  <br>  But why not stay, learn some tolerance, grow your intellect and in the process become a much better person!!!!<br>  <br>  Is your faith really so weak you dare not hear from non believers?<br>  <br>  If you have such weak faith why should anyone waste their time believing?!!<br>  <br>  A study concluded last year by theologians and historians based on the bible concluded the birth would have been in JUNE!!<br>  <br>  The church under Pope Julius I declared that Christ’s birth would be celebrated on December 25 in 350 AD in order to try to hijack the PAGAN festivals but it was largely ignored.  Christians did not really celebrate Christmas until 378 but it was then dropped in 381 and not resurrected until 400.<br>  <br>  America actually banned Christmas several times and is the originator of the expression  “Happy Holidays” which came about because of the pagan origins of Christmas to include all religions and traditions!!<br>  <br>  The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals. Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!!|`|UWKF7x4faa	The Catholics are right.  By placing the Christian holiday on top of a pre-existing Pagan one, if would assist in stifling the old belief system.|`|47l1Sumeaa	I like how you ask this question for believers only. That just attracts more Atheists. Lol|`|q6KmVWS1aa	First off-you're wrong its actually July or August when He was born<br>  Second-I don't believe that He was born Dec. 25th because  why would shepherds be in the fields in the winter.<br>  Third- I wasn't brought up in a way to believe such delusions.<br>  I think I celebrate His birth every chance I get, because He was born to die for my sins.  I wasn't raised to think that Christmas was about presents, it was about the birth of Jesus, although, I was taught that nobody knows exactly when He was born, nor when He died.  Although, he died in spring-Passover time!|`|Yx1kEsCHaa	Because as you said the used to worship the sun. At the end of December the sun would hang around the longest at around December 25.

wRdESMOOaa	See,first i'll tell you to be sure if he is 'completely' straight...for that,ask him frankly on some special day such as your birthday or friendship day(i know you CAN'T wait for so long,then why dont you arrange a special day for him when only you two spend a quality time?If he was your good friend,he would agree;say its just for one day and for the sake of your friendship)! If he says he is a bit confused or something like that,cheer up buddy...he might be into you! But if he throws out a blunt no,stay friends(if you can) but kick him out of your romantic utopia,howsoever difficult it might be.Because i know the worst curse for a gay is to love and lust for a straight person...that only ruins you in the end,leaving you miserable,pathetic,broken.Stay away from him and his memories,get new friends(if you wish to),develop a hobby,remember and think of only the bad things or qualities about him which you hated-this will help you in  forgetting him and please,MOVE ON...life changes,and it will,even if you try hard to stay stuck in whatever time warp.Take care and keep in touch dude....|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Ok..hold on to your socks gay friends....NEWSFLASH!!! He's gay too.  Sorry to spoil the jock party fantasy world that this guy is living in...He's spooning with you....Gay. He's holding your hand...GAy...He's dancing and sleeping(non sexually) with you ...GAY.  He's in denial and you need to step up and make him see that even if he's not GAY gay, he's gay.  I'm not saying throw down with the hot man loving, I'm saying that you and he need to talk and, all of these things just say gay all over and if he's as open minded as you say he is then maybe he'll give it a whirl.. Hell I tried it...wasn't for me... So why the hell not?    And to those of you who think I'm bashing gay people or making fun, I'm not.  I'm making a point.|`|01NUrwfYaa	first of all calm down! stop being so dramatic, honestly I think your damaging what you have by acting this way. your overwhelming him with your infatuation (I think love is something else)... but you may love him as a friend as a very close friend.. even more then a family member, but that is about it..     you have to sip some tea, mellow the heck out.. I know because I've gone through something similar.. and it sucks, but you'll be fine. don't f--- this up!!! he seems to love you very much as a friend.... it'll be okay. if you really love him, then you should want the best for him... like seeing him finding his significant other etc..    ... my advice.    >>> the way it's heading is down the toilet by the way your acting. love him as a friend.. and cherish the heck out of him but go no further!!!!!!!!    good luck, it is all you right now.|`|8x8bUMPQaa	im in the same situation.  i think the only way you can get over him ( if thats what you want to do) is stay away from him for a while    or ask him if he has feelings for you|`|ypVrHE1iaa	You need to talk to him in person alone! And ask him why has our relationship become strained. And you can hug him hold his hand and maybe lean in for a kiss if all goes well.. Personally I don't know of any straight man no matter how close the friendship was that would cuddle and hold hands with a gay guy... Thats just me though.. I hope all goes well in your situation!|`|9a2101ed2f6c0a177128332796fe6a28aa	"After awhile though our relationship became strained. Which could have been one of two things.  1. People assuming he's gay or making fun of him being so close with a gay guy started to bother him. As I said, he's extremely insecure.   2. He started to get feelings for me and that scared him.  I honestly think it's both."    This happened onece or twice to me, and i believe its mostly reason No. 1. Even if the guy is secure about his sexuality, peer pressure (people making fun of him being close with a gay guy etc) can have an effect on him, if he is just not determined enough to ovrecome that.    All i did were stay away from them. I know this is VERY hard as you were ONCE close to him as a freind. To be honest its the hardest thing to deal with.....|`|CcyRyb8vaa	I was in a VERY similiar situation. Honestly, from my perspective, it seems like he may have some feelings for you. But, his own insecurities prevent him from admitting it to you. It's a tough situation. If you all are really close, you might consider talking to him about, Not necessarily about having feelings for one another, just why the friendship has become strained.

HtBcGy1raa	In my world religions class, I was taught that some of those who practice Judaism feel that God's name is so sacred that it should not be spelled out fully. My teacher told us to think about this: Symbolically, what would be the meaning of throwing out say, a piece of paper with the word "God" on it? It would be metaphorically throwing away God. So instead of doing such a thing, they simply spell it "G-d." <br>  <br>  I think that the Jewish generally practice this, but perhaps those from other religions believing in the same God such as Christianity and Islam do the same.|`|RXBb8kx7aa	It's generally those of Jewish faith or whose sect is derived from a Messianic Jewish origin who consider it inappropriate and disrepectful to say or spell the name of God. Many times they'll replace the name/title of God with The Father instead. It's also commonly noticed in speech among them. They'll frequently substitute the title The Father verbally whenever reading passages of scripture or any other literature. I'm not of Jewish descent myself, so I may not have all my facts straight on this next one, but it's normally only acceptable to use his title in sacred circumstances such as during specific prayers or in synogogs (sp?) or temples.<br>  <br>  It's simply a religious belief exercising a form of sacredness in the title of thier diety.|`|8rvPgdSIaa	God is spelled like that.

It is an ironic twist.  <br>  <br>  It's fine that you're an atheist, but if you want to read about atheism, I think you'd be better off reading Daniel Dennett.  Dawkins is not good atheism.  I don't think people who follow Dawkins' line of thought make the world a better place.<br>  <br>  Based upon your usage of "delusion" and your question, I think you may have been heavily influenced by Dawkins.  If you don't believe in God, that's fine, but Dawkins worships himself instead of God.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in finding better meaning in your life.

0a3d9652bb748043fc60a999faa7068baa	OKAY. The guy lived many, many centuries ago, when Religion and science were good friends! Many people forget but we have Christian faith to thank for many scientific developments. Universities for example.     Back then Thomas thought you could "figure out" there was a God by only looking and examining nature (Natural Theology). Even though some people still think that way (Creationists for example), it is pretty clear in Christian faith that God reveals Himself to us and we can't get to Him by being inteligent. Karl Barth wrote a lot of stuff about this.    Today, Natural Theology has a new approach, and it involves the dialog between the "art" of theology and the exact nature of science, and what we can be drawn from this dialog concerning God, His Creation and life. I suggest you visit Alister McGrath's web site for more info    http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mcgrath/    Paz de Cristo|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Science is the study of things known and unknown.    Religion is the study of things known (revealed to us by God) and unknown.    So maybe that is why he sees a similarity.|`|AA12203324	Reasoning is not the same thing as science.  Reason and logic are non-discriminatory tools, useful for any discipline that wants to get from a premise to a conclusion.  The logical difference between faith and science is in the premises.  Faith has a different burden of proof for assumptions than science does, so it allows more assumptions to pass unchallenged than science does.  Once an assumption is accepted, logic can take over, constructing an argument just as strong as that original assumption.    Thomas did a good job for the time he was in.  The problem was that defined terms were often substituted for observation and experiment.  For example, if one starts with the qualities that a deity needs to exist, one can prove all sorts of things about that deity, even though you haven't actually shown those qualities to exist in reality.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	You are trying to view religion(the supernatural) as a subset of science(the natural). Science is actually a subset of religion. History as well as logic bears this out.

tfkpNh89aa	Priya - greetings!    Well you already know I'm not a muslim and this piggy eating thing does not bother me and no matter how many times muslim say pigs eat their own "poop" that's fine....  I know that the pork industry in the US is pretty clean...  I've been eating pork products since I was born and I haven't been damaged by it.      But - here is a true scenario for you...    Lets take a cow, sheep, lamb, goats and chickens.  NO PIGS....    These animals I mentioned all graze green fields.  While they graze, they pee & poop as they walk and continue to graze their meals.     Logically, all of these field animals eat their own pee & poop as well at one point or another while grazing.     I know you like to question, study and learn.  So, if you open you mind to all animals you will see that they all fit into the "pee-piggy-poop" eating scenario.    And lets throw the fish in the mix.      Fish pee & poop in the ocean waters.  They, -all fish- are continuously filtering ocean water through their system via food, crustaceans and plankton, which they too eat and drink their pee and poop.    Keep learning, keep asking and keep researching.  Regards,  *N*|`|Dimi8By2aa	Even if it can, no one eats it every week. I'm pretty damn sure that's not true, though.

It was also once believed that nitrates could trigger leukemia, as well as fluoride in the water.   As a Professional Chef, I must agree with God Bless. Pigs are actually quite a clean animal. One of the cleanest in the animal kingdom, in fact. Sure, if you keep them in a small, dirty pen, and withhold food, then a pig might resort to eating whatever it could find, which might include feces. Pigs, in their natural habitat, lived in forests, and were foragers, eating roots, bark and greens.   Chickens, on the other hand, have a weak digestive system, and constantly consume their own poop mixed with dirt and gravel, in order to help pass things through. Cows, do not discriminate between grass growing out of a cow flop, or "clean" grass. A male goat will eat the feces of a female, as well as drink her urine, as a sexual gesture, to prove that they are worthy of being her mate, and fathering her children. Sheep, on the other hand, drink the urine of the opposite sex, in order to "test" for impurities that might make the bloodline inferior if they were to mate.  Then theres the argument about pigs living in mud. Yes, too keep cool, as they do not have the same type of sweat glands as other animals. Mud in itself, is not "dirty."   I always here the "worm" argument as well. Well, trichinosis, is easily fixed with proper cooking. You cannot consume pork rare, or you run the risk of contracting it. Same as the risks involved in eating undercooked chicken. Salmonella is not a fun thing to partake in. Sure, worms are "yucky" but seeing as how most humans will have ring worms living in their intestinal tract several times throughout their life, without even noticing, it is not a solid argument.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Allah knows|`|g2CZi00Uaa	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL    omg haha|`|kItRaRmlaa	its disgusting and worms dont die.........check on u tube

Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this.

There is SOOOOO much influence to believe numerous things about God and whatnot. Also, a lot of people are born into religions that their parents tell them to go along with so therefore that's what they believe. Personally, I was brought up Catholic, but my parent's stopped taking me to church after we moved. In NC there are not a lot of Catholic churches. BUT I would go to any other type of church that wasn't "completely" corrupted. I can sit through a sermon and listen to what the pastor/preacher/priest has to say and I can take my own interpretation on what he's saying. Every church has their own way of describing God, but when it comes to me I (emphasis on I) have the choice to say what I feel about it.<br>  <br>  I do believe in God and I think my religion has gotten stronger over the last 2 years. I also don't believe that you don't need to go to church to be religious. <br>  <br>  <br>  And I also respect every single religion out there. I don't care if your Buddhist, Muslim, Christian or whatever--as long as you believe in SOMETHING then I'm fine. It's the people who "don't know" that bother me. I have no problem with Atheists either. Atleast they believe NOT to believe. I can respect that.|`|7tJNspGNaa	I think that a personal belief in god has the ability to be a personal choice, but there are a lot of people in the world that haven't yet been exposed to alternate options.<br>  One of the key points in religion is that god cannot be questioned, and so fear keeps everyone inside of a little religious box. People that wish to be accepted and rewarded by their religion will never question, and they have been taught to stand by their religion with everything they have - or else god will fail them in final judgment (as they failed him in life). <br>  <br>  I believe that "god" is merely the system we live in, and the force that enables us to have life. It is the air we breathe, and the joy we have. I think nature is above everything, and there is no force that could bend it.<br>  I chose to abandon my (forced) Catholic belief system when I was 11 years old after the suicide of my best friend. I could not understand this 'plan' that god had. I had known suffering for my entire life, and I "got mad at god" as some people say... and left the religion. How could someone so powerful as god allow such suffering to happen? Because we have free will? That just seemed like some either A. Messed up plan or B. A plan that doesn't have much planning involved.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the inconsistencies of the church, and the idea we must worship for salvation. If I found there is a god as portrayed by the Catholic church, I would continue to refuse to serve.|`|AztCTaQlaa	If you're lucky it's a choice. the smart humans have figured out they can think for themselves.

To the question...    Your only evidence for evolution: the idea that a baby has a tail at one point has been discredited: you're a hundred years behind (see the evolutionary article I've linked).    Yes, like animals we're created beings whose bodies will decompose and who feel pain. Unlike animals, we have a sense of transcendent reality, which is why we're having this discussion. We're created in God's image, which is why like him we're full of creative ability- like the computers we're using right now.    Unlike him however we're sinful and evil beings, who have rejected the knowledge of him for stuff like the idea we're nothing more than glorified monkeys with no meaning, with a chaotic and very unlikely chance origin, and a destiny of annihilation. Not only has our rebellion against God wreaked our own lives, but it's had implications for the whole of creation: hence parasitic worms and disease.    We deserve God's righteous condemnation, and yet in his mercy he has provided a way of salvation, and liberation from this dying world, in the person of Jesus Christ.

That's just a part of the life you have to lead when you are part of the animal kingdom, ask any ape, cow, dog, cat, whale, shark, emu, human, iguana, dinosaur, whatever. you can't say you're a part of nature to try and talk up evolution and then complain that Nature includes you and your race in the death processes as a way to "disprove" God.    4) In an infinite universe, anything that can exist, has to exist and has to have somewhere to exist, ok? Therefore, by sciences own reckoning there is a God, there is a Heaven and it is possible to get there after you die. Also it means that God created everything in six days and, at the same time, the big bang is solely responsible for the existence of Earth and evolution accounts for a lot of the stuff that's on it.  This is obviously a load of crap, both cannot co-exist without there being, say 12 dimensions instead of the usual 4, therefore we must scrap the infinite universe idea and that leaves us with an finite universe, which therefore does not contain everything, so where is all the other stuff which don't fit in? this is a thought that it is not possible to answer so it can not be accepted as a theory.  so we turn to theory number three; God. And, you'll notice, just using scientific theory and a bit of common sense has led us there.    Apart from those points your question is well put, but the thing is, who are you asking?  us or yourself?    i'm guessing you used to believe in God, or you got quite close to believing and something (a bereavement; i'm guessing from your "Nature lets stuff die" bit) blocked you from His Lordship and now you question everything in the hope of "disproving" God's existence because if you can "disprove" God's existence it means you have not lost anything from being unable to reach Him.  i'm sorry for your loss, and so is God, but **** happens that is what life is, **** happening, the key is how you deal with it.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Most Christians do NOT.....

What a load of evolutionary tosh people talk.  If you really believe evolution you ought to understand what you're talking about first!    Evolution, as understood in its broadest sense, meaning goo-to-you, amoeba-to-ape, is not the same thing as Natural Selection.  Natural (and artificial) Selection can be observed. We have different breeds of dogs. Lions and tigers are descended from the same 'big cat' type - they can interbreed to give Tions and Ligers. http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...  The peppered moth example is not even natural selection - it was simply changes in population. And the evidence you see in most textbooks was fabricated anyway - the moths do not lie on tree bark during the day - the famous picture is a result of glued on dead moths.  http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...    Evolution is the hypothesis that animals can change into different kinds of animals by means of natural selection working on genetic mutations.  These alleged mutations need to add genetic information. However no such genetic mutation has ever been observed. Mutations are information neutral or lossy.  'But evolution is too slow to see' protest the evolutionists. Well then it's not observable and not worthy of being even called a theory. In any case, time is the enemy - mutations are resulting in the degradation of the gene pool - that is observable.    So evolution is best described as the religion of secular humanists.    I can't believe that people are still quoting the canard that we have a 'tail' indicating our evolutionary past. This has been well known to be nonsense for many years, and is a throwback to Haeckels fraudulent work on capitulation.  http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	When I was religious, I essentially understood that it was ridiculous to argue with the evidence for evolution, and in fact accepted the verse in Genesis: "And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life" to be a simplistic description of evolution.    However, I always reserved a special place for man.  I accepted that all the other ape species were similar to us, and that there was an almost complete chain linking us to a common ancestor, but I went with Adam and Eve being special beings, placed on earth and gifted with sapience.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	What a pessimistic view you have. You sit here, typing on a laptop, probably in an amazing city, or some rural house with an amazing landscape, and tell us there is no love in the world.     According to you, it's okay to pick on little guys, weaklings, or people somehow inferior to you, because that was how you came into existence.    All of your theories mentioned above, have been disproven. you just ignore us. So fine, ignore us. But if you do, at least do us the pleasure of disappearing as well.    There is plenty of love in nature. The bear that kills the deer killed it to bring it back to its little family of cubs, who she nuzzles as they play around her.    The dolphin that lead countless people along a safe passage in that dangerous canal did it because of an instinct deep down of kindness.    If animals can love, humans can too. And so does God.    I can't follow evolution for many reasons. Not only do I KNOW it's not true, but even if I didn't, evolution is racist, and implies "might is right". It's a powerhungry greedy machine, and I will not sink to that level.    I amn't an animal. I know (for a FACT, yes, FACT) that God created me. It just makes no sense otherwise. Look at the human eye. It is amazingly complicated. There are tiny nerves all connected up. It is physically impossible for that to have evolved, and let us still see. Because just because you have 1% of an eye, does not make it 1% of sight. It's 0%.    But I amn't going to argue with you. You aren't going to listen to a word I say. But at least stop insulting us with your arguments that "evolution IS fact" when evenevolutionist scientists hae to admit that it's a theory.|`|AA12187979	Well, you are fairly selective on what Christen beliefs you analize, I believe there are a lot of Christine scientist and doctors and teachers that support the teaching of evolution in the schools.

I can't remember all the other reasons we are different but they're there.

These rights are not respected outside of the state they were issued.  If you were given a Civil Union in one state, you're still unmarried in most of the others, because your Union is not legal there.<br>  <br>  For example: A gay couple was married in Massachusetts. They moved to Texas.  They are now filing for a divorce.  Texas, who does not recognize their "marriage", since it is against Texas law, will not give them their divorce.

This doesn't eliminate the contradictions except in their own minds, or in the minds of like-minded individuals.  If the Bible was a "God-breathed" document he would have been able to construct it in such a way that nothing resembling a contradiction would be found.  The language would leave no room for misinterpretation.    Anyone who is honest will admit it's a purely human document.

Karma and reincarnation teaches that upon his death, the bad karma he accumulated goes on into another life but the recipient has no idea of the weight they are carrying. Hitler's soul could be reincarnated into another person, animal or insect. There are some people that wear mouth and nose coverings to avoid breathing someone in. (I'm not joking.)<br>  In countries where karma rules the day and homeless children roam the street, other citizens do nothing to help them. Not because they are cruel but because the child has accumulated bad karma and they believe the sooner the child dies he can begin again. I saw a news article a few years back about a heartbroken mother that had lost her 13 year son to an early death. Just after the funeral, an iguana walked into her home. The photo showed her with tears rolling down her face as she held it - because she was convinced it was her son reincarnated. <br>  I strongly suggest the book by Ravi Zacharais called "Jesus Among Other Gods".

From your question I see you have a very limited knowledge of what Reincarnationists are really about. If you're interested in the subject there are tons of books available, including serious and quite scientific case studies of the ordinary past lives of thousands of people. Look up the well-respected work of Dr. Ian Stevenson, for example. However, if you prefer to read about the lunatic fringe of Reincarnationism, as you apparently have been doing, there's lots of that too.<br>  <br>  As for the "famous" reincarnates claims, it's human nature to identify with celebrities, always has been and always will be. Most people who are unaware of reincarnation have a vague sense of self. History gives you glimpses of famous people you might have heard about a lot in past lives - Cleopatra, for example, or Napoleon. <br>  <br>  Celebrities of the past can seem hauntingly familiar... why do you think Christianity has such a death grip on society in the 21st century? By this time in history we should be moving away from ancient superstitions, but our connection with the past keeps us subconsciously mesmerized. In about 30 years or so you'll find dozens and dozens of teenagers and 20-somethings claiming to be Princess Diana reincarnated. One of them just might be a new edition of Diana Spencer, but the majority of them will be people who identified with her and loved her in their past life. <br>  <br>  Most Reincarnationists (and I know many) who have more than a superficial interest in the subject have memories of lifetimes lived by ordinary people.<br>  <br>  If you know anything about Carl Sagan, you know he was a brilliant scientist, a realist, and a dedicated debunker of all things paranormal, including especially religion. Here's what he wrote in his book "Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark" (page 300): "At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study: ...(3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any way other than reincarnation. I pick these claims ... as examples of contentions that might be true."|`|b46d397e033a3773de725a30dee4ee6faa	There are many different views on reincarnation. To dismiss it as a whole would be rushing to conclusions. There are some people who may believe in reincarnation just because the idea of being somebody else fascinates them. The feeling of significance, or entitlement that accompanies such claims is what draws them to reincarnation.<br>  <br>  The Buddhist view on reincarnation would stop these people in their tracks. The idea of being reincarnated as a human from one life to another is laughable in most Buddhist texts. The rarity of a human life, for example, is as if there was, in the whole of the ocean, a small ring. Now, there is a turtle in the water that comes up for air only once every hundred years. Now, human life is as rare as the occurrence of that turtle coming up and putting his head through that ring, in the whole of the ocean. You are much more likely to be reincarnated as a blade of grass.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i think a lot of it is wishful thinking. i meet a lot of people who claim to have died on the titanic. my dad did a past life regression course and he remembered living in bristol in the 12th century and owning a boat with a hole in it. he was a nobody. i'm not claiming this is actually true, but people tend to "remember" what they would have wanted to be, notso much what they actually were. <br>  <br>  but hey, somebody had to have been cleopatra...|`|fM7yNf8oaa	People like that are either delusional or want to sell their story.

JqHkgWROaa	Born again meaning baptised.     Bible talks about being born of spirit and water.    John 3:5  Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.|`|AA12059478	No he's referring to baptism, a ritual form of rebirth.  It doesnt get you out of samsara tho.|`|AA11008046	No - Most definitely not!  Being born again is totally different.  Born Again is part of the present life.  You die out to sin (death) and be Baptised in Water by immersion (burial) and when you come up out of the water you have risen to newness of life.  Symbolic of Jesus death burial and ressurection.  That is Biblical explanation of Born Again.  Absolutely nothing to do with reincarnation.|`|UjlKVKRhaa	No Jesus wasn't talking about reincarnation.He was talking about getting saved & sanctified.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Not reincarnation....  You must be born again of the Spirit.... A change of heart and change of desires.    You will hate sin as much as God does.    Born again does NOT mean baptized.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	aka going to hell not come back as an animal|`|mSFjbetxaa	Jesus, as an Essene, believed in reincarnation.  Paul, corrupted and altered the story of Jesus to invent a "Christ".      Jesus introduced John the Baptist saying, 'You knew him as Elijah'.    It says that God knew you before you were born.  That refers to our souls being on the otherside before we came back here again.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Reincarnation and being born again are two absolutely different things. Read the bible and try to understand before you ask this type of question, please!|`|QL0FOQMmaa	No.    Jesus is referring to the fact that unbelievers are dead to the things of God, they have no consciousness of holiness or righteousness and have no relationship with God. It is written that the things of God are foolishness to the spiritually dead. The natural mind of man, cannot comprehend the supernatural things of God.    Being born again, is having your spirit quickened by the Holy Spirit. You are made alive to the things of God. Things you didn't have a clue about, suddenly become clear and illuminated because your spirit man is made alive and you are reconciled to the Father and begin to have a relationship with Him.    It has absolutely NOTHING to do with reincarnation of any sort.|`|rWP4suXuaa	NO! a man is appointed to die only once.      God loves you....God bless|`|t6XI6W09aa	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.    Jesus is NOT talking about reincarnation, (it is not the teaching of the bible) but born again in the life here after (life after death) On the "day of judgement,"  when you are born again (resurrected) only if you keep the commandments, shall you see the kingdom of heaven, otherwise NO chance.  What are the Ten commandments?  The Ten Commandments  1.You shall have no other Gods but me.  2.You shall not make for yourself any idol, nor bow down to it or worship it.  3.You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.  4.You shall remember and keep the Sabbath day holy.  5.Respect your father and mother.  6.You must not kill.  7.You must not commit adultery.  8.You must not steal.  9.You must not give false evidence against your neighbour.  10.You must not be envious of your neighbour's goods. You shall not be envious of his house nor his wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbour.    Are you obeying specially First two commandments?  You have to remember that bible is not 100% word of god.  The teachings of Jesus is in RED ink which is 10% of the bible. Bible contains contradictions, interpolations, errors, letters of paul, pornography material, half finished stories etc etc.|`|sGojEWOxaa	This is speaking of being born again of the water (baptism) and the spirit (the Holy Ghost).  That is to happen to us during this life so that we may have eternal life.  No where in the bible does it teach in reincarnation.  3Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.      4Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?      5Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  John 3:6-8 (King James Version)     6That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.      7Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.      8The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.    1 Peter 1:22-24 (King James Version)     22Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:      23Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.      24For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:|`|V45LQYtXaa	No, that verse refers to conversion, but Matthew 17:10-13 and John 9:1-3 do imply reincarnation.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	It is not referring to reincarnation|`|Xfhfz7wsaa	Many devout Christians will tell u absolutely no, but there are many sects who believe so! There are many other verses that suggest so, just google reincarnation and bible. The bible is now left to personal interpretation, its best to do ur own research and make up ur own mind about it...|`|c7pbvYmpaa	What did I do?|`|HBp5r76haa	"Born again" means "born from above" i.e. by the power of the Spirit of God.    Jesus spells it out in the same chapter:  ""I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. " -     Here, the birth of water refers the birth from flesh (the water is the liquid in the womb that gets broken at birth), whereas the birth of the Spirit happens the moment we accept and believe in Jesus Christ as our LORD and Savior
6Zi7cA5Paa	The meaning of Al-Qadaa and Al-Qadar:<br>  When used together Al-Qadar refers to the pre-decree of an action or event before it occurs and Al-Qadaa refers to the act or event after it took place. <br>  <br>  four principals pertaining to Al Qadaa and Al-Qadar:<br>  <br>  1. Allah’s absolute knowledge of all affairs – what has happened, what is happening and what will happen till the Final Hour.<br>  <br>  2. Allah has written all that will occur in a persevered tablet – Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz before He created the heavens and the earth. <br>  <br>  3. Nothing occurs except by the Will of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, making no difference whether to refers to His Actions or to that of the created being. <br>  <br>  4. Allah is the Creator of all things – from the minute atom to our own actions.<br>  <br>  Now comes the tricky part. If our actions are already pre-decreed, where is the free will? Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala sent Messengers to guide mankind to the truth, and we are given the choice of believing and obeying the command or rejecting the truth. Allah already knows which path we will take, as it is recorded in the Lawh Al-Mahfuz. <br>  <br>  If Al-Qadar is already written for us, what is the benefit of making Dua or be punished for wrong doing? The answer to this question by the scholars is that, since we know that Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala is in charge of all affairs and is able to do all things, we ask Him and Him Alone when we are in need. He already knows who will ask Him and who will not and how He is going to answer our Dua. On the other hand we do not know if our Dua will be accepted, will it be answered immediately or a trial removed or differed to the Hereafter. The scholars have further explained events will take place if the appropriate steps are taken to make them happen.<br>  <br>  Ibn Al-Qayyim (Rahimahullah) said: “The logical consequence of such reasoning leads to rejection of all efforts. It can therefore be said to such a person who denies pre-creed – ‘If the satisfaction of your hunger and thirst has already been destined for you, then there is no need for you to eat or drink.”<br>  <br>  Another example the Shaikh used as an explanation is  “if a son has been destined for you, then you will be granted one, whether you have intercourse or not, if a son has not been destined for you, you will never be granted one, so there is no point in getting married.” This two examples show that this way of thinking is futile and incorrect.<br>  <br>  "Qada is a special section of qadar. Qadar is like the wheat stocked in a granary. And qada is like giving it in measured amounts. Hadrat 'Umar 'radiAllahu anh' came to Damascus. But when he heard that there was plague in the city, he did not enter the city. When he was asked, 'Are you running away from Allah's qada?' he said, 'I am running from Allah's qada to His qadar. For qadar may change unless it turns into qada." Qadar is like a salary list (payroll). And qada is like the distribution of the salary. Ibni Asir said, "Qada and qadar do not part from each other; for qadar is like the foundation of a building and qada is like the building itself." It is written in the entry 'qadar': "Qadar is Allah's knowing in the eternal past all that will happen. Qada is His creating the things in qadar when the time comes.<br>  <br>  May Allah bless all of us. Amin<br>  <br>  In Quran : Allah will not change the destiny of a people unless if they try to change it themselves.....13:11<br>  <br>  <br>  so, There is no such thing as why i should be punished if its all faithed, because Allah does give us options to change our  ( destiny) .|`|XPgvi9KRaa	All are created for purpose. Humans were created simply to worship God, praise Him and glorify Him. They are given the will to choose whether to fulfill their purpose of existance or not. God, as Almighty and All-Knowing, knows where every one will end up - but He does not lead one to evil or for that matter to doing good deeds for that is totally left to the indivitual. Your logic would have hold only if God was the decider of whether someone does good deeds or bad deeds. But that is not the case and people are rewarded according to what they do in this life.|`|ColDKgGuaa	Isn't that the same for CHRISTIANS?

6beL9zycaa	Yes, he is a bully, just not an "intellectual" bully.  But more importantly, you never got your answers regarding your neanderthal dinner party, & I for one am outraged!  So, depending on the ages of your dinner guests (the babies & elderly~ elderly being 18 yrs of age & over~ will require less mammoth meat, & it will need to be pureed for them since they will be sans teeth.) If the average age of your guests is say... 12 to 13 (middle aged) you will need approximately one lb. of mammoth meat per neanderthal.  Don't forget to put a plastic drop cloth down, it WILL get messy, I can assure you.  And DO NOT serve any kind of flaming dishes or desserts, ie: Baked Alaska, etc. or you will have one hellofa food fight~ fire tends to make them extremely nervous & anxious.<br>  After your guests have gone, you can just take the tarp out, roll it up, & discard in the garbage.  Just make sure they really have gone, or you may find them eating the garbage in the morning.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, & best wishes for a successful & deLICious dinner!|`|FRNDkLNqaa	Yes he does,lets get together and kick his ***|`|F32uPjAraa	No he is not.

I don't believe there's a word for it...|`|ul1P1qAQaa	It depends on what you want from it. We normally communicate things for a purpose, if you would like to somehow identify with this sentiment and make it an important facet of your person, then you could say you were bi, gay, "open to suggestion" or just open.    I find it hard not to look at womens curves, and I stare at them more often then I look at guys. I can also recognize how sexually attractive they are in that sense. It doesn't serve my purpose to identify with this aesthetic attraction though because I have a boyfriend that I am equally attracted to, and I neither need to justify my actions to society nor is it useful for anyone to have that knowledge. I've openly admitted it in the course of conversations when it added to them, so I don't feel I'm hiding any larger part of who I am, it just isn't relevant to think to long and hard about the significance of this attraction.    If my current relationship ended or some situation arose where I would have to question if that's something I want or not, I would probably leave it at that and not try and derive some greater significance or reformulate my entire identity around that. What reason does there have to be other than that as sexually mature adults we all think about sex from time to time, and it would be fair to say that sometimes people mix that with the feelings we get from other people as well; curiosity, respect, hatred, disgust, intrigue, joy, sadness, fear, comfort... wouldn't you say?|`|VDTTzwlUaa	I don't know, I guess it could be classified as a fetish of some kind.

In the end we are all responsible for our own values and beliefs, no matter what we were forced fed. Sadly most people don't see this.

You should not pray to the golden calf if you are a Christian. However, there are many wonderful beautiful prayer books available to help those who have trouble starting their conversations with God. Stop obsessing in something so superficial like having to have the perfect prayer. Conversations requesting help from Jesus come from the heart. <br>  I pray the rosary and I pray Litanies. They are beautiful prayers. They are reflective and meditation prayers. There are many forms of prayer and Jesus rejects none of them as long as you are sincere in your prayers.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	I'd recommend praying the rosary.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

To us, it seems cruel that God would allow a baby to be created, and then have its life suddenly taken away. However, I believe that there is a reason behind why God did that. We all have a spirit inside us. It governs our personality, etc. Satan is out to ruin us - to convince our spirits to join him. God may have done this to the baby to protect it from Satan. It may have had a weak spirit that needed proection. Also, I believe that babies that die before they have the chance to live automatically go to heaven. So those babies that are aborted, miscarried or stillborn go straight back to God - can you think of anything more wonderful?<br>  <br>  It is hard for us to comprehend, but we must trust that God knows best, and will direct our lives in the right way.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped!|`|qNWqdAclaa	Because He loves that child. All of us are created as unique and special to Him. None of our lives are going to go the way that He originally planned for us...but He still created us because He loves us so much.

That's not God's perfect plan, but the best place for that child is in God's arms.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	So you are suggesting in a perfect world all women who want to abort their babies would be infertile and never be allowed to get pregnant to begin with?

A hundred years ago, we would have also been giving up our seat to women as a generality, but now it's just typically the pregnant women, the elderly or the physically impaired (crutches).     Just last week I offered to give my seat up to an elderly gentleman. He thanked me and declined. I noticed that others started to offer their seats to other elderly people they noticed were standing. It's just common courtesy and whether or not we were raised with that courtesy, most people will offer their seats to an elderly person without one.|`|i48kxrbaaa	I do it, and I guess it depends on city because where I am, people often give up their seats.

I work in a high school, and I can't tell you how many times I've watched male students open the doors for themselves and then let it slam in some girl's face, rather than hold it open. Even worse.... I've watched a visually impaired student get knocked over in the hallways because people get annoyed by her as she navigates (with a cane) through the hallways.    I think it is the deterioration of the family structure, and the absence of positive male role modes in so many young mens' lives. And it's scary to think that if this is the way the current generation is being raised.... what's in store for the next?!!    The guys I know that have more chivalrous manners have them because their fathers (and mothers) have instilled this behavior in them.

They are grumpy and can be demanding, which is why a lot of people don't kowtow to them.    I think you should offer your seat to an elderly person, a pregnant woman, and a person with disabilities (with PWD being first, pregnant 2nd, and elderly last). However, it's not a requirement.

In truth , the Disciple John , in the New Testament, was in a deep sleep . In that deep sleep, the Lord came to him because John had been at odds over dietary requirements of  Christians. In that meeting , the Lord showed John , something like a sheet, with all the creatures of the earth, sea and sky, gathered upon it. The Lord told John that all these creatures were fit to eat, and we should not be concerned over what is fit and not fit to eat. As long as it is wholesome, ( not rotten or poisoned) we should be O.K. ( I paraphrase here) Also mentioned in the New Testament,( I don't remember where) we are not to argue of get difficult with others and their eating habits as a guest at someone's house, or the other way around,( a guest at your house). If you were a guest at someone's house, they served tomatoes, and you couldn't stand them, eat the other things served, don't whine. The inverse would be true as a host, if you KNOW your guest can't stand tomatoes, don't be a jerk and serve them anyway, cut each other a little slack. What has the Pope got to do with me eating what I want? Nothing , I bet. Homosexuality is not mentioned often , but when it is brought to light, it is in a very serious context. "ABOMINATION IN THE EYES OF THE LORD". Very plain, very simple,  I mean , what don't you get about "ABOMINATION"? I didn't see much in the line of what or what not to eat.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Because if the Pope tried to demonize "Red Lobster," he would lose members in droves and he could no longer live in his opulent surroundings.

So the law against homosexuality is still in effect.<br>  <br>  FYI - the Pope never overturned Purgatory. Purgatory is a dogma of the Catholic faith and must be believed by faithful Catholics.

We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<br>  21<br>      13 For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2corinthians/2corinthians5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2corinthi...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Colossians<br>  Chapter 3<br>  <br>  1<br>      1 If then you were raised with Christ, seek what is above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.<br>  2<br>      Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.<br>  3<br>      For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br>  4<br>      When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with him in glory.<br>  5<br>      2 Put to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly: immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and the greed that is idolatry. 3 <br>  6<br>      Because of these the wrath of God 4 is coming (upon the disobedient).<br>  7<br>      By these you too once conducted yourselves, when you lived in that way.<br>  8<br>      But now you must put them all away: 5 anger, fury, malice, slander, and obscene language out of your mouths.<br>  9<br>      Stop lying to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices<br>  10<br>      6 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed, for knowledge, in the image of its creator.<br>  11<br>      Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, 7 slave, free; but Christ is all and in all.<br>  12<br>      Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,<br>  13<br>      bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.<br>  14<br>      And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection.<br>  15<br>      And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body.

Look at the large, pro-homophobia advocacy groups and churches which daily try to redefine morality.  They want to convince everyone that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."  That way, people can treat gay taxpayers unfairly, take away our civl rights and still feel all comfy and cozy while labeling it "hating the sin and loving the sinner."|`|0hdo4WORaa	Everyone needs a hobby|`|NWnOTkwCaa	False premise city!!!<br>  Homosexuality has never "proved" to be biological...that's pure myth. Even if it were, we can answer that. <br>  Christians (real Christians) do not "hate" gays or anyone else. That is a lie and a slander.<br>  If I saw you about to put your hand on a hot stove and yelled "stop," would that be "hate?"<br>  If I saw you on the ledge of a tall building and yelled "don't jump," would that be "hate?"<br>  There simply is not and never has been any evidence that homosexuality is biological, inherited, or genetic. Not one bit. But if it were....<br>  Cancer, sickle cell anemia, and many other disorders are genetic. When we ask God to heal people from these disorders -- when we provide treatment for some that is "natural," that people are "born with," does that mean we "hate" those people? No one would say so, of course. That's absurd.<br>  You see, there are some basic principles to existence, to the very fabric of the universe. There's day/night. light/dark, positive/negative. The eastern religions understand this and embody it it their "yin/yang" concept. Another basic universal principle is male/female.<br>  Now when someone violates one of the basic principles of the universe, of existence itself -- as recognized by both eastern and western cultures, all over the world since the start of time -- when someone rebels against existence itself in so radical a way, it's not hate to point out that they are calling down doom and destruction on themselves -- and collateral damage on anyone nearby.<br>  As evidence, look at the fate of every culture and civilization that has rebelled in this way against these basic principles of existence itself:<br>  Sodom - Gone with the wind<br>  Gomorrah - Turned to dust<br>  Canaan - Disappeared from the face of the earth<br>  The Greek Empire - a few ruins, otherwise, turned back to sand<br>  The Roman Empire - rose, fell, gone baby gone<br>  So we don't "hate" gays, there's no evidence they're "born that way," even if they are it's still a disorder, and suggesting that people repent is not hate, it's love. Any questions?|`|msNXomjTaa	Christians are not supposed to hate gays.<br>  <br>  However, they are also not supposed to be gay.  There is an expression: "Hate the sin, not the sinner."<br>  <br>  This is a complex issue.  Many feel that Scripture condemns homosexuality fairly clearly.  Others think differently, and look to the messages of love, tolerance, and forgiveness.  These are two interpretations, both using Scripture, but both heading in different directions.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality has not been proved to be solely biological.  This seems to be the case, but it has yet to be definitively proved.  The "gay gene" has not been found.  (My guess is that it will be, some day.)  <br>  <br>  My own denomination (Anglican) is wrestling with this very matter, and my priest even left the Anglican Church of Canada over the issue.  Western, liberal Anglicans (and others) tend to accept homosexuality, while the rest of the world (90% of Anglicans) are against it.  Perhaps God's voice is to be heard in the multitudes.|`|Io9288c7aa	Christians don't hate homosexuals, only Homosexuality.<br>   As another poster said, "hate the sin but love the sinner."<br>   And the reason Christians  hate Homosexuality is Because God also hates and condemns it, although loving all sinners enough to die for our sins, if we but repent and turn from then and turn to Him.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	It's because they like to pick and choose what parts of the Bible they live their lives by. They pick up on the part that condemns homosexuality, but ignore things like judge not, let he without sin cast the first stone. They like to talk about Jesus being their savior and what not, but they don't follow his example of tolerance and acceptance. <br>  <br>  But when it's convenient for them they will quote all those things back to you.|`|05JDm7K3aa	We dont hate the actual human beings as we as christians are taught to love each other. We hate the HOMOSEXUALITY which is a SIN to GOD! That's why he destroyed an two cities (Sodom and Gomorrah). It perverses God's command, to remain STRAIGHT. We love what God loves and Hate what God hates. Everyone is loved of God, it is the homosexuality that is the big difference. It's a grave sin! Noone is born GAY. God does not create anyone to be GAY else then he would be hypocritical in destroying two cities wouldn't HE? God hates SIN. HOmOSex is sin and so God hates that not the persons themselves! Is dat better?|`|cdFqekzZaa	People don't choose to be serial killers either.Is it ok? Many groups hate gays.Don't be so prejudiced .I'm not a christian and I think homosexuality is a serious illness.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Is there some sort of concerted effort on the part of homosexuals to ask this question repeatedly every day?  Is it a campaign to claim that all Christians hate all homosexuals?  What's the deal?|`|jwKOANhpaa	Because that's what they do.  They pick anything and everything they can to hate.  They love to hate.  I grew up in this environment all my life.  Makes me sick.|`|2tf60aRSaa	They don't.

HE says that homosexuality along with adultery and fornication (having sex without being married to the person) is immorality and will keep a person out of heaven unless it is repented of and turned away from.  For Him to forbid something means it is not a biological disorder but a choice on the person's part.  It is true that some people are driven by unconscious forces they may not completely understand... but it is also true that when a person looks to God for help and healing, it is completely possible to walk away from every kind of sin if a person wants freedom.  <br>  <br>  Sin of any kind holds a person in deeper and deeper bondage and pain.  <br>  <br>  People do choose to be gay to try to fill empty spaces left by parents they could not bond with in a healthy way.  <br>  <br>  Telling people that their sin is okay is not being loving with them.  <br>  <br>  That's not politically correct, but it is true.  <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6 says about homosexuality and other sins in the list, "and such WERE some of you.   But you were sanctified, you were justified (cleansed and made righteous)....."  when they turned from their sin and trusted in Messiah Yeshua (Jesus).  <br>  <br>  Nothing is impossible for G-d.  <br>  <br>  And real Christians love every person G-d created.  He does not want any of us to perish.  That is why He sent Messiah so that every human's sin could be atoned for and every human could be given the strength and power to turn from sin and walk in emotional wholeness within and with others. <br>  <br>  There is much deception in the world today because people would rather hear what is pleasant to them than what is true.  The Bible warns that a time will come when people will call good "evil" and evil "good"-- a time when they won't put up with sound doctrine and when they will say, "Stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel."  It says that even when God punishes (sends judgment), people will curse Him instead of taking the "spanking" to heart.  <br>  <br>  Your (and my) arms are too short to box with God.    It's like we are calling dirtier and dirtier water "clean,"  but He knows what the human body requires... and there is no substitute for clean.
8rbQBaIeaa	This is one of those things that you would have had to be there to laugh. I was taking my dobermans to the vet on a country road. As I was driving, I saw a six foot tall ghost. The ghost was turning to face my direction with arms spreading open and I did the fastest U-turn you have ever seen. I went home, called the police and told them which small park the ghost was at...They even had the audacity to want my name and phone number for calling in the report instead of getting the ghost. I met the police out there, and come to find out, my ghost was a naked woman who was turning to show her naked body to me. I thought she was a ghost because she had on a white sheet. Apparently she escaped from one of the nearby institutions and was selling her body at the park for cokes and cigarettes....oh yeah...she wasn't six foot tall either...|`|AA11466759	well, there was this one time I was sure there were alligators under my bed...I was so convinced that there was something there that instead of getting up normally, I would go to the corner of my bed, then jump across the bedroom to the door, and on my way back, I would jump from my door to the bed  (I often failed at this).<br>  <br>  I became a very good long jumper in those days...I always came in first.|`|AA10246871	About a month ago, I went outside at about 1:15 a.m. to have a cigarette. It had snowed earlier in the week, and there was about 5" of snow on all the lawns on our side of the street. <br>  <br>  I went back out again around 2:30 a.m., and there were footprints in the snow coming from the street in front of our next door neighbor's house and ending between out trucks (both my husband and I drive trucks). I went out and looked, and there was snow between the trucks. Whoever had been out there had stood in the middle between the two, but not near enough to either of them to touch them or mess with them. I could clearly see the footprints in the snow because we had shoveled there, and there was less, like maybe only 1 1/2". Whoever it was was either a largish boy or a very small man. The shoe prints were from sneakers, and they were a tiny bit bigger than mine, but not big enough for a really normal sized man (I wear a size 8 1/2 women's shoe, so that's a size 7 in men's). Whoever it was just stood there, and turned this way and that for a while, then walked away.<br>  <br>  I am not sure who it was (though there is a kind of creepy kid in our neighborhood--it was a school night, though, so he should have been home in bed), or what they were doing standing there in our driveway, but it was pretty creepy.|`|czf6uhIraa	The very first time I joined the R&S community.

It was after midnight, pitch black, raining and hailing on us and I escaped the burning plane through a split in the cabin wall, jumped 12 feet onto the marshy river bank and took cover behind a hay bale, with other burned and wounded passengers while we waited nearly an hour for rescue crews to find us.|`|pVrNJmgpaa	hmmm, i get sleep paralysis, which can get a little funky.

4DEVVRlIaa	I think it is. Those people shouldn't be allowed to have kids if they can't have the basic emotion of caring for a child. I think a lot of them don't give their kids a second thought.    The ones that really piss me off are the ones that smoke around their kids, whether it be in a car or a restuarant. You want to kill yourself with cancer...go right ahead but don't take your child with you. No child should start out life with all these kinds of problems because adults only care about their needs.    There are some circumstances where the law should step in. Smoking, drugs and alchol is one.    All I can say to those people. THINK OF YOUR CHILD YOU SELFISH SOB!    I bet you they would be at their kids funeral crying and asking why. Well stupid, your nasty habit and the fact that you were selfish killed your child.    Bringing a child into this world is a major responsiblity. And you should put the childs needs above yours. But all too often I see people cranking out kids like a pez despenser.    It makes me sad. I never ever want to see a child harmed. I consider the things I stated as child abuse and they should be punished.|`|bCp9wZgSaa	I don't think it is I know it is. Drug and/or alcohol use does life long damage on a child.

However, I do think they should cut back as much as possible.    Drugs: Completely irresponsible no excuses.    Drinking: They say red wine in moderation is good for a healthy pregnancy, other drinks such as Guiness are very high in iron. No problem with drinking when pregnant, big problem with binge drinking while pregnant.    You are also supposed to avoid anything with caffeine (that's most of your fizzy drinks out the window) and anything spicy.    If a woman stuck to all of it then it would drive them insane. Give up the cigarettes but if it's stressing you out too much then you are probably better just cutting back as much as possible. Drugs are a big no no. Just be careful what you drink and keep it in moderation.    Either way it is not child abuse because it is not a 'child' until it is born. However those who smoke like a chimney and drink like a fish while pregnant do disgust me.|`|AA12071655	My mother smoked while she was carrying me and I'm fine as are all three of my sisters. Of course this was back in the bad ol' ignorant '50s when no one knew any better. Since no one knew any better, babies were born just fine.    Now, if a baby is born with problems and it can be shown they are due to the mother's actions while pregnant you may have a point. But since the child is not yet born, we know nothing about any problems, or lack of problems, so you're putting the cart before the horse.|`|rThIVk2maa	Well, you could consider a lot of things people do that are bad for their kids to be child abuse, such as raising them to be impolite, feeding them unhealthy food or even just having kids when you can't afford them.     But then we can't control everything people do, nor should we.|`|AA10168935	It's less harmful than smacking them all the time once they leave the womb.  That's legal.

I know many bright, honest, hardworking theists.<br>  <br>  Some have been indoctrinated at an early age, and perhaps it's not their fault.  Some just have an emotional need to believe in an invisible man that can hear their thoughts.  So, they're apparently just a bit different, not really 'inferior'.|`|ab5eb6c79489fdbbacde1ce1372f5f98aa	Theists are not naturally inferior or something like that.

pvYy6iTSaa	chasingcars -   King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table never existed in real life. They're purely figures of legend. There might have been someone called Arturus (or Riothamus) in Britain's distant past, but if there was, he was probably a Romano-British leader or military general campaigning against the marauding Saxon hordes in the 5th century AD. In that period of history, however, there was no such thing as knights-in-armour - horsemen didn't even use stirrups until much later, so they couldn't have worn and fought in armour. There are several theories about the location of the 'original' court of Camelot, and although research continues, these are irrelevances: King Arthur and his knights will always be figures of fantasy, and Arthurian legend should be appreciated for what it is: a large and unique body of wonderful early European literature.     Arthur was first identified as a fictional high king from Britain's past by a monk of Welsh origin, Geoffrey of Monmouth, who chronicled 'Historia Regum Brittaniae' - "The History of the Kings of Britain" - early in the 12th Century. In a masterpiece of medieval prose he defined - in latin - the earliest coherent version of the Arthurian legend. He provides a convincing historical context and details King Arthur's origins and the heroic deeds of his knights, but Geoffrey's ancient sources have never been found. Nonetheless, the 'Historia' was an important cultural influence on medieval society and Geoffrey of Monmouth gave the British consciousness a heroic King to rival Charlemagne, King of the Franks. He also gave the world an extraordinary and evocative tale that has caught the imagination of creative minds through the generations.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	There is a couple of good answers a couple of answers below. They have some websites to go to. But there isn't any proof that they did or didn't exist. There are some texts out there that have some proof that they did happen but not under the name of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Although there was a King Arthur, but its unknown if he had a Round Table of Knights|`|qRx3ynKdaa	The may be some reality. But probably not much.    We know very little about 5th/6th century Britain, the time and place when Arthur was supposed to flourish, but dont even know if Arthur actually did exist then.    Some scholars think so. Some think he never existed. Some think that as far as the legendary Arthur had any historical prototype, it was Lucius Artorius Castus, a second century Roman legionary in Britain. See http://www.mun.ca/mst/heroicage/issues/1... .    Others have other theories.    Most think the whole matter isnt a subject for history as one cant really write a history of a man when you can't prove he even existed.    You will find some discussion here http://www.britannia.com/history/h12.htm... . And there are lots of other sites on the web.    But be warned, the subject of Arthur is rather a nut magnet.|`|axwdwiSuaa	"Most historians of the King Arthur era agree that at one time in England there was a king known as Arthur.

[Matthew 12:40]<br>  <br>  Only by dying on Wednesday could He have fulfilled His own TIME SPECIFIC prophecy!<br>  <br>  What actually happened during those three days  Jesus was buried is explained in Hoseas 6:1-2:<br>  "Come, let us return to the LORD. <br>  ...He has torn us to pieces <br>  ...but he will heal us; <br>  ...he has injured us <br>  ...but he will bind up our wounds. <br>  After two days he will revive us; <br>  ...on the third day he will restore us, <br>  ...that we may live in his presence. "<br>   [Hosea 6:2]<br>  <br>  This is what happens ro ALL humans when we die.  Our souls are revived and restored, and we ar taken into the presence of God.<br>  <br>  On the first two days he was being healed.  On the Third day, He rested, being glorified by God, being "revived" by his rest.  He arose then after the Third day, to new life in the Presenc of God.<br>  <br>  Note that if Jesus died on Wednesday, and was "rested" on the third day --The third day Was Saturday, The Jewsih Sabbath.  This is imporant to note, because even in His death Jesus honored the Sabbath day, and did not work, made no effort, until Sunday -- the time when the Jewish Sabbath is finished.

ExCAedp4aa	Waterboarding isn't torture: according to many who have not been waterboarded. <br>  <br>  Waterboarding is torture: according to everyone who's had it done to them.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Let me tell you something, when WWI happened, we took prisoners and the enemy took prisoners. A lot of the prisoners came here in the USA and were put in camps through out the country. My grandfather was a guard at one of these facilities and on weekends they the guards would take these prisoners home for some enjoyment for them, because they were young men away from home and were very lonely for their families. Oh, I'm sure there were some very bad prisoners in some of these camps but the majority were young men like our boys in their country. Unlike their camps that put our boys in holes and covered them over with hatches and didn't let any daylight shine through, or if they got to their role call late for any reason they were beaten or whipped. Or they fed them scraps and starved our boys to death. We treated our prisoners pretty good. Even now we do. they get three square meals a day and recreation time a descent bed and bedding's and a roof over their heads. And if we torture them, like their water boarding, it doesn't kill them or really harm them, and they still get all the essentials they need to live descent lives while they are captured. So there is no comparison to the torture other countries that have our boys and they do not provide them with much of anything.<br>  Just ask any POW from our passed wars and they will tell you the torture tactics these countries used on them. McCain is a good example,  And many many of the POW's that came back from Vietnam, some of the tactic they used were terrible and these American men that experienced it are scared for life.

When I started college, I didn't know anyone and I don't "act" gay (no lisp, my room is a mess, etc) so I had to come out all over again.

I haven't been able to live as I would normally because we have ultra-religious roommates that we are the outsiders so yes I am in the closet and my SO is a M2F TS and she has had to go back to "living" undercover and that hurts because I know some of my mistakes have caused this and on top of it she has been hurt worse facing the depression and disgust on top of medical issues that are worsening by the day.    It hurts because I really feel like I let her down and because of the skeletons hanging in my closet with me, I am having to face the potential of losing her either to her health or to her wanting to leave.|`|kACHrXEyaa	uh im going to have to lie to my mom that i went back in to keep her from sending me off to become ungay. i dont think my girlfriend would like that very well =P      IHOP!!!!|`|UJHAHoqjaa	yeah all the time before but now i have learned not to be ashamed of it and if people ask i will say yeah im bi so what.if a guy asks me out i am not afraid to say oh i will be your friend but i don't do relationships with boys that are anymore then friends. so yeah i have had to go back in the closet before but i try to be honest and myself now.i think how am i ever going to get a girlfriend if i lie and say that am straight when im not straight in any way at all.i mean im more a lesbian then i am straight that's for sure.|`|9Ks4ByIAaa	When i first mentioned it to my mom, she flipped out and i had to act like it was just a phase, and occasionally date a guy, but never felt anything.

k5sZq2T4aa	When it is the right thing to do, a child should not be having sex, some might say age 16, but that's still too young for some girls, some can handle the stress of having sex at a young age, some cant, What age I would prefer to have sex, the first time for me was 2 weeks before my 17th birthday, and I wasn't ready, the best ans I can give is when the girl is ready, not when she thinks she is, but when she is truly ready and wont end up regretting the experience|`|SCVGcAyAaa	i think when you r married but i did it at 14|`|50UbJp14aa	As soon as i get a girlfriend and she agrees around 19 or something. i am 18 now|`|7q78bhAaaa	i already had sex at 16 and it sucked.|`|ydDP3VRQaa	11|`|a7IAkpJtaa	18|`|AA11589320	From the time I realised what it was for until death.

Actual sex from 14 to 16 is reasonable providing the people are of similar age.      Beyond 16 I think a person should be wises enough to be able to decide whats right for him yet there should be flexibility in this as a middle aged man driving a $100,000 car could demand a lot|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	I was 18, and could happily have waited longer...peer pressure :-(|`|NWopkX4baa	When you're in a committed relationship with someone you love?|`|b2bMy1EAaa	I was 13!

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  I hope this helps answer your general questions.<br>  <br>  01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.<br>  02. Wiccan’s are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.<br>  03. Wiccan’s are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.<br>  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.<br>  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans don’t practice magick.<br>  06. Wiccan’s show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).<br>  07. Wicca’s ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").<br>  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.<br>  09. Wiccan’s more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps out.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|yAvTxh47aa	People who ask Wiccans to make spells for them are ignorant.<br>  <br>  While some Wiccans do indulge in such practices, it's rather like saying "Hey, Jew, make a bagel for me!"|`|cECRv4NMaa	There are many paths to wicca. some say that Wicca is Neo-pagan, but I think there are paths that predate the book religions. Spells are like prayers. Wicca are very spiritual, believe in a like with their Deity (ies) and with nature. I hope this helps, It takes a long to for Wiccas to truly answer, there is so much information about us, AND there are as many beliefs in Wicca (and Paganism) as there are those who practice it. I have been Wicca 15+ years and there is still so much to learn....|`|6aIuZZi7aa	A follower of Wicca, a neo-pagan religion. Some Wiccans practice witchcraft.
VJN6Bvloaa	Because they have no other arguments. The only difference between Macro and Micro evolution is timescale.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edward: Yes, it is true that scientists used the terms Micro and Macro evolution... IN THE FIFTIES! All you've done is proven that scientifically, creationism is at least 50 years behind evolution. The terms were abandoned when scientists realized that they are the same thing.|`|AA10147323	Microevolution is fact; macroevolution is a hypothesis.  It requires more faith to accept macroevolution than to accept creation.  The literature is replete with top evolutionists admitting that scientifically and mathematically, macroevolution is impossible but they still accept it.  Now, that's what I call faith.<br>  <br>  Ever heard of "hopeful monsters"?  <br>  <br>  I really do not care where the terminology came from.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	The answers here are typical - those that reject "macro" evolution essentially reject evolution as the means of species diversification.  And they don't quote science as their counter evidence, they quote scripture.<br>  <br>  Their limited, dogmatic faith drives them to be evolution-deniers.<br>  <br>  Evolution is a solid theory, simple at the core and complex in the details.  It employs well-understood mechanisms:<br>  <br>  Replication + Variation + Selection = Evolution<br>  <br>  It has evidence to support each component, it has mountains of evidence found in the fossil record, in vestigial traits in living creatures, in morphology, in genetics and in molecular biology. The facts of evolution are supported by and mesh with other sciences like geology, paleontology, physics, other aspects of biology, cosmology, etc. And it is supported by thousands of critical scientists trying to prove each other wrong, or trying to add their own insights to the theory. For evolution to NOT be true, many other sciences must have also made major mistakes.<br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers claim Evolution is "only a theory".  But in science, any complex model in science is called a "theory".  The theory that life evolved from earlier life is as well supported as the "theories" that the continents drift, that germs cause disease and that stuff is made of atoms.  You can bet you life on all of those "theories".<br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers claim there is no evidence for Evolution.  This is a lie.  Here are a long list of strong evidence for evolution, and even a list of how you'd disprove evolution, and why the evidence supports evolution:<br>  <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/...</a><br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers claim scientists are "abandoning" evolution because some scientists signed a statement saying they are skeptical that Darwinian evolution accounts for all the variation in the species.  But (1) this doesn't mean those scientists believe it takes divine or non-natural intervention for evolution to happen, and (2) the list is a fraud:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty1Bo6GmPqM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty1Bo6GmP...</a><br>   <br>  Not only that, but there are 12,000 Christian CLERGY who've signed a statement supporting evolution and rejecting the teaching of creationism as science.  Science isn't about voting, but even if it was, evolution still wins.<br>  <a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/Christian_Clergy/ChrClergyLtr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/Chri...</a><br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers claim the fossil record does not support evolution, and that there are no intermediate species.  This is an outright lie.  <br>   <br>  Professional evolution-deniers like Kent Hovind or Harun Yahya claim that a "transitional fossil" is some unworkable mutant like half-crocodile/half-duck or half-starfish/half-flounder.  They paint these ridiculous pictures, then say "see!  none exist!".   <br>   <br>  However, evolution doesn't work that way.  Evolution works by tiny changes over a long time, so that species slowly morph into different species.  When you grow from an infant to an adult, your left leg doesn't grow to full size first, then your right arm, then your head.  Similary, evolution doesn't happen to make a whale's head on a cow's body.  <br>   <br>  Here is a devout Christian explaining about all sorts of intermediate species and how the fossil record absolutely supports evolution: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9a-lFn4hqY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9a-lFn4h...</a><br>   <br>  Here is an example of how scientists used evolutionary theory to predict a particular undiscovered species should exist, when it should have existed, and where to dig NOW to find a fossil of it.  They went to that spot, and dug up not one, but five examples.  What successful predictions has creationism ever made?  <br>  <a href="http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/searching4Tik.html" rel="nofollow">http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/searching4...</a><br>  <br>  That last example is important:  the ONLY reason for the above prediction to be true is because "macroevolution" is FACT.  <br>   <br>  Here is a fantastic video explaining many many transitional species:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfoje7jVJpU&feature=PlayList&p=258CAE2F4546AA95&index=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfoje7jVJ...</a><br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers, unable to refute the actual theory of evolution, then say "evolution doesn't explain the creation of the first life or the creation of the universe." That is also dishonest, because the theory of evolution doesn't ATTEMPT to explain those.  It has nothing to do with those.   It's like saying chemistry is all false because it doesn't explain where the elements came from.  <br>   <br>  The birth of the universe is cosmology, not evolution.  And non-life to life is abiogenesis.  The theory of evolution is about how different species formed.<br>   <br>  Evolution-deniers claim we've never SEEN evolution - that's a lie, because we have:<br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26lab.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/scienc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080417112433.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13845002/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13845002/</a><br>   <br>  This example even ADDED information (through gene duplication), something many evolution-deniers say is impossible:<br>  <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/8/931" rel="nofollow">http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprin...</a><br>   <br>  Finally, bad scientific theori|`|91XGHfSaaa	Remember that ID was never intended to be scientific, or to advance scientific knowledge - its sole purpose is to argue evolutionary theory by whatever means available.<br>  <br>  Made up terminology is the least of its problems.|`|cz4lmVBNaa	It's funny how they accept microevolution, yet reject macroevolution which is just basically microevolution over an elongated period of time. How dumb can they get?|`|c99jycZIaa	Because some people believe that it is "scientific" to conclude that all life originated in a primordial soup simply because penguins have wings but do not fly.<br>  <br>  Adaptation does not suggest abiogenesis.|`|wZpahhHzaa	Because they only skim scientific reports looking for ways to criticize the scientists.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I find it ironic many are okay with "micro," but "macro"? Oh goodness no, "heaven forbid" they ever conclude that enough micro adds up to macro over time.|`|YupMCYHlaa	There is a form of evolution that can be proven.  It can be demonstrated.  So creationists can't deny it.  So rather than try to deny it, they pretend that this is a different category of evolution, that this is possible but the other isn't. It's possible, they say, to make changes to a species, but not to create a new species.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Actually no, micro is the examination of evolutionary principles on and within the species level such as in relevance to genetic mutations and adaptations to environment within the species from one generation to the next.<br>  <br>  Macro is the examination of evolutionary principles above the species level, from a grander scale and seeks to explore the Origin of Life in all it's Diversity.<br>  <br>  Though the two are very much interconnected and are usually only separated theoretically when focusing on either/or specifically ... the reason most creationists (the ones that actually are somewhat intelligent) make such a distinction is because the Bible supports micro not macro. Mirco simply expresses how we change over time, within the species, Macro seeks to explain how life got here individually (which Creationists attribute to God) hence the conflict. Understand?<br>  <br>  One is "small scale" and one is "grand scale" but Evolution in terms of "grand scale" is still just a theory. No transitional forms between the species has ever been found to sustantiate it. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  xoxo ?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	they are legitimate scientific terms actually. they don't mean what creationists think they mean, though. micro is concerned with mechanism (mutation, selection, and fiddly biochemical stuff), while macro is concerned with pattern - common descent, the fossil record, evolution of novel structures, and so on. there is nothing going on in macroevolution that's not explainable in terms of microevolution, but it's often inconvenient to deal with that level of detail. to creationists, macroevolution seems to mean 'that degree of change which can't be observed in experiments'. as such, it's a moving target. perhaps they want a movie showing all atomic motions for the last 4 billion years. I wonder if even that would be enough. saying you believe in 'microevolution but not macroevolution' is a little like saying you believe in gravity, but not planetary orbits. fracking stupid, in other words.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	First, define the word evolution -<br>  <br>  I believe it means that one species becomes (evolves) into a completely NEW species. <br>  (This is MACRO-evolution)<br>  <br>  To selectively breed a Chihuahua, or a Irish Wolf Hound from a wild wolf is NOT evolution it is a variation within a species, that some call MICRO-evolution.<br>  <br>  MICRO-evolution or variation has been observed many times, but<br>  <br>  MACRO-evolution has NEVER been observed, No transitional fossils have ever been found, and properly identified as such.<br>  <br>  It is NOT a matter of time either, As what is a rat going to "evolve" into?<br>  A duck-billed plattypus? It ain't ever gunna happen kiddo!<br>  <br>  No, evolution is an unproven belief.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|rGEZup0Zaa	They believe in "adaption, but not evolution".<br>  <br>  If you can walk ten feet, you can walk ten miles.<br>  <br>  Utter fail, even as an apologetic.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Not true if you were of the history of science you would see that the terms were used by evolutionists first. Give me a few moments and I will try to find reference for you. The distinction between micro evolution and macro evolution was made by evolutionary biologists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1937 genetics and the origin of the species Reprinted 1982 New York Columbia University Press, 1937 12 This accusation against creationists was leveled by Darwinist Gary Hurd in 2005 who represented himself as an expert on evolutionary biology.

To find a little bit about Atlantis do a search on "Edgar Cayce, Atlantis". For the Wonders of the world, I guess you could just do a search on that. But the only actual mystery about those would be Pyramids of Giza. If you're interested in that you might want to look up the Pyramids of Xian.<br>  <br>  That's the best I can offer you.

VjmTK6uZaa	It is probably a demon in you.  Don't be scared though.  Many people have them to.  It is just something you need to pray out.  The next time you feel these come on.  Don't just give a couple minute prayer and think its all okay now.  NO, get on your knees and pray to God.  Speak to him and give all your problems to God.  Completely surrender yourself to him.  Don't just pray for a few mins and get up and go on with your day.  Even when you don't feel the evil presence, still pray and thank God for taking the demon out of you.  I honestly felt this way to.  I prayed and repented for all I did wrong.  When I was almost done prayer, I felt a release.  I felt as if something had fleed my body and I had to take a big breath because it took the breath outta me.  Then I felt happy.  I knew it was a demon being taken out of me.  I just recommend to pray longer then you have been.  God Bless.|`|LUGWyWrLaa	Remember that you are in control of you mind.  Satan is trying to ruin you.  Don't let him in.

7VJcd5YLaa	Immersion in the language is key.  All lessons are taught in the language in the MTC.  Most leave with the ability to have a bsic conversation about the teachings of the Gospel in the new language.  The day to day living comes with time in the country.<br>  <br>  Some missionaries are more successful than others at learning a new language.  I was very blessed in that once I landed in France, I was paired with missionaries that did not speak English for at least 9 months of my 16 month mission (in France - 16 months - MTC is 2 months), so my language skills were accelerated to those of the others I was in the MTC with.<br>  <br>  Those that are most successful are those who study the language daily, read their scriptures and pray in the language.  As Josh said - having your first dream in the language (that isn't a nighmare of not being able to talk to people - LOL) and thinking in the laguage are big milestones.  <br>  <br>  I have been home for 14 years this year and still am fluent, still read and pray in French and use my language that I learned - it is an incredible opportunity to learn a language with the peopel that speak it - and grow to love the land that we are calle to serve in.|`|WyICbuPqaa	My experience at the MTC was very frustrating, but I did exercise faith, and my ability to learn expanded.  I struggled more than anyone, but at some point something clicked, and I was able to do those things I needed to do.  I exercised faith in two ways; I studied hard - without much evidence that it was helping, and I prayed hard - also without much evidence that it was helping.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	I knew how to say Ferrari, Lasagna, Pizza, and Mafia - I had to learn the rest.<br>  <br>  In the MTC they teach you an accelerated language course and you read the scriptures in your new language each night and pray and speak in it.<br>  <br>  Usually a lot or prayer is involved as it's normally impossible to learn a language in such a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  Still, once I got to Italy there are so many dialects I wondered what language they taught me in the MTC - so you pick up on it fast since the only way to speak your message is by speaking your language.  It's nice to be able to say what and when you want to eat as well so all these things provide motivation.<br>  <br>  I had my first Italian dream after about 3.5 months in Italy, and hit the point in which I was thinking exclusively in Italian after about 5 months.  I actually had a hard time speaking english upon my return.|`|GPn55rjTaa	My nephew is in the MTC right now learning spanish.  He took 4 years of it in HS and said they covered all of it the first 4 days!!<br>  <br>  His scriptures are in spanish only.

Most missionaries are completely fluent before they hit their 1 year mark.|`|AA11636949	When they are at the MTC they are submerged inthe laguage.

What kind of snake oil are you trying to sell me?|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Here is something in my own experience.  I once lived for two years in a mining camp.  It was not quite 30 miles from town on a good road. The town had a few churches and ministers.  During the time I was there I never saw one single minister or church member come out to the camp to invite any of the people living there to a church.  They never even came out with a hand lettered sign to put on the noticeboard to say when services were held.  The only person of that kind was a Roman Catholic priest who was there looking for his brother and he did not live in the town. <br>  <br>  You say God died for us.  Why did that have to happen?  Is it because of "original sin"?  But isn't original sin something proposed by the same people who said God died for us? Isn't that a circular situation? What if you do not believe in original sin? <br>  <br>   As for other sins, are not many of them proposed as sins by the same people who claim that God died for them?  <br>  <br>  Suppose I "look with lust" on my neighbor's wife.  That's supposed to be a sin, isn't it?  Ten seconds later I am wondering whether to prune the roses now or to wait till the weather warms a little.  Now I can see the harm if I obsess over her for months, but a passing thought does nobody any harm.|`|SuBRC6BJaa	I noticed you offered no evidence to back up these claims.|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	You know the point that never made sense to me, is that ok Jesus is the son of God, and God is all knowing, supposedly, right?

By our own decision;<br>  Bad things / dark side of us are also happened because of us our self.<br>  anythings happen by a cause and in  purpose.<br>  <br>  Have you ever read, see or know about "foot prints" ?<br>  it says, and clearly explain, when we are in our most weakness, there is God present to lift us up.|`|sWXrnErnaa	No I can honestly say no!<br>  <br>  Yes I do believe in A Greater Power but no I dont believe that the God/s are always their for us.<br>  <br>  I know a good person who lived a spiritual life and believed in God and I ended up in a relationship where she was getting beaten almost every day by her outwardly good husband. <br>  <br>  She prayed and prayed for God to help him to gain control of his temper, she prayed to be a better wife, she prayed to be a better servant to God, she did everything, until one night when he was beating her and she became angry and asked that if any of the old Gods the Ancient Ones that God had replaced were there to help her as God had failed her.<br>  <br>  Then and only then did she feel the loving presence of a Mothers Love and feel save and secure, After that night she found increasing strength and courage and she left her abusive husband, she saved her children from that life and over time her study of the old ways continued and she found her way to Paganism, She went on to become a High Priestess and her life has never been better.<br>  <br>  .....so simply no the God has NOT always been there........|`|qgkdnG3faa	Yes, he has.

But YOU know its not true, so why does it matter what other people think?<br>  <br>  I think its really good that you are naturally confident, that is something I have had to work at. The most likely scenario is that people are jealous of your confidence, so they judge you.<br>  <br>  Just don't listen to the rumours. I know this matters to you right now, but next week someone else will be the topic of gossip, and the lies about you will be forgotten.<br>  <br>  Anyway I hoped that helped, and keep doing what you're doing, it sounds like you are living your life well <br>  =)|`|cxn7QZ3maa	Because in this post World War II era people don't appreciate their blessings and the value of life anymore and we all have a sense of entitlement for no reason.

When a person has low self confidence, one way to "pump themselves up" is to dog on others. When someone calls someone a name or accuses them of something it's usually a reflection of what they themselves are feeling inside. I wish I could say it is a phase but as I've grown older (43 now) I have witnessed little change in this area. Even in the business world! And I think girls or women can be the worst offenders of this.|`|s62iQmjdaa	People just judge thats how they were brought up.

Some people come from bad backgrounds and some are just having bad days. People who are mean lead a very different life from you, they are very pessimistic people who only care about themselves and want to feel better about their insecurities by picking on those who seem "perfect" and are living a more fuller life. It is wonderful to hear someone of your age questioning the way society works. What you need to learn at the moment is to IGNORE it. It is the best thing to do as well as getting support from friends and family. NEVER EVER think your lesser of a person than anyone else. We are all equal. <br>  Don't be sensitive about people disliking you because those people are always going to be around and you need to stick up for yourself when they are around. <br>  Perhaps think about getting rid of facebook - it is only a distraction to your life and no point. Don't add people you don't agree with either.<br>  You have to act like the mature one who doesn't care or those things are going to let you down.<br>  Good luck|`|xrf7ScCTaa	I don't understand it either, and its SO frustrating.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	well of course we are human beings and are meant to hate eachother at first glance like hey look at that little slut over there man a hate her glasses lets tell everyone she drinks. thats how that imature crap starts so heres a word of advice dont give a crap what ppl think of u just live ur life and do what u think is right cuz after high school all these ppls little possy and i was a cheerleader crap means diddly squat and u gotta live out ur hard life like every other jack off in the world.

Well, I know for one that you definitely need to force yourself to read the Bible even if you don't feel like it...whenever I read the Bible I always am glad I did.

I was catholic..... and I was so controlled I actually ran the opposite direction... couldnt stand the judgement.... now I am on the fence... dont know what to believe....

If you are truly interested in god then this should help you. <br>  <br>  I am trying to following the same thing like this.

We are strengthened when we read God's Word and if we only knew the power of prayer, what results we would have. The enemy(the devil) will do everything possible to keep us from gaining Spiritual strength and knowledge and victory over our situation, but he is a defeated foe and sometimes we have to really press to do what we know is best. Just keep seeking God the best you can and keep that prayer line open, I believe that your passion for God is still there and when you think He is not there, that is when He is carrying you through the storm in your life. I am claiming the victory for you right now in the name of Jesus and I ask the Lord to restore the joy of your Salvation to you and to help you find peace in knowing that He is with you always. When you need encouragement, Psalms is where you will find that David had to encourage himself sometimes, maybe read Psalms 23, 27, 51 & 121 for starters. God Bless and I hope you will find some  peace, love & strength as the Lord sends love and support your way. God Bless!|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	What specifically is going on in your life?

What did you always and now go to? Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, Jewish, SDA...?<br>  I'm a Seventh Day Adventist. Why don't you try going to one of them. God loves you, never forget that. <br>  The Bible verse that cheers me up is Revelation 4:8b, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come" (NKJV).<br>  Well, I know its for a bit younger of age, but www.guidemagazine.com is nice and they have a chat and discussion board that can really cheer you up (guidemagazine is SDA). Also check out the SDA teen magazine Insight. I've been SDA for four years and was too young to remember what I learned at other churches.<br>  Just open your heart, and God will answer. When He is in with you, He will not leave unless you ask Him too. Allow Him to open the door whenever Satan comes knocking, or Satan will burst past you and bother you. God will keep him out. <br>  Being a christian is believing and having faith in God. Its not something you forget, its something you lose. <br>  God Bless and I'm praying for you again. :)|`|RyhluHk3aa	What you are feeling is guilt, because of the way that you have been taught to believe. Sitting in church every Sunday does not necessarily make you a better Christian. Seeking the truth will bring you closer to God than you ever thought possible.<br>  <br>  Do you know that there are 2 different religions, and 2 different gospels in the Bible? It's true. Did you know that they are each distinctly different from one another, and not meant to be mixed? Do you know that 99% of churches DO mix them, and that the mixing of the two is what causes ALL doctrinal differences, as well as an unscriptural "need" for different denominations?<br>  <br>  There is ONE scripture that clears up most all seeming contradictions in God's word. That scripture is Galatians 2:7. Paul writes that the gospel of the uncircumcision (the Gospel of the Grace of God) was "commited unto me", just as the gospel of the circumcision (the Gospel of the Kingdom) was commited unto Peter.<br>  <br>  The risen Christ chose Paul to be the apostle to the Gentiles. He preached a different gospel than that which Peter and the 12 preached.<br>  Peter's gospel was for the nation Israel (the Jews).<br>  Paul's gospel was for the Body of Christ (both Jew and Gentiles).<br>  <br>  Paul directed us to study to show ourselves approved unto God, to be workmen that will not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br>  <br>  That means to know what is meant for Israel, and what is meant for the Body of Christ.<br>  We, today, are members of the Body of Christ. We are under grace, needing only to believe that the Lord Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and was resurrected to jusify us to the Father.<br>  <br>  Study these truths. Seek out the difference.

I think it's normal and many fall away thinking there is a better life.. I did :)  Then the truth is I never had a good relationship, or roots in the first place it was easy to fall.  I was good at that and soon learned that I did need God!  <br>  <br>  What is a true Christian anyway?  Its about relationship and following Christ.  <br>  <br>  I will definitely pray for you and am proud of you for asking for help.  I'm not going to tell you what to think but I will help you if you'd like talk it out and figure out why.  Often when I come to a place where I'm feeling disconnected even now I have to step back and look at what I'm doing.  What am I truly focusing on?  Is there music or even a TV show that has taken the place of God and our time together?  Heck yeah because God doesn't leave us.  We are the ones that turn from Him.  We are not going to feel that fire all the time but its okay because our relationship with Christ should not be based on emotion.  It needs to be much deeper.  We get that by learning (even when we don't want to).  By talking to Him, there is not a special way to pray.  No way that God will hear us better.  He is there and listening but does things in His time and sometimes as I've learned the answer is no.  Often He is saying no because He has something MUCH better for us.  <br>  I can't fit this all in here and of course there are many comforting verses but you need more than that.  You need to talk.  I'm here:)  <br>  I'm subscribed to many devotionals and get them in my email daily.

That's one way of feeling closer, going out somewhere and building a new church to bring more people into his light. If you can't make Sunday mornings, go to the night sessions. Also don't just ask for support from just Christians, all of us are followers of Abraham, I'm Jewish, and my roommate is Muslim. Feel closer to G-d by getting closer to all his children. Just remember how much the lord has given you, every little thing can make you feel closer. You could get more people to recycle and clean up his gift to us, tutor little kids after school, this summer become a camp counselor. This world is full of oppurtunties to feel closer to our lord, so start taking them.<br>  <br>  Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your G-d goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.-Deuteronomy 31:6<br>  <br>  Rise up; this matter is in your hands.

Don't worry, most people go through that, sometimes more than once. My Auntie stopped coming to church for ages, and now she is back stronger than ever.<br>  You are already on the road to recovery. By going to Church, you are showing God that you want to do his will, and that is the biggest step! For your comfort, read Matthew 7:7-8. You are knocking at the door, God will open it for you. Come back to him the way that suits you. There is no exact way to pray or anything like that. The next time you pray, simply tell God everything the same way you would tell your best friend. He is your friend - don't doubt that. I have listed some sites below that have articles in them that may uplift you and make you feel strong again.<br>  I went through a phase about six months ago when I almost hated God. I blamed him for everything. I refused to pray, read the Bible, or go to church. Then one day, I hit the point when I realised that this was getting me nowhere - I had always felt better when I felt at one with God. Many of these articles helped me, too. Now I feel so strong with him. I pray about twice a day - when I wake up, and just before I go to bed. You just need to tell God everything, and ask him for everything you need. It will take time for you to fully heal, but I am certain you will. Just keep working at it!!<br>  <br>  I really hope that you come to feel at peace with yourself and God soon, so that you can feel happy again. Let me tell you, that the amount of happiness I am feeling at the moment since coming back to church is far beyond any other feeling of happiness I have ever felt at any other time!!|`|MF9YknDYaa	Which god?Allah,Zeus,Odin etc..?|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Sounds to me like your getting smarter|`|IL70DsC1aa	psalm 94:9 theme is if GOD has created our eyes To see and Ears to listen THEN how we can even imagine That the creator of our EYEs Can't SEE and creator of our ears Can't LISTEN.do u know?Jesus is more eagurley waiting to hear our prayers.have you ever seen any sick child praying to Mon/Dad for treatmen?may be never.coz father/mother have more concern to their children.and according to isiah 49:15 "a mother can even leave her new born child but i cant leave you".<br>    One night in 2008 ,ludhiyan,punjab,India. i was sharing the same livng word of God with a lady(20) who was on her bed since last one year.Her right leg was paralized and was dead completely.she could not see the sun even sins last one yr .she was unable to move a bit even.As i was sharing about the LIVING word of God.and living JESUS who can feel .she was amazed to know that GOD is living.and as she started reading the Living word of God(punjabi)she knew that JESUS had paid the price of her sins and already bore all of her sickness.so fifth day she started talkin/praying to JESUS as "JESUS PAPA "and started weeping coz her father and mother had left her since long time with her husband.and all the ppl aroun her use to make a fun of her saying DISABLE AND "Dead womb lady".so she use to weep before Living Jesus.and started asking for DEATH.But she was not aware of that the TREE she was shaking have never fruit of death but it always have fruits of life,I kept preaching abt living jesus and isiah 53:4:5, and one night at aprox 12:10 when we were praying and abt to return back.suddenly she started saying something my ears could not accept.Her eyes were closed and she started saying that brother. JESUS HAVE come and He is standing just before me.i was amazed to hear that.offcourse i was preaching abt the Living  Jesus challanging that He is living.but when it was so .i was amazed.and AGAIN she (sister mandeep) said bro. Jesus is standing befor me  and asking me to hold His hands...woooooo.i said Mandeep... just hold HIS HANDS and He will never leave you. its His promise.and suddenly i saw her streaching her hands .her eyes were still closed.and hand were streched .and again she said Bro Jesus is sayin to Get up and stand up holding my hands.woooooooooo.i said pleeeees do this.and amazingly i saw her turning and she was straching her hands like she is holding some ones hand.and stood up on her legs.i was surprised coz her right leg was 100% dead and like stone.and againg i heard her voice "JESUS is asking me to walk by holding His hands" woooooo it was great moment for me i said laudly sister Mandeep moooooooove with JESUS and SUDDENLY she took her first step with her right DEAD LEG.then nex then nex step till aprox 25 steps .there every thing was happening real.and in NATURAL way.JESUS was in SUPERNATURAL but HE was holding Mandeep's hand In Natural form and she was walking in natural mode.her dead leg came to life coz the source of Life(Jesus)was holding her hands.and as she came to her bed again and before openning her eyes she received some thing from Jesus.and later on she said Jesus Gave her a beautiful child.wonderful time it was.Now she is completely healed and and just one moth back i got a phone call with a good news that he is pregnent.<br>  All Glory be to God.<br>      so offcourse we are NATURAL beings .thats why we somtime think that how GOD(supernatural being)can answer. or speak or perform any thing. but the Thing is all the NATURAL BEING have come to existance by the same SUPERNATURAL (GOD).<br>   And GOD is not the matter of discussion but experience.and if GOD Can,t come out of the pages of His Holy books,then what to do with that GOD? IF God can't come out of the pages of the Holy Book in the time of our sorrow and tears then how can He help us?. But Good NEWS is God is living and He who created your EARS can hear you.<br>   i  dont mean to say that i beleave .but i know.. coz i have experienced  and now you too.. coz bible says (psalm 34:8) TEST AND SEE.<br>    *** GOD is not a matter of discussion but EXPERIENCE***<br>    *** GOD created our ears and eyes and HE is able to see and hear***<br>   ***GOD is more eager to listen us ***<br>    SO pls try to spend time with His Living WORD.and with Him.<br>    May God bless you and exault His name and Word in and through you.|`|vRmAMmh0aa	I couldn't drag myself away and had to answer even though you requested not this type of answer.

If you want, I can pray for you as well.  <br>  <br>  Dear God, <br>  Nunley is have trouble reading your word and she no longer feels close to you.  Please draw close to her in her time of need.

You are in adolescence and I rather this happen now than when you are older in college. You can NEVER let God down! He has not forgotten you and the fact that you notice your passion has changed means you ARE close to him. Think of God life a parent figure and put your trust in him to love and keep you, same as you do your parents. At 17 I stopped going to church for almost a year and I believe it ultimately made me stronger. "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Keep calling out to God and he WILL answer you.

Sin separates you from God and if you can find the root of that sin and repent, you'll be all the closer to God. It may be sexual sin, pride, dishonesty, and the list goes on... but if you want to forge a closer relationship with God then there are a few things you should reflect on:<br>  <br>  Is the relationship with your boyfriend based on God?<br>  <br>  Is this relationship going to end in marriage? -To be honest, dating is pointless unless you are planning to marry the man you're dating -if you are not going to marry him, then you should end the relationship and focus on your relationship with God until you are ready to be married.<br>  <br>  This may sound harsh, but it's true -check out some of Mark Driscoll's sermons at Marshillchurch.org -they are all online and you can even download them as podcasts and listen to them on your ipod.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps -and feel free to email me if you have any questions -again I say this all with love for my fellow sister of Christ|`|554cbaad408d4cd105322cde412038daaa	Seems like everybody goes through a phase in their walk with Christ in which they feel like there is a wall between themselves and God.  I have felt this way before too.  You just have to keep praying and reading His word.  You can make it through, and when you are able to break down the wall your relationship will be even better.

I mean you no disrespect, but it really sounds like you've outgrown your current devotion.  You can't force yourself to have faith that doesn't come from inside.  Why would you want to put yourself through that?  Be true to yourself.  Be true to your heart.  Maybe you need to step outside of the Christianity thing for a while to get some perspective and then maybe you'll go back to it or maybe you'll go somewhere else for your peace of mind.

I had that a while ago too.  I think it is because we move away from God, he does not move away from us.  You have to start reading the bible and have a devotional.  Start again counting all your blessings, sing hymns of praise even when you don't feel like it. Mostly ask God to draw his Spirit to you and renew and refresh you.  I found when I was depressed that this would come on. You can't give in to your feelings.  In time, you will feel God's presence once again.  Pray a lot and just talk to God telling him you don't know why you are feeling this way and to help you.  I also asked God not to give up on me.  One can step out of God's will so that you will not feel the warmth of God's love in your life or maybe one have doubts about the Word of God.

That happens.  You will have times of feeling very close and touched emotionally and times you won't feel anything.  <br>  <br>  Don't base your Christianity on your emotions.  It's not about the feelings.  Sometimes it just takes some discipline to move in the right direction.  While it is important for you to stay in God's word, don't overburden yourself so that it becomes a chore.  Be creative.  Do you have times when you could listen to the Bible on CD or ipod?  It's a great alternative to reading and you can do it when you are riding in the car, exercising, or going to sleep.  You might want to try the New Living Bible on CD.  Did you know that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God? (Romans 10:17)<br>  <br>  Also, it's great that you are going with your boyfriend on Wednesday nights.  Maybe you could find a youth group you really like.  Shop around until you find one that fits you.<br>  <br>  If you like a certain kind of music, look for worship music in that style which really moves you.  Try listening for a few minutes during times you are lonely.  Close your eyes and relax.  It can really get you into your prayer life.<br>  <br>  Bible gateway is a bible online that each day has a new bible verse.  Sometimes I like to go to that and just contemplate on that verse.<br>  <br>  In Touch magazine is a free magazine by Charles Stanley which has articles and daily devotionals.

Afghanistan: Taliban Execute English Teacher    In Afghanistans central province of Daikundi, the Taliban militants in Afghanistan have killed an English teacher and hanged his body from a tree.

I told her that assuming that kind of crap was no less rude or ignorant than my old friends, and that if she was going to be a ***** about it, I had a place at my boyfriend's table for Thanksgiving and I could be on the red-eye to California overnight. She shut up about it after that, and we didn't talk through the holiday, but by the time I was packing up again to come home for Christmas, she'd realized that I meant what I said about going somewhere else, and that I wasn't going to change my mind, so she just decided to get over it and she invited me to bring him along to Christmas if I wanted to. Since then, we really don't speak on it, but she knows I stand firm in my position, and it's not a problem. <br>  <br>  My father on the other hand, really only comes to visit when he has to pay for something (my 'rents are divorced) and he was raised in the south with a KKK member for a dad, so I figure, since I only see him about once a year anyways, I'll just let him get old and die believing I'm straight. No reason to make the old guy want to put a gun to his son's head if I don't have to.|`|ds78ZSSRaa	I have a lesbian tattoo on my lower belly. I was stretching and my shirt came up and she saw it.  She asked me what it was, I played dumb (who are you going to believe mom? your eyes or your darling daughter?) and never told her.  My family plays nooo part in what I do sexually. Even if its with a man, she will never know.   I will be 80 years old with kids and grand kids and I still wouldn't admit to sex.   In the middle of sex i get disgusted if my mom cross my mind. I completely block family out, picturing a naked female. Its not that hard to concentrate about a naked female with soft skin, licking her own boob while touching her self.

SZdVYrSSaa	This was analyzed by a friend in the psychology department. The female attraction to gay men is twofold, firstly, they feel comfortable with you, because if you aren't trying to sleep with them, you are less threatening, and thus, more likeable... <br>  <br>  Moreover, straight women love confidence, it gets their blood pressure going.<br>  <br>  And this day in age, there is not a whole lot that looks more confident than a guy who is willing to be openly gay. So of course, this transitively seems like a confident male, and inspires natural awe.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it, everyone likes a good posse.|`|n55igpCUaa	Some girls like the "hard to get" thing.

LOL I have gay male friends who are closer than my own brother . That's pretty special.|`|stB94mCHaa	No, you're not crazy. Straight women love gay men and for several reasons. First of all, most gay men are much better looking than straight men. Secondly, women do tend to like that "hard to get" aspect.<br>  <br>  As vulgar, tasteless, and ignorant as the "$hit tunnel" post was, it was a pretty accurate portrayal of loose women and the way they try to turn on anything just to make sure they've "still got it."<br>  <br>  As for the people who commented on your spelling, just think, what is sadder, someone who has enough of a life that they didn't spend hours proofreading their post on Yahoo Answers, or someone who has so much time on their hands that they can waste their time (and ours) with useless posts that ridicule someone else but fail to answer their question?

AA11047076	Jewish race?  Which one would that be?  The black Jews from Ethiopia?  The caucasian Ashkenazi Jews?  The Spanish descended Sephardi Jews?  The Mizrachi Arab Jews?  In short, there is no such thing as a Jewish race and anybody from any ethnicity can convert to Judaism.<br>  <br>  The reality- we are forbidden from treating converts any differently to those born Jewish and they are as holy as anyone else in Israel. You want proof? Ruth, the great grandmother of King David was a convert, a Moabitess- and from her we will eventually have the Mashiach, our ultimate redeemer.<br>  <br>  So, whats the big deal? Why do Jews make it such a big deal to convert? Why the tradition of turning people away three times, hoping they won’t come back? You see- converting others isn’t just about them- it has implications to the person who does the conversion! Converting others to Judaism is actually a massive responsibility for the person who is doing the conversion- and an activity which can lead them to erring and sinning themselves! Why? There is a commandment “Do not place as tumbling block before the blind” Its easy enough to understand at a literal level, but at a deeper level it also means to not do something that will cause another person to err and thus be worse off than they were before.<br>  <br>  Where this comes into play is as follows: Everyone, regardless of religion, has a path to righteousness and a place in the world to come. For the non-Jews, if they behave in a manner that is in line with the 7 Noahide laws, then they will be righteous and merit a place in the world to come- for Jews, it is through the 613 commandments.<br>  <br>  So, coming back to the first point- what is easier, to follow 7 laws or 613 laws? Its a no brainer- 7 laws are much easier to follow. So, when we convert somebody, we are giving them an additional 606 laws that previously did not apply to them previously. Its not just a stumbling block- its a concrete barrier across the road! The person doing the conversion has to educate the convertee well enough that they will know enough about the laws to undertake to follow them, and know how to do so at a practical level- if they don’t, the person is going to err and thus the teacher is in violation of the commandment!<br>  <br>  So making sure someone is serious about conversion is imperative. Turning people away, testing their commitment through lengthy classes and immersion into Judaism; testing their desire, and commitment thus becomes an essential part of the process- ensuring their, and their future teachers, spiritual health. If the person is not serious, and the teacher has not tested them, the teacher is in violation of the commandment and, additionally, has caused another person to sin. If the person is serious- then it is a massive mitzvah to bring them into Judaism.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Jews are not a race, and they never have been. Only anti-Semites, like the Nazis, have ever referred to the Jewish people as a race. Jews come in many ethnicities; there are Chinese Jews, Japanese Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Iranian Jews, Yemeni Jews, Spanish Jews, Portuguese Jews, Mexican Jews, German Jews, Polish Jews, etc. The only thing that ties these people together is their shared Jewish identity. Many of them look nothing alike.<br>  <br>  Judaism is a religion, and the Jewish people are a nation tied together by Judaism and Jewish law, the covenant that G-d gave to them.<br>  <br>  It takes at least a year to become a Jew, and you have to have intensive study with a rabbi of the Tanakh, of Hebrew, and of Jewish customs and traditions. If you want to convert Orthodox, and you've never been circumcised, you have to undergo circumcision at the time you convert also.<br>  <br>  Don't rely on Christians to tell you anything about Jews. Jewish people themselves have to answer you.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: No, Judaism is a religion. Anyone can become a Jew.<br>  <br>  No, reading the Torah does not make you a Jew. Studying for at least a year with a rabbi - showing dedication sincerity and learning about the religion, history and culture.<br>  <br>  No, Judaism isn't racist - anyone can become Jewish.<br>  <br>  In fact, it's less elitist than Christianity and Muslim - you don't have to be Jewish to reach G-d and heaven, anyone who is righteous will. That's why Jews don't try to convert everyone.<br>  <br>  Jews were chosen to show monotheism to the world - G-d asked if they would follow his 613 commandments and He would bless them. It would be difficult and He wouldn't require as much from others but his covenant with Jews would be eternal.<br>  <br>  The Jews chose G-d.<br>  <br>  Christians have a different covenant with G-d through their divine savior.<br>  <br>  Those who say the Jews aren't under the same covenant as they've always been are calling G-d a liar, He said it was eternal.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Jews aren't a race.<br>  <br>  Judaism is a religion; if it wasn't, you couldn't convert, which you can.<br>  <br>  It takes more work to become a Jew than a Christian.

Judaism is a religion, not an ethnicity/race.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	You are asking this on Shabbat, a time when observant Jews will not be on the computer.  <br>  <br>  First let me cover the race thing:<br>  <br>  Being Jewish is not a race:<br>  ----------------------------------<br>  Jews do not share one common ancestry or biological distinction. People of many different races are Jewish.<br>  <br>  Being Jewish is not a nationality:<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  Being Jewish is not a nationality because Jews have been dispersed throughout the world for almost two thousand years. People of many different nationalities are Jewish.<br>  <br>  Judaism is a religion:<br>  <br>  - Anyone can convert to Judaism if they wish<br>  - If someone takes up another belief they are an apostate.<br>  <br>  The controversy comes from a misunderstanding between sociological and biological distinctions. Hitler was the first to try to use biological distinctions (race is irrelevant to biology) in order to provide a reason for his hatred against Jewish people (eg. Jews are 'sub human' because we are a separate race).<br>  <br>  Biologically, having common haplotypes is not indicative of race. If that were true then inherited genetic occurrences like polydactylism (six fingers) would also be defined as races. <br>  <br>  My religion is Judaism<br>  My race is Caucasian<br>  My ethnicity is Polish/Syrian<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Chosen People":<br>  ----------------------------<br>  You seem to have a Christian interpretation to the "chosen people" concept.<br>  <br>  Judaism maintains that there are MANY paths to God. We don't proselytize because we believe that you do not have to be Jewish to be a righteous person.<br>  <br>  The "chosen people" refers to the fact that we *chose* to accept the 613 commandments.<br>  <br>  Have you ever purchased a cell phone from a store?<br>  <br>  Usually, you have to sign a contract, which outlines certain specific terms and laws that you have to abide by. When you sign this contract you are legally *choosing* to adhere to its' terms. If you break the contract however: You are likely to get harsher penalties as a result.<br>  <br>  The same is true for Jewish people: By choosing to adhere to the 613 commandments, we are bound in an eternal contract with God. This means that if we break contract we are subject to harsher penalties as a result. This is also true for someone who converts to Judaism.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, it's really the short end of the stick.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  We're the racist ones? Are you fricking kidding me?<br>  <br>  Jewish people were the ones that RECEIVED two inquisitions, constant persecution, pogroms, expulsions, The Holocaust (not exclusive to Jews), food bans (not exclusive to Jews), The Grenada massacre etc..<br>  <br>  Do you need a history lesson or something? <br>  Educate yourself: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitis...</a>|`|zTWmbN4Waa	chosen to suffer... chosen to suffer|`|gGUDC1fYaa	I think you may want to post this a different time.

That doesn't lead to understanding, so we need to sort those first.<br>  <br>  The idea that Judaism is a race comes out of a 19th cen shift to recast religion-based 'Jew-hate' as something pseudo-scientific. It was Hitler of course who popularized it, yet few people are willing to acknowledge that he's their source for the idea.<br>  <br>  The idea that 'chosen' means elite or exclusive comes out of Christianity's recasting of Jewish ideas into forms that suited their own agenda. We understand that all peoples have their own ways, their own roles in the world, as it were. Our understanding is that we were chosen for, or perhaps more accurately that we chose, the path that is Judaism. That's our covenant, other peoples have their own.<br>  <br>  In contrast, Christianity (with its Roman-begot imperial mindset) recast the Jewish idea of covenant as exclusive so that they could claim to take it over. It's a gross misrepresentation of Judaism, but few Christians understand us well enough to realize that.<br>  <br>  The Jewish view is that all people have a place in the 'world to come', whatever that may or may not be. There's no need to convert or anything like that. Live YOUR life as well as you can.|`|DTog0VZWaa	There are a lot of errors in your information.  But first it's Shabbat, & many Jewish people won't be on to answer.  So if you leave your question open a few days -- there'll be people along to answer.<br>  <br>  The biggest error in your information is that you asked CHRISTAINS what Jews believe.  The concepts of "chosen" was you described as special & special treatment is CHRISTAIN - not Jewish.  The idea of "promised land" as being warranted is also CHRISTIAN & not really reflective of how Judaism sees things.<br>  <br>  The error is that Jews as a "race" is an anti-semitic one that Hitler pushed.  It's still floating around & lots of people don't realize it where it came from.<br>  <br>  It's odd that you are new to religion, yet you go so quickly to calling Judaism racist.  Usually when learning, one is slow to accuse or even question people or something possiblity offense.  Do you know much about the history of Judaism & persecution against Jews?  I've met people who think of the Holocaust & that's it - but it's 2000 plus years of being beaten & killed & chased out of countries & vilified & hated -- all for not being Christians or for merely existing.  It's one of the oldest & most deep hates there is on this planet.  <br>  <br>  So, if you have good intentions, I'd beg a little senstivity here & patience.  We can answer your questions -- and the ideas & concepts can get long & interesting.  But you'll need to take time to learn before you make any assumptions.  Also, so you know, Judaism does not prostelyze, so we won't don't care if you convert.  We'll answer questions just to share info to whomever wants to chat.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple sites to start with.  I don't have time to write more right now, but hopefully this will help:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.outreachjudaism.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.outreachjudaism.org</a> (google if I'm a little off.)<br>  <br>  On antisemitism:<br>  <a href="http://www.virtualjudaismlibrary.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualjudaismlibrary.org</a> (google if I'm a little off)<br>  That site has a bit of everything, but also a section on anti-semitism.  <br>  <a href="http://www.adl.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.adl.org</a>|`|iX2TFbuHaa	I think it should be mentioned what it means by "chosen people." The Jewish people, the descendants of Israel (the person), were chosen to be a "light to the nations" and to help fix and uplift all of humanity, not by forcibly converting them like the Christians and the Muslims did, but by establishing a truly great society in Israel, a society connected to the Torah and God, that would inspire and change the whole world. This will happen, perhaps in 200 years or so, give or take a few decades.

c3DqvgE4aa	Mexican War of Independence (1810 - 1821), was an armed conflict between the people of Mexico and Spanish colonial authorities, which started on 16 September 1810. The Mexican War of Independence movement was led by Mexican-born Spaniards, Mestizos and Amerindians who sought independence from Spain. It started as an idealistic peasants' rebellion against their colonial masters, but finally ended as an unlikely alliance between "liberales" (liberals) and "conservadores" (conservatives). The struggle for Mexican independence dates back to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, when Martín Cortés, son of Hernán Cortés and La Malinche, led a revolt against the Spanish colonial government in order to eliminate the issues of oppression and privileges for the conquistadors.[1]<br>  <br>  After the abortive Conspiracy of the Machetes in 1799, the war of Independence led by the Mexican born Spaniards became a reality. The movement for independence was far from gaining unanimous support among Mexicans, who became divided between independentists, autonomists and royalists.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Beginning of the War<br>      * 2 José María Morelos<br>      * 3 Independence<br>      * 4 See also<br>      * 5 References<br>      * 6 External links<br>  <br>  [edit] Beginning of the War<br>  History of Mexico<br>  Coat of Arms of Mexico<br>  Pre-Columbian Mexico<br>  Spanish conquest<br>  Colonial period<br>  War of Independence<br>  First Empire<br>  First Republic<br>  War with Texas<br>  Pastry War<br>  Mexican–American War<br>  The Reform<br>  Reform War<br>  French intervention<br>  Second Empire<br>  Restored Republic<br>  Porfiriato<br>  Revolution<br>  La decena trágica<br>  Plan of Guadalupe<br>  Tampico Affair<br>  Occupation of Veracruz<br>  Maximato<br>  Petroleum Nationalization<br>  Mexican miracle<br>  Mexico 68<br>  La Década Perdida<br>  1982 economic crisis<br>  Zapatista Insurgency<br>  1994 economic crisis<br>  The end of PRI's hegemony<br>   v ? d ? e <br>  A statue of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.<br>  <br>  After conspiracy was betrayed by a supporter, Hidalgo y Costilla declared war against the colonial government on the late night of 15 September 1810. On the dawn of 16 September, the revolutionary army decided to strike for independence and marched on to Guanajuato, a major colonial mining centre governed by Spaniards and criollos. There the leading citizens barricaded themselves in a warehouse. The rebel army captured the warehouse on 28 September, and most of the Spaniards and criollos were massacred or exiled.<br>  <br>  On 30 October 1810, Hidalgo y Costilla's army encountered Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces, fought them and achieved victory. However, the rebel army failed to defeat the large and heavily armed Spanish army in Mexico City. Rebel survivors of the battle sought refuge in near by provinces and villages. The insurgent forces planned a defensive strategy at a bridge on the Calderón River, pursued by the Spanish army.<br>  <br>  In January 1811, Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of Calderón and defeated the insurgent army, forcing the rebels to flee towards the United States-Mexican border, where they hoped to escape.[2] However they were intercepted by the Spanish army and Hidalgo y Costilla and his remaining soldiers were captured in the state of Jalisco, in the region known as "Los Altos". He faced court trial of the Inquisition and found guilty of treason. He was executed by firing squad in Chihuahua, on 31 July 1811. His body was mutilated, and his head was displayed in Guanajuato as a warning to Mexican rebels.[3]<br>  <br>  [edit] José María Morelos<br>  José María Morelos<br>  Declaration of Independence<br>  <br>  Following the death of Father Hidalgo y Costilla, the leadership of the revolutionary army was assumed by José María Morelos. Under his leadership the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were occupied. In 1813, the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and on 6 November of that year, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the "Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America. It was followed by a long period of war at the Siege of Cuautla. In 1815, Morelos was captured by Spanish colonial authorities, trialed and executed for treason in San Cristóbal Ecatepec on 22 December.<br>  <br>  [edit] Independence<br>  <br>  Between 1815 and 1821 the Independence War became a guerrilla war, led by three caudillos: Guadelupe Victoria in Puebla, Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca and the liberal Spaniard Francisco Javier Mina in the center. Javier Mina, encouraged by Servando Teresa de Mier, landed at Soto la Marina and raised an army, but was defeated a few months later and executed near Pénjamo.<br>  Having lost yet another leader, the insurgency was near collapse. They were also faced by the hostility of the criollos, who preferred Spanish rule over the excessive violence displayed by the rebels. In 1820 Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent an army under the criollo general Agustín de Iturbide against the troops of Guerrero in Oaxaca, to crush the rebellion once and forever.<br>  <br>  But this campaign coincided with the successful

QL0FOQMmaa	I am sorry you were abused by your Mom's perverted b/f. Pray to the Lord to heal your mind and your heart and remove that wicked seed that was planted when her b/f did those things to you. And when the thoughts come, you will have to make a conscious choice to cast them down and bring those thoughts into captivity to the obedience of Christ. There is no "magic formula", I wish there was, but the Word of God says that "He keeps him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee." So, you will have to consciously and purposefully detour your thoughts. The Holy Spirit gives us the power to overcome when temptations present themselves. Ask Him for His help. You are an overcomer through Christ and the Word says you are more than a conqueror. What the devil meant for evil, God will turn to good, for them that love Him. One day you will be able to help other young women overcome the things in this area that they have gone through.  You can't change the past, but you can use it to change the future.    God bless you. {{{{{hug}}}}}|`|yxdouOnQaa	While sexual thoughts are completely normal, you would probably benefit from an actual counselor and not just your pastor or equivalent.

But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.    I never could stop having dirty thoughts myself. im to attracted to the opposite sex. no matter how  hard  I tried. never could stop them. some people can others Just cant. Marriage is different now than the bible times.     in the bible times. A man finds a woman attractive. woman finds a man attractive. they go out and marry right then.and they may have only known each other a few hours or maybe a day or 2 .     now its different. people decide  they wanna date a person a long time. so they can mess around and have sex out of wed lock. or get some money out of them. or date them for a while cause they like their car. or mess around till they find a more attractive person. or date for a year or 2 messing around then get hitched. This is the problem with the world today. love in this world is 9 times out of 10 fake. and its all about money,cars,houses and jewelry. why is it that every one is getting divorced nowadays? because they found some body else with more riches and money. the world is a godless society fueled by lusts and earthly pleasures .    Like paul said in Corinthians  if you cant handle it and your body is wanting it.  get married . that's what god made man a woman for to marry and have children. not to go boink around with everybody under the sun.     some advice:  the girl I'm dating right now does not take our relationship serious she says she would like to date 3 or 4  more years then we could marry. when I brought up the thought of marriage after we dated 1 year. all she wants is a roll in hay. she just wants sex. it made me sick to my stomach to learn this. I myself wish I could Just find me a pretty christian woman that i could marry. Because I'm so tired of tramps and sluts and woman who Just want to have a good time. Its Just so wrong on so many levels . but this is how people are nowadays.     beware of these kinds of people. all most people want is sex nothing more than that.     Hold firm. and keep your faith in the lord|`|7ec1bc9eebd90e74998029d14f3ce054aa	You can't stop sexual thoughts, its true that those are started in your body.  They are simply chemical reactions started from things outside of your control.      However, I think i see a potentially more destructive problem.  I used to have a similar problem to you, or so I thought.  I was a stout Christian, and was told that sex, as well as sexual thoughts, masturbation, and lust were all sins.  I was taught to feel guilty and negative about myself and remorseful whenever one of these things did occur.      The problem is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with those things!  It's been proven time and time again by science that not only can do we have no control over those things, but it is actually bad for you to try to shut those feelings out of your life like that.      For me, it was psychologically difficult growing up in a place where I felt that I was living in a den of my own secret sin, and that I was a horrible person for it.  Get those thoughts out of your head now!  And for that matter, maybe you should think about a few more things...      For example, supposedly Adam and Eve were created in the garden of Eden, right?  They were created without the knowledge of Good and Evil, which means they had no moral starting point.  They were born without evil in them, which means they were good, or at least neutral.  Also, Adam and Eve were the only humans, and their only other contact to that point was God.  He tells them, do not eat from this tree.  However, they are deceived by Satan, who tells them that they will gain knowledge and learn things that are being kept from them by eating.      Since they have no experience, knowledge, or even any idea about right and wrong, choices, and consequences, and also have no idea who Satan is or why anyone would tell them something that was not true (up to this point they had only heard truths), how can anyone say that Adam and Eve were responsible?  How can anyone say that they deserved to be cast out, stripped of everything, and damned to hell for being duped?  Especially when they had no experience, no idea, and no warning!  I mean seriously, God didnt even say anything to them like, "Hey, by the way, there's a dude named Satan...  dont listen to him."  No, nothing like that.    The Bible is full of loopholes.|`|YkQNSPdYaa	Don't be so self-preoccupied.

I'm an adult now, much more healed, love God, and have a healthy marriage.  But it took a long time for God to work with me, and heal me.   Sexual abuse messes up your view of sex, and confuses you about your body and your sexual thoughts and feelings.    Sexual thoughts aren't sin, but lust is. Don't feel guilty and shameful, just pray and begin to learn to control your mind and thoughts. The Holy Spirit will help you, just ask him.       Have you turned this man into the police (ie, how long ago did the abuse happen)? Told your family? If not do so, it helps when it's not a secret. Also counseling is an absolute must for this kind of abuse, pray for the right counselor or support group.

No. The whole point OF a religion is to condemn everything that does not surrender to it.    Christianity was intolerant of everything when it first came to Rome, and remains entirely intolerant to this day.

hHjPFxEdaa	If you're shy and hang back from the group, not joining in with the conversations, people may get the idea that you're antisocial. That might be why you don't get included. It may not be that they don't like you but that they don't really know you. The only cure is to force yourself to join in and socialize. It will be hard at first but the more you do it the more comfortable it will get. Start by opening up to one or two people and take it from there.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I agree with Meme.  People don't know how to deal with shy people, because it is difficult to make them out.  The problem is that if we try to stop being shy, if we make an effort, we make mistakes - and that is scary.  People might like us even less!  You just have to keep going, by using trial and error.  Work out what works for you, be firendly, but know when to back off.  You can find hints on the web (try Googling "social skills", etc) but don't take it too seriously - you have to be yourself.  If you appropriately express your good feelings about people, even in small ways, they tend to respond well.  Keep going, and good luck.|`|VEoURHoCaa	maybe you seem stuck up to them, thats prob it i mean some people mistake being shy as being stuck up.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Maybe it's not necessarily that you are "unlikable" but rather you just don't appeal to them.

Once you feel good about yourself, you will consequentially light a spark that shines innerwardly that people will be drawn to.  If you have a good self-image and hold yourself in the highest regard, people cannot help but do the same.  Your being shy is just a small hurdle to overcome, you need to develop good self-worth.|`|t1VthewCaa	There is no common reason for not liking someone. It could be a lot of reasons why someone doesn't like someone else. Don't mind whether people like you or not, God likes you, you should like you and that's all that really matters!
AA11485286	Your statements about honesty are so, but honesty is the foundation of personal relationships, that is, if you want a relationship to be successful.  Honesty promotes trust in a relationship!  If you don't have trust, the likelihood is that there will be a breakdown or dissolution of the relationship.  Wouldn't you agree?  It sounds as though someone has betrayed your trust because of the statements you've made.  One way to overcome trust issues is to set boundaries with those  you intend to share intimacies (e.g., I'd appreciate it if you'd keep this between only the two of us, or I trust that you won't repeat this to anyone).  If those boundaries are disregarded, then you have a recourse of dissolving the relationship when your trust has been violated.  Hope this helps your hurt!!!|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	Some people can't handle the truth....that is their problem and they are the ones that need to get over themselves...|`|UGQ2UiSaaa	yeah i kinda agree with you<br>  but isnt it better to get the truth rather than a lie that might hurt you later?<br>  i think honesty isnt that bad :/
aWcD7Ou5aa	I would rather have a GOOD doctor.  Don't care what they believe.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I don't think I've ever had the topic of religion come up in a doctor's office - and I've had some pretty odd discussions with my doctors. I really don't care if my doctor believes in any gods and which ones when he's off the clock, I only care that they are a good doctor and are personable enough that I'm comfortable around them. Now, I would care if the doctor wanted to substitute valid medical knowledge for faith or if they wanted to insert their own beliefs during the time I'm paying them to treat me.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	I want a skilled doctor one who is alert and knowledgeable.. <br>   The religion, or nonreligious of my doctor is of no concern to me.

ylaGS5EHaa	As that situation would never come up you have just asked a situation impossible question. This question, it seems to me, has been asked to divide and inflame, not for discussion.

We used to call that "bedside manner".  So if the Christian doc has the personal warmth of a garden slug and the atheist doc demonstrates genuine interest and caring for his patients, it's a no-brainer.  Ditto if the opposite is true.<br>  <br>  Honest, I'm not trying to tap-dance this here.  A physician's religion is one of the least important criteria I have for making that choice. I work in health care; maybe that's why.

Case in point, my OB/GYN studied at Creighton University so I knew he was pro-life and pro natural family planning.  The reason is that they are generally more open to natural or alternative treatment plans for reproductive health.  I had a great conversation with him about the different methods of natural family planning and he had some really good insights for me and told me that next time to bring my chart and we could go over it and see if I needed hormone therapy.  These are things that blood tests can't tell so taking daily temperatures can help see trends in hormone levels.  <br>  <br>  The last time I was there we found a deficiency that could be cured with a cream and vitamins.  Now I am in much better health.|`|47cb72348217a23e95b20db38d9cb65faa	I don't choose doctors based off of what religion they follow.

Because of that, I'm in my third year of remission and typing this.<br>  <br>  That's what I care about.|`|c99jycZIaa	I would rather trust someone with my life who believes I was created with a purpose, in the image of my Creator, than someone who believes that I am nothing more than a cosmic accident that blossomed into a talking monkey.|`|UD7d70awaa	I can careless what religion my doctor is as long as he knows what he is doing and isn't a doctor that works in some back alley.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	Christian only because they seam to have more respect for life in general, so they might be driven to try harder|`|AA10574017	just a knowledgable and compassionate doctor.... they can be of any walk of faith!|`|flKkoiwbaa	Why would I care?<br>  <br>  My doc doesn't ask me about my religious beliefs, or lack thereof.

You don't have to give any money to get into heaven. <br>  <br>  Instead, salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|XhzwTpIBaa	I dont know buy I think that this is not about religions, this is about God|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	"Billions" of people are not Christians.  The road is narrow that leads to life and few there be that find it.  A lot of people call themselves Christians who are not, but certainly not billions.  Secondly, people don't go to hell for tithing.   God blesses Christians  who tithe and all their needs are met.  People go to hell for not trusting Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.  John 3:16, Romans 10:13, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, Proverbs 3:5,6.

H6rPxpHWaa	1.Settle on in advance who to tell about being bisexual. It is a good notion to begin with someone who is likely to be helpful meanwhile being bisexual does not inescapably indicate that you will act on your magnetism to members of one gender or the other, you may decide, with some chums and acquaintances, to handle the material on a need-to-know foundation. <br>  2.Think through speaking to a counselor or a close friend about whom to tell and how to tell them. For example, if you still live with your parents and you are just launching to yield to with your sexuality, a therapist might inform you that you do not necessarily need to share every piece of information about your life with people. <br>  3.Sustain the fact that you find people charming without regard to their gender. You may also want to clarify that attraction is not the same as taking action upon attraction. If you are currently dating a member of the other gender, tell them that you don't alternate on genders every other night. <br>  4.State your coziness with your sexual orientation.

They promote immunizations all over the globe, they provide eye care, medical equiptment, emergency supplies, trade schools, emergency relief, food banks, blood drives, etc.  They encourage their members to be honest, hard workers, self sufficient, debt free, good fathers, mothers, children, siblings, and friends.  They encourage them to be engaged in good causes, to give of themselves, to help others, to be kind, and to be christ-like.  They promote education and learning.  They are encouraged to be healthy and take care of their bodies.  <br>  <br>  Lots of great things.

Yes we are a religion of strict guidelines: no tea coffee, no sex before marriage, honesty, wholesome family values.  We believe that htere is life after this life and that this life is a test.  How we live our life here will determine how we will be judged by our Heavenly Father.  Yes, we only allow worthy members to attend temple marriages.  So even members of our church who are unworthy, are unable to attend ceremonies.  Please do not watch the Godmakers, it in NO way represents what we believe. It was made by non members who have no idea what they are talking about. Basically we are people with old-fashioned values and our family is the most important thing to us since we believe that if we live in accordance to what Jesus taught, we can be with our loved ones forever in the next life.  Basically be good, honest, trustworthy and helpful to all mankind.|`|UcHDRtHjaa	First off they wrote their own bible. In no way does this text truly represent what Jesus said. Neither does the bible! LOL Which is blasphemy according to Christians. They have secret handshakes. Their breeding practices are truly an ingenious method of reproducing not just biologically but also as a means of preserving the systematic brain washing that occurs since the time of their first utterances. Many of my friends can tell if someone is a Mormon just by speaking to them Many of them seem to exhibit this strange zombified behavior. In high school every one of them snubbed people unlike them. A very creepy experience watching one trying to relate to a NON Mormon. Now of course this doesn't imply all are like this. Talk to a few though and you will be creeped out by their similarity in speech and mind and thought processes. They believe that after conceiving a certain number of children they will be given their own planet in the afterlife on which they will also be given new bodies that are perfect in every way. Oh the other detail is that the planet is populated by one man and an endless supply of supermodel women in which can be eternally pregnant. Want some good entertainment read about the special underwear they put on. My cousin is Mormon and got married in the church. How nice of them to not allow any non Mormons until after the major ceremony. The let the un-pure ones in afterwards but in no way do yuo get to be involved in the actual ceremony. My grandmother was markedly devastated. How holy they are...how holy they are....  They will vehemently deny most things on this list. Watch the god makers documentary. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU want to stay in the dark about the truth of this cult. Amazing things have been reported by non Mormons those who become excommunicated are hassled and other many scary things. DOC is scary as hell.

joWIgxZpaa	It is possible to explore the symbolism of dreams. You can do a simple meditation technique and try talking to the symbol of your mother, from the dream, and asking her what she meant. Sit somewhere quiet, where you won't be disturbed. Close your eye, and recall the dream and clearly as possible. Focus on seeing your mother. Imagine talking with her, and imagine her replies. The article below will give you some more tips and suggestions for understanding symbolism.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	it means your mother is going to kill you|`|FmazIF6Maa	There is a belief in dream interpretation that all people in your dream represent some part of you. Your mother might represent yourself growing up, becoming an adult.|`|AA11043457	Maybe you remember something that she would have said "I'm going to kill you" over.  Or could she have said that to you in a threat at some point and you recalled it in the dream? <br>  <br>  I'm sure it is not the case but sometimes abusive parents say they will kill a child or that it will kill the other spouse if the child tells.  but that is more often the father than the mother or a stepfather or funny uncle (which is not funny).  <br>  <br>  Could just be a bad dream.  Might have felt guilty about something.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Hope it doesn't happen again.<br>  <br>  Whoops, just noticed this is in folk lore or mythology.  Must be a medean dream after Medea.|`|BYUGkoHoaa	This reminds me of a dream  I had.<br>  <br>  <br>  See about two nights ago I dreamt my previous math teacher and I entered hand to hand combat as  several other previous teachers watching. the thing these teachers had in common were that I didn't get the grades I expected in their classes, which I was pissed about, the most recent being math.Instead of a B I got a B- because I apparently did not got to the board enough times.<br>  <br>  The dream probably means that you and your mother might have some unresolved issue between the two of you.|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, usually others in our dreams represent a part of ourselves. So I would look into what makes you feel matronly- motherly, homey, etc. It could represent your actual mother, but usually it doesn't. Death is a sign of change. So it's possible that this part of you is going to start changing. That, or your mother will act as a catalyst for your change. <br>  <br>  I'd say to think along those lines, and see how they match up with your life.|`|v20S8oSJaa	it could mean u mite live longer|`|18BRtnJ7aa	have fun running... lol jk but to me it seems as though someone close to you is going to turn on you, like a friend might start a rumor or something|`|AA11832714	Maybe it's time to leave home.|`|nHW4QV4Oaa	It means you have issues.|`|INLQHsl7aa	its just a dream...

65QqZBnjaa	InHouse Pharmacy has been serving the community for several years now.  They are quite reliable.  I ordered from their during my transition, mainly to save money.  However, I did so with the approval of my doctor.  Are you seeing a doctor or are you self-medicating?

You should go about it the RIGHT way. Find a therapist first that specializes in gender therapy. They WILL help you and there are therapists in every state.|`|AA12006309	HRT really needs to be monitored, because you're messing with your biological functioning.  Female hormones also increase your chances of breast cancer.  It's not something you really want to mess with on your own.<br>  <br>  Yes, it sucks living in the south (I live in Tennessee, I also have TS friends in Texas and Alabama I think?).  You might consider saving up and moving to a more lgbt friendly area, as unrealistic as that sounds.<br>  <br>  It would be a good idea to get in touch with a gender therapist somehow...

Transitioning is something that's incredibly difficult to do alone.<br>  <br>  Even if you wait until you're more feminized, there's a likelihood you'll still face the same kind of discrimination, harassment and possible violence that faces any transsexual.  It's the South.  Once one person finds out, everyone will find out.|`|bmo2aGbdaa	Inhouse is reliable.  Most of their HRT products are labeled for sale in Australia and New Zealand.<br>  <br>  However,  Please do not self-medicate.<br>  <br>  I thought that I understood the dosages and side effects of HRT.  I self-medicated for 3 years.  I developed phlebitis, which is blood clots in the veins of the foot.  This is quite painful.  If the clots had formed further up in the leg, I would have been at risk of sudden death from a clot breaking lose and moving to the heart and lungs.  I am now under medical supervision.<br>  <br>  Please find a way of doing it under medical supervision.<br>  <br>  You do have the option of going outside of your immediate area to see a doctor for prescribing hormones.  You can then get your meds via mail order/internet.<br>  <br>  Spooky is right that you will still be at risk when you transition.  Word spreads fast in a small town setting, no matter what the actual size is.<br>  <br>  What is your line of work?  Is it readily portable?|`|oPkjMWEPaa	omg, I wouldn't recommend transitioning all on your own, even if you're in the South, you can find support.  I'm in Mobile AL and found an endocrinologist for HRT and a psych for counseling and recommendations. If all you do is get hormones online, how will you monitor the hormone levels changing in your body? Who will have timely information in case of complications? Who can offer other perspectives on how to go, and where, and who to see? I've found all of those things and more in my doctors and friends who know what I am and am trying to achieve.  Look for others to talk to and get their advice and support to make your transition happier and healthier.|`|rLAwas8Raa	Taking Estrogen is not dangerous to you really, it is taking additional Testosterone that can kill you. However, Estrogen is a prescribed drug so even if you can get it mailed in you can also get arrested for doing so (law is against the recipient since US cannot prosecute out of country suppliers). You cannot even claim to be bringing needed meds over the border because you have no diagnosed ailment to justify FDA meds or non-FDA meds.<br>  <br>  Every southern state has a large MTF support group, or several. I live in Tennessee, the state notorious for murdered MTFs and a strict law against changing birth certificates, yet even we have a publicly accessible MTF support group with medical providers in every major city (Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga). There is NO WHERE in US that you can live without a MTF support group being a couple hours away, and there are even more online right here on Yahoo (even meetings around Alaska, Montana, Alabama, etc). FTMs are less represented but Knox Boyz of East TN has been active in getting their care for over 10 years. So basically I think you have made zero effort to find a support group, go to a therapist to get okayed for HRT, and therefor no doctor has been properly approached for treatment. And quit frankly, sounds like you are in a recent obsession fit as opposed to "I have always known I am female inside, I cannot stand living like this anymore!" <br>  You have lots of options, and you only used "suicide" to get attention for your lazy whining.  You need counseling for more than to get hormones.

Every prayer meeting, every Bible study, every home church is a true church in His eyes. The Catholic Church does not have a lock on salvation.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic church also has many doctrines that they teach that clearly violate Scripture.<br>  <br>  I will only point out one huge (and little known) example;<br>  <br>  In 1302, Pope Boniface VIII in his Papal Bull "Unum Sanctum" declared himself to be one and equal with God, and proclaimed himself to be God. He was speaking "ex cathedra" (infallibly) and therefore bound every Pope (Pontiff) after him to this doctrine. He said;<br>  <br>  "The Roman Pontiff judges all men, but is judged by no one. We declare, assert, define and pronounce: To be subject to the Roman Pontiff is to every creature altogether necessary for salvation...that which was spoken of Christ ‘thou has subdued all things under his feet’, may well seem verified of me...I have the authority of the King of kings. I am all and above all, so that God Himself and I, the Vicar of God, have but one consistency, and I am able to do all that God can do. What therefore, can you make of me but God? <br>  <br>  Man exalting himself to be equal with God, and proclaiming himself to be God? According to Paul, this is exactly what the Antichrist is supposed to do;<br>  <br>  II Thessalonians 2:4<br>  <br>  4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.<br>  <br>  <br>   And this was the sin of Satan also, believing himself to be equal with God;<br>  <br>  Isaiah 14:12-14<br>  <br>  12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! <br>  <br>  13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: <br>  <br>  14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. <br>  <br>  <br>  So by Boniface VIII's blasphemous proclamation, every Catholic must believe that the Popes are equal with God, or they are not subject to the Roman Pontiff (Pope) and therefore cannot receive salvation. <br>  <br>  And Man being equal with God is found in Scripture where? <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a church that follows the Scriptures as written, in context, and you can't go wrong. You are right in that there are many churches that inject man-made doctrines into their beliefs and fall into serious error, falling under Paul's prophecy of;<br>  <br>  I Timothy 4:1-3<br>  <br>  1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; <br>  <br>  2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; <br>  <br>  3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.<br>  <br>  (Remember, the Roman Catholic Church forbids its priests to marry)<br>  <br>  Also;<br>  <br>  II Timothy 4:3-4<br>  <br>  3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; <br>  <br>  4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <br>  <br>  <br>  If need be, find some like-minded believers and have Bible studies with them, for in Jesus' eyes, that is a church and He will be with you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps?|`|JXMpZiwxaa	I'd recommend praying the rosary.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15.

To leave the church would be to turn your back on Christ.<br>  <br>  <<Any other Catholics that still attend church that don't buy into everything it teaches?>><br>  <br>  I don't like everything it teaches, but since I believe that it was founded by Christ, it follows that everything it teaches is from Christ.  Thus, I try to comply with the rules that I don't like.  Just because I don't understand some rules doesn't mean that God has no reason for them.<br>  <br>  <<-The "us vs. them" belief that everyone else is on the wrong path.>><br>  <br>  Pretty much every religion has this basic belief.<br>  <br>  <<-The dangerous anti-birth control rules invented by men of the church>><br>  <br>  And what is dangerous about it?  STD's?  The church also teaches that one is not to have sex outside of marriage, which is a great way to stop the spread of such diseases.  If people actually followed the rules, there'd be no trouble.  So does not your issue reside more with people's refusal to listen to the rules than with the rules themselves?<br>  <br>  <<-That only men should be priests.>><br>  <br>  Well the church doesn't have the power to change that, so you can't blame it.<br>  <br>  <<-The idea that the church is the only way to God.>><br>  <br>  Again - this is a belief held by most religions.  However, in the Catholic Church, if a person does not know this "fact" through no fault of their own, then they still may find God.  He is merciful after all.|`|vmOyWzilaa	The first thing wrong is Jesus did not found the Catholic church.<br>  If you read the Bible and know anything about Jesus, He was a Jew and went to the Jews. (No such thing as Catholic then)<br>  After some of the Jews (not all) rejected Him as their Messiah His gospel was given to the Gentiles also (non-Jews).<br>  God plainly says in the Bible Deuteronomy 4:2 : Not to add to or take anything away from His words.<br>  When any religious leaders add to or takes away they are to be accursed. The Catholic church adds their own bible {teachings} to the real Bible, we only need the real Bible.<br>  Galatians 1:9-10<br>  "For if he who comes and preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received {from scripture} let him be accursed"<br>  When a religious leader tells you something ask where it is in scripture, if it's not there don't listen to them and don't take their explanation, pray and ask God yourself to reveal what His word is saying to you, trust me if you are sincere God will reveal the truth to you.<br>  #1  "us vs. them" The Bible tells us in 2 Peter 1:20 " But know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation"<br>  "AND THE CATHOLICS DO THIS"<br>  <br>   #2 The idea that the church is the only way to God...<br>  "THE ONLY WAY TO GOD IS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST"<br>  Acts 4:12 "And there is salvation in "no one else" for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved"<br>  Jesus will save you in your living room, on the road etc. it's not where you are, it is the sincere asking God to forgive you and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior, then living for Him.<br>  Remember the one thief on the cross next to Jesus, Luke 23:42-43 he believed in Jesus and Jesus told him " Truly I say to you today you shall be with me in paradise" <br>  He was not in a Catholic church.<br>  <br>  Their teaching to pray to Mary is a sin.<br>  Jesus said in John 14:6 "Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father, but through Me"<br>  Now they will say they are honoring her and she is close to God, No one is closer to God than Jesus! when they pray to Mary {or any saint} it is dishonoring the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross for us. He died not just to cleanse us of our sin but to be our great high priest, our Intercessor to God.<br>  If you sincerely read the Bible you will see so many things they are teaching that is wrong.<br>  There are so many Catholics that have left that religion and go to non-denominational churches that just teach the scriptures and do not put man made rules and traditions on people that have nothing to do with your salvation.<br>  Jesus said in Luke 6:39 " The blind will lead the blind and they both will fall in the ditch"<br>  This means Blind leaders of churches that do not teach the truth will lead people that do not get in the scriptures themselves and they both will go to hell.<br>  As for communion {Lords Supper} ask God first to forgive you of your sins before partaking and you can take communion any time you want, it is not for them to decide for you if you can partake or not.<br>  Also, the Catholic church had rules people had to follow concerning their salvation, but then change them when they wanted, if it concerned your salvation with God it couldn't be changed.... God never changes<br>  Always get in the Bible yourself and read the scriptures, or you can be lead the wrong way.<br>  Read James 1:5-6.... For wisdom.<br>  Also, When you die if you go to heaven the tag Catholic/or whatever religion will fall off, if you go to hell it will burn off, so it doesn't make much sense to tag ourselves with a religious name tag. Jesus is the only name tag we all should wear.<br>  God bless and keep you.|`|q4JaBnQuaa	I think that you should still be catholic i am but i disagree with a lot of things also like the us and them thing...and most of the stuff you said but that does not mean should should break away from them because most churches are like that and if the are not they might be even more strict and stuff I know it should not be like this but just don't belive those things go said let the children walk towards me so by going to chruch you are but by them saying that there forcing you to walk in one way i belive there are many paths.....but in the end do what you feel is right|`|RYoOwFJ9aa	You should study your bible and the history of Christianity and take a class in the catechism of the church before making any decision to leave the church.

I am not saying they are wrong, but it is better that you investigate some other religions that match your beliefs. My grandfather used to be Catholic, but left and became a Mormon. I am Mormon, too. You really should look at your options - ask people about their beliefs, and see if you agree. You certainly don't have to choose Mormonism, there may be another religion out there that you agree with more.

The birth-control issue was a big one for me.  But when I took the pre-martial classes where the philosophy was really explained, I started to look at it differently.  Personally, I didn't leave the Church over birth control.  I just struggled with it for years.<br>  <br>  As for the idea that the Catholic Church is the only way to God, this is not a Catholic doctrine.  The Catholic Church believes that the only way to God is through Christ and that it has the best way to get to Christ.   But before you condemn that as arrogant every other denomination believes that too.  <br>  <br>  I'm still not totally at peace with the only men should be priests thing, but I look at more key issues for me.<br>  <br>  I look at:<br>  <br>  - sacraments (which I believe in, other Christian denominations have fewer)<br>  <br>  - the Eucharist particularly.  I believe we are imitating Christ when we celebrate this and following his commandments in the bible.<br>  <br>  - years of biblical study and apostolic succession <br>  <br>  - the litergy and litergical cycles, I love that the mass is so Bible based and that those who attend mass at different Catholic churches are still hearing the same message as at others.  We are part of Christ's world wide Church in a very literal sense.<br>  <br>  - books were not removed from our Bible for political reasons.  That always just upset me.<br>  <br>  But anyway, these are the reasons that I feel that this is the best Church.

In fact, Constantine and many subsequent Emperors were unable to push their personal agendas through. Constantine tried and failed to impose Arianism, Justinian tried and failed to overturn the Church's decision against the Monophysites, etc. All bishops were indendent, and all decisions affecting any are larger than a single city had to pass by the majority vote of all bishops in the diocese. Even a patriarch had to submit to the vote of a council. Individual bishops had to be accepted by the congregation. Any bishop who remained in office against the will of the congregation was immediately excommunicated. There were also many restrictions placed on the clergy. A bishop, for example, was only allowed to govern the diocese where he was initially ordained. <br>  <br>  Second, Christian organizations were granted certain imperial benefits, such as free book printing, free church building (under certain conditions), and tax breaks. In order to facilitate the distribution of imperial benefits, a congregation had to meet the official definition of a Christian church. This definition was actually written into Roman law, and was determined by an Ecumenical Council (a majority vote of all bishops in the Empire). Churches who did not meet the official definition were still free to practice whatever they wanted, but they were not entitled to imperial benefits under Roman law.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, this issue is one of the most misunderstood elements of Christian history. The policies are pretty clear from the writings of the Church Fathers and historians, as well as the actual canons of the Ecumenical Councils. For more information on this complex period, read the "History of Byzantium" by John Julius Norwich, and then follow that up with Eusebius on Church History and the life of Constantine, and the acts of the first four or five Ecumenical Councils.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!

Ax54M1Dhaa	First I'll say that I actually I'm not 100% for or against the legalization of marijuana but your points for its continued illegality are pretty poor.<br>  <br>  1. DEA employees.  Just because 70% of arrests by the DEA are pot smokers doesn't mean that 70% of its employees are actually designated to the task.  Haven't you considered the fact that pot is the most commonly used illegal drug and therefore statistically would have the highest number of arrests?  Also, if it was legalized I doubt those men and women would lose their jobs even if they were all assigned exclusively to pot busts, they'd simply be reallocated to other task, the DEA is understaffed, they would lose people.<br>  <br>  2. True it would be difficult to tax it however this is not a good enough reason not to legalize it.  If legalize it would make plenty of money off taxed pot to make up for the stuff that slips by.  People would by the taxed because it would be far more convenient for them and the demand for illegal import would go down.  Also, the government would likely step up resources to stop illegal importing if the smoking of it was legalized so it could make more on taxations.<br>  <br>  3. Racism, really, how 1965 of you.  Its down right paranoid to think racism is the reason it is still illegal.  Opium is illegal and that was THE European drug of choice.  And did you forget that the Caucasians got tobacco from the Native Americans?<br>  <br>  4.  You don't think that the Tobacco industry would be the first companies to start selling it?  Everyone of them has ad campaigns and brand names already prepared should it become legal.|`|JYXDj402aa	i wish it was legal. oh well. if its legal or not im still going to smoke it.<br>  <br>  if marijuana was legal the goverment could grow it and sell it like tobbaco. they would make money. and "criminals" selling it would be off the streets.<br>  look at amsterdam.|`|nqcnylFpaa	are world is rotten enough as it is drugs are one of the main causes all it does is cost chaos and death to me the growers are scum and they deserve to be punished not rewarded marijuana cost my little cousins life cause that's all he wanted was to get high he would do anything to get it even if that meant stealing from people which he stole from the wrong person and was shot and died i found that deal a week after his funeral and now he is in prison its to good for him he deserves to be six feet under not a 17 year old boy that is why i hate all drugs if it is ever legalized are government is no damn better then people who grow it|`|LCdOocBAaa	Pot planters kill OFF forrests, just google the mexican weed growers and you will see it all.<br>  <br>  Smoking weed is horrible for your skin, your lungs..<br>  <br>  I just don't get why people are so unoringal as to try it out and try to do what every other stupid kid is doing.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	No **** buddy.

Because it is so damn easy to grow in a cupboard(closet) it would be next to impossible to make much of a profit on it from selling it in store because if it was legalized so many more people would become home growers.<br>  <br>  They say it is kept illegal due to the fact that it has a 0.5% tendecy to increase the chances of become schizophrenic where as alcohol has 5% tendency to increase the chances. What I find stupid that cannabis has recently became a class B drug up from a class C drug on those grounds. They grade cannabis on the same level as AMPHETAMINES and regarded higher than ketamine and other tranquilisers.<br>  <br>  I am quite tired now and will add more later.

I'm not saying you should. But I do know that when I started taking anti-depressants my dreams became extremely vivid and most were nightmares.

Also note if you often happen to wake up at 3:00 in the morning. This is when supposedly spirits are most active.

Mnm35sjNaa	The gay community should learn a very clear lesson from the black community.  The follow true story will explain what I mean . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	It's misguided hatred. The LDS Church was just one of many organizations which formed a coalition. But these people have singled out just the LDS Church. <br>  <br>  There's no outrage directed the other members of that coalition: the Roman Catholic Church, Knights of Columbus, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, a group of Evangelical Christians led by Jim Garlow and Miles McPherson, American Family Association, Focus on the Family and the National Organization for Marriage. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church, California's largest, also endorsed the measure. The Bishops of the California Catholic Conference, the Grossmont Union High School District in San Diego County, California, the Asian Heritage Coalition.<br>  <br>  No outrage directed toward the large number of blacks and American-Mexicans who voted yes on Prop 8. <br>  <br>  This hatred toward the Church shows a greater hatred than what they are claiming the Church has against them. And, there is no hatred from the Church toward the gay community, in fact many LDS members voted no on Prop 8.<br>  <br>  Edit: the Church did not contribute any funds, some of its members did. And the sites I've seen which post the names of the contributers don't show the religions of these people, so how can you know that they are 'all' LDS?|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Prop 8 was on the California ballot.

Love evolves from the day we are born as - our immediate affection is to our mother, why because with her we feel secure (father, brother, sister, grand-parents become part of this love later ranging from a few days to few months)<br>  <br>  when we are older we become more affectionate with some one else may be our father, brother, sister or just a friend again the reason is the same, we feel more secure as he she understands us more than anybody else.<br>  <br>  We become older and we find somebody special whom we love more than anybody else.<br>  <br>  A child is born to us and the child becomes centre of affection and love to all others become secondary. <br>  <br>  Now the difference, while in our journey of life our centre of love and affection gradually keeps in changing but a believers love to God is consistent.<br>  <br>  To experience the first we need presence of another physical person while to experience the love to God you may still have to reach a level to feel his omnipresence.|`|NaNplX1naa	That is of two different plains. one can not replace the other. but our worldly love must rise to spiritual level.|`|NqfUPKiSaa	Because God is present in the person whom we love<br>  No need to love another person since God is within you|`|xB8051CUaa	there can a lot of debate regarding this....but simply i can say one thing..<br>  <br>  u can love anybody but u cannot worship everybody....that is God d almighty......<br>  love is eternal but attraction is external or u can say it is illusion(mayaa in hinduism) which makes u attract it is common for this body which is external........<br>  <br>  hope u got d diff b/w worship and love|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	these practices are good acquisitions transferable to a loved one later on in life .  yet one should not have to idolize anyone but should respect all .|`|AGEiZzAvaa	The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.

How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 6:3Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 6:4Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.6:5For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 6:6Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 6:7For he that is dead is freed from sin. 6:8Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: 6:9Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 6:10For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 6:11Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 6:12Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 6:13Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. 6:14For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. 6:15What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 6:16Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 6:17But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 6:18Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 6:19I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. 6:20For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 6:21What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 6:22But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 6:23For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Jesus died for the sins of those that truly accept him as their savior.

rV1uAtt3aa	The story of Adam and Eve is metaphorical; it uses magical imagery to convey a religious belief: that God created man as an intelligent creature in His image; and that man, in acquiring knowledge, pays a price in innocence and godliness.  This is the core belief of Christianity and Judaism (possibly Islam; I'm not that familiar with Muslim beliefs.)  The message: accepting God without question brings peace and beauty, but sinful humans are always questioning (aka: free will.)  The Greeks had a similar myth in Pandora's Box.<br>  <br>  Apples, fig leaves, and "sex with Satan" are all just ideas added later.<br>  <br>  As for Kane, the story of Cain and Abel is the story of civilization vs. nature.

God doesn't want you to know what kind of fruit it was or question it, just take it on faith.

49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	There's some truth to it.  "Left-brain" and "right-brain" thinking are a little different because of the different functions of those hemispheres of the brain.  The left side of the body is controlled by the right side of the brain, and vice versa.  In a very broad and general way, the left side of the brain controls analytical processes, whereas the right side of the brain tends to control more creative processes.  People who are left-handed tend to be either right-brain dominant, or have a sort of balance of dominance between the two hemispheres, and tend to be somewhat more creative than someone who's left-brain dominant.<br>  <br>  I'm a person who is ambidextrous; I'm a computer programmer and used to be a math major in college, which are all very "left-brained" activities; however, I'm also a painter, a musician, gardener, and photographer, which are "right-brained" activities.  I'm a member of Mensa, with an IQ of about 140-150 (depends on whose test you look at, and I'm NOT talking about one of those silly online IQ tests!), and I've gone through all the left-brain/right-brain tests, as well as experimental MRI scans to find out WHERE things were going on, so it's a subject with which I have some familiarity.|`|4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	Yes...as the saying goes.....Only left-handed people are in their right mind. The word "sinister" is derived from a Latin or Middle English root "sinistre" which means evil or left-handed which was the prevailing thinking at the time.Right-handedness was called dexter or dextrous.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.singsurf.org/brain/rightbrain.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.singsurf.org/brain/rightbrain...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness</a>|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Psychology 101 tells you this is most likely bullshit.<br>  Most people use both sides of their brain frequently. Some also feel one side is creative and one side is logical, this is more accepted in psychology, but there has also been proof that when some parts are damaged, other parts can adapt and fill in the blanks to compensate. So if you damage your creative half of the brain, your logic half will still be somewhat creative.

a27RHZaAaa	First of all realize one thing- you have a choice whether to think positively or negatively. If you listen to what everyone else says all the time you will only get confused. Now you're convinced that you need advice. Do you know yourself? Who yoou are? If you know yourself well enough you may be able to go ahead with exactly what you want to do.<br>  Stop worrying. You can shape your own destiny by your thoughts and desires. What is the use of saying, "I want to do art school but maybe I won't get a job". You can't start at success with one such negative assumption, <br>  It's OK to have a few cautious thoughts like that but you can't get carried away with them. Do what you love to do and while doing it seek inspiration on how you are going to be successful in it. How well you do is not up to the economy, it's not up to the way anyone else thinks, it's not up to society or the enviroment in any way. It's totally up to you.<br>  If you're so uncertain about your direction and you want time off to think, do something useful, helpful to others or creative in that time. Or take some course that is actually designed to help you with your life direction. Or if you don't have enough money just find how the people without money do that. Like through books or meetings or support groups.<br>  I suggest you just affirm in your mind that you do know what you want to do and you will be succesful. Something like that.<br>  Sounds like you're in a bit of a rut. Maybe travel to a completely different and interesting place.|`|fHA6zk07aa	Take a year off and think about what you are going to think about? Take a year off & take up mental yoga.|`|laGzhW44aa	What I hear is you are having a difficult time finding your comfort zone.  Things were ok before because you all hung tight.  Unfortunately, time has come where those who have been footing the bills are now expecting you to do your share, so all of a sudden a rude awakening of responsibility is placed on your shoulders.<br>  <br>  Everyone who turns 18 becomes scared of the future.  Knowing that makes you rather normal so you're not unique with worries.  What's missing now is your "happy-go-lucky" attitude about life since you are now expected to make something of yourself.<br>  <br>  Take one step at a time.  If you need time off, do it.  If you think going to college and being around your peers, go for it.  Until you have fulfilled this "itch" to react and to act, you will continue to vascillate in uncertainty and I don't think that's what you need right now. <br>  <br>  Whatever direction you take, know that the consequences of your decisions fall on you and you just have to make the best of it just like everyone else.  Part of the consequences is making the most of your situation once you've selected/opted to do what you decide to pursue.  New people, new experiences opens new doors to new horizons and that's always what makes life as Forrest Gump says: You never know what you're gonna get.  Good Luck!

The difference lies in the Bible account of the Flood of Noah's day. If that is true, then Radio Carbon dates are bound to be accurate after the flood, but hopelessly out prior to the flood. Why? Because the Bible says there was a protective canopy covering the earth prior to the Flood. This canopy burst when the Flood came (hence the deluge from above, plus deluges bursting forth from under the ground.) If you take that canopy into account, then you will realize why carbon dating is accurate for all of mankind's recorded human history, but would be absurdly ridiculous prior to the existence of the canopy.<br>  <br>  DNA is interesting in so far as the similarities amongst species is far greater than their differences. All that DNA proves is a common designer who used DNA as a template. It has the scope for variety that would account for every kind of living thing on earth (and when you add in adaptability of species due to circumstances - which is not evolution - the religious people can offer a different reason for the variety we see.) It's not a problem with DNA. It's a problem with the conclusions we jump to based on the DNA. I hope that's rational enough for you!

It is a dogma in the Catholic Canon and all Catholics have to believe in it. <br>  However, Pope John XXIII was very humble and he had a great sense of hum our.

It was conferred upon the Pope when Jesus told Simon Peter "whatsoever you bind upon earth is bound in heaven".  It is the sole means by which the Church of God can know with certainty what is true and what is not.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Find it ironic that those who want to prove the bible wrong, ALWAYS go back to the hardest to understand of the translations, that of the KJV which is in old english.  They rarely if ever use the translations which use modern english.  I don't know if it is because old english SOUNDS holier, so they veil their attacks in words that sound righteous,  OR if they truly think the old english KJV is truly the best translation. OR if they use it because it is easier to confuse people in it. <br>  <br>  In either case,  I generally turn to the NAS or NIV version or the Duoay Rheims version, the latter of which is both easier to understand AND pre-dates the KJ by several decades.  <br>  hehehehehehe<br>  <br>  Here is a pretty good link to some of the contradictions which MAY show up in the Skeptics annotated bible. <br>  <a href="http://members.localnet.com/~the1stkjv/1hit.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.localnet.com/~the1stkjv/1...</a><br>  <br>  Obviously no one here is going to go thru the entire bible and rebuttal each and every entry on the Skeptics Annotated bible,  BUT,  suffice to say,  85% can be refuted merely by reading the entire chapter or at the very least, several verses before and after the passages they quote, in order to establish minimal context in regards to what is being discussed.  Most of the time, upon realizing what is being discussed,  you realize that its NOT as they claim, but a different topic all together.<br>  <br>  just plucking one out of thin air -- #47 "Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there. "<br>  <br>  Actually,  the NIV translate it as jackals and wild dogs, NOT dragons,  I even went to a Jewish site which translates from the Hebrew Tanakh and it ALSO listed Jackals instead of "dragons"  -- so this is simply the skeptics not doing original research and relying on the literal words int he KJV, which as I said is about the WORSE version a non-christian can use, yet they stuborningly stick to it,  which makes me wonder WHY? if their are translational mistakes in the KJV???<br>  <br>  selecting something at random again..<br>  #19 Those who do as God says will never be infertile (neither will their cows!) and will never get sick.<br>  This is NOT what the verse is saying. 1st, this will ONLY take place if the Israelites stay TRUE to God, and they in fact did NOT, the Old Testament is a testament to the Israelites STRUGGLE to follow God, so they were NOT perfect at it.  2nd it CLEARLY says all the diseases that the Israelites see God put upon the Egyptians,  so the verse is merely claiming that the Israelites will not have the 7 plagues put upon them like God did to the Egyptians,  It says it right there.. "and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee." -- So this is CLEARLY a case where the "skeptics" are LOOKING for misinterpretations and taking things TOO literally.<br>  <br>  __________________<br>  <br>  In the end, we can ALL find issues with what anyone says, IF we look for opportunity and take things like a Literalist.<br>  <br>  A "literal" translation doesn't mean we stop at the words on the page. <br>  It means we have to look at WHO was writing,  what is their writing style LIKE?  <br>  Who is the writer writing to, what is his audience? Is his audience EVERYONE, or just the Israelites?<br>  What is the writers "central" message? His MAIN point in all his writings?<br>  How have the customs and attitudes changed over the intervening centuries or millenia?  Were customs and norms different back then? if so, how?<br>  What are the figures of speech back then? How was the language used and what were people use to speaking or hearing language?<br>  Is the writer using a lot of metaphor and similes and other language devices?<br>  What is the original Hebrew or Greek rendering of that passage?<br>  <br>  Lastly,  to get a proper translation, since the bible was not originally written as 1 book by 1 author,  we have to look at it and interpret it in a way which is consistent with ALL the verses.. Not letting 1 verse overwrite another.  2 verses which seem contradictory are in fact NOT, IF we can find a common principle or theme between the 2 of them. Correctly interpreting the bible,  unlike other texts, requires that we not look at things as contradictions but as merely different ways of stating the same concept. -- Like different eye witness accounts on the same event,  they may differ slightly, but so long as we can find a way to make them jive together...then we can include them both.<br>  <br>  ALL these aspects are what TRUE Biblical scholars and theologians have done thru the century in order to interpret the bible. The Catholic church ALSO has the ORAL teachings of the Apostles passed down thru oral tradition and the writings of OTHER 1st century theologians to cross check their interpretation of the New Testament and ensure that their interpretation stays consistent with previous interpretations throughout the centuries. <br>  <br>  We can do the same with the Old Testament, looking back at what OTHER Jewish rabbi's, historians, and theologians have said about the scriptures and how they interpreted it.|`|fX3ydKYAaa	the skeptics endeavor to pick apart the truth until everyone is as skeptical about it as they are.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for prophecy, yes i can refute those sites, any Christian can. there is nothing scary about Christianity. and Jesus is not going to come back and kill all the bad people. good and bad don't have anything to do with it. am i a good person because God was graceful to me? is someone bad because i didn't afford them the same grace? God is holy and the earth is His, sin was NEVER meant to pollute her. God has answered death by death meaning the giver of lifed died on a cross in order to reverse the effects of sin... hence the raising of the dead. Christianity is wonderful and the Lord is glorious and lovely, honorable and full of grace. He must discern between who clings to sin and who clings to Him because He will not endure sin forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  prophecy is how God declared the ending from the beginning. Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and no prophecy makes sense without His hand. prophecy is God's alone and He gives it to men that they may know what He is going to do. prophecy is the future presented here and now. it is mercy for us because God has plans to change everything.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	That's a lot of claims, but I'll make a start and maybe others can pitch in.<br>  <br>  Genesis.<br>  <br>  (Before we get into Genesis, there is dispute as to whether or not it is a parable or actual fact.) <br>  <br>  1. "God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But later Adam eats the forbidden fruit (3:6) and yet lives for another 930 years (5:5). 2:17"<br>  <br>  <br>  If you read the Gospels, Jesus refers to Heaven as "Eternal Life". What would the opposite of eternal life be?<br>  <br>  Eternal Death<br>  <br>  So Hell (opposite of Heaven) would be eternal death.<br>  <br>  God was not referring to death in the physical sense, but to a spiritual death.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped and that others try and clear things up for you :)|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	Sorry, but I don't do links.  Too many viruses around.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	I don't have time to go through all of them right now, so sorry. But the first one, on the first link, i'll try.<br>  <br>  On the day that Adam ate from the tree, he introduced sin and death. It did not matter that he died later, the fact is that he died, and so will all of us. If he had not eaten the fruit, he would not have died.
AA11156135	It appears that God wants to interact with us, -and as he promised, - He has never forsaken Israel. If you look at history, it shows that great nations are just simply gone, -wiped from the face of sigificance. I mean, - where's the aztecs, egyptians and the philistines and a bunch of others. The mere fact that we know a race as "Jews" means that God has kept his promise and they're still relevant today.<br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that charities will claim on the radio that for every $dollar that you donate, - that there will be a matching $dollar by some other donor? Well you being the 2nd donor think that your dollar is being 'doubled', - when in fact the 1st donor is really doubling HIS donation by provoking you to give.<br>  <br>  That's the same way with God, - he creates circumstances where we as believers reciprocate with Him, - and while it appears the we cause God to 'change his mind', - it's actually God changing us.|`|AA11367301	I would say the Bible has not been complete translated correctly and needs another testament written through the inspiration of God get it all right.

YOUR adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour [someone]. <br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 18:9-13) “When you are entered into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not learn to do according to the detestable things of those nations. 10?There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, 11?or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead. 12?For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you. <br>  <br>  (2 Corinthians 11:14-15) And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. 15?It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.

How can you question what some ghost is telling you, when the ghost supposedly is seeing things you can't? <br>  <br>  So I think you're asking to be hoodwinked and probably cheated out of money when you ask advice of a psychic or a ghost.  <br>  <br>  Maybe they're really in contact with the "other world" and maybe not - but how will YOU be able to tell for sure, one way or another?|`|AaKZekyRaa	I think you're wasting your time and money but that's your right.

On the other hand, if you're going mainly for a "ghost hunt" and to consult a psychic, the trip is a massive waste of time and money.<br>  <br>  Consider this: People have believed in supernatural and psychic stuff for 10's of thousands of years, and in all that time there hasn't been ONE confirmed, valid, reproducible event, sighting or demonstration of anything supernatural or any psychic powers. Not ONE. And when I say "not one", I actually mean NOT ONE. None. Zero, zilch, zippo, nada. How is that possible, UNLESS the supernatural and psychic powers are fiction, myth and superstition?<br>  <br>  You seem somewhat intelligent. Think about it.

She is a Christian and had the idea of finding out things about her future--her future husband so she stopped by a psychics place of business.  the lady inside freaked when she saw the girl, she paid no attention so she stepped in, the psychic told her "no miss", yet the girl continued entering, the psychic told her "miss, when you were at the door, there was this big angel behind you but when you entered it left you alone".  so go from here <br>  Peace to you.|`|0xnv5waeaa	bring a gun loaded with salt and find the bones and burn it with salt and gasoline. bring lots of salt in case the ghost is hostel<br>  <br>  psychic are cons they really don't have power if they did so would aliens and chimps <br>  <br>  ghost are not real by the way|`|uK3tkaOJaa	As long as you don't have to lay out any money for it, enjoy and have a laugh.

Christians just like to borrow pagan holidays add Christian meaning and keep the pagan objects along with the Christian ones.  Most likely Jesus was not born on Christmas, and we really don't know the exact date Jesus was crucified otherwise, it wouldn't change every year.  For instance, Jesus died on one particular day but Easter always changes with the Jewish calendar and is never the same particular day. Easter was originally associated with the pagan goddess Oester or Eastre.

AA10945101	Excellent question...personally I can't imagine why anyone would believe in "a god" (any god) "just in case".  Seems like a gigantic waste of time to me, especially if that god (e.g. the biblical God) made it clear that faith is the prerequisite for gaining anything by acknowledging him.  "Just in case" clearly is NOT an expression of faith...hope perhaps but not faith.  "Just in case" clearly reveals that the person doesn't really believe it is true...and if you and I can see this, it is a pretty safe assumption that a god (including the biblical God) could see it too.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	and that is only one reason why pascal's wager is a load of BS.<br>  <br>  Also, which of the thousands of gods that man has created should you believe in?

The way to get eternal life is by believing in Jesus and who he claimed to be.  Good works, such as humility, are a natural effect of a saving faith – but not the cause of it.  On another point, all Christians love Jehovah – but there is only one denomination that creates its own sectarian translation of the Bible to comport with its doctrines – especially the doctrines that are debatable.   For example, in the NW version were see countless times where the term Jehovah is inserted into the text, when that term is not found in the original Greek.   Here’s a related example:<br>  <br>  King James Version:<br>  <br>  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:<br>  <br>  New World Translation:<br>  <br>  Because by means of him all other things have been created....all other things have been created through him....Also, he is before all other things and by means of him all other things were made to exist....<br>  <br>  Why has the Watchtower added the word OTHER four times in the above passage, when this word is not found in the original Greek? By the way, the very first edition of the NWT’s New Testament didn’t even bracket the word “other” to show that it was added to the text and when the Watchtower quotes the above verse in their literature, they remove the brackets.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Angelmus: What are you talking about?  What is the point? <br>  <br>  Luke 11:42 (King James Version) reads:<br>   42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.|`|ad66303e43f746ff778f292b10d3a8fcaa	Great scripture.

A government and king needs subjects to rule.

It is true that objectively we are saved by the death and resurrection of Jesus and by our faith in Jesus Christ. But subjectively our salvation depends on our striving for the same. That is why St. Paul teaches, "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure" (Ph1. 2:12-13). "Brethren, I do not couldn't myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press towards the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (PhI. 3:13-?14). Sanctification is 'already' and 'yet' (1Cor 1 :2).1 came to call the sinners, Jesus said (Lk. 9: 56; Mt. 18: 11) Jesus established is Church to sanctify the sinners. He awaits their conversion and not their destruction. Though the church is holy (Eph. 5: 26-27), till the end of the world there will be sinners, striving for holiness. The parable of the wheat and weeds elucidates this fact (Mt 13:24-30, 36-43). So even those who think they stand, may take head lest they fall (1 Cor. 10: 12). There is a precaution in Peter's words. "If the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear" (1 Pet. 4: 18; Pros 11:31). "For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse than the beginning" (2 Pet 2:20) So we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling. "For, we have become partakers of Christ if we hold our beginning confidence steadfast to the end" (Heb.3:14). Only Jesus is the true way that leads to eternal life (Jn.14:6). Those who have accepted Jesus as Saviour, have to walk with Jesus, as he walks in the way of the Father. "He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as he walked" (1 Jn. 2:6).

The priests alone held the keys to salvation and could threaten the unbelievers with eternal punishment. Hence, in the evolution of Christianity in the last two thousand years with priests preying on human fears, the religion has demonstrated extraordinary powers of survival. Even without the priests, the various versions of the Bible have had more influence on the history of the world, in the minds of men than any other literature.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the beliefs in Scripture produced the most violent actions against man in the history of humanity up to that time. The burning of competing Christian cults (called heretics) by early Christian churches acted as the seeds of violent atrocities against man. There later followed the destruction of Rome by the Christian Goths, and the secret pagan sacrifices consented by the Pope, the Vandals that had the Bible with them as they destroyed imperial North Africa, the crusades in the eleventh century fighting in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Syria, capturing Jerusalem and setting kingdoms from Anatolia to the Egyptian border. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade plundered Constantinople the most holy city at that time, with Christians fighting Christians. And the slaughters continued (and continues to this day). According to Romer, "More heretics and scholars were burned in the Middle Ages than were ever killed in Carolingian times. For at this time the Inquisition came into its own, and torture, largely unused as an instrument of government since Roman days, was reintroduced."<br>  <br>  In the 1380s, John Wycliffe translated the first English Bible which inspired an English religious revolution which caused persecutions against him by the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  In the early 1500's the German heretic, Martin Luther, almost single handedly caused the final split from the Roman Catholic church and created the beginnings of the Protestant revolution. This split still influences violence to this day. He translated the Bible into German which further spread Protestantism. Luther also helped spread anti-Semitism with his preaching and books such as his "The Jews and their lies," all supported through his interpretation of the Bible. One should not forget that Hitler (a Christian and great admirer of Luther) and his holocaust could not have occurred without his influence and the support of Bible believing German Christians.<br>  <br>  In the 1530s William Tyndale completed his version of the English Protestant Bible (probably with the aid of Luther) and the first to print the English Bible. He too felt the persecution of the Church and he spent his last days in imprisonment and exile. His enemies finally caught him and burned him at the stake, but because of his celebrity, they strangled him first (what nice guys!).<br>  <br>  After Luther's German Bible, others followed suit by translating the Bible into their native languages including Dutch and French. Not until 1611 C.E. did a committee of translators and interpreters complete the most popular Bible of all time, the King James Version.<br>  <br>  Today we still have dozens of Bible translation versions, with Bible scholars still arguing over the meaning and proper translations of words and phrases. The following shows just a few of the most popular versions:<br>  <br>  King James Version (KJV) <br>  The New King James Version (NKJV) <br>  Modern King James Version [Green's Translation] (MKJV) <br>  Literal Translation Version [Green] (LITV) <br>  International Standard Version (ISV) <br>  The New International Version (NIV) <br>  English Standard Version (ESV) <br>  New English Bible (NEB) <br>  American Standard Version (ASV) <br>  New American Standard Bible (NASB) <br>  Revised Standard Version (RSV) <br>  New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) Contemporary English Version (CEV) <br>  Today's English Version (TEV) <br>  The Living Bible (LB) <br>  New Century Version (NC)<br>  New Life Version (NLV) <br>  New Living Translation (NLT) <br>  Young's Literal Translation (YLT) <br>  Revised Young's Literal Translation (RYLT) <br>  John Darby's New Translation <br>  Weymouth New Testament Translation <br>  Rotherham's <br>  <br>  (One might wonder what will happen to the "new" revisions a few hundred years from now. Nevertheless, the King James Version still remains the most used Bible in the world today and it will probably continue its popularity long into the future.)<br>  <br>  No doubt that future versions of Bibles will surface in the future: revisions of previously revised Bibles and newer revisions of new versions. The history of the many versions of the Bible stories, from the ancient Mesopotamian myths to the varied interpretations, interpolations, and versions of the Bible speaks volumes about the reliability of their interpretations and the alleged "truth" they claim the Bible holds, because it shows that the Bible comes not from supernatural agents but rather from human imagination. We have not one shred of evidence for the supernatural influence on human written works (and mostly from unknown authors), but we do have an abundance of evidence for human recorded beliefs and myths. This shows a marked difference between those of scientific works and those deriving from religious minds. For example, Euclid's Elements written around 300 B.C.E. has changed little since its inception. Scientists don't argue and debate about its meaning because they know it doesn't represent an absolute or fixed work. It only provides a step in the understanding of geometry. Most Christian apologists, on the other hand, view the Bible as fixed and absolute, if only they could only just get the interpretation correct. But regardless of how much they want the Bible to reflect their particular beliefs, they can never dislodge the violence and atrocities described and condoned by their God in the stories in the Old Testament. Nor can they dismiss the even more horrific result of the horrors of Hell as amplified by the words of the alleged Jesus in the New Testament where almost everyone on earth dies in eternal fire. In short, Bible belief influences horror, not by the majority but by the few that actually believe in its macabre prophecy and have the power to force their beliefs onto the majority. <br>  <br>  We have little reason to think that violence inspired by Bibles and other religious texts will ever cease. One only has to look at the religious wars around the world to see belief's everlasting destructive potential. One only has to look at the Protestant-Catholic uprising in Ireland, the conflicts in the middle east with Jews fighting Moslems & Christians, the Gulf war, Sudan's civil war between Christians and Islamics, the Bosnia conflicts, and the war in Iraq. The desperate acts of fanatical individuals who have killed for their beliefs of Jesus, Mohammed, God or Satan would create a death list unmatched by any other method in history. The "Holy" Bible supports the notion of war and destruction, not only as a prophesy but as a moral necessity. If we wish to become a peaceful species, it may well serve us to understand the forces of belief that keep us in continual conflict and why the Bible has such a stronghold on the minds of people around the world.|`|1iWNBBMfaa	His historical existence is rather probable. It doesn't seem very logical there developed such a hype about nobody. Besides: the gospels seem authentic in the way they describe Israel around the year 0.<br>  The secular accounts of Jesus are very very sparse and written down much later. They had only some information from hearsay.<br>  <br>  Of course his historical existence doesn't proof more than that. Sai Baba is a real man but I don't suppose he is really the divine Shiva as he claims....|`|AA10556726	Well, dating methods show that the gospels were written around 70 years after the time of of Jesus and there is evidence that suggests that they are rewrites of older texts..  Secular accounts range from around 30 years after Jesus would have died to several centuries after.  The earliest secular reference is Josephus, who would have been an infant when Jesus would have been crucified and his references to Jesus are disputed as they do not match his writing style and appear to have been interjected.<br>  <br>  Then there is that there is no confirming external confirmation of the Gospels accounts, no record of the census, no record of the slaughter of 2 and under boys, no record of Jesus' crucifixion, not to mention that no one noticed the star of Bethlehem, the earthquake or 6 hours of darkness (and yes they did record events like these.)<br>  <br>  While you could consider all the references as evidence, it can not be considered as compelling.  About the best that can be said is that it would not be surprising if a notable person named Jesus had existed.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  It should be noted that there is at least one other account of another messiah who was portrayed somewhat similarly as Jesus.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Do you rely on the Book of Mormon as historical evidence that what it says is real?  Do you believe that the Upanishads prove the existence of the Hindu pantheon?<br>  <br>  The secular accounts of Jesus were all written decades later and just report what people believed about him.  There is not one single contemporary mention of such a person.|`|5ydqCVE2aa	The bible is kind of biased because most of it relies on Jesus being real to establish its moral teachings.<br>  <br>  The only other secular account I am aware of is Josephus, which is of doubtful authenticity|`|AA11264399	Because it's not history, it's mythology.

SsSIbFhcaa	You need to look at the verse in context and if needed the original greek for words that you do not understand.<br>  <br>  In context Jesus is describing what will happen to the disciples when Jesus is arrested.<br>  <br>  As far as the word offended goes you have to realize that the King James uses a version of English we no longer use. What a word meant in 1611 is not necessarily what the word means today.<br>  <br>  The Greek word used there is: <br>  <br>  Strong's G4624 - skandalizō <br>  <br>  In context of what is happening the best meaning is: b) to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and obey<br>  <br>  After Jesus was arrested the disciple deserted him when they should not have.<br>  <br>  On the part where it says "for it is written" this is a direct quote from Zechariah 13:7 (NIV)<br>  <br>  "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!" declares the LORD Almighty. "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.<br>  <br>  God is saying that when Jesus (the shepard) is struck down the sheep (disiples) will scatter.<br>  <br>  Its a prophecy and Jesus is reminding them of it.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  While it is possible they could have wandered away never to come back that is not what happened. When Christ arose from the grave he met with all of them except Judas of course. They all went to their deaths proclaiming Jesus risen bodily from the grave.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Always the teacher to the very end, he continued his discourse on the theme of the sacrificial lamb. He told them he would be smitten, and that they would be scattered as sheep without a shepherd (see Matt. 26:31). “But after I am risen again,” he said, “I will go before you into Galilee” (Matt. 26:32).<br>  <br>  Luke and John record this conversation as occurring in the Upper Room where Jesus and his disciples were celebrating the Feast of the Passover; Matthew and Mark put it at the Mount of Olives after the select group had left their paschal celebrations. What matters, however, is that all four gospel authors preserved it so we might: (1) View the weakness of man before he is strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit; (2) Know Jesus' concept of true conversion; (3) Gain a better knowledge of the earlier command to go forth without purse or scrip; and (4) Receive a renewed announcement of the coming death of Jesus.   <br>  <br>  Matt. 26:31. What a dreadful thing it is to call for a sword against God; and yet it is part of the plan. Jesus is to die; the Shepherd is to be slain; the sheep are to be scattered. And Zechariah had foretold it all in these Messianic words: "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones." (Zech. 13:7.)
cdFqekzZaa	I am glad you learned from yesterday. Now go forth and let no one judge you in regards to a sabbath day, or a moon celebration, or the eating of meat offered to idols, but live in the power and freedom of Christ.|`|3DqymlTtaa	This is because of what Jesus did for us on the cross. We are no longer condemned by the law because Christ took ALL our sins upon himself when he was crucified. Therefore we are no longer judged by the law. (Isaiah 53:3-11) The “Oldness of the letter” is referring to the law that was held as the standard in the Old Testament. <br>  <br>  We are now judged by whether or not we accept the free gift of salvation. It is free because Christ already paid the price. The “Newness of spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit that we received when we accept that free gift.  (John 3:4-18)<br>  <br>  However, you should not stop reading at verse 6. Keep reading the whole chapter, because it is made very clear that this is not an excuse to sin. It is simply a reminder that Christ has paid the price and if we have accepted Christ’s free gift then God no longer sees our transgressions against the law. God now sees the Holy Spirit which covers (or hides) our broken laws. <br>  <br>  You can also read Galatians 3:9-14.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful!|`|QUg9W2NGaa	What we are serving in newness of the spirit is the purpose of God. When a kid is raised with just some rules (even if they are good) he/she will eventually feel so tired of them and more likely break one or more of those rules. Once broken, the remorse and the guilt are notorious and punishment makes it even worse.<br>  <br>  Now, if we raise the child with LOVE he/she will think and feel differently towards wrong doing. And if that love has Jesus as foundation then they will live it and enjoy it with their heart (SPIRIT) and not only by reciting the ten commandments. May be this is what Paul was trying to tell us.
H8WqMK1eaa	And what exactly is the "law of God"?|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Of course. I will make a suggestion as well. If you wish to encourage others to come to God willingly, you are going to have to change the way you speak. You sound like the most boring sermon in history in an empty church on a rainy Sunday. Warmth and soft kind words (just as Jesus used) are much more preferable. You will never draw anyone to God in this society with words like that. They will just turn and walk away.|`|AA10266519	I believe that what St. Paul is saying is he realizes the law of God to be right and true so he delights in it. Inwardly he knows this but outwardly he still fights against his own sinful flesh and strives to conquer whats contrary to it. He knows his sanctification (his being made holy) draws it's strength from Christ who fulfilled this law.|`|heDsE26Faa	Once you have decided to live for the Lord, the flesh becomes something you war against daily.  You know the things which are right in the Lord, yet your flesh derives pleasure out of that which is not pleasing to God.<br>  <br>  It becomes a struggle between the desire to please God in your spirit with praise and worship and reading His word, or whatever He leads you into, and the desire to full fill your fleshly pleasures which lead you into sin.<br>  <br>  Example:  You are on the computer for something as innocent as searching for images to use your myspace, and something catches your eye, and you follow that site to another site and before you know it, no longer are you doing something that did not offend God, now you are into porn, pleasing the flesh.

It explains everything we need to know, especially its spiritual importance. Yahweh has painted a magnificent picture, an elaborate detailed picture explaining His path to salvation. A fantastic book to read is "The Owner's Manual" by Ken Power, available free online. Unfortunately most Christians remove the Renewed Covenant from its context and base, which is the Old Covenant, and thereby lose so much information and so many important truths.<br>  <br>  Paul delighted in the Torah because it showed him the Messiah. The Torah also showed him what sin is. The Law is freedom, if one knows how to interpret it. I encourage everyone to read the source link provided, the book I menioned earlier.<br>  <br>  Psalm 119:174 "I long for your salvation (Yahshua - Jesus), O Yahweh, and your law (Torah) is my delight."|`|cdFqekzZaa	But we have a new Law written on our hearts,for the old law brought sin and death.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	Sorry I don't speak "Renissance fair".

On the rare occasions I've been to church there (catholics excepted as the form of catholic worship is laid down by the Vatican and no-one must deviate!) it has felt more like a theatrical performance than actual worship, by comparison with what I know here in the UK.  So yes, there does seem to be a certain level of hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  Or maybe not - Christians say they have the ultimate truth, and one reason the USA is hated in other parts of the world is that it thinks it has got it right and feels it has to throw its weight about to enforce its views elsewhere.  At least that's how muslim terrorists see it and that's why they fight back.
AA11232725	I don't think that you can make a direct connection between " Mormons, JW’s, Adventists, etc" and the historical period that you are talking about.<br>  <br>  Cults have been springing up since the first century and the Bible attributes them to the spirit of the "anti-Christ".<br>  <br>  1 John 4:1  Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  2  By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,  3  and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.<br>  <br>  Mormons and JW's both preach a different Jesus than the Jesus of the Bible. Adventists appear to have been led astray by the false prophet Ellen White. Scientology is the brainchild of a scam artist.|`|9BeUbORtaa	There was certainly a reaction against the English Church after the Revolutionary War (which is why the American Church calls itself Episcopalian and not Anglican), but many of the founding fathers were themselves Anglicans, including James Madison and George Washington (Jefferson and Franklin were originally Episcopalian, but then went off on some strange Romantic Deist Revolutionary tangent).<br>  <br>  But the Anglican Church was not the only religious tradition America inherited from the Old World. From the time of the Puritans in Massachusetts, Non-Conformists found a home in American soil. Arguably, this group was the intellectual and spiritual progenitor of the Southern Baptist movement. But it is to Great Awakening - the evangelical Protestant revival of the mid-18th century - that you really have to look if you want to understand the character of specifically American kinds of Christianity.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	The U.S. government did not force anybody to change their religion.  However, bishops in the Church of England had to swear fealty to the monarch which, obviously, American bishops could not do. There was some thought to having a church without bishops.  However, there were bishops in Scotland who had been ordained before Scotland and England were united, and therefore had not sworn fealty to the English monarch (the technical term was "nonjuring bishops").  The first American bishops were consecrated by Scottish bishops.<br>  <br>  There are divisions in protestantism throughout the world, and particularly in Europe.  It is not a uniquely American phenomenon.

86PFQF4raa	Michael seems to be an important individual in heaven. Archangel means "chief of the angels", so Michael must be the chief of the angels. He is the leader of the angels. (Later on this page, we will find out that Michael is actually the commander of the Lord's army of angels in heaven.) <br>  <br>  The name Michael has an important meaning as well, it means: (one) who is like God. The computer lexicon describes Michael as: one of, the chief, or the first archangel who is described as the one who stands in time of conflict for the children of Israel. In the new Testament, Michael is described as: the first of the chief princes or archangels who is supposed to be the guardian angel of the Israelites.<br>  <br>  Let's look at all the Bible text that mention his name.<br>  <br>  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. <br>  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. Daniel 10:12-13<br>  Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. <br>  But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. Daniel 10: 20-21 <br>  In Daniel we find that Michael is one of the chief princes and that He is our prince. That might mean He is in line for the Throne. We also find Him working behind the scenes with Gabriel to ensure that God's will for nations actually occurs.<br>  <br>  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. <br>  And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. <br>  And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. Daniel 12:1-3 <br>  Now we see Michael who is called the great prince, standing up, and when he does a time of trouble starts and God's people are delivered. Why is it that God's people are delivered when Michael stands up. Why not God or Jesus? And why is Michael described as standing for the children of thy people? <br>  <br>  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. Jude 1:9 <br>  In Jude we see Michael confronting Satan when Moses was resurrected. Many people think of Michael as being just an angel. If this is true then why would an angel be used in such a direct confrontation as to confront Satan? Why shouldn't God or Jesus be doing these important confrontations? (By the way, this can be a difficult text to fully understand. There is more on Jude 1:9 in the middle and also toward the end of this page.)<br>  <br>  And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, <br>  And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. <br>  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. <br>  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. <br>  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <br>  Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:7-12 <br>  Finally in the book of Revelation, we see that there is a war in heaven. The opposing sides are described as Michael and his angels against the dragon which we know as Satan and his angels. The war in heaven is very important. Why isn't God taking part in the war. Why are the angels described as being Michael's angels and not God's or Christ's angels?<br>  <br>  Who is Michael anyway? Michael is the archangel, the chief of the angels. He is described as one of the chief princes and our prince. When He stands up, things happen. He is described as standing for the children of thy people. So when He stands, there is a time of trouble that results in God's people being delivered, every one who's name if found written in the book.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	15?For this is what we tell YOU by Jehovah’s word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep [in death]; because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.<br>  <br>  1 Thessolians 4:15, 16<br>  <br>   But when Mi′chael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body, he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms, but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.” Yet these [men] are speaking abusively of all the things they really do not know; but all the things that they do understand naturally like the unreasoning animals, in these things they go on corrupting themselves.<br>  <br>  Jude 9, 10|`|f6dxZXPGaa	He defeated our worst enemy ( Satan) who is also created by God... lol|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	he defeated satan|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	1 Thessalonians 4:16 (NIV)<br>  16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. <br>  Daniel 10:13 (NIV)<br>  13 But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days.

(No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince.|`|P5rczL0Saa	He's not Jesus! Nor was Jesus ever Michael. <br>  Michael is an archangel. He tossed satan out of heaven, and he is the protector of Israel. I think he is probably pretty intimidating.|`|xabf4UbJaa	defeated satan in a battle|`|X9rXRNUxaa	MICHAEL <br>  <br>  Would you like to know what the Bible has to say about the "Great Prince" (Michael), Who is this formidable but friendly person? <br>   Daniel 10:13 calls him "one of the chief princes"; but according to what the Bible says elsewhere, this identification is an understatement. <br>   Jude 9 calls Michael "the Archangel" and expression that means "the chief angel". Michael is "the" archangel, the chief angel. Folk stories have created several "archangels" but in the Bible there is only one, the Archangel Michael. <br>   Michael, a holy being. In the Hebrew language the name Michael is a question: "Who is like God?" According to Revelation 12:7, in the celestial, invisible warfare that began long ago to be waged between right and wrong, Michael commanded the angels of God in driving out the angels of Satan out of heaven. <br>   Joshua met this same commander of the angels prior to the battle of Jericho and learned that He is a very Holy Person. Seeking help through prayer previous to his assault on Jericho, Joshua suddenly observed a soldier standing in front of him, sword in hand. "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?" he challenged. And the soldier replied, "As commander of the army of the Lord I have now come...Put off your shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy." (Joshua 5:13-15) <br>   You already know that Moses was once told to take off his shoes because the ground he occupied was holy. Moses was standing by a burning bush that was not consumed. A voice from within the fire commanded him,"Put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground." <br>   Michael, the LORD (Yahweh or Jehovah).In the conversation that followed at the bush, the Person in the flames identified Himself to Moses as "the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Exodus 3:6. He also identified Himself as "I AM WHO I AM" - that is, as the Lord, Yahweh, or Jehovah. Exodus 3:14,16. But Exodus 3:2, in introducing the account of this great event, states that it was "an angel of the Lord" who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. <br>   Can an angel be God? Can God be an angel? <br>   What is an angel? The word "angel" literally means "messenger." The spies whom Joshua sent to examine Jericho in preparation for his attack are called "messengers" in English but "angels" in Greek. James 2:25. <br>   The supreme Messenger, the supreme Person sent to earth with a message, is Jesus Christ. In His prayer on the way to the cross (John 17), He referred to Himself as "Jesus Christ whom thou (God) hast sent." v.3. In the same prayer He referred to Himself and the Father as being "one". v.11. In the Godhead, Jesus, God's Son, is as truly divine as God the Father is. Both are eternal and bear the "family" name, Yahweh, Jehovah, I AM. But Jesus is the messenger, the very special "Angel," sent out by the Father. <br>   At the second coming the "voice of the archangel" signals the resurrection of the dead, according to 1 Thessalonians 4:16. And according to John 5:28,29, it is the "voice of the Son of God" that raises the dead. Daniel 12:1-4 says that when Michael arises at the end time, "many of those who sleep in the dust shall awake." <br>   Michael, the archangel whose voice will raise the dead, is Jesus the Son of God, our Saviour. And being both God and an Angel (in a very special sense), He is inevitably, ex officio, the chief of the angels - the Archangel. <br>   Michael, the Glorified Christ. Now, if the Lord Jesus is Michael, then the magnificent Being whose brightness almost overpowered Daniel at the opening of the vision of Daniel 10 was also Michael. <br>   The fact of His being Michael is obscured in the R.S.V. by a regrettable rendering of Daniel 10:13, which seems to say that in order for Gabriel to make his visit to Daniel, he had to leave Michael for a while to continue the fight with the prince of Persia. The implication in the R.S.V. is that gabriel came by himself to see Daniel. A further implication is that the bright Being in the vision was not Michael but Gabriel. <br>   The Interpreter's Bible rightly points out that the simplest translation of the Hebrew is "seeing that I was left there," meaning that the verse says nothing at all about Gabriel's leaving Michael alone but instead the Gabriel had been working alone until Michael came to help him. Happily, a number of versions do translate the verse this way. N.A.S.B. has "For I (Gabriel) had been left there with the kings of Persia", the N.I.V has "Because I was detained there with the king of Persia", and "Because I had been left alone in Persia" reads Today's English Version. <br>   And what is the value of knowing that Michael is not a created being but is, in fact, our divine Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ? <br>   For one thing, this knowledge helps us to keep the vision of Daniel 10-12 in proper perspective. This vision begins with the revelation of Jesus in His glory. It ends with a revelation about Jesus at the second coming. The|`|wuPTBIIuaa	dont you mean to say what does the interpretation of various religions say about the bible talking about michael?<br>  <br>  it one place it shows Micheal with a sword in hand. ready to destroy the enemies of Israel. <br>  <br>  specifically thats all i know and remember at this time<br>  <br>  however, some people say michael is Jesus and jesus was once michael. <br>  the LDS church specifically says Adam is the ancient of days and other say father adam is Micheal.

AA11622701	Thing of it this way.  If you have two parents with blond hair, odds are they will pass on to the their the genes for blond hair, and the child will be born a blond.  They inherit their parent's traits.  If you did not want to have a child with blond hair, then you would not want to have a blond for the father.<br>  <br>  When Adam sinned, his spirit was changed so that it desired sin.  He passes that trait on to all his children, just like he passes on his hair color and other physical traits.  If God wanted to have a child who did not have Adam's fallen nature, then he had to have a father who was not fallen.  Since there is no human who not fallen, it had to be God himself who fathered jesus.<br>  <br>  "Sex" is not original sex, any more than "sex" is blond hair.

LOL!!<br>  <br>  Jesus had to have been born of a virgin, supposedly, to even be considered a god because there were so many others with the exact same story.<br>  <br>  In addition to a lack of historical support, many characteristics of Jesus, which Christians today believe in, are undeniably similar or identical to religious trends and beliefs that preceded Christianity. There are tens of accounts of pagan gods of many different cultures who were said to have the same attributes as those that Christians claim Jesus had. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Trinity―Trinities were popular in pagan sects before Christianity was introduced to the world. Some of the more well known trinity gods included Mithra-Vohu Mana-Rashnu, Amen-Mut-Khonsu, and Osiris-Isis-Horus.<br>  <br>  Virgin Birth―Among the pagan cultures that preceded Christianity, virgin birth stories abounded. The long list of pagan gods born of virgins includes: Romulus and Remus, Zoroaster, Buddha, Mithras, Chrishna, Osiris-Aion, Agdistis, Attis, Tammuz, Adonis, Korybas, Perseus, and Dionysus.<br>  <br>  Disciples―In the following 'saviors' cases, a grouping of disciples was present, just as they were present in Jesus' story: Horus, Buddha, Chrishna, Dionysus, Mithra. Interestingly enough, in the case of Dionysus, his disciple Acoetes was a boatman, just as Jesus' disciple Peter. And just as Peter was freed from jail when the doors miraculously flew open, so was Dionysus' disciple Acoetes. In Budda's case, he, like Jesus, demanded that his disciples renounce all worldly possessions. Yet another instance of similarity is that the disciples of both Jesus and Buddha were said to have been arrested for preaching, as well as witnessed to have "walked on water."<br>  <br>  Miracles―Among those 'saviors' who, like Jesus, performed countless miracles include: Horus, Chrishna, Buddha, Dionysus, Mithra, Osirus, and Adonis. Horus was said to have walked on water, just as Jesus did. In addition, Horus raised one man, El-Azarus, from the dead in front of countless witnesses. In the case of Buddha, it was told that he fed five hundred men with one loaf of bread, that he cured lepers, and that he caused the blind to see.  Dionysus  rescued a person from dying when the person was utterly desolate and placed them among the stars. And he gave food and drink, herbs and berries, to the starving people -- not to mention turning water into wine.<br>  <br>  The Sun―Here is another common theory, quoted from S. Acharya's "The Origins of Christianity and the Quest for the Historical Jesus:" "The reason why all these pagan narratives are so similar to a "god-man" is that these stories were based on the movements of the sun through the heavens, an astrotheological development that can be found throughout the planet because the sun and the 12 zodiac signs can be observed around the globe.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Paul was supposedly born and raised in the city of Tarsus, a region in SE Asia-Minor (now called Turkey) where Mithras was well known.  Biblical scholars are now saying that Paul, the alleged author of 13 out of the 27 (maybe more) books of the New Testament, may have been influenced in his writings by this strong religion of Mithraism.  We can see a profound kinship between Mithraism and Christianity.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Would never happen, again."<br>  <br>  "Any such attempts, would always<br>   result with having a girl born, only<br>   by the 'C-section' procedure."|`|4VouLn4waa	First off, original sin is never mentioned in the bible.

YnGIccE8aa	WHY are you so obsessed with this? Are you an infertile Catholic? Are you Nadya Suleman? What do you want? The Pope didn't condemn it, a larger group of bishops and cardinals discussed it in depth and advised him before the Pope made the decision. Learn more about the faith and how these things are declared before you automatically blame the Pope.<br>  <br>  HERE, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:<br>  2376 Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques (heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the child's right to be born of a father and mother known to him and bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses' "right to become a father and a mother only through each other." <br>  <br>  2377 Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children." "Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses' union . . . . Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person." <br>  <br>  2378 A child is not something owed to one, but is a gift. The "supreme gift of marriage" is a human person. A child may not be considered a piece of property, an idea to which an alleged "right to a child" would lead. In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right "to be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents," and "the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his conception."<br>  <br>  Have you considered adoption?|`|2ujAxFimaa	The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, which "is on the side of life" teaches that "each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseperable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive and procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act." 2366 <br>  <br>  The Church is operating under certain tenets. First, sex is for the married only. It was established by God and has two aspects, unitive and procreative. Second, that every sex act must be open to the transmission of life. It would seem only logical, then, that the Church, which is on the side of life, should embrace methods such as IVF and artificial insemination. It does not, and a closer look at the mentioned tenets will explain why. Sex is to be unitive and procreative. Things like contraception, which is also opposed by the Church, interfere with the procreative aspect of sexual union. IVF and artificial insemination interfere with the unitive aspect. In either case, God is removed from the equation. This is the reason for the Church's opposition to IVF and artificial insemination.|`|AA10920670	With invitro you are fertilizing a number of eggs.

Normally when invitro fertilization is done, several eggs are fertilized.  The Catholic church believes that life begans for each of those eggs.<br>  <br>  Usually only some of the eggs are used, and the rest discarded.  That is seen as "murder".  It is the killing of each of those lives.<br>  <br>  Even when they are inserted, the success rate of those fertilized eggs is small.  The majority do not manage to implant and survive.  Again, the Catholic church sees each of those failed implants (since they are conceived life) as a death.  They see it as creating a life, and then experimented to see if they can keep it alive.  They consider that a sin.<br>  <br>  As for the idea that conceiving a child the normal way with a marriage is somehow "wrong" or "lust" is not supported by the Bible.  God's first commandment to man and woman was to be fruitful and multiple.  The first thing he told Adam and Eve to do was to have sex.  The Bible includes one entire book that is a erotic poem about the joy and beauty of sex within marriage.  In 1 Peter, Christians couples are commanded to have sex regularly, and not to refuse each other.  Paul in 1 Corinthians says that the husband is allowed to enjoys his wife's body, and the wife is to enjoys the husbands.<br>  <br>  Nothing in scripture even hints that anything you can do with your wife is adultery.

The Bible says no such thing about committing adultery with a man's own wife if he is too "carnal". In marriage, a man and a woman are free to do whatever they please intimately, with the exception of anal sex. The Bible DOES say that a man or a woman is not allowed to withhold sex from each other for any reason, other than to part awhile to pray. But then they must get together again right away, lest they be tempted to commit adultery.<br>  <br>  God doesn't care about what the Pope thinks about invitro-fertilization, either. Or about anything to do with the Pope (read James 1:27). We are not allowed to worship or pray to anyone but God. The Pope is only a human being.

Vestigial organs are common in whales for example.[7]. Also, there is evidence that a complex feature with one function can adapt to a wholly different function through evolution in a process known as exaptation. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, and/or mating display. Nowadays, wings may still have all of these functions, while also being used for active flight.<br>  <br>  Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of remains, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be represented in discoveries. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be "caught in the act" as it were. Creationists often argue against this, claiming it is merely a convenient way to explain the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species. However, progress in research and new discoveries continue to fill in such gaps, and in modern thinking evolution is pictured as a bush of lines of development, not the simplistic ladder of progress that was common before Darwin published his theory and still influences popular opinion.<br>  <br>  The theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and first presented in 1972[8] is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory, however, pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period of time. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between extended periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The Swoose:  half swan half goose.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	Most Christians have no objection to evolution BTW.<br>  <br>  I am working on crossing a chicken with a centipede.

XN0cYCATaa	Jesus is God in human flesh. He is not half God and half man. He is fully divine and fully man. That is, Jesus has two distinct natures: divine and human. Jesus is the Word who was God and was with God and was made flesh, (John 1:1,14). This means that in the single person of Jesus is both a human and divine nature. The divine nature was not changed. It was not altered. He is not merely a man who "had God within Him" nor is he a man who "manifested the God principle." He is God, second person of the Trinity. "The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word," (Heb. 1:3, NIV). Jesus' two natures are not "mixed together," nor are they combined into a new God-man nature. They are separate yet act as a unit in the one person of Jesus. This is called the Hypostatic Union.<br>  <br>  The following chart should help you see the two natures of Jesus "in action":<br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/christianity/christian-doctrine/jesus-two-natures-god-and-man" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/christianity/christi...</a>|`|HMteUyRdaa	Yes, the Word was with God in the beginning, because the Word was God, and He became man through the power of the Holy Spirit to be born of the Virgin Mary and dwell among us. This is biblical.<br>  <br>  Pray the Rosary<br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Jesus is “true God and true man” — “of one substance,” “consubstantial” with the Father and at the same time, truly our brother. This central truth of our faith was authoritatively summarized and taught by the Council of Chalcedon in A.D. 451. It proclaimed that Jesus is a divine Person, the second Person of the Holy Trinity, with two natures, divine and human. This does not mean that Jesus is “half God” and “half man,” but rather fully God and fully man. As man he revealed the Father to us and, at the same time, revealed us to ourselves — who we are and what we should become (see Gaudium et Spes, 22). As God, he made us partakers in the divine nature, in the life and love he shared with his Father from all eternity. <br>  <br>  Jesus’ two natures, without becoming confused, work together. The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: “In the humanity of Jesus all things — his miracles, his suffering and his death — must be attributed to his divine Person which acts by means of his assumed human nature” (Compendium, 89). That is why, when Jesus speaks and acts in the Gospels, a wisdom, power and love emerge which baffles his followers and his enemies alike. <br>  <br>  The Incarnation was real. The Son of God truly did assume “a body animated by a rational human soul” (90). As the Second Vatican Council teaches, “He worked with human hands and thought with a human mind” (Gaudium et Spes, 22). In doing so, Jesus learned many things the way we do: by experience. But as God he knew the Father “intimately and immediately.” Jesus was aware of the plan of God the Father, which he had come to fulfill. He also knew the inmost thoughts of others. <br>  <br>  Moreover, Jesus possessed both a human will and a divine will. We all know how easy it is for our will to go awry, to know what we should do but to do something else instead. As we struggle with our fallen nature, here is a beautiful truth for us to reflect on: As the Son of God made man, Jesus willed in a human way all that the Trinity had decided on to bring about our salvation. The human will of Christ was fully conformed to the Father’s saving love. In his will we find the pattern for the obedience that should be ours as baptized sons and daughters of the Father. What is more, we have access to Christ’s obedient love through the Mass and sacraments. Jesus’ obedience serves to heal our disobedience and its effects. <br>  <br>  And not only did Jesus humanly know and follow what he learned from his heavenly Father; with his human heart, he also knows and loves us. For that reason, the Sacred Heart of Jesus symbolizes the boundless love of the Trinity for us. Perhaps this is a good place to end. But it is also the beginning — the inexhaustible foundation of our life in Christ.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes!

Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You up to me; what have You done?"<br>  Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.  If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm."<br>  Pilate therefore said to Him, "So You are a king?"  Jesus answered, "You say correctly that I am a king:  For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."

"I (God) wil be your God, and you will be My people."|`|LJlaHLQdaa	The New Covenant Promise <br>       This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Heb. 10:16, 17. <br>  <br>   It is the Creator of men, the Giver of the law, who declares that it is not His purpose to set aside its precepts. Everything in nature, from the mote in the sunbeam to the worlds on high, is under law. And upon obedience to these laws the order and harmony of the natural world depend. So there are great principles of righteousness to control the life of all intelligent beings, and upon conformity to these principles the well-being of the universe depends.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	This covenant has never been established with the house of Israel, nor with the house of Judah, for it requires two parties to make a covenant, and those two parties must be agreed, or no covenant can be made. <br>  <br>  Christ, in the days of his flesh, proposed to make a covenant with them, but they rejected him and his proposals, and in consequence thereof, they were broken off, and no covenant was made with them at that time. But their unbelief has not rendered the promise of God of none effect: no, for there was another day limited in David, which was the day of his power; and then his people, Israel, should be a willing people; and he would write his law in their hearts, and print it in their thoughts; their sins and their iniquities he would remember no more.<br>  <br>  Thus after this chosen family had rejected Christ and his proposals, the heralds of salvation said to them, 'Lo we turn unto the Gentiles;' and the Gentiles received the covenant, and were grafted in from whence the chosen family were broken off: but the Gentiles have not continued in the goodness of God, but have departed from the faith that was once delivered to the Saints, and have broken the covenant in which their fathers were established (see Isaiah 24:5); and have become high-minded, and have not feared; therefore, but few of them will be gathered with the chosen family.<br>  <br>  To recap in scripture: As the great High Priest, Jesus offered himself as the eternal atoning sacrifice and became the mediator of this new and better covenant (Heb. 8:6), putting the law of God into the hearts of his people (Heb. 8:10; 10:16). The old law (of Moses), with its performances and sacrifices, had been fulfilled. Through the new covenant, God promised to remember the sins of the repentant no more (Heb. 10:17), and each Saint was challenged to enter into "a new and living way" through the blood of Christ (Heb. 10:15-20). Those who were willing to do so in patience and faith would be justified and receive the promise (Heb. 10:35-38).|`|bXeHr69Vaa	the final covenant, the 6th. was jesus at the last supper with his followers. matt. 26 '28|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	Kill all the TV evangelists?|`|AA11232725	Jeremiah 31:33  But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.  34  No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD.

bXHcZ2yEaa	Yes! Listen, not only does St. Paul prove it, but also Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, over 40 of the prophets who never saw each other but lived throughout several centuries all proving the same God. Now what tops it all off is the message and morals they bring, all the love, compassion, morality way ahead of its time, etc...<br>  <br>  Now it is the atheists who are not humble enough to accept this fact. They claim that each and every one of them are all liars, now how foolish is that? And yes, you are right; it is all the proof we need, just like it is mentioned in the story of Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham.<br>  <br>  Why do we sometimes doubt God?

After that, he was seen of above five hundred Brethren at once; <br>  of whom the greater part remain unto this present, <br>  but some are fallen asleep.<br>  <br>  HOW COULD JESUS BE SEEN by FIVE HUNDRED BELIEVERS at once, and WE NOT KNOW who they were? These would be on fire to get The Gospel message of Jesus out. STEPHEN had to be one of them. Paul dedicated his life to the end of getting them ALL killed!<br>  <br>  Once he had succeeded, he now comes to us with a cock-and-bull story about having SEEN JESUS HIMSELF- which is TOTALLY CONTRARY TO JESUS OWN CONDITIONS for manifesting to people.<br>  <br>  JOHN 14:21-27.<br>  <br>  21. "He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, <br>  he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me <br>  shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,<br>  and will manifest myself to him."<br>  22. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, <br>  "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, <br>  and not unto the World?"<br>  23. Jesus answered and said unto him, <br>  "If a man love me, he will keep my words: <br>  and my Father will love him, <br>  and we will come unto him, <br>  and make our abode with him.<br>  24. "He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: <br>  and the word which ye hear is not mine, <br>  but the Father's which sent me.<br>  25.

"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:<br>  not as the World giveth, give I unto you. <br>  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<br>  <br>  THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT in ANY Christian's mind, IF THEY LOVED JESUS, and they would NEVER be troubled, ONCE, to conclude that PAUL'S MINISTRY IS A FAKE!<br>  <br>  HE CONCLUDED HIS MISSION by travelling to Rome to provoke the ONE man with THE GREATEST RESOURCES to persecute ALL CHRISTIANITY, by telling him: "If you kill enough Christians, Jesus will manifest himself to you!" Presenting HIMSELF as the first to be executed. This is why FESTUS called Paul "MAD" (Acts 26:24). he could not understand Paul's motive in demanding to tell his story to CAESAR, because, like all the shallow-minded, ignorant Christians for the past twenty centuries, HE JUST ASSUMED that Paul MUST be a CHRISTIAN, who would want THE BEST for his Brethren. <br>  <br>  The LAST thing a RESPONSIBLE Christian would want is for an EMPEROR to think he could derive some benefit from murdering Christians. At the SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL, all Christians KNOW that Paul's teachings HAVE NO FOUNDATION.

Doubt comes from the old english word "double" If you were to look at someone who had one leg that was longer than the other, as they were walking they shift back and forth, on each foot, moving up and down - that is doubt. Sometimes, we believe something God has shown us and then circumstances in the natural may come that challenge that truth and we may find ourselves starting to lean on the other foot. Swaying back and forth. But as we continue to walk with God and meditate in His word, and listen to His voice, we begin to grow and our legs become even and the doubt becomes faith. Doubt can be the growing pains of faith. And God brings us to the place where no doubt is left and NOTHING can draw us back into the shade of doubt. (Faith sees in the light. Doubt is moving into the shade. Unbelief is turning your back on the light and living in the darkness)<br>   <br>  God speaks or opens up our eyes to see the truth of something in His Word and we believe. We grasp onto that truth. And then the sun comes out and we begin to wonder if "it was all just a dream" At that point we need to hold onto that seed lest the birds (satan & his flock) come and take away the truth of what God has showed us. As we do, the sun (trials/circumstances) assist the growth of that truth and it's transformed from just the size of a seed into a full fruit bearing plant in our lives. It grows from just a truth in our heads that we agree with to an actual part of us. Without the sun / trials, it'd never get there. Trials and circumstances that seem to be totally opposed to the truth of God's word are actually what galvanizes them in us and makes them a reality in our lives and hearts. <br>  <br>  Paul was a faithful witness who would not lie. He loved God so much, it would wound him deeply to do so, especially about the gospel.<br>   <br>  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word (spoken word/rhema) of God. God spoke His word(s) through Paul and others back then and today and everyday in-between.|`|wljJg1UOaa	I WILL SEND $1,000 TO ANYONE WHO CAN SHOW FROM THE BIBLE THAT PAUL EVER SAID THAT HE WENT TO HEAVEN!<br>  <br>     2nd CORINTHIANS 12:2-11.<br>  <br>  2. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, <br>  (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, <br>  I cannot tell: God knoweth;) <br>  such an one caught up to the Third Heaven.<br>  3. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, <br>  I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<br>  4. How that he was caught up into Paradise, <br>  and heard unspeakable words, <br>  which it is not Lawful for a man to utter.<br>  5. Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, <br>  but in mine infirmities.<br>  6. For though I would desire to glory, <br>  I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: <br>  but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me <br>  above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.<br>  7. And lest I should be exalted above measure <br>  through the abundance of the revelations, <br>  there was given to me a Thorn in the Flesh, <br>  The Messenger of Satan to buffet me, <br>  lest I should be exalted above measure.<br>  8. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, <br>  that it might depart from me.<br>  9. And he said unto me, <br>  "My grace is sufficient for thee: <br>  for my strength is made perfect in weakness." <br>  Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, <br>  that the Power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>  10. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, <br>  in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, <br>  in distresses for Christ's sake: <br>  for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br>  11. I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: <br>  for I ought to have been commended of you: <br>  for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, <br>  though I be nothing.<br>  <br>  PAUL WAS A LIAR, out to destroy Christianity From The Beginning.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 24:35.<br>  <br>  35. "Heaven and Earth shall pass away, <br>  but my Words shall not pass away."<br>  <br>  WE CAN END the ride to Fantasy Island RIGHT NOW- or else this can get REAL ugly, REAL fast? (Got your CUP on?)<br>  <br>  WERE THE TEACHINGS OF PAUL THE WORDS OF JESUS- YES, OR NO?<br>  <br>     GALATIANS 1:11-12.<br>  <br>  11. But I certify you, Brethren, <br>  that the Gospel which was preached of me <br>  is not after Man.<br>  12. For I neither received it of Man, <br>  neither was I taught it, <br>  but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  THIS MEANS THAT what Paul taught was NOT what Jesus sent his Disciples to preach! For instance:<br>  <br>        MATTHEW 7:6.<br>  <br>  6. "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, <br>  neither cast ye your pearls before swine, <br>  lest they trample them under their feet, <br>  and turn again and rend you."<br>  <br>  DOES THAT APPEAR ANYWHERE in Paul's teachings?<br>  WHAT he was doing was EXACTLY what Jesus Commanded us to prevent- an Enemy getting hold of the "Source Code" of The gospel, so that he could destroy it by supplanting it with a corrupted counterfeit.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 23:23:27-33.<br>  <br>  27. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! <br>  for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, <br>  which indeed appear beautiful outward, <br>  but are within full of dead men's bones, <br>  and of all uncleanness.<br>  28. "Even so ye also outwardly appear Righteous unto men, <br>  but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.<br>  29.

I believe Paul was a Pharisee undercover infiltrator assigned to take out Christianity from within. This mission was so crucial, it could never be committed to writing. Even the Sadducee Council members could not be told. Therefore, when they were about to kill him out of hand, the Pharisees disrupted the proceedings:<br>  <br>     ACTS 23:6.<br>  <br>  6. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, <br>  and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, <br>  "Men and Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: <br>  of the Hope and Resurrection of the Dead I am called in question."<br>  <br>  PLEASE REMEMBER, that the Pharisees ALREADY LIED about NOT KNOWING who Paul was- their "James Bond 007."<br>  <br>     ACTS 22:3-5.<br>  <br>  3.

TneDU9R3aa	Circumcision in men involves the cutting off of the foreskin protecting the head (or glans) of the penis. As the only moving part of the penis, the foreskin facilitates sexual activity. It contains nerve endings that play a part in sexual pleasure and its glands produce lubricants that help protect both the head of the penis and the female vagina.<br>  <br>  In Judaism; sexual activity is meant for procreation purposes, because coveting sex for pleasure is part of the sin of lust...So to cut off the foreskin is a commitment not to allow lust to be a part of your motivations. It is the main arm of the covenant with God that Jews must accept to be considered a Jew.<br>  <br>  There are several problems with this argument. Firstly: Jew's are circumcised at 8 days old, which is too young to make an informed judgment. Jew's argue that they follow Elijah's way's because it is a commandment from God. However: It is my belief that God promotes the use of free will, and that a child of 8 days is not mentally mature enough to make such a choice.<br>  <br>  Secondly: Not having a foreskin may reduce the facilitation of sexual stimulation. However: If you take away temptation, no effort by the individual is required to learn self control. It could be that if there was an operation to get rid of sex hormones altogether, some people may take it to get closer to God and further from their animal nature. We are here on earth to learn control over the animal nature; so we maybe learn to free ourselves of coveting. Without temptation; suffering; and overcoming, there is no value in having a material life.<br>  <br>  I am suggesting that a covenant with God must be won by developing mental self control; not by cutting out the source of sensual stimulation.<br>  <br>  Fourthly circumcision doesn't stop sexual stimulation. Many men are circumcised, and they still choose hedonism as a lifestyle. Following a law blindly is not the same as following principles and values by applying them to all situations. <br>  <br>  I would argue that to be a true Jew; physical circumcision is not sufficient to enter covenant with God, and is indeed useless. Mental circumcision is what is required.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	Oh, really?<br>  <br>  Many Americans have their male children circumcised before leaving the hospital (as a cleanliness issue).  <br>  <br>  I'll also bet you dollars to doughnuts that most Christian males masturbate.  <br>  <br>  Lots and lots of Christians have pierced ears, and lots and lots of Christians have tattoos.<br>  <br>  (I'm Christian and I'm planning on getting a tattoo for my 55th birthday:  since I'm a meteorologist who studies severe weather, I plan to have the symbol for a severe thunderstorm with heavy rain, hail and a tornado tattooed on my upper arm.)|`|VSCYTZ38aa	My body is my temple and I have the right to decorate it any damn way I want!<br>  <br>  Edit: BTW, I do believe most little boys are circumcised before the leave the hospital these days, not matter what religion they are.

zyw4i3kRaa	Yes I think you're right<br>  The Beginning is the End is the Beginning<br>  <br>  Still 'How I learned to Stop Worrying & Love the Bomb' seems to be the mindset of a lot of people lately (especially Fundamentalists). Instead of being the change they want, they join in on the destruction in a un/conscious attempt to end their own pain & disappointment with life which they project on to the world & further dismiss it as as disgusting (which isn't to say it isn't). There was even someone on Regan's cabinet, high up in power as I recall, who expressed the same sentiment, scoffing at the environment because it was all coming to an end soon anyhow & the big JC was in-bound. It goes along with the fear obsession, we aren't imagining a change for the better on its way, were in the gutter dreaming up WW 3 & disaster flicks, Jesus returning on a cloud or World Government to make it all better, the easy way out with saviors & the whole deal thus rendering ourselves powerless. It doesn't seem to occur to a lot that the outside is just a reflection of what were feeling inside, but that's understandable because were raised from birth to always look outside first instead of vice versa! <br>  *sigh*<br>  This is how people who shouldn't be in power captivate masses I'm sure; Remember Germany was a wreck in search of Big Daddy not so long ago.|`|neWE9LYcaa	Even if the world went on forever who's to say you won't die tonight or tomorrow with meningitis or a heart attack?|`|iHDYncuXaa	The bible is very clear that we are in the end times.

dmCAiuMGaa	Well proponents of same-sex marriage always say "as long as they are consenting adults".|`|3GAiVmEAaa	No. Those are different issues. Incest is harmful, there is a good chance of brith defects and I don't see how someone could do it if there weren't issues. Polygamy has its own issues, I am not completely against it but it isn't the same as homosexual relationships.<br>  <br>  How is a homosexual couple different from a heterosexual couple that cannot conceive?|`|C1SOqQSkaa	As far as I'm concerned, any suitably-contraceived couple or group can shag each other senseless if they're all consenting adults, and don't do it in the street and frighten the horses.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I don't think many people are saying all churches must alter their practices or beliefs to accept homosexuality. Churches should never be forced to perform ceremonies that contradict their beliefs. The issue is that they don't have the right to prevent others from doing so outside their churches in civil ceremonies and in the churches or religions that do accept same sex marriage.<br>  <br>  Incest and polygamy are different in that they often involve minors and thus are non consensual. Although I don't find polygamy anything I'd want to be involved in personally, if its consenting adults who have had the chance to think through and choose such a relationship then I can't see arresting them for it or it being against the law. I am concerned though about the many potentials for abuse. I don't think raising a girl to the age 16-18 in isolation from regular society and then arranging her marriage is exactly consensual. I can't see legislating against what is private activity between consenting adults that doesn't infringe on others rights. Marriage between closely related adults is something there is grounds to have laws against depending on the genetic consequences to offspring. Marriage between first cousins was considered entirely normal by religious people though just a few generations ago while most today think its a bit off and many places have laws against it now.|`|OiAl6w48aa	Homosexuality does not fall into the category of sexual deviance anymore.  That idea went out a number of years ago.  Likewise, polygamy does not fall under sexual deviance - it can be a choice between consenting adults.  As far as incest, that is sexual deviance due to the high likelihood of genetic deformities or other issues resulting from combining genetic material that is already similar.<br>  <br>  Edit: thanks, but I may have learned a thing or two about this in college on the way to my degree.  YOU are the one claiming its deviant behavior, so YOU provide the source to support your claim.  Not the other way around.<br>  <br>  P.S. - I would remind you that you stated this is true "scientifically speaking", not statistically speaking.

sjMIFH9Faa	You ask a great question, and peoples answers really drive me crazy. <br>  <br>  Christianity did adopt pagan ideas, but the extent of that is often exaggerated. <br>  <br>  Look at other people answers. The burining of insence. Sure, both pagans and Christians do it, but they did that too in China and India. Did the Chinese get this idea from European paganism? Probably not, it seems logical enough for people to independantly get the idea of burning good smelling things at religious events. They do it all over the world.<br>  <br>  Other people put Christmas and Easter as being the pagan celebration for changing of the seasons. The Aztec also celebrated the changing of the seasons, did they get the idea from Greco-Roman pagans. Absolutly not. <br>  <br>  My point is that some ideas are broad enough that they could have been thought up independently. <br>  <br>  But the Christians did adopt many other pagan ideas. The best example of this would be Greek logic and Roman architecture. John the evangelist makes it pretty clear that he read Plato. The Word made fleash for example is very Platonic, and not something he would come up with on his own. The Christian concept of hell isn't from the Hebrews, it is actually more similer to Zoroastrianism from Persia. <br>  <br>  It seems to me that people find all these petty similarities between faiths and assume they are causal, but really thats not true. All religions try to answer the same basic questions, so it shouldn't be surprising that they are similer in many ways.<br>  <br>  <br>  THE LIST GOES ON<br>  <br>  Baptism? We all wash our bodies with water, why is it so odd that multiple religions would wash their souls with a spiritual water? Its a pretty simple concept.<br>  <br>  Rabbits associated with Easter. Is it a symbol of firtility, or are rabbits just out and about in the spring? Find me a rabbit in the dead of winter or the hottest part of summer. Also, at no point in Ancient or Medieval christianity will you find rabbits associated with Easter. Thats purely a modern invention.<br>  <br>  Virgin Birth: What says "this guy is important" more than claiming he was born without intercourse?<br>  <br>  The Fish symbol: Has nothing to do with paganism.

aZUszuqLaa	We are all God's creations...every living thing.  Eating meat is not really good for you, it's just what we somehow "got used to" but mainly it's not good because of the way the animals are slaughtered.  They are frightened and horrified and bled out with all those bad feelings in them.  Animals should be blessed, if eaten, to thank them for their offering.<br>  I'm a biased animal lover, and believe that hunting for sport and cruelty to any living thing is a mistake.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	A righteous person has regard for the life of his animals. - Proverbs 12:10<br>  <br>  It is prohibited to kill an animal with its young on the same day, in order that people should be restrained and prevented from killing the two together in such a manner that the young is slain in the sight of the mother; for the pain of animals under such circumstances is very great. There is no difference in this case between the pain of people and the pain of other living beings, since the love and the tenderness of the mother for her young ones is not produced by reasoning but by feeling, and this faculty exists not only in people but in most living things. - Maimonides - Moshe ben Maimon (1135-1204) comments on Lev. 22:28 <br>  It should not be believed that all beings exist for the sake of the existence of man. On the contrary, all the other beings too have been intended for their own sakes and not for the sake of anything else. Maimonides - Moshe ben Maimon (1135-1204) <br>  <br>  Love of all creatures is also love of God, for whoever loves the One (God) loves all the works that He has made. When one loves God, it is impossible not to love His creatures. The opposite is also true. If one hates the creatures, it is impossible to love God Who created them . - Rabbi Judah Loew, The Maharal of Prague (1525-1609) <( he is also credited with the Golem legends to protect the Jews of Prague from the blood libel accusations)<br>  <br>  Here you are faced with God's teaching, which obliges you not only to refrain from inflicting unnecessary pain on any animal, but to help and, when you can, to lessen the pain whenever you see an animal suffering, even through no fault of yours. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888)  This obligation has been known and followed by Jews since ancient days. <br>  <br>  These commandmenst are called Tz’ar ba’ alei chayim , that the suffering of living things  is morally and religiously intolerable<br>  <br>  One thing that many people find surprising about Jews is that we are also obligated by Jewish law to feed our animals, including pets, before we eat.<br>  <br>  Most Jews I know, even those who are not very observant of any other laws or customs, observe this.  Both of my parents were raised this way ( mother raised Reform, father Orthodox) and I was raised this way, Reform and I've raised my son to observe this.<br>  <br>  Jews can only kill animals to meet an essential human need. Hunting for sport is not considered legitimate, and is not only discouraged in the Talmud, but is also prohibited in Jewish law.  <br>  Many great Jewish heroes were chosen because they showed kindness to animals. Moses and King David were considered worthy to be leaders (Exodus Rabbah 2:2). Rebecca was judged suitable to be Isaac's wife because of her kindness in providing water to the camels of Eliezer, Abraham's servant. There are many Torah laws involving compassion to animals. An ox is not to be muzzled when threshing in a field of corn (Deuteronomy 25:4). A farmer should not plow with an ox and an *** together (so that the weaker animal would not suffer pain in trying to keep up with the stronger one) (Deuteronomy 22:10). Animals, as well as people, are to be allowed to rest on the Sabbath day (Exodus 20:10). The importance of this verse is indicated by its inclusion in the Ten Commandments and its recitation as part of kiddush (sanctification ceremony using wine or grape juice) on Sabbath mornings. <br>  <br>  While permission to eat meat was given in the Torah, it is generally considered to be a concession to people's weakness, with many restrictions (the laws of kashrut). Rabbi Abraham Isaac Hakohen Kook, one of the greatest Jewish philosophers of the 20th century, and the first chief rabbi of pre-state Israel, believed that these many dietary constraints imply a reprimand, and are designed to keep alive a sense of reverence for life so that people would eventually return to God's original vegetarian diet (genesis 1:29). Rabbi Kook believed that the future Messianic period will be vegetarian. He based this on the words of Isaiah (11:6-9): "...the wolf shall dwell with the lamb...the lion shall eat straw like the ox...and no one shall hurt nor destroy in all of God's holy mountain." <br>  <br>  In summary, in view of Judaism's strong teachings with regard to preserving human health, treating animals with compassion, protecting the environment, conserving resources, and helping the hungry, and the very negative effects that the production and consumption of meat has in each of these areas, Jewish spirituality can best be enhanced through a diet with a minimum of and preferably no animal products.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	I think animal testing is cruel.<br>  <br>  They get all nervous and mess up their answers.|`|7ylYxklsaa	I'm one of the only Pagans I know that is not against hunting deer.

It is not a sin to kill animals with as little suffering as possible for food, clothing, and the health and safety of humans.<br>  <br>  ?

Our health code says that meat is ordained by God for our use, but God prefers us to eat it sparingly, only in times of winter or famine.  See Doctrine and Covenants 89:12-15 - <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89/12-15#12" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89/12-15...</a><br>  <br>  I researched to find out the reason why meat should be eaten sparingly.  There is an LDS scripture from the Joseph Smith Translation (an inspired correction) of the KJV of the Bible.<br>  <br>  JST Genesis 9:11 - <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jst/2" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jst/2</a> (Compare Genesis 9:3-9)<br>    11 And surely, blood shall not be shed, only for meat, to save your lives; and the blood of every beast will I require at your hands.<br>  <br>  There are other scriptures from the Bible that also have some pertinence to animal welfare, including: Prov. 12:10, <br>  Num. 22:21-35 (esp. v. 32); Luke 12:6 & Dan. 1.<br>  <br>  So, I am convinced in my heart that the best thing for a person to do regarding animals is to always treat them kindly, meet their needs, make them happy, etc, and eat them only when needed (and there is no sin in doing this).<br>  <br>  I, too, have seen the horrible things that animals in commercial production go through and believe that it is spiritually detrimental to eat the products of cruelty.  So, I choose to buy free-range eggs and chicken when I can (we eat a lot of eggs) but with four children, sometimes I have to take those (sickening) cage eggs, when the budget won't stretch.<br>  <br>  To respect both budget and conscience, my goal is to become self-reliant and to produce all my own animal products at home, through animals that I love and care for.  We're getting closer and closer to that goal.<br>  <br>  I don't judge other people or what they do regarding meat.  Life is complex and it is so hard to do everything perfectly and people are valuable (worthy of love & respect) even though imperfect.<br>  <br>  In a perfect world, all animals would be treated with kindness and respect.  Commerce should reflect that value... I think kind-hearted consumers and producers are making inroads.  Free-range, organic, cruelty free - are all becoming much more marketable products, even though they cost twice as much (or more) - people seem willing to pay for it to get peace of conscience.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I never knew that Kerry.

Everything found in the written Word of God, the Bible, is truth. Therein God declares his purpose to establish the rule of his kingdom over the earth, but the nations have failed to concede to the King appointed by Jehovah, Christ Jesus, and so place themselves in the direct path of Jehovah’s irresistible will. Failing to take Almighty God into consideration in what they are doing will lead the nations to complete disaster. “Why have the nations been in tumult and the national groups themselves kept muttering an empty thing? The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.

If six letters separated by a space indicates design, the unimaginably more complex message in a helix molecule of DNA proclaims a designer of unimaginably more intelligence and power.<br>  <br>  No, God does not believe in atheists, for his design is evident everywhere we look, and it proclaims the intelligence and power of the designer.|`|32xRsYa9aa	Hey Bruce,<br>  While atheists digress in their position, they remain Gods creation, just as we are.

Some people only think something is worth knowing or believing in if it can be seen, or varified, or tested.  But many things that we know, arent like that.  Moreover life and human existence itself cannot be so easily quantified and limited by such extremes.  To limit oneself to scientific knowledge is understandable to an extent, but let me be clear in stating that I think  it is limiting.  <br>  <br>  For me, to believe in God is reasonable, for very many reasons, all of which would take far too long to list here and some of which my simple writing would do little justice.  However, my reasonable belief in God doesn't amount to a scientific proof.  It isn't that kind of knowledge, nor could it ever be.  But that doesn't make it any more valuable or veracious.<br>  <br>  For some, God can be seen in everything.  Even in the deepest pains, for his Will and Love ordain them, that we all may be better when everything is said and done.  For some, nothing can convince them, even the deepest longing of their own hearts for meaning.  It is my most sincere belief that every human being is longing for meaning.<br>  <br>  "We desire truth, and find within ourselves only uncertainty. We seek happiness, and find only misery and death. We cannot but desire truth and happiness, and are incapable of certainty or happiness. This desire is left to us, partly to punish us, partly to make us perceive wherefrom we are fallen." - Blaise Pascal<br>  <br>  *add* - God does not "hide" behind natural processes, rather natural processes are a reflection of an aspect of God's nature.  The beauty of nature, of ourselves, of this vast universe is a question that is not contained in any scientific proof.  And yet it's beauty is still important to us.  The question, "where has everying come from" has not been proven by science.  As Aristotle demonstrated thousands of years ago, knowledge will only succumb to an infinite regress if one does not admit a given which exists in itself, outside of the chain of causation (God).  That is but one reasonable proof and a good one.  However, the mere fact that we human beings are not content with this life, that there is a deep spiritual thirst and longing for meaning, truth, beauty, understanding, an answer to suffering, etc.  is a reason to believe in a "Something." This longing is not a scientific knowledge either, but it is still valuable.|`|OavxFupIaa	I'm not sure what your question is, since there were several, but I will make an attempt regardless:<br>  <br>  1. Does God believe in atheists?<br>  This presupposes the existence of a deity, which commits the Begging the Question fallacy.  Your quote from the Bible does the same.<br>  <br>  2. Is God's creative power so clearly stamped on his creation as to be unmistakable, so that God's reality is self-evident?<br>  Not at all; we have excellent physical explanations for much of the "wonders" of nature.  Even if we didn't, assuming creation would commit the Argument From Ignorance fallacy.<br>  <br>  3. Or do atheists have a reasonable alternative explanation for the wonders of intelligent life in a designer world in a universe with an unmistakable beginning?<br>  This continues the Argument From Ignorance fallacy and creates a False Dichotomy fallacy.  Atheists don't need to have an explanation in order to discredit the God hypothesis.  This would be akin to saying: Atheists can't explain how the Earth was created, therefore it must have been made by a magical unicorn.<br>  <br>  I highly encourage you to research common logical fallacies.|`|o3GTW8i5aa	Hello Bruce.<br>  <br>  To your title question, I would have to answer yes, God does believe in Atheists.   He believes in all mankind, believers, unbelievers, the good and the not so good.   He knows all things and as such, must believe in all who exist in His creation.<br>  <br>  Atheists do exist and are, though they would not agree, a part of His creation.<br>  <br>  I tend to think He has them in mind quite a bit.   Jesus said the physician is not needed so much for the healthy as for the sick (my paraphrase).   He went through so much on our behalf I can't believe His concern ended with his resurrection.   This being the case, those who follow the Atheist belief when they need Him the most, will likely be struck all the harder with His presence.<br>  <br>  Saul who went on to become Saint Paul was struck blind by the power of Our Lord after persecuting Him and His people for so long.   Though he was a Jew and as such, believed in God, he was in effect atheistic in his belief in Jesus BUT Jesus obviously believed in Saul which is one part of my reasoning.   As we know, Saint Paul led the founding of Jesus' Church as strongly as any Apostle.<br>  <br>  Most Atheists, especially those we hear from in R&S are fairly young, I'd say ranging from their teens into their 30s.   Those years are the "world beater" years.   Most people are full of confidence in  themselves and their peers which is a good thing when it does not go into the excess.<br>  <br>  As I've said before, by negating God from existence Atheists, in their own minds elevate themselves to the highest form of known life.   They increase this (supposed) elevation even further by reminding all believers and each other of their "intelligence", "logic", "scientific knowledge", "theories" and "various hypothesis".   <br>  <br>  They elevate themselves to being their own gods much the same as someone who down-talks another believing they elevate themselves by doing so.<br>  <br>  A great many Atheists, probably most, do come to terms with God in time.   Age, maturity and life experience shows them no matter how much faith is put into intelligence, logic and education, they only lead to more questions without answers and more unprovable theories again without answers.   Maturity also tends to show even the staunchest "youth holder" how fallible both science and mankind itself is and how easily the geniuses fall from their own evolutionary ladders.<br>  <br>  God gave us free will but He does watch and He does act.   He does make Himself known.   The stronger the need, the more powerfully He will show Himself.   When Saul blinded himself to all the evidence of Jesus' authority, Jesus blinded him to all the world.

fEkKuGlEaa	Yes; God will forgive anything if forgiveness is asked for out of a true sense of repentance. Obviously this doesn't include people who don't feel they did wrong or have every intention of going out and committing the same thing over and over. That's not true repentance.   <br>  <br>  Why would God forgive? The Bible says mercy triumphs over judgment, and that God actively seeks to reconcile with those who wish to be reconciled with God.

5aqYVyvAaa	James 2:26 Faith without works is dead.<br>  <br>  Who is following the Bible to the best of their ability? The Bible says just because you have faith doesn't mean you'll make it. You have to live your life according to the Bible everyday. Which religion does the best job?<br>  <br>  The Bible says at Matt. 7:13-14 go thru the narrow gate because broad and spacious is the one leading to destruction and many are the ones going thru it, where as cramped and narrow is the road leading to life and few are the ones finding it.<br>  <br>  So yes 1000's of religions are saying the same thing but only a few are right according to the Bible. So again who is following the Bible the best?<br>  <br>  Here's another thing for you. John 15:17-21 Jesus said that the world hated him and will persecute him and they will hate and persecute his true followers.<br>  <br>  Which religion is hated the most? Which religion is it that when someone says they've changed their faith it's the ONLY one that is not acceptable? Which religion is it when people ask questions they will listen until they find out what faith you are?<br>  <br>  It's Jehovah's Witnesses|`|mimykKnhaa	hahaha brilliant. choose your religion based on what kind of punishment you want to avoid. i love it.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Religion is not as important as being spiritual.

It's very similar to Hinduism, but it lacks the caste system which is good. Also, it's not like Christianity in which you are born with your sins and must remove them. Buddhism gives you freedom of will and a healthy lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Definitely stay away from Scientology if nothing else. People adopted into the Church of Scientology have had bad things happen to them due to the higher up members. <br>  <br>  Confucianism is a philosophy, not a religion, so you won't be religious if you're following that.|`|rcCYssKYaa	You said you did your research, which is good.

(It is a Relationship with Him and the 'others' are just trying to sell you something!)  <')))><|`|AA10883660	How can a person know what is the right way to worship? How can he determine which is the true religion? Is there any sure way of identifying it?<br>  <br>  Yes, there is. Jesus Christ gave the rule for doing this. He explained that the true servants of God could be distinguished from the false ones by what they produce. He said: “By their fruits you will recognize them.” (Matt. 7:16) Therefore, it is possible to identify the true religion by the fruitage produced by its people.<br>  <br>  What, then, are some of the fine fruits that true worshipers would produce? Is there really one religion whose people stand out as different from all the others because of their producing these fruits?<br>  <br>                     1. Love Among Themselves<br>  <br>  Jesus said that having love among themselves would distinguish his true followers from other people. He said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:35.<br>  <br>  This love that would distinguish Christ’s true followers is not expressed merely with the lips, but it deeply affects their way of life. It influences their attitude toward peoples of all races and nationalities. Do the churches with which you are acquainted instill in their members such genuine love? For example, what happens when grievances between worldly nations lead to war?<br>  <br>  The facts show that by far the majority of religions have blessed their members who have taken up weapons and slaughtered their fellow believers of another race or nationality on the battlefields. Do you think that such a course is demonstrating love toward fellow believers? Could you, for instance, imagine Jesus preaching a sermon urging his disciples to kill one another at the command of the State just because they happened to be living in different nations? No, such a course is not in accord with the Bible, nor does it reflect the spirit of God.—1?John 3:10-12; Matt. 5:44.<br>  <br>  There is a religion, however, that refuses to become entangled in such strife in any way, regardless of the pressures brought upon it to do so. Magdalen Goffin, London history scholar, noted that during the second world war “the only group consistently to stand up to Hitler (and they are today repeating their defiance in the Soviet Union) were the Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Emphasizing the contrast, she said: “Both the Evangelical Church and [the] Catholic Church .?.?. became the tools of Fascism. For this the Catholic bishops and the Papacy must shoulder the main responsibility.”—The New York Review of Books, August 21, 1969.<br>  <br>                      2.Respect for God’s Word<br>  <br>  Another way in which the true religion can be identified is by its attitude toward God’s Word the Bible. Jesus at all times demonstrated respect for God’s Word, time and again appealing to it as the final authority on matters. (Matt. 19:4-6; Luke 24:44, 45) How do the churches of Christendom measure up in this regard? Do they have such deep respect for the Bible?<br>  <br>  Well, what have we seen in connection with a number of church teachings; for example, the Roman Catholic teaching on celibacy? Why, even Pope John XXIII said that “the Scriptures do not impose it.” The Scriptures, in fact, show that marriage for Christian ministers is proper. (1?Cor. 9:5; 1?Tim. 3:2, 12) Yet the church continues to impose celibacy upon its clergymen. Is it showing respect for the Bible to prescribe rules that are in opposition to Bible teachings?<br>  <br>  But there is a religion that is outstandingly noted for its adherence to and respect for the Bible. Last summer France-Soir, a leading French newspaper, said: “The doctrines of Jehovah’s witnesses are based on the Bible.” England’s Weekly News, September 27, 1969, also observed: “Perhaps the real secret of the Witnesses’ success is because they know their Bible so well, they’re able to answer any question convincingly with a Biblical quote.”<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s witnesses also build respect and confidence of others toward God’s Word, as the Catholic magazine Ave Maria, February 24, 1962, notes: They “are willing to spend any amount of time studying with an interested householder.”<br>  <br>                    3.Sanctify God’s Name<br>  <br>  The true religion also stands out from all others because of the concern it shows for God’s name, which the Bible reveals is Jehovah. (Ps. 83:18) Jesus set the example in honoring the name of God, making it known to his disciples, and even teaching them to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”—Matt. 6:9; John 17:6, 26.<br>  <br>  Well, then, do the churches of Christendom sanctify God’s name? Do they treat it as something holy, and make it manifest to mankind, as Jesus did? Is there a religious group that is prominently known for publishing the name of God?<br>  <br>  Yes, there is one religion whose people are outstandingly noted for their devotion to Jehovah! Marcus Bach, writing in Adult Student of November 1956, observed: “In the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses are people of every class and culture; but they all hold one element in common: allegiance to Jehovah.”<br>  <br>                  4.Proclaim the Kingdom of God<br>  <br>  The true religion can further be identified by its preaching of God’s kingdom. Jesus Christ also set the example in bearing this fruitage, for he journeyed “from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 8:1) And his first-century followers imitated him, calling with the Kingdom message “from house to house.”—Acts 20:20, 25.<br>  <br>  Who, then, are taking the Kingdom message to the homes of the people today, and doing it in the way Jesus and his apostles did? When you see a minister calling from house to house and you hear him talk about God’s kingdom as mankind’s true hope, with what religion do you usually associate him?<br>  <br>  Identifying that organization, Charles Samuel Braden writes in his book These Also Believe: “No single religious group in the world displayed more zeal and persistence in the attempt to spread the good news of the Kingdom than the Jehovah’s Witnesses.”<br>  <br>                        5.Separate from the World<br>  <br>  Yet another distinguishing mark of the true religion is its obedience to the Bible requirement to keep separate from the world and its affairs. Jesus Christ showed the proper position of true worshipers when he said: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.”—John 17:16.<br>  <br>  But what about the churches in your community? Are they and their clergy really “no part of the world”? Do they keep separate from its affairs? You know the answer to such questions.<br>  <br>  However, you probably also know about a people in your community who refrain from involvement in the world and its affairs. Commenting about Jehovah’s witnesses, Chicago Today, October 18, 1969, said: “Their belief pattern, moreover, calls for total noninvolvement with the political society in which they dwell.” They really are “no part of the world.”<br>  <br>  Has not this examination been helpful in identifying the true religion? Yes, it is by such an investigation that the true servants of God can be distinguished from the false ones. But there is another factor that bears consideration.<br>  <br>                       6.Prosperity of True Religion<br>  <br>  While the churches and their clergy are in confusion, disintegration and decline, there is a religion today that is enjoying marvelous spiritual prosperity. Newsweek of January 5, 1970, observes: “The Catholic diocese of Rothenburg [Germany], for example, reports that ‘entire families are suddenly converting to the Jehovah’s witnesses.’” Actually thousands of persons every week, on the average, are now associating with Jehovah’s witnesses and taking up true worship.<br>  <br>  What does all this indicate? Who are showing true Christian love? What religion is noted for its high regard for the Bible? Who are sanctifying, that is, treating as holy, God’s name Jehovah? What people are diligent in proclaiming the kingdom of God? And who keep separate from the world and its affairs?<br>  <br>  Yes, what religious group does all of these things? And which group has the evidence of God’s blessing?|`|hu9XQjVaaa	I think a lot of people choose whatever religion "feels right" to them.  So I guess that's what you should do...I do hope you become a Christian though!<br>  I believe Christian is the right religion and not just another one people created for their liking...you have to have a lot of faith for it...but here is some stuff:<br>  Jesus is the only person ever to claim to be God and the Son so he is either a lunatic,liar or really is the one true God (which I believe he is)<br>  the Bible never contredicts itself (as other books to) and the Bible was written over a period of 1500 years in 3 diffrent contanants by 40 diffrent authors...and all the poeple that wrote the Bible said the same thing...and it was inspired by God.<br>  If you ask God into your heart you will be saved to go to Heaven...but Christians keep asking for forgiveness for their sincs they commit.|`|WyMd0zlqaa	Something tells me you're being sarcastic. ;)<br>  <br>  ...Wicca doesn't believe in the Devil or Hell.

(im a Christian)<br>  I beleive that this is the right religion because all the large events that are described in the Bible have been archealogically proven right, so the rest of the bible is probably right. read on to find out why I beleive it still after i just said "probably". no matter what sombody tells you, the Bible passes all three tests people use to figure out if a document is true or not: the  internal test (examining the document and making sure it doesn't contradict itself, because if it did, of course you wuoldn't believe it. if somebody tells you the bible contradicts itself, they are wrong. the reason people think this is because it was origonally written in Greek and Herbrew. in both languages, one word might mean two or more things. in translation, stuff gets mixed up, even with how carfully the translators do it.), the external test (comparing the document with other thing happening at the time it was written or the time it's decribing), and the bibliographic test ( google it, i did this for schoolwork yesterday, but i haven't read that part yet).<br>  <br>  about the denomination part, evangelical free. sorry, i dont have an argument for this part, but you can google it and see what makes it different from denominations like adventists (the big difference of the bat there is that they worship on Saturday, which is an old Hebrew law, not relevant any more).<br>  <br>  what we beleive:<br>  <br>  God sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins (anything we say, do, or think that displeases Him), because otherwise we were going to go to hell. some Bible verses to keep in mind;<br>  <br>  john 3:16<br>  for God so loved the world that sent His only begotton Son, that we may beleive in him and have everlasting life.<br>  <br>  romans 6:36<br>  for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.<br>  <br>  ok, so what john 3:16 means is that God loved us, so he sent his only son to die on the cross for our sins, and that if we beleive Him, we will go to heaven and live with Him there for eternity. Romans 6:36 means that we had earned death (eternal death by condemnation to hell) by the very first two people on this earth going agains God's laws and sinning, so the entire race of man was plunged into sin. we deserve hell, but because god loved us too much to kill us, he made a way for us to be with him. He sent his Son to die on a roman cross after living a perfect life on earth. the way we can live with God in heaven for an eternity is that, if you beleive and accept that Jesus died on the cross and that you are a sinner, you can.<br>  there's so much I could say, but I don't have the time. if you want to learn more, (i hope you do!) contact me at <br>  addalineo@aol.com, and I'll see if I can hook you up with somebody who can explain it better.

Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me, Allah.<br>  <br>  A reply to the atheists:<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless but he found out more about Haqq (The Truth) and proclaimed Islam. <br>  <br>  Shaikh proves to the non believer that there is a God:<br>  <br>  Many, many years ago, there once lived a man who didn’t believe in Allah. And because he didn’t believe in Allah, he would mock at all the muslims about believing in One Allah . It so happened that a Sheikh was told about the man and his wicked ways. He thought long and hard about a plan and, at last, came up with a plan that Insha Allah, would work. <br>  <br>  He challenged all those who didn’t believe in God and fixed a time and date for this challenge. This challenge was to take place on an open ground, in which the Sheikh would prove to them that there was a God and only One God – Allah. <br>  <br>  <br>  On this day, thousands of people turned up for the event. Everyone, including the muslims were curious to see how the Sheikh would prove One Allah to them. So the muslims were seated on one side, and the disbelievers on the other side. Five minutes ticked by, then ten . . . But the Sheikh was nowhere to be seen. He had not turned up. <br>  <br>  The speaker of the disbelievers stood up and spoke to the people : “ It seems that we are all wasting our time ! Even the Sheikh knows that there is no God, that’s why he decided not to attend this meeting.” <br>  <br>  Just at that moment, the Sheikh arrived. <br>  <br>  <br>  “What took you so long ? It seems that you yourself are in doubt that there is a God!” laughed the disbeliever. <br>  <br>  But the Sheikh replied in a calm voice, “ You see, on my way here, there was a river to cross. I waited for the boat, but I could not see one. All of a sudden, a nearby tree walked towards the river bank and fell down in front of me. The bark peeled off automatically and started to chop itself into planks, all by itself. Then the bits and the planks began to fix itself and formed into a beautiful boat. I quickly got into the boat and it started to row, all by itself. This is how I got here.” <br>  <br>  <br>  The disbeliever laughed and told all the muslims, “What kind of Sheikh have you elected as your speaker ? He is insane ! How can a tree walk ? How can a tree peel itself ? How can a tree chop itself an and form into a boat ?” <br>  <br>  <br>  Then Sheikh spoke : “ This is just what I wanted to hear ! Just as a tree can’t form itself into a boat, how can the sun rise all by itself in the morning at its exact time ? <br>  <br>  How can it set each evening at its correct moment and place ? Who makes us breathe in air and who makes our heart beat ?” <br>  <br>  <br>  The disbeliever bowed down his head – he was speechless and he had no answer. <br>  <br>  “Allah, of course ! He is the Creator of the entire Universe,” the Sheikh said. <br>  <br>  <br>  Such was the effect of the Sheikh’s words and his beautiful invitation to Islam, that many of the disbelievers became muslims.|`|SM9rugibaa	Please believe me that there is a God. We would not be here if there was not a God.  Everything has a purpose and in the end, in spite of human adversity, there is another sphere in which all that is experienced in this life sheds light on the life we live after human life has ended.<br>  Please have faith.  Look at the sun and the moon and the stars and realise that it is not human beings who have the last word.  Human beings did not create the world, they simply inhabit it.<br>  Simply live your life.  Do not deliberately hurt anyone. Help anyone if it is possible that you can do so.<br>  Please have faith in God. If Christ could give up his life for people he had not even encountered, he is an inspiration.

Where is your intelligence?<br>  <br>  If after reading the Bible you believe there is no God then I believe you to be a sad person indeed. If you can read the Bible, of which only the New Testament is Christian, and it has not touched you as being the truth then you perhaps are lacking the vital spark that God looks for in a faithful person.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would really read the Bible more thoroughly, in this is the route to salvation for it is the word of God. He inspired men to write His words that future generations might not be in darkness.<br>  <br>  The Quran came long after the books of the Bible were written and made a poor hash of interpreting it. Substituting Ishmael for Isaac presumably so that the promises of God went their way. Ishmael had a very different promise given to him. Muslims speak of the errors of the Bible but the find of the very old scroll of the book of Isaiah shows just how free of error it is.<br>  <br>  The Bible offers so much that it is a hard hearted person indeed that does not respond to it when they really understand it. Do give it the time it needs to understand it, a superficial reading will not be useful to anyone. Read it all. Reread it. It offers salvation. Do respond to it positively.|`|26DoxkOBaa	You're entitled to your own opinion, but reading books won't give you an experience of the infinite, and if you want to have a get an answer about if God exists or not, you're going to have to have that experience.

I suppose it could be said that what is written in a book and believed by people doesn't affect reality one way or the other, so if the book we call the Bible isn't true, this would not affect God one way or the other.  He could still exist and so would you even though you are not mentioned in the Bible, either.  This because your existence is also separate from the Bible.  In other words, the Bible doesn't create God, nor eliminated Him.  If someone says, "The Bible is untrue, therefore I don't believe in God" only shows just how ignorant he actually is.  He is saying that the Bible MUST create God if it is a book of truth.  In reality the Bible is a written record of the Word of God and teaches us about Him.  So someone can say that they don't believe in the Bible, OR believe in a God either and I'll not argue with him unless he asks me about it.  God bless, and good luck.|`|WalnRzfGaa	i would not say that God is a lie, but the God demonstrated in the Bible would be a lie.|`|UWKF7x4faa	No|`|52cdjmbQaa	Yes, God is a lie.|`|EzZgHpbDaa	i don't believe in any gods, but i'm not following your logic.|`|ODTe2l77aa	I don't think everything in the Bible is a lie.

Well, kind of.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	It just means that that particular god is a lie.<br>  <br>  If the bible is disproven, which it is, then you can't trust anything that it says.  It is clearly not the perfect word of a god.  So unless the rest of the book has evidence to back it up, it can be discarded.<br>  <br>  Now... if the god described in that book was described inaccurately, but does exist, then that god, one would think, would correct the inaccuracies.  He has not.<br>  <br>  Therefore that god either does not exist, or doesn't care.  In either case, I seriously doubt that that god would blame a sane human being for not believing something that is clearly, and UNDENIABLY, false.
yj5YeCvaaa	A very cool place. My parents were born there and I've been twice in my life. Not as dangerous as portrayed in films, but one should be cautious in certain parts of the cities, and never go into a "favela" unless your there to buy drugs. Some cops in Rio are corrupt, when I last visited, they caught my cousin leaving the favela with weed, and told him to withdraw money from an ATM or they would arrest him. After he got them the money (200 reias(spelling?)) they let him go and even let him keep the weed. Other than the cops and robbers, its a very nice place with beautiful women. The weed in Rio was ok at best. The drinking age is 18, but I was 16 when I last went and was able to drink at just about every bar.

People from the United States do not have a specific national adjective.<br>  <br>  This springs from the fact that during the formation of the country, most people considered themselves citizens of their respective states rather than members of a larger nation.

vmv1rP76aa	Because those who have not experienced a certain religion or faith often judge and condemn those without fully understanding it. <br>  <br>  I used to be a Catholic, but I was never told to worship Mary, worship statues, and we were taught the Trinity of Father/Son/Holy Spirit.

I reach that limit when it comes to Mormonism, which I do not respect at all; I think its beliefs are plain barking, although I may well respect Mormons as people.<br>  <br>  Catholicism?  Clearly an ancient and rich tradition within Christianity, with much to admire.  I've shared in Catholic worship and count a few priests among my friends; but that does not mean I have to accept what your tradition tells me about Mary.  I'm a liberal and hold that there is no basis for taking the Nativity stories as literal history; you clearly do so, and on that we can agree to differ.

On other issues I get more stroppy, in particular the Catholic line on birth control, which I think is, frankly, evil.  <br>  <br>  Don't tell me I "misunderstand", I have read the relevant literature - have you? - but I think your Church has got this one very badly wrong.  Which also means, since he was instrumental in holding the reactionary line against contraception, that I don't have much respect for the views of your present Pope either, although I have enjoyed and used some of his devotional writings in the past.

The thief should have reached adulthood<br>  2. The thief has to steal from a secured location. If he stole from somewhere that was not secured,his hands wont be cut<br>  3.The stolen item should be of higher value than a certain amount (quarter of a dinar of Gold).<br>  4. The theft should happen in secret and not in public with the knowledge of the owner of the stolen item<br>  5. The defendant can forgive the thief, and his hands not cut off<br>  6. The act of theft should not happen in a year where there is hunger or drought.<br>  There are more conditions that I can list for you. So it is not very simple for the hands of a theif to be cut.<br>  <br>  Moreover, they actually do not cut the hands of the thief. They cut the fingers of the right hand, while leaving the sole of the hand and the thumb.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I belive that theft would come down if this law is applied.

qEqMRTQkaa	Dude, do you realize that Satan owns you?|`|uzczwVT1aa	Salam. We can’t judge in Allah’s place, and to those Muslims here who are saying that they will go to hell: stop it, its haram to specify hell for anyone. Christians are People of the Book, and so are the Jews, and it says in the Qur’an:<br>  <br>  2:62 – ‘Those who believe (in the Qur’an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), And the Christians and the Sabians, Any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.’<br>  <br>  It even says this again:<br>  5:69 – ‘Those who believe (in the Qur’an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians, - Any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, And work righteousness,- On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.’<br>  <br>  For anyone who is good in this life:<br>  <br>  6:160 – ‘He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: No wrong shall be done unto them.’<br>  <br>  24:38 – ‘That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace: For Allah doth provide for those whom He will, without measure.’<br>  <br>  21:47 – ‘We shall set up scales of justice for the day of Judgement, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least.

And when you come to this conclusion, as commanded by Jesus clearly and directly, you will know that message of all the prophets was exactly the same, be it Moses, Jesus, Ibrahim, Mohammad peace be upon them. And you will know why so many prophets were sent on this earth by God, to keep guiding people to truth. And if you ignore Jesus clear commandments, you will not be one of his sheep. <br>  <br>  <br>  The teachings of the Church contradict the teachings of Jesus (pbuh) and that is the cause of the confusion. <br>  If a sincere christian who wants to follow Jesus (peace be upon him), asks priests about trinity, the answer that he gets is "It is a Mystery, not explained by Jesus (pbuh) clearly", at that time again those forget that Jesus (pbuh) said, <br>  <br>  "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing" (John 18:20 (NKJ)). <br>  <br>  If trinity is confusing enough to be called a mystery, it cannot be from God. Because:<br>  "God is not a God of confusion."—1 Corinthians 14:33, Revised Standard Version (RS). <br>  <br>  There was no mystery in the message of Jesus (pbuh), nothing secret. Will you accept the priests' so called "mystery of trinity" and forget clear commandments of Jesus (pbuh)? <br>  <br>  Jesus (pbuh) clearly said:<br>  <br>  A) Mark 12:29: "the Lord our God, the lord is One". <br>  B) Metthew: 26:39: "He went a little farther and fell on His face and prayed" (Following Jesus (pbuh) way is following what he did). Jesus (pbuh) prayed to one God<br>  C) Matthew 4:10 "You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him only you shall serve" <br>  D) John 5:19: "Most truly I say to you, the son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative but only what he beholds the father doing."<br>  E) John 7:16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me <br>  F) Matthew 27:46:  "Eloi (Allah?) , Eloi, lama sabachthani?" -- which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" <br>  (G)Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  John 8:54<br>  <br>  <br>  The trinity is a doctrine from about the year 325 AD, It has its roots in polytheism, It is not in the bible unless you really, really stretch it to fit. Jesus didn't have to hide the concept of trinity if it were the basis of salvation. <br>  <br>  The New Catholic Encyclopedia - 1967, VOL. XIV, PAGE 299:<br>  The formulation "one God in three Persons" was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 4TH CENTURY. But it is precisely this formulation that first claimed to title "The Trinitarian Dogma. AMONG THE APOSTOLIC FATHERS, THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY APPROACHING SUCH A MENTALITY OR PERSPECTIVE. <br>  <br>  <br>  You should not accept the word “son” literally . Word "son" was used in bible for general human beings and other prophets also. "we all are the children of father in heavens" indicates that word "son" was used in different meaning of love and care. Mathew: 5:9. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus , Moses, Mohammad (peace be upon them), they all worshiped the same God, the God of Ibrahim (pbuh). All prophets taught "surrendering one's will to God" that is the meaning of word "Islam". JAMES 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims love Jesus (pbuh), they believe in his miraculous birth with the will of God without a father or sexual act (the way Adam was born without a mother and father), , they believe in miracles that Jesus (pbuh) performed with permission of God, muslims faith demands them to believe Jesus (pbuh) was a great prophet of God and belief in the original message of Jesus (pbuh) the massaya.<br>  <br>  There was just not one holy book sent by God on earth through His messengers. The last testiment "Quran" had to be there  from the same source, revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (pbuh), an illiterate person who didn't know how to read or write) some 600 years after Jesus (pbuh) corrects the errors that crept (knowingly or unknowingly) into the message that Jesus (pbuh) brought. Unlike Bible that was written after decades after Jesus by people who never met Jesus, this book was not preserved on paper or in one church but in hearts of thousands of muslims who memorised Quran word by word the way it was revealved. Quran should prove to be a very valuable asset to both Muslims and Christians.|`|7fd589dc4431e750496582f9313e31cdaa	it's not us who's gonna judge you..it's our god..ur and my god...i don't hate u..i hate the fact that you still don't worship  Allah The Most Compassionate The Most Glorious the most merciful....i love ALLAH i wish you could just see the truth<br>  <br>  p.s:read the Quran and you'll know the truth

The sin we get from Adam and Eve. It is 'erased' by Baptism.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actual sin-- the sins we commit here on earth by breaking one of God's commandments.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus died for us to open the gates of Heaven. Up until the time of His death, Heaven was reserved for heavenly beings, not humans. Humans up to that time just died. The end. Since Jesus was human AND divine, God opened Heaven up to Jesus at His death. Since Jesus was part human, he is able to get the rest of us humans into heaven as well. I think in common vernacular, this is called 'piggy backing.'<br>  <br>  Jesus' death did not cause sin to be eradicated. It just gave us a way to get rid of our sin so that we could join Him in heaven. We still choose to commit earthly sin (which we can 'eradicate' through a variety of ways.) <br>  <br>  And we are still born with original sin-- the sin of humanity, caused by Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. That sin is easily eradicated by Baptism.|`|XZbYHcHiaa	Original sin makes no sense.It's basically priests holding a gun to our head and saying follow us.<br>  <br>  Our deeds matter, nothing else does.

I find sexist elements in some factions of Christianity as well that are contrary to my own values but if they aren't trying to impose them as some Islamists do in Sharia law then its to each their own. I find Christians who want to impose laws banning marriage to same sex couples a dangerous start that direction though. Of course societies need rules but they should be based on protecting liberties, human rights for diverse peoples, and maintaing security of person and property. Fundamentalists who cling to literal interpretations of holy texts so tightly they must censor modern findings that contradict them are not a positive thing for the progress of humanity in my eyes either.|`|saDjgQkxaa	I don't hate a specific religion.

Scientists don't accept evolution as fact. Sure, its a scientific theory supported by alot of evidence, but science never declares anything as "fact." That would be against the nature of science.<br>  <br>  Look, I accept evoltution and think anybody who doesn't is misguided. But the nature of science is knowledge through debate. Their are no "facts" only arguements based on evidence.<br>  <br>  RESPONCE<br>  <br>  Obviously you arn't much of a scholar. In all academic fields nothing is considered a "FACT." You can post something 2 or even 200 scientist have said, that doesn't make it any closer to fact. Science is debate at its very core. For example, some scientists considered the Law of the Conservation of Mass to be fact, guess what, it was disproven. Some scientists considered The Constant Speed of Light to be a fact, well it seems to be slowing down. Because of this the SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY never calles anything fact, they simply state that something is the best accepted theory untill a better one comes along. Don't you get it? This is why science is great, it is constently updateing itself with bigger and better arguements.<br>  <br>  Also, Evolution is not fact because, well plenty of scientists disagree with the theory. Personally, I don't agree with their arguements, but they are out there. But, more importantly, very few scientists agree on the means by which we have evolved. Did we evolve from monkeys? Well their are very significant arguments that suggest we didn't, that our origins come from something else entirely.<br>  <br>  This is what bothers me so much about you evolutionist eliteists. You quote scientists like Christians quoting the Bible. You have no understanding of the nature of science, or acedemic research in general.<br>  <br>  Well mister Rhodes Scholar, I couldn't possibly imagine why your career in Biology didn't pan out.

houWY7qvaa	Yes I agree that you can be Christ-like without faith and perhaps get a pass into the kingdom especially when confronted by God himself on the subject of not believing, but to think you could ultimately destroy what others put their faith in and not have any consequences to your hurtful actions is not being realistic.

These stories became Noah and the Ark, the moses character, and genesis as the hebrews plagarized these stories into their own emerging religious myths.  Plagarized material means there was no divine inspiration--and therefore the story is as mythical as the stories they came from.<br>  <br>  2.  Complete lack of historical verification of most of the bible.  The biggies just don't seem to have anysupport whatsoever.  There is 0 evidence that anything that had to do with the exodous ever happened.  nO evidence at all that the hebrews were ever in bondage in egypt--no evidence of the plagues, the exodous, the wanderings in the desert for 40 years, and finaly no evidence of the hebrew occupation in the land of milk and honey till a millenia later.  The bible seems to be like the Harry Potter novels--some of the towns and cities talked about are real enough--but the magics and the like simply have no basis in historical fact. Move on to the NT--you find that jesus of nazerth was from a town that never existed until the 4th century.  There was no nazerth.  No evidence of any of the miraculous occurances that were purported to him.. No record in the hebrew books of the temple curtian being rent--no local historial verification of eclipses--earthquakes--the dead rising--in short history is totally silent on this jeus until a generation later.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Right before acknoledging Atheism, I asked him with an honest heart to reveal himself tangibly to me.<br>  <br>  He didn't.<br>  <br>  The bible is pretty clear that God has no problem revealing himself in tangible ways to his followers and even his enemies.

For discussion sake I will assume that you are a Christian and that you were raised as one.  Did you ever at some point as you were approaching adulthood reflect and examine everything you had been taught about God as a child?  Did you ever make a conscious decision, based on your own thought process, that there definitely was a God or did you just kinda go with the flow and maintain the religion you were raised with?  Christians often say that atheists can't understand them.  My response is that since most atheists I know went through the scenario I described, no Christian can understand an atheist mindset unless they went through something similar, a conscious examination of their beliefs.  The conclusions they came to were different but the process would have been the same.  The end result of that self examination is that they both believe that they know the truth about the existence of God.<br>  <br>  If you consider that a philosophical rant then so be it.

"Void" refers to the Median exile (371-356 BCE.). "Darkness" -- the Greek exile (318-138 BCE). "The face of the deep" -- to the last exile of Rome (approx. 63 BCE until the present day).

Aa6XHuENaa	sindidit!|`|355JLlcLaa	The writers of Genesis probably weren't concerned with whether Adam and Eve had navels. That wouldn't have affected the reason the story was devised. The story seems to have been a way of explaining why hardships and death came into the world; and, like the Greek story of Pandora, the patriarchal, male-dominated society blamed women.<br>  <br>  There are generally taken to be two creation myths in Genesis. The creation of humanity is central to the second one. In this older narrative the first woman is created after the first man (Adam), from his body (Genesis 2:21-22), a situation which no doubt reflects the dominant position of males in a patriarchal society. But the implied inferior status of women becomes explicit only after the fall from grace in Eden, when God tells the woman: "your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you" (Genesis 3:16). Adam then gives his partner a name, Eve,an act that echoes his naming of the beasts, which expressed his dominion over animalkind. However, this account stresses, even more strongly than the first, the unity of the sexes and their mutual need. God says: "It is not good that man shall be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner" (Genesis 2:18). Only woman proves suitable for this role.<br>  <br>  The first man and the first woman live in a state of primaeval leisure and innocence in the garden of Eden until, tempted by the serpent, they eat the fruit of the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in defiance of God's wishes. It was one of two trees in the garden, the other being the "tree of life".<br>  <br>  These trees are thought to represent two originally separate traditions which the biblical author has brought together to express his view of the origin of the human condition. The first tree belongs to a distinctly Israelite tradition. The "knowledge of good and evil" probably means the capacity for rational and ethical judgement. This attribute belongs supremely to God, who forbids humans to acquire it. After the first human pair has defied his command, God condemns them and their descendants to a life of toil and pain. <br>  <br>  He drives them from the garden in order to deny them the fruit of the tree of life, which would bestow the other divine attribute, eternal life (Genesis 3:22-24). Thus humans are like God in one respect but, unlike him, they die. In this distinction lies the vast potential but also the limitation of human existence.<br>  <br>  A sacred tree that confers eternal life occurs in many mythologies and is common in Near Eastern iconography. Numerous myths of the region explain that humanity is mortal because one person failed to eat a magical food that would have made them live forever (one example is found in the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh). But the story in Genesis is alone in stressing that humans continue to suffer death as a direct consequence of their disobedience to God's command.|`|T7iTH5B9aa	Characters in fairy tales do not exist, so they could not really have belly buttons.  You are on your way to becoming an intelligent, free thinker.  Congrats!  Posters like Soldier of Christ might try to stone you, so be careful!|`|RfOLqUKlaa	faithfullylitha has opened my eyes.

S5QkXLsUaa	Agree with the person above. Not everyone celebrates Christmas. Some celebrate Hanukkah or Kwanzaa, and we can't forget atheists. Those are just the dominant ones. There are plenty of other minority rituals or religions that don't get as much coverage. Saying 'Merry Christmas' to a complete stranger or to a person who isn't of the same religion as we are would not only be weird but can be perceived as ignorant by some. In order to take into account all the people of different beliefs it's easier to simply wish them 'Happy holidays'. That way no one can feel offended and Ya can still extend your wishes onto them not knowing what fraction they are ;)|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Because not all Americans celebrate Christmas, and because there are other holidays that fall around the same time, including Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	It's political correctness. "Happy Holidays" embraces all the celebrations of the season, including Diwale, Chanukkah, Id el Fitr and Christmas  -- not to mention the New Year. Many so-called Christmas carols are very secular -- eg. Jingle Bells -- and make no mention of Christmas. Even St Valentine's Day isn't called such in the United States -- it's Valentine's Day. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately this is spreading to neighbouring countries.|`|uBgMPZsuaa	Well, because not everybody celebrates "christmas", the christian celebration of the birth of Jesus. But everybody celebrates the season, and the festivities of being with the family and such...<br>  Is much polite to wish a happy season of festivities, that to assume everybody celebrates the birth of jesus|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	This is what is known as 'Polical Correctness' where we are all things to all men and where no one is wrong and no one is responsible for anything and no one is to be offended. <br>  I think I'll quit while I'm ahead here.|`|u9eudX82aa	Uhm, idk what world you've been living in, but I'm American and I always say Merry christmas, as do all my friends.

KkTJf8kWaa	One-day is like a thousand years? As soon as you say that a year to god could be any number of years. Then you're saying that every word in the bible could mean something else. I've asked every religious figure that I have come in contact with and they all said the same thing. The bible was written by man, edited by man and interpreted by man. No, dinosaur remains are not fake.|`|DtlQawvgaa	Tanniyn occurs 28 times in the Bible and is normally translated “dragon.” It is also translated “serpent,” “sea monster,” “dinosaur,” “great creature,” and “reptile.” Behemoth and Leviathan are relatively specific creatures, perhaps each was a single kind of animal. Tanniyn is a more general term, and it can be thought of as the original version of the word “dinosaur.” The word “dinosaur” was originally coined in 1841, more than three thousand years after the Bible first referred to “Tanniyn.”<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|a2fgPVEyaa	The Bible does say that each of these things were created on 'days'. However, it doesn't specify how long these days are.  You have to realize that God and Heaven are eternal, so a day could be measured in twenty four hours like we do but, they could also have been measured in a span of 100 million years. We really just have no way of knowing.  The Bible also failed to mention thousands of other living things that are real, just because we have no specific mention of dinosaurs in the Bible, doesn't mean they didn't exist.  <br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful!<br>  <br>  God bless...|`|Uzf5uE93aa	In the Bible [at least the King James Version Bible] in the book of Genesis [written by Moses] it does talk about dinosaurs.  But you have to realize that the word 'dinosaur' is meant to be used by the average person, kind of like we say mono but doctors say mononucleosis.  I know that there are some scientific terms for dinosaur, but dinosaurs are reptiles, and the Bible does talk about snakes and dragons being made.  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Dinosaur fossils were not being found and assembled at the same time the genesis story was composed.  The days of creation is to set up the sabbath, put forth a crude life grouping, and to make the point that god was responsible for it all.  The days cannot be taken literally.

It is a mythology.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) How come the bible failed to mention the dinosaurs on the 5th and 6th day of creation?<br>  <br>  It failed to mention *nearly* every zoological classification of animals *by name*.  However, both days are *very* inclusive - that is, all water-dwelling creatures and flying creatures (day 5), all land-crawling creatures (day 6).<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Does this mean that the dinosaur remains are fake?<br>  <br>  No.  What it probably means is that you have not read these passages for yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) If the bible was true...<br>  That would mean that the dinosaurs and men were both created in succession of 2 days.<br>  <br>  No - proving that you have not read it.  It would mean that dinosaurs were created on the same "day" as humans.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) But the earliest found evidence of man was 2 million years ago and dinosaurs over 200 million years ago<br>  <br>  Well, first - obviously, I would think - that evidence (radiometric dating) is contestable.  However, let's assume that the evidence is sound.  What does the bible tell us?  Here is the order of creation given in Genesis 1<br>  a) plants<br>  b) water-dwelling animals<br>  c) flying creatures (insects, perhaps?)<br>  d) land-dwelling animals<br>  e) humans<br>  <br>  SO, unless you insist on the very narrow interpretation that the word "day" in Gen 1 can only mean a 24-hour day (which is not the case - that word can have other meanings in both Hebrew and in English), what we have here is complete agreement with modern theories of species evolution regarding the order of creation.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Because the Bible is not a paleontology textbook. It is a spiritual guide for Christians. Most Christians believe that the six "days" of creation are symbolic. God did not exist within a traditional time framework, which people invented themselves centuries later. So how many "days" it took to make the earth is completely irrelevant. And the dinosaurs not being there is completely irrelevant. You may as well ask why the dinosaurs don't appear in the U.S. Constitution. What difference does it really make? None!|`|OItPJZjBaa	Very interesting question. I personally believe that the dinosaurs are real and I only believe in the Bible to a point. My personal theory  is this, if both the dinosaurs and the Bible are real, I think that God may have created the universe well after the dinosaurs were extinct. That's just my thoughts. Hope this helps:)|`|OoOJr1fIaa	how can you say that? we don't know what = 1000 years. the earth could have been created in  6000 years, 6 million, 6 billion or 6 trillion, that would give God plenty of time to make and brake the whole menagerie of animal creations|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	The "young earth" crowd, along with the biblical literalists will tell you that it's not the Bible that's flawed but that the fossil record is either faked, or wrong.

Christians feel that way<br>  There are factions in the Christian community that say they are even more special than the other christians (lower case "c".)  There is a lot of back biting.<br>  <br>  Jesus' message is that we are all God's Children.  That God lives within us and loves unconditionally. (There is nothing you have to do, or nothing you can't do to earn God's love.)<br>  When we express Love, we are expressing the True Nature of God.   Lots of SPIRITUAL PEOPLE express this attribute without wanting to call themselves Christian (of any type, born-again, evangelical, Catholic, Mormon....all use the same scripture, all believe they have the power to send the rest of humanity to Hell.  Not a very loving thing for them to do, is it?)<br>  <br>  You can follow the true message of Jesus, but be aware the purpose of your teachers: many want to separate you from other people - that  is not Jesus' message. Run from those people.<br>  <br>  Study groups of a Course in Miracles teach Jesus' message - no religion needed.<br>  Unity Church of Practical Christianity also teach Jesus' message and study the Bible from a loving point of view.  You might be happy with this group.|`|tOWqXCdtaa	God is Love. All children will disapprove of their parents' discipline though.

Polygamy started back with the wives Leah and Rachael when their father Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah as well as Rachael. <br>  <br>  As we can see it didn't work out well for them.

It was simply how the culture worked. The more kids a man had, the better off his family was. This was because if a man was a farmer, and had 10 kids, his kids would work on the farm, and he would be able to produce more goods than if he had 5 kids helping him.  It was like this for anything whether it be farmers, blacksmiths, tailors, whatever.More kids mean more work, more work means more money earned.<br>  <br>  Obviously the richer you were, the more wives you could afford to have, and thus the more kids you could have in your family.<br>  <br>  It is not the Bible that determines whether polygamy is right or wrong, it is the culture.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	But you are incorrect.   Isn't it ironic that some, who have never seen the papyrus of the Book of Abraham, can claim that it is a funerary text, ie claim that it is in fact a text of something, only to also claim that since we also do not have access to the gold plates, then the Book of Mormon is false.   In my view, critics cannot have it both ways.<br>  <br>  No one besides Joseph Smith has seen the papyrus text that the Book of Abraham has come from.   Critics base their intrepretation of the entire book being a funerary text, only by their interpertive assumptions about the pictographic display contained in the Book of Abraham.   They miss the point.   It is but a pictograph describing an event that occured to Abraham.  It is not a pictograph describing the entire contents of that book of scripture.<br>  <br>  Again, no one has seen the papyrus, yet feel able to claim the Book of Abraham is something that it is not.  <br>  <br>  The entire point here, is that God requires us to live in faith.  Has anyone actually seen God lately?  You believe in him based on the principle of FAITH.<br>  <br>  You believe in the Bible based upon the principle of FAITH.

Don't fall for it if the so called Roman Catholic church of the present should choose to reunite with the Orthodox.  Rome is no longer Catholic.  If there was to be a real and true reunion between the two religions, the Orthodox would all have to convert to Catholicism end of story.  That is the only way that we could have a reunion.  Just look at the present Vatican right now.  They don't even recognize traditional Catholics as being in communion with them, and all we are are pre Vatican II Catholics who refused to accept the heretical and blasphemous changes of the second Vatican council.    So my warning to you Orthodox is don't fall for it if there is a reunion with the novus ordo and the Orthodox.  There was never a union to begin with as the novus ordo was created in 1967 and is not Catholic.  And Benedict XVI is not Catholic.  He is an anti pope.

HBp5r76haa	CJ gave a good answer, but it is incomplete.<br>  <br>  Jesus talked about this in the following passage:<br>  --------<br>  22Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. 23All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"<br>  <br>   24But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebub,[d] the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."<br>  <br>   25Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? 27And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 28But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br>  <br>   29"Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.<br>  <br>   30"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. 31And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.  (Matthew 12:22-32)<br>  -----------------------------<br>  <br>  Jesus was referring to the fact that the Pharisees were assigning His power of rebuking demons to Satan, when in fact it was His Spirit (the Holy Spirit) who was doing the work.

And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: <br>  <br>  Paul had his detractors back then too, here is what Peter said about them:<br>  <br>  2 Pet. 3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Chow, Paul didn't write Acts or 2 Peter, so the basis for your rebuttal is incorrect.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Oh, you mean the Bible w/ the OT, and the NT that contains all of those letters from Paul to the church?<br>  <br>  You have no proof that Paul was a false teacher.  He was chose by Jesus to bring the good news to people.|`|M7GVkERSaa	Paul was an apostle chosen by Jesus. His word is the truth.|`|qBnYCd9Naa	Actually, Saul of Tarsus was a Jew who hated Christians. But on the road, Saul became Paul, and abandoned his hatred to preach Jesus and Him crucified. Not a single teaching of Paul contradicts a single teaching of Jesus. So, I'm a little confused as to why you think you have a point there.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the one who came to Saul of Tarsus on the road. It was Jesus who commissioned Paul to teach Christ and Him crucified. Wouldn't this imply that Jesus wanted Paul to be listened to? Again, not sure why you think you have a point.<br>  <br>  So, it's a rule that if someone is not prophecied about, than their works are illegitimate? Where does the bible say that?<br>  <br>  <br>  ShawnB - why would you even mention Thomas Jefferson? What does the personal belief of a forefather have to do with any of this? Because I bet you're attempting to imply that our founding fathers did not intend for church and state to be mixed. Well, in that debate, we are not interested in the PERSONAL beliefs of the founding fathers, we are interested in their OFFICIAL actions in government. And, if you look only at their official actions in government, you see they fully intended for Christianity to be blended with state. So, who cares what Thomas Jefferson wrote in a PRIVATE letter to the Danbury Baptists, and who cares what his personal take on rabbi Paul was. If you want to try and pretend our founders did not officially endorse and promote Christianity, then you will have to give evidence from their official actions in governing this nation. By the way, I know why you and others like you tend to stay away from talking points about official actions, and tend to only bring up private, personal beliefs - it's because you know if you talked about official actions, you lose the debate every time.

They're just one of many.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  citation: Can't recall ---<br>  <br>  You are a metabolic organism.<br>  As such, you are basically a collection of replicative proteins that function according to metabolic chemical reactions and processes. A virus is similar, in that it too is a replicative protein complete with mutable DNA and RNA, just as you have. But viruses lack metabolism, and so may not be considered to be alive in the same manner that you definitely are. <br>  <br>  You are a eukaryote.<br>  All remaining organic life is distinguished by structural differences at the cellular level between different groups of prokaryotes (which are essentially bacteria) and the eukaryotes (us). Unlike bacterial or viral cells, our cells have a nucleus. Hence, all non-viral / bacterial lifeforms are as we are; eukaryotes. <br>  <br>  You are an animal.<br>  Now I've heard a few creationists argue that there are plants and there are animals and then there are human beings. And that none of them are actually related to one another other than through a common creator. They adamantly argue that we are not animals, as if there is some insult in that association. But you are one of only about a half-dozen kingdoms of eukaryotic life forms. Unlike those of most other biological kingdoms, you are incapable of manufacturing your own food and must compensate for that by ingesting other organisms. In other words, your most basic structure requires that you cause death to other living things. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a means of digestion. This, along with some very specific anatomical differences in the chemical composition of our metazoic cells, are the factors that define and distinguish an animal like yourself from all other kingdoms of life. Given the alternative choice between plants, molds, or fungus, animalia should seem reasonable even to the most adamant fundamentalist. <br>  <br>  You are a chordate.<br>  You have a spinal chord and every other minute physical distinction of that classification. You also have a skull, which classifies you as a craniate. Note: Not all chordates have skulls, or even bones of any kind. Once one of the chordates has enough calcium deposited around the brain to count as a skull, all of its descendants will share that. This is why absolutely all animals with skulls have spinal chords. And that is yet another commonality that implies common ancestry as opposed to common design. <br>  <br>  You are a vertebrate.<br>  Like all mammals, birds, dinosaurs, reptiles, amphibians, and most fish, you have a spine. Not everything with a spinal cord has a spine to put it in, but everything with a spine has a spinal cord in it, implying common descent. <br>  <br>  Every animal that has a jaw and teeth (Gnathostomata) also has a backbone. And of course, you have both as well, again implying common descent. <br>  <br>  You are a tetrapod.<br>  You have only four limbs. So you are like all other terrestrial vertebrates including frogs. Even snakes and whales are tetrapods in that both still retain vestigial or fetal evidence of all four limbs. This is yet another consistent commonality implying a genetic relationship. There certainly is no creationist explanation for it. <br>  <br>  You are synapsid.<br>  Unlike turtles (which are anapsid) and "true" reptiles, dinosaurs and birds (which are all diapsid), your skull has only one temporal fenestra, a commonality between all of the vast collection of "mammal-like reptiles", which are now all extinct without any Biblical recognition or scriptural explanation either for their departure or their presence in the first place. <br>  <br>  You are a mammal.<br>  You are homeothermic (warm-blooded), follicle-bearing and have lactal nipples. And of course, not all synapsids are or were mammals, but all mammals are synapsid, implying common descent. <br>  <br>  You are eutherian.<br>  Or more specifically, you are a placental mammal, like most other lactal animals from shrews to whales. All eutherians are mammals, but not all mammals are eutherian. There are six major divisions in mammalia, only three of which still exist; those that hatch out of eggs like reptiles (monotremes), marsupials, that are born in the fetal stage and complete their development inside the mother's pouch, and those that developed in a shell-like placenta and were born in the infant stage, as you were. Your own fetal development seems to reveal a similar track of development from a single cell to a tadpole-looking creature, then growing limbs and digits out of your finlike appendages, and finally outgrowing your own tail. Some would consider this an indication of ancestry. Especially since fetal snakes, for example, actually have legs, feet, and cute little toes, which are reabsorbed into the body before hatching, implying common descent. <br>  <br>  You are a primate.<br>  You have five fully-developed fingers and five fully-developed toes. Your toes are still prehensile and your hands can grasp with dexterity. You have only two lactal nipples and they are on your chest as opposed to your abdomen. These are pointless in males, which also have a pendulous penis and a well-developed ceacum or appendix, unlike all other mammals. Although your fangs are reduced in size, you do still have them along with some varied dentition indicative of primates exclusively. Your fur is thin and relatively sparse over most of your body. And your claws have been reduced to flat chitinous fingernails. Your fingers themselves have distinctive print patterns. You are also susceptible to AIDS and are mortally allergic to the toxin of the male funnel web spider of Australia (which is deadly to all primates, but only dangerous to primates, which is why you'd better beware of these spiders). And unlike all but one unrelated animal in all the world, your body cannot produce vitamin-C naturally and must have it supplemented in your diet, just as all other primates do. Nearly every one of these individual traits are unique only to primates exclusively. There is almost no other organism on Earth that matches any one of these descriptions separately, but absolutely all of the lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, you, and I match all of them at once perfectly, implying common descent. <br>  <br>  You are an ape.<br>  Your tail is merely a stub of bones that don't even protrude outside the skin. Your dentition includes not only vestigial canines, but incisors, cuspids, bicuspids, and distinctive molars that come to five points interrupted by a "Y" shaped crevasse. This in addition to all of your other traits, like the dramatically increased range of motion in your shoulder, as well as a profound increase in cranial capacity and disposition toward a bipedal gait, indicates that you are not merely a vertebrate cranial chordate and a tetrapoidal placental mammalian primate, but you are more specifically an ape, and so was your mother before you. <br>  <br>  Genetic similarity confirms morphological similarity rather conclusively, just as Charles Darwin himself predicted more than 140 years ago. While he knew nothing of DNA of course, he postulated that inheritable units of information must be contributed by either parent. He rather accurately predicted the discovery of DNA by illustrating the need for it. Our 98.4% to 99.4% identical genetic similarity explains why you have such social, behavioral, sexual, developmental, intellectual, and physical resemblance to a bonobo chimpanzee. Similarities that are not shared with any other organism on the planet. Hence you are both different species of the same literal family. In every respect, you are nearly identical. You, sir, are an ape.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	totally agree|`|oY7alfTIaa	depends if you believe in a certain religion--- like Christianity: where Christians believe that God made man and woman and animals.

Experts are called so because they generally have years of experience working with the matter in question and have degrees and education which directly apply, in other words, they can back their opinion up with years of experience and research.<br>  <br>  The Bible has nothing to back it up, it posits a hypothesis in the form of the Gospels, but it has no research or empirical evidence to back it's story, it's alibi doesn't hold up.  If you state; "I drove to the store and bought some milk" as an alibi for your wherabouts in a court case, you have to back it up with the receipt, the camera footage from the store, or the testimony of the person who checked you out.<br>  <br>  Lee Strobal accepts the posits from the Gospels without any such evidence.  He acts as if the writers of the Gospel couldn't possibly have lied (perjured themselves).<br>  <br>  He doesn't confirm anything, his "case" amounts to saying "But the bible says.." Which isn't going to convince anyone who doesn't already believe the Bible.

Zionism is the international Jewish political movement that originally supported the reestablishment of a homeland for the Jewish People in Palestine, after two millennia of exile. The area is the Jewish Biblical homeland, called the Land of Israel (Hebrew: Eretz Yisra'el). Since the creation of Israel, the Zionist movement continues primarily as support for the modern state of Israel.[1]<br>  Zionism is largely based on strong historical ties and religious traditions linking the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, where the concept of Jewish nationhood first evolved somewhere between 1200 BCE and the late Second Temple era (i.e. up to 70 CE).[2][3] The modern movement was mainly founded by secular Jews, beginning largely as a response by European Jewry to antisemitism across Europe.[4] It is a branch of the broader phenomenon of modern nationalism.[5] Initially one of several Jewish political movements offering alternative responses to assimilation and the position of Jews in Europe, Zionism grew rapidly following knowledge of the Holocaust and became the dominant power among Jewish political movements.<br>  The political movement was formally established by the Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl in the late 19th century following the publication of "Der Judenstaat".[6] The movement seeks to encourage Jewish migration to the Promised Land and was eventually successful in establishing Israel in 1948, as the homeland for the Jewish people. Its proponents regard its aim as self-determination for the Jewish people.[7] The percentage of world Jewry living in Israel has steadily grown since the movement came into existence. Today more Jews live in Israel than in any other country. About 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel and a similar number live in the United States.|`|hEH9pWABaa	Zionism is a movement which calls for the unification of Jews around the world in the Land of Palestine.<br>  Had the Zionists been a little more friendly, us lebanese would've been alot more hospitable and accomodating to their Bullshit|`|AA10394102	I do.<br>  It's a political standing to be with Israel no matter what Israel decides to do.

It is called, "Conviction Without Compromise: Standing Strong in the Core Beliefs of the Christian Faith," by Norman Geisler and Ron Rhodes. Allow me to "BRIEFLY" pull some quotations from the book to help explain about what is meant by the Bible being taken "LITERALLY," but please consider finding the book and reading this ENTIRE book for yourself... it is EXTREMELY informative, well-written, and interesting.<br>  <br>  By the "literal" method is meant the historical-grammatical method of interpreting Scripture. This method can be understood by what it is and by what it is not.<br>  <br>  === The book then describes in detail what "literal" IS... literal, normal, historical, grammatical, contextual, and authorial.... TOO LONG to copy here, sorry... but just take the FIRST point ... "literal,"<br>  <br>  The word LITERAL as used in hermeneutics (the science of interpretation), comes from the Latin sensus literalis, meaning the literal sense of the text, as opposed to a non-literal or allegorical sense of it. It refers to the understanding of a text that any person of normal intelligence would understand without the help of any special keys or codes.<br>  <br>  === Next, the book covers what the Literal Method is NOT... and HERE is really some CRITICAL information which speaks to this question/issue.<br>  <br>  The literal method of interpretation does not mean that everything in the Bible is TRUE LITERALLY; rather, it means that everything is LITERALLY [in a literary sense] TRUE. Also, it does not mean that there are no figures of speech, such as metaphors and anthropomorphisms.<br>  <br>  When the Bible speaks of the eye, arms, or wings of God (Psalm 34:15; 91:4; Isaiah 51:9), such expressions should not be taken as true literally. God does not have these physical features because "God is Spirit" (John 4:24). When Jesus said, "I am the true vine" (John 15:1), the literal method of interpretation does not take this to mean He is a physical vine. What He said is literally true (namely, that believers derive their spiritual life from Him, the vine), but it is not true literally that Jesus is a physical vine.<br>  <br>  === Then, the chapter continues to discuss that the Literal Method does not eliminate the use of symbols, parables and allegories, or "spiritual applications." But here is a critical passage...<br>  <br>  The Reasons for the Literal Approach to Interpretation... There are many reasons for adopting a literal interpretation of Scripture: 1) It is the normal approach in all languages; 2) the greater part of the Bible makes sense when taken literally; 3) it will take the secondary meaning when demanded; 4) all secondary meanings actually depend on the literal meaning; 5) it is the only "sane and safe check on the imagination of man"; and 6) it is the only approach in line with the nature of inspiration.<br>  <br>  === Much more detail is then explained. Another good illustration of this idea is given further on in the chapter... <br>  <br>  For example, on reason the Mormons believe God the Father has a physical body is that Moses spoke to God "face to face" (Exodus 33:11). They reason that if God has a face, then He must have a physical body. Contrary to this view, the broader context of Scripture indicates that God is a spirit (John 4:24), and a spirit does not have flesh and bones (Like 24:39). Hence, it is incorrect to think of God as a physical being that has a literal face. In keeping with this, the Bible indicates that God should not be depicted by any likeness whatever (Exodus 20:40).<br>  <br>  In the Hebrew mind-set, "face-to-face" metaphorically means "directly" or "intimately." Moses did not see any physical part of God, such as a literal face, but rather entered into God's direct presence and spoke with Him in an intimate way. Even a blind person can speak "face to face" with someone else---that is, directly and personally, without ever actually seeing a face.<br>  <br>  === The chapter then concludes with the IMPORTANCE of the literal interpretation of Scripture:<br>  <br>  But without this method of interpreting Scripture, there would be no means of understanding the essential teachings about salvation that MUST be believed to be saved. The primary reason so many cults deny one or more of the essentials of the Christian Faith and end up embracing strange doctrines is that they do not use the historical-grammatical system of interpretation.<br>  <br>  === I HOPE that some of this makes SENSE to you as I have quoted from the book. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have a blessed day.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Abraham and Isaac prefigured God giving his only begotten son Jesus.Abraham had faith and even there was no resurrection hope at the time he proved his faith (Hebrews 11:17-19) By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up [his] only-begotten [son], 18?although it had been said to him: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.” 19?But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.<br>  <br>  God was not going to let him kill his son,because he was a faithful man.<br>  The Bible tells us that the parents are responsible for their children when you see children today who at 8 and 9 and 11 years old shoot and kill others we can see that they can do bad.For example one of the peoples God had aniahlated forever were the Canaanites.the land of Canaan became saturated with detestable practices of idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed. The Canaanite religion was extraordinarily base and degraded, their “sacred poles” evidently being phallic symbols, and many of the rites at their “high places” involving gross sexual excesses and depravity. (Ex 23:24; 34:12,?13; Nu 33:52; De 7:5) Incest, sodomy, and bestiality were part of ‘the way of the land of Canaan’ that made the land unclean and for which error it was due to “vomit its inhabitants out.” (Le 18:2-25) Magic, spellbinding, spiritism, and sacrifice of their children by fire were also among the Canaanites’ detestable practices.—De 18:9-12.Added to their other degrading practices was that of child sacrifice. According to Merrill F.?Unger: “Excavations in Palestine have uncovered piles of ashes and remains of infant skeletons in cemeteries around heathen altars, pointing to the widespread practice of this cruel abomination.” (Archaeology and the Old Testament, 1964, p. 279) Halley’s Bible Handbook (1964, p. 161) says: “Canaanites worshipped, by immoral indulgence, as a religious rite, in the presence of their gods; and then, by murdering their first-born children, as a sacrifice to these same gods. It seems that, in large measure, the land of Canaan had become a sort of Sodom and Gomorrah on a national scale.?.?.?. Did a civilization of such abominable filth and brutality have any right longer to exist? .?.?. Archaeologists who dig in the ruins of Canaanite cities wonder that God did not destroy them sooner than he did.”<br>  How could righteous people live in a degraded environment like that?|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Genesis....<br>  <br>  Abraham knew that either God would provide something to substitute Isaac or that God would resurrect Isaac from the dead...because Abraham believed the promise God made to him.<br>  <br>  Genesis 15:4-6<br>  Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir." He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be." Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.<br>  <br>  Genesis 22:8 (NIV)<br>   Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son."

I have been attending a good bible teaching church for about 12 years, I've been in bible study almost all that time.  Without bible study, it's impossible to understand how God would have us live.  A Christian needs to learn about Jesus and what He said, and what He asks of us.  It's not complicated, He said, love God and love each other.  It's not easy to love other people, for me anyway.  Being a Christian means you love the Lord, desire to spend time with Him (in church, learing the Word, singing praises, and in prayer with Him in private), and also putting His example into practice in your everyday life.<br>  <br>  Believing in Jesus is only the beginning of the Christian life.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	lemming, sheep......... take your pick|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It means to believe in the free gift of salvation given by Jesus Christ.

I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing" (John 18:20 (NKJ)). <br>  <br>  If trinity is confusing enough to be called a mystery, it cannot be from God. Because:<br>  "God is not a God of confusion."—1 Corinthians 14:33, Revised Standard Version (RS). <br>  <br>  There was no mystery in the message of Jesus (pbuh), nothing secret. Will you accept the priests' so called "mystery of trinity" and forget clear commandments of Jesus (pbuh)? <br>  <br>  Jesus (pbuh) clearly said:<br>  <br>  A) Mark 12:29: "the Lord our God, the lord is One". <br>  B) Metthew: 26:39: "He went a little farther and fell on His face and prayed" (Following Jesus (pbuh) way is following what he did). Jesus (pbuh) prayed to one God<br>  C) Matthew 4:10 "You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him only you shall serve" <br>  D) John 5:19: "Most truly I say to you, the son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative but only what he beholds the father doing."<br>  E) John 7:16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me <br>  F) Matthew 27:46:  "Eloi (Allah?) , Eloi, lama sabachthani?" -- which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" <br>  (G)Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  John 8:54<br>  <br>  <br>  The trinity is a doctrine from about the year 325 AD, It has its roots in polytheism, It is not in the bible unless you really, really stretch it to fit.

XIV, PAGE 299:<br>  The formulation "one God in three Persons" was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 4TH CENTURY. But it is precisely this formulation that first claimed to title "The Trinitarian Dogma. AMONG THE APOSTOLIC FATHERS, THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY APPROACHING SUCH A MENTALITY OR PERSPECTIVE. <br>  <br>  <br>  You should not accept the word “son” literally . Word "son" was used in bible for general human beings and other prophets also. "we all are the children of father in heavens" indicates that word "son" was used in different meaning of love and care.

"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus , Moses, Mohammad (peace be upon them), they all worshiped the same God, the God of Ibrahim (pbuh). All prophets taught "surrendering one's will to God" that is the meaning of word "Islam". JAMES 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims love Jesus (pbuh), they believe in his miraculous birth with the will of God without a father or sexual act (the way Adam was born without a mother and father), , they believe in miracles that Jesus (pbuh) performed with permission of God, muslims faith demands them to believe Jesus (pbuh) was a great prophet of God and belief in the original message of Jesus (pbuh) the massaya.<br>  <br>  There was just not one holy book sent by God on earth through His messengers. The last testiment "Quran" had to be there  from the same source, revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (pbuh), an illiterate person who didn't know how to read or write) some 600 years after Jesus (pbuh) corrects the errors that crept (knowingly or unknowingly) into the message that Jesus (pbuh) brought. Unlike Bible that was written after decades after Jesus by people who never met Jesus, this book was not preserved on paper or in one church but in hearts of thousands of muslims who memorised Quran word by word the way it was revealved. Quran should prove to be a very valuable asset to both Muslims and Christians. <br>  <br>  Quran: [4:171] O people of the scripture, do not transgress the limits of your religion, and do not say about GOD except the truth.

It's like taking a dump, it's a bodily function. What you can do is abstain from things such as porn (lust) while you do it.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Masturbation isn't a sin...|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Just listen to your prostate and when your my age, it'll say "thank you."|`|4fTiCNiKaa	First of all, masturbation will not truly relieve the sexual pressure that one may feel. It may for a short moment, but in the long run it only creates a deeper desire and capacity for sex, which will lead to more masturbation. If you let yourself become enslaved to a sexual high, you will find that you need to go to increasingly extreme acts to maintain the same degree of excitement. This creates a vicious circle, like the junkie who craves a "fix," but is only temporarily satisfied. The more he indulges in his dependency, the more ensnared by addiction he becomes. This is the nature of all sin. That is why Jesus declared that all who sin become a slave to sin (John 8:34). <br>  <br>  Furthermore, masturbation usually involves fantasy, visualization, and often pornography. The Bible is very clear as to what God expects of us in these areas of fantasy and lust. It teaches that we must not look lustfully at each other nor should we behave in such a manner as to entice others to lust after us. <br>  <br>  All sexual immorality begins with a thought. A lustful thought not taken captive, will eventually lead to other perversions, because sin reproduces itself in increasingly greater measures. If we do not deal with our evil thoughts, they will take root in our hearts.<br>  <br>  It is for this reason that God is so concerned with our thought life. Jesus came not only to deliver us from our "outward" sins, but also from wickedness that begins in the heart.<br>  <br>  Our loving God never demands from us what is impossible for us to do. We are so weak within ourselves that it may seem impossible, but He will equip us with His holy power to overcome any sin, if we ask in faith. <br>  <br>  Of course, sexual urges in and of themselves are not wicked. They are natural. God created us that way. He desires that we get optimum pleasure out of them by using them the way they were created to be used. However, many desires for physical gratification (whether it be food, sex, etc.) stem from a deeper need that is unfilled deep inside us. Gorging our flesh can never fill a hunger that grows out of our spirit. Only intimacy with God can fill the deepest needs inside of us. No other created thing has that power. <br>  <br>  God is no more unreasonable than any caring parent who lovingly disciplines their child. It is only because He knows what is best for us. He sees a mighty potential in each one of us that far supersedes our wildest dreams, and He loves us enough to do all He can to bring it to pass. <br>  <br>  This is the place where we need the empowerment of the Holy Spirit in our everyday lives. The Holy Spirit is not a vague "force," but the very power of God to comfort you and strengthen you against the sins that used to rule you before you were born again. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we have the very ability that Jesus had to resist temptation. He depended completely upon the Father and so must we. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  ~SFECU~<br>  pray4revival<br>  &<br>  praying4U|`|349974840c2ddf946cda1b9160ff2645aa	Matt 5:28-29 (NIV) [Jesus:] "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

It used to be that the world was black and white in that the distinction between good and evil was clear and sin was easily recognized. Greed, lust, envy, jealousy, hatred, false pride are all common temptations we face every day.  But, in today's world it is getting much easier to find clever ways to validate or whitewash our sins and claim they aren't really sins.  You will also find a whole army of Satan's minions lining up to support you in that effort. But remember, a whitewashed lie is still a lie.  And the lie being told today is the same as it was from the beginning.. "surely you will not die".  People even find ways to twist scripture as though they can play games with God's commandments while allowing themselves to be sold on the lie that their soul is still safe "surely you will not die". <br>  <br>  So, acknowledging the sins in our lives and taking the steps to repent from them is becoming more and more difficult. Remember, Jesus warned us that even the elect would stray in these perilous times.<br>  <br>  Knowing in your heart that your personal relationship with God is in danger is the first indication that something in your life isn't right.  Whatever that is, this is the time when you need to sit down in serious prayer with God and make a personal assessment of yourself.  Let God show you exactly what is coming between you and our Savior. Then call upon our Lord to give you the strength to put it out of your life and turn your life back over to God. <br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|SZTm6mwmaa	Adam , answer this question please .

I do not think that the understanding of being and nothingness (lack of being) is exclusive to some; but I do think that existentialism is very hard for people to grasp. <br>  <br>  I am afraid that your statement (or argument) is not really complete. I agree with your notion that good is being and evil is a lack of being where good should be; but you have not demonstrated this, you have merely stated it. In order for people who have not considered being and nothingness to understand what you mean; you must demonstrate it. That is what the great philosophers have done and that is what we all must do in order to communicate our ideas.|`|AA11984833	I don't quite agree with all you said.

I can't.  God bless and good luck.|`|E9chZY74aa	God did not create Evil.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Analogies are not evidence.  Try again.|`|oL6FUbshaa	What is evil?<br>  <br>  The word evil has more than one definition. One type of evil has to do with sin. The other type of evil has to do with calamity.<br>  <br>  So, is sin God's creation? Well, if God is the maker of gold, does that mean that golden idols are God's creation? If God is the maker of beautiful women, does that mean that pornographic magazines are God's creation? If God is the maker of gravity, does that mean that suicide is God's creation?<br>  <br>  Just because God created gravity, that doesn't mean it's His fault that people jump off buildings. When the Bible says that God is the creator of all things, it's not saying that God is the creator of golden idols. It's simply saying that God created the gold that the idol is made out of. But gold in and of itself is not a sin. It's the misuse of the gold that is sin.<br>  <br>  Sin isn't God's creation. It's the misuse and abuse of His creation.<br>  <br>  So it's true that God is the creator of all things, but technically speaking He is not the creator of all things. He's just the creator of the materials that all things are made out of.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between just speaking plain english and getting all technical about it. So stop misinterpreting the scriptures by taking them out of context.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, when it comes to the evil of calamity. Yes, God creates calamity. God created calamity for Sodom and Gommorah when He rained fire and brimstone upon them. He created calamity for Egypt when he sent those 10 plagues against them.<br>  <br>  God does not commit evil. But rather He creates evil for the purpose of punishing those who commit evil, which is the very thing that makes him a righteous judge.|`|AA10578359	Did God create angels?

We are all connected spiritually together, every living being that has consciousness. We are all one. God ( which is our collective consciousness) created polarity. In order for God to know itself it has to know what it is not, therefore our concept of evil has evolved through social circumstances over many years.

pRF5LLloaa	The necessity to sacrifice ANYTHING went away with the New Testament.  Jesus was the last and most perfect sacrifice, made by God, on behalf of mankind.<br>  <br>  The bible is clear: Animal sacrifice  was a ritual designed to HIDE the sins of mankind.  it was an imperfect sacrifice offered by imperfect humans.  But the blood of an animal is insufficient to FORGIVE that sin.  Only a perfect sacrifice could do that, and Jesus was the only perfect man, capable of becoming that sacrifice that FORGIVES sin instead of just covering it up. And that perfect sacrifice could have been performed only by someone who is himself perfect -- God himself.<br>  <br>  Once that sacrifice has been offered, there is no other sacrifice that can do the job, so no sacrifice, animal nor human, is sufficient or necessary.  So the ritual of sacrifices stopped when Jesus died.<br>  <br>  No, Christians DO NOT believe in animal or human sacrifice.|`|GFEWLxeiaa	Clearly you don't understand the significance of the animal sacrifice as practiced in the Old Testament by the Jewish priesthood.  Animal sacrifice was done away with; it's no longer practiced in the New Testament.  When the New Law was established Jesus gave his life on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice; thereby negating the need for animal sacrifice.  Jesus died once, for all men.  That made it no longer necessary to perform the blood sacrifice yearly . <br>  <br>  To answer your question:  God has the utmost respect for human life.  He would never approve of the sacrifice of slaves like the Mayans practiced.  Just because that's what the Mayans practiced doesn't mean God approved of it.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Only God can take human life, so human sacrifice is expressly forbidden as an "abomination" in the Law of Moses. you must have missed that one (the one notable exception is capitol punishment for certain crimes, but that is punishment, not sacrifice).<br>  <br>  Jesus died for our sins, sacrificed by God himself, so no more sacrifice is necessary any way.|`|OLiH8pSvaa	I've never sacrificed an animal.

It was a harsh but effective punishment.  Unlike other religions, sacrifice wasn't completely about appeasement of a god.  It was a punishment for breaking the laws.  There's way more to it, but I really don't have time to list off the verses of the OT, compare them to the NT, and then explain the significance of sacrifices, sin, the holy spirit, etc.  <br>  In short, any sane Christian who understands scripture will not condone animal sacrifice.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Not anymore we don't.

"Jesus Christ" is a pretty well-known figure (not saying he was real or not, and certainly whether or not he was really a messiah -- but the story is well known), and they use that as simply a marker in time.

Even non-believers generally use B.C. and A.D. in books for American and European audiences because that's the system used here, not because they are endorsing the idea that Jesus was historically real.

Here is the answer from all that i have been taught.  Jesus was a real person and so many history books record his miracles and life.  Christs birth was a HUGE earth changing event everyone knew about. Even though jesus had not been born it was still written of the "CHRIST"/messiah that would come.  <br>    In the days before Christs birth the bible calls that Old testament times.  Its where people lived according to tradition and LAW.  Most were believers even the nations with other gods because GOD was physically present.  He did miracle after miracle like the sun standing still for 3 days, parting bodies of water, shooting down fire from heaven.   Long story short people feared god because he JUDGED sin because jesus had not come yet and payed the price. <br>    Now pretty much all people knew of ISREAL'S god, so they all wrote B.C. before the birth of christ. Now as the Birth happened and he died that time was A.D (after the death).  The reason u see it in so many books is this. After christ died he promised the holy spirit.  Jesus when he was alive could only be in one place at a time, but with the holy spirit the spirit of god is in us. Thats how we are able to pray n pretty much call out to jesus anytime we want.  So what happened is they got filled with the holy spirit and built the church, the church and the gospel spread and it is written they " TURNED THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN"  Thousands were saved everyday and pretty much the world all came back to Holiness and a fear of god. ONce again Gods spirit and exsistence was AMONG them with miracles and signs of judgement for those who sinned.  <br>    Everyone was a believer pretty much and the church had absolute rule.  The bible was truth and their was no other way. The church at one time was church n state, meaning they RULED, the bible was the government and JUDGE.  As in america our forefathers built this country on biblical principals and came here so they could build a place to worship god.  Thats why we have personal rights, liberties, freedom of religion,  and in court u swear upon the holy bible.  Morals and family values have only shot down in the last 60 years,  think of ur grandparents and how most are all about church, all about family values, especially with clothing and talk about sex.  <br>      SO all the people in our grand parents days were of religion and morals.  So all of society was the same along with the authors. Webster that wrote the dictionary wrote it because god told him to. All the authors who carried that belief of god wrote A.D, because it was the time they lived in and they believed.  *Well theirs your answer a little long yes but in detail to understand it in context of the times*|`|nANyAvzgaa	B.C.  - also means before common era|`|rAmhfdqkaa	drink!!!|`|yp8y1jrCaa	This link gives alot of information on time periods in history, and the way they're utilized. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Christ" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Chri...</a><br>  <br>  A.D.

In regions where Christianity was the dominant religion, the [real or fictional] approximation of Jesus' birth became the start of the Christian Calendar.  Thus, the BC and AD terms were natural.<br>  <br>  However, contemporary scholars, in realizing the Christianity is not the only religion in the world, and that the dates and facts of Jesus might be fictional, have changed the terms to:<br>  BCE  (before common era)<br>  and<br>  CE (common era)<br>  <br>  You are assuming that history, "should only have facts..."  History is part of human culture, and always reflects the biases of the people who write history.  The process of removing bias, and inaccuracies, is a never-ending process.  Removing AD and BC from the lexicon is indeed part of the process.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	B.C.: Before Christ.<br>  A.D.: Anno Domini (Latin: Year of the Lord).<br>  <br>  These terms are used because the overwhelming force in Western Civilization for the past 1700 years or so has been Christianity, and for a good 1200 of those, it was specifically Roman Catholicism.<br>  <br>  As such, a good many primary sources (sources written by first hand witnesses as well as artifacts from events) used these terms.<br>  <br>  Consider it a social convention, nothing more -- much like you say "bless you" when someone sneezes even though there hasn't been a bubonic plague epidemic in rather some time.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	No one with a brain seriously questions whether Jesus existed.  There was a Roman historian named Josephus who documented Jesus.  People can question his divinity, but the fact that he lived is really not in question.  The reason history uses B.C. to mark time is that whether you believe in Jesus as a religious figure or not, the fact that Christianity has been a major force in shaping our culture is indisputable and from that point of view it is historically significant, whether you believe in Jesus or not.|`|kDnN2AoNaa	well that is basically what it means...I mean yeah I cannot deny the existence of Jesus but I cannot say that he was THE god...yeah he did exist as a great prophet nothing more nothing less...he gave people hope of a better future giving them the opportunity to have a life without sins...|`|IyqyJ82Eaa	Its called the Gregorian Calendar.

To date something in the past, you would have to know each of the kings and how long they reigned.  (For things during the Roman Era, you could use AUC  (ab urbe condita = from the founding of Rome).  But, even Rome fell.<br>  <br>  Monks and historians not long after the fall of Rome, got tired off having to know numerous kings and Caesars and their reigns in order to date things.  IF ONLY they had a king who would reign forever, THEN dating would be simple!!!  Jesus' as the eternal king was the obvious answer and the source of a simple standard for chronology.  Hence the AD (in the year of our LORD) / BC (Before Christ) system.  Nowadays, for those who are offended, the PC approach is to use CE and BCE  (CE = common era).<br>  <br>  At the time the standard was put in place, there was little doubt about Jesus' existence.

AA11047076	The others have given you specific prophecies that Jesus failed to fulfill and links to some great sites- just a few comments on the so called fulfillment of the prophecies posted by "bride of sukkels" aka as duplicate account of sukkels<br>  <br>  "The Sanhedrin will be re-established (Isaiah 1:26)<br>  It was by Christ and His decipels."<br>  No- the Sanhedrin were the Pharisees that the Christian scriptures spend so mmuch time lying about and trying to malign.  Jesus and his disciples were never even Judges let alone Judges n the Sanhedrin.  PLus- awfully difficult to re-establish something that is already there!<br>  <br>  "* Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance. (Isaiah 2:4)<br>  #That is true to this day. From the Roman empire to the USA."<br>  Wrong- Christianity does not rule the world- in fact we live in a world where the bulk of countries have laws specifically separating the powers of Church and State- and in fact the majority of countries where there is theological rule are Islamic- the one exception being Vatican State<br>  <br>  "* The whole world will worship the One God of Israel (Isaiah 2:17)<br>  #Again, true. The whole world does worship the God of Israel. Not everyone does however."<br>  It does but people don't?  You always speak in opposites?  As for the whole world worshipping G-d: theres Hindus, Shinotoists, Atheists, various Pagan paths etc.  the whole world is very far from worshipping G-d!<br>  <br>  "* He will be descended from King David (Isaiah 11:1) via King Solomon (1 Chron. 22:8-10)<br>  #Yup and yes."<br>  Nope- if G-d is his father by definition he is not  a member of any tribe.  Feel free to try and find anywhere in Jewish law that an adopted child becomes part of the tribe of the adopted father.<br>  <br>  "* The Moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with "fear of God" (Isaiah 11:2)<br>  #That describes Jesus to the letter."<br>  No, the Christina scriptures give an explicit description of him breaking the laws of Shabbos by telling his followers to pick barley on Shabbos.  On top of that he failed to perform the mitzvah of p'ru u'revu<br>  <br>  "*****In other words - this must all be accomplished in a human lifetime*****<br>  #It was accomplished by Jesus in the period of His lifetime."<br>  Nothing was accomplished by Jesus except to die in a painful and gruesome way at the hand sof the Romans<br>  <br>  "* Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)<br>  #That's right. No evil and no tyranny will He not right on judgment day."<br>  Plenty of evil and tyranny in the world- judgement day happens when the Messiah is alive- not when he is dead!<br>  <br>  "* Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9)<br>  #Absolutely. The world is filled with the knowledge of God, but not everyone accepts it. But they Know who He is."<br>  Rubbish- Hindus, Shintoists, Animists, Pagans, Atheists etc all reject G-d.  Knowledge of G-d means ACCEPTANCE of G-d, not just knowing that a word exists!<br>  <br>  "* He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10)<br>  #UH,,,, Yeah! There are Christian Arabs all the way to Christian Zulus. A-Z"<br>  Rubbish- Hindus, Shintoists, Animists, Pagans, Atheists etc all reject Jesus- as do the Jews.  <br>  <br>  "* All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)<br>  #Yup again. Israel was re-established as a nation in 1948 and 10's of thousands of Jews continue to migrate there each year. ."<br>  At the time of Jesus the majority of Jews lived outside of Israel- he did not gathe rthem up.  The Jews are all meant to return to Israel during the lifetime of the Messiah- if he dies, he is not the Messiah!<br>  <br>  "* Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8)<br>  #Yup again. If you believe in Jesus, you will never die. Eternal life is yours."<br>  Pity for you that the prophecies refers to the resurrection of the dead on THIS WORLD.  Nice try at reinterpretation to explain his failures though,<br>  <br>  "* There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)<br>  #When Jesus returns as He promised, these things will be fulfilled."<br>  The Mashiach does everything in ONE lifetime.  There is no support in the Tanakh anywhere that the Mashiach dies beforw he fulfills what he is supposed to do.  A second coming is something inserted by Christian scriptures to make an excuse for Jesus not fulfilling the necessary prophecies.<br>  <br>  "* All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)<br>  #Ditto. Promised again."<br>  The Mashiach does everything in ONE lifetime.  There is no support in the Tanakh anywhere that the Mashiach dies beforw he fulfills what he is supposed to do.  A second coming is something inserted by Christian scriptures to make an excuse for Jesus not fulfilling the necessary prophecies.<br>  <br>  "* The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)<br>  #Yes they will, when their knee bends and their lips say Jesus is Lord."<br>  The Mashiach does everything in ONE lifetime.

It is also important to note that none of these prophecies include anything about a "second" coming.<br>  <br>  Here are some translation differences:<br>  <br>  Psalm 22:17: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"<br>  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."<br>  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."<br>  <br>  The term mashiach literally means anointed one and refers to the practice of anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The word does not mean savior.

And all the people shall say, Amen." <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  (Isaiah 43:11-13) - "I, even I, am the Lord, and beside me there is no deliverer.

No (I'm in NYC ;))<br>  <br>  -Establish a Torah based government in Israel (Is: 2,2-4; 11)<br>  *Israel is a democracy, not a theocracy.<br>  <br>  - Rebuild the third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28)<br>  *Is the third temple rebuilt?

Tell her that Jesus will forgive her for every sin she ever did.  Tell her that Jesus promises eternal life.  If everything goes wrong just mention Jesus in there somewhere and be yourself.  If I were you I would ask her if she wants to accept Jesus.  I would say something like now would be a good time for you to accept Jesus and ask Him to come into your heart.  Do it in a sisterly way.
GUHxmDxMaa	definitely adds a new angle to the definition of space junk.|`|758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	There is no life beyond earth.<br>  The "Abrahamic texts", teach us that earth is at the centre of God's creation, and mankind has a unique place in creation.<br>  <br>  The notion of inteligent alien life makes a nonsense of the Gospel. Adam and Eve's sin brought death into the universe - the whole of creation is now 'groaning' under the curse. <br>  If there was other life then why should they be effected by Adam and Eve? We of course are, since we are descended from them. Further, we can be saved by accepting Jesus's sacrifice only because he was human and has paid the death penalty due to all humans.<br>  Jesus' death could not save aliens.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, those that understand the "Abrahamic texts", as you call them, understand that there is no point taking them beyond earth because there is noone there.|`|e6brEEbOaa	I think you think too much of our capabilities, I think it far more likely that man will destroy the earth, far before we find intelligent life on other planets.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	I really, really hope not.<br>  <br>  Read The Streets of Ashkelon<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets_of_Ashkelon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets...</a>|`|nRszNpotaa	I would hope by that time we would have long stopped bothering with such silliness.

21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Gardner claimed he was revealing an ancient religion.  However, there continues to be no evidence that such a religion ever existed, and we know some of his source material (such as the work of Margaret Murray) was faulty sometimes to the point of invention.  Gardner drew on a great many different influences, but what he created from it aall was quite modern and unique, which is why he is commonly called tthe founder of Wicca.  People who continue to claim that Wicca is ancient have zero idea about religious history as well as about the decades of research that have gone into this specific topic.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in the history of Wicca, I strongly suggest Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton.  It is a very thorough survey of Gardner's influences and sources.<br>  <br>  Ravenwolf publishes for attention and money.  Her knowledge of history is awful, of Wicca mediocre, and her ethics are abhorrent.  She teaches teens to lie to their parents and turns Christians into evil boogeymen.<br>  <br>  More thought here:  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net/ravenwolf.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net/ravenwolf.shtm...</a>|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: that's debatable. Gardner claimed to bring it to the public eye, critics say he mixed ceremonial magic, pagan theories from Margaret Murray and invented Wicca.

Her research s*cks, her paranoia streak is a mile wide, she gives bad advice and is out for money - anyone who puts out "love spells", "prosperity spells" and "teen witch kits" is only looking for money.  The problem is several of her books are decent on the first read unless you're experienced enough to spot the errors and miserable research in them.  <br>  <br>  I seriously wish I could get my money back from her Halloween book, I bought it used for $2.99.<br>  <br>  Also use caution with DJ Conway, her "Celtic Magic" and "Norse Magic" books are only good for kindling a fire and I NEVER say that about books.

There are two main factors that are influencing this. It is true that many jobs are being taken by people from overseas. A lot of the businesses in Tenerife are catering for tourists; these therefore are dominated by English, Italian or Germans. In many cases they only employ workers of their own nationalities to fill seasonal job placements.<br>  <br>  The other factor is the current economic recession the world is facing. It’s hard not to notice how hard this is hitting the tourism industry in the south. You can see it on the street, when I’m driving to work many bars are empty and many are closed. Its scary, just walking around, the number of houses and apartments up for sale or rent is incredible. You can tell there is less work down in tourist land because the waiters aren't having their after work drinks in the bars. There is just very little money around and sadly, it's getting worse. By the time we get into April it is going to be desperate. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are not too many changes, but you made some mistakes that I fixed. <br>  <br>  Now here is the translated version: <br>  <br>  Desempleo de Tenerife, habitantes casi se ha duplicado en el último a?o.

sjMIFH9Faa	I don’t know if I would qualify salvation in the Catholic Church as “narrow,” but I will be honest in that I’m not sure what you mean by that. To me, the major difference in salvation between the two faiths is that in Catholicism, we consider salvation to be a life long quest as opposed to a single conversion experience. Now this quest isn’t the same for everyone and I believe God calls us towards different paths, but we are all called to rise above our simple mortality and take a seat at the Last Supper of Christ. <br>  <br>  Nobody can tell you what’s right for you, you must make that judgement for yourself. I can only tell you to learn as much as you can, and walk your path with a clean conscience. You might want to attend s few Masses and get involved with a RCIA program, you will not be pressured to do anything against your own conscience.  <br>  <br>  No matter what you choose, I think God gave us a critical mind so that we may challenge and explore our faith. I think learning more about he world around us is giving glory to God’s creation and that is exactly what you are doing. I know it’s easy to look at a situation like this as a crisis, but look at as a path towards greater understanding. As a Catholic, I am both flattered and inspired by your interest in the faith that I love so much. Even if you decide Catholicism isn’t right for you, I’m sure you will develop a greater respect for my Catholic brothers and sisters, and that is more than anyone could ask.  Dominus tecum.|`|AA11521494	Catholicism is far more structured, has a lot more required beliefs which may not be questioned, and believes some things that are not based on the bible as it places a lot of weight on church tradition as well.  I think the big question is whether you believe all the extra things that catholics have to believe (the catholic church is the only true church and there is no salvation outside it, the bread and wine really change into body and blood, the clergy structure of bishops, priests and deacons is the only possible one, if you do not attend mass every week you are in trouble with god etc).  The catechism that sets it all out is a very big book!|`|FgRUdQOBaa	I am glad you are asking for opinions because a great many people will give you just that, their opinion and state it as if it were fact.<br>  God bless you  for questioning your faith, any faith, only through sincere questioning and discerment can you find the truth. <br>  As for me, I believe what the Bible says in Matthew "you are my rock (petra) and upon this rock I will build My church and not even the gates of hell shall prevail"<br>  That makes Peter the first Pope in an unbroken line of Popes to the current one. <br>  Also at the last supper when Jesus says "this is my body" and "this is my blood" and tells us to do the same in his memory, I believe the Eucharist through the miracle of Jesus truly is just exactly what He tells us it is, His sacred body and blood. <br>  Thanks for asking.|`|HMteUyRdaa	There are many dogmatic differences between the Baptists and the Catholics. I have to tell you that only you can decide what is best for you. I am a Catholic and I would love you to join the family. We have such beauty in our Church and faith. Don't go by the answers you receive here because particularly on this forum there is so much hatred toward the Catholics and the bashing is constant that you will never really get a good answer and the Catholic ones are mixed in with these hateful ones. I suggest praying on the subject. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you to the Truth and the faith of Christ. Do your research on the faith, the roots of both Baptist and Catholic, and if you can honestly say you believe all of the Catholic faith then convert, if you cannot then continue to pray and to search. Eventually the Truth will set you free.<br>  <br>  RCIA classes talked about by the first answerer is a good idea with no obligation, try it out.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Go find a Catholic priest and talk to him. You won't regret it.<br>  <br>  Feel free to message me with questions :)|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	I would recommend that you contact your nearest Catholic Church and ask them when the next R.C.I.A. (Rites of Christian Initiation for Adults) class is.  This class will take about a year and will cover all of the major teachings of Roman Catholicism and delve into some of the more subtle teachings.  It is not an obligation to formally convert, so you could go and take the course and if you don't feel comfortable converting by the time the class finishes, just don't go through with the rites themselves.  No one will think the lesser of you -- and they will likely be pleased to have your voice join the class and help you learn about Catholicism.|`|53508c26f5cd4045c5bf39c8169c3ffcaa	I am non denominational myself . I think that too much emphesis is on the name over the door and not enough on who's house it is.<br>  Catholicism does have a beautiful emphesis on ritual and tradition. And this is all fien and good, just beware of it becoming lip service and going into auto pilot. that's the danger of repetitive ritual.<br>  Personally I could not join the Catholic church as I do not believe that praying to Mary is going to do any good. No matter HOW good she was, she is not God, and I cannot bring myself to equate her with Him.<br>  Best wishes & God Bless!|`|xZet9Dunaa	Talk to a Catholic priest first.

Or the pope claims is the authority on earth to change the word of God. As a baptist, you know better and were raised better.  Stick with what you are, baptist is a good choice.

With any luck she will feel the same and you two can discuss how to proceed. <br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>    *hugs*|`|sSEWJEECaa	Try flirting a bit. like  at first just small but then more and more and if she likes it or at least isn't freaked out us should ask her to come with you to the movies ( with some other mates too at first) and after a few times of doing those kinds of stuff in a group ask her out alone. Then when you get really close and stuff tell her how you feel.<br>  If you really like her ruining a friendship is the risk u gotta take come on if u want her there's no other way around :)|`|ZkOdsO1Maa	This is a hard question to answer because it all depends on how your friend reacts, she may like you as a friend and no more than that, the fact that she does that when she is drunk does not mean that she is gay or bi, people can act in ways that seem odd when drunk and regret it later, if your going to ask her do it when she is sober.<br>  <br>  One way to find out is  to nicely ask if she Fancy's you if she says no leave it there and say sorry for any embarrassment to her.<br>  <br>  Or do nothing, the choice is yours and no one can do  it for you.<br>  <br>  I hope it all goes well what ever you do|`|m66fhjMOaa	if you have kissed, she must like you.<br>  i've been in this situation, and it won't ruin your friendship unless something major happens: which if you like her that much, it won't.<br>  the best thing to do is talk to her about it: its the only way you will find out for sure if she likes you + then put your best foot forward.<br>  <br>  keeping her in your head + not having words with her is going to confuse you even more. just talk to her, its for the best. good luck!|`|aZpK4jn8aa	If I were you I would take it sllooooowwly with her and not jump the gun but you must tell her one day she may feel the same way, but if she doesn't then there is nothing more hurtful than unrequited love........<br>  ANYWAY I hope you the very best indeed.

zdu3gh8jaa	I find that once you start looking at the positives in your life, other things start to fall into place. Start by noticing the little positive things that happen each day - a smile from a stranger, a hug from a loved one, you didn't burn your breakfast toast, a cuddle from your dog/cat/budgie etc,  a hint of blue sky between the clouds, the enjoyment of a hot cup of tea/coffee or a bar of chocolate etc. These may sound silly, but when you start noticing the tiny positives you start to give out more positives - this in turn encourages more positive people and events to become part of your day to day life. Tell yourself each morning and night that you are entitled to have all the good things in your life, tell yourself that you are a beautiful and trusting person, who is kind, compassionate, thoughtful, loyal etc. Always use positives in relation to yourself, don't ever say things like ' I would look great if I lost another 20lbs or so' It should be 'I look and feel great inside and out and I feel happy, confident and secure in myself'. I'm not saying things will change over night, but keep it up (write little notes and stick them everywhere if necessary, all with positive reminders about you and your life) and slowly but surely you will see changes taking place.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a little and wish you all the best in your happy future.   :-)   -  see a smile from a stranger Lol|`|fqRBdOWLaa	Consider them all together, as a unique complex!<br>  <br>  1.

FLgE0xAJaa	The Book of Mormon is nothing but straight fiction, with no basis whatsoever in reality. Joseph Smith was a con man who was brought before the bar of justice in 1826 for engaging in a confidence scheme. He subsequently brought forth the Book of Mormon as another confidence scheme.<br>  <br>  Smith got his inspiration for the Book of Mormon from Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews: Or the Tribes of Israel in America, which was published in 1825 in Poultney, Vt, when Oliver Cowdery (who subsequently became one of Joseph Smith's scribes) was living there. Many of Ethan Smith's speculations about the ancient Americans are reflected in the Book of Mormon, including the basic story line of the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  In his book, Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon, David Persuitte provides an extensive listing of parallels between the two books, showing that the Book of Mormon was a product of the early 19th century.<br>  <br>  On top of that, there has not been found one single piece of archaeological evidence to convincingly support the story of ancient America found in the Book of Mormon. In fact, in the 1950s, the LDS church financed "the largest and most ambitious archaeological project ever funded by a religious institution" in an attempt to uncover evidence for the Book of Mormon. It was successful in that it uncovered an enormous amount of archaeological information about ancient America, but as far as providing any evidence for the Book of Mormon, it was a dismal failure. That has not been changed by any subsequent archaeological findings.<br>  <br>  In addition, in his book, Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church, Simon G. Southerton shows that the American natives show no evidence of Israelite descent, which contradicts what the Book of Mormon says.|`|WyICbuPqaa	In the book "People of the Serpent; Life and Adventure Among the Mayas", Edward Herbert Thompson tells of a family that came from the sea and brought civilization to the Mayan people.  They quickly became rulers of the Maya.  The family split in two, creating two nations; the builders, and the rubber people.  This is substantially the story of Lehi and his two sons, Laman and Nephi.  It is also interesting to note that subsequent kings were also named "Laman" or "Nephi" out of respect for the first kings.  The Mayans have a similar tradition with "Tupac".  Each new king was named "Tupac".  More recently, another team of archaeologists,  David Freidel and Linda Schele traced the genealogy of the Lacondan Maya to a man named Jawbone who came across the ocean ("The Untold Story of the Ancient Maya").  "Jawbone" is of course the literal interpretation of "Lehi".  Lehi is the prophet who brought his family across the ocean.  A stella showing the arrival of a bearded man in Mediterranean attire can be found at La Venta. (Stela 3)  In the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, there is a tapestry which depicts people coming out of a cave, following a man who is holding a round object.  The object is called a Giron-Gagal, which can be interpreted as compass or director.  The tapestry further depicts these people moving from place to place, always following the man with the round object.  This sounds very much like the story of the Liahona in the Book of Mormon.  Liahona also translates to compass or director.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm surprised that archaeology can provide this degree of corroboration to a civilization that disappeared more than 1400 years ago.|`|bc6MlMyoaa	No more or less so than the bible is.  Why is there no evidence for the existence of those two groups of people?  Probably because both books are works of fiction.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	to say there is "NO" archeological evidence is absolutely not true. <br>  <br>  there is a Cave of "Lehi" and the legend of a prophet named lehi in the middle east<br>  thats just for starters.<br>  <br>  as for "MY" most current "possible" archeological proof  see the link of greg brayden interveiw below. there are several others. <br>  <br>  and as for a literal historical book! its an abridged historical book. and it was the 2nd attempt to be translated by the power of God.<br>  <br>  there is also "forbidden" archeology that may or may not prove or disprove. Check out the magazine (ancientamerican.com) though much of the information in this mag does exist, it may or may not prove the nephites existed but it sure shows that people inhabited the land.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Many who don't like Mormons for whatever reason, make this claim, however, it is simply not true.  <br>  <br>  Part of the uphill battle in this area is that we are studying a lost people who's cities, records, languages, cultures, and history have largely been lost or purposefully destroyed.  Widespread looting of archeological sites has also contributed to the problem.  You'd be hard pressed to get a really good history of the Americas for the past 4000 years.  <br>  <br>  So, here are just a few things that offer supporting evidences to the Book of Mormon.  <br>  <br>  Many believe that the Jaredites were the Olmecs and the Nephites/Lamanites were the Maya.  Their time lines fit perfectly.  Additionally there is loads of supporting evidence to back it up.  The Book of Mormon went against contemporary knowledge when it was published 170 years ago.  Now, it is mostly in agreement with what scholars teach of the two civilizations.  Books have been written on the topic.  <br>  <br>  The book contains elaborate and perfect chiasmuses (ancient semitic contextual poetry).  Chiasmuses were only discovered after the printing of the Book of Mormon and the death of Joseph Smith.  <br>  <br>  There are significant hurdles to overcome in mesoamerican studies.  We still can't read Olmec.  While we can decipher Mayan writings, we have no idea how they were pronounced.  The largest city in Central America, El Mirador, has yet to be excavated.  Ancient libraries were burned by the conquistadors.  If we found a stone that said "This is the city of Zarahemla" we wouldn't know that it actually said that.  We would know that it said "This is the city of (symbol)."  We'd have no idea what the name was for that symbol.  King Pacal of Palenque wasn't in fact called Pacal by the Maya.  The name Pacal was given to him by modern researchers.  We do not actually know what his name was.  We call the mayan glyph for shield "pacal" and his glyph has a shield in it, hence, king pacal.  But that is the modern name given him, not the Mayan name.  For his name, all we have is the symbol.  <br>  <br>  Scholars are stumped at things like the Las Lunas stones found in New Mexico.  It's a copy of the 10 commandments engraved in stone....in HEBREW.  It's been authenticated and was created before the Spanish arrived.  About 30% of the words in many indian languages have hebrew roots of some sort.  Haplogroup X, a semitic DNA marker shows up in about 3% of native american populations.  <br>  <br>  The legend of a "fair skinned, bearded god" permeates the Americas and the south pacific.  This god supposedly healed the sick, instructed them to write, and promised he'd return.....just as the Book of Mormon recorded.   <br>  <br>  Joseph Smith was mocked for including accounts of buried cities (in earth and water), highways, stone boxes, cities, cement, etc.  Since that time, all have been discovered.  <br>  <br>  The "Title of the Lords of Totonicapan" records that their ancestors "came across the sea, were fair skinned, and were son's of Abraham".  <br>  <br>  The Chanes record a story of their forefathers that is identical to the tale of Nephi and Laman. <br>  <br>  Recently a place called Nahom was identified in Yemen.  This place was identified in the Book of Mormon when it was translated 170 years ago.  <br>  <br>  The Maya of 400 AD were warlike, canibalistic, and practiced wide-spread human sacrifice......just as the Book of Mormon describes the Lamanites of that time.  <br>  <br>  Tribes of Caucasian Indians have been found in Panama and other places.  Scholars have no explanation for how they came to exist in the Americas.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately the jungles tend to destroy and consume anything besides pottery and stone.  There is a lot we have to learn about the history of the Americas.  However, there are all kinds of things that support the historical nature of the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  While these things may give us additional insight and understanding, they are not the things that change hearts, minds, and lives.  We encourage everyone to read the Book and find out, from God directly, it it is true or if it is false. <br>  <br>  God bless.|`|UWKF7x4faa	It is the worst form of theological mythology.

AA11232725	Two things. The Bible says that God "formed" them from the dust of the ground. Scientists now know that the elements found in the ground are all present in the human body. God wasn't like some 5 year old kid making a "mud man". The same God who spoke the universe into existence cause the elements found in the earth to coalesce into a human body and then He animated it by His "breath".<br>  <br>  The second point is that Genesis is written in what is known as "accommodating language". People alive around 1500 BC would not have been able to understand anything about atoms and elements. God told the story to Moses in a way that would get the essentials across so that the people alive at that time could understand the basics. Namely, that there is a God who created them and who holds people responsible for what they do on the planet that He formed for them to live on, and that originally it was a "very good" creation until human beings disobeyed their Creator.<br>  <br>  As to humans evolving from apes, what does the fossil evidence show?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foolishfaith.com/book_chap3_apeman.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.foolishfaith.com/book_chap3_a...</a><br>  <br>  Chapter 3: <br>  Two Worldviews in Conflict<br>  What do thousands of scientists believe about creation and evolution? <br>  <br>  Ape-Man|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Because God said so<br>  <br>  Gen 2:7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>  <br>  Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	If you reduce a human being to nothing but a collection of the Elements of which he is composed, you will find that everything you discover is also found in the periodic table of elements, and, apart from certain gases, they are all found down in the ____________________.<br>  <br>  Fill in the missing word.<br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	The Bible and science both say dust.<br>  <br>  "Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground" -- Genesis 2:7<br>  <br>  "Those elements were ejected into space by the force of the massive explosion, where they mixed with other matter and formed new stars, some with planets such as earth.

The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; <br>  <br>   9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>   10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <br>  <br>   11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. <br>  <br>   12For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. <br>  <br>   13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <br>  <br>   14How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <br>  <br>   15And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! <br>  <br>   16But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

klQ48qVmaa	The concept of "Hell" was developed in the period after the Old Testament was written and before the New Testament was written.  The words "Hades" and "Gehenna" were used in the New Testament and are translated as "Hell" in English.  "Hades" came from the Greek concept of the Underworld where dead souls went to after death.  "Gehenna" was a place where refuse was burnt outside Jerusalem.  So "Gehenna" was the place of punishment after death.  There is no corresponding word in the Old Testament. <br>  <br>  In the Old Testament, the word used for "Hell"  is "Sheol" but this word is synonymous with the Greek word "Hades" or the place where dead souls go.  The place of punishment is "Gehenna" and the Greek counterpart is "Tartaros".  It is important to remember that souls are not punished in Hades or Sheol, but rather in Gehenna or Tartaros.  Unfortunately, the English language is not so refined and translates everything to "Hell".|`|F5NQqTwJaa	In ancient Babylonian and Assyrian beliefs the "nether world...is pictured as a place full or horrors, and is presided over by gods and demons of great strength and fiercelness". Early evidence of the fiery aspecto of Christendom's hell is found in the religion of ancient Egypt. Buddhism, which dates back to the 6th century B.C.E, in time came to feature both hot and cold hells.Depictions of hell portayed in Catholic churches in Italy have been traced to Etruscan roots. But the real roots of this God-dishonoring doctrine go much deeper. The fiendish concepts associated with hell of torment slander God and originate with the chief slanderer of God ( the Devil, which name means "Slanderer"), the one whom Jesus Christ called "the father of lie". John 8:44|`|8I9uduIiaa	In Judaism, we don't have a concept of 'hell'.<br>  <br>  To clarify: the OT is not a Jewish text. No Jews read nor study it.<br>  <br>  The OT is the Church-created, edited, alas often MIStranslated and misinterpreted version of the Jewish scriptures: the Tanakh.<br>  <br>  In Judaism, 'gehenna' refers to a real place.  It was a valley, outside Jerusalem, where a few Pagan or Mystery religions practised child sacrifice.<br>  <br>  'Sheol' means simply 'the grave'.<br>  <br>  The closest Judaism gets to 'hell' is a concept of purgatory; we believe the soul gets 'purified', and this can take up to one year. It's apparently not a pleasant process.....!<br>  <br>  But we have no 'hell'. We believe all humans are equally G-d's children.

Hell is not literal, it is not a place, it is absence from God, it is not existing, it is permanent death.  The Hebrews did not have a concept of this.  That is why you do not see it in their record.  Our modern version of "hell" as a place of torture forever is a man made concept that originated in the Hellenistic culture of Greece and was commonplace in Palestine during the New Testament period.

For example, there is no testable naturalistic model for the cause of the universe. In fact, the laws of physics demand that there is no way that we can interact with anything outside of our universe. Other areas that defy naturalistic explanation include the origin of life, the Cambrian explosion, and the origin of human consciousness. Progress is possible in these three areas, but it is unlikely that any naturalistic theory will fully explain key steps required for each process to proceed. It is my contention that none of these processes have a naturalistic origin, and, in fact, are logically impossible, given the laws of physics that operate in our universe. I believe that science will be able to completely rule out all naturalistic origin of life models at some time in the future.<br>  <br>  The Bible describes the creation of the universe, the earth, and life on it. The Bible also describes the laws that govern the universe and its ultimate fate.<br>  Creation of the entire physical universe (matter,1 energy,2 space3 and time4) from the invisible (16 x 109 years ago).5 This creation event includes an expanding universe,6 which continues to expand at this time.6 <br>  Preparation of planet earth for the creation of life. The Bible describes the Earth's initial conditions following its creation when the Sun is already shining. The Bible also says that the Earth is controlled by the heavens and not the other way around (geocentrism is refuted).7 The original Earth is described as being without any oceans or water at all (4.5 x 109 years ago).8 Science tells us that the Earth's water probably came from cometary collisions that were common during the early history of the Solar System.9 The main biblical creation account (Genesis 1) begins after the formation of the Earth's oceans with a description of the Earth as a water-covered planet covered by dense clouds (4.0 x 109 years ago).10 <br>  The dense atmosphere is partially cleared so that light can strike the surface of the earth. (3.9 x 109 years ago). <br>  Formation of a stable water cycle (3.9 x 109 years ago).11 <br>  Formation of continents, including an accurate description of the tectonic activity that produced the continents (2.7 x 109 years ago)12 <br>  Creation of plants on the land and their subsequent "production by the land," possibly including some naturalistic processes (0.9 x 109 years ago).13 <br>  Transformation of the atmosphere from translucent transparent as the Sun, Moon, and stars show through the atmosphere. (0.9-0.6 x 109 years ago) <br>  Creation of swarms of small sea animals and their subsequent "great increase" or "teeming by the water" (consistent with the Cambrian explosion) possibly involving some naturalistic processes. (0.5-0.3 x 109 years ago)14 <br>  Creation of birds (140-60 x 106 years ago)15 <br>  Creation of  sea mammals (60-50 x 106 years ago)16 <br>  Creation of land mammals that interact with humans (30-15 x 106 years ago)17 <br>  creeping land mammals (e.g., rodents) <br>  large quadraped land mammals (e.g., cattle) <br>  wild land mammals (e.g., carnivores) <br>  Creation of modern humans (100-50 x 103 years ago)18 <br>  The Bible is unique among ancient creation accounts in that its description of the order of creation is 100% accurate.|`|cdQryr7paa	Creationists believe that the universe and the human race were started by God waving his hand and inventing the Earth and a man and woman.<br>  Placing them in a beautiful garden (Garden of Eden) on the Earth.<br>  They believe that Adam and Eve had children and their children had children, and so on until they populated the entire planet.<br>  So, we are all the product of the incestuous relationships of Adam and Eve's children. <br>  All those brothers and sisters having babies together.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	That would depend upon the creationist. There is too much effort being put into lumping all creationists together and claiming they come from the same mold. This creationist believes (and knows in his own spirit) that God is the Creator who put us here after making "here".<br>  You can't say that all who believe in evolution are of the same mold, as well. Many, however, do rush into ill-conceived notions about how evolution disproves God. It does no such thing. The theory has failed to even prove itself. God claims to offer comfort to those who believe in Him in the form of the Holy Spirit. It is in spirit we find the greatest evidence of God and there is no empirical evidence to prove otherwise.|`|evStsOQiaa	God does what He does through His knowledge of advanced fields of science that are still unknown to the human race today. Why do you think humans say that if I were to go back in time to the stone age and show them what I can do today, such as the flashlight, gun, matchstick etc. they would think I was God? They would think that because of not understanding how they saw us do the things we did because of our advanced scientific knowledge over theirs. The same is true between ancient man and God.|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	Well, I believe that the universe did have a beginning, which seems to be indicated by the evidence supported by the Big Bang theory.  I do believe that it was God that created everything.  <br>  <br>  I do believe God is also the source of all life and all materials and immaterial things.  The Bible said that He created the universe and everything in it in 6 days.  Whether they are 24 hour days or not, I do not know.  But I do know that God is more than capable of doing it in 6 days, so that doesnt really matter.<br>  <br>  There is no solid evidence for macroevolution, but I do believe in mircoevolution, which is supported by a lot of evidence, such as the Finches and dogs and cats and even the human races.  <br>  <br>  The cell is structured in a way that it could not have evolved.  If it were broken down at all, it would not function.  This is one of the organs that Darwin talked about that could disprove his theory.  He stated that if there were an organ that could not have evolved (if it were broken down and could not function), this would really undermine his theory.  The cell, which Darwin didnt know all the details about then, fits that description.  <br>  <br>  There are also processes, like blood clotting, that could also not be broken down and still function.  This all points to a creator, because Someone or something had to put the cell together if it didnt magically do it on its own.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	Basically what they are saying is that "After billions of years anything could happen," is not science.The theory of intelligent design (ID) holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. ID is thus a scientific disagreement with the core claim of evolutionary theory that the apparent design of living systems is an illusion.<br>  <br>  In a broader sense, Intelligent Design is simply the science of design detection -- how to recognize patterns arranged by an intelligent cause for a purpose. Design detection is used in a number of scientific fields, including anthropology, forensic sciences that seek to explain the cause of events such as a death or fire, cryptanalysis and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). An inference that certain biological information may be the product of an intelligent cause can be tested or evaluated in the same manner as scientists daily test for design in other sciences.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the claim that the natural world can be explained as the result of only natural causes is not scientific. The idea that the natural world has no supernatural causes lies outside of science. It is metaphysical and cannot be verified by science.<br>  <br>  Edit: For what it is worth ... the Bible does not give an age for the earth. The 6,000 year old thing was an estimate of Dr. John Lightfoot, a 17th century Anglican clergyman. He estimated that creation occurred during 4004 BCE. Bishop James Ussher in the 17th century made the same estimate a decade later, and got almost all the credit.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Lots of truly strange things, like dinosaurs walking the earth with humans.<br>  <br>  Check out this lovely diorama (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creation_Museum_10.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creati...</a> ) in the Creation Museum (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/ars-takes-a-field-trip-the-creation-museum.ars" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/...</a> ) showing Eve sitting in a very sexy frock next to an over sized velociraptor.<br>  <br>  I also love the photo of a parent hoisting his child onto a saddled tricertops (<a href="http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/400/526893292_e95eb57c10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/...</a> ).|`|jOwH96wKaa	Basically that genesis is true, god created everything as is, and earth is only 6,000 years old.<br>  <br>  So, we also co-existed with dinosaurs, and evolution is a lie.|`|qRue8Xdraa	Too much to type.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Let me ask you a question: Do you think God can tell a lie? Of course not; it would be impossible for Him to speak falsely. God is absolutely pure and righteous, and (as the Bible says) "there is no wickedness in him" (Psalm 92:15).<br>  <br>  But this is what you are saying when you claim God doesn't love you! You see, time after time in the Bible God tells us that He loves us—and He can't tell a lie. He doesn't love our sin—but He does love us. The proof is that He sent His only Son into the world to take away our sins, and He did this by dying on the cross for us. Do you want to know if God loves you? Look at the cross, for it is the ultimate proof of God's love. The Bible says, "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).<br>  <br>  But let me ask you another question: Do you think your emotions can ever lie to you? Do you think they can persuade you to believe something that isn't really true? Of course they can; it happens all the time. So whom will you trust: God—or your emotions? Only God is worthy of our trust.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you grew up in a family that made you believe you weren't worth being loved, or there may be some other reason for your feelings. But don't trust those feelings! Instead, put your faith and trust in Christ, for His love for you is everlasting.|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	Of course he loves you!  He loves everyone equally.

It is like Rabbinic Judaism as opposed to Karaite Judaism, sort of.<br>  <br>  Paul of the NT writings is an example that forsook his "ancestral traditions" for the written Torah:<br>  <br>  Gal 1:13  For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure, and tried to destroy it;<br>  Gal 1:14  and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.<br>  <br>  <br>  The faith of Paul went back to the written Torah when quoting from Deuteronomy 30:14:<br>  <br>  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"-- that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,<br>  <br>  Deu 30:10  if you obey the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.<br>  Deu 30:11  "For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach.<br>  Deu 30:12  "It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'<br>  Deu 30:13  "Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'<br>  Deu 30:14  "But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may observe it.<br>  <br>  <br>  For instance, in the Written Torah the "stranger" among the children of Israel, including the Tribe of Judah,  was to "hear, learn, fear YHVH, and observe" ALL the words of the written Torah. There were no separate "Noahide laws" for the "righteous gentiles" as in Rabbinic Judaism:<br>  <br>  Gather together the people - the men, the women, and the small children, and your stranger who is in your cities - so that they will hear and so that they will learn, and they shall fear HASHEM, your God, and be careful to perform all the words of this Torah. -- Deuteronomy 13:12     The Stone Edition<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Christianity wants to abolish the Torah for the gentiles. Judaism creates different laws of the Torah for the gentiles. Both camps are more similar than they are different at their core.<br>  <br>  They both want to conceal the commandments within the written Torah of YHVH away from the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  Eccl 12:13  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	[edit]  To answer your question directly--it's because they're playing at being Jews, trying to fool themselves into believing that by following a few Jewish rituals they somehow give themselves the right to call themselves "Jews".<br>  <br>  Let me be really clear:  “Messianic Jews”, “Jews for Jesus”, etc., are **not** Jewish.  Period.  They are Christians, many of whom, under false pretenses, aggressively seek to convert Jews and descendants of intermarriage to Christianity in a way that many of us find invasive, disrespectful, and anti-Semitic.<br>  <br>  Please understand that this is not an anti-Christian stance. If your life has been enriched by accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior, we are truly happy for you. But people who call themselves Jews and then twist our traditions and teaching for their own purpose are found to be deeply repugnant<br>  <br>  Before I even get to what Jewish law says about these impostors, consider this:  not only does every Jewish organization completely reject them as Jewish, but so do a fair number of Christian groups (see links 2-4 below).<br>  If no Jew thinks that you’re Jewish, and even some Christians don’t, then how can you possibly think that you are?  And if one thinks that this rejection is a recent phenomenon, think again!  Even St. Ignatius, of the 2nd century, felt the same way!  In his Epistle to the Magnesians he wrote:<br>  <br>  “Never allow yourselves to be led astray by false teachings and antiquated and useless fables. Nothing of any use can be got from them. If we are still living in the practice of Judaism, it is an admission that we have failed to receive the gift of grace…To profess Jesus Christ while continuing to follow Jewish customs ***is an absurdity***…[L]et us learn to live like Christians. To profess any other name but that is to be lost to God…For where there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism.”<br>  <br>  And now for what **we** say:<br>  <br>  Most Jewish scholars agree that you cannot convert away from Judaism (there are a minority who say you can convert away). However, this by no means implies that a Jew who joins another religion has the same standing as a Jew who has remained Jewish. A Jew who practices another religion, whether it be Christianity (in any of its forms, including Messianic "Judaism"), Islam or anything else, is known as an "apostate." An apostate is someone who has removed themselves from the Jewish people by joining another faith. The apostate cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery. Nor can the apostate be counted for a minyan, the minimum of ten adult Jews (or adult Jewish men, depending on one's denomination) needed for saying certain prayers. For nearly all practical purposes, they have the same status in the Jewish community as non-Jews. The only difference is that they do not have to undergo a full conversion to rejoin the Jewish community, though there is a process known as "Teshuvah" that they must go through to come back to the Jewish community with full Jewish status.<br>  <br>  So, once we delve into Jewish law we see that a Jew who joins another religion, though still Jewish, has ostensibly the status of a non-Jew and is no longer able to participate as a full member of the Jewish community. The apostate has the weakest of all grasps to their Jewish identity, they are Jewish by birth but otherwise have no position in the Jewish community.<br>  <br>  This then brings us to a discussion on the difference between "doing Jewish" and "being Jewish." By "doing Jewish", I am referring to someone who is actually practicing Jewish beliefs and laws. By "being Jewish", I mean someone who has been born Jewish. Now, there are many people who are born Jewish but are not practicing Judaism. For instance, if a Jewish person murders a family, the Jewish person may be "born Jewish" but certainly was not "doing Jewish" as murder is a violation of the Ten Commandments. <br>  <br>  Similarly, we can see examples of this in the Jewish Bible. The prime example of this would be the Jews who worshipped the Golden Calf at Mount Sinai. These individuals were unquestionably Jewish by their birth, thus we can argue that they were "being Jewish." However, were they "doing Jewish?" The Bible is quite clear that these individuals, though born Jewish, were not practicing Judaism. The worship of the Golden Calf, though it was a monotheistic form of worship, was clearly a violation of the Biblical law regarding the making of idols. Thus, they were not "doing Jewish." Similarly, in the Prophets we see countless reprimands of people who were undeniably Jewish by birth, but had entered into apostasy by worshipping gods such as Baal and Ashtoret. They were not "doing Jewish" but "doing pagan" and had violated the very underpinning of Judaism. That they were "being Jewish" by their birth was clearly not sufficient. One must also "do Jewish" in their actions.<br>  <br>  Along the same lines, many of Jesus' original followers were unquestionably born Jewish. However, by adopting non-Jewish beliefs, such as thinking that Jesus was a god (a violation of several places in the Jewish Bible, Numbers 23:19 and Hoshea 11:9 provide a few examples of this), were no longer "doing Jewish." The same is true for individuals in the Messianic movement today. The Messianic movement was created by Christianity, and its beliefs and values reflect Christianity. By practicing Messianic "Judaism", the individual who was "born Jewish" is no longer "doing Jewish." They have removed themselves from the Jewish community by their practice and beliefs. Unfortunately, too few of these individuals have an understanding of the difference between "being Jewish" and "doing Jewish", mistakenly believing that they can both believe in Jesus and still have the same status in Jewish community as before. They not only have lost status, but also have lost the practice of Judaism. As has been pointed out in the Talmud, the emphasis for us is on the action, the "doing Jewish.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is taken from the reference section of the first link:<br>  <br>  1."There is virtual unanimity across all denominations (of Judaism) that Jews for Jesus are not Jewish." (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, pp. 139-140). <br>  2."For most American Jews, it is acceptable to blend some degree of foreign spiritual elements with Judaism. The one exception is Christianity, which is perceived to be incompatible with any form of Jewishness. Jews for Jesus and other Messianic Jewish groups are thus seen as antithetical to Judaism and are completely rejected by the majority of Jews". (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, p. 9). <br>  3.Jewish groups: <br>  o"To make the record clear, Jews for Jesus is a Christian missionary organization – period." (last link). <br>  o"Messianic Jewish organizations, such as Jews for Jesus, often refer to their faith as fulfilled Judaism, in that they believe Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. Although Messianic Judaism claims to be Jewish, and many adherents observe Jewish holidays, most Jews regard Messianic Judaism as deceptive at best, fraudulent at worst. They charge that Messianic Judaism is actually Christianity presenting itself as Judaism." (Balmer, Randall. Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Baylor University Press, Nov 2004, p. 448)|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi. I like to explain it like this. That group you mentioned is just pretending to be Jewish, and they're actually causing us much grief because of it and I think they do it purposely just to create ruckus and chaos and a fight  If people do that then nobody knows "who's who" in this world but they didn't take into account the next world to come.  So they think they can get away with it.  But their plan backfire on them sooner or later.<br>  <br>  They are totally conflicting with Judaism. It is better to be a righteous gentile and walk in the front door than to be a gentile trying to slip in the back or side door. We're watching all the doors and everyone is invited it's a great party in here I know!! So no need to try to crash into Judaism by a side or back door (it's just very sneaky and not very righteous.) We turn people away for trying to do that.<br>  <br>  It's much better to be a straight up Christian or a Noahide than it is to be a Messianic.

iYW2ZVuFaa	Yes, quite a long one. <br>  <br>  Generally adherents of Judaism (even among the ultra-Orthodox) have supported the right of the LGBT community to be treated fairly and accepted by mainstream society as equals rather than something to be quarantined (or worse). <br>  <br>  In the US and here in England, the history of Jewish support for gays goes right back to the 1930's a time when supporting gay rights was actually dangerous.

I am swung pretty far right on the religious spectrum.  But in my views on GLBT topic I'm actually quite liberal. I am from SF Bay Area growing up in the 60s exposed to diversity and have gone to GLBT support groups. I have learned to appreciate diversity and individuality and personal accomplishments that contribute to the whole. In short, I think scripture got a bit hijacked and society needs to correct itself and this group like every other group needs to allow for adjustment back on overcompensation when finally accepted by society. <br>  <br>  I watched the civil rights movement where we had women and blacks and asians and hispanics etc so I learned a larger perspective.  GLBT get a turn too!  I just think they got a bum rap like other groups. This isn't blanket authorization or open end ticket for any particular group I mentioned or didn't mention to do what they want, we still have rules. On issues pertaining to Jerusalem I am quite strict, for spiritual matters that are most dear to Judaism take priority and I cannot secede to any particular group otherwise that would be idolatry. Jerusalem is our Holiest city and I'm strict with everyone there, it's just part of my job. No bra burning, no parades, no chaos, no politics, nothing in Jerusalem except absolute respect, modesty and humility for the Holy City and our most pious Jews there who have held that city for millenium while G-d was watching over us all.  It's only then do I turn against any group, only when they force me to, and I defend with enough vociferousness that would make any GLBT or any other group blush with shame, as that is my duty.
