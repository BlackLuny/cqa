cFrtOg45aa	You notice the little things by being very observant.. You can do this by engaging someone in a conversation. Asking a lot of questions. Then closely listening to their answers. While they are talking you are perceptive and are keenly watching them. What to watch for would be what people say or don't say. Their mannerisms, body language, their manner of speech.The words they use to express ideas and thoughts.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Meditate and learn to be relaxed and free of misconceptions.  Also try to be accepting.  People who are not tied to preconceived notions and relaxed are free to experience what is available.    Read my blog on meditation http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-IeUS6eQye...|`|kQ2vj6RSaa	All you have to do is pay attention and focus in what you are watching. That's all.|`|Y4lA8S84aa	"JUST DANCE  GONNA BE OKAY !"|`|s89uFNyeaa	I think that you just have to have the trait of being very observant as well as have a good memory.     Try to look at your surroundings and maybe try to imagine what you see in pictures. Notice the details. For example, don't look at a person as just a person, but as a girl wearing a blue pea coat and black Jan-sport backpack. Be very specific. Don't see things as wholes, but as separate pieces all put together. Remember each piece.     People with photographic memories probably are the best at what you are trying to accomplish. There are probably other techniques to try, but this is what I see myself naturally doing.
s3IBrhZCaa	nah, it never bothered me when a woman would look at me sexily.    i wish they would drool over me. i wouldnt mind one bit.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Lol having women drool over our thingy is a awersome thing as it helps give us a self confidence boost|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I had a boyfriend once who said that as long as she didnt hurt him, he would like to be "raped" by a really good looking woman. And he meant being abducted and all, or dragged up an alleyway.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I agree with the guys.  A little nip never hurt anyone.  Everyone has them.|`|asYc2Khfaa	no. i do mind if staring is the only thing she wants and she's not coming to get me|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Men who say they would want women to stare at them, are only referring to women they are attracted to, whether they realize it or not.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	It's no 100% rule but girls are the opposite of guys. Girls don't stare at thingys. At least not obviously so that he knows it. If they did that it would be like, hey this is gonna be easy! :-)     The offensive thing girls do is to be overly coy and not direct enough. I remember in the gym and these 2 girls on the stairmaster were checking me out and excitedly whispering and giggling. Then they made sure to walk right by me afterwards but wouldn't make eye contact or say hi. I mean if you are checking me out at least have the decency to admit it.     And one other time a girl in a restaurant was checking me out by hiding her head behind the menu and peering over it and then ducking down to whisper something to the girl next to her. She kept doing it and I got pissed off so I moved. Again, if don't do something and then pretend like you're not doing it.    But here's what worked one time. A girl in a bar saw me and checked me out from another table. Then she got up and walked over and said "I never do this but..." and she sat down and before you knew it...:-)    So yeay, guys piss off girls by being too obvious. Girls piss off guys (like me anyway) by being to coy.|`|iddMxOroaa	You know what to tell you the truth I think women also stare but do so in a sneaky way so that the men don't even know that they're being sized up by the women, us men just stare blatantly but you women can do it in anyway that we don't even notice, so to answer your question I haven't come across girls who look at 'my thingy', lol!|`|BkleL3F4aa	I was at a party in a cotton shirt, one of the women there drew attention to my nipples being erect (they are actually pierced but she didn't know that) and she gave one a little tweak. It didn't bother me in the least. I never wear clothes that allow people to see my "thingy" but if i did no doubt they would stare but I would have chosen to wear those clothes in the first place same as I did my cotton shirt.|`|adryEZvTaa	LOL, oh goodness, I should be so lucky!  Are you kidding?  Any guy that says he feels uncomfortable if a woman, (especially if she is a hot woman) stares as his p***k, then he is either gay or he is a natural born liar.     Oh by the way, I liked your earlier question better:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|5k9NWD0aaa	Nope...I'm just like women in this way.  If I'm attracted to her...she's just confident and "knows what she wants."  I would probably go on over...  If she's below my standards, I would see it as "creepy" and either move elsewhere or socially castigate her in some way...|`|hR1wc0taaa	Women 'ogle' differently than men...they look you up and down, but take action much more swiftly once they've made themselves known.  it gets a bit uncomfortable when they attack, especially when they're the nice kind that seem to lose control and go on the attack.|`|wSjLVDteaa	thats one big difference between men and women    men are turned on by female perverts..... i would not mind her starring there constantly|`|IjSVNOZraa	Random story, one day during my high school government class (ew, very boring) I was totally zoning out. My friend whispered at me "dude, why are you staring at the teacher's crotch?". I didn't know I was zoning off in the direction that his crotch happened to be at....  it was still very awkward.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Nope, I welcome it with open arms and a forward pelvic pose.|`|3862H0WVaa	I'll admit the first time it happened I was a little shocked.  I was standing in a raised shop doorway and an older very attractive lady walk by. I had loose fitting jogging bottoms on and in retrospect they did show off my packet at bit.  As she walk by she turned and looked me in the eye then look at my packet and smiled the same way as i would when looking at an attractive women.  I was a little shocked at the time as I was quite young but I liked it.  I just wish I had been quicker of the mark as she was about 30 ish and lovely.
pzLDXL6gaa	Surprisingly, yes. It shocks me to be honest, I think it's just so risky. However I think they do work in the mean time, becase you can't really bum off your family now until you get married, but they only do small jobs and I'm sure they're planning for someone to take care of them. If it happens anyway that's fine but why just wait around for somebody to make you their housewife, and provide for you, and what happens if it goes wrong? Mostly I've seen it not intentionally, in girls who get accidentally pregnant at around 18-20 and then they just sort of fit into the SAHM thing.    Harriet|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Of course, it's only natural.    Now, seeing that the economy does not support men who can provide for the entire household so much anymore.  It takes a much better looking woman to land one of these men.  So, any that are genetically unfortunate (to look ugly) know that they will have to work for money.  Hot chicks have a choice between working and not having to work.  Trust me, ladies, the tred mill pays off.    Not to mention that raising children properly is one of the most important things anyone can do.  And according to our full prisons, people just aren't doing it right anymore.    Wise man once said, "Work to live, don't live to work."|`|3862H0WVaa	Only spoiled middle classed brats think ALL women want a career.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Yes, there are. If they end up never needing a career, then they're very lucky. It's too much of a risk not to have at least a college education.|`|DxohE884aa	Woah! Hard to imagine, nowadays. What if no one wanted to marry them?  I guess there are still people like that, but before the people who never had a career still were educated, they just couldn't really use it... if that makes sense...  I don't plan to, anyhow.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I don't see wow people act as if a woman can't have a career, and still be married and have kids.  Women have been doing it successfully for decades.  People act as if it's one or the other.    Maxi R: Actually, a spoiled-middle class brat would be LEAST LIKELY to want to have a career.  Why work if you're already spoiled...?    Danica: No, it's sad that people assume that all working mothers A: Can even AFFORD daycare and B: Value their careers over their children.  God FORBID I enjoy having a career and a family.  I simply can't love both, right?|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Motherhood is the most ancient career in the world. A career that I seriously love and enjoy. I know there are no monetary units in it, but the joy of watching your first baby take his/ her first steps is far worth more than $ and cents. I love taking care of my family.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	yes, absolutely.    and the ones who say "no"......you just wait and see. the minute they enter good ole' Corporate America.....they will be turned off right quick. They will plump up and waddle around pregnant......they will leave on pregnancy leave.....and they will never come back to the job.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Yeah...I think my sister. She's 34, married, and still going to school. Maybe one day she'll get her first career but I think what she really wants is to have kids instead.|`|e07f8c1e78556e477bf544de03c31b1aaa	I guess raising your own children and being there for them isn't considered a career these days but yet if the parents sent them off to daycare, that would be ok because the people who are watching them are getting paid.  It's sad how people don't consider raising a family a career.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	I feel so sad for those starry-eyed 18-yr-olds, who think they're going to raise adorable, perfect, beautifully-dressed babies and decorate pretty cottages while their handsome husbands (who do have degrees) work at well-paying jobs forever.  I feel sorry for the ones who think it's possible for their handsome husbands to earn enough to finance their credit card habits, the medical bills for the whole family, college educations for all of them, weddings for all of them, a big house, a vacation house, two fancy cars, nice vacations and a nice retirement without any input from them ever.  I wish them well.  No one ever becomes seriously ill, divorces or dies in their fairytale world.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Of course there are many women who don't want a career! Does everyone have to be the same these days or something??|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Only a stupid woman would do that.|`|NYU37jfGaa	There are a great many women who do not have careers, but just jobs.  Many of the women I know who have children and work are just trying to earn enough to supplement their husbands' incomes, or support the children or whatever, careers as such are not on their minds.    In the UK at any rate, there are still a great many people, male and female, who leave school without any idea of going to college or pursuing a career.  When I was young, it was quite normal for people of both sexes to leave school at 16 without even doing A levels (roughly the English equivalent of graduating high school).    If everyone was obsessed with having careers, there would be nobody to do those essential non-career jobs that keep society ticking over.  who would collect the garbage and clean the streets and serve you in shops and restaurants, and clean your hotel rooms and office blocks etc?  Who would look after the children of the people who are rushing off having their high-powered careers?  Somebody has got to do these things.    when I was young, enormous numbers of women went into non-career type jobs doing typing and secretarial work etc.  I suppose these jobs are mostly obsolete now, with computers etc, and I don't know if there are still office jobs for people who are not high-flying career women.  But I feel there must still be jobs for those who are not career-orientated.|`|wSjLVDteaa	a majority of them plan not having a career when theyre married    but in america and the UK i guess not|`|IjSVNOZraa	Yup, one of them used to come on here all the time... speaking of which... I miss you Proudy :(    Personally, I don't care what people do with their lives. I think it would be wise, however, to have a fall-back plan in case your hubby ever dies or if you ever get divorced for any reason. Getting a college degree wouldn't be too bad an idea in that case.|`|qkmsixWXaa	Oh  yes, most of my aunts never got a career to take care of their kids. And even now that their kids are full grown they count on the men to support them, some even treat them bad.|`|7qoyVAIjaa	Your question reveals your prejudice. Many women choose raising a family AS as career, not in lieu of one. And, yes, I know many. After their kids are grown they often take on a second career. The ladies I know who have chosen that course are very fulfilled and happy with their decision.  I feel so sad for babayaga who thinks that a happy, well provided for, one income family is a fairy tale. She needs to resort to rediculous hyperbole to make her case. Just sad...|`|UOz1LPIHaa	Yes, they do exist.  And they're not all bad people or even stupid or uneducated people.  Some people just want to be a full-time mom because that's what appeals to them.    I knew this girl (already married by the time we met) who wanted to have a few kids after finishing college and be a stay-at-home mom.  She's out there somewhere with a degree that could probably support an entire family if need be, but always made it clear that she wasn't really planning on using it.  It was just so she wasn't wishing she'd have done that 10+ years from now when she had these kids running around.  Bonus points for maybe being handy should something ever happen to her husband.|`|AA11966875	Yes, and there are many men who never plan on having careers too.      Or were you really saying that being a full time teacher, cook, housekeeper, psychiatrist, nurse, doctor, mediator, dietitian, office manager, volunteer, all combined into one is not a career?    A lot of women and men don't plan on that career either, but they get it anyway and then don't know how to handle it.
3xYS4f5Baa	It means that you really like the girl. You took her phone because you somehow figured that you would be able to get closer to her if you had it. When you got caught your sub-conscious then decided that another way to be with her would be if you made a lot of money. That is why she gave you the paper.|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	I think its ur future girlfriend and on the paper says: meet me in bed ^^|`|rfm4W1Bkaa	I think it means that you feel that your stealing from someone and they continue to be nice to you.

GWRP3vLQaa	A country who protects the employment of its own citizens isn't really a part of the global economy now, is it?
AA10911602	They seem to work much better, with some controls anbd protections for consumers.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	because it works. keeps the people happy.|`|6Fh78jK6aa	There's a good documentary called Commanding Heights that illustrates the reasons for this transition.  In a nutshell, the Cold War was not only about an arms race between the Soviet Union and the US, it was also a competition about economic models.  The collapse of the Soviet Union, and the later mass starvation under the Mao communist regime in China provided sufficient evidence for free market supporters that communism (a command economy) isn't the way to go because of the gross inefficiencies under such a regime.|`|jLDgei7faa	because nobody wants to be controlled by the government
MnGGEMwBaa	In the end no. Appearances mean nothing when you may be sitting in your corporate chair or mansion living room and you are unhappy with your position. A person that can walk down the street smiling and whistling is sccessful and any bigshot that see's these people are jealous (if they are unhappy). Financial success or whatever is important it gives us a goal in life but who gives a ****. You'll still live for 80 years and die. People should strive to be remembered thats success. Bravo Einstein|`|NFzmSOPKaa	it is success, in a certain area, it is just not total success. like for example, getting an A on a paper, but you are are straight A student, so you just pass it by. you are successful, but that doesn't mean you are happy.  and if you can't connect w/ that example imagine you get a promotion in work, but you barely get to spend anytime with your family or just having fun. it is success, but not happiness. basically it is up to the individual to decide what they think success is, and if they believe you have to be happy to be success then that is their def, but i would say yes.|`|cK8TnRHRaa	Success: "the favorable or prosperous termination of attempts or endeavors"    Success is relative to your goals or endeavors. So yeah, in some cases you can have success without being happy along the way (such as when taking a test) or even without being happy once you you've achieved your goal (such as when ending a relationship).|`|f5R5BPTDaa	You can be rich without money.  BUT...  There can be no success without happiness.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Not in my eyes, because happiness is the essential ingredient to success, for me.|`|iddMxOroaa	Not in your eyes but maybe in other people's view, it could easily be seen as a success, because their happiness is different to yours.
s89uFNyeaa	I know exactly what you are going through. I remember being in middle school, taking a test with a runny nose. It was getting real bad, but I just kept sniffling because I was too afraid to get up and get a tissue. It's a completely normal action to get up and get a tissue, just like it is completely normal for you to ask someone for a pencil, but we both feel a lot of anxiety at just the thought of doing it.    I think it is normal, but it is something to overcome. I know it's easier said than done, but try to force yourself into social situations. Join a club where you can relate to people about something you will all have in common. It might help you adjust easier if you do it with a friend as well. The more you force yourself into social settings, the easier it will gradually become to be in them. You will come to find that there is no reason to be shy and anxious, as people are not as judgmental of you as you are of yourself.|`|f5R5BPTDaa	Anxiety is starting to become the norm because so many people have it.  Stop concerning yourself with normalcy and start finding solutions to the problem.  Meditate.  Affirmations are helpful.  Exercise.  See a doctor for anxiety. The pencil situation sounds like a touch of OCD.  Not sure.  I hope you find some soultions soon.|`|rQdNERK5aa	I am probably worse than you. I have not spoken to one person in 2 weeks.|`|iynxbd9Daa	i used to have your problem...  but the more you volunteer to say things and do things out of your comfort zone the more confident you will become.  i know its hard at first but it gets easier and trust me, life is soooooo much better when your not shy

I was actually in a depressed/bad mood today, and I just tried to shove what was bothering me out of my mind, and it worked for a couple of hours at a time. Sometimes listening to soothing music helps me, as well.|`|DgFaqaqFaa	all depends on the cause of the depressive mood. If it is purely a chemical imbalance then medication along with therapy will help the depression. If it is caused by and event or events then therapy alone may help to alleviate the depression. Another factor to consider is the severity of the depression. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this more.
2f4qTCciaa	I cannot help, but perhaps if you make getting to know people a game, then it would be a lot easier.  Say hi and how are you to everybody would be a good goal.

Look into your past, and see things the way they really are. Don't find excuses, find reasons, then challenge those reasons. Make up a social plan , without stressing over it.

If you ever need anyone to talk to then please email me     streetrodfan@yahoo.com    Search into your past, there are reasons that you are this way.  You need to get involved into small group activities , toughen it out, and then watch as your past resurfaces, you will be reminded of your past, failures in the past every time you are presented with a challenge in the present that you fail , one that is related to the situations of the past .

Everybody worries, but I think you actually have what is called social anxiety disorder. You're not alone, and unfortunately it gets worse the older you get. This is a sign that you are growing up though. As far as guys go, you're a girl so u have it made. The older you get, the hornier guys get, and the more aggressive they get. By college you'll be beating them off with a stick. Get some exercise, do some jogging, it helps a lot. If you aren't too shy, try to make more friends. You hate yourself? You have problems?

It will just make things worse in the end.    Secondly, you just sound really shy. Don't worry about it, you will probably overcome it eventually. And don't go to a therapist, you may think it will help at first, but they'll just take your money and it probably wont actually help.    Thirdly, read the Bible, it really helps. You may not be religious, but just try it, it actually helps alot. And it's free:)  And whenever you wake up or go to bed, you can pray to God and ask for a good day. God reads our hearts and He knows how we feel and what we're thinking all the time. And when you start feeling better, that's God answering your prayer.

Nobody on the internet is qualified to say what you may or may not "have", though, and what would be the best way to help you.  There are many people out there who can help, and seeing a therapist could be a good idea.  If it were the case that this is a "disorder", there's different things that can be done that can help, including "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", which is basically a several week to several month long therapy program which can help make these feelings far less intense and help you live a happier life.  But, go to talk to somebody qualified and get a "real" opinion.|`|cXK6rW0aaa	lol natan. :P   i feel you man. :S   i have days like that but i just think to myself, why should i even care what they think about me. they are nothing of importance to me. and i know this sounds harsh, but i doubt anyone really cares about what you do. sorry if that offended u. :P|`|NvQMQv8Daa	Start something in the evenings or your time off where you talk to people. Not about your life, maybe work, or a community service. Something that gets you talking but doesn't allow you to think about yourself, instead about what is going on in the moment.    Your paranoid? Then take out the yellow pages and start phoning businesses about whatever. Just talk about whatever, doesn't matter about what just do that. It will get your paranoid over.    Just talk, and talk and talk about made up stuff or whatever. You see, the human body needs to speak a certain amount of words per day. If you dont do that, it will talk to itself, about whatever it can.     It will talk about being alone, and how important it is to talk. But, if you use that certain amount of words, the body will stop thinkin about all this.    I know, because i had the same problem.    Yo fo real. Peace.    Oh yeah, starting answering as many questions as you can. RIGHT NOW!|`|xXhkRq0Caa	You are going through some things and need to talk to a professional.

Since you can read people's expressions and understand non-verbal communication that diagnosis is less likely but you are apparently very sensitive to things that are going on and have difficulty communicating with people in spite of having a clear concept of what you want to do. Other possible psychological issues are personality disorders (don't worry, everybody has at least 3) and generalized or social anxiety disorder (which is often comorbid with asperger's) or schizophrenia. But that last one would have almost certainly been picked up by now, if you're bipolar instead that might have been less apparent but it's a long shot for social problems like you're discussing. ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is not totally out of the question but autistic individuals can present ADHD symptoms as a result of their hyper-sensitivity. It's the same with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) which is also a possibility for you since you clearly repeat these same behaviors like looking around even though you're sure nobody is looking at you in an obsessive manner. I personally think OCD is often just asperger's syndrome/mild autism that's been misdiagnosed but some are of the opinion that you can be afflicted with asperger's, ADHD, and OCD like some kind of miserable triumvirate.     Oh by the way something else that goes along with asperger's is an elevated IQ. Depending on who you ask it needs to be at least 1-2+ deviations higher than the average (100 is average), or in other words an IQ above 115-130. To me you seem intelligent and I'd almost bet money you're a good typist and otherwise technologically savy. But if you have god-awful hand writing and otherwise poor motor skills that's also a symptom of Asperger's.    Of course you might simply be over thinking things just as I'm over-analyzing your question and thinking too much about the Asperger's. I know that "you're overthinking things" sounds like trivialization and you've probably gotten it a lot but it does happen, hormone changes can cause paranoia and disorientation in some people and that might be all there is to it.     Conversely just going to a therapist would not necessarily illuminate things. A full psychological, personality and intelligence analysis would be much more intuitive. If you have insurance then do that with a private psychiatrist but if you don't then your best bet would be contacting the psychological services center at your local university where a grad student will do the same analysis for a lot less money. It will still cost upwards of $300 but privately the cost can end out being anywhere from $1-3,000 and you don't necessarily get better analysis.    By the way if you've got no better options you can vent to me some times if that will help.

cK8TnRHRaa	There is no formula for determining the value of 'life' or 'society' - well, I suppose this is for FEMA. Anyway, that's kind of my point. Value is relative.    So, if you want to add value to the relationship between two people (i.e., the lives of a married couple are worth more than the lives of two loners) than sure. It all depends on what the purpose is behind your value.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Your deep tonight.  I just value the fact when I turn the ignition in the car it starts.
ErwP75Mlaa	So what I gather from your question    It clearly sounds like a conspiracy to commit murder, that or assault. But let us take an example from history,     Hitler blamed the jews, does that mean everyone that supported him were hate mongers and followers of religious intolerance. Could they simple be sheep who accept the word of mouth to be factual information in the making.     Even if we rewrite history and say the Jews in question were actually homosexuals, sure there might be people in that group that are homophobic. Yet some might be spurred to hate out of fear if they defend a way of life they don't live or embrace.    But sometimes not everything is done by fear when you have a collection of minds committing one single act. It is like ordering pizza, despite the diversity you find a common ground to please everyone.    Take cult suicide that down the kool aid to be saved and move on to the next world. These people acted out of hope, even murdering their own children.    So despite any accusations that can be made outside the group that committed the act I am going to claim Hope and Fear as possible motivators. Consider it like Peer Pressure in a positive or negative manner, or the dangers of charisma if you rather word it more cleverly.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I'm not clear on this.  Are the members of the "offending" group being accused of "homosexuality, arrogance, racism, etc." or are their victims being accused of such.  God Bless you.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I have no idea what you are getting at.  Many people feel that a victim attracts whatever befalls him or her.  It is a way for them to reassure themselves that it could not happen to them, but it only provides excuses for the perpetrator as if he/she were not personally responsible for performing an antisocial act.|`|8BitaJcJaa	maybe they just dont like him. period.    but maybe the person who is targeted doesnt really care. maybe he doesnt understand the other people at all. maybe he sees them as sick. but he wouldnt be wrong for thinking such a thing because ur description of a particular scenario just proved it.    i am finished.    im through with trying to understand people.    I SWEAR AND I LIE TO YOU NOT. ive been in the psyches of many many people but of all the psyches ive been in the masses was the hardest one to get into. i still have the most difficult time trying to understand the way they think and see things.  the things they say. how they interact with each other. how they rationalize certain things. theyre excuses.     IM REALLY AFRAID OF ALL OF THEM. THEYRE DANGEROUS.    ive lived with them and it was the strangest thing. ive worked with them as well.    I DONT KNOW. IM JUST VERY TIRED. I JUST WANT TO FLY AWAY AND NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN.    BUT I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME.    the funny thing is that many of the poeple i admire are really no different from the masses. especially professors. they're all sick.    I DONT GET IT.    I dont know.  at the moment im much too vulnerable. im touchable. i dont have any kind of protection. i cant use them how i want to. i need the legal system.      theyre not doing anything i cant do. so why do they talk so much sh*t?  i can be self sufficient. i can get a car license apartment job etc. i can also get into DEBT. i can also acquire an enormous medical debt.    ive lived with these people.  its the same thing everyday. they have a routine.they know their cities and towns very well. they have their music that they like to listen to.  they have their friends that they call everyday every other day once a week etc.  they have their fantasies.        but to be quite honest i really dont admire anyone. ive pretended to like certain celebrities. but i really couldnt care less about them. have u seen these people in their music studios? have u seen them jogging or eating in public? have u seen them on vacations?  some of them dont even deserve to be up there.  and many of them are f*cking up the order. i.e.britney spears.  i watched her  little "for the record" thingy and she really suprised me. she's very talented and intelligent. but she had the most sarcastic and cowardly people surrounding her.  they were sh*t. it's as if they were trying to make fun of her.    i just feel like many celebrities no matter how talented are really messing up the order. but it doesn't matter anyway.    the only one i've even come close to admiring is prince. he's extraordinary.  many times he looks as if he's afraid of his fans. i saw this one thing on vh1 recently and in a short portion of the showing they showed him handing the microphone to an audience. but it was strange to watch him do it because he did it with such fear. but it was very childlike.    in many of his interviews he seems scared of the interviewer. of people in general.  even his tavis smiley interview. it was like tavis was sexually aroused or something.  he doesnt even  know how to talk to him. even when tavis does certain movements prince just seems so timid.  why is prince even doing this interview?  look how intimidated prince was at the end of the video.  tavis even became a little aggressive. he couldnt help himself. wtf?    http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/vide...    ive even seen him try to hit a fan. but he played it off though.    watch this. you can see it here.    http://www.spike.com/video/prince-revolu...    1:00    he tried to knock them out. lmao. it looked like he was saying "dont f*cking touch me! get the f*ck off of me!!!"    i would have cried if someone would've grabbed me like that.        Prince is f*cking gone. he's into some sh*t people will never understand.

I mean, I could try and guess, like you don't leave him alone and you want to be part of everything he does, but that would be a guess.  You are there; learn to examine your own behavior and try to be an impartial judge of your behavior.  It will help you to mature and grow into an adult, if you are not one, or if you think you are an adult.  In relationships it can be hard, especially if your partner is also not quite mature enough.  It is through practice that we perfect ourselves; everyone has to go through it.
e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	You cannot take on the job of being the sole morality policeman.    Instead, attempt to live up to your own personal standards and only confront the lack of control in others when you are directly affected.    Think of the lack of control in others as a benchmark for behavior which is unacceptable to you, rather than as a reason for you to emulate their behavior.
uM9vh4X3aa	Yes, it will no doubt affect everyone, but hopefully we are now better equipped to deal with it than back in 1929. I am a student with a part-time job in a shop which I can't survive without, my graduate prospects have shrunk slightly (although some sectors are actually growing and recruiting more people) and my hours have been massively cut, although our sales have actually consistently beaten last year's figures. Universities as of next year will have to reduce their admission numbers due to diminishing funds and/or charge yet more fees! Chin up, though, I know it sucks, but recessions are an unfortunate characteristic of capitalist economies, would much rather not live under Communism! Just focus on making yourself more competitive in the job market, its more ferocious than before. Let's just hope that banks learn from their foolish lending practises. Years ago it was incredibly difficult to get a mortgage/loan/credit without a lengthy admin process, in the last decade, easy as pie, with banks knowingly driving people into debt by lending more than their customers could afford to pay back and reaping the interest.

uSeApMt9aa	I've had this same exact problem. Being a paramedic i work the most awkward hours and can't sleep. Which gets really dangerous when you're performing pre- hospital care. I tried all the sleep meds that a sleep specialist wrote scripts for and nothing worked. And if they did work it did more harm than good. Only thing that I've tried that worked and had no side effects was melatonin. One of my friends (a surgeon) gave me some. They are all natural and have no side effects. Melatonin is what your body would be lacking if you can't sleep. Its natural and already in your body. I would give that a try. Or light therapy ( another natural way).      You can buy melatonin at almost any pharmacy or GNC. Also the light therapy you can buy some equipment fairly cheap on amazon.|`|0VMyjRvNaa	Get a cat.

I suggest some Philip Glass, a 20th century minimalist composer. He creates huge soundscapes that you could listen to for hours, and it's often very repetitive. The album Koyaanisqatsi is amazing and easily downloadable from the internet.
Lbulud8raa	You are aware that much of it is caused by governments and I ask that if the poor are poor, then how can "the rich" steal wealth    Much of the economic trouble in the US comes fromdebt.    Most of the debt of any nation comes from egregious public sector debt. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the US where the (debased) currency is controlled by a cartel, there is no Gold Standard (hardly unique to the US though) and an ability to place massive public spending "off budget". This was a mechanism to be used in times of emergency, and is now a routine way of keeping the actual deficit figures hidden.    As for individuals,as you mentioned in your email, society as a whole has gone down the path of using credit to support current lifestyle choices. The "poor" are no more likely to be suckered in by out immediate gratification driven consumer society than those who are rich. It is just the numbers are different.    Are these companies and our consumer moghuls responsible for the plight of the poor? I think it is a shared responsibility, but it mostly lies with the person who spends the money. Being poor is often an unwitting decision: I can say this having been there and having learned my way out to a position of being debt free, asset and income rich in six years. The people responsible for much of the marketing and consumerism against which you rail are not usually the true rich anyway: they are in debt too and technically are just as broke, just with bigger numbers. Take away their job and they are on welfare in 90 days or less.    I learned my way out of debt and relative poverty (by western standards) by doing the following that any "poor" person can do    1. I realised that I was largely responsible for my situation because of my financial ignorance and I remedied that.    2. I got out of debt as quickly as I could. To me no debt at all is acceptable: I saved to pay cash for a house and did not get my first house until I was 34, years after many friends of mine had taken out mortgages. Yet my house was unencumbered by a mortgage and wholly mine and they are still paying mortgages off. I have no mortgages, no credit card debt, no lines of credit, loans, liens against me or accounts payable. I do posess a credit card with a small limit for extreme emergencies and for events such as hiring cars: I keep the equivalent of 110% of the cards total limit in a bank account to pay out the use on the card when it happens, so I remain debt free.    3. I taught friends to do what I have done, with some success, yet find the prevailing attitude is that being in debt is easier! I also found people from whom I could learn financial skills.    4. I decided it was I who had the consumer power and I buy what I need and want as independently of consumer pressure as possible.    5. I realised that money is an asset and the poor look at it as a commodity. Thus I put aside money to invest to make more money as a passive income.    6. Many things we call assets are actually expensive liabilities. My home is where I earn my income, thus the $ spend on the proprty are an investment towards earning my incomes from different sources. Cars actually are expenses, not assets, so I pay cash for them and use them in my work as a tax write-off.    Companies are there to make a profit. They are allowed certain freedoms to market and advertise, and this is part of a capitalist system. The alternative is to have everything run by the state, and that is no true alternative because then the state becomes even more of an oppressive monster. Regulation becomes king and the poor, funnily enough, remain poor.    The debt you refer to in your question is private debt. The solutions, in part, I have given above. When it comes to public sector debt, the best we can hope for is good leadership. In the meantime, look after your own households: that is where you have true power.    I cannot accept responsibility for the choices of others and I do share what I know, and none of what I know is any great secret. Check out the resources below, if you have time. I suggest you really check out the first one, the website and you can order the Millenium Money DVD from there.....I suggest it might be good for you and explain much of our current economic predicament, either in the US or elsewhere.    The economy will continue to decline, but, as I suggest above, there are ways tp not be so affected bu it.|`|AA10405438	Yes, but it will get better.|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	It's going to get worse before it get's better.
SxOqWBmDaa	Found this on google, hope it helps    Werewolf:    To see a werewolf in your dream, indicates that something in your life is not what it seems. It is symbolic of fear, repressed anger, and uncontrollable violence.    To dream that you are a werewolf, suggests that some aspects of your personality are hurtful and even dangerous to your own well-being. You are headed down an undesirable path. Alternatively, it refers to your repressed instincts.     Scratch:    To dream that you are scratching yourself, symbolizes a minor irritation or frustration.  Perhaps something that began as minor may have the potential to become worse. Or that somebody may have hit a sore spot in you.    Back:    To dream of your back, represents your attitudes, strengths, burdens and stance in the world. It may also relate to stress and pressure that someone is putting on you.    To see a naked back in your dream, symbolizes secrets that you may have kept from others or aspects of yourself that you have kept hidden and shielded away. Consider the pun, "watch your back!"; this dream may be telling you to do just that. Traditionally, seeing a back in your dream, forewarns that you should not lend money to anyone. In particular, lending money to friends will cause a rift in your relationship.    Bathroom:    To dream that you are in the bathroom, relates to your instinctual urges. You may be experiencing some burdens/feelings and need to "relieve yourself".  Alternatively, it may symbolize purification and self-renewal. You need to cleanse yourself, both emotionally and psychologically.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	To much TV|`|1uIbCMmiaa	I dont knooooooooowwwwwwwwww!|`|kb2q03jvaa	www.dreammoods.com|`|0RstDjygaa	dude your going to be wolverine|`|7gfNIajYaa	I think it means transformation in you and your life perhaps?A werewolf is a scary thing,so perhaps it all means that you might be afraid of change or something like that.

Look at you habits of spending money, and or how you act when you are in the light of a full moon.
IjLyVzPIaa	Well if you're wondering if you're bi, you probably are. And if the dream was nice, then it's a clear sign. Basically you have to really kiss a girl and see how you like it. But the most telling sign isn't wanting to have sex or kiss or w/e, but if you're actually attracted to girls. Think how you feel when you see a cute guy. Do you feel the same way when you see a cute girl? if so, pretty much surely bi. if not, you just are excited by the idea of sexual contact in general. Which is normal in itself.|`|7Vjbpe6qaa	If you have been questioning it in the past, it is possible that your head was having a dream about it because you have either thought about it alot or have before.

NFzmSOPKaa	first realize there are very few males out there completely devoted to religion and for that reason they may not want to get close, personally after dealing with my friend who is extremely religious, but in the wrong way (won't forgive, but is all about god's love and worrying about others faith) i will be very careful about getting close to someone that religious, just a suggestion to get male friends, lay up on the religion and introduce it slowly, attend places guys would attend, loosen up (in other words, get a license and drive, think openly, explore what the world has to offer),   realize if you want to have guy friends you have to talk to them and until you feel comfortable doing so you won't have many, you sound nice, give it a try and it could work.    then again if you only want a conservative, religious, formal dude, well good luck finding one there are not many out there|`|t0PzSCs0aa	not pathetic at all. i'm a girl with virtually no girl friends. its simply the people you get along with better, the people you connect with and enjoy conversation with.     try reaching out to people, you say you don't talk to guys at church, reach out to them. discuss something you heard on the news, even something stupid as weather, just to make the point that you would like to talk to them. often, people dont talk to others much because they think their conversation is not welcome.    it may be a long process, but keep at it. dont get stressed over it.    most importantly, remember confidence. people are naturally attracted to confidence.|`|ed30706545c337d05bacd67afb7a8c30aa	It isn't ridiculous. You just haven't found any cool guys to be friends with. And that's okay. I know how you feel, a lot of guys view girls only as relationship material...and not just a friend. They tend to keep their distance. Go out and find more open-minded people.
cK8TnRHRaa	Why stop? When two people argue they have let their anger overwhelm them and could use a little crazy to cool them down ;)    I also suspect that if the argument were severe enough to warrant concern, you would probably not laugh.|`|ed30706545c337d05bacd67afb7a8c30aa	You either find it amusing or have a case of uncontrollable nervous laughter.|`|AA11938149	I'm no psychologist but there is such a reaction as nervous laughter.

MnGGEMwBaa	You dont need a man to make you feel happy. We all get lonely and need relationships but still.. You say your friends have vibrant personalities.. You just dont express yourself. Learn things do things make yourself a personality be the type of person that you can look at and say wow she knows how to live. Love yourself...thats the most valuable and rewarding love there is|`|zIMlCnVsaa	Of course you will find love or maybe love will find you. You are still young, you're only 18. I'm 23 and still single and very proud to be! As for the being different than your friends, well sometimes being different is not a bad thing but makes you unique in your own way. You have to learn to like, love, and trust yourself before anything. Smile more, be happy to be who you are, and hold your head high because everyone feels this way at times.|`|VkFWgXaHaa	first off think positive...always say to yourself that things will get better...

BhumxInEaa	There are two distinct issues here:    1. Is it in China's interest to abandon its dollar peg?    2. Is it in the interests of the rest of the world for China to abandon its peg?    Most of the world believes that it is in their interest for China to let its currency float, but they don't care whether it is in China's interest.    China believes that it is not in its interest.    Everyone agrees that if China were to let its currency float, its currency would rise in value. This would reduce Chinese exports, make foreign goods cheaper for the Chinese and hence increase Chines imports, and so reduce the U.S. and Europe's trade imbalance with China.    The U.S. and Europe think this is a good thing, because they want to export more to China and they don't like the extent to which they are going deeper into debt.    India and other developing countries think this is a good thing because they hope it will mean that they can export more to the developed world.    China thinks this would be a bad idea because if Chinese exports go down, so does the Chinese economy's growth rate. The Chinese government is afraid that if the rapid growth stops, the people will revolt against the government:  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/busine...    In the long run, it is almost certainly going to be in China's interest to float its currency, but from the Chinese perspective, that's a problem for another day.

Also, you obviously put all your self-esteem into what men think. This guy, by your own definition not a 'gem', so just some average, run of the mill, dime a dozen person with a penis is able to make you feel ugly and like you're not able to keep a man happy?    What would you tell a woman saying these things, really?    Think about that, and let yourself know the truth in it. Or do you truly believe you'd tell her she's worth more than what men say but be saying it just to make her feel better and be nice to her, you don't actually believe it's true?    I've done it, and I'm pretty sexy if I do say so myself haha so I understand, when we're always told how attractive we are, especially if you heard this ever since you can remember, it can really be a part of your self-esteem, which I think is healthy and normal, nothing wrong with loving how you look. BUT when it's like THE source of your worth in your mind...that's ******* tragic!    Get to thinking about everything ELSE about you that's awesome, and think how this ONE guy's opinion is different from MANY others who've all thought you looked great and wanted to be with you, yanno?    We're so quick as women often times to take ONE guy who thinks we're not the greatest ever, most sexy, best lover, best girlfriend/wife and make that personally about US...why don't we think it's at least an equal toss up that the guy was just a complete asshat? Crazy, isn't it?    Many times, it's nothing about you, it's the fact the one screwing with your mind enjoys doing just that and they're the ones who are plagued with unlovable and unworthy qualities, not us!

Sister , I am not a  girl either. I am in my 50's but I am happy how I look. Hell, I've been through some tough times and I am surprised I am still alive. I have had a lot of illness and I look good. The thought that some guy would try or be allowed to take my confidence is crazy. I don't know what to tell you but be glad his psycho drama mind games are now going to be played on someone else.

I mean having the ex gave you a sense of security you wouldn't normally have had. From what you've said I think you may have confidence issues and focus too much on your looks, like that is all you are worth.     You need a sense of self worth that is not tied to your appearance and having a boyfriend. Maybe get a hobby or play a sport. I don't know. But I don't believe there is a "snap out of it" solution here. You need a personal growth solution. It will take a long time.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	EGH!  My ex did this exactly to me too, and I came out of it feeling just the same as you.  Honestly what snapped me out of it was picking myself up, getting in an outfit that made me feel sexy and getting out with friends and family and shaking my groove thang.  After awhile I started noticing how many men really did look at me, I just never noticed before because I was too busy looking at my ex looking at other women.    It took awhile, and there are still 'those' woman that make me want to hide, but I just smile and find something to compliment them on.  Why should he have had any control over me in the first place, let alone after it's over!    He's a putz.  His age has nothing to do with it, men of all ages are like that, and there are men of all ages who are not.  It's a personality disorder in my opinion.  NOR do I think you would be like this with out him.  You gave him your heart, and trust, and abused that.  It's normal to be hurt from this, and with ay other kind of hurt will take time and effort to heal.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	simple.....dont date younger men. what did you see in a young guy who cracks his knuckles? when you can be with a real man, more your age or older.    look, i am your age and i feel like an old looking man compared to the 20 year old guys. even though i still look good. nothing we can do about it.|`|N0fCDn33aa	Don't worry he's the ugly one.

7J6m0L3Haa	This soul that kind of shines through his entire body. Like a vibrancy that you can see in the way he smiles and laughs and opens himself to the world. I love a happy smiling man with a positive attitude and a great ability to be silly while taking the time to be accommodating and pleasant to everyone. But it can't be fake or for some manipulative goal. I like men that genuinely like people, love life, and see the good in everyone. I don't like surly arrogant emotionally withdrawn men. That's a total turn-off.    I guess the second trait would be a strong sense of justice and fairness with a contemplative intellectual introspection. I like my partner to value justice and peace in the world and to find suffering intolerable. I like a man who reads and writes and can hold his own in some sort of intellectual endeavor. Learning is something that he values highly, and the pursuit of knowledge is like the best hobby. But this has to be in conjunction with the other trait: he has to be humble and accommodating and want to share his knowledge with other people without thinking himself intellectually superior in every way.    I know I totally went into far far too much detail. Oh well. I've been dating for almost a decade now, and those are the traits that I find are the most conducive to healthy harmonious relationships. I've dated fat men, skinny men, tall men, and short men. But the man that meets the above criteria is a gem in a sea of trash.|`|IuP0ryOMaa	Big tall men always catch my eye.  Like 6'5 and maybe 240.    And I am super attracted to brainy men!!    Good hygene and likes to read are also a plus.|`|dYwvTj5Caa	To me, it has to be personality and looks.    Money isn't important, unless if he's lazy. At least TRY to make money. If not, the future doesn't look too bright.    Also, the way he acts. How he reacts to certain situation and how to handle it with flow. That's sexy.|`|62ZBofvPaa	1)  Personality--I have very specific tastes in personality.  He can't be all corny, loud, stupid, cheesy, obnoxious, trying too hard to be cool or romantic (those things you either have them naturally or you don't...), has bad taste, or boring.  Hanging out with someone that has a bad personality is the worst, this goes for friends and for boyfriends.    2) Looks--this is the first thing that people notice when they see you...a good looking guy who dresses well is going to get more attention.  That;s just plain physical attraction working there.      Money, not so much--all the richer guys I've dated make me feel insecure/jealous, because I grew up poor and right now I am a student who works terrible hours, not a lot of money.  I know some guys have this same insecurity problem when dating richer girls, but I don't know if there is a name for it.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	1. Looks- It's first because, let's be real, no one can look at someone and say, "Gee, he looks so...honorable and charitable".  You can't tell these things from looking at someone.  You can, however, tell if someone looks like a gremlin or not.    2. Appearance: This differs from looks.  I don't care what kind of body you have or how nice your features are, if you don't know the value of chap-stick or an iron, then it's not going to work.  You can't look dirty.    3. Diction and articulation: If you don't sound intelligent, forget it.  I can't deal with "Should have went" or "That's more better than that".|`|iqqQLSDDaa	Intelligence is my top thing.

You don't necessarily have to be the most attractive person in the world, but you need to make an attempt to look good in your own personal style. Take care of yourself, and don't be afraid to range in the metrosexual area. Make sure your hair looks kept, and if you're going for the messy look, make sure it looks like it's intentionally that way. Shaving is important too. Just don't look sloppy.   The second thing I'd pick is personality. Now, you can't really change your personality, because that all depends on the person. But a personality that I find attractive is having a good sense of humor, and being laid back. Being intelligent in they way he speaks is also good, but without sounding too intelligent, if you get what I mean?

Intellect  ...     What's the point of being with somebody who doesn't make you think? The added bonus of this one is that generally intelligent people are both funny and as un-politically correct as I enjoy. I like to be challenged, made laugh and be able to speak my mind without having my opinion censored.

8d8ejHPfaa	Hm. Well, you know, you might actually be on the right track there, have your doctor check and make sure you're not anemic, just to be sure, that may be a possibility.  You're using up your stored reserves for two right now, and a lot of women don't eat well the first few months due to morning sickness.... I've never contemplated the possibility that anemia could lead to dreams of vampirism, but it can lead to some pretty weird stuff like eating ice, dirt, clay, all kinds of weird stuff, so why not?  Sometimes dreams can reveal things like vitamin deficiencies, food allergies and stuff... Congrats<br>  <br>  No, I don't think it means that you crave blood, but if you're low on iron you could be dreaming about vampirism as a symbol for that your reserves are low, and you need to build your blood up....<br>  <br>  Not every one who is anemic eats weird stuff, but sometimes people do, so I was following a line of thought that if anemia can compel some people to eat weird stuff, it might also bring on other weird things like vampire dreams :)  If you feel dizzy, might be good to check out, if you're feeling dizzy after you eat, you should maybe have your blood sugar checked...|`|gTjtaG0Faa	every time i am pregnant i have hunger dreams, sex, food ect.<br>  your body craves so much constantly that your dreams follow.<br>  congratulations!<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:<br>  no, you don't crave blood, lol or violence just flat out crave/hunger.<br>  Also when pregnant you want to feel beautiful again instead of a big blob --- I really hate being a blob love the babies hate the blob.

I had this dream once, where this girl left books in her locker and then a teacher told me to give it to her.  For me, it doesn't mean anything to me, but maybe your dream was just one of the dreams where they play in your head and you just can't let go for a while.  But then, later, it doesn't make sense, like most other dreams people have.  I had one where i was in victoria.  That, was weird.
521b59edb3741709125de08d3cb0a44eaa	Okay I'll give this a go. I think there is predominantly two factors of the brain. DNA being one factor, and influence of a persons surroundings being another.    DNA for example can vary considerably, like to someone in another country miles away would have a greater difference than say if you have a brother or sister, however the DNA influence on the brain is most likely minuscule relative to the influence factor.     Influence of a persons surroundings would be for example, you have as you say two graduate students, they adopt an Ethiopian child and the child lived with them and grew up with them. The child would be influenced by the parents (the graduates), and other variables like friends, culture, knowledge obtained both in life experiences and academical. So, the child would be just like a child they gave birth to themselves because of the social surroundings involving him.     So in conclusion, yes. I think IQ and race can differentiate between individual people, but only slightly. To the degree that it can be ignored.          Don't let all your chickens roost.|`|ne22im5Haa	The  worth of the findings outlined depends very much on how you value IQ and what IQ tests actually measure. IQ tests are a poor measure of intelligence and as far as geneticaly inherited intelligence have almost no value at all. I can postulate a genetic mechanism that will produce precisely opposite results to those shown on the maps presented. As technology advances life becomes easier and stupid people do not die as they would if they had to live in a primitive society where a large variety of skills and abilities are necessary just to survive. It follows that a great flexibility of mind will be required to acquire said skills. By this logic the industrialised world will evolve increasing levels of stupidity whilst undeveloped nations will continue to weed out the stupid through natural selection.   The modern concept of IQ simply measures the qualities that seem important to the Westerners that developed the concept and has in fact no relationship to evolutionary fitness or adaptability. George Bush is reported to have an IQ of 125 yet I feel sure that left alone on the African plains he would be eaten by lions, children or wilderbeeest within  a few hours.|`|4qNYNG41aa	Ok,this not politically correct, but it is a fact that most black children have lower IQ's then most white children.  I do not think this is because they are black, I think it is because of poor parenting, schooling, poverty,ect, not their race, rather their circumstance.  There is no reason that a black or ethnic person cannot achieve what a white person can.  I also hear that Asian's have higher IQ's then white people.  I also think the IQ test is irrelevant and inaccurate, I scored 143, but I am so terrible maths I am almost dis-calculate.  Clever people in every racei, and dumb asses too.l|`|LjsRfaskaa	I think the concept of race and IQ being linked, is as daft as the Victorian notion that facial features affected IQ. All convicts looked like neanderthals while the upper classes looked like angels.     They all thought chimps would have the highest IQ's next to humans but it actually turns out to be pigs. In experiments of learning pigs pick up a new thing in ten mins to an hour, not that far behind us,  while chimps took months.    Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|6Fh78jK6aa	Malcolm Gladwell has published a great piece on this.  The Flynn Effect discounts any correlation between IQ and Race|`|ToztjpAsaa	A moment's thought would suggest that there must be an hereditary component to IQ, whatever IQ is, possibly for some of the reasons you mention.  Graduates tend to marry graduates, and their children are more likely to go to university.  Parenting skills, socioeconomic factors and the like also have a part to play but it would be silly to rule out inherited traits.    I don't hold with the idea that racial differences are significant.  Intelligence, or the lack of it, has nothing to do with skin colour.
ed30706545c337d05bacd67afb7a8c30aa	Just don't care. Believe in yourself..you know who you are, you know your strengths and weaknesses, you know your character. You are the only one who can define and change those characteristics. Always work towards improving yourself. Don't be arrogant, be humble, honest, and polite. Sincerity isn't vulnerability unless someone is out to hurt you. Do keep your distance till you know someone's character and personality...people can definitely hurt you and stab you in the back. And you know what? Those people aren't worth your time. If someone can't see what you have to offer, they aren't worth it. Stop feeling like a failure. Be positive. Put yourself out there...make yourself feel good about yourself. Evaluate what you've been doing wrong, accept it, and work towards changing it. When you focus on your problems it can also be hard to blossom into the person you want to be. Find a balance that works for you. Always remember life goes on..you might as well enjoy the ride and make it what you want it to be.|`|EITi9oeDaa	Though I'm taking psychology I will answer based on experiences. Rejection can be worrisome but you can't fester upon. Don't think of them as 3 years you've wasted instead as 3 years you've learned from. For the next relationship do something diffrent. Perhaps establish the fact that you would like an actual relationship earlier on (but not too early). Don't begin to put the idea in your head of rejection.. Sometimes people may reject. But if they're the one for you they won't (:|`|DgFaqaqFaa	everyone has a natural fear of rejection, it is not something you can really get over. Every situation in our lives teaches us something, both the good and bad. Take a look at the past relationships and see what worked and what didn't. By analyzing (not obsessing) you can try/attempt not to make the same mistakes in your next relationship.
HkXYGAOdaa	Yes.  There is a way.    I had and still occasionally continue to have intrusive thoughts that would practically paralyze my ability to enjoy life.  For me, it was always worrying about the past, regrets, wishing I could change things AND at the same time worrying about future and thinking of the worst scenarios for my life.    long ago, I had read of the Zen philosophy's principle tenet:    put down the past-------------live in the now-------------put down the future    put down the past because regardless of what we do, we won't be able to change it; so just have a ceremony or a burial for things in the past that bother you, so visually you can see yourself putting down the past.    put down the future because NOBODY knows what will happen the next second, nevertheless tomorrow.  Most of my intrusive thoughts were about future and how i will be able to survive.    Live in the now.  Right now, you are John doing something, focus on today, and today is still young.  I have about 8 hours more left of today, and i shall do and focus on things now.    Try it for a week.  Consciously tell yourself live in the now when intrusive thoughts of the past and future even start.  Train your mind; you really can do that; train your mind not to think beyond today.      I hope this helps.      It's worked for me often times.|`|pWxh08O9aa	Counseling, CBT, CT,  Intrusive thoughts are a part of OCD btw|`|5hNYn1x7aa	medication|`|YFgREceaaa	yo cheer up what are intrusive thoughts..like wanting to cut urself or something?|`|cK8TnRHRaa	The short answer is to seek medical help.    If you really want help from a forum like this, you really do need to provide more information. Intrusive thoughts could be anything from remembering a traumatic event to reoccurring thoughts about killing someone. Either way, it is unlikely that you'll find much help here.    Something you can try on your own to help work through your thoughts is to practice meditation. It may sound rather "east meets west", but as one who has practiced meditation in the past I can tell you that it provides you with wonderful control over your mind. Think of it as working a muscle that helps you to focus. You won't notice much at first, but with practice you'll get strong.    I will say this again though because it is very important. If you have serious concern about this, seek professional help.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Resentments are the killer of our Spirit, one must deal with them,   accept them feel them, let go of them, until they flow out as fast as they flow in.|`|NFzmSOPKaa	how are we suppose to help if we have no idea what so ever about the "intrusive thought"   you at least got to give a subject|`|2AH1EjGAaa	So wait, you hear voices?

Anyways, with every problem, you need to understand why do you have this problem, where is it coming from? Does it really exist? Is it really a problem or is it just a bad habbit that you need to get rid of? What are the causes behind this problem? What are the reasons that you are acting this way? Is it really that big of a deal? At the end of the day, remember, nothing is worth it, whatever it is you don't like, just get rid of it, get a piece of mind.|`|qNmUKWDCaa	There is always a way. The real answer can only come, though, from knowing the real problem. No doubt, contrary to your opinion, there are thousands of people out there dealing with the same thing; and thousands more that have found a way to beat this thing.     I don't know what you've tried and how bad or often the thoughts are, but telling someone close to you about it--as hard as that can be--can help. Just having someone in your corner can make a big difference.     Also, analyze those thoughts. Are there patterns or certain things that are happening when they come to you, or certain things that trigger them? Then that can be or lead to the root of the problem.     Set up boundaries to control those moments. Find something to do as soon as those thoughts enter; maybe you put in a movie that inspires you as soon as a thought enters your head.     If it's really bad and no family or friends can help, you may seek help through online forums where people are dealing with the same thing or from a local therapist.     You can do it!|`|50HTGzrlaa	Try: Going outside in fresh air for a walk w/ headphones with music playing  Seeing a counselor or psychologist or just go visit your family doctor  Talk to a close family member about it

It depends what route you want to go once you graduate. If you want to be a clinical psychologist, and plan on getting a master's in psych.. id suggest something science based, like neuroscience. If you maybe want to go into business i'd say marketing, if you want to teach maybe i'd say education/educ. psych., if your really not sure yet and just want to pick a related minor that will boost your GPA (psych classes are hard), id say sociology , or philosophy. If your really not sure, id def. see your school advisor who can give you your best options based on your interests and future career/post bachelor's degree goals.
DsEEATKSaa	If you want to give feedback to a former therapist, the mature, responsible way to do so is in person. A good therapist welcomes this sort of feedback. If you want to do this, simply phone the office and ask to speak to the therapist (leave a number if necessary). Then ask your therapist if he or she is interested in hearing your feedback.    If you were to issue such feedback in a roundabout manner (e.g., have a "friend" tell the therapist on your behalf), it is likely that it would be interpreted as a childish, manipulative ploy, and the feedback probably would not be accepted as truthful. In other words, your therapist will probably blow it off.     ~Dr. B.~
wgZVeLZPaa	No, there is nothing wrong with that. I know my guy wants me to think of him as the best-looking person, and I really do. I think he's hot.     Society doesn't think men are ugly - otherwise there would be no need for Abercrombie & Fitch catalogs.     Observe. http://www.abercrombie.com/anf/index.htm...    Darling, there is no need to insult me. I agreed with your point, and I've been very nice to you for a really long time. I really don't appreciate you bitching everyone out who doesn't agree with you, or even those who do. You are never satisfied with anything, and I'm sorry about that. But your redundant, rhetorical questions and ensuing insults are growing tiresome.  To the PETERCOPTER!  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/2583...|`|A71Uu05Uaa	This is typical female hypocrisy.  The only way to go about it is to man up.    If she makes comments on how "hot" some guy is or is checking someone out.  You can feel free to do the same.  If she b*tches, just tell her that she does it too.  Now, generally, they don't realize that hypocrisy is bad.  Girls are raised to think they can live by a different set of standards than men (that is, no standards).      But, if you let your woman get away with this crap at all, she'll think that it's ok and she'll just keep on doing it.  So next time you see a good looking woman when you are watching TV together, be sure to say it out loud.  If she takes issue, call her on her BS and be a man about it.  If she's smart enough, she'll stop doing it after realizing that it can affect your partner.  ------------------------  I wouldn't be placing much importance on if your woman thinks you are EXTREMELY hot.  Women can smell insecurity a mile away.  Worrying about what she thinks about you leads to trouble.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Look, I can't talk for all women because I'm not an extremely  physically-oriented person. I don't want my man to be either.    But that said, criticizing your partner's features--especially consistently and in a negative fashion--is a big no-no. So is checking out other people.    There's nothing wrong with wanting for a woman to think you're hot stuff. The feeling that they really really like you physically is nice. The whole "can't keep my hands off you" is a great thing in a relationship. I think it's natural for you to want a woman to desire you physically as well as emotionally.    That said, it has to go both ways. Relationships are a touchy mix of emotional, physical, and interest compatibility. When I enter into a relationship, my physical response to a guy is very often more oriented towards what I think of his personality than his looks. For example, if a guy look like Brad Pitt and was a total jerk, I could simply not muster up the urge to have sex with him. It's not happening. But if someone has that inexplicable mixture of passable attractiveness and a great personality, than it's hard keeping my hands to myself.    So it's not *all* about physical looks. It's fine to want to look attractive to your partner, but the two of you privileging physical attractiveness above all else is wrong. Furthermore, so is critiquing physical traits and checking out other people in public.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm saying this in all honesty: QUITCHERBITCHIN.  I'm not trying to be mean, but you seem to whine constantly about, "Why can women do this, but I can't".  I mean, cry me a fricken river.    "capricorn12, then how about when men get paid more for the same work, YOU cry me a river?"    A: Thank you for acknowledging that, in certain fields, there IS a wage gap.    B: Because getting paid less than the loser next to you just because he has a scrotum is not only unfair and unjust, it affects you financially.     "in fact, how about we make it that women can't vote?"    What a pointless statement, considering that we already can and already do.  What are you going to do, take it to court?    "capricorn, i was being sarcastic. my point is if i should "quit my b*tchin" then why should women be allowed to complain about these things?"    Because, Smart One, not being able to make ends meet or vote is way more important than whining about things that you THINK are true.  Who says that it's wrong for guys to be sexually appealing?  Who says that it's okay for girls to ogle other guys?  Where are you getting your statistics from?|`|jIk2ttH1aa	It's not 'wrong' at all for a guy to want to be sexually appealing.    It is however "wrong" for a girl or guy to be checking out other people in front of their significant other.   It is also "wrong" to insult the way they look.    Besides, usually what attracts a woman to a man sexually isn't looks anyway.      Coinicidentally I'm doing a poll on what attracts a woman to a man in this section for a male friend-- and you might want to look in on those answers.    It sounds as if somebody is either making you insecure--- or you place a very high value in mens appearances and get jealous when you are not the best looking?  Funny, but in my opinion I find that the best looking people, male or female are the ones that are the most insecure about the way they look because THEY themselves (not just society) tell themselves thats where their value is.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I think you need to pick your girlfriends more carefully, this isn't normal.

No I don't and I think very few people would. I've never witnessed that in a relationship and I think if a girl was flirting with other guys in front of her bf she would be dumped or be in very serious trouble. I definitely don't do that and a guy would be an idiot for putting up with it. I have a very nice, very attractive guy and I tell him so and focus on him when we're together. Not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's far less effort to focus on the person you're comfortable with instead of wasting energy on strangers. Yeah I notice other attractive people when we're out and about, and I'm sure he does too, but I'm not going to approach them or anything. They might be total jerks.    There's nothing wrong with a guy wanting to be sexually appealing (as long as he realises there are more important things out there) but there is something wrong with a guy who is so paranoid he's ugly based on the comments of a few cruel friends that he thinks all women are out to get him and has problems with the idea of beauty and attractiveness.    Harriet|`|dYwvTj5Caa	You make it seem like men should be sympathize because they "want their ladies to look sexually appealing, but society won't let them". How can you compare that to a woman's rights?    A man and a woman think differently - you should already know that. I'm not a psychology expert, so I can't really answer this according to the books.    I don't understand why men on Yahoo Answers (generally) have to ask questions like these, and have to make debates on how evil women are, and make us ladies defend ourselves.    I don't want to ask personal questions, but are you bitter about a recent breakup? It seems like it.    Edit: A "small percentage"? What do you mean by that? Are you suggesting that most men, in general, are ugly?    Edit: You should actually go talk to real females around your neighborhood. You'll realize that some girls don't share the same tastes.    Generally, a man likes a woman with have a curvy body. But not ALL men likes it that way.     Generally, a woman is attracted to guys with muscles. But I don't care for muscles.    These are superficial things. We're talking about SOCIETY, but not from personal taste.     Society's beliefs are generalize. But where are the statistics?    ... oops.

qNmUKWDCaa	This is a great question for discussion. I have been in both situations. I'm sure it depends where you are in life at the time of the job. For me...    A couple years back I made some really good money running a start-up. But by that time, I had a wife and three boys. It took all of my time, even some Saturdays. While we enjoyed the benefits, for sure, there was nothing harder on me and on my children and wife then to get up and go to work before they were up, then to come home after they were asleep or even right when they were going to sleep. I became a tuck them in and tell them a story dad, as opposed to one who was always with them.     So my wife and I decided to walk away, and for the last two years I have done nothing but pursue a writing career. My first YA book was recently published by a very small press. That basically means all the marketing funds, etc. come out of my pocket. I have done odd jobs on the side because the book does not bring in much money at all. But I have been with my family often, and I can be with them when I need to. That has been the most rewarding thing by far.     Granted, we still have the stress of low-wages and the economy does not help. Right now, I'm looking for a job--somewhere in between, if such a thing exists, where I can support my family, but not have it control my time.|`|zIMlCnVsaa	Have a job that you loved with all your heart but makes little money because life is too short to spend all your time hating what you do.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	I had a job I hated and made lots of money, and I ground my teeth daily plus I was working on an ulcer.

zIMlCnVsaa	This happens to me a lot. I think it happens to lots of people actually. I have to take a hypnotic sleeping med. in order to rest my mind so i can sleep. My mind never wants to shut down and that makes me restless. Maybe you should talk to a doctor about this and see what he/she says and suggests you try. It can be related to stress also so try to reduce the stress in your everyday lifestyle. Remember to smile more because a smile can make all the difference!

Don't bring your home to work or your work home." I did just that. it didn't matter how stressing it might seem . I followed his advise. And the stress went away. If you have insomnia, it is a whole different matter. Go to a doctor to help you sleep well.|`|MnGGEMwBaa	Well in my uneducated opinion it sounds like your conscience is conflicted with how you live or what you see. Dreams always really are related to what your mind has experienced during that day. You have no idea haha I cant think of one reason why the human race deserves to exist so you can imagine how messed up my dreams are ROFL... Anyway see a doctor maybe you can get something to put your mind at ease. You just cant turn off. Avoid any activity like eating or TV an hour or two before bed. Jumping into bed and saying switch off after watching a suspenseful movie is cruel to the mind when you think about it. Try reading or something. Tell your brain to stop whining like an old woman because tommorow is another day and it will be the same as always .. not the apocalypse.. End of the line relax your mind and body and prepare for sleep. Maybe a long soak in the bath with some emotion evoking music (Final fantasy 7 soundtrack YEEHAA!). If this doesnt help see a doctor and they will help you. If not then maybe just dont sleep (Joke :D) .. thats it from me.. Pleasant dreams troubled one

xGb2CBgkaa	actually, world agriculture is not as dominated by multinational corporations are you would think.  the reason for this is the world has a lot of developed, but small countries like european countries and even japan.  in most countries, the farmers are very well protected. agriculture is one of the most protected industries in the world.  as a result, agriculture tends to be very regional with high trade barriers, and are not dominated by multinational corps.    hunger is a complicated problem but it is not caused by the corporatization of agriculture.  in much of the developing world, hunger exist not because of wealth imbalance (caused by corporations).  hunger exists where local farming resources are not sufficient to meet the basic needs of the population.  in the developed world, however, (like the us, brazil, etc) hunger IS caused by imbalance of wealth, but not by the farming industry.    in the developing world, one main culprit of hunger is war, which tends to destroy economies and scatter people.  another cause of hunger is environmental degradation which is caused by global climate change and poor farming techniques that degrade the local environment.    related to the delivery of food aid, corruption is a problem.  in some countries, up to 30% of food aid is "diverted" to local thugs.  then there is the issue with lack of roads and infrastructure to deliver food.  usually, food aid is needed in the most remote locations so food aid is often airlifted to these areas b/c there are no roads there.      in the developing world, you combat hunger by controlling population growth, adopting sustainable agricultural techniques and stopping war.  in the developed world, you combat hunger by increasing funding for food and nutrition programs for the poor.
EktKaBXuaa	Suicide is not a selfish act. People who commit suicide think nobody loves them anymore. People wouldn't care if they committed suicide or not. It can not be a selfish act if someone feels there life is that bad that they can't get up. They need to think Of God because He has a plan for them and wont let them fall. They need to keep trying. That would be a great conclusion for your paper though. Explain how some people think that suicide is a selfish act while others dont think so. You could interview your family and friends and ask what they think and include that in your paper.|`|EITi9oeDaa	Sometimes teenagers may feel that suicide is a proper solution.

US's is wow lol.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	Before anybody gets bent out of shape..  The $10/trillion isn't a crazy number in comparison to our GDP of $14/Trillion.     Think about it like this... If you make $100,000/yr and owe $70,000 in debt and pay $3,000/yr to service that debt, is it really that bad? Because that is really the debt to income ration the US is in and how much we pay on our debt.     Also, if we paid off the debt tomorrow, from $10/trillion to $0.00, you would destroy the US economy.  Does anybody realize that "Debt is Money"?  Paying off the debt would me a contraction of the money supply. You would create 1933 all over again.     The amount of debt isn't a problem. The bigger issue is being able to service that debt as well as expanding the gdp to keep our debt to income ratio low.

Meditate. Change your perspective.     Of the things you listed:    1) Your parents do not get mad at you for no reason. You may not understand why they are mad, but if they are, there is a reason. Be open to understanding why they are mad. Talk to them about it.    2) You do not have bad luck. Luck is the manifestation of one's disappointments. Identify what you think you have "bad luck" on and work to understand why those things happen. Or just let them go and understand that luck really does not exist.    3) People will not hate you before they know you. If you honestly believe that this is happening, then perhaps they are either hearing rumors about you that are changing their opinions, or perhaps they can tell by looking at you that you are depressed and their immediate response is not to  want to be around someone that is depressed. Either way, there's no supernatural reason why people would hate you without knowing you.    4) If you are not physically fit, then work out. Not only will this problem be solved, but you will feel MUCH better mentally as well as physically. This is entirely your choice and within your grasp.    5) If someone says your ugly, then it's probably not because you are ugly, it's probably because they want you to feel that way. Don't take it personal. Understand that their intention is not to inform you of flaws in your appearance, their intention is to make you feel bad.    6) I live in the south, so I understand racism. Again, don't take personal comments about race personally. Is there something wrong with your race? Is there any reason you should be ashamed of your race? NO! Don't let stupid people make you feel bad, you're too smart for that.    7) Who cares if you're short? I was the second shortest kid in my class through most of school. Yet I was also one of the smartest. Now I'm making bank as a software engineer and am very happy! Everyone has things about themselves that they would like to change, but only people that are happy have learned to accept themselves for who they are and see that everyone is imperfect.    8) Stylish?! Ok, now you're just trying to find reasons to feel sorry for yourself.       Listen, you want to change who you are? Then change how you look at yourself. Stop feeling bad about things that you have no reason to feel bad about. Are you dying of cancer? Are you able to walk? Will you ever be able to have a family? People like my brother that have those problems have reasons to complain... you... you just need to start seeing how good you have it and be happy with yourself.    Also, go to the gym. It really will make you feel better :)
Ka97Vu1Waa	It's not really because you "gifted" in the sense you are thinking. I have the same ability. I know what people are thinking, if they are lying, ect. Weed isn't as bad as people think, it's a relaxer. It opens the mind and numbs body senses so it's not like you're high but in a state of enlightenment. So it would intensify because your mind is open. it's kind of the same with acid but acid is bad for you. The best way i can think of to improve it, and this is what i did, is watch people you don't know watch for small ticks that can show what kind of person they are. like, people who constantly flick their eyes around then go to watching the ground as they walk in a repeated pattern means that they are insecure.|`|OtK09o4saa	after i have smoked weed for a while i kinda feel different like i feel like im trapt behind what im seeing and i have to get around it to get out of a "dream or something" could you help with that. i think that you just have good observation skills and can read peoples emotions and facial expressions

KyAjmaOyaa	I kind of understand of the situation your brother is in, but based on what he has said and the explanation you have given me, it seems like your brother is pretty upset about you leaving. There is a special bond between siblings that is very great. Your brother just loves you too much and to see that his big sister all his life that was buddies with you, is moving away next fall.. must have really given him a spear through the heart. I know this because, back when I was younger I used to be around my grandmother a lot and she has lived with me throughout all my childhood and she would do all sorts of things for me everyday. But then suddenly after hearing that she is going back home after years of staying.. I became angry to her because I did not want her to go. I thought that she would understand that I wasn't happy about her leaving, and that would change her mind. She did know why I was being angry with her, and had to leave though. You shouldn't be upset or depressed because of your brother saying these things. Your brother may be more upset than you are. You know, guys express their feelings in many other ways than visually crying like girls do. It must be a pretty hard time for your brother. Ask him if he is upset that you will be leaving soon, even if he says no.. he is lying. Give him a hug and try to calm him and say you will always come back, and say that you are only going for a little while. That should ease his mind up a little bit. I'm really confident that this is the issue with your brother, and all that's going on here is that your brother loves you a lot and does not want his big sister to go away from him. A very good bond between you two. I hope all goes well and God Bless You!.. Hope your brother feels well too.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Your brother sounds like he is very angry for some reason.  Do you have any clues why?  You mentioned a health problem.  Was there a chance he might have been worried about losing you?  Pushing someone away is a coping skill used by many people when they are afraid of losing someone.    If not, then I think you need to have a heart to heart with him.  Maybe take him out for dinner and a movie to reconnect with him.  You might try asking your parents if they have noticed any changes in his behavior recently.    He may be just having some of his own growing pains. If he is 17, he will be getting close to graduating from HS and this is a tough adjustment for a lot of kids.    Responding in kind to him isn't going to help anything.  Moving out and not having this resolved will make it harder to connect with him in the future.  It sounds like your relationship is worth trying to save.    Good luck.|`|g2xlxZEZaa	maybe hes tired of your negativity. people can take so much|`|AA10708106	it could be one of two things   he is jealous of all the attention you have been getting making him think he's not as loved or as important.  or he is upset that you are sick and he is emotionally detaching himself cause in his mind he is scared something might happen to you.|`|TuDijx3laa	He could probably be going through a stage during puberty. Boys around that age tend to think that they know more than others. I understand and see where you are coming from. He may think he is being cute in joking around like he is, but it comes off as plain negative.      Another thought in mind is that maybe he doesn't like to see you sick. He may be trying to cover it up by being condescending and negative so he blots out having to see his sister go through a rough period. What he doesn't realize is that it's causing you your own health by making you even more hurt.      For your self esteem I think you should try to not let it affect you which you are trying to do now. Of course it is going to affect you on some level but you don't need to waste your time around him if he is going to be negative. All it is doing is opening a hole for havoc. You do not need this right now. You are trying hard to set out a path for your life and you don't need the extra stress.      I think the only two things you should be concentrating on are your classes and moving out at next fall. Maybe to occupy your time you can try figuring out some low budget ideas for your place and how you can decorate it. Do things that are going to build you up to looking forward to it. Maybe even write down lists on goals you want to accomplish. I hope everything goes great for you in the long run. What you are doing now by concentrating on your studies is admirable. Keep doing what your doing!
bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	If every girl/woman and even men as well, reaaaaallly saw what was real and not on tv or in magazines they would realise that they looked like a lot of other people and they aren't that fat at all.    If you read magazines about celebrities one page says "Sarah Moggynog's friends are concerned about her increasingly thin body" and the next page says "Cellulite - the enemy! How to get rid of it!" (A lot of people have cellulite and many people no matter how thin STILL have it, it is a natural thing). The next page will say "Hillary Wogglewimp has been packing on the pounds - photographed pigging out on burgers and chips! Shock - Horror!"    NOTHING is perfect in otherwords. No matter what you look like, no matter what features you have they're wrong. In one magazine a big nose is pretty, in another it is vital you have nose surgery right away to fix it. One magazine talks about healthy, veluptuous celebrities on the red carpet and another talks about how the slim celebrities diet and exercise. Red hair is attractive one minute, Blue hair the next.     What people need to realise is EVERYONE (unless they are twins) is different. Everyone has a different shape, different features, different personalities. That's what makes the human world so diverse and interesting. Wouldn't we be soo boring if we were all the same!|`|v1QIWugFaa	just some ppl r like that personally im hott and no im hott|`|O9HLoDj9aa	It's just how many people are today, especially teenaged girls.

MnGGEMwBaa	Dreams can really split open conflicts in your mind that you may not even realise. Your conscience is a lot more open minded that you are and is smarter than you its the same with everyone.. HAHA dont be offended what I mean is your dream is telling you what you already feel. I dont think its primarily a guy thing. Maybe you feel inadequate to your friends or feel excluded in some way no matter how small. OR maybe your dream is saying that guys will just play with girls emotions (multiple ring giving) and avoid the one they really desire (you darling lol). Either way the best answer you will find will come from you. Analyse it yourself with all the answers you get here and ask yourself if you really are unhappy or feel excluded in some way. At first you may say no but really ask yourself. Your mind will always cover up and say no that isnt it because we are to proud. OR maybe it was just a random dream and I wasted a lot of virtual ink here. Whatever, only you can answer it. Dont depend on strangers. Ask yourself what it means (Dont take wrong way) Anyway If im ever in your dream Il give you a ring....lol ok Il shut up. Sweet dreams|`|Ka97Vu1Waa	it means that you don't really like him and that you know that he isn't really into you but you think that he maybe into someone close to you.
r3gh7ho7aa	I did an interview with my AP Economics teacher for Journalism class about this very thing, except about "America's financial crisis."  Anyways, I respect/trust my teacher's opinion and will repeat a few of the Q & A I did with him here. (And I had previously typed this up lol...)    Q. Exactly how bad is the economy?   A. Historically, its fairly deep right now, but not as deep as it was in the 1980s and 60s. You can go back to several times that have been worse than this. It just depends on what is going to happen in the next year. I think were heading into 2 to 2.5 years of recession. Right now, the unemployment rate is 7.2 percent; historically, that isnt so bad. If we get up to the 10 percent range, then we its time to worry a bit.    Q. How long do you think it will be till we pull through this economic crises?  A. Well, there are a lot of variables that go into that. With all the economic stimulus packages going around and Obama taking over, you really dont know because it all depends on consumer confidence. Fortunately, we have a new president coming in, and with a new president, theres always new hope. I think that will help ease it a little bit, but Im looking for it to be early to mid 2010 before all is said and done about the economy.    Q. With the following year, what immediate effects do you foresee because of our current economy?  A. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and that hurts the businesses that would normally be selling to them. People are afraid of losing their jobs, so theyre going to stop spending. What you start to see is companies, that would otherwise be okay, start to have problems because no one is buying their products. Therefore, youll start to see more layoffs. Revenue generated by sales tax will be down; state governments wont be able to raise the funds they need, and at the national level, hopefully youll start to see cutbacks on pet projects with funds directed at more to places where it is needed in the economy.    BASICALLY... economic hiccup... (not making light of the situation and its effects on millions, however)|`|33lCc8mhaa	almost all economists say that the world economic situation is FAR  far from reaching the bottom, in other words, this is going to get much worse before it will get better. and no i am not a doomer.i just think that we have made some serious economic mistakes, : ie people borrowing money that they knew they couldn't pay back as well as high fuel prices resulting in high inflation just caused the economy to stall like a jet flown by a monkey in late august.

2H2CuvQyaa	because they reside in a low income rural area with no chance of getting out so why not ease the pain of being poor by having satellite and a cell phone?  you can also blame these companies that target low income families by offering contracts and credit that they know these families might have a hard time paying back.  also, just know that low IQ does not necessarily mean a person is stupid, it could be a result of a learning disorder/mental illness/developmental disability.

bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	That's okay as long as you don't hurt them in the process. Just explain to them that you are an independent person and you had a great time and lots of fun and you can keep in touch via (facebook or something).     I'm 21 and felt the same way for ages but what I found after I went to a youth camp is that most of what we say, even to our close friends is really quite shallow. We spend a lot of time faking it or putting on a happy face. Spend time realllly learning about your friends and also sharing stuff about yourself that you wouldnt normally talk about. You will find you have a better appreciation for people and have deeper connections with them, beyond just the feelings, but with experiences and knowledge as well.     But, even if you try that, and it doesn't help, I wouldn't worry. We are all different. I don't NEED friendship either and you probably don't need it either. Don't cut ties with people completely and always remain distantly in touch because you never know when you need a friend.|`|trMsK86jaa	Personally i get tired of restrained environments quite fast.    Which is just about anywhere i'm not alone - People restrain each other.    Not that Everyone does this, of course.    You have to go quite far to find people who aren't restrained in their environment and don't give in to decadent self-serving greed.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	It's depression.  Mostly when you have some coffee with your friends it's to FEED you - you're supposed to gain energy from contact with others.  When you can talk to your friends, this operates as a reality check - keeps people from becoming too self obsessed.    But if you don't feel this way, then you perceive these people of robbing you of energy - demanding from you energy you just don't have, etc.  Perhaps this has a lot to do with your expectations of the world and of relationships.  Perhaps you see yourself as SUPPOSED to be that tireless person who is helping everybody else out....  And you're tired of that crap.    Hard to say.  Might be fun to talk to a psychologist about this, but perhaps you're content with your attitude.|`|AJ3sSGDfaa	You sound stuck-up!  You think of yourself as better than others.

Lbulud8raa	The decline of the US economy is generational yet has not been helped by government actions in recent times either.  The government is essentially $20 Trillion in debt, though the true extent is not reported, and this debt growth is now unservicable.    The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 effectively sealed the fate of the economy by giving over monetary control to a private cartel with increasingly poor regulation and control.  It led the way by debasing the currency, an issue that was rife in early America, and removing the constitutional right to gold and silver money (either carried or fully backed and redeemable via a Mono-metallic Gold OR Silver Standard,  or a Bi-metallic Gold and Silver Standard.  This effectively allowed the government to steal 95% and more of the wealth of the American people over the next 85 years.    FDR's socialist leaning "New Deal" paved the way for an expensive welfare state and it, combined with deficit spending in the US since the late 1940's/early'50's has moved America from the position of the biggest lender in the owrld prior to WW2 to the biggest debtor ever, including per capita.    Manufactiring and other technical jobs have progressively moved to cheaper economies, and the ongoing growth of a fractious government bureaucracy (of egregious and unweildy size) and the huge tendency towards litigation.    Fuel prices are a symptom, not a cause, and this has remedied, at least for now.  The US is only 5-7% self sufficient fpr energy, and yet uses more energy per head than any other country.    Savings have stopped, and people live on credit yo finance basic lifestyle, leading to a further debt-based economy.  Fractional Reserve Banking, with the Fractional Reserve no officially at zero, has also increased debt and weakened banks.    Banks closing and in trouble arises from poor savings and financial institutions gambling in the sub-prime market.    Militarism over the past 50 years has also seen the US funding a big financial hole: the various arms of the military, while sevices at home are cut.    Hope this helps.    Many western countries mirror this decline....as do many elsewhere.|`|sv7tUUTbaa	The economy been going down for like the past 5 years. People who blame Bush are very unintelligent and know nothing about the economy. No, all of these are effects of bad economy and inflation. Back near 2005, when houses was selling like crazy. People would borrow about 90-100% from the banks to buy a house and the banks would loan it to anyone, because the houses sold quickly. For a while the banks and the borrowers gained a quick buck, but the careless banks gave it out to anyone. After houses stop selling, the people cannot pay back the loan and interest. They file bankruptcy, so now noone gets money.

However, after they realize that it was an act of stupidity or ignorance, then the thought tends to be "oops" (Or something similar) followed by them struggling to think of a set of conditions that make them correct, along with a reason why the person who told them it was stupid/ignorant at the time (there always is one) is still wrong.

MnGGEMwBaa	Ok guy with green hair that answer is sucky. Il answer firstly by saying I have no sympathy for you (that isnt true else I wouldnt answer this).. but what Im saying is its up to you to find a purpose in life.Maybe you have feelings that you wasted some years or wish you didnt do something you wanted to.. I dont know maybe seeing a psychiatrist would help.. Sharing your emotion here is definetely a start and I'd love to shake your hand for admitting your unhappy and lonely..You are not alone.. Im only 19 and I know better than anyone that youth is truly wasted on the young but what difference does age make. I realise you were happy until 35 but in my opinion you have feelings of regret about something and you really need to examine what it is. As i said a shrink can really delve into it what do I know. Are you married?? Im guessing not so find someone who can talk to you. I get the feeling that meaningful conversation over looks is what will make you happy. Thats how I feel. Find someone that makes you happy, Exercise, read a book that you struggle to understand, learn to dance, do a bungee jump (x_x). Ok end of the line what Im saying is... GET UP AND STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF. No pill will make you feel better. If you want to be happy get up and find happiness. Dont survive...LIVE! Talk to others more express your anguish. Do things that make you smile even if only for a few seconds. Dont be so cruel to your mind go out and find your purpose. Ah nvm Il go out TOMMOROW.. No go out today.

My guess would be that, like most people who feel depressed or down-trodden by life, you probably replay a lot of frustrating and frustrating moments from your life over and over in your head. That's what depression is, as described by many people--a series of obsessive thoughts spiraling one into the next, drowning you in misery. People also become very attached to their low self-image they have of themselves. Your ego, which is not your friend, wants a stable identity--any stable identity. It is not going to risk "loser" until you build up a structure of something more exciting to exchange it for. But the tough part is building something better when you are making most of your daily decisions, experiencing most of your experiences, from a mind set of feeling like a loser.     Practically speaking, you need to take up exercise, or increase it into a serious daily practice. Walking is excellent. There have been countless studies that prove that you can often quite quickly halt negative thoughts and elavate your mood by taking a brisk walk of about 20 minutes. Beyond these immediate boosts to your brain chemical makeup, you will see an increase in fitness, which will give you a sense of accomplishment. Consider trying something like martial arts or yoga or even dancing. These kind of activities allow you to learn and master techniques, then employ these techniques in a creative, expressive manner.     If you already are a physically fit person, I would also suggest that you should take up either meditation, or if you are religious, prayer. You need to let your brain experience silence so it can fill up with something deeper and more profound than the typical petty, negative chatter of self-defeat that you have been filling it with.      It takes some initiative and will power to do these things. If you feel like you really have tried everything, you should probably consider medication. It can be useful in quickly re-programming your brain wiring to do a better job at taking up neurotransmitters like seratonin.|`|knc97HUvaa	Well you come to the right place, I know for my high-self esteem.All you got to do is relax, become, and dome give a damn what people say about you,The best way to have a high-self esteem is self talk, I talk to myself all the time, thinking I'm gonna get every girl I want, I'm just too handsome, u need it to survive, it also courage, try standing up for your self for once and think that you gonna rule the world(Soviet union).But the best way I do is chatting...not just any chatting but online chatting, if u got a friends(guy or girl) who like to talk about personal thing and brag alot, ask their email(messenger) and chat with em, brag that you hot and all and all the girl want me(that what I did) and they will reply back(in a good way)hope that help.|`|XK2hy07Paa	try making a list of all of the things you like most about yourself, that's what i do, it feels good! :)
BOCqxUagaa	I volunteered at a nursing home and hospital when i was 13...idk if you have any places like that. Librarys usually want them to be atleast 16, but its worth a try. Also the typical "lemonade stand"ideas are good for a 12 year old. Mowing lawns, something you dont have to get a work permit for.     also, she could volunteer herself on her own. Example: Your local nursing home has needs but require her to be 16 to volunteer, maybe she could get a sewing machine and make them some simple, but nice, curtains, or other small simple things that the folks there would like. She could go visit and read the sick stories, nursing homes, terminally ill, pediatric care, ect.|`|0s190C7Zaa	I don't know use her suggestion!
xGb2CBgkaa	The short answer is False.  There is a deadweight loss anytime you have people who are buying things who normally wouldn't have bought it, or you have people not being able to buy it when under normal circumstances, would have bought it.    This case looks like a subsidy, the end result being that the price of the good dropped to a lower price point P" and at a higher Quantity Q".  I can't tell you what the area is that is associated with the dead loss since I don't quite see your graph, but I can tell you at least in general terms, that due to the subsidy, you have additional folks buying when P dropped who normally would not have.  This is considered deadweight loss.|`|13KBWzBXaa	I'm going to give you a link that, if you read and, will change your life.  But it probably won't help you in school.  That's because there are basically two "schools" of economic thought: The Austrian or Chicago school and the Keynesian, which your teacher believes in.    I can't help you with your specific questions because I believe it's all a bunch of hooey. I am not alone, but we are not in the majority.    First some background:  http://jim.com/rights.html  More background, not as long:  http://jim.com/bastiat.htm    Some seriously meaty and easily understood economics:  http://jim.com/seen.htm    Economics in One Lesson (your teacher will hate this!)  http://jim.com/econ/chap01p1.html    You can read more on this site: http://jim.com/    The questions you ask above is why most American's give up on understanding economics. Those who are "in charge" of the official economy (as opposed to the one we enjoy) have good reasons to keep as many potentially interested people out of the profession as possible (10+ trillion reasons and counting!)    Like I said, likely these links won't help you in your current class assignment. And your teacher will likely flunk you if you bring up these things in his class, but if you're game to actually learn about how money works and what makes up an economy, bookmark those links for later absorption.
c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	I think most people have had such thoughts.  It is part of being human.  It's not necessarily a bad thing to have such questions.  They can sometimes move you toward thinking about things in a way you might not, otherwise.  Ultimately, we may never really "know" the point of life, other than to experience it.  If your thinking along these lines is truly at the .1% level, why not just give yourself permission to have such thoughts - consider it a challenge to yourself to think more deeply about life and its possible meanings.  And how, since as you say, we are going to die anyway, to experience life to the fullest.  All the best to you.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I have been on both sides of the track at one point or another.

I've heard lots of people talk about this and I've thought of it myself. For me I just plain don't think about it. There's no point in thinking about it.

695cbbcba51ceed2403cffaf9486d103aa	It is quite a complex process and worthwhile getting a basic introduction book on the subject. Although simplified answers can be dangerous, I will offer a personal view.<br>  <br>  Virtually everything we do is the result of a pattern of neuro-muscular signals. A pattern laid down from experience and repetition. Once established we don't even think about it. However, the pattern can be disturbed - by accident or design - and the effectiveness of the behaviour can be changed. NLP techniques enable you to amend the pattern by either overcoming a negative element in the current pattern, or introducing a new element to improve the result. <br>  I have seen it used in a wide variety of situations, with quite remarkable results. It is well worth exploring further.|`|2Q8MmK1aaa	It is supposed to make you more aware of the thoughts that underlie your behaviour and make use of successful patterns of thought and behaviour - find what is successful to motivate and lead you to success and go with it in order to leader more self fulfilled life<br>  <br>  It has little empirical evidence but if it works for people then who I am I to pass judgement|`|AA12084722	There are several books on this.

AMCuX8XPaa	Yes - This is the old SuperEgo of the Freudians.  Meet Mr. SuperEgo.  He's a part of your mind which is sort of angry and punitive and pissed off all the time - and no matter what you do, you're not doing the right thing - you have sinned - you're no darned good at all - you NEVER do anything right.    Everybody's got this - and of course it's all crap - you're doing just fine.  The old SuperEgo is a naturally occurring part of the human mind.  It's defined as "internalized parental imago".  In other words - angry, punitive, paranoid and punishing parents (even if your parents weren't this way all the time) are yelling at you - but INSIDE your mind.      Not sure what to tell you to do about it - everybody's got a SuperEgo, and some are troublesome - some aren't as much.  Some are less punitive.  At 15 years old you're exactly at that point where you're changing into an adult - and that's a HUGE transition.  Might not seem like a big deal to you, but it's a HUGE deal psychologically.  An adult has all kinds of responsibilities - has to make a living - has to get it right - but on the other hand you're conscious that you're a kid and you still screw things up all the time.      Anyway - keep pushing ahead.  I bet you're doing just fine.|`|GUvw17PSaa	that exactly how i feel. i think maybe were lonely or maybe  just how we are idk but i wanna solve this 2.    hope this helps a little|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Your body and brain are growing so rapidly it's hard to keep up with the change. You feel different or more suffisticated emotions and you are start to see the world in a more complicated way, not in the innocent child-like way. This is often when people start to get pessimistic or negative. Try to break this habit. Whenever you feel like you are thinking negative thoughts, think about the situation more realistically. What are the good things I can get out of this? What are the not so good things...and something bad happens will it actually be all that bad, will it be the end of the world? Also try to learn from mistakes and not so happy moments. Everything has its purpose.    If you think you are really down and unhappy, you might also need to look at your sleep, your eating habits and whether you get enough exercise. If you are following a healthy lifestyle you could also have mild depression, so go see your doctor if you are concerned about anything.
aPxmZq00aa	Time literally seems to fly by as I get older. I read somewhere that what makes time seem to fly by is that you aren't having any new experiences. You just seem to to the same thing every day. When you're younger it may seem that way but you are really doing a lot of things you haven't done before or learning about things and this is what makes time not go so fast.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Well, I've been alive a very LONG time - and I have heard that time seems to pass more quickly as one gets older.  But I've sure not found that to be true.  Time seems to pass at the same rate it always did.      Perhaps as we get older we figure out better ways to waste our time.

sX9Ilrpxaa	To become an archaeologist you should either study archaeology in college or study anthropology with a concentration in archaeology.      Salary depends on what job you get.  Some archaeologists become professors and teach archaeology while doing reseach, others work for governments or museums, and some do contract work for CRM (cultural resource management firms).  You won't become rich in any of these careers, but you can do fairly well.    Archaeologists do research all over the world, so you can travel if you would like to.  However, it is also possible to find a job where you will be able to stay in one location most of the time.    I suggest you look here for more info:  http://www.museum.state.il.us/ismdepts/a...
yepd9psLaa	because when your on stage you just see a sea of faces and its not really personal but when you get in front of class you see them can look them in the eye and feel like they are judging you under an intense spotlight.|`|Ozeg1lIhaa	because your doing the speech by yourself <br>  and when you cheer and stuff, you work as a teamm.<br>  ?|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Maybe you need the stage effect.. just imagine if you give a speech, it's something out of a play.. you are reciting the role of some important play.. a theatrical play and you imagine yourself standing on a stage as an actress.. and every good actress and actor has some stage fright., that's normal, but it goes away as soon as they step out there.. they are all a bit nervous before they actually say..<br>  ''Curtain up'' Act one begins''.. so see this as a theatrical recital.. and you will not be nervous and the audience are all white little bunny rabbits.. waiting for the Easter recital already.. they look really cute and funny in their pink and blue...a naughty one is nibbling on a carrot.. that is surely not allowed in a theatre  , LOL !!! xxx|`|GuxPC1Kyaa	I think that's because:<br>  1. you're not in a team<br>  2. you don't really do what you like doing<br>  That's what I noticed. When I play with my band, I don't feel the stress at all because I love playing in my band. Even if there are like 300 people watching me play. When I'm alone on stage, I'm a bit more nervous, but when I already start my 'show', the tension goes away. But when I have to talk about boring stuff, like history (I haaaatttteeee history), I really get nervous. Maybe that's because I don't know much about history lol or that I start to think about something else... I don't know why but that's just how it works I guess.
5oUyPxuuaa	any roadway project or development in the united states requires that cultural resources be surveyed. this is where historians and archaeologists make an impact. If the state road that runs near your house is being widened or a new culvert is to be put in, an archaeologist must test the area for buried cultural resources as stated in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended through 2006.   http://www.achp.gov/nhpa.html|`|VG4yYvrsaa	The most important  is the way in which archaeologists and archaeological evidence collectively alters the context of modern society, giving a sense of Identity.

Make a pact that when you leave the wedding behind you don't think or talk about it at all and will help one another stick to that promise.<br>  Try to to things together at home that are romantic, watch a movie, pop some pop corn, have some soda or beer and get out the blanket.  Relax and unplug the phone.  No wedding talk.  Take a hot shower or bath together, or read the paper in bed together or have breakfast in bed together with NO talk of the wedding.  Take a long walk and just enjoy one another, talk about when you first met.  Be lovers, pretend you are in Paris.  Be creative.  Good luck!!<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness

N2PcehV4aa	It is normal to seek out others who may have gone through similar problems you may have faced, but I cannot say it is normal to just stop random people in the street and ask them very personal questions. That is what internet chat rooms are for my friend! Anonymity.|`|LGkb4xibaa	no. Your not insane. But you are a little strange. Your very grown up for your age and have obviously had a lot of stuff happen to you. Its made you have quite a negative outlook to things.    Your right. A lot of people are stuck in dead end jobs they hate. Its not because theyre too wrapped up in it. Its because they have no choice. Theyre only trained to do one thing, or they need money and work stability that job brings in order to provide for their family. It would be lovely to be able to jump from one job to another without a worry. But thats not the case for everyone. And some like their jobs and are just wrapped up in it because their enjoying it a lot.    I think maybe you ask people so many questions because your trying to learn how to deal with your problems and you learn from how they have dealt with things. Also your trying to learn in advance. In case you encounter any of their problems- you'll know how to handle them.    Problem is, some people want to keep that stuff to themselves. It makes them feel safe that their feelings are private, and sometimes they dont want old emotional wounds opened up. People bury that stuff as it makes them feel better. Its a survival method that humans have. Opening up to a virtual stranger is not what a lot of people do. Which is why you may get odd reactions. So be careful when you pry.     As for them seeming fragile... We're all fragile! Im fragile. So are you in your own way. You cant call people fragile because they wont open up.     People are not brainwashed because they dont see your viewpoint. They just dont agree with you or dont want to open up. I do often think people are brainwashed to a degree...their brain is trained into a rut. But thats up to them. Its not down to anyone to try and 'rescue them'    I think you might be better off seeing a counsellor who will listen to the problems you carry round with you. Or an understanding friend. And try to see things slightly brighter if you can.|`|AA11400829	You're definitely not insane.    First of all, if a stranger came up to me and asked what difficulties I had gone through in life. I would tell them it's none of their business, because it's not. That's for me and whoever I feel deserves to know.    I don't think it's unnatural to be curious as to how people got through tough times, especially if you have been through them, as you are probably wanting to know so you can find some help for yourself.    And most people choose their career because it's what they love and enjoy. The fact they are wrapped up in it shows they are still passionate about they love.    You will find that, it changes as people grow up. I used to want to be a Mechanical Engineer, then I got into high school and it hit me, "Why do I want to be a Mechanical Engineer when I hate math?" So I changed, and I've probably changed 8 times since.    Life provides answers, you just have to wait for it.|`|a4f5eff9502035e4660ac34d96e762a7aa	For a 15 year old...you see the world more clear than most adults. Life is all in what you make of it. By the way it really doesn't hurt to be just a little insane.|`|a606b1fc03bca268f8701ae319a21a94aa	You should write a book!  You're probably more clued up than most and even if you dont have all the answers, at least you're searching for them - this will give you more education than you could ever possibly dream of, an education you cant find in any school.  It's called life experience, this kind of curiosity feeds the soul, and you sound as though you've experienced lots and should be proud that you've gone down the right roads.  I would say keep in at school, only because once you've got your education the world's your oyster and you never know when you might need your qualifications!, but dont think that because you're doing that you're being brainwashed - you're not being brainwashed if you're doing something out of choice.  I think you've got it in you to do great things.  Good luck!  p.s Remember there are others who have experienced the same if not worse than you, they just might not want to talk about it to a stranger but it doesn't mean they're fragile, some people are just private about their emotions.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	No your not insane. In fact you are seeking answers. That is very commendable. But what you need is 'Passion" for something. Something that will fire you up and you don't mind the work it takes to get there. My passion is music. I started when i was a kid and the passion never left me. somehow, seeing the happy crowds dancing and me being responsible for it gave me a passion for playing music. Forget the past. Live NOW. don't wait for tomorrow . Find your passion in life. Whatever it may be and go for it. Along with your duties as a student . There is a time for everything. I have been through a lot of stuff too. But  I know that the time to live starts today.

If I had an ear to confide in,  I would cry among my treasured friend,  but who do you know that stops that long,  to help another carry on.      The world moves fast and it would rather pass by.

I personally wouldnt open up to a stranger about my problems in public. Id also think it a little strange if someone I didnt know asked me personal questions.

QAtpLEEFaa	Feminism - on prostituion - focuses   a)on the gendered construction of sexuality  and sexual morality Thus there are several analyses of the historical development the gendered social construction of sexuality which allows men a much wider range of heterosexual behaviours and  imposes a very limited (sometimes within marriage only), form of sexuality for women.  b) women's restricted access to the labour market   thus a) and b) together lead to the much greater risk for women of being labelled as social outcasts if they chose to get paid for sex work.  On the difference between the two - the focus would be on questionning why  the two forms of selling ones body  attracts such different moral and 'crime and justice' responses    Other conflict theorists:(feminism and conflict theory overlap)  Chicago school criminolgists would have  very similar approach but would use the concepts of 'labelling' and 'secondary deviance' in their analysis. eg  how difficult  it is to escape the label  of being 'sexually immoral' once it has been applied applied   Marxian analysis:  the construction of the labour market which channels some workers into certain occupations where they can become most exploited.  To what extent do the two workers have any control over the way they sell their labour.  Who benefits from the profits of the labour of these two  sets of workers How are the two labour markets controlled and constructed?

trMsK86jaa	The importance is tantamount to learning from the evidence shown.    Without theoretical perspective, the words in your books and on your paper is just that - just words and paper.    We only really learn when we combine our minds with what is written.
r3gh7ho7aa	1. Positive  2. Normative  3. Positive  4. Normative  5. Positive    General rule of thumb, positive statements are statements about "what is."  You are cool, the test was hard, blah blah.  Normative statements are about what "should be."  Anytime you see a statement with the words "should" or "ought to be," it's always a normative.
plNl3yILaa	The careers related to psychology are quite varied depending on interest, availability and the matching of ones' skills/abilities and interests.  I am in the education field working for the past 28 years with severely emotionally disturbed children from 5-21 in a restrictive public school setting.  I am a speech pathologist but the thrust of my job is working first with the problems of children who are quite emotionally disturbed. In a public school system one can be a psychologist mainly evaluating students in the area of intellectual and emotional functioning as well as academic and neurological functioning A psychologist in the school system can also do psychotherapy with students, run group therapies, parent groups and family counselling. The education requires at least a masters degree and a phd. or educational specialist degree is preferred. A classroom teacher of emotionally disturbed children relates heavily to psychology field.  In the state system One can also work in rehab center for people with strokes, car/motocycle accidents etc. In hospitals there are a miriad of jobs ie. testing, therapy, research, rehab. In the penal system one can work with lawyers, the courts and in prison and jails. Drug rehab centers is another source. Foster care and  adoptions, preparing kids for surgery -abused children and their famillies. The geriatric population dealing with having to give up independence and live with famiily or assistannt living facilities.Death and dying is another area as is dealing with Aides patiens and catastrohic childrens illness that can be devestating in nature. Crisis Centers and drug rehab program are another area of employment for psychologistsThere are many more areas of studies to be explored.|`|AA11400829	School counseler, counseler/therapist/psychologist, psychiatrist, research, advertising, rehab.

She now says she needs to save more and give more away to those that are in trouble...  She hates school but says she needs to save for college...    The 16 yr old is also thinking about many different strategies...  for her future...    The point being I believe there is a fundamental shift on the economy and the work force as well as money in general coming from our young folks...

oM420kqRaa	Since I have been there I can tell you the best thing is she is asking you for help. If she said she wants to talk to you before she gets help then steer the conversation to where she can get the help. Search "suicide prevention" and get her the information it leads you too. You are in a great position to help since she has shown you she trusts you with her feelings, now you need to get her to trust a professional with them also. It is not easy to share these feeling with someone so you must be a very good friend for her to want your input.   I wish you both the best.|`|qnCfYvLiaa	giver a hug and tell her that she is the friend you want to have for ever|`|bm6NX6nTaa	I also had a suicidal friend, she just needs someone to talk to. And shes comfortable enough to talk to you for some comforting. So whenever you two get together and talk DO NOT just bring us why she was to die, just talk like friends do and if she brings it up talk about it.|`|DbNbWQflaa	ok  this is tricky  i know people think that people who say things like this are looking  for attention, but you must take her seriously tell her she is needed and how much she is loved and how people would be lost without her, i just went through this with someone and they changed their mind for now. my other friend actually did shoot hisself, but really he had problems major guilt , that is why i take these things seriously, you must stay  and listen to her my other friend well he hasnt done it yet i told him that he was put here for a reason and to shorten his life this way is not the answer,so build up her self esteem and be there for her evenif she calls to talk all night. one can loose a lil sleep but once your friend is gone you cant get her back, you have to  really be sincere and tell her how much you love her and how much you would miss her . see what she says and then  go from there.|`|hR1wc0taaa	just be there, no presumptions. call suicide hotline for more advice|`|y1jan1w1aa	how crazy is that?|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Just be gentle and understanding with her. Tell her that the entire nation is going through all this. I think the bullying should be reported to school authorities. Because that can bring a person down to the depths. just be there for her and listen to her. Make suggestions carefully so as not to upset her more. Be strong for her so she can feel your strength.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Try to tell her about how many people will miss her if she does this.  Stress how badly this will hurt her parents.  Often when people feel this way, they honestly don't realize how much others will be hurt by this.  I think that less people would commit suicide if they knew how it would make others feel. So make this an important point, but don;t lay a guilt trip on her.    Maybe you can do something for her, like the two of you can get together once a week and you can treat to coffee (or whatever).  Sometimes just getting away can help, even if it's just for an hour or two.|`|DsycowTdaa	i can tell you from experience it would be hard to convince her not t, so i would drive over there and talk to her and try to get to the root of her problem usually it is from the past experiences that a person has had and they never got over it .

If you don't know if a woman is trying to avoid you or give you the hint, don't worry about it just call the next one on the list. If you call one woman and she doesn't answer, call the next one on the list. If you want to do something and one woman is busy, call the next one on the list. If one woman is making you wait for sex, kill time with some of the others on the list until she's tired of pretending she's making you wait. If one woman breaks up with you, console yourself with the next one on the list.    Remember, a one woman man is just one woman away from being alone. The best way to deal with strong feelings for a woman is to dilute them by adding more women to the mix. The more women you have in your life, the less likely you are to get attached to a particular one.|`|BVe32H7naa	just know most of the time there emotions are talking.|`|Olz3goEaaa	Go through them like a rockstar.

uxwSd0KLaa	You had a real fear of this man when he was alive ; and you are still very afraid of him ; even if he is dead and it stuck in your subconscious ; so that why you had this dream
uBX7R6xvaa	This dream shows that you still have some healing to do related to past abuse, and still fear that your mother will not protect her family carefully enough from the danger of abuse.  You still have emotions that connect you in some way with your mom's emotionally abusive second husband.  People do retain bonds to those they are close to or have had intense experiences with for a period of time after they have separated.  Victim of crimes often retain a bond of a negative type with the perpetrator for some time after being victimized.  You feel a need to protect those who are innocent (your brother who died at birth in the dream) from being subjected to abusive behavior.  You seem to be able to get help to some degree in dealing with the residual affects of the abuse from those who are wise or spiritual in nature(the Rabbi in the dream).  But, you still feel vulnerable(naked) when faced with abusive type energy.  At least you are able to find clothes in the dream and get so you feel a lot less vulnerable.      Meditation/prayer, mind-body or other exercise(not done excessively), and eating healthy will help one to get stronger spiritually so as to better protect oneself from abusive behavior of all sorts.  One needs to be careful about getting connected with overly controlling type individuals in your future.  One needs to develop a degree of emotional independence, so as not to be so vulnerable to those who prey on those they find they can manipulate emotionally.
svOneExjaa	Thanks for all the stereotypes and generalizations. I hope they keep you warm at night. We don't need your respect, dear. We aren't yearning for gaining anything from you. We are already respected and adored by our husbands and other family members, you know the people who's opinions are important to us.

Somehow, I doubt that.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	I don't *earn* respect, I am granted it by the virtue of my humanity. Likewise, I grant people respect until they do something specifically for me to withdraw it.

Decent people don't disrespect half the human population for sexist reasons.    Of course, people have the right to be total disrespectful idiots. To a point. When that disrespect results in systematic oppression of entire classes, races, sexualities, or genders then you have a nice big fat human rights violation on your head. Enjoy.    Furthermore, if I hire you to wash my windows of my corner office, you can secretly think I'm an enormous b!tch. I can't stop you and I don't care.

The number one victims of violent crimes are.... you guessed it women, and the number one gender guilty of violent crimes?  men.    I have earned my respect.

A lot of women just want you to respect them the same way you'd respect another man - for who he is and what he does.  It's when they feel disrespected that they sometimes act disrespectfully.

You can attempt to help the person if they are willing to listen to you and acknowledge they have a problem (which often stems from low self-esteem and wanting to puff themselves up bigger than they are, being taught to lie  or not shown how lying can hurt or enjoying tricking other people).

Britain's debt levels and deficits are not an US levels per capita, but the manufacturing base of the nation is being eroded.  There is too much personal debt as well.

You're struggling to cope with the changes that are taking place in your body and personality as you're developing into an adult. You want to act like an adult and be independent, but at the same time, you're still a child and need your parents. When all your internal and external changes slow down, you'll feel more stable and at peace with yourself. In the meantime, don't worry too much about what others are thinking of you, because they're all going through the same changes as well.

de716a7218c6535ff5cb2a195dc59d50aa	My question is, do you know what it does?     Anyways, the MBTI has been shown to be unreliable, with 3976% of people being tested falling different types upon retesting some weeks or years later.    About 50% of people tested within nine months remain the same overall type and 36% remain the same after nine months.    Finally, when people are asked to compare their preferred type to that assigned by the MBTI, only half of people pick the same profile.    I could go and attack you about your criticism of me using wikipedia. I will however say that while I may have used wikipedia, the articles they cite are from peer-reviewed journals.     And I don't think human inconsistency can explain the inconsistencies that research has identified with the MBTI.    Personality theorists argue that personality is for the most part, stable, with changes in personality only coming about from extreme situations such as trauma (e.g. Phineas Gage).    So if the MBTI is unreliable then there has to be something in it that is leading people to respond in an inconsistent manner and I think that this is the case, having seen a couple of example questions.|`|H8LfYkpvaa	There is a lot of controvery surrounding the MBTI, but mostly within academic psychology - and as you say, it's usually the skeptics that have the problem with it....    The public, however, usually LOVES the MBTI........    Like any test, the MBTI is not perfect. The test-retest reliability of the Myers-Briggs is lower than that of some tests, such as the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. I suspect it is for this reason that the "NEO" is used for research purposes on a more consistent basis than the MBTI.    It makes sense why the MBTI, which assesses "preferences" has a lower test-retest reliability than the "NEO", which measures "traits". Preferences, which we prefer, do change with time - although we probably have one we prefer most of the time (like your right or left hand being dominant). Traits on the other hand, are more enduring and stable - therefore, a test that reliable measures them should have a higher test-retest reliability. I realize that this flies in the face of traditional psychometric theory - which says that reliabilities closer to one are "better" because they suggest tests are more reliably measure a construct, but I think some human behavior, especially choice, defies linear explanation.     Research psychologists have a collective need to construct LINEAR theories that quantify and explain choice.    Let me cut to the case - I believe that some people need to define something before they believe it exists, or even before they can learn from it. Others are content to believe without empirically verifying whether something can be defined or measured.     When there is an inconsistency between the public's perception of a construct (the MBTI) and its measurement, it IS up to figure out why - not to tear down the construct!
3WJi9zLsaa	As you lie in bed ready for sleep you need to start imagining the scene you want to be in.. begin to feel and really experience it... and eventually you will transition into sleep lucid.. sleeping but awake...    the second method is to keep repeating to urself that you are not dreaming ur awake... then as you sleep hopefully it will click and u will remember and become lucid... but then staying lucid is a whole 'nother ball game!
GamCopDPaa	I , a happy Bolshevik just to correct 1 thing money is not capital capital is a reusable good such as steel. also our govt. works off of Keynesian econ. which states in a time of a recession increase govt spending. which just causes inflation (the true definition of inflation is more money in circulation)  on top of that look at how they got the money. its tax dollars so they are giving u back your own money  just to tax it again. its just a redistribution and it will not help at all.|`|ojFatDVnaa	Americans will innovate their way out of this mess and Obamas plan is logical in many ways. Alot of money needs to go into hiways anyways and overall if we can keep illegal aliens from getting these jobs it will be a foundation to work with. Are politicians smart enough to take money away from overseas efforts and bring schools into shape? The plan will be one of the driving forces behind American prosperity.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	No,it will not work.Don`t think I am telling you this just because I want to be  bitter,no, I do know that he will fail.I can explain you why.    To understand it, you must first understand what "fictitious Capital" is.This is the origin of all this mess in the World.    Fictitious capital is a concept used by Karl Marx in his critique of political economy. It is introduced in the third volume of Capital.  Fictitious capital could be defined as a capitalisation on property ownership. Such ownership is real and legally enforced, as are the profits made from it. But the capital involved is fictitious; it is "money that is thrown into circulation as capital without any material basis in commodities or productive activity". Fictitious capital could also be defined as "tradeable paper claims to wealth", although tangible assets may themselves under certain conditions also be vastly inflated in price.    Now, do you know about what amount of fictitious Capital we are talking?  Most fictitious Capital was made as "derivatives".    The derivatives market expanded from a $100 trillion in 2002 to $516 trillion in BIS's estimation in 2007 or $585 trillion in other estimations! Comparatively all the real goods and services produced by all economies in the world annually, the global annual gross domestic product is less than $50 trillion, and the US annual GDP of approximately $13 trillion. It becomes crystal clear that no intervention by the State, by a central bank or by all of them in the world put together could ever control the tempest of this ocean of derivatives.|`|yvWD7xFWaa	change|`|ymU9QGlUaa	No.  It won't work.  I voted for Obama.  I think he is a just and decent man.  But no stimulus will stop what is happening. Obama won't be able to fix it by printing more money.  Bush just ruined our economy, then used a rich banker bailout that will hurt the taxpayers and consumers for years. It's a tragedy because the wealthy will not be hurt like the poor or middle class will be.|`|j8Mv99OQaa	Only if the Republicans cooperate and help Obama with the details instead of fighting him on partisan grounds. In other words, they just want to mess him up to be doing it. All the Republicans care about is helping the rich people and the corporations. Notice the every time the government wants to help the common or poor people, the Republicans always fight it saying it costs too much. But, if it is something they want or benefits them, they are always O.K. with it. Republicans are also notoriously anti-environment. Watch and see how they handle the Global Warming issue. If it has an effect on the corporations and their way of doing things or their bottom line, they will oppose it.
2mqrbxN1aa	Why are you sad?  Then we can help a bit x    EDIT - Well she isn't a good friend then! Move away from this friend and realise that life is way too short to be down about somebody who has no respect for your feelings. She more than likely knows that she is upsetting you and she herself has low self esteem. maybe she is jealous of you for something about you , that you do not even realise you have.    Honestly you could have a chat with her and tell her how you fee. if it keeps on happening dump her!     Good luck  x|`|ZDDBiBo5aa	no one can "make" you sad.  you are responsible for your own feelings.  you need to believe that world won't end if you drop the friend that does things you react to in a negative way, and find a new friend you react to in a positive way.|`|agpCn6Kaaa	I don't know what your situation is, but I can tell you that most things that occur that can make you sad don't last forever.   Life generally has its ups and downs, and where ever you find yourself today (emotionally), will not necessarily be where you will be next week, or a month or a year from now.  Hang in there, things will get better.|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	When I feel sad or depressed music is the only thing that really makes me feel better so I end up finding a lot of good music. I feel for you, but never forget that sadness serves a purpose, if we didn't feel sad after making a mistake then we probably wouldn't learn from it. I was in a car accident a few years ago and I was in a coma for a week, when I woke up I felt a combined sorrow and joy so intense that I can't put it into words. Joanna Newsom put it into words for me, she called it Sawdust and Diamonds, the more I hear it the more I'm convinced that she's an angel. Someone once said to me that when you reach an emotional low point then you feel like you'll never get out of it, but then when you get back up you realize that you're stronger than you thought possible.

nulE8zdBaa	Your last line sums it up: Overt sex in dreams is not a preview of sex in waking life, but a preview of an impending relationship, showing you whether it is going to be love or just a game, whether it is deep or shallow, transitory or more permanent.     Interesting is that our dreams tell us what kind of sex we'll have by quite innocent actions and object. On the other hand when they want to tell us that someone loves us they use sexual action as a symbol.    This is often very confusing especially when girls have sex in their dreams with their father. This simply means that these girls love their father very much; and not in a sexual way.    Your dream boyfriend is certainly a failure in all respects and you should not be disappointed if this guy fails to appear or will pass by like a shooting star.|`|sFKgWed0aa	.  Pls do not feel bad about it. It happens to every one in life U love some one and Sex comes in between just to disturb U and than only U can feel the difference between sex and love.

Than only U r safe and conscious|`|6jkusbCgaa	It is most reasonable to assume that this is your fear of falling for someone you are attracted to but one who cannot satisfy your sexual needs. See this is as a test to see if sex outweighs mental connection.     In short, your dream is rooted in fear.|`|5nQ2bsO4aa	ur next BF will be a disappointment  not just in bed  but an all around disappointment|`|K9z6Pcw6aa	I think it means you just think someone in your future life will not know what he's doing when he has sex.|`|v5otljOxaa	It means, that you find yourself being impatient over the sex thing.  You are not ready for sex because you call it bad sex when he might be on his first time.|`|N0fCDn33aa	Someone is probably awkwardly raping you in your sleep|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Sex dreams actually usually don't have anything to do with sex, and may actually be a symbol of commitment or your subconscious need for loyalty and/or affection.  A dream about bad sex can actually mean that you are worried that you may never find the commitment, loyalty, or affection you seek from a man.  Or you may actually have a fear of committing to someone (even to the point that you dream of people you don't know).  Dreams usually represent things that are troubling you, either consciously or subconsciously, in your dream state.  Your mind is trying to find a safe place (dream state) to work these things out.

6kUx7fwcaa	Epistemology is the study of knowledge and the acquisition of knowledge.  Ontology is the study of development.  Children develop and learners acquire knowledge.|`|5VqfLJcmaa	Prof:  Epistemology is the study of knowledge, how it us acquired and how valid this knowledge is. Ontology is the study of being or existence.  OntoGENY means the complete developmental history of an individual organism.   It helps to know a little bit of Greek to figure out these huge scientific words and since no one learns Greek as part of a good education anymore, it makes studying scientific jargon very difficult. If you give me a couple of sentences with the two words you want defined so I can see in what context they are used, I may be able to explain further. I used Dorland's Medical Dictionary and Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary as aids to understanding the words. Please feel free to pin me down a little further if you wish
qiNvNYO8aa	first of all,you spelled sons wrong,its spelled how i spelled it,not sun,second of all,NO we are not shrinking|`|QAtpLEEFaa	What an interesting question - I'd never noticed that. I wonder whether the same difference applies in American films that aren't chosen by Brazilian film distributors. I think you've got a good research question here for you major paper or even for a  major thesis.    You could set up the hypothesis that inthese particular films the moral or economic power of the father is connoted by their greater height.    It would certainly supply you with a great excuse to watch a lot of films- always a good idea to choose something interesting on which to spend your academic time.      ps being able to ask a good research question like this one  is like gold for sociologists    Well done.
gYEHCKnEaa	wow. i do the same thing. i think it's because like when i'm nervous or when there's a really serious moment, i'm not sure how to handle it... so i just laugh to make it seem like it's not that big of a deal... of course, other people seem to get really angry cuz they don't think i'm taking them seriously... but i am!!!! idk. i feel ya.|`|y1jan1w1aa	that seems normal .... sometimes i do that~~~|`|AA11057741	Oh, I've known so many people that do this.  It can be very awkward on either side.  My friend, after I told her my dad was dying, started smiling, then laughing.  I don't think you're mentally insane or anything quite so serious, but you do need to figure out why you are not able to have a reasonable reaction/emotion to a problem.  I'd talk to a counselor, again, not that your crazy, but it is something you should work on because it will affect your relationships dramatically!  Good luck to you.
ooOf4d5oaa	Even though both psychiatrists and physicians must go through med school, it seems that physicians are paid more. Psychiatrists are becoming rare, in fact, due in part to insurance issues and this comparison.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	Psychiatry is a specialty in medicine.  Typically, specialists charge more and earn more than general family doctors.  If you are talking about psychology, they are not MDs, but they pay far less in insurance and other expenses.  They also get paid very well in some (not all) circumstances.|`|h2gq18I0aa	it would depend on who you work for. however on average Doctors would get paid more.

3WJi9zLsaa	OMG OMG! lucid dreaming is the most advanced state of dreaming! Yogi's practice for years to master it! only very special people can even attempt this!     Being able to sustain the lucid state is extremely difficult but with practice you will be able too! You have already overcome the hardest part, becoming lucid, so now you just need to learn to sustain it.    Usually among the untrained once you become aware your dreaming i.e. lucid your mind will automatically try to wake you up. there are a few things you can do to combat this.    sounds wierd but I learnt it, have tried it and I guarantee it works..    1. wen you feel like ur about to wake.. in the dream start rubbing your hands together as hard and fast as you can.. put all ur effort into it.    no matter what happens DONT STOP! otherwise you will wake up.    2. hold ur arms out horizontally so ur like a giant T shape. then start spinning clockwise..     if you do these correctly everything should go black and then you'll awake in another dream fully lucid and you wont have that feeling like ur going to wake. You can wake urself wen ur ready!    so have FUN!!!    oh and btw... I need your help. I have a theory I need your help with. if Im right you should be able to literally make ur dreams come true..|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	http://www.dreamviews.com  http://www.lucidity.com  "The Master of Lucid Dreams," Dr. Olga Kharitidi  "The Masters and Their Retreats," Mark Prophet  "Watch Your Dreams," Ann Ree Colton  http://www.dreamhealer.com  are helpful.

Instead; you've got to "ride it out", chalk it up to Experience- and get ON with your Life as though you don't really need THEM... (And You DON'T, -because YOU'RE the GOOD One).

When your in your teens things change very fast. Your life is on a fast track. You have a friend and then you don't have a friend. At this age you can out grow friends quickly because everyone is maturing on a different level. What your girlfriend might be ready for now you may not be ready and the same with a boyfriend. It is all part of growing up. Few high school friends remain friends for life. People come and go from our life and we learn something just knowing each one. Take it as a learning experience. Maybe this girl was just not the type to be a good friend. Maybe you need to look for someone more like yourself. But, you will live through it. We all have.|`|kDxljPUnaa	Smile!  It's a new day!    He's the most popular guy in school. So what? All that means is that one of these days he's going to take a fall and it's going to be messy because everyone will be expecting better from him.  All he want to do is look good. That's it, shallow as a puddle.     Just look at it this way, Now there is no pressure on you to be "his girl". You can be yourself now and you will be much better for it.  Don't be too quick to latch onto what other people view as the most this or the most that. That's a fools errand.   Consider yourself lucky. Now take your time and find someone that you will like for being who they are and not some sort of an icon that will prove himself to be nothing but trouble.

If the guy with a gun has the right bullets he could hurt you. Satanists are just people who dislike Christianity while taking themselves way too seriously and going for shock value.     But then again, just because someone has a gun doesn't mean anyone is in danger. And a person without a gun could still harm someone else. I guess the ultimate answer is "the one without a motive".

The less well you drive, or wash your cloths or make dinner - the less you know about banking and economy - the less you know about foreign affairs...  each thing makes you weaker.     So you keep your eyes open - watch the news - have interests and hobbies - become competent and comfortable with as many things as possible - makes for a bigger, less flappable human mind.|`|RnkOEzGuaa	I'm not so much a confident person myself. My coach is always telling me to just "believe in myself" which is really cliche. What's worked for me in high school was just having a good group of friends that are always there for you, being around good people makes you feel good about yourself. In school know what you're talking about, because when you're asked a question you'll know the answer. For sports, just practice your weaknesses.    I've also noticed that my most confident friends talk the most because they know what they're talking about and they're funny at the same time. Do what's comfortable and you'll feel a lot better about yourself.
hyoc61Moaa	You  often can influence your dreams by giving yourself pre-sleep suggestions. Another method of influencing dreams is called lucid dreaming, in which you are aware you are dreaming while still asleep and in the dream. Sometimes people experience this type of dreaming spontaneously. It is often possible to learn how to increase lucid dreaming, and thereby increase your capacity to affect the course of the dream events as they unfold. Some things are easier than others to control, and indeed complete control is probably never possible. Some professional dream workers question the advisability of trying to control the dream, and encourage learning to enjoy and understand it instead.

However, with effective teaching, these differences can be overcome.|`|62ZBofvPaa	No not really...every so often there will be a study saying "women are smarter" or "men are smarter", but overall--they've been about the same.

It used to be that women were much stronger verbally and men stronger with math, but those differences have completely disappeared for math and just about disappeared (besides in some age groups) for verbal skills.|`|n3IV7JuXaa	Not so much, but sure there are some differences in that case.|`|XK2hy07Paa	its all about how their brains differ and how it takes women less time to process information...|`|YWb03peGaa	yes men are much more intelligent then women.

nLvJlPZ3aa	You  have to be comfortable with yourself first. Are you confident? are you happy with yourself? When you start doing that, what everyone thinks wont bother you anymore(trust me).You will look happier and they'll notice that their comments don't bother you.

vcHMNdxjaa	CORRUPTION|`|FqmXXiPsaa	Brazil population isn't so poor,actually now more than 50% of population make part of the middle class,the problem is that the media in your country only wants to show the poverty of the other countries,that's why you have such a narrow and naive point of view.   China is poorer than Brazil and you don't see people always saying they're poor,people only remember their thriving economy.     Look the slums of the underdeveloped countries,the Brazil slums is some of the less worst among these countries:http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread...

Brazil is poor but not so poor as you might think,That's for sure!!! =D|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Because Brazil is Capitalist country.|`|r3gh7ho7aa	Brazil is ranked 61 on GDP per capita.  That means, if you divide Brazil's 1.8 trillion US dollar gross domestic product by its population, you get 9700 US$ per person, per year!  Brazil is still very much undeveloped in regards to technology and infrastructure in large portions of the country, especially in central Brazil.  Its major export products, and the majority source of its high GDP, include aircraft, coffee, automobiles, soybean, iron ore, orange juice, steel, ethanol, textiles, footwear, corned beef, and electrical equipment.  As you can see, most of these are very much blue-collar jobs, involved with agriculture, and simple manufacturing.  It doesn't take much stretching of the imagination to see how a coffee planter or a sole gluer working in a shoe factory, in some obscure city no one has heard of, makes in equivalence to 9700 US$ a year in Brazil.  As in most countries, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer; Brazil is no exception.
FQ046dIsaa	You learn something about yourself when you have goals.    you are forced to exercise muscles you never knew you had! And the point of life is DO something. Be creative, experience fully what it means to know, learn, understand. Be fully yourself.    otherwise you just live like a lump. and that's a bore, frankly.    discipline will really make you a happier person. You can be proud of your accomplishment. I know I am. All the effort results in a huge amount of confidence|`|bOaqWNxRaa	I am just now beginning to learn about self discipline. I severely lack self discipline, and my life will be much improved once I learn it. Self discipline is a skill, and it's vital to have in order to live a life of passion, success, and significance.    It's important to learn self discipline, because in our society (America), we aren't ever taught how to control our impulses. That is one reason why so many people are overweight here (myself included!).    Self discipline is crucial to success. Without it, we can never live up to our full potential.
AA12219135	I looked at your previous question.  Not only was he making the transition from BF to ex BF, it appears he was making a transition to maybe another woman.  You stated he had a wandering eye. His MySpace page was full of desires to meet other women (doesn't matter if they were attainable).    -sits down in front of you-    Look, it's time for you to be a little less tolerant. I don't care what you think you look like, you need to up your self esteem a bit. No man, who truly respects the one he's with, does the wandering eye thing blatantly in front of her.  You might not want to hear this but, you have to make up your mind to be alone until you are with the one who not only wants to be with you but respects you.  Even if a man "has to look", if he's worth anything, does it respectfully as in, a quick glance. Only a moron who has no capability of photographic memory has to stare or ogle while his loved one sits idly by. Basically, he is testing to see what he can get away with by doing so.  Pick yourself up, dust off and look in the mirror. You can go without rather than put up with "settling".    You can not love someone properly if you do not love yourself.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	That's the kinda person he is =o)|`|hR1wc0taaa	sadly, this is part of the transition behavior from bf to xbf|`|OTT79NAtaa	He only wanted the sex. - As I say here everyday, this should not be a shock anymore.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Are we talking about a homo or heterosexual relationship?|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	Like the first guy said, it's possible that this is why he is ur xbf....

2mqrbxN1aa	My ex was an ex amateur boxer.  I didn't hear him say this to me for the 12 years i knew him.  I think  maybe you should read up about this on the internet and try some simple breathing techniques and at the same time telling yourself you are better than the other opponent and that you are not afraid. Capture the feeling of being unafraid whilst you feel that way, as you said it starts to fade once you start to box and visualise a bad thing to associate it with so you get more psyched up during the fight. Such as him try trying to beat up your mother or somebody you love the most. Hold that feeling and images. Practice regurgitating it as much as possible and especially when  you are about to train for your next fight. Work hard on this and make yourself remember this feeling, pinch your hand hard or something!  Hope i made a bit of sense here!  Hope you win x|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	You need to use mind control. It is something you need to practice everyday. Do some deep breathing exercises until you feel yourself get into a relaxed state. Once there, visualize yourself doing the fight in your mind. Visualize yourself being calm cool and collected and not nervous and just going right into the fight. It will take about 10 minutes out of your day and you will find yourself less and less nervous as the days go on. Visualize yourself doing the entire fight and winning.|`|tAmFjEflaa	you could find a warm up song ( you know, a song that you like so much it gets rid of your nerves), and if you don't have time for that, don't think about the fight or what you're going to do after it; think happy thoughts.|`|pvabglXhaa	Learn some really good breathing techniques that you can do when the feeling gets really bad.    You need to do something to help to focus your mind as well.  An untrained mind tends to run all over the place, especially where you don't want it to go.  Learn some mind control as well.  You could practice some yoga or check out some imaging techniques that the hypnotists use.  Putting strong pictures in your mind will really help with refocusing your thoughts where you want them to be.    You could also try some tapping techniques.  You would have to google for this type of therapy.  It works fairly well though, I used it when I gave up  smoking and it consists of tapping certain areas of your body with your fingers whenever you get in a situation you don't want to be in with your thoughts.  There are tapping classes out there, might be one near you.    Also, before the fight, go through the whole thing in your mind, from when you step into the ring all the way through to you winning the fight.  This is an extremely powerful excersise and will help you in your matches.    These are my suggestions, I wish you all the very best with your problem.

3p6wp7DYaa	I am not sure what you mean with this question. The PPF has both assumptions and characteristics... Here are the assumptions:    1. Finite resources - at any given time, the total amounts of labor, land and capital are fixed.  2. Full and efficient use of the resources - at any point along the PPF we have productive efficiency. We cannot increase the output of one good without decreasing the output of another.  3. A given state of technology - the production possibilities frontier represents the technology available to producers.    Here are the characteristics:    1. Points along the frontier show the tradeoff between two different goods for society; to get more of one, we must give up some of the other.  2. Points outside the curve are unobtainable with given resources and technology.  3. Points inside the frontier are attainable, but do not utilize society's resources efficiently.  4. The production possibilities frontier illustrates concepts of     a)Scarcity - resources are limited.  b)Choice - choices in the production of different goods need to be made.  c) Opportunity cost - to gain more of a good something else must be given up.
3p6wp7DYaa	Direct quote from Welker's Wikinomics:     "In monopoly:  P exceeds MC  P exceeds lowest ATC  an effeciency loss (dead weight loss) occurs (sum of consumer surplus + producer surplus is less than maximum)    Income transfer:  transfers income from consumers to stockholders who own monopoly  monopoly charges a higher price than a PC firm with the same costs  Can be seen as a "private tax" on consumers since the higher price generates higher economic profit that is distributed amongst shareholders of the company, who are mostly from high-income groups  owners benefit at the expense of the consumers  Since owners have more income than the consumers, monopoly increases gap between rich and poor  exception: when buyers are richer than owners of the monopoly, then income transfer from consumers to owners may decrease income inequality (usually not the case)    Cost Complications:  - A purely monopolistic industry will charge a higher price, produce a smaller output and allocate economic resoures less efficiently than a purely competitive industry assuming they have equal costs. This is because of the entry barriers that characterize monopoly.    - However, costs may not be the same for purely competitive producers and monopolistic producers: the unit cost that a monopolist has is either larger or smaller than a purely competitive firm's.     If the monopoly is achieved and sustained through anticompetitive actions, creates substantial economic inefficiency, and appears to be long-lasting, the government can file charges against the monopoly under the anti-trust laws. If found guilty of monopoly abuse, the firm can either be prohibited from engaging in certain business or be broken into two or more competing firms."|`|8qa0j0Ebaa	Usually what happens when a company is in a monopoly position (being the only dominant company within it's industry), is that they jack-up their prices that's unfair to consumers.    Clearly, this is a negative effect on the economy. As a result, the anti-trust law and among other corporate laws are reinforced by government to break up the monopoly and allow other competitors to enter within the industry without having to face predatory pricing.    Though, it is important to distinguish monopolies that are private companies and public companies. Public companies are social institutions run by the government, such as the transit system. This is a monopoloy in it's own right, but however, much different to a private monopoly - a public monopoly is created to fairly meet the needs of the community.|`|irBjTmDzaa	Perhaps, why not think in terms what is a monopoly and how does it effect business all around the nation/world for starters? Any way the first effect monopolies would have on the economy is the insufficiency on having enough goods or services produced in the nation for customers and their needs. The second effect would be in the possibility of having increased prices on a service or product because, monopolies own the entire business firm and no other corporations/conglomerates would be able to compete on a standardized level. That does not mean a monopoly can't satisfy its' customers on a daily basis. I hope this will help in any way.

nulE8zdBaa	There is nothing wrong with telling your boyfriend your dream saying: "What do you think it means?"  You will then see by his reaction where he stands. Your dreams could be simply anxiety dreams that are founded in earlier disappointments with boys.     However if you are dreaming this same or similar dream one after another you need to look at the dreams very closely. You need to read your dream plots like any other story. The best way to do this is to write your dreams down and then, later on, after a day or more, read them as if they were stories about someone else.    If in your dream other boyfriends appear, one or more of those that cheated you, you will have to look at the dream story particularly carefully since one of those old boyfriends could be a stand-in for your present one.    It seems that your relationship is not very secure; otherwise you would not spy on your boyfriend. When it is like that you had better confront him the way I suggested. If you do not confront him about this matter things will only get worse. You will get caught spying and that could spell the end of the relationship!|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	I KNOWWWW exactly what u mean samee thing happened to me a while back........its because deeep deep deep deep down ....you dont trust him......so you block it out in reality but u cant block it out in ur dreamsss.........the best thing to do is just live ....becuz if he wants to cheat he will ...so there is no point in buggin yourself about something u really have NO control over.......just live and enjoy him|`|47R03TbFaa	you have had your heart broken to many times and you are really scared that this mr. right may be mr.wrong because of it . and also your dream can be just giving you a warning about him because some dreams can Tell you the truth before you find out in person .but before you jump to any conclusions please give this man a chance and don't judge before your eggs have hatched|`|K9z6Pcw6aa	That's probably it you're just worried that he will cheat on you like all of the others.

H7kmp0qdaa	I think a lot of people who have recently gotten over loss go through these thoughts and feelings. When my best friend died, I thought I smelled him multiple times and had this feeling that I just knew he was near me. But I realized that the feelings I had were because he became a part of me through all I learned and experienced with him. I still carry him so close to my heart and know he is right here with me, but not because his literal entity is close to me, but because my heart has known love and true friendship and those deep genuine feelings are embedded in my mind and heart. I'm not sure if this will make sense to you, but I hope you find peace.

I am serious, check it out with insurance companies.  Also look at police statistics on serious accidents.  I dare you.|`|LkcJWrs6aa	Some statistics show that they can drive better than men.  It is a fact that most insurance companies charge less to insure a female driver than a male driver.    It is also a statistical fact that, for now, there are more men driving, and so, consequently, more men are responsible for car accidents than women.  Still, some insurance companies neglect that fact, and make the calculations to determine how much to charge men and women as though there were exactly the same number of each driving, which then makes men look like bad drivers because they are responsible for more car wrecks.    However, as sexism is reduced, more and more women drive every day, and there are almost as many women driving as men now.  If they really had a harder time driving, that would lead them to cause more wrecks than men, even despite that fact that male drivers outnumber them slightly.  Insurance companies would see this immediately and charge women more.  In reality, women are charged at the same rate as men, or less.

7tNL2qD5aa	In your own opinion, what is a good person? What are the personality traits that captivates your mind and soul? The answer to these questions will help you figure out who you should be like until you find your true,unique self. It is always good to have a roll-model to point yourself in the direction you see best fit but remember, your roll-models are just tools to help you find your true personality and once you do, you will either be most pleased or most disappointed. Whatever may be the case, you could always shape and sculpt your personality to become a better person in respect to your standards and all you need for that is self-discipline... There is nothing wrong with wanting  to change for the better but there is so much wrong with knowing you have to change and not doing a damn thing about it and that, I despite with passion... You've already got my approval for being better than most people, believe in yourself as I do in you :)|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	An exercise that may help with coming to terms with your physical appearance:  Lock your self in the bathroom and stand in front of the mirror in the nude. Study what you see and honestly criticize what you see out loud to yourself.  Make two lists. One of what you like and one of what you don't like. Study the list of things you don't like and divide that list into the things you have to power to change and the things you cannot. Then it is up to you accept the things that cannot be changed and find the resolve to change what you can to improve. Beating yourself up over what cannot be changed serves no good purpose. All of us have the capacity to make our own decisions for our actions: There are no victims, only volunteers. All things take practice. The more you have practiced self flagellation, the more practice you'll need in the other direction. Love is when another's well being is AS important as your own.

Any issues anybody has with any part of you are their issues and are their issues alone to deal with, their issues are not your issues and you don't have to deal with theirs. Nobody knows you the way that you know you. No two people are created equally in this life, and that's a fact of life. Create your own standards and hold yourself to your standards and your standards alone. Do whatever makes you feel happy and at peace. It doesn't matter what will make another person happy or at peace with you because only you will answer for who you are. You never answer to other people nor should you ever apologize for not meeting anybody elses standards except for your own.
jH8hIB0kaa	We are in uncharted waters. We could not spend our way out of the depression. The only way that we actually recovered was by lowering interest rates. The USA has the rates at virtually 0. This means that we have used the best tool and it has done no good. Economists are clueless in this "politically controlled economic experiment". No one is predicting a recovery in 2009.

Some wells will run dry eventually. We will need to prioritize as to what we will need to live a healthy good life, not necessarily a rich one.

"What has happened to America, the destruction of what was recently the most powerful economy in the world could not have happened without the complicity of politicians of both parties who aided the bankers in their parasitic plundering of Americas wealth, productivity and future.|`|nN2adUyYaa	the economy has to get better sometime. take the great depression, for example. i guess for now all we can do is try to look for the good in this bad situation|`|dogVckqbaa	I hope so I will be 18 after next year and I want to have a job to support myself.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	It will not recover if they keep throwing kerosene on the fire. The way Obama has been handling the situation with more bailouts, more stimulus packages, and more social programs, this will go on for a long time. A worst case scenario is that all this new money being created can cause the collapse of the dollar....    If they let the debt be liquidated, sure we'd be in a recession for a little bit and it would hurt and we would have to tighten our belts but we could go back to being prosperous. Unfortunately our government feels that big government is the only way to go.
Yd2PAS21aa	Absolutely not.  A  lot of guys in my grade read Twilight, mostly because their gfs read them and they're curious what all the hubub is about. (they probably wouldn't admit it but I bet they like them).    But seriously! I know personally several boys who read Twilight, but most are just afraid to because its classified as a "chick book" just because it has romance and isn't all blast-your-head-off-action-gore stuff.  The writing is fantastic! I am not sure if it is you or some one you know; if it's you, then be proud and read that book because it's darn good! And if it's somebody you know then lay off.  I personally think it is amazingly  cool that a guy would read Twilight.|`|GXuMzAuQaa	no
2f4qTCciaa	Being mean to people is fine, just not too mean like harsh.  Care for him, say hi and how are you, then start a conversation (ask questions that find out more about him), then decide if you still like him or if he like you now. (don't approach him too much, prefer him to approach you after your first or second try)|`|K6fasl6kaa	you need to apologize.  it will remind you of the lesson you learned.  if you keep screwing up , keep apologizing.  you will be forgiven and seen as a better person if you do.  treat others as you would like to be treated.  i can see that you want to be a good person and not hurt other people's feelings.  some habits take time to break.  it is not all your fault if you were allowed or encouraged in this behavior when you were small.  what counts is from this day forward.  kindness is free to give and freely returned.  my best wishes to you.|`|9189a5150c78e5bb8152c39d8f0d1579aa	maybe when you were younger somebody treated you badly|`|6ZRF1jW4aa	You sound like a sociopath. But it's cool. I'm the same way. I just turned it into an asset by being on The Awful Show.|`|o67XytP2aa	wow heres some help talk to ur parents or like a counselor|`|WeNWlYT4aa	You hate yourself, and you don't want anyone to know how ugly you are inside so when anyone tries to connect emotionally you do whatever works best to push them away.|`|YNPNfbf8aa	youre shy but dont want to show it or you like peoplto much to be nice  to them dont go up to them and apoligive|`|9FrBtCfDaa	talk to some people who have been nice to you in the past, peers who could be friends. and ask them to hang out. tell them your problem and ask them to smack you upside the head whenever you offend them. if you don't know what you did wrong, ask. you will learn how to be nice eventually.|`|XLviqEynaa	look if you do not show your anger you face will be ungly with.. to horble to say. it cause stress. and i makes you fat if you do not|`|gPvhZDI7aa	hmm sounds like u have anger issues or something. i would go to counseling if its that bad. if not, try holding the door open for him or other people, say please and thankyou when talking. like if you have to use the bathroom during class, be like "mrs.....may i please use the bathroom?" and just be really polite and then he will probablly warm up to you again. also you can compliment him, be like you look really nice today!|`|JBj3B5y0aa	stop being mean...being laid back and easy going is the way to go|`|Ja3kboliaa	That's what's wrong with me.    I know that at times i can be annoying. People could just not like you for a personal reason. But if you don't know them it's probably what they hear people say about you or first impressions.|`|x28X2Ch1aa	You can just go up to him and apologize, that's the beauty of freedom. first of all it's great that you're recognizing you're *problem* if you want to call it that.  alot of people don't want to see the reality of things and think there's anything wrong with themselves...i don't think there's anything wrong with you, maybe somethin happenedto you in the past and you're taking it out on people because of confusion.  I don't know how old you are or what you circumstances are but if you want to talk to this guy again just go up to him and explain to him that you didn't mean to be the way you were. he'll really appreciate your honesty and courage coming up to him (if he's any kind of man anyway lol).  just remember to be grateful for the things you have (your health, friends, a family, a normal life) and you'll start to notice a change :)|`|iYRDg9r5aa	Well first its good to recognize that you're mean. If you acted this way as a child its probably something you picked up from your parents, or some other influence, but now that your older you need to recognize when you are being mean and just tell your self to relax. Simple self control exercises can really help reduce frustration or irritation you feel towards others. And if all else fails maybe you should see a psychiatrist, if only to have someone to listen to you while you vent and then give you some professional advice. :) Hope this helps|`|VZFEB85Iaa	People in school probably think your a b*tch... :P  anyway, i know what u mean >  i'm mean except only to my dad lol.  he just pisses me off and idk why.  i feel guilty afterwards but i just.. i just 'cant' stop.  haha.    My advice is to just be funny in class and stuff and yeah.  Make people laugh.  They'll be friends with you.  If you make people laugh, you get that good feeling inside and maybe you'll just let go of your attitude and start being nice.|`|dxYgLvEBaa	Social is to connect. Anti-social is to disconnect. Being mean simply means to be anti-social and it is a problem when you use it as a tool for the wrong job and expect the job done. Now wake up.|`|jIkaapKQaa	Well you can start by apologizing.  Apologies need not be through the word 'sorry' all the time.  You can make amends by helping out.  You can help your parents or friends whatever you can.  And think twice before opening your mouth so that you won't have to hurt someone.    I used to be like that too.  But as I matured, I learned to handle things more properly.    We all do have regrets of what we've done, but it's too late, what we can do now is move forward.    As for that guy, just let him be.  Do things right and perhaps some day he'll see that you are not who you were then.  Just don't insist on patching things up right now.  You're right, you did mess things up. Don't try to apologize, instead show him indirectly that you are approachable.|`|A1mln67Aaa	Give yourself credit for acknowledging the issue.    The first and most crucial requirement for change is self awareness.    Now re-think your comments.   You can go back to this guy and apologize.   Telling yourself that you can't is just another wall you put up all by yourself.   You built the wall, you can tear it down.   If he accepts your sincere apology, then you can celebrate with him.    If he does not, at least you tried.    Don't be afraid of rejection.   You screwed up.  Accept his rejection (he is shy and has issues accepting an apology) and move on with your life.   Let it be a small reminder to not be mean to the next guy you are attracted to.|`|iEVwHmchaa	u kant help screwing it up kanu. shutup nd stop being a ****** biche. nd u say ur pretty and funny. ugh stop boasting|`|0XWVUMCAaa	just breathe and be calm  maybe you should write that  guy a note instead of apologizing in person|`|CaYBmaN3aa	How are you being mean?   When you answer that question, stare at the answer and see what you can do to stop doing it. And if the guy you like is shy and avoiding you, go apologize to him.  Hope this helps!!|`|ko81Laeraa	well first start out slow, ask them their opnions about things. Ask what movie they want to see, try putting the effort to see what other people want, and think about what you say before you say it. As for the boy, i know how you feel i screwed up things with a guy that liked me a couple weeks ago, sadly i couldn't fix things but if it was something simple, try asking him to a movie say your sorry for the way you acted you knew it was wrong or something of that sort. If it's really really bothering you try going to therapy. But try opening doors for people, smile at the old guy walking down the street, be more social. I'm a very nice person, but i wasn't alwyas that way, when i was a child i was very mean to my friends, also very selfish. The good thing it that you realize it that means you can fix it, tell a really good friend that you want to change, become a better person and they can help you, maybe they can give you looks when you say something mean when in a group of friends. I wish you the best of luck.|`|0130c3c117e6a2c8b253b28f90c90038aa	You may not want to hear this but I would suggest that you don't go after the boy right now. I think you need some time for self reflection. I would try a few things:  1) take some times to determine what you want your life to be like and surround yourself with people who reflect that. Maybe once you see each person as someone who is helping you reach a goal maybe you will be more likely to be nice.  2) also maybe read some books that will give you hints on how to improve your communication and social skills. I know it may seem crazy to get self help books but 1 week of reading may change your entire life.   3) Get a buddy to help you evaluate how much progress you are making. Take their feedback seriously.|`|CRDc8Qe3aa	It sounds like you have very little contentment and peace. However, I am confident you can change because you recognize there is a problem and are taking steps to correct it - for one by asking advice.    We all have a "core" personality from birth but can overcome negative feelings and attitudes that create social problems, like anger. Make a firm decision that you will change and put forth all your effort and your friends and family will notice and reinforce your progress.    It is necessary to determine the root of the problem. What is the cause of your problem? Do you fear rejection or feel inadequate? There's probably some deceptive burden you carry that must be  identified and overcome (prayer helps me). My suggestion is you seek out a counselor to help you find the root of the problem and diligently work to conquer it. You can do more than just hide negative feelings and behavior. You can make it all fade away and have peace of mind.    Make a list of the good qualities you have and dwell on these things.   If you can't go up to him and apologize maybe you can write him a short letter about how you really feel. And if he rejects you, so what?  Do your part to make things right and don't be discouraged if things don't change immediately. You've been drained, maybe overwhelmed, by this problem so it's worth going through some discomfort ito be free. I already know there's an end to your storm. Just keep trying and don't give up. When things begin to change you will likely value your peace more than others and will also have a knowledge and the  experience that comes only through hardship. You can do it.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	You've only got a few decades left tops then you'll be dead you don't have any time to waste being mean to people.|`|m3iPgBWFaa	JUST STOP BEING MEAN!!! IDK WHAT OTHER ANSWER THERE IS|`|Jl9QAVAYaa	think before you act    you're prolly mean because ur nervous and thats how you react without thinking|`|berYSEW7aa	hmmmm....maybe thats just your personality......try a brain transplant  ;)|`|SFoMSEpgaa	You have already taken the first step...|`|ZxdQQpbEaa	I feel like that sometimes too, like I think in my mind I'm being nice to people and then later I'll look back at it and I'll think wtf is wrong with me, why am I such a dick sometimes lol. Idk, what I'm doing is just thinking before I say and do things, and putting myself in other people's shoes before doing saying or doing them because sometimes they can misinterpret those things. Its working out well so far, good luck!|`|S6WRVfcOaa	people suck. keep on being mean.|`|324cdd2706638f6d6bf41b469c741e8caa	did you ever try, i don't know, NOT being mean? just be extra nice to him next time you see him. he'll get it that you're sorry|`|595BQdO8aa	God! God will change u! God is love and love is real!  he is the only way that ur heart will open up! Except Jesus ad ur savior and give ur life to God and ur life will change! and all that hatred and evrything else will go away! =]|`|AA12108398	you need to learn from watching other people. talk to your parents ask them what to do, you might not want their advice but it could change you life. apologize for your behavior, no matter how embarrassing it may be. talk to this boy again and tell him you want to change, maybe he'll help.    if you need anything else please visit my website frighteningtruth.webs.com/    happy to help:)|`|UtTv0we8aa	I know this sounds cheesy but think before you say stuff. Just always focus on being nice like almost too nice and eventually you will just start being nice on your own. If you do slip up and are mean to someone just apologise right away and continue being nice. - Thats what I would do anyway.|`|mHGvAc9kaa	If he's shy then you ask him   a qusten he has to answer (like birth stone idk....) then you can have a conversation with him. Be way nice. And if you guys get closer then say  sorry I was a jerk, I had a bad day. Try to slowy build down your "wall"  Good Luck :) Hope I helped
ZOXoPgJbaa	no they are different. one is the marginal propensity to consume. the other is the marginal propensity to save.   your total income is 100%    if your MPC is 75%  then your MPS is 25%.|`|a71e1d190c16e2a5b566d5670e23bc31aa	In balance yes.
p9DW7iRfaa	No. Let's just take a look at an impact calculus.    Most basic and primal statistic: Unemployment. During the 1930s, unemployment amongst able adults was at a low of about 27%. Now, in our economic recession, unemployment is at 6%.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	yes & yes|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	it could be worse.  yes it is a possibility that he could loose his job in this economic crisis.  Just as likely as anyone else.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Yes, it could get worse. The reason it would be worse is because the population of this country is more than what it was in the 1930's, way more.    People who lived back then, the majority used to live off the land. They were ranchers and grew their own food. Now everyone depends on stores for their food. The day that people walk into supermarkets and find the shelves empty, there will be total chaos.     Im stocking up on non perishables and ammunition as we speak.|`|qiVE00ecaa	no, we will recover like we always and your dad will not lose his job because retirement companies aren't gonna make any job cuts.  Besides, the worst is over.|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	yes and yes|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	It could be much worse than the great depression, because this time we might have a dollar crisis, depending on if the new money that has been created actually hits the economy. But yes Obama's policies arent making it any better. We need to be liquidating debt at this point and saving, but he is doing the opposite, he is just piling on more debt.     Dont listen to A. Wolf , our unemployment is closer to 8 percent, but if they measured unemployment the way they did during the depression, it would be much closer to 16 or 17 %.    If you would like to understand economics, and be up to date on what is really going on, instead of listening to the propaganda on the television you should check out    http://www.mises.org  http://www.lewrockwell.com|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	No, it will be worse.There you have an example, your dad can lose his job,millions of men will face unemployment as jobs are being destroyed at a pace of 75,000 a day.This will destroy millions of families.Capitalists are against the concept of Family.|`|WeNWlYT4aa	What a preposterous question.|`|3PfkXTouaa	it could happen. then all hell will break lose.|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	It could possibly get that bad, although not in exactly the same ways.  For example, unemployment could keep rising to 1920s levels, but it is unlikely that too many people would have their savings entirely wiped out by bank failures.    As for you dad, it's just not possible to tell, as it more depends on his specfic company, salary, benefits, boss, etc., then on the economy in general.  I think everyone is in at least a little danger of losing their jobs, although many people are very safe.   Ask him if you're worried--parents should understand that children (i'm assuming your a child or teen, apologies if you're not) are concerned about the economy and their families.  Maybe you'll even be able to work together to make sure your family is as strong as possible in this crisis, which would really keep/bring you close together.|`|zIkWaYlCaa	Yeah. If it already isn't as bad. Think about it this way. Back then something around 25% of the country was out of a job, and now today it's around 7%, but overtime the population has grown tremendously so about the same number of people are out of a job that were back during the Great Depression now. And the situation we are having now is only supposed to grow, so yeah it is as bad as the Great Depression was. But as for your dad i have no clue. It's usually whoever lucks out. But good luck.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Anyone that answers this question is guessing.We are in uncharted waters. We could not spend our way out of the depression. The only way that we actually recovered was by lowering interest rates. The USA has the rates at virtually 0. This means that we have used the best tool and it has done no good. Economists are clueless in this "politically controlled economic experiment". No one is predicting a recovery in 2009. The "best of the best" economic experts can not begin to call this one. It is a day by day view when politicians play with the economy. Sorry for the long answer, but this is reality for now.|`|lz6vAjSEaa	meteors could crash down...maybe|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Industrial and Technical Economics present model scenarios of wealth accrual.  A few elite corporate executives and government leaders are ahead of the curve on the extent of potential national wealth.  This close knit group the "Leadership Class' can influence a general slowdown in production.     In this respect the conditions are similar.  In reality the level of wealth is astronomically greater.      Witness the escalation of  necessary spending:    AIG Bailout $85 Billion  TARP $700 Billion  Economic Stimulus Bill $819 Billion    The other common theme is the lack of Industrial and Technical Economics education and knowledge of many elected officials and voters.  People most effected by the adversity must rely on the expertise of business and government leadership.|`|4Ps1LBvoaa	"could"? more like is and is getting worse.|`|6Bg9eeyBaa	Yeah it could get worse. But don't worry always hope for the best.

ZOXoPgJbaa	They really are not. Please tell your teacher tomorrow, that he/she should stop with their keynesian propaganda and start teaching real economics, aka the austrian school.     The effects of inflation are you and I paying higher prices for goods.    Inflation is the inflation of the money supply, which then gets reflected into prices of goods. They try to force you to see inflation as inflation of prices, but that is just the of the rise of m0, m1, m2, and m3.     heres a great article for you to get a better understanding.    http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=276...
