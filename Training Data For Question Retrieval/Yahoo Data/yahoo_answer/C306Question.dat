20090304053401AAYHCMr	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls only...please :)?	I am very shy and just wandering.  I didn't want any guys to make fun of me for being a virgin.  Is it OK for a guy to want to wait?  Would you date a guy who wanted to wait?  I like to kiss and flirt.  I am just a little scared and would like to wait until  I get more comfortable being with a girl.  I am 20 and I haven't been around many girls (I have only kissed 2 and that was this year).  I just want to make sure I find the right girl before we do the dirty.  Why is it so hard for a guy like me to find a girl to go out with?  I try to ask (which is really hard for me to do to begin with), but they just shoot me down.  I hope I am not a creep.  I am a real small town southern man-very polite and outspoken.  I am giving and caring.  I like kissing.  :) I would take her to a nice restaurant, dance whatever.  I am not the best dancer, but I would give it my damnedest just to make her happy.  I have my faults, I will admit.  I have the worst habit of making assumptions and I am really working hard on it.  I try not to be desperate.  Help please?

But before the man was able to speak he had to pull the parachute, and the jeanie said, "Too bad, I only do this with those who are falling, and you only get one shot in your entire life. Bye." The man landed on the ground safely, but he went home very sad because he didn't get to do the wishes. Then he eventually died.

20090304102601AAmqJnj	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Can you name a movie that has TWO climaxes?	I decided to make ask this question because I'm executing my movie ideas, and I noticed that one of my screenplays actually has two climaxes.      In a movie, a climax is the final sequence where there the main character's motives/conflicts are at such a high focus that once the confrontation is over, you think the movie is over.   The second important thing about a climax is that it always puts the movie's main plot at stake (but you still have to think that the movie is over once the sequence is over). Some people are probably going to say that each of the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies has two climaxes, but that is not true at all. It should be obvious that the movie's climax doesn't happen until Marty is about to go back to 1985, and anything that happens after that is just a wrap-up.      I'll start off by naming a few movies:      1- "The Dark Knight" ... [One climax is in the first half of the movie, and the second climax is the 2nd-to-last confrontation. Both my brother and my 12-year-old cousin watched the movie on separate occasions(1 in theaters, 2 on DVD), and they both asked to leave after the first climax because they thought the movie was over.]      2- "Godzilla" (the 98 movie) ... [A lot of people should already know the story behind this one.]      3- "Alien Vs. Predator" (the first movie) ... [You should read Paul Anderson's screenplay. It makes it more clearer than it already is.]      4- "Mulan" ... [A lot of people should understand this one too.]      So can anyone else name a movie that has two climaxes and explain why both the final sequences have the right to be considered climaxes?      One final note:   Finding Nemo does NOT have two climaxes (if you plan on counting the confrontation with Darla, and then the net escape at the fishing grounds). During the showdown with Darla, Nemo is suddenly sent down a drain as the sequence ends, making clear that he is not dead, which is what his father believes, and Nemo still has an objective to accomplish. So after the sequence in the dentist's office, audience knows that the movie is not over and there is still a resolution to come.   I just thought I should make that clear, since the movie has a lot of fanboys who like to call both sequences climaxes.

I was very young when I first saw the movie so I don't remember much. I remember it was on my parents Beta (yes, the dinosaur version of the vhs) and it involved a young man being sucked into an alternate world where there was a battle between the good dragons and the bad dragons. There might have been an evil lord and a chess board in one scene? And a sick princess? Oh, and at the end when the man returned home, some chick from the other world with blonde hair down to her knees followed him and they lived happily ever after.      Please someone tell me I'm not crazy. None of my siblings remember the movie and its been bugging me something fierce.

Why do overlook and oversee mean opposite things?      11. Why isn't the number 11 pronounced onety one?      12. 'I am' is reportedly the shortest sentence in the English language.   Could it be that 'I do' is the longest sentence?      13.

What hair colour do they put on the driver' licences of bald men?      15.

You never really learn to swear until you learn to drive.      18. No one ever says, 'It's only a game' when their team is winning.      19. Ever wonder about those people who spend two pound a piece on those   little bottles of Evian water?      Try spelling Evian backwards:      20. Isn't making a smoking section in a restaurant like making a peeing   section in a swimming pool?      22. If 4 out of 5 people SUFFER from diarrhoea, does that mean that 1   enjoys it?         23. Why if you send something by road it is called a shipment, but when   you send it by sea it is called cargo?      24.

People Lack intelligence and like to live through intelligent music vicariously (Basically, You're stupid and use intelligent music to feel smart)      2. Intelligent people like intelligent music.      What are your thoughts? Is it cool to expect a k.o.s. lesson from every track you hear?

20090304115447AAZDAv2	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Wednesday evenings funny joke.?	A wealthy couple prepared to go out for the evening. The woman of the house gave their butler, Buddy, the night off. She said they would return home very late, and she hoped he would enjoy his evening.       The wife wasnt having a good time at the party. So, she came home early, alone. Her husband stayed on, socializing with important clients. As the woman walked into her house, she found Buddy by himself in the dining room.       She called him to follow her, and led him into the master bedroom.   She turned to him and said, in the voice she knew he must obey.       "Buddy, I want you to take off my dress." This he did, hanging it carefully over a chair.       "Buddy," she continued, "now take off my stockings and garter belt." Again, Buddy silently obeyed.       "Now, Buddy, I want you to remove my bra and panties." Eyes downcast, Buddy obeyed.       Both were breathing heavily, the tension mounting between them. She looked sternly at him and said, "Buddy, if I ever catch you wearing my stuff again, youre fired!"

You know who I mean.. the (usually ancient) drivers that totally refuse to drive over 35-40 mph even on a safe wide,main road.   They are totally oblivious to the mile-long 'snake' of tailbacked traffic that forms behind them.They are the ones that will stick behind a tractor doing 20mph rather than overtake,causing others to overtake more than one vehicle to get past(OK if you've got a Porsche or Subaru but more dangerous for slower vehicles).   If anyone does overtake them they don't like it and flash their lights.   The 35-40 speed is even adhered to even through a 30mph limit.   Am I the only one that these 'accident causers' gets on their nerves?

Years ago (prior to 2005) I remember a very cute series of Yahoo! commercials...       the three I keep thinking of but cannot find are      1.) A pierced-up, tattooed punk is crocheting, and his friend laugh at him. he goes onto Yahoo! and hooks up with a group of knitting hotties.      2.) There is a man with a crow, and his partner leaves him. He goes to Yahoo! Personals and meets a woman with a monkey that throws food to the crow. or maybe he has the monkey-i've forgotten.      3.) There is a meteor entering the earth's atmosphere. A radio reports that it will make contact in an unpopulated area of the Australian Outback. Unfortunately, there IS one settler there, and he goes on Yahoo! and orders lots of pillows. He covers his little trailer and his adorable Australian Cattle Dog with the pillows to protect them from the pebble-sized meteorite!      this is my all-time favorite commercial...

I cannot find anywhere else. Thank you!

20090304123604AAmIxA4	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is it with Hollywood and remaking classic movies?	Yours, Mine, and Ours, Cheaper by the Dozen, Halloween, Halloween 2(it's in the process of being made), Friday the 13th, and now, Nightmare on Elm Street(Robert Englund IS Freddy, it won't seem like Nightmare on Elm Street without him).      These movies may be old, but they are great movies, and shouldn't be remade.   So much money is being wasted on these remakes.   Some remakes were good, though.   Is Hollywood that uncreative now?      What's next, remake Scream that was only made in 1996?   My theory is that they KNOW people will go see these movies to compare them to the originals, so that they get a lot of money at the box office.   I have seen all of the originals & remakes of the movies I listed, so I can compare them.   I'd like some opinions on this.

When Cane and Lily drop by to see Delia, Jill's thrilled to see Lily wearing the familiar pendant necklace - and to hear they're back together. She then has to deliver bad news - Chloe's taken the baby and moved in with Billy.       Up bright and early, Jack comments on the little 'opera singer'. Chloe apologizes for keeping him up last night (but appreciates his help). Since Billy never showed up last night, Chloe's 'this close' to packing up and going back to her Mom's. Billy didn't answer his cell all night. There he is now, Jack hears the door - but it's just Ashley come to gush over the baby.      11 messages? really? Billy frowns at his cell as he tip toes out of Sharon's suite - and in the hallway, plays several messages from Chloe that that go from a curious where are you - to an irritated where are you - then finally an angry where are you!?       Chloe pours coffee and joins Jack and Ashley fussing over Delia - Dad would have loved her. She's SO gorgeous, Ash praises. She's sort of been in her shoes - get it sorted out while Delia's still a baby. We're going to live in the pool house together, Chloe states. Ash gently suggests Billy's not ready to settle down - she might be setting herself up for disappointment.       In hat and glasses, Gloria sneaks onto the patio, then hushes Jana up when she squeals her name in delight. Incognito, Glo complains of the press hounding her - then hisses at the rumpled looking Kevin not to blow her cover. Jana gripes about Kevin having been 'at it' all night - the woman he insists is Katherine has gone missing. Having checked seedy motels for the past 15 hours, Kev doesn't know what to do next. How about work, Jana reminds they BOTH own this place (but she's the only one working). Kevin apologizes - but is just bummed - so sure that Mrs C is out there.       How the hell did she track me here!? Clint growls about Amber to Kay and Ester (who are now tied sitting on the bed). Boasting that she got rid of them, Annie's puts an arm around Roger - she's on HIS side. Shut up! Clint bellows - this thing is getting too hot - it's time to pull the plug. Roger agrees - but what do we do with these two? Kay and Ester exchange a worried look.       Ashley shows Chloe how to wrap Delia tightly - and will come back any time to give her tips. If I'm here, Chloe reminds. Jack's sure she will be - and that Billy's 'totally committed'. He's likely just packing. Sure Jack will watch the baby while Chloe takes a shower. What are you trying to sell that poor girl? Ash snaps - you're making promises Billy won't be able to keep.       At the penthouse, Billy relaxes on the sofa for about a minute when he checks his ringing cell. Chloe - yay, he mutters as he tosses the cell - and closes his eyes looking exhausted and depressed.   They're gonna kill us - it's all my fault, Ester's panic is shushed by Kay - you're NOT to blame. Let me try again, Ester begs - don't hurt Mrs C. I know - I'll go to Nikki Newman. Forget it, Clint won't let her out again. Now stop it! Ester whimpers about not being able to see her little Kate and Delia again. Kay hisses to Ester - have faith - people are looking for us.      As Kevin insists to the skeptical Gloria that it IS Mrs C, Jana now doesn't believe it either - let it go. Kevin won't - and will prove it IS Mrs C. When Gloria makes a crack about polyester, Kevin flashes back to a jacket he saw in the motel room - one he recalls Mrs C wearing. Mom - you're a genius, he exclaims - then races out to make a phone call.       Back in the Abbott dining room, Ashley and Jack complain about Gloria getting out of prison. Mike may have won this round - but Gloria WILL pay - if only monetarily. Jack stuns Ash by suggesting they drop the civil suit. Have you lost your mind!? she yelps.      At CL's, Gloria wonders what she said that got Kevin all riled up - while Jana, head in hands, rubs her temples. 'It IS her' a couple of customers eye Gloria - then approach to call her a murderer.

I've been searching for the name of a song and who it is by, for a very very very long time.. and I have no results. So maybe someone on here knows this song. I only know two lines of the lyrics and I don't think it is the correct wording.    LYRICS:      ....and she said "How did you know? That's my favorite song"....   ....now the rooms spinning and the clocks ticking....         that's all I can remember and I'm positive those aren't the exact words. I heard this song about three or four years ago because my sister was singing it.. and unfortunately I cannot ask her what it was. But the band might be similar to fall out boy, panic at the disco, hellogoodbye, etc.  Well.... thanks(:

OK so I was in the bank but I could only hear a few of the lyrics because I was surrounded by LOUD NOISES (said in a steve carrel voice)      anyways here are the clues to the song that i heard.    1. It is a chic singing (with a beautiful voice)   2. some of the lyrics go something like - I sit and have a drink while I am running out of ink. (seriously it could be a little bit different than that) another verse is - I ___ ____ ____ wonder when someone will take me away(she said something that ryhmed with away). Then I think this is part of the chorus where she repeats "sadder days" over and over. Honestly it may even be "saturday". but anyways i must know this song. PLEASE HELP ME i will be lost if i dont get to listen to it again.      p.s. she song the song with i think just a guitar playing, it was beautiful and she sung it in a melodic kinda way.

I have just finished writing my first movie at this time I am casting for my movie and also accepting original music lyrics and songs for the score of the movie and sound track. I wish to pay each actor actress producer and artist for their work. But I can not  afford to pay anyone for their participation at this time or at the end of filming. I want to make aware to all of whom take part in the filming of my movie they will be compensated depending on the success of the film. Meaning if my movie earn a certain amount of money in the tens of thousands then actors extras producers and artist will be compensated without question. Also I would like the contract to read that all music songs and lyrics submitted must be original and have copy writes. Because my film company will not be responsible for any stolen material and by submitting your song music or lyrics you are giving permission for your works to be used in the film.

20090304133629AAesJ2f	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have you ever placed a bet ?	A little old lady went into the Bank of Canada one day, carrying a bag of money. She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, “It’s a lot of money!” After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her to the president’s office(the customer is always right)! The bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit.   She replied, “$165,000!” and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk.   The president was of course curious as to how she came to get this money. He asked, “how did you get this money?”   The old lady replied, “I make bets.”   The president then asked, “Bets? What kind of bets?”   The old woman said, “Well, for example, I’ll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.”   “Ha!” laughed the president. “That’s a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!”   The old lady challenged, “So, would you like to take my bet?”   “Sure,” said the president. “I’ll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!”   The little old lady then said, “Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me at 10:00 am as a witness?”   “Sure!” replied the confident president. That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning them from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.   The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president’s office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: “$25,000 says the president’s balls are square!” The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.   “Well, Okay.” said the president. “$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.” Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.   The president asked the old lady, “What the hell’s the matter with your lawyer?”   She replied, “Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that by 10:15 am today, I’d have The Bank of Canada’s president’s balls in the palm of my hand.”

20090227071611AAWzeN0	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	About Katherine Chancellor's DNA test on Y&R?	I did not see the whole episode a week or more ago, I saw a scene where Jill was in the Coffee Shop or somewhere and said that 'the DNA was not from her mother" and the note was found at Murphy's that said she was not Katherine.\      Did I miss a scene where the actual DNA evidence was delivered or called in?       Could it really be Marge and not Katherine? Or is Jill not Katherine's daughter? (I know we had the scene at Katherine's funeral where Marge's ghost was walking around and all, but this is not "Ghost Whisperer")      But basically, were those 2 scenes the only ones they said she was not Katherine, and was Jill's DNA the only thing they compared her DNA with?

20090304140917AA0hoa1	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Star Trek Voyager question?	Hey thanks to netflix I was able to go back and watch all the episodes. There were several I had never seen or only had caught parts of. Last night I watched "EndGame" bringing my months of enjoyment of Voyager to an end. Just curious if anyone in the Trek Universe wrote any books on what happened to the crew once they got home?  I mean EndGame gave us ideas as to what may have happened had the original time line gone through. However that time line was erased when Voyager made it back to the Alpha quadrant thanks to Admiral Janeway. I know that Voyager ended about 10 years ago but I have more time on my hands now. So any help would be great! Especially if there are good books about what happened and ones that stink. Ten big points to the best advice. "Live Long and Prosper"

One night, during one of their rendezvous, she confided in him that she was pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to have the child. If she stayed in Italy, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but wondered how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to mail him a post card, and write "Spaghetti" on the back. He would then arrange for child support.       One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife.    "Honey," she said, "you received a very strange post card today."    "Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later," he said. The wife obeyed, and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted.       On the card was written..."Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Two with meatballs, one without.

Heads or Tails    The blonde reported for her university final examination that consists of "yes/no" type questions.

20090227071705AAb2m78	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I saw a vampire movie decades ago when I was a child.  Anyone know what it might be?	My memory of the movie is vague at this point, but it was one of the first "horror" movies I saw and I didn't find it scary at all, mostly intriguing and I would love to see it again and see if I still think it's any good.      The little that I remember of it involved a woman who came to find out that her father was basically the head vampire.  I don't remember if his character was Dracula or not.  Everything else is really vague at this point, almost like a dream I woke up from and can't quite recall.  I think there were "bad" vampires who wanted to kill her and/or her father in order to take over.  Maybe there had been some sort of a medallion.  I think it was something her father gave her.  Perhaps a cross, even, though I'm stretching at this point.      Basically the only thing I'm sure of was that she didn't know who her father was and some time before the end of the movie she learned he was a vampire.      I know it's vague, but any suggestions would be appreciated.

20090304144647AACTrYF	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Question about the Sun in the 12 house?	From what I have read about the sun in 12 house it is concerned with alienation and searching of self together with a lack of leadership needs. However, although I have my sun in the 12 house, I don't feel like I should stay "behind the scenes" and "contemplate life". Yes, I need time alone just to recharge my batteries, but I love being around people. So, my question is : Is the sun's power in the 12 house rather diminished by other factors? For instance, can mars and mercury in 1 house indicate assertiveness and ambition rather than withdrawal (12-house sun)? And what about Jupiter in 11 house which is concerned with friends and socializing? Just to mention in my case mars makes sextile with jupiter and mercury makes sextile with jupiter as well. Mercury and Mars are in conjunction. My sun and ascendant are in leo and there is a conjunction between the ascendant and the sun. I'd be really thankful if you share some opinion :)
20090304145636AAshDtb	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Does anybody know any good sax tunes?	I'm getting really into Saxohphone music but can't find anything I like right now. I'm looking for the chilled out, LA, Las Vegas casino/club kind of music. Kind of blues style. I don't really know how to explain it.    If you've ever seen the movie Casino with Robert De Niro, you may understand what I mean..      Also, it would be great if it had hardly any or no vocals in. But if there is some that's ok. The artist I've been listening to at the moment is Sade. And she's really good.

And why do they stick the word "AMERICAN" in -front of everything?? AMERICAN wife-swap, AMERICAN Idol...is it incase they forget?   These things do so baffle me!
