My wife and I are preparing to purchase our first home using an FHA loan with assistance from her CalPERS retirement savings.  We have decided to purchase a home we can afford on only one income so we don't have to worry about the recession and losing a job.  By herself she qualifies for $350k and we have plenty of homes in our area for under $350k.      I would like someone to explain to me what the major differences are between REO homes, Short Sale homes, Foreclosure homes.  Which one is the best deal usually and which one should we look into buying?        We want something that is clean and ready to move into with little or no work needed.  Also, which one of the three is more likely to cover the closing costs???  We keep hearing about how sellers are paying closing costs most of the time in this housing market.  I want to get a great deal and avoid paying 100% of the closing costs if we can.      Thank you

I also have the skills and background.      For the first interview. I met wtih 4 people and was there for a little over 2 hours. I had a positive feeling in my gut when I left. One thing though, the hiring person had to get cut short because she got an important conference call. So I didn't spend as much time with her as the others. I believe the other interviews were positive, but I think she holds the cards.      The guy I would work directly for told me to think about some factors about the company because I will need to be comfortable with them. He said he had to become comfortable with those issues too and he just started. He implied I was going to have further contact with them and the process.      Does this sound promising and does it mean something when you meet 4 people in the first interview? There are 7 people total on the team.

I moved to Arizona in late April of 2008 and my boyfriend wanted to claim myself and my son on his taxes for 08-09.  When we recieved our taxes the government only gave us about half and left out the EIC because last year my boyfriend didn't claim as head of household or have any dependents, and now all of a sudden he has two dependents.. which I understand, the government wants to make sure nobody is trying to claim someone falsely or whatever.. but now the government is telling us we need to send them proof that my son has lived here for the whole year but I'm not sure as to what exactly I need?  They sent a letter but it doesn't give enough details and my sons pediatrician gave me a few copies of some paperwork but I don't think it's going to be accepted because for one, it doesn't have any dates of him being seen or receiving any shots until around September of 08, so if that was his 'first' visit then technically that paper only says that he has lived here around 6/7 months.. the pediatrician also told me that when they tried to give a letter to other patients' parents, with their letterhead & information on it that for some reason the government rejected the letter so I guess that it isn't accepted, even though on the paper it states that it should be??... I'm just so confused and we need our taxes back but I just feel like I'm jumping through hoops for nothing.. does anyone know exactly what would work or be accepted as proof for my boyfriends EIC?  My current boyfriend is not my sons father, but he's been taking care of both of us for the past year.. I'm just at ends right now and if anyone has any suggestions I'm more than willing to listen.. I'm going to try calling the IRS and see if they can't give me more detailed information but I have a feeling that I'm not going to get too far.. thank you in advance for any help or suggestions.      Also, would a letter from the state be accepted? I and my son both receive medical benefits from the state and I thought if the copies of medical papers wouldn't work, then surely something from the STATE would be accepted, yes?

He was asked to alter the resignation to the end of next month instead of the 12 weeks he gave the company (which is in his contract). He did change it and said that he agreed to leave at the end of the month.   Thinking about it he feels that they have possibly tried to manipulate the situation and he didn't have time to think about the implications.   I've suggested he attempt to retract his resignation. I cant seem to find any laws on the web about retracting your resignation. He has spoken to the HR lady and explained how he felt and has now emailed her to confirm that he would like to retract his resignation. I dont know if he still wants to work there or not but know that he wants to give three months notice. So can anyone help??

Con eso del redondeo, y los comerciales que salen en la tele de "Tengo que decir sí al redondeo"... casi nunca compro en supermercados, así que no me preocupa realmente... pero me llegó esta información:      *Ayer en un centro comercial, Soriana para ser exactos, mi padre redondeó su  cuenta, algo un tanto insignificante y una práctica muy común en todos y cada uno de los centros comerciales del país, en el ticket de compra  aparecía redondeo 85 centavos; mas lo que despertó mi instinto, mi  instinto legal fue que, en la pantalla de la cajera aparecía el siguiente  concepto "Donación caritas A. C.", al ver lo anterior escrito, le pregunté a la cajera que si ellos "Soriana" lo manejaba como una donación,   a lo cual me respondió que sí.      Pues bueno ahora litigando fiscal entiendo que todas y cada una de las  donaciones son deducibles de   impuestos para cada contribuyente, siempre  y cuando se expida el dicho comprobante.

I made 6 pymts on it, and some circumstances have made me unable to make pymts for the last 5 months.  I am now able to make regular monthly pymts of $100, but a new collection agency (Prof Recovery Sys) is after me for the debt.  I know I owe it, so it's not a matter of needing it validated.  I'm concerned about dealing with the new CA. What if they won't accept payments? I was previously working with a cons credit agncy, but was kicked out of the program for not being able to make my pymts this last few months.  My counselor suggested I look into bankruptcy at one point in time, but I'm now able to make pymts and want to pay my debt-afterall I did run up the credit card bills.  I owe 4000 on this debt. I'm looking for advice how to deal with new CA.  They have been calling for me at work, although they've been told I cannot accept personal calls.

Started doing lawns, then got into more lands. installations. The last couple yrs in MICH have been killing me, everyone is holding on to thier money or looking for the low bid. I do quality work, and wont work for free. Too many guys are getting into this field due to big 3 layoffs - they get a truck and trailer, and some mowers and off they go,.. basically working for peanuts (no isurance or lisence) I am getting frustrated because we have lost about 30% of our maint work over the last 2 yrs and trying to keep things afloat is a real job in itself. I work many hours trying to keep job things going and growing, but it seems like my business is going backwards. Also recently I injured my arm "tennis elbow'  Too much working with that arm and now its killin my production. I have always worked side by side with the workers (2 others) but Lately I have been looking to get out of the physical side of the biz.

20070729030840AAiTw8q	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can a lien still be placed on my home?	My ex husband and I bought a car in my name because of his bad credit.  The car was repoed.  I have a judgement against me for it & have been making monthly payments on it. I have a court date coming up to review this case because I was not yet divorced & felt my ex should help pay this debt. Now, there is a lien on my house that I just found out about at closing.  The divorce judge decided my ex is responsible for half of this debt. He was to get $2000 out of the equity in the sale of the house based on there being $10,000 of equity in it. There is only $4000 equity. The creditor is trying to take all of this and I will have no money to move back to my home state.  Can they put a lien on my home while I have an order to make payments, as well as another court date to review my case in a couple of months? Is there anything I can do to stop this?
