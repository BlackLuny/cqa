r1D9P4Vyaa	A sure fire way to make her smile. look into eyes...smile.... Then shoot her a "Wink"   works Every Time.  Good Luck!|`|7ulpcNi7aa	Holding her hand at any moment even if its just for a second and  looking her in the eyes and smiling are good thins in not so sure about the other two they just sound like excuses to touch her
JD5ymxKTaa	Think of something he likes more than a flower.
SHEhwsUaaa	i think it could work, and i am in love with "someone" that happens to be a cyber lover!LOL does this happen to do anything with a certain girl????? it could work, i mean you can talk through e-mail and when she finally gets old enough she can travel and see you, i mean yall may not live that far apart! just keep working on it. hopefully one day your dreams will come true babe!LOL LOVE MeGaN|`|FIvA9OVxaa	ya it dont work out it always happens that they live in another state and you can never see each other and it wont work out so find someone off the computer and go with them or talk to a girl near you that is on the computer|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	or it could work dont listen to him you can get a passport and see each other da   i mean if you relly love each other and looking for it then ya belive it
tsoc9tihaa	okayy :)  firstly dont think about cuddling up on the sofa with kids aha  seems nice doesnt it, but thats a while off  ive had these thought with my boyfriend of 2 years and we split up  kinda messes up your head.      im not going to say your too young to like someone  maybe too young to get all serious :)    basically. keep her your friend  things usually progress from there if you want them too.  and you might get your 16yr old dream :)    if yyou say close you never know what will happen  dont push it though  let it run its course :)    valentines day - a card?  you dont even have to put your name in it if you dont want to  and for your age a small teddy if you want to give a gift :)      good luck boyo|`|00ieFmYbaa	how cute...bless!!!    im 20 still have never really fallen in love!!     go to the cinema with her or buy her something like a teddy or a fancy bar of chocolate!!! she'll love it!    plus with the whole boyfriend thing wait till ur a lil older like 16, keep things cool with your friend, and make sure no other boy flirts with her!!!|`|vrfuO9Asaa	ask her out she might say yes u sound like u really luv her|`|GaxJ5Qiwaa	bless u will love many girls in your life ur only 13
ICeP717gaa	It's totally normal to be attracted to other people. You can't help it, even your boyfriend of two years, as much as he loves you.. he still looks at girls, or feels attracted to other girls. It's human nature.     The only thing keeping you from driving yourself to radical actions is that you know the difference between love and infatuation.   -Which is very good!-  You can feel attracted and flirt with people, put always know at the end of the day that taking it any further would be wrong :D  Cheating or anything of the like would ruin your relationship with your boyfriend---And then you'd ask yourself... was that really worth it?|`|KDst9z5Naa	Yes , you can love someone and be physically attracted to someone else. That is natural and happens. I have been in that situation and I stayed faithful to my fiance. You eventually get over that feeling .|`|565101df464ca9726935d729db732d92aa	Of course. I have personally experienced this and I am married. You really have to be careful with this. It could lead to trouble if you aren't careful. It's not wrong to be attracted to other people,BUT this is where you have to cross the line if you really love your bf. Hope that helps
ooH1yocTaa	okay...  first of all, i'm going to give you advice based on things we have in common.  1.  i'm egyptian &  2.  i'm Coptic Orthodox (similar to Catholicism).    you're like, what, 14?  you're on auto-stroke here;  all teens are horny every day of their teenage lives.    your hormones are running wild.  you just entered puberty not too long ago, and you're exploring your body.  that's completely normal.  looking at girl-on-girl porn or whatever is your choice.  hey, no judgement here.  we've all been there.    but unless you get hot and heavy specifically for CHICKS only, then i'd say you're straight, or maybe bi?  i think you're just curious about other girls' bodies.  there's nothing wrong with that.  we come in all shapes & sizes, and you're appreciating a Godly creation.      p.s.  if you DO decide to have sex with your boyfriend (i looked at your past questions), please be safe!  make him wrap it before he taps it...  you don't want a little one running around, nor do you want to catch an STD.  (:
sPPbta7vaa	That is a tough one sweetie.   So you 'think' she likes you, huh?  You know what I would do to find out if a guy likes me. I would go search things through the internet, such as signs of guys liking me, or how to know if a guy likes me. So you should try that. But if you need to know signs without the internet. First you need to show her you love her. You need to be there for her, speak to her, care about her, embrace her affectionately. Show her that she is safe with you. If she acts back uncomfortably, don't think she doesn't like you, maybe she just needs time. If you're the type of guy that would have the guts to go up to a sweet lady  and tell her you kind of love her, then score, you should! But if your those shy type of guys, this will take time, and you might need to find out if she likes you.   You should add more details on what she does. Does she look at you upon a whole crowd. Does she like talking to you, laughs at your jokes (even lame ones), does she back you up, smiles at you innocently. Is she sometimes rude and says stuff like "shut up, you have to work"? That's not because she hates you, that might be because she's afraid of you finding out that she loves you.   1- She constantly looks at you  2- Notice change in behavior (either too loud or too low)  3- Talks to you. Sometimes expects you to talk her, and when you don't, she becomes a bit sad.  4- Trusts you  5- Flirts. Ex: looks at you for about 2 seconds, smiles, and slowly looks away.    These are all basics. I say go with your instincts.   I like this guy and I thought he liked me back, I've been searching and stuff, and to find out he DOES like me. :]  Everything is vague now, it's normal, but it'll all become clear as long as you wait for it.    Hope I helped and good luck  Sincerely,  Midnight Angel|`|HHyny0JSaa	Ask her|`|qI6N137Jaa	If I were you I would just tell her.  It is better to know than always be wondering, even if her answer is not the one you want to hear.|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Ask her to the movies, good place for kissin :p if she kisses you, then you know. lol|`|hXFndli2aa	Tell her how you feel about her and then ask her what she thinks, at first she might not want to respond to you because she may be shy and may also like you.|`|kqd5sYzPaa	I got the same problem but in the opposite way i kinda show the guy i like him by looking into his eyes and laughing at his jokes even if they are not there funny if she really likes you she would text you alot but with most girls they might like if you ask them out and most of the time we will say yes because she might be checkafriad to ask you out so check for these signs then ask her out and i am almost postive she will say yes|`|x88DfLokaa	well if it was me i wouldnt just ask like that because i need some reassurance .. and im sure alot of other people are like that too. but still i would wannan know too.. maybe she does like you but she wants to make sure you feel the same way.. so maybe you should tell her. but in your own way so that way your not putting yourself too much othere you know.|`|zJGju89Eaa	Tell her you like her. The worst thing she can tell you is "no."|`|dH9IhDIFaa	Tell her how you feel and see if she reciprocates.  Thats all you can really do.|`|lgBD4BS0aa	Have a person that you are both friends with and have them ask her, and then have the person tell you.|`|aJiMBMB3aa	Okay, so first of all, Why do you think that she won't tell you? Probably because she likes you but is a little embarassed to tell you -or that she wants to keep this going almost like a game, to get more attention (smart!)      So anyways... I know that you understand if you tell her the worst she could say is no.. but rejection hurts, and obvioulsy no one likes being rejected.      So i suggest to hang out with her, and time will tell.. over a few days of just hanging out with the two of you, i think you'll find it easier to tell, and maybe she'll feel more comfertable telling you the truth.      Or.. if you want to go all middle-school, which sometimes works.. but might backfire, you can ask one of her friends.. but i dont suggest this method.. i think hanging out and telling her how you feel will leave you with a better result.     Good luck !! --Be nice!
tFoSy2YRaa	Tickets to see a band he likes are always good. DVDs, CDs.|`|om61WSowaa	You dont need to 'buy' him anything .. ;)  x|`|CtUVT49Gaa	a pension|`|pXeQFtgIaa	Well what does he like and what is the price range|`|QMiDZUE0aa	Buy a wrist band if he is a Shuttle player. Buy a Bat if he is a Cricket player. Buy a Shoe if he is a Football player. Buy a Helmet if he is a Rider. Buy a Watch if he is None of the Above.   BETTER BUY HIM A BANK IF HE IS YOUR BOYFRIEND. Buying him a Bank would save him from becoming a Bankrupt......|`|ldwaVRy4aa	These others answer are lame, get him a Nixon watch.|`|5sHcB4wuaa	how about, buy some sexy outfit for yourself and give him a good present in bed
0d88ab7c3e5ace15a916d7103b2561abaa	yes they can be.. but probably not w/ that guy he is too into you|`|HHyny0JSaa	Absolutely guys and girls can just be friends. I have plenty of male friends myself. Its true that some guys approach with friendship for the hopes it will lead to something more, but not always. You have to be straight forward with this guy and tell him that you only like him as a friend. Texting back isnt leading him on, but the sooner you are honest with him about the way you feel, the better. He may not want to be your friend anymore, but if that's the case then he never really was your friend and his loss.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	It depends on the guy. A lot of guys are just looking for a girl to hook up with so they'll randomly send out a lot of texts to a lot of girls and take what they can get. This happens a lot in college dorms. If a guy and girl have been just friends for a while and know each other well then of course they can stay friends without a problem. But if you get jealous when he talks about other girls he's interested in, or if you're jealous of his current girlfriend, then you may have feelings for him.|`|kG9oI68eaa	yes my best friend is a boy|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	guys dont always want to be in the friend zone. i keep most guys i know in that zone, but the other few are like a kiss you when i see you thing. not while im dating someone of course. i tell them bluntly that i just want a friend and most of them stay a friend but there are the ones who try to make me get into them and i just have to get a little mean.|`|ivg0lRUraa	It is very possible for a girl to just be friends with a boy, not really possible for a boy to just be friends with a girl if they are attracted to them. Boys always believe that theres a chance no matter what you say and will often settle for just being friends but with the chance you'll change your mind if they hang around long enough. I do know girls that I am just friends with, because I'm not attracted to them, its fine.|`|U9vE47hdaa	yep. it's not wrong for you to text back.    i'm female and ALL my friends are guys.    except one. jessica tompkins.    she's cool. she's like the sister i never had|`|XDA2O4nQaa	Yes you can be friends with a guy|`|N2e248rTaa	just try not to flirt - then he might get the wrong idea! but nearly all of my good friends are boys! that's because they like you for who you are :D. text him like you text your girl friends :).|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	I don't see the harm in it.  Even though if you were to be on a date it doesn't mean both of you are serious.  Tell him that you like him as a friend.  He will understand.|`|HfVREDSyaa	Yes, they can be. Guys sometimes just want to be friends. No, it's not wrong to text back.. And usually it's not leading him on. Just try not to give him signals that you like him, like flirting too much. I talk to a guy that likes me, and I have a boyfriend... and yeah, nothing comes of it.|`|37PpYx8oaa	Guys and girls can just be friends, but only when all other circumstances fit together just right.  If he's keeps texting you, it's because he's thinking about you as more than just a friend.  That means your feelings are Not mutual, and the friendship will not work.  You'll feel frustrated when he isn't happy just being your friend, he'll feel jealous and resentful.    I'm sorry.|`|JEqt3dDRaa	yeah of course.....    3 of my best friends are guys!!    it works better if they are a lil older tho. maybe by 3 yrs!|`|jVRvGDEMaa	are you kid'in? if you are attractive guys want only one thing, they don't enjoy your insane talk, stupid joke, frustrating stories ans stuff.   If you want friends than quickly make a boyfriend and introduce them to them, then you can find few friends ,if you don't want to get engage with someone, tell everyone you got a boyfriend who's living somewhere else, other city, country or may be planet.|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	yes, i've remained friends with lots of guys tat i either liked or visversa.|`|7cpNW4VMaa	of course......you may have a guy friend that you are not attracted to in that way|`|PAgGyXyMaa	YES.    I have many female friends...  and I don't want to have sex with them, either.    I like our friendship just the way it is.    If you're sensing that a guy is liking you more than that or that he wants you, tell him straight up that you just want to be friends and nothing more.    It's good to be CLEAR about that.|`|lSag21xbaa	its very possible that a guy can be your friend.the txting  him isn't leading him on,well it may depending on what you two are talking about.all you have to do is be honest with him, say you just wanna be friends right away so he doesn't think he has a chance of getting with you relationship wise.then after you two are friends just be careful with the hole flirting thing cause that could ruin the friendship...|`|4bvq4IAxaa	If you're leading him on it all depends on what you're saying in your texts and how he feels about you. You can def be friends with him. Just let him know you don't like him that way.
qDpFSqn4aa	Most people speak from the heart at first and then get into logic (if it's in them) after they feel comfortable together.  The heart guides us and our logic tells us if we are right or not.  As Spock says, "Logic is the root to life but there is no logic when it comes to heart"  the two conflict.  We need to use logic to enforce what our heart tells us.  I've had two heart attacks.  You think my body is trying to tell my head something?  LOL, just kidding.
hXFndli2aa	Nope i wouldn't be intimidated by your size just intrigue by how big you are and may want to get know you, but im the type of girl who likes tall guys that are physically fit.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	I'm 5'0'' tall and 97 pounds I would be scared of you.|`|kUhY0od5aa	No.... personality and what type of person you are is more importand.|`|PD1WpoEsaa	hell no....i like a big strong man!|`|sCpPiEpcaa	imma have to say that yes you would only cause im really short im only 5'1 and i will just get really scared buh i think that if u walk up to some one my height yeah u woul intimidate them buh if u walk up to an average or as tall as u person u wouldnt idk|`|fAgKDpN3aa	well how big is your dick?|`|QICqcjTZaa	No....its not your height but your personality x|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	no i'd just say you're amazingly huge! lol|`|BUET39wmaa	yowza     you are a playground!  lol|`|3UlGItEEaa	Nope. I would see you as nice and cuddly for the most part....and possibly great in bed as well.    (I am 20 also, for all those wondering based on what I said >.>)|`|kG9oI68eaa	You look way cute to me!! (;|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	wow i would have to really look up to you because i am 5'3... but um no. it is good that you are in shape too.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	It's not your height dude    SteveC|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Nope. I'd be intrigued. Unless you came up to me in an intimidating manner....  6'7" is quite big, my tallest BF was 6'5" (.... and I miss him terribly.)|`|xy9JYtkTaa	sorry.  i don't like big muscular guys.  it's kind of gross.|`|AA11649550	hell nahhhh ill be excited=] ahahaa  i like em BIGGGGGGGGGGG
sdeUhMELaa	If a guy tells you that he likes you then there is a good chance that he likes you more than a friend. Depends how he said it and the means he used to say it.     If he tells you in a sarcastic way he might be either playing with you or trying not to make it look like he is letting you know his feelings to quick. Then, if he tells you through a text or an email it might be a for sure thing because he is really nervous about telling you.    I hope I could be of some help.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	At first meeting, he likes you as a friend (to start).  If you start dating then he'll switch to he loves you.  Take him at his word and don't read too much into what he says just take it as is.    Hope this helps.|`|U9vE47hdaa	depends on how he says it and how much emotion he puts into what he says.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	He probably likes you more than a friend.|`|rEVgk9uxaa	MORE definately!|`|1uv8wjvYaa	Well sounds like he is puttin out feelers to see if you respond positively.I would say he really does like you but just a little shy and you know thats ok because confidence will come.|`|ulH28Fibaa	usually no, it means just friends    if he says he likes you ALOT, think about it    but if he says i like you, most likely its a good friend, or like alot of my friends; friends who happen 2 be girls XD|`|gqvvXknQaa	If a guy tells you he "likes" you, you can be sure he has feelings for you. He wouldn't go around saying to his buddies that he "likes" them... So if this boy says he "really likes you", then go for it!    If a guy tells you that you're "nice" "good friend" "etc", then he may not be feeling you more as a friend.|`|zB2jkUVcaa	well usually realli like is a bit more than just like    in my book   like = friends  reali like = best friends/ small crush  love = big crush   reali love = in love    so yer this guy is more of a friend and if u gt 2 no him more who knows wat might happen    hope i helped x|`|gsMZgxKGaa	Really likes you or really really likes you. Don't get a big head and ease into it.... No, really your in.|`|zXwTDQXnaa	well Girl what can i say we all that situation in ourlife'ss   but my answer to your question is that you have to check for signs that he makes for example if he acts shy in front of u wen u guys go out wiFriendsnds that may be a sing that he likes u but if he acts all chil then hes just as frend.  u just have to decide on the aspects of him look at the way he acts listen to the way he speaks to u just look because the littlest signs are the biggest
yNbGq4viaa	Dump the fiance.  He should have been with you in the hospital and then he wouldn't have had to worry about someone else (who sounds like a really good friend) answering your phone or giving you messages.  Also, if he was mature he would understand that you were in the hospital and didn't need a lot more pressure on you.  I think you should take a long, hard look at your relationship.  He knows you were in the hospital and he hasn't even called you since you got out to see how you're doing or to make sure you're ok?  Doesn't sound like the kind of guy I'd want to spend the rest of my life with.  You deserve better.  He should know your friend's actions are not your fault and he should get over it!  I wouldn't wait for him to call.  I would leave him a voice mail telling him that since he has decided to end our relationship by turning his back on me when I needed him to be there for me and holding me responsible for other people's actions, that I don't feel that I can continue in the relationship.  That would be it for me, but the decision is yours.  Also, I'd have a talk with Marc about disrespecting my friends or loved ones and using my phone to send those texts.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Your fiance has the right to be mad at himself. Why wasn't he in the hospital with you? And why is he acting like such a child? He made the colossally adult decision to get married but he's giving you the silent treatment like a 6 year old. Wait for him to grow up and call you. It'll be a long wait so you can use that time to seriously ponder whether someone who acts like that is actually someone you want to spend the rest of your life (dealing) with.|`|lkxFy681aa	He does, and he doesn't.    If he trusts you, he should be fine with a male friend staying with you.  Besides, you're in HOSPITAL. Its unlikely anything will happen.    He has the right to be worried, but what he did was going a little too far.|`|QCtb7dIhaa	He has a right to be mad...not sure if he has a right to be mad at you.  There seems like there's more to it.  But your man should be communicating with you, regardless.     How does your fiance feel about your friendship with Marc?      Marc shouldn't be sending disrespectful text messages through your phone.  Period.  You both should be upset with Marc and he needs to be out of the picture if you hope to have your engagement go smoothly.|`|WF9Knlpcaa	No he shouldn't take it out on you.    But what your friend said was not right. If your fiance is calling there for you and you're friend is there to help you then he should easily remember to give you your messages if he is going to answer your phone.    & how come Marc was there and not your fiance??|`|pizsAvupaa	O wow I think mark likes you...also you should text 2 your fiance saying "hey I understand why your mad at me but,its all just a misunderstanding.please answer back if you wanna know what happened"...yea sumtin like that.if he don't answer back 2 dat he would be a jerk 2 not even try and find out wats up with you and marc.^_^|`|b5PjQzEYaa	Write him a letter and let it go from there. If he can't show understanding then he is not worth your time. Also, where was he when you needed him?|`|172098d5d415f589483bf057e57cf47eaa	YOUR FIANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH U NOT MARC, IT LOOKS TO ME THAT MARC CARES MORE FOR U THAN YOUR SO CALLED FIANCE.|`|C2olZsNiaa	I don't think he has a right to b emad at you.  if he is your fiance he should have been the one at the hospital supporting you instead of your friend marc being up there.  Even if your fiance has a good reason for not being there I still don't think he has a right to be mad.  I would not even try to contact him again.  If he is going to be as immature as he is being then this is the prefect way for you to see what kind of person your fiance really is.  Do you want to spend the rest of your likfe with an insecure, jealous, selfish person.  I call him selfish because instead of him thinking of your feelings and your emotions regarding the issue is is chosing to only think about his feelings.  It sounds like he has a  lot of growing up to do.|`|oBRERF5paa	honestly if he really loves you then he will get over it..    An if he cant then that should be a sign too you let him go.|`|Vt3EtztBaa	Well why wasn't your fiance at the hospital with you? Because if he couldn't spend the night he should have still came to see you. Marc should have not talked to him like that.
uK3ncjLbaa	Going and talking to a crush in person is a lot more nerve racking than just viewing him from afar I would know. My tip to you is to just act like its no big deal, act yourself, seeing each other face to face is a lot more interesting than from afar. As for getting the guts to just go talk to him just take a minute and prep your self mentally by telling yourself that maybe this crush can lead onto something more.   ;)  *just got for it and remember everyone seems mysterious at first... the fun is in trying to uncover what type of guy your crush is (personal experience)|`|ifd5pkakaa	You need to just talk to him and be like just drop hints at him...lol...flirt things like that..|`|qDpFSqn4aa	How can you really like someone you've never met? If you've been talking on line then you know nothing about him. I've talked with a lot of girls on line but never fell for any of them (thank God). Most of them I met in person was real...well lets just say I wanted nothing to do with them when I met them. Some of them actually scared me when I saw them others had underlying mental problems or they drank until drunk every day (I hate alcohol).    If you're smart you'll take everything SLOWLY and give him lots of thought before you go any farther. Don't you realize that there have been too many girls killed at first meeting from talking on the net? It's not a very good way to meet people. I've gotten one good person off the net and even though she was great her husband and brother weren't good at all. Both guys tried to kill her, her brother paid a guy to rape her and her husband was a cross dresser and bisexual.    I hope you're smarter than to believe anything anyone says in the net.    Hope this helps.|`|W9zpeGE2aa	stangle his jewlls(balls) and kiss him on lips|`|vS4LzNPFaa	well u guys r friends so it shudnt be  2 hard 2 juss say hi nd start a random convo  juss hope he keeps it going 4m there  gud luck|`|kZFw2SGUaa	give it a go and just talk to him see how it goes   u will never no if u dont try   good luck xoxo
X3GRTBXtaa	im a senior in high school and i never have had a gf yet, but i also don't want to just lose my virginity just to lose it. when it happens i want it to mean something to me and if i have to wait for the right girl to find me then so be it. I don't understand all the other guys around me that just hook up with girls to have sex, call me strange or whatever but i want love in a relationship.|`|PPFonRYdaa	I was just too shy in high school. The worst part is that I'm actually a very good looking guy and I know for a fact I could have gotten some good looking girls. So to answer your question, YES, I definately regret it now. It's not something that bothers me though. I have a very good sex life now and couldn't be happier.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	it's probably worth wait cuz after you've done it you start wanting it and it will change the way you act... . .but if your ready (like most people) then go for it cuz it feels Amazing!!|`|1GxMGmkqaa	not at all! i saved myself for marriage! nah not really but my first was my only for many many years...|`|Z54IWoClaa	I can't answer from personal experience, but I have friends who regretted it. Honestly there is no time frame on when to lose it. You just have to find the right person/situation. I really don't think virginity is a big deal for guys. If by college you still have it, you will lose it freshman year. If you still have it for most of college, then it gets kind of awkward when you start dating a girl and you tell her. I know more guys who regret losing it to a random girl just for the sake of losing it.|`|eGlUvVjnaa	I have not gone to high school yet but i am planning on losing my virginity there|`|Zep08tuuaa	Never|`|ydIocfpQaa	F @k no, yes i did have girl friends but i got scared every time i almost got some so i dindt go along. my first time was two mo's ago and it was worth the wait|`|qQx48XZuaa	Well I've had sex 134.2 times since entering high school, but I feel as if I can speak for those who have not had the sexual experience before. Well most of them were gay, but for the few others I have to say that they don't regret it seeing as how they are STILL virgins.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	i honestly dont have a problem with it. its nothin to be ashamed of. and yes ive had a few girlfriends and ive done everything besides sex. but i dont think that im gonna have sex in highschool and i dont have a problem with it and you shouldnt either.|`|1fUPdDiFaa	Absolutely not. Sex is sacred to marriage. "Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord" - 1 Co 6:13  How foolish it is to spoil the good gift of God by misusing it.|`|9xltuXkiaa	i had several girlfriends.. but the core problem with those.. is they werent based on a true friendship.. i knew them.. but we werent exactly friends who spent all teir time together and shared everything prior to being bf and gf.. needless to say none of them worked out.. and no i didnt have sex.    i was also worried i'd die before i had sex.. never be in a relationship etc..     i do regret not losing my virginity with the one i eventually married.. tho she wasnt a virgin either..    i'm an old man too.. you kids today have to worry about aids..     virginity is a MASSIVE PLUS.. in a mate..|`|LtOuo18Aaa	Yeah. There was a girl who was really into me and was pretty forward with wanting to have sex with me. In fact everyone knew that she wanted to and i turned her down for two years and then she gave up. Ironically that's when i wanted to get with her but i figured i had already dug my grave so i might as well lie in it. If i could go back in time i  would kick my own *** and tell myself to do her.|`|TuaDHolKaa	No I did not have any girlfriends.    I DID regret not losing my virginity in high school      39 and still a Virgin!|`|ZeFXSeUnaa	Not at all its was heavenly|`|Lfpy4YyHaa	im still in high school
SDlKE6tVaa	Well, MY opinion makes up a portion of what SOCIETY thinks... I think people are shocked when you hear someone is a virgin in today's society.  They are few and far between.  I don't think it is frowned upon by any means... I think it is weird.  I would want to know if I connect with someone.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	These days, being a virgin is rare at 23...very rare.  I think it's great if a girl can remain a virgin that long.  It shows they have a great will power and I very much admire any girl with these properties.  It says a lot about their life and personality.  I'm not every guy but I have to bow to girls who are saving themselves for marriage.  I've dated a few girls like that and I didn't even try to have sex with them because in my book they are what makes this world a better place.    If people make fun of you for this then you need to find REAL friends to hang with.  You're  1 in my book and I applaud you for your reserves.    Girls have fun no matter what.  If it's fun to you to be humped by every other guy then so be it but I'd think it has more appeal for us guys to be a virgin.  It gives us something to look forward to and if a guy can't see this then he's not the right guy for you.  You deserve better...much better.    Hope this helps.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I think with girls society would say it is "acceptable" to be a virgin well into your 20's, though rare. For guys, if they are still a virgin by 20, some people assume they are "gay" and their guy friends will taunt them for it.|`|LykjWv6faa	Apparently, from society's view (not mine) it's okay to be a slut and sleep with the first guy that buys you dinner. But, it's 'loserish' to be a virgin at 23.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	i don't think people really care about the amount of people you've slept with, to be perfectly honest|`|lkxFy681aa	I can't say I care.    But I would say that a 23 year old virgin would be viewed as weird in most cases.|`|fFpa0rz9aa	Go fuq.|`|jx5lMejuaa	well im 14 and still a virgin and ive heard some pple making some comments to me about being slow...so i think that if a 23 yrs old was a virgint then he/she will deffinately be made fun of because, they are recognized as being probably 'scared' or something like that.|`|525CU3GCaa	I was a vrigin till I was 29 years old|`|JEqt3dDRaa	anything now-a-days is acceptable......    doesn't make it right!!!
4293T0LNaa	id be hella fukn pissed, i would talk to him about this, it seems like he has no respect for u whatsoever, dump the fool..|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Dump him! He is useing you for sex and going around and telling everybody!|`|c55O7jqXaa	He acts like he is talking to one of buddies or another girl he likes.     I do not think this is ok. He needs to stop if he really cares for you.|`|oBRERF5paa	well he should respect you  and not talk about your sex lives..   Yes you should be upset.  But its not something you should fight about  flip the script ask him what he would do if you was to do that to him...|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I would not have that! i'd kick his ar*e and dump the idiot.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	dump him, he doesn't show any respect for you
hazucBxbaa	boys mad cause girl acts like she doesnt care about the rejection, my guess is that boy wants girl to cry and sob bout it, and be upset, thats what most guys want, is for girls to weep over them and care! most likely that is the case|`|joDZLoc0aa	He's mad because it hurts he's ego that his saying no didn't crush her whole world because the world does not revolve around him.|`|ZPDb4KRXaa	Boy is mad because he wants her to be more persistent and doesn't want girl to give up on him so easily.|`|Zep08tuuaa	Girl asks boy out on a date----Offer  Boy rejects girl-------------------Answer    Till here its fine and balancing    Girl pretends it's no big deal---- This could be a reason. She should have gone away smoothly.|`|HfVREDSyaa	Probably because he wanted you to be more responsive or upset about it!|`|554cBHBZaa	hi dis z krishna answering you..     for your question the best answer z givin up..  the girl had given up her choice for his boy... and that made him happy since ha has a girl who shows great respect to his words and he might have thought that she z only for him.. and this z a little bit posessiveness.    dis made that boy to be driven out crazy behind that girl..    i think my answer ll satisfy you|`|mKmrfeX7aa	he s not mad he s just horrified of girls face
St0bKidyaa	omg if he's hotter date him!!|`|bXRswATbaa	More than likely if you let his friend even begin to believe you have any kind of feelings in return you'll not only destroy your relationship with your boyfriend but also you'll destroy their friendship.  If he's a true friend he'll let go.  If he isn't he won't, in which case you need to talk to your boyfriend about it.     Just remember that a man is either loyal or not- and if he isn't loyal enough to be good to his supposed best friend then he likely won't be loyal to you either.|`|bifGJ4Veaa	make it crystal clear he is not to hit on me and make my boyfriend aware if he did|`|AA12338050	Do them both. JUST kidding.  It depends on your personal situation.. Maybe your boyfriend should know about this..|`|7327db802b6cc1e601e46900dde82c26aa	what i would do is talk to the friend... let him know you really love your bf (if thats your case) and hopefully he backs off... i mean the worst that could happen is he becomes a stalker.... but then again if he is really best friends with your boyfriend he will take the hint and back off..|`|F3VPADcRaa	i would strut me stuff around him and make him wish he was his friend.|`|grAU3MJcaa	Avoid him and let my boyfriend know.
MX1shAbcaa	Talking is the only thing you can do i guess =\.  You should influence he mother to pressure the point that she needs to get an educations.  You should also keep pressuring it to her and giving her examples of where she is going to be if she does not go to school and what she could be if she really used all of her potential, tell her that she could have so much better and that there is no reason for her to be putting it off.  ~William|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	It's called tough love and is hard on the ones doing it but is the only way to force her to take an interest in the world that she lives in.    BTW you never mentioned drugs or Algol these can cause|`|dOd7UqvGaa	Hmmm, sounds like my sister.     btw if she is taking drugs, i simply tell her to lay off drugs or move out.     but as to tough love, talking is about the only thing you can do.     and shes 18, legally she is an adult.
EdCapqHtaa	Up a tree...  Left me feeling pretty confused to be honest|`|3UlGItEEaa	I was 7. I was on the school bus and a cute guy was teaching girls how to kiss ( I know, gross right?). He asked me to come sit with him towards the back so I sat next to him. He asked if he could kiss me and I said yes.     From what I remember it was one of the best kisses ever, but I got really crushed when he turned and kissed another girl right after me *puffs out cheeks*    I didn't want to kiss again until around age 15.|`|MNuS31nsaa	i was 14 when i got my first real kiss. i really liked him. he walked me home for the first time so i knew something was up. im like hmm..maybe he likes,me? and when we got to me house, we were standing infront of my garage and i was getting kinda nervous because i had a feling something was gonna happen. and he asked me if i was nervous. and i lied and said no haha. i was really nervous. and then he kissed me. and then i kissed him again. it was sorta weird but a good weird. it wasnt gross.|`|joDZLoc0aa	My first kiss was when I was 13. It was really cute. We walking at night holding hands and then it started to rain. (I love the rain.) So, he called my name and when I turned around he kissed me. It was a soft nice kiss. I loved it!
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u need to wait until he is completely over her, if u push it it could mean a broken heart for u. if his actions show u that he is not over her, don't go there. don't be in such a hurry, if its meant to be it will be. if he is still having contact with the other girl, it means he isn't really over her yet.why settle being a second choice for someone.|`|2aBT7kQoaa	Tell him that you care about him and that you'd like to be together. Tell him that you respect him for wanting to make sure that he's completely over this other girl but that you think he isn't going about it the best way.    He probably is trying to get over her. Not seeing her all the time would probably make him get over it quicker and he probably knows that but, because he isn't over her yet, he still wants to see her all of the time and can't help himself. Don't nag him about it, just tell him what you think.     Let him know that you'll be waiting for him once he's over her and that you think it's time he moved on and stopped seeing her all of the time. If he does then great, if not then move on yourself.|`|mKmrfeX7aa	Forget him his probably ugly.|`|qQx48XZuaa	yo ka i be havin the same propblam sista.|`|p6Pv6ioOaa	Just give it up.  He doesn't love you, or he would have done or said something by now.  He doesn't care about you either, if he did he wouldn't keep drawing you in close like that when he knows it hurts you.  That's for his ego, not because he cares.
W0KQTXrvaa	yea i think it's wrong so would your husband, why did you marry a man?|`|8CTosi9saa	It's most mens dream to be with 2 woman at once, would you share her with him? If you just want to try it don't.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Hello.  LOL  I assume you mean you are cheating with a woman?  Why did you marry a man..?|`|JiUwpYSXaa	Are you bi-sexual?|`|96zZlJVYaa	then why married a man when you know your desire are for women?|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Mrs. Robinson and the Mail Carrier.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Yes it's wrong.  Cheating is cheating.|`|jkOph5PNaa	thats hot!|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	I would say what Thomas said , Why ?|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	let him watch|`|6c4Oe1pVaa	If you are bisexual; you've gotta come into the open.If your husband loves you; you are going to hurt his feelings.|`|s4iVl04raa	Being attracted to women when you are married is not wrong. I'm bisexual, and I'm very happily married. My husband actually knows the girl who I was dating before I starting dating him. He has no problem with it at all! But, I do not still date and/or sleep with women. I love my husband way too much to cheat on him. Even if you're bisexual, cheating is cheating, period. Unless you and your husband have some arrangement where he doesn't mind you having girlfriends or female partners on the side, going behind his back to hook up with other women is still a form of betrayal. If you want to date/have sex with women, you and your husband should talk about it.
AA12340254	You seriously need to seek counseling. I am not being mean. You need to talk to a professional so you can be helped to understand what is going on with you. Know this, you are not alone, there are many people feel like you do. don't let the jerk  answers get you down.|`|zG4QCxK7aa	mmmh my cousin started doing this.. hes about 12:S it really freaked me out but he likes girls too i think... i think you should talk abt this with someone u trust... maybe even ur parents if possible... figure yourself out..|`|uiOFJasoaa	get the surgery if you want.  you'd probably have to go see a doctor to find out about the cost.|`|U9vE47hdaa	don't get plastic surgery. it would ruin your good looks. if you need someone to talk to you can email me: akivasha_carlson@yahoo.com or golden_demon19@yahoo.com    don't you dare get plastic surgery! i'll kick your ***!|`|dp2oNqa0aa	lol wow ahh do what ever makes you feel happy =)|`|AA11441704	Would you be willing to have kids too?|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Technically you'd be a lesbian then, it would be much easier possibly to dress like a woman. You have to realise there is a lot of work in switching over and it takes 2 years, you have to have psyc tests to check you sane thinking and that you really want it. You then have to live as a woman for 1 year. Plus there is the discomfort of other people and how they treat you. My advice is it's bad but check out Ugly Betty. One of the leading actors plays the brother who changed to a woman, also seek an LGBT group who can give more advice, goodluck|`|1uv8wjvYaa	bababa is still alittle confused you should put a little more under the bridge before you take any steps to alter what god has blessed upon you,seek some professional guidence.|`|13LutlWBaa	go see a shrink.|`|cFNA6fU1aa	talk to your mom.  google it a bit; make sure it's what you want.  there are definately surgeries and such for that;  but they're VERY expensive.  make sure it's really what you want, hun (:|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	Gosh , accept the fact that u are a guy !  accept urself for who u are , dont take any plastic surger and be real|`|4Nky5636aa	umm thts a really BIG desicion. i suggest u think about this and talk it over to your parents/friends.|`|AA10425962	Jus cross dress bcuz once u get the surgery it is permanent unless you have money to reverse it nd be bisexual
X3tMbUmMaa	AWH THATS SAD !!   LIFES TOO SHORT HUN, TELL YER FRIEND HOW YOU FEEL. SHE;LL UNDERSTAND && IF SHE HUNG OUT WITH YU BEFORE SHE KNEW THE DETAILS AND AFTER SHE DOES ITLL MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.  ^^THAT MADE MORE SENSE IN MY HEAD LOL|`|KPXwwwMMaa	It sounds like you have some serious issues... too serious to be addressed on a web posting.     Since you've admitted you have an eating disorder, and that you wish to see your parents dead, I think it's safe to say that you are suffering emotionally. I think it is very important that you seek help from a professional counselor. If your parents don't want you to see one, I would seek one out at your school, or at a church.    I have had several friends with eating disorders and depression. It's not fun, and it's not something you are likely to be able to conquer on your own.     And as to your friend: try not to judge your friend too harshly, just as you don't like to be judged too harshly.
tsdHndRhaa	first of all at 40 i'd expect you to know how to spell and express yourself better than you do now, and also by the way you write and express yourself i can see your immature and this girl can be your daughter and she has her life ahead of her why would she want to give it up for someone in a different realm in their life?|`|QkMyhHkaaa	I agree with the previous gal !  What the f%$  !|`|QzDuXR9Gaa	She came to u for office work. Please behave properly.  This is against to ethics. She is doing job to earn money for her family and to support herself. Dont take advantage of her situation.|`|ngliqKqNaa	you should shut up then|`|61ZtWyqKaa	im going to assume you are married   and what do you mean bold do you mean she said hello to you or did she smile and sit in the office with you     get over it if she is talking to you it doesnt mean she is bold she is just being friendly at work     why did you hire this girl and why do you want a 22 yr old anyway     what do you have in common with her       what about your wife     and if there is not wife and u genuinly like this girl get to know her and see if you can get married     if there is a wife then shame on you       by the way the girl said no so in answer to ur question there is nothing you can do     and plz do not take advantage of your position and fire her coz she may come back to u  and sue u for unfair dismissal and sexual harrasment  which will be very public and embarrasing for you and those around you and you will most likely loose ur job     there have been an increasing number of cases in India recently and judges and the police are increasingly showing support to the women involved     behave like an adult not a 16 ur old|`|1tLmTjBxaa	impress|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	stop being a pedophile
KPXwwwMMaa	Is it okay? sure!    I would ask him in person, though - not on facebook.|`|xggSASTwaa	why not? just say hey you wanna go????
HKB2lZjjaa	well if you are still in touch with him in some way i think that you should go for it and start talking to him again. if you were such good friends before, then it will be easy to start a conversation with him. be interested in what he likes and show him that you have similarities. and while you get to know him, start the flirting :)    in time he may start to like you back if he hasn't already. It will then start from there.    good luck :)|`|tsoc9tihaa	catch up - whats the harm    if it all goes wrong  you dont see each other      win win situation
0ulKsvXlaa	There is no way someone can teach you.  I wouldn't worry about it either.  One day your legs will go weak, your heart will race, you will dream in daylight, and you won't be able to get enough of a particular person.  Then you'll know what love is.|`|lSag21xbaa	well!!!! love isn't something your supposed to understand. its one of those things your supposed to feel when the right person comes around. how you fall in love, you share a romantic relationship with you "other". when, is when you meet that right person..where, it can be anywhere and why!because god designed us to need love in our life...love is something that changes a person...|`|AA11078411	ouch. cant help you there... we all trying to figure it out.    you got company tho.

Keep it light. Of course, you could have a back up lovey card in case he gives you one that is on the deeper side.|`|f9wHTaURaa	you in a ribbon
FMfAcAGpaa	Not unless she is a skanky home-wrecker!  apparently he is not the greatest either otherwise he wouldn't speak to her like that.  She is best served staying far, far away from the creep!|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	That's about sex...It will never be more than that.|`|b26NgqOFaa	only he knows if he is willing to go all the way- but it does mean he's a scumbag.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	It means he is a horny man who thinks that girls more than half his age are stupid enough to fall into bed with him.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	you bet he is after her. some younger girls like older men. is your friend interested. i am curious,would she go out with him and consider starting a relationship with him?|`|96zZlJVYaa	she need to go to him and ask him can she meet his wife? if he ask her why, her reply should be, that she want to compare herself with his wife and see who is hot and sexy. And tell his wife that he always tell her she is hot and sexy. let see will he hit on her again. that is my take on this...|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	What a ridiculous question for so many reasons. Sometimes the answer should be obvious as it is for your question. Yes, he's looking to have sex. No, she (or you based on your other questions) shouldn't go after him.     Are your morals, or ethics, or sensibilities, or boundaries, or common sense so out of whack that you think it is ok for your friend (or you) to have sex with a married man who is going through some midlife crisis and is literally old enough to be her (or you) father? Or that's it's ok for said married perv to hit on your friend (or you) who is probably around the same age as the kids he has? Really?|`|x02jsjg6aa	It means he wants her and has horrible judgement.  Going for a married man is always more trouble than it's worth (and of course disrespectful and immature), however, some people have to make their own mistakes and actually get off on it.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	No!!  Tell your friend not to be a homewrecking sl-t.|`|jCMSybAnaa	It means he is a punk who can't deal with someone his own age.  It means he wants to run away from his problems instead of dealing with them like a man.  It means he is irresponsible with his words and is only interested in pleasing himself.  Tell your friend that real men don't lead young women on and that she should ignore him and wait for someone single.|`|B1sT1t44aa	No she should not go at a 40 years old married man that borders on a fine line of possibly being a pedophile?|`|9104dbe5b3752eb8c45069d579b885c3aa	Most definitely looking for an affair. The guy is an immoral, disgusting, perv. Tell your friend to tell him to take a hike.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Horney creep. He is going thru the change of life or he is just a creep. This is awful. He has no self respect or respect for his family. I hope his wife calls him on this and leaves his sorry ****.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	She should tell him what a dirty ol man he is (the truth)  And put him in his place.  I bet he's as pure as driven snow if his wife's around.
Gu0Yofnvaa	well, i read some where  and it said that if you were best friends, you would have fights and always make up , but if you were just friends , you would never become friends again...  this is true because , me and my best friend have been in a number of fights , some lasting a few days to the longest a couple of years , to a few months ,   don't worry , they will break up ... eventually|`|pCtWNPVCaa	i went through something very much a like! and to be honest i never got over the fact not talking to my bf anymore. it happen 3 yrs ago an it still hurts like u said we were friends,lovers,everything and she stop talking 2 me over a guy. an she probably misses u to she is just in love. you should try talking to her if u really miss her.|`|08jHtpffaa	your just going to have to wait it out. lo siento puquena chica.|`|oBRERF5paa	if she really is your best friend then she will be back, don't worry in order to be best friends there are going to be ups and downs.. An if you really care about her don't ever turn your back on her.. trust me you will regret it|`|TRrTunqvaa	my best friend of 5 years and i didnt talk for like 3 weeks, then she sent me this cute forward text message about "life's to short" and all this cute stuff so we started talking again|`|na8ObA5Haa	Never been through this... cause im not into girls like that.. but in your case this seems like more than just a "bestfriend fight" it sounds more like a break up to me, since you guys were (lovers) n everything. You just need to move on and find someone else, dont let this get to you. do your best to keep your mind off of her, Keep yourself busy! and time will heal everything. and always keep in mind EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON, whats meant to be will always find its way. :)
0ulKsvXlaa	First.....Stop crying  You are ruining your own life because of an *** hole.  This guy used you as an in-between, or to get even with his ex-girlfriend.  Ok, you've had many problems, but I advise you to get over him as fast as possible.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself, that only hurts you.    I know your a strong girl now, just look what you wrote.  "I'm a classy girl...I respect myself"  So you believe it.   You can do better than him,. I know this.  Deep inside you know it too, you've been through too much to let this put you down.  Cheer yourself up, get a new hairdo, or buy yourself a new outfit.  Then get out and enjoy yourself, you'll find someone before you can blink an eye.  Next time don't let things run too fast, If a man has to work for it, you'll know he's interested in more than just one thing.    Good luck beautiful|`|b7Ib3ZWQaa	im so sorry that he did that to you. just by reading what you've said, you seem to be a very smart and loving person. I'm also very sorry that you feel depressed and hurt. This guy seems like a jerk and he doesn't care about your feelings, even though he acted like he did. It sometimes feels like you only attract stupid, ignorant people. Which don't thing like that. There are plenty of people that would love to talk to and love you for who you are. Do not lower your standards. You have so much respect for yourself and have really excellent qualities. This guy is most likely going to call you and text you, and say "im sorry, take me back, i didn't mean to, i love you more...." blah blah blah. Don't believe anything he says. If it were me, I'd not have any contact with him. Ignore him. This is your life, not his. Get him out of it. I know, easier said than done, but don't give in. You need time to heal, and you need family and good friends there for you. Best of luck to you.|`|2aERh7hlaa	First of all it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders, I just wanted to start off with that. Now to your question. I'm 41 yrs old and I know that it is never a good idea to start a relationship with someone on the rebound. Sounds to me that he does love her but he was crushed by her actions, You came along and helped heal his heart. I don't think he did what he did to you on purpose and I would guess that the reason he's not talking to you is that he feels embarrassed for how he made you feel and he has no idea how to correct it. I can't tell you how to fix your heart but I ca tell you to hold your head high and to feel good about yourself because your compassion and your willingness to give of yourself helped to heal another, and trust me when I tell you that there are alot of good guys out there searching for those qualities.|`|AA10911598	Stand up tall and realize that you are worthy of having someone great beside you.  You did nothing wrong with this relationship!  You will find someone that deserves you if you keep on moving forward.  I am proud of you for overcoming extreme OCD problems and getting out and meeting someone.  You can do it again.  I am sorry this turned out poorly, but don't give up. I know life seems unfair when things like this happen.  It won't be long before he finds out that this girl will do it again and he will be looking over his shoulder for you.  Don't wait around.  You deserve happiness too.  I wish you all good things.|`|GcQEhep0aa	oh honey you need someone who  will be yours only. I know it hurts right now, but you need to move on and get over this guy.  what he did was wrong and please don't compare yourself to his drunken ex.  You will find a guy who will always be there for you and who will love you like crazy. This guy doesn't even talk to you as a friend anymore. this is a big clue for you to move on.  Please don't talk to him anymore and don't let him see that he hurt you.  a  classy girl doesn't do that. she has more respect for herself than to beg.  One last thing...always remember that you are worthy of being loved. hope this helps...ever need to talk feel free to email me.
qsfRMeNFaa	Well if i were you, wait till your married to have sex at all.  But if you are not that kind of person. Since this is a worldly world.  Communication is a must. and USE A DAMN CONDEMN or at least be on a pregnancy preventive. And yes be of Age, please. too many young mothers.  Ask for his opinion on if he thinks you are the right one he wants to lose his virginity too. DON'T pressure him though. Just kinda say "You know I really like you a lot, and I feel comfortable with you, But I was wondering if you want to take this to another level and it doesn't have to be exactly right now, but consider it and let me know what you think, take your time"  I don't know exactly what to say, but that's the best I could think of. It is always best to let someone have time to think something over before making a decision. Especially one like this one!  GOOD LUCK.|`|BUET39wmaa	you tell him  hey I am ready to have sex with you.  duh|`|HHyny0JSaa	Ask him how he feels about taking your relationship to the next level. But don't push the subject. When its right it will happen|`|LykjWv6faa	I hope you're of age, for one. And another, I  hope you both are truly ready and know what the repercussions are of engaging in sex. With all that said, just tell him. Communication is important in a relationship.|`|iu4SOin3aa	Next time yall are together, start making out and touch down in his pants. Then take his pants off and give him a bj. By that time, he should be in the mood to get it on. If he doesnt, then he might be scared, so just help him out. Tell him if he doesnt want to then thats okay, but he's a guy so i dont know why he wouldnt want to.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	You need to talk about several things with him first. What if you get pregnant? Would you want him to be the father? How would you feel if he left you without warning? Are you on any birth control at the moment? Will you have a condom ready for him? You may want to go ahead and get some in case it just happens spur of the moment as it often does.     Also consider how long you have been together. If it's less than 3 months or so, you may not know him well enough. Most people, girls anyway, can only truly enjoy sex with someone they love and are in love with and are maybe even planning a future with.|`|R00ad4yBaa	Go to Redtube.com and type in search lesbians and then play it and then pull his pants dwn and his peepee will go DOINGG!!! And then suck and slobb alll overr iittt!!!! UUUhhhh im getting horny just thinking  about it!!!!

Carry a condom with you at all times because when it comes to sex it can happen any time.|`|jVRvGDEMaa	seduce him, and watch few porn, to know different exciting positions|`|dI1oANPwaa	you can talk to him about it or make a move and see what he does from there if he not ready then he will let you know|`|705e4382c8a43a165a574c319b7d7b74aa	kiss him all passionate......... he'll def get it
g3tYfKaEaa	First of all you have to decided what you want. Do you want someone to be possessive? Next think about the context of the conversation you to had. Why was he telling you that? To give you a heads up? To try to prevent it from happening? As you mention that you had a reaction to the statement. He probably noticed that and knows it wouldn't go over well with you...     Possessiveness is not a sign of someone likes you. Possessiveness is a controling behavior and steams from a need to show dominance. Sometimes being dominate, is a tell tell sign of insecurities especially if it comes out excessively. What's his past like? People that are controling or possessive sometimes have issues that come with that like abandonment issues. You best shot at figuring this guy out is to identify possessive behavior, analyzis the situation in which the behavior occured and then try to see if it stems from a past situation. I agree with some of the other answers, it takes time to see someone's true colors but on the positive side, if he openly talked about it with you 1) he's being honest 2) he recongizes it as a problem in his life both are good signs.     Hope that helps.|`|4sK0aJlDaa	who cares u dont want a  possesive bf|`|Foz9RTdJaa	well he probably had bad experiences with his past gf they probabaly cheated on him and him not being like that probably means that he trust you|`|El36zZEYaa	Well... He Was drunk, so it may not have that much meaning.  But I think he's trying to warn you.  Like, he's starting to feel like being possessive with you, so watch out.  And some men think that's flirting to say to their girl, "I get jealous if anyone looks at you."|`|rHjzu6Axaa	he want 2 be diff n not try to run you off from the sounds of it don't worry|`|3uaIuxz8aa	One thing I've noticed about myself is that I too tend to be possessive of my boyfriends, but I'm with a guy now who I know is just as into me as I am into him. I think it's a trust thing. Maybe he didn't feel secure in those relationships and feels great with you. After 4 months if he's not possessive I'd guess that's the reason.    A guy who isn't into a girl isn't going to stick around for 4 months. I know that's not a REAL long time, but seriously if he's not possessive yet, and he's still around, he's probably WAY into you.|`|0L3tqpEVaa	I think Brandee L has the right idea.  It takes more than 4 months to see how a person will act.  I would shy away from someone who is over possessive.  I wish yo the best.|`|rzY4XM6gaa	no, I think you should be thankful!    Why on earth would you WANT a possessive bf/husband??  (Unless,  I guess if that's just your thing, maybe...)    I mean, that chick from the grudge had a possessive husband...and we all know what happened to her!|`|YIvIVvWFaa	It almost sounds like he was indirectly warning you. I hope he never gets possessive with you, as it is hard for a person to control himself when drunk, so it is probably not a case of his being possessive with former gfs, but refraining from it in your case. If that is really his true nature when drunk, sooner or later, it will probably put in an appearance, so be on the watch for signs of it--or, better yet, stop getting drunk together. What's the point of it?|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	I don't think it's you but him. My boyfriend claims to be extremely possessive but he controls it very well because he trusts me. I didn't even know until he told me that he was that possessive. I bet he just has control over it- and that he gets possessive inside and just doesn't show it because he's probably lost a girl over it.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Maybe he's trying not to be with you. It could have been a problem in his previous relationships. Or maybe it comes out after awhile.|`|aCCUQQu4aa	He may just trust you more than the others.  This is a very good thing.  Keep in mind, it is a good thing he is not being too possessive, I don't think you would be too happy if he were to try to control every aspect of your life.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	It could mean he feels secure in your realtionship, so feels no reason to mistrust you or maybe he's learned his lesson in past relationships that possessiveness can mean bad things for a relationship.    I wouldn't worry about it. It's a good thing.|`|VP8TiqEmaa	Man you girls are funny, first you hate it when he is possessive and then wish he was possessive.    But yea he probably doesn't care for you as much as he did for his exes     you could be a interim girlfriend|`|j0SozMmzaa	Everything is relative. He may be with you as he has been with others. For instance he thought or thinks he is possessive but relative to the way you think he is not. This could say great things for the relationship you have with each other.  You may be over thinking here?|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You want him to be possessive?  perhaps he is not as keen with you as he has been with others in the past but you should be glad he's not that way.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	maybe he really likes you and wants to keep you. you don't want him to be possessive trust me|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	maybe he realized that him being possessive isn't working, cause obviously he's not with those girls anymore|`|VYVOQfzOaa	4MONTHS ISN'T THAT LONG TO DETERMINE IF YOUR BF WILL BE CONTROLLING, GIVE IT MORE TIME, IF HE IS, IT WILL SHOW. CERTAIN THINGS COME TO LIGHT WITHIN 6MO. TO A YEAR IN RELATIONSHIPS|`|yStgi71jaa	time will show his "true colors"... be careful!|`|s3FWCRGxaa	thats a good thing, you shouldnt want a possesive boyfriend. maybe he hasnt let it out yet. or you havent given him reason to act that way.|`|7cpNW4VMaa	Listen to yourself ....he told you he is possesive and then he isnt with you and your complaining. leave the complaining until he has done something bad.    just be happy and stop thinking so much into dumb stuff
KPR0tQtfaa	just look her straight in the eye and tell her how your feeling. let her know that you don't like fighting over her weird and how she looks.
FaEoNy5Kaa	U only talk online? That's got to stop. Talking online is worse than not talking at all imo. Know why? Because he has enough time to sit and write an email or to chat using a keyboard-when he could just p/u a phone and relate to u in half the time. Next time u talk to him, tell him to call u. It's a lot easier to hide when u can't hear someone's voice. Then-just come out and ask him if he'd rather date other ppl. Don't worry about scaring him-cuz if he really likes u, he'll tell u he wants 2 b exclusive. Hope that helps!
HdFVRrdSaa	Chop Suey - System of a down|`|2hAuIg5baa	system of a down thats one of my favourite songs :)|`|D1crEj3caa	i hate that band -_- i used to like their music untill i heard them talk in an interview. i've never heard such retarded people.
MX1shAbcaa	Go to a lawyer or post this in a law category and try to see what you options are legally.  But if you don't want to do that then i recommend just talking to her and telling her how much you really really need that money and if she still doesn't give it to you then threaten to go to take it to court.  But, if she really has a reason that she cannot give it to you at the moment then hear her out.  ~William|`|AA12324252	Ask her if she'll talk too your lawyer about this and see what happens.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Who's we and unless you have it written down it is noncollectable|`|96827f15b3cc218a65143db6531a248daa	You aren't entitled to it if she paid your bills for a year.|`|dOd7UqvGaa	only way to get the money you entitled would be small claims court. since she filed it under her income tax, it would show up as hers with the IRS, and the police.|`|RLaTxDfJaa	u are pretty much screwed honey. if u take it to court your sister will win. 1. because she has the right to claim u because u lived under her roof providing she supported u. 2. if she did not support u and claimed u then it is fraud and that is a whole nother issue which gets the family all involved because that's what families do. u could at least threaten ur sister with a lawyer tho.|`|jbl1j56gaa	small courts, but you'd need to have witnesses or something proving that she said shed give you the money.
HfVREDSyaa	I would marry someone even if they didn't want kids... I mean.. it may end up being a problem laterish... but if I really loved them it wouldn't matter... I'd just want to be with them and want to be spending the rest of my life with Them anyway. :]|`|saxXq7L1aa	I say go for it.  Just because they dont want kids now doesn't mean their opinion won't change sometime.    It may depend on the reason they don't want kids  Maybe they don't want to have them, because they do want to HAVE them  But of course there are other options    Listen, just do what your heart tells you, and if it says to be with that person than do it.|`|XJaH1rqraa	I wouldn't marry someone who does not want kids. I've always wanted a few myself, and I think it helps people to strengthen their relationship and think more about others instead of spending all their money on themselves. Plus, you get unbiased love!|`|nKKi1hANaa	wow you are a total jerk! what kind of person dosn't want kids? how selfish is that?|`|keNFLjG3aa	absolutely a big no-no...because i want somebody to cuddle to,and depends on me in everything....|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You also end up richer cos kids cost a fortune.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	Me personally, no. But this is so general that one answer can't answer. Although I am not baby obsessed, I do love kids and have one myself. I never wanted kids until I ended up pregnant and now I wouldn't trade her for the world and neither would my husband. =) Having kids isn't petty.|`|AA11441704	no|`|LykjWv6faa	I honestly think that the kid issue is a big factor between married couples. If one person wants kids while the other doesn't, the one that does may resent the other. Ideas clash and the marriage will probably end. Isn't that the point of getting married? To start a family?|`|ZA11WBR2aa	No, I would only marry a woman if she wants kids, although our relationship is more important but kids are important for me too.|`|aCCUQQu4aa	There are many other men whose lives have been enriched by them...my husband gets lucky more often now than before we had kids...you won't hear him complain.    Needless to say, I would break it off, but I agree, you should be with someone who is like minded.  There is no point in trying to "change" someone.  It will never happen.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	i love kids and i wish one day i could have one or 2
ecNeN0staa	GROSS!|`|iufAPDeWaa	Whatever it is sounds disgusting. Don't do it.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	Hey girl, listen if its something unsanitary, disgusting, something that puts your health on the line, tell her to get lost. If she'll use the friend card, REAL FRIENDS DON"T DO THAT SH&&&&T to their friends|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	Ew, I think you should have never entered this bet in the first place!! Thats gross, I on the other hand, don't mind feet, I'm in school for Cosmetology and have to touch feet constantly, so I don't exactly feel your pain ha.  But Use you, i think means gang rape you =D|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Well, I have mixed feelings about this.    One one hand, you don't want to bruise your dignity and degrade yourself with these orders    but on the other hand, you want to go through with it because you lost a bet.    If you're going to go through with this bet, do it with absolute confidence and just brush your shoulders off.    If you do, that's respectable!  Props!|`|YwaZMnnGaa	hey its better then smelling a unshowered vag.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	haha of course i would .. you lost .. suck it up lol
Yzcptoagaa	You already set the record straight and were honest with him.  It doesn't sound like he's violent or "stalkerish."  So just let him be mad for a while.    When you dump a man, you wound his pride.  There's no way around it.  If you are extra nice to him in a "just friends" sort of way to try and ease your own conscience, you'll just make him more mad.  The decent thing to do here is actually to let him hate you for a little while.  Don't be mean, just don't treat him like he needs your pity.|`|sK4S86piaa	Be honest! But try saying out words that could be understood easily so it won't get complicated in the conversation..most importantly, be polite & say it like you really mean it. Tell him that you are very sorry - you have felings for him but it doesn't just work out the way you both wanted it to. I'm sure he will understand that..leaving it is just something you shouldn't do..he should know how you feel..how his perspective of you in the past that is entirely wrong..i would stop a relationship if i know that it's not gonna work..so just be yourself & tell the truth.|`|hdYgdu0oaa	You need to say something, this gets rid of any unanswered questions, which leads to awkwardness.  Just be honest with him, with what you want and dont want....and be pleasant.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	First you never date anybody you work with. And since its done just leave it and give him time he should come to terms with it and feel better.|`|I2gat01haa	you should just talk to him and tell him what you feel.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	there really is nothing you can do..just don't let it bother you and he may not bring it up....but it should be very awkward for a while. ..|`|1uv8wjvYaa	theres never an easy way but open with the ex is good.Take the blame that helps men hate to admit its them atleast you let him down a little easier and move on.|`|zXGv5lGPaa	Just b cool. just walk up to him slowly and say "hey could i talk to you?" if he say no, wait till he calms down a bit and wait a day, or evan an hour. if he says yes, than discuss your feelings and why u broke up wit him.. but say it very friendly like. trust me. this happened 2 me B4. if u get into a little fight, try 2 find some way to stop it B4 it gets into a bigger fight.   Hope this helped! :)|`|RLaTxDfJaa	just leave it alone if u are truly done. he has to work out his own feelings. remain professional with him and time will heal the tension.|`|362adadcf07b8c4be23f083bb0e84126aa	let him know how you feel over coffee or lunch... clear the air, dont let it affect your work|`|Mg5JKObKaa	I think if you broke it off and both of you know it's OVER and the reasons why, then there is no need for you to go back and tell him anything. People get angry when things like this happen. It's normal. He'll eventually get over it (and you will, too.) But, if you feel you really need to, just call him on the phone or meet up with him and explain exactly why you think things didn't and won't work out and say your official "byes."
SAKw2nnkaa	its hard being lonely and yes sometimes you do get tierd of being lonley cuz ive been lonlye for the past 5 days and i am just tierd of it|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Very. Im sick of it actually. Very very sick of it. Im done crying over matters like these.|`|Q3ldbCdtaa	i had momments like that before but you should always know that everything happens for a reason. you never know anyone can be right around the coner for you or anyone in this matter.

The drive to be intimate with someone is in our hierarchy of needs. We NEED to be loved. However, we are able to survive if we don't have it all the time. I know that it may be hard, but you just need to relax and it will come to you when the time is right. You can not rush time, hence, you can not rush love or intimacy. Confide in people that care about you in a different way and I can almost guarantee you that once you become comfortable in yourself and the others that really love you that the intimate love that you crave will catch you off guard. Keep your head high and don't give up, but don't waste any time thinking why because there are way too many things in life that you have not seen or known; In that time that you are contemplating what is wrong with you, you could be ENJOYING YOURSELF!!! The point that I am trying to make is that you need to know and love yourself before you can find the one that is right for you.
pUvEmPrCaa	You need to be socializing more.  Going out and 'looking' for someone always leads to finding the wrong people.  You can't be on a witch hunt for your soulmate.  You need to get out and socialize and meet new people and when the right person or even a decent person for you to have a relationship and a connection with comes up, you will know and it will just click.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Find out why you choose the girls that you do. Its usually linked to something in your past. Write down or take a mental note of what you actually bring to the relationship, contact some ex's and find out what you did wrong in the relationship. Change those things. Then write down, or make a mental note of the things you want out of a woman. Realize that sex before commitment (not necessarily marriage) is going to make things challenging. And do what you gotta do. Dating is suppose to be find. If you are looking for a life partner, date a few women at a time respectfully, and that way you have variety. Try stepping out of your bubble a little bit and go after a girl that you normally wouldn't go for. I know this sounds crazy, but ask a good friend or even a family to set you up. I know that sounds crazy, but they are on the outside looking in and can be more objective in choosing someone, and they probably know what you give and what you need, so they would be better at picking them for you. Just let them know that you are serious about finding someone so that they don't just pick anyone. Let them know that you are trusting them to help you find mrs. right! Try some of those things, and don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen right away. I'd rather be lonely because I didn't settle, or lonely from a divorce because I knew deep down that someone wasn't for me.|`|X5fEQGgNaa	Chris,    you have two choices here.  see, you are the male equivalent of those women that always pick the abusive, thick-headed, no-good boyfriends when a decent guy is waiting for her to realize he's scum.    option 1 - you hereby relinquish all decision making abilities when it comes to relationships and find a trusted friend to become your proxy for dating.  all thoughts and decisions are processed by your proxy.    option 2 (and this is what i think you should do) - remove yourself from the dating pool as you have stated.  not only is it the safe path, but for someone who is so clearly a loser, it is also the proper path.  you know those people who live alone with no family or friends and who were never married and thus don't have kids?  that could be you.  think of the bright sight dude - you won't have to support a nagging wife and ungrateful, rat bastard children.  it's all you buddy.  all the time.  you're free from the slavery called marriage.  i, for one, say you go for it.    best of luck mate,    Mayor McCheese|`|bkd4e4abaa	they say its better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all, on the flip side if you cant be content by yourself then you most likely wont be satisfied long term with a partner,  long story is to be a man learn to be happy by without a significant other and then either way you will be happy|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Sometimes things fall apart so that better things can happen! That is a quote I heard somewhere and it applies to so many things in life.  To experience joy and love you sometimes have to have the pain to get to it.  I say get out there and give it a try.  The only way to find happiness with that perfect someone is to try many.  It's kinda like trying on clothes. Sometimes they look great on the rack then you try them on and they don't fit right. You just have to try on more and eventually you will find the one that fits and looks great on you.  Same with dating, most of the time you know right away if it is right, don't try to force things, if it is meant to be it will happen.  The safe way is to be alone, but you will miss so much and never fill that lonely spot.  Don't be afraid!  Good luck!!!!!|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	military is always an option|`|CzAwjF76aa	I think you should try again but be smart about it. if you keep picking the worng type of person over and over, figure out what attracted you and where it went wrong. Then look for someone without those qualitys. A good way to try this is a dating site that does a comprehensive personality anaylis of who you are and what you are truely looking for in a mate. Then helps you find someone like that.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Well dating is how we find out who is right and who is not. Unfortunately we get hurt and we hurt other people but at the end we are to be happy with the right person. But real love will come you don't have to look for it. Be patient and see what happens naturally.|`|AA11441704	You fail, you rise...........you meet someone............face it.|`|3UlGItEEaa	Stay away from  the dating game for a while. You are not in the right state of mind and might sabotage the relationship before it has time to grow. Enjoy life with friends and family. enjoy whatever it is that you do. Forgive and move on from the past and you will find that with healing and time, the right person will come along.      I am working on that too, believe it or not.|`|ecNeN0staa	Fill the empty hole by filling empty holes.|`|2aERh7hlaa	There is only one person who can tell you if your ready and I think it's obvious who that is. I hope you find your answer.|`|AA12004844	get back out there dating, but do not go for the same type of person you usually go for.    A lot of times we go out with a person similar to whatever parent wew had difficulty with - so you may want to examine that.    Go for someone that you would not normally go for and give them a chance.    good luck
v6KI6iygaa	Hey sweetie, firstly sorry about the end of your relationship with your boyfriend.    Ok so, it sounds like this guy is either playing games, or has lost interest or has found someone else maybe.  Either way, you need to forget about this guy.  Just go out there and get yourself some guy friends, and see how it goes from there.  Talk to guys in your classes, tutorials, or get to know friends-of-friends.  Just be friendly, send some subtle flirting vibes and see if they are reciprocated...if they are, go from there sweetie! You'll find yourself someone, I promise you of that.  I was in a very similar situation to yourself, when a guy aquaintance of mine and me started to get a little bit closer and now we're together 3 years!  Relationships don't have to be serious to begin with, just have friends, some casual dating and then see where it goes.  If this guy that you like comes back into your life, you can then make a decision whether you want to date him.  But for the time being, find yourself someone else, and be happy without him! Good luck sweetie :)|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	how can you NOT meet people in college?  arent there hundreds of people there?  ??|`|YuF9Jp4gaa	Just look pretty, im sure any guy will notice you.|`|lvjAxFGxaa	wthruta
OQsj0Am3aa	Just tell him the truth.    Just say- I might be wrong but I kind of get the impression that (insert girls name here) doesn't like me, and I didn't want to cause any hassle for you now that you're back together, but if you think she's cool then let's chat.|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	I think you should still talk to him, I'm friends with soo many guys that have girlfriends, that HATE me, but I honestly dont care, if I want to be friends with someone, then I will be!!
MOQXdaZMaa	dont do it|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	If your asking you are not ready because its your body and if you do it by being pressured it will devastate you and you will be upset with yourself for a long time. Tell him NO and if he cares for you he will wait until your ready and if he doesn't want to wait guess what honey he was going to dump you after anyway. Your a smart girl listen to your inner self.|`|aPSDksshaa	don't, wait till you want too.|`|9w9eXmpBaa	The fact that you're questioning it shows that you're not ready.  When you know there is no question about it and it's what you want to do . . . THATS WHEN YOU'RE READY!    Don't let him push you into something that you're not ready for otherwise he's not the right person for you.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	You shouldn't be scared but if you are not ready then DON'T DO IT!  Don't let him pressure you into it.  If you do you will be sorry.   It sounds to me like you need to wait.  If he loves you he will wait until you are ready. Just be prepared to find out that the only thing he wanted out of you was sex.
b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	figure out and focus on your goals, both career-wise and personally.  then commit to doing things that will bring you closer to those goals and NOT other things.  i.e. if you want a long-term relationship, dont go on 2nd dates with men who are looking to just play. get rid of them.  if you want to buy a house, don't get starbucks 5 times a week; cut it down to 2 times and save those extra bucks.  now is a time to really form the life you want. you've already been through enough that you're probably smart and somewhat intuitive. just trust yourself and make good decisions.|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	don't cheat  don't forgive if a man cheats on you  don't hang out with a man who is not serious about you  don't run after a crush if you have stable relationship  don't give up your job because of a man|`|Bsf78pfsaa	Take one day at a time and dont think about what you havent accomplished look at what things you will be able to do|`|pwejv6jpaa	stop bitching and get your self together.
EtCRnDJMaa	then find another girlfriend.  How hard is that?  Why stay with somebody who you"think" is cheating on you?  If you feel this way now, you'll always feel this way about her.  Who needs that?|`|joDZLoc0aa	Well first of all ask her. If she denies it trust her, without trust there can be no relationship...and try to get to know her male friends. I had this problem and we made a fake account and got to know "the friends" and got to know their secrets.|`|LykjWv6faa	Make her wear a chastity belt.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	huh!  she told me that she was thinking that same thing about YOU!    how does she make sure that you never have sex or cheat in anyway or talk to any girl ever again?  huh? how does she do that?|`|PIuCdeC4aa	Well, considering she has been fairly promiscuous in the past, she may be prone to cheating.  That is just a connection I make, though, not everyone falls into this category.      All you can do is assume that your love is beyond physical, and hope she can control herself.  You shouldn't worry that she has a lot of male friends on social networking sites.  That sounds paranoid, and if she realizes you have looked through her friends, she will be very angry.    Good luck with your situation.|`|x88DfLokaa	i agree with karkie.. why stay with someone you dont trust.. you obviously have trust issures with her.. even tho you guys are on the same level.. and yeah just cause shes always on myspace  doeasnt mean shes cheating
I0rOL46aaa	Offer people help if they look like they need it, always have a smile on, even if it's only the very corners of your mouth tipped up, and be friendly!  Talk to everyone and ask them questions about what they've told you to prove that you were listening.  Make confident eye contact, and make sure you talk about them first, gradually adding little bits of information about yourself.  If they seem like they're uncomfortable answering personal questions, just talk about homework or school or, if you two are both on a sports team, about the last game/practice.  And don't come on too strong, just gradually start talking to everyone.  If someone insults you, don't insult them back.  Don't even make a snide remark in return.  But, at the same time, don't become one of those Sunday-school goodie two shoes.  Find a good balance between the two.|`|hb1H5XAyaa	talk to people. people love talking about themselves, so compliment them, and ask them about them or something.|`|ph8lttZBaa	Become more involved in school activities.  Walk up to people you don't know and introduce yourself!|`|zhk8o514aa	What does this have to do with Apple shampoo?|`|96827f15b3cc218a65143db6531a248daa	Make them feel insignificant.|`|2ubfofmHaa	get off the computer and talk to people
fC8OPOTkaa	I would like to know that too but im not pretty, skinny or have a good personality (im boring) so theres my reason why i cant get a bf.  xx|`|pwejv6jpaa	depends how old the guy is.     high school the answer is yes. pretty and have a nice body if you want to be with one of the "cool kids"|`|FFq37ZgXaa	your all big liars.  I mean, you will only go and talk to someone if there good looking, and will stay away if there ugly no matter how nice they are.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	No matter what you look like, you will be somebody's type.  Looks will only take you so far.

Some guys don't find skinny women attractive at all. Some guys do. But honestly, I think you are a little suspect in asking this question. If you are heavier and don't deny it, maybe you should do something about it. Old but good saying... Looks get you the interview, the personality sells it.|`|rXhWL8pcaa	if i don't think your hot or at least okay, i will not hit on you.     If i do get to know you, and your not my type but cool than i'll get with you. At the same time, like i have said, you cant be ugly.    Well, there is always some one that will like what you got. i have a boy that looks almost exactly like be, but he got with some thick girl.  the was a WTF moment. the most important part is that by friend is happy.
OQsj0Am3aa	Go to the swarovski crystal shop and get her some jewellery.|`|opZXT2UMaa	Maybe some fancy makeup or perfume set, gift voucher, earrings/bracelet, a handbag/purse etc.|`|n7rfbfGmaa	Buy her a LoveLinks charm bracelet, they make gorgeous gifts.  I have one myself as i got it as a confirmation present from my parents, but i've given some to friends for special occasions. My mums friend has one to, and she recently got her a really sweet friendship charm for her to add to it.  Go to- http://www.cblovelinks-uk.co.uk/bracelet...  first buy her the actual bracelet, LOADS to choose from, and make sure you get roughly the right size.  Then you can choose a couple of charms (she can keep adding charms)   you can get zodiac signs, and lovely glass beads, there are tons to choose from!  I recommend these!  Hope I help :)
MX1shAbcaa	No you should not apologize, our at least i would not. Invasion or privacy she should apologize to you. I would apologize to my father and step mom because that had to here it but i wouldn't apologize to her.   If they keep bringing it up tel them that she should never have went through your WHOLE cell phones with out saying a word to you.  ~William|`|8fyEZtyNaa	my personal opinion is, that one should NEVER apologize if they are not sorry.    honestly. a forced apology is meaningless. its not going to stop you from doing it again anyways.    personally i think your sis owes YOU the apology for messing with your stuff.    explain you feelings and the whole incident. but dont let them win, by apologizing.    throwing around "sorrys" will only cause you more trouble.    dont feel bad for what you did. nothing worse than being guilt tripped. you have to show your sis and step mom, that she cant just read your stuff, and then make YOU feel like the villain.|`|nCbtZAIoaa	Uhm, well if this was me I would explain the situation of what happend, I would say that your step sister was reading through your messages, but you need to apolgize. You see, imagine you had a daughter and you found out that your daughter, was swearing and talking about other people, yeh I know to you it dosen't seem a big deal but I would take it seriously as if any parent would. But don't go on and say it's not my fault, she read through my messages. You need to say something like, Im really really sorry! I shoulden't of sent any of theese messages. Because that's the honest truth and you know that, listen to what they say and show them that you can be mature. Good luck!|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	do as your dad ask but demand an apology from her for invading your privacy|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Here's where you're wrong. You said if she had never read them then this would not have happened. Actually, if you had never written them this never would have happened. This is on you.|`|dOd7UqvGaa	she should apologize to you. not the other way around.|`|gcX1XzrMaa	You could apologize on the outside,but in the inside if you don't want to forgive her don't.  I wouldn't if i were you.|`|TUmPXl3Paa	i think that your messages, contacts, and pics are yours and only yours, so no one should really be going through them. not even our step sis, because thats just rude. i think she should be the one to apoligize because she obviously doesnt respect your privacy and by the looks of it, her boredom got you in a big mess that i think shes held responsible. if she really sees you as a close person and as her step, she shouldnt be getting you into such things. but its not as if other people dont send texts with curses and insults around, i think its a normal thing for anyone, even though its mean and disrespectful. but on the other hand, if you just want to forget the whole thing and move on, then maybe you should apoligize. but really, step sis going through your phone and then ratting you out, mmmeeesseeddd uuupppp|`|bd6ccf90e52a700aa3006e851be4a938aa	Here's what I would do- gather all involved parties- your stepsister, your father, and your stepmother (you can leave your Driving Instructor out of this one). Sit them down at a table making sure your sister-in-law is by your side, and give them a short introduction. Something to the effect of, "I understand that certain members of this family are aggrieved and upset at events that have recently transpired. For that reason, I would now like to apologize... for the butt whooping I'm about to administer!"    At that clock your step-sister in the face as hard as you can and start pulverizing the crud out of her until your father or step mother steps into break it up. As they pull you away start yelling out, "don't you ever mess with my stuff, don't you ever invade my privacy!" and keep at it. She'll get the idea.
suVd8lxXaa	I have been there yea it will work out just relax first about your ex I dated a girl for like 4 years from the time I was 16 to 20 when we broke up I didn't date hardly at all for some time and yes its normal to care about your ex and who she is dating it would be great to not care but one day you will care a bit less than the day before then one day you really wont care just move at your own speed it will turn around I promise and as far as the no sex don't worry about it there is no normal just do what you think is right and forget what anyone else thinks when its right you will know it and go for it|`|NdrO7u79aa	It's totally normal to go through a dry spell with no sex at that age. Don't worry about it. You'll meet the right girl when you least expect it, and things will work out just fine.    If the no sex has got you down that badly, just hit up the pub and drop a couple quid on a fat girl. They all look the same with the lights off, right?|`|ecNeN0staa	Just screw the pants off of like 10 different girls and gets some more experience under your belt.  You're only 19 - - enjoy life!|`|pmEDld6Zaa	dude, i am in this EXACT same situation. EXACT, i broke up with my GF of 3 years exactly a year ago, and still haven't really gone out with anyone else.  im in college now and i think im just gonna try and start to be forward, and if you really want to be with a girl or in a relationship make a true effort.|`|XBIEsFxfaa	I may not be older, but I will answer as someone who is in the same situation.  I was in a relationship for three years and it ended in Aug 07.  I then spent a year on and off in those social relationships.  Recently, I met another girl and fell in love.  She used and abused me and I let her.  She cheated on me twice and just this week I said goodbye for good.  Love?  I can say without a doubt I love her.  It's normal for this to happen.  I understand, I have a good life and a lot of things going for me right now, but no girl.  Life happens.  You just need to keep going day by day and I guarantee you will be surprised when she does come into your life.  You don't necessarily have to go looking for it, but just be open to it so when it does come you will be ready for it.
72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	you want him to be more romantic - tell him up and straight.  dropping hints does not help  ask him to do it for you  he will ask his mate - so don't expect anything too good.    occasionally ask him to watch a romantic film with you and see if he has any new ideas     the problem you have here is to do more with you than your guy - you want something from him that isn't natural to him and doesn't really affect the quality of the relationship in any way (it's just a bonus).    Btw, romanticism is not something that guys are into - so if they are, they are either master seducers or gay.    As a guy, you can bet one of my hobbies is not reading romantic books or watching romantic films. This is all girl stuff and it's where all the ideas and desperation started from initially. Then your mates get into the mood and made it a social requirement, unnecessary for a descent relationship.    Another thing you might want to understand is that romanticism is an ideal, not reality. If he doesn't do it right, then it's just natural; don't give him too much pressure or expect too much. Even the slightest gesture takes a lot out of him. He will be thinking of a romantic dinner or sending you flowers but he will not think about all the little stuff you will be obsessing about nor will he understand why (it's a guy thing).    hope this helps|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Explain to him that you need him to show some romantic style affection because it is just what you need. If he cant do it to please you he is just selfish and should be sent packing. Relationships are about taking care of each other and are a two way street.|`|DMzH5kbkaa	Maybe he is just shy? Feels like you won't like all the romantic stuff. Speak to him and make plans with him that you'd like to do which are romantic; i always have nights in with my boy; just cuddle up and watch a film and sometimes go out for a meal or just go cinema :) (reason why i don't see how he can of done sh!t like the person said to me today :|)  It's valentines day soon so use that as a way to start making your relationship how you want it to be :) - my ex was like how your boyfriend is - he'd say the sweetest things to me but he'd never do anything romantic unless it involved him getting sex out of it :| lol - not really romantic, ha.  Hope it all works out for you two :) keep smiling.|`|yKpMQZoZaa	Try to tell him straight up, if hints don't work. Try watching a movie together when the guy in a relationship is really romantic, and say something like "hey, that's really sweet, what he's doing. Do you wanna try that sometime, looks fun" or something. But say it in a sweet way so he doesn't look offended. Or say "how come you don't do that" but in a nice way  Good Luck  and thanks for answering mine!  X
ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	just keep doing what you're doing  i think that is just the way it is  maybe you could try to do something to cheer him up?  and if he needs to talk, listen...i don't think prying would be the best  good luck
NdrO7u79aa	It's never too late. At 16, relationships start and end all the time. He'll be single again soon, and if you really want to pursue it, you'll get your chance.    The one thing you have to keep in mind is how much you value his friendship. If you decide to become more than friends and it doesn't work out, is that worth the risk of losing him completely?|`|e98RKB35aa	It is never too late. Most likely he will break up with this person. It never hurts to tell him how you feel about him. Tell him that you care for him very much and would hate to see him hurt. Tell him then that if you were with me I would never hurt you. See where that goes.|`|0L3tqpEVaa	Jeremy said the same thing I would have said.    I hope for you the only best.|`|BlZSrsrmaa	u 2 hav had a connection since the time youv met  trust me i had 1of those and sometimes i regret it soo mch that i dint do anything about my male freind and now hes going to get married to sum next girl but i kno he has feelingz 4me cz he always says i love u and then laughs it offf lol    but u should do something bout it        ana my question please|`|mbjKBTvtaa	he was not that into u|`|PjlhgQ3uaa	its never to late and as a male i felt the need to answer it :D as soon as they brake up you jump in because unless they really love each other it lasts up to 4 weeks anyway , but if you do go out with him cause you do really when you brake up don't fight , take it , and don't write stupid things on msn saying you'll love them forever because it just makes you want to end life , and then don't send your gfs to get him cause it does scare him and its not going to change Liam's mind so stop picking on me with your devil chav Friends :D SORRY THAT LAST BIT WAS MY OWN NARRATION ! :P

Jai Hind|`|2535d508b3aaa170227c46319bed2477aa	Well I'm biased because I'm a white guy who thinks Indian girls are crazy hot and would love to meet a UK based East Indian girl like there is no tomorrow.  But honestly, it seems to me that both East Indian culture and Western culture Caucasians value education and hard work, which is an agreement on a pretty basic level.  Additionally, my own spiritual beliefs get along much better with a liberal Hindu than a conservative Christian (I've worked with both), so I would not immediately dismiss a Hindu woman as theologically incompatible with westerners either.  If you have some common interests and are both open minded people, I don't see any reason that you should not give it a try.    It seems like you are mainly expressing insecurity in your communication skills and citing that as a reason to avoid him. I don't think this is a good reason.  Your language will improve dramatically if you do get involved with him - I know from dating a woman who I spoke only Spanish with that my Spanish improved a ton.  What was even stranger was that someone on the street could say something in Spanish that I did not understand, but then she could look at me and repeat it and I understood her.  What I'm getting at is that your communication with him will likely improve a lot if you let yourself get closer to him.  You will also feel more comfortable in UK culture with more time, so I think you should go for it.... Oh yeah and I wish I were him :-)
GsrLh50laa	You can get everything you need to file for divorce without an attorney at in NC at - http://www.legalformsbank.biz/unconteste...|`|701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	Google for divorce papers in your county.  Apparently you are not talking to the right person in that office.  Call back up there and ask for the supervisor and tell her what you need.  I just bet the other person is real new on the job and does not know what you need.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	My advice is to get an attorney.  The clerk is right, telling you what forms you need IS giving legal advice, and by law they cannot do that.  Case in point, I was called awhile back by someone trying to do their own divorce.  They paid $400 for the forms, and when they arrived, they were all completely blank with no instructions.  Now they have to pay an attorney anway to do what those forms were supposed to do and are out $400.  If you insist on doing it yourself, be prepared to shell out more money for an attorney to fix what you screwed up.  You wouldn't take out your own appendix even if you were broke, so why would you want to be your own attorney?  Call around, there are attorneys who will work with you on payments.  EDIT: It is not that simple.  A complaint needs to be filed and served on both people.  Once the complaint is filed, you have to wait 30 days for the other person to file an answer, then and only then, can the divorce be scheduled.  There are legal documents that have to be drafted, there is no blanket form for the divorce.  I suggest you either hire an attorney or go to law school.
AQ3QqA5daa	ok so I know how you feel. I feel that way about someone too but I think it best to maybe scale back a little what contact you have with him? Let him miss you and realise he wants all the contact.    Also allows you to be able to make sure toher parts of your life don't suffer.    Also remeber if he's serious expensive gifts are not the thing...thoughtful ones are. If he wants nothing more than you for the day then do that. If he wants something get him that and make it persoanl as opposed to an xbox that anyone can buy really.     Sounds like he likes you alot so try and chill (i know it's hard) and ejoy rather than obsess! :-)|`|OQsj0Am3aa	You're acting like a stalker !    Stop sending him cards. Guy's aren't big on that kind of mushy crap.  Try cutting back on how much you spend. Reduce your texts to twice a day. 1 at lunch and 1 at night. If he responds with a question then go for it and text back but if he doesn't just leave it.    He'll be more interested if you back off a bit and seem a bit hard to catch.|`|2mvg1TUQaa	don't text him so much. guys don't like all that mushy stuff. and don't spend to much money on him. you should just back off a little and give him space. don't really let him come to you but meet him half way. don't be to clingy.|`|DkwgogXZaa	he needs his space thats all
u49dfBkDaa	maybe i'm weird, but i'd think my bf was sweet if he said that. if you know for sure she'll be angry with you about this, i'd do the pass out thing. If not, just tell her that you love her and your unborn daughter so much, you don't want to risk anything happening.|`|hIrBZS3oaa	Seriously.....getting drunk and passing out as an excuse.  That's low.    Just do it.  I'm sure she's slept with you when SHE wasn't in the mood before.  Just to make you happy.  You can return the favor.     My advice:  Keep these feelings to yourself.  You don't want a g/f, let alone a pregnant g/f getting a whiff of those thoughts.  Your butt will thank me later :-)|`|UyNa0XEKaa	Oh, wow..... you really need to try to get over that. Getting really **** faced on Valentine's Day....bad idea. You need to talk to your girlfriend, let her know you feel a little uneasy about it. For her sake, I hope she can make u feel comfortable with it. It's bad enough having to deal with being pregnant, but also having to deal with your man not wanting to have sex with you.  Women go through a lot of emotions when their pregnant. She needs to feel you still want her.|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	First you should talk to her about it. There are other forms of sex than just sex. You could do all the other stuff on valentines day and she probably would still be just as satisfied. Just make sure you don't trigger any bad emotions- make sure she knows it's entirely because of the baby.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Um.. no offense but get over it.    This is when SHE needs you man    SteveC|`|ZPDb4KRXaa	Just tell her, I mean she will not be totally pissed off. Yeah she will want to do something, but explain what is happening, and let her know you are not comfy. She should respect that and you can have sex when the baby is born.|`|joDZLoc0aa	Just tell her how you feel. Don't mention you wouldn't mind if it was a boy. Just say that your not comfortable being with her while a baby is inside her.|`|x88DfLokaa	well... i dont think ive ever heard this problem before.. normally it doesnt really matter./. but alot dog guys for some reason dont want to have sex when they know theres a child in there... but to be honest.. the child is wayy in there and im sure she wont see ot feel anything.. so do your wife a favor.. shes been carring a child and im sure she doesnt feel all that muvch attractive right now.. so by you turning her back shes gonna feel worse.. have sex with your wife on valentines day.|`|LWvh2g2maa	I just don't get what what your deal is.  What does the sex of the baby have to do with anything?  Hell, it may not even really be a girl.  It's not 100%, ya know.  The doctors are just guessing.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Have you ever seen Knocked Up?  Where the guy doesn't want to have sex with his girlfriend because he's afraid the first thing the baby was going to see was going to be his penis?    This just shows that you are completely uneducated.  Your daughter is NOWHERE near your girlfriend's clitoris.  Her uterus won't even feel it.  And your daughter will definitely not feel or remember it.      You need to just get over it, remember how much you love your girlfriend and why you love her, and have sex with her.

(Meaning, does getting kissed behind the ears turn him on, kissing on the neck, or whatever his hot spot is)|`|PRUXtYh5aa	Get the book 'Hot Sex' or one of the follow-ups by Tracey Cox and ask a bunch of the questions that are in there.  I have never read a book that nails it (no pun intended) better than this one.  I'm thinking of using it as a way to improve our sex life, much like your survey.  My wife gave it to me for Christmas, which finally shows some effort on her part and if we use it as a guide, we may learn a lot about what we desire and enjoy now.  Getting one another to try everything is a task in itself.|`|na8ObA5Haa	Favorite sex position?:    Kinky or not kinky?:    Favorite sexual fruit?:    Favorite song to have sex too?:    Favorite Lubricant?:    Favorite adult film?:    do you like Role play?:    if so, what character do you want to be?:    If i asked you to talk dirty to me, what would you say?:      & so on and so on, just ask questions like that. Maybe it will spice up your love life a lil bit :)

But, to me it looks like you are extremely possesive/ overprotective of her and probably jealous of her which makes you hate her boyfriends.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	You are in dire need of psychological help. I urge you to go for counseling with a licensed therapist. You are troubled and without professional help you life will completely unravel. There are reasons your parents told you to leave. There are reasons they do not believe you when you tell them things. More so, there are reasons you are so obsessed with your sister to the point where you do not want her to be involved with someone else. It sounds like there is a great deal of dysfunction in your family. Seek professional help. The road to recovery is long and difficult but it is worth it as you will emerge happy and healthy both mentally and emotionally. Best of luck.|`|HmjQdewMaa	I think you are very loving and caring person. But some times love manifests in a different way. You have to understand it carefully to, overcome it..|`|HCn2iyhSaa	well if your feeling in a bad manner then u must stop thinking about her and lleave her as it is, but if ur feeling in otherway round and u dont want that, would be cheated or any bad thing happen to her, u shill never give up and try to hold on her boyfrnd, and pretend as her( your sister) as a gaurd.|`|nt39zop3aa	start liking another girl or find ur self a bf|`|aIF5mGrZaa	wtf is wrong with you...  Ew thats disgusting.  Get over her it's incest!|`|3MurocTSaa	hahahaha. incest is best. why go across the street when you can go across the hall. pervert.
AA11100518	i think that you need to find out things like do you want to have kids?  does he want to have kids?  will he move for your job?  will you move for his job?  how will things work if he is retired 20 years before you.  will you expect him to clean house and is he willing?  interests tend to change with age, young people enjoy being with others and partying and going out more.  older people tend to do this less.  the problem is not the age per se but you are at different stages of life.  does he have children?  are they teens?  how will you be at dealing with them?  it can work but yes, usually they will die and you will be a widow at a fairly young age, more often the case is that you grow up and get independent and the relationship can't change to accommodate that.    you may have to take care of him when he's old, yes, but that is part of being with someone.  are you willing?  would he take care of you if you became disabled (which is also possible).  does he have expectations of women that are different than yours (there are often generational differences).  so you need to talk to him about all these things.  it's not the age difference that matters, its the life choices you will be making together.  it's just a little easier whenyou are at more the same stage.  the having or not having babies issue is probably the biggest.  dealing with his children is the 2nd biggest.  social patterns are the 3rd biggest--ie will he be up for the soccer cookout?|`|Uxdiv3fdaa	I think it matters if you are under 18   but if you are older 25 it does not matter anymore|`|UZsSWMupaa	well for some people age is a factor but if you like someone because of whop they are and not there age it shouldn't really matter i mean i dated a guy who was 20 and i am 15 but if your family has a problem with it then maybe you should reconsider this i mean you are 18 and you in college you still have a whole life ahead of you before you should be engaged and whatever|`|aymBTRlyaa	How do YOU feel about it?    Does it secretely make you uncomfortable? Are you trying to rebebl against your family? Is the relationship with your dad a good one?      I don't think it'd be good to date him because what can you have incommon. From 18-25 you learn SO much and you are with someone who's in a completely different place in life. You cannot experience "new" things with him because he's already done them. Wouldn't you want a young, vibrant, youthful, fun relationship while you can still have one?|`|3UlGItEEaa	The only issue with age after you pass the legal age is how you can relate to someone outside your age group. People within 10 years of each other experience similar situations, but you and your partner grew up at different times and I can guarantee that he is more experienced at life than you are.     Your family doesn't want this for you, because older men after younger women mostly do that for perverted reasons.  Younger ladies are easier to manipulate. I am sorry to say, but its true.  I will bet that 70 or 80 of the 100 women were all around age 18. Think about that please.     I have a guy friend that is 28 (I am 20), and when I talk to him, he goes "oh, I keep forgetting you young kids do things differently".      Your family and friends probably see this and just want what is best for you.|`|NRldAzrpaa	I think you should listen to what your family and friends say, they cant all be wrong can they?  And make sure that you are actually in love with this guy b4 u do anything stupid. Just think what your relationship will be like in 20/30 years time...|`|IMjLBzlPaa	well its wrong, but in some case alright.    in your case its wrong the fool is like twice your age and make sure you get a hiv check on this fool...he might have a disease!!!!|`|8T15IBoZaa	Well considering he is 37 years old,he has probably been around the bloc...ahem.In my opinion,that is gross.No offense,but you are 19 YEARS APART! Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's right..and if you get married,you will be taking care of an old man.My friend has a mom who's like 40 and her dad is like in his 60's.And you have been dating him since you were 17 right? that IS illegal b/c you were a minor.But now it isn't.    good luck with that...
06ed26926b6bf1fee58d99eae8eaf28faa	It is just like when a girl rejects a guy and he acts like it is nothing. She gets pissed. Both girl and boys have that same thing that you now describe as ego.   The guy rejected you, right? So what does he expect. Keep on keeping on. Great going girl!  What if you meet? You meet everybody everyday. Hi, if necessary and then IGNORE...|`|LykjWv6faa	4. Girl should leave boy alone.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	1.) yes his ego is brused, he was probably used to and loved the attention from the girl.  2.) Girlshould Act casual, talk to him but don't turn it into a big deal, act like she's talking to a class mate or a casual friend.  3.) Don't mention feelings unless boy brings it up, if girl brings it up first boy will get the idea that girl still likes him, girl does not want that (even if its true)|`|M3CsxF2jaa	heck yes|`|GEyJMsaKaa	1.No,the boy is probably mad because he likes the girl too and wanted her to keep chasing him    2.Girl should shrug it off and if they happen to cross paths,just say hello and walk away.    3.Yes,she should tell him to set the record straight.|`|led0siQJaa	1- Yes. It sounds as though he wanted to play with you, but be able to brag to his friends that you are groveling at his feet. By pretending that it was no big deal to you, you made him feel like he was the one being played (good move).    2- You need to act just as you were before he rejected you. By doing that, he thinks that you honestly have moved on (and guys hate that because they are posessive) and the tables may turn causing him to start trying to get your attention and win your attention back.    3- I think that you do need to tell the boy that you are not mad at him because that makes you look strong. He will start considering that he did something wrong and trying to win you back. Sometimes its not the words that you say, it is the lack of words and the emotions that you display that convey a deeper message.
597a6f7f30469758200a6561ac8cdc6faa	well, it depends a lot on what you lead you to break up with her in the past. that's the main thing that can make thing awkward between you two, not a bouquet of flowers. If you guys text and are capable of spending so much time on the phone without snapping at each other, if she wholeheartedly laughs at your jokes and teases, then she might still have some feelings for you, otherwise she simply wouldn't bother.  I strongly suggest you first make sure you want to be with her again. think through the things that made you break up with her in the first place, so that history won't repeat itself (at least not too soon). if you stand by your statement of wanting to try again, then hell, yeah! give her some flowers and tell her how you feel. odds are she feels the same for you. just be honest with her, tell her you're sorry you guys broke up and make her feel secure, since her main fear right now could very well be things going wrong again.|`|1e4385b333fdc39a5947962d4e029837aa	I think sending flowers is a great idea. It would show her you still care for her..|`|hdYgdu0oaa	flowers are WAY too much at this point.  You will scare her away.  Maybe a nice online card....something very simple...showing friends.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Women all think differently. She may get scared off, but she may not. From what you tell us, it seems like she may take them as a kind gesture - so I say go for it.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Any girl loves to get flowers, being the ones in the vase not in the box then they can show them off. I think she'd love it wether she was in to you or not lol.|`|CN4QDGbwaa	i think flowers would be a nice thing to do and it would get the point to her that you wouldnt mind dating again.. and she might be waiting for you to say you still like her before she says it.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Send flowers, but say something with them ... don't send a dozen red roses, because that means you are 'madly in love' with her.  Go to a good florist who knows flowers and their colors, and choose the color that says "I was wrong" or "I was bad" and put one of those on your 'list' then send two that say "I'm truly sorry" ... and also send a small card, with the 'explanation' written out, and at the end put a question mark ... asking her 'which rose would you like next?'  With some baby's breath or other nice small flower, and possibly some nice daisies (yellow would be best, for 'sunshine' ... her, in your eyes) and your 'small bouquet' will say much more than something 'over the top ...|`|YlLdIPRvaa	You are thinking about this way too much.  Flowers are always nice, no matter what.|`|ijeninncaa	I think she'd really appreciate the flowers. She talking to you again for a reason, maybe she feels the same way again. Good luck x|`|JBLcMQ9haa	I think sending her flowers would be very sweet. Flowers are always a way to make a girl smile!|`|U9vE47hdaa	nope. not weird. to me that would seem like an act of kindness and appreciation. i'd thank you and probably cook dinner for you. but that's just me. don't know what she'd do...|`|O4ty1tjjaa	It can't hurt.  it will let her know you are thinking about her, and that's always nice, even if she does just want to be friends.  give it a try|`|PFBKuVhBaa	i think flowers are sweet and safe  whether friends or couples.  and no it wouldnt be weird...a strippergram would be weird xD  maybe since the break up shes wanted to just stay friends but you never know.  take it slow and hope it works out  :)|`|37PpYx8oaa	Generally speaking, there's a reason the two of you broke up in the first place, and most likely those reasons are still there.    However, that's not always the case.  If you feel that there is real potential with her, then go for it.    Flowers are awesome!!!  I love getting flowers!  Just don't hide your intentions.  Be honest and up front with her that these aren't "friendly" valentine flowers, but that they are "Will you be my Valentine" type of valentine flowers.  Big Difference.    If she says no to being your valentine, then you need to respect her wishes.  And find some other girl you can spoil with flowers!  But I think she might say yes.    Good Luck!|`|nBMVi9t8aa	Well you need a girls help you got 1.Ok yes give her flowers say be my valentine.If you do want to date her again then talk to her say I want you back dance with her and when you have a chance kiss her for a long time.Thats all a girl would want.O! and on valentines day take her 2 a romantic dinner. If you want u can add me on yahoo messenger nicole.mathews81.|`|ibWdXxmbaa	dont send flowers u thico hav sex hahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|39pl2Dotaa	i dont think it would be weird if you sent them as friends|`|fX8Ydc0naa	Send them.|`|uJOl3K0yaa	awww. no I dont think it would be weird to send her flowers. If you like her still, valentines day is the perfect time to tell her how you feel. She'll think it's the sweetest thing :)|`|RLaTxDfJaa	flowers are nice, but u should go to her ON v-day ( it will b romantic) and profess your feelings. if she doesn't want ya back then u wont be waisting ur time.|`|C6S20vqkaa	send the flowers. you can still claim its an innocent Vday present, friendship if nothing else! it would make me sweet on you if i was in her shoes. you've got to give it to the guy who gives it the G.O. any effort is appreciated considering some guys don't make any!|`|Ir6TLlGfaa	I think flowers would be nice.  if you go to her place and see her reaction, study her facial expressions and figure out if you are going to say it was a friend thing or a get back together thing.  or if you call her, listen to her voice, if its hesitant or if its very cheerful.  or if you aren't sure, then just say it was a friend thing and work from there to a better relationship.  she needs to feel like she can trust you.  Good Luck!|`|UZsSWMupaa	Flowers are something a girl loves getting for valentines day i mean she would probably love you more for getting her flowers. Stick with the flowers and don't change your mind|`|ItnXMor3aa	i would find it wierd.  i had a boyfriend & when i broke up with him, we were pretty distance.  we started texting about a month after, i can tell he wants to get back together but i just try to ignore it, but if he ever sent me flowers... i think itd be a little aqward but you could always try. i dont know its diffrent with every realtion ship, but i think you should just send her a card saying happy valentines day buddy! or one of those friends one kay?  it can maybe get you a bit closer but dont take two steps at once and move to fast.
lAQG15kdaa	hey, im 21 and ''trying'' to  get over my boyfriend of six years, he broke up with me last Thursday because we got into a fight. Ive been spending my nights crying, and thinking about him all the time. I called him last night, and we talked, but he said hes still unsure if he wants to be with me.    The biggest problem im having is,  why do i want to get back with him when he clearly is unsure? Hes unsure, and IM NOT at all. And i think the same as you, if he cared as much as he did say, wouldn't he want to be with me. I'm just pulling along right now, and hoping for the best, don't give up your happiness for a guy, go out with your friends, keep busy, thats my best advice.  just wanted to let you know that you aren't alone.    Time heals all wounds. Best of luck to you& to me lol    p.s dont blame yourself, you both contributed to doing things with other people not just one don't feel guilty. Not like he was being a prince charming while you were hooking up with another guy   .|`|nKKi1hANaa	the best thing here is to move on. this dude is a jerk. im not say in you should have slept with that other dude. sex is a very important thing not something you just do because you are upset over some loser.
JV3op5Zwaa	yeah this is definitely not the case with me, in fact i was thinking just the other day that there were very few truly attractive females|`|QDAzw9zSaa	Guys do not find all girls attractive, but everyone is different, i might find a girl attractive and someone else might be like dude are you crazy she is the ugliest girl on earth.    We all have our own opinion, and we are very different In our own ways.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Hell no.|`|CnlSbPsuaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|0L3tqpEVaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I think how a person acts makes them attractive or not.|`|W6ojHHNGaa	of course not. not all girls are attractive but you have to consider that not  every men likes the same type of women. For example, there is a girl in my neighborhood that all of my friends are dying to date and she is pretty and all those stuff but i don't even like her so you have to think that it depends with what guy are you talking to. hope this helped you|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	i don't find all girls hot by any means.  i do break down everything when checking out a girl but not as bad as you.  i really don't have a look i go for but i am little picky.  besides all that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"  who cares what other people find attractive?  i understand what you are saying but don't dwell on it.  we have all dated someone or talked to someone that our friends thought were ugly (that could be alcohol inspired...LOL)|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	Each of us view things differently. You think that girl is not attractive at all, but he does. He is looking at something different or he likes what that girl have. Another guy could found her normal, or could have the same opinion as you.   It is a matter of taste.     I will give you an example, my friend was that guy who liked attractive and hot girls. Jo lo look alike was what he looking for in a girl. Finally, he fell in love with a girl ( i personally think she is average) but he thinks she is hot.     You can't  predict men.|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	I think a lot of my friends are attracted to anything with legs|`|3MurocTSaa	pretty much the underlying rule to dudes is no fat chicks. thats it.
fRIEHBJOaa	you married someone you didnt know, it seems, but i dont think you need to suffer with this for the rest of your life.     if he lied then, only God knows what he's lying about now.    i couldnt stay married to a liar and pervert. that's just me.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	http://www.growleaders.org/PDF/%20Keys%2...    if this link works..i suggest checking it out...you can only change your actions not your husbands...give it a try it made a world of difference in my marriage    God Bless|`|a70231ccec5d44c2d21f177c98496f1baa	first off, sorry to say it but, you should not have married him when you round out he lied to you about the fiance he had.     what kind of man doesn't listen to his wife if she is saying that something u are doing to is affecting you.    I have a problem with a husband who is looking at porn and does not see it as a problem. if it affects you. i see nothing wrong with looking at it together only or a little while to get some ideas, to spice up the sex life. but....    I see nothing wrong with him giving other females a ride home, but if he is using that to get women, then its a problem.    the point is you are already married. the ball is in your court??? If you can't see yourself living with him for the rest of your life, then you will have to get a divorce. But if you think it can work then, see what happens.    Take it easy and try not to stress.
IMjLBzlPaa	you should talk to your bro about his friend...tell him how u feel. jus make sure not to tell him that you guys been together for months.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Why are you doing something you shouldn't?    I think you are too young to be going steady with a boy as nether of you are mature enough to keep out of trouble|`|UhAHaOWFaa	Yes end it!    You don't go out with your friend's sister! big no no!|`|HUhheZWtaa	YOUR a bit TOOOOOO Young  n i think u should tell your brotherfor your own saftey|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Yes, you should end it. Not only for your brother but because you are 12.|`|9ZRvPegvaa	Well whatever you do, be very careful. You are still a little child.  I dont see the harm in having a close friendship with your brothers friend.  If you think it will lead to something more serious and you think it will affect your relationship with your brother.  You have to figure out what is more important to you. So you have a choice you brother or your boyfriend, if it is the boyfriend is he worth it?      Whatever you do, make sure the boy does not take advantage of you, talk to someone.  I have a daughter who is 12, and I will not accept her having a boyfriend at this age.  Children are growing up too fast as it is.|`|3fJCL3mXaa	grow up . your not ready .|`|VMY7No0eaa	YOU are WAY TOO YOUNG to be involved with a guy.  END it ... and then if it returns later that would be good.  (hopefully it is NOT sexual... at this point)   Stay away from him... and your Bro. SHOULD kill him if he is messing with you!|`|u9uFdSrqaa	talk  to your bother about how you feel for this person
csSysMMVaa	yes|`|pwejv6jpaa	if you pay for sex your a loser.|`|TOIOyJ10aa	first of all: i dont think its good to go to a hooker. note this: a lot of girls DONT want to be there. they are being held there against there will sleeping disgusting old men who are totally drunk. i dont encourage it.  though, you can easily go have sex in amsterdam. go to the singel or red light district and choose one. yeah its that simple. just walk along and the girls are standing in front of the window showing what they have to offer. but please!! look out for those young girls, they really DONT want you, there are a lot of older woman who do like their job, choose them!  and for the record, if you dont want to pay for it, go to the Escape club at the Rembrandplein. its high likely that you will find a girl who wants to get laid. dutch girls are really weird and easy to get i quess.  not all of them ofcourse, i'm just saying that there are a lot of skanks who are for free and are totally wasted. go to the rembrandtplein, see for yourself.  AMSTERDAM ROCKS!! i am 1000 % sure you will love it and wonder why your city isnt more like it. i feel goddamn blessed everyday to live in amsterdam. its in a free country! you can have sex with a woman at any time of the day, you can smoke pod (coffeeshops open from 7 till 1, weekends 3) and you can negotiate with police!!  I love it, and i will never ever leave it.  sorry for misspellings.|`|LwatAlVDaa	You can find a prostitute;  Amsterdam=lots of legal weed= higher than a kite
zrYMOaQRaa	Hey there. Its obvious your still quite young and I think thats just way too much information. Although I understand your hurting and confused.  It sounds a little like she's playing with you. You need to stand up for yourself and not allow someone to bounce you around like a toy. I know it is hard to let go of someone that you have such strong feelings for, but she isn't treating you right. The right woman for you wouldn't treat you so bad. It may be hard to believe that you could ever feel so strongly for someone else, but trust me you will. Cut your ties with this girl. Don't look back, move on and you will be better off. You never know, maybe this girl will realize the mistake she made with you and start respecting you. At that point you might be able to have a real relationship with her. Until then, you should concentrate on your number one first. Thats you.|`|YuF9Jp4gaa	too long! as u said you are her back up , . . Yes you are man. . . Get a life . . . .be a man n be a lion! crying for a girl who using you?  if i tell you what, your ego n respect is better for you than ths girl.|`|b7Ib3ZWQaa	im sorry, dude. This girl seems like she has to get what she wants, or she'll make every one pay for it. she's having you pick between her and other girls you want to be with. That should instantly tell you that a friend does not do that to another friend. I personally think that you should not see her again, because she's only going to make you feel worse. I know, easier said than done, but you should try your best. And especially when your in college, you have no time for drama. The only way I would ever want to be with someone like her again, is if that she proves to you that she's changed and that she's broken up with her other boyfriend, and that she treats every one else better. When I say proves, I acually mean proves, not just say that she's changed, she acually is. Do what you think you should do though, not me.|`|uVH046Fjaa	Sounds like you have a problem on your hands mister.|`|AA10832878	Simple, just change your number and don't call "her." We make things complicated that really aren't complicated in our lives, and end up not living as long as we were "supposed" to. Stress complicates our health, no matter what our age group. Change your number, and don't call her. If she approaches "you" in person, tell her it's over and walk away, it's THAT simple. Good luck. If I can do it, "anyone" can !|`|UyNa0XEKaa	She is just playing games. You said she cheated on her man with you. If she was to leave her boyfriend, do you really feel you could trust her in a relationship? You deserve better. She don't care about your feelings.|`|6dB5yZbsaa	Let it go, you said she went back to her old boyfriend and then all this happened.  Just let it go and find someone else that you can communicate with better.  God Bless  :)|`|NTwWUj09aa	let her go, it sounds like you really like her but could you really trust her, i mean shes been with her boyfriend that long and shes cheated on him with you, it really sounds like shes playing you both and your right you really are her back up, im really sorry to tell you this but serious move on theres plenty more fish in the sea! good luck|`|Xxkfh2QCaa	WOW....basically you are the bit on the side and she wants the best of both worlds having her boyfriend and stringing you along at the same time. Thats evil! She knows what she is doing and she obviously doesnt want to end it with her boyfriend so that immediately should tell you to end it with her. If she hasnt left her boyfriend for you by now then she never will. She could genuinely care about you but she is choosing her boyfriend. That is something that you need to understand!!     She has double standards for you coz she wont speak to you if you see other people...but she has a boyfriend??? Cant believe that you actually put up with it.    My advice is to cut all contact with her...change your phone number if you have to. From personal exeperience, it is the only thing that will work. It will be very difficult but you need to focus on other things in your life, your college work and your friends and just forget her completely. It is easier said than done but i guarantee that it will help.     If she is genuine then she will see what she is missing and leave him, but then do you really want to be with someone who can treat her boyfriend that way...if you were boyfriend and girlfriend then she could easily do the same to you!! You deserve better and dont let her convince you otherwise!    hope this helps...good luck!

6XqY0istaa	The best choice is always to be both honest and respectful.  You sound like a guy who has a pretty good idea of what that is, but it seems you would like a more specific answer.  Let's say that you just really aren't interested in her.  If she asks you during the date what you think, you can tell her that you think she's very nice but that you don't see it going farther than friendship.      If you don't talk about this during the date, DEFINITELY contact her within the next few days and tell her honestly that it's not going to work out, but thank her for the fun evening (any positive feedback she receives will help to salve her pride and self-esteem).  If you have been talking to this girl for awhile, I think it would be rude to just disappear.  Rejection hurts, but rejection AND disrespect hurt even more.  It sounds like you've experienced that before, so you know what I mean.  Also, don't do anything to give her another impression during the date, like kissing her or saying "we should do this again!"    On the other hand, you may absolutely lover her, right?  Good luck!|`|I2fhPiFyaa	Wow if only all guys where like you.   Ehm well hope it all goes well.   But if it doesn't here are some ideas.     1) Nice meeting you but i don't think there's any chemistry. Would you like to try and be friends ?.   2) Nice to meet you, but i dont think we are compatible.    Tbh i know it sounds very cliched but maybe just be honest with her, and just offer to be friends.   If you REALLY don't want to see her again then just tell her. Honestly is always the best policy (:     Goodluck (Y).|`|AA11796667	honesty is the best in cases like this, Hey I loved our evening or date out but I feel it wasn't enough there not enough chemistry .. what ever you can say in a nice way just don't start with is me not you usual bomb we all know that is bull crap LOL be honest in a nice way is the right thing to do. Good luck.|`|pwejv6jpaa	tell her your not interested romantically.|`|Rb087BsAaa	Just say you had a nice time, etc, but DON'T mention a future communication.  The problem solves itself.|`|AA12392755	Sounds like you are setting yourself up for failure before even meeting her, sort of a self-fullfilling prophecy.  If it goes as you say, just be honest and tell her it was nice meeting her but you don't think it will work for the both of you.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	2 way street! she maybe the sme and nether of you will know unless yo go out? at the very worst you coud turn out to be friends. even if youre like pen pals....|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	any ways u have to tell her,  so do it without delay,  if u delay,,she might get more hurt.  just tell her what u felt,  it 'll not be fyne if u both decide to be togethr.thr shud be a so called chemistry between the two,  and u found it lackin in this relationship,so its better we break up,,,  u should be neither too caring nor too arrogant while doing this,be calm and serious,and make her feel that what u r gonna say s something worth conciderin.  hop my suggestions help u,  all the best,  she 'll surely understand ur point and stay cool,  coz gals r very ruf &tuf these days,,  so dont worry|`|u49dfBkDaa	Be honest about the chemistry not being there. That is an unharsh way of breaking something off because it just means that you aren't compatible for each other but doesn't imply that there's something wrong with her. It's good that you aren't just going to ignore her because that is harsh.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Be honest.  The same thing happened to me in reverse.  She sent me a nice email saying she enjoyed herself but didn't feel any chemistry.  I took it very well as I'm sure she will. I really felt bad b/c I always just kind of go missing until they get the idea. Now Thats NOT the way to do it.  Do as I say and not as I do.|`|JIkOWMo8aa	Dont just not call her that kills us.  I think just be like look it was really nice meeting you but I dont feel a connection like I thought I would and Im really searching for that. Thanks so much for meeting up, its been great getting to know you but I think we are best as friends.|`|HKB2lZjjaa	Tell her shes fat|`|8T15IBoZaa	Well if there is no chemistry,she will most likely feel it too.You might not have to say anything,she might say it first.But lets hope it works. =] Think positive.|`|DlaEYOC5aa	Cut the date short and Tell her you have had a nice time but there is no chemistry between you.  she would be grateful and thank you for your honesty.  better  than you leading her on.|`|fb4a60ee36cbde158114ea44d8759a32aa	honestly , don't be the typical guy who doesn't call back , please it hurts
LwatAlVDaa	I'm thinking about my parents, there stressed out over work and everything makes them mad at each other. There thinking about getting a divorce and i keep thinking its my fault becuase i always bother them with issues.    I'm also thinking about taking my relationship with my boyfriend to the next level.    I'm stressing over my grades this semester, i ended up with 2 C's and my dad is gonna freak out.    I'm thinking about how to lose weight, even though people don't tell me i need to i think im a fat A**.    I'm thinking about how my life is going to turn out in the future becuase by the time im starting MY life on my own the economy is going to be mega Sh*t.    I'm thinking about what i want to do with my life and how I'm going to pay for college.    I'm thinking about why my parents moved me away from my life in a big town and moved me to a small town that should be named hell.    I'm thinking about why the hell my life is a big bag of crap! I hate my life and i don't know why everything is shi.tty!|`|LykjWv6faa	Going to watch the Steve Wilkos show...then get ready for my Shakespeare class.

Sin embargo, cuando entienden que ya sea su madre o su padre, sern ms felices con otras personas, ya lo llevan mejor...    No te obsesiones con su edad, porque normalmente cuando mayores sean, peor lo pasarn. As que hblalo con ellos, y hazles ver que ellos no saldrn perjudicados si hay alguien ms. Sobretodo, cuando tengas pareja, demustrales que siguen siendo los ms importantes, muchas veces slo se trata de celos, y siendo atento con ellos, les afecta menos.

Like, when a guy has a huge penis and wants to act like a porn star, it sucks that they don't realize those women are only pretending to not want to curl up in a ball in pain (or have grown accustomed to it with numbing agents, etc) ..|`|cd2ff6d9798215d0536899c2ea1dd9d5aa	If he walks on the beach and leaves three tracks in the sand.|`|gzERnclQaa	"Too big" is what ever becomes unpleasurable or painful for you.

iOa7rriGaa	Well everyone gets jealous once in awhile but usually it's if a guy they like or are with is flirting with another girl especially a friend. If she catches her boyfriend looking at another girl for too long can also do it. If it makes them crazy and do wired things than that means they are too jealous and really care about the guy and it could end badly or even become dangerous. How it feels is not good it makes you feel unimportant and upset. Most people would want to either end it or they would do whatever to make sure that the situation never happens again.|`|7NkYCUKdaa	Personally, Im not a jealous person.    But when I am, I don't show it.  I hate being jealous, it makes me feel clingy.  So I avoid it.  Most people show it cause they can't stand what is going on.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	if a girl doesnt get jealous then there must be something wrong with her. honsetly.  i get jealous when the guy that im commited to is hangingout with a diffrent girl and when he doesnt text me for long periods of time.  i kinda get crazy. ill text him until he texts me back and i get mad sometimes too.

Talk a little bit about what you know of wrestling, mention the socks. Look through his profile to see if he has similar interest in music and movies.

Stare col piede in 2 scarpe siginfica prendere in giro 3 persone contemporaneamente: le/gli altri due e te stesso.  Amare tutti  amare nessuno veramente, se non amore di s e quindi narcisismo/edonismo vero e proprio.  L'intelligenza  lasciare un fidanzato/a quando ti accorgi che non lo ami pi.  Per vivere serenamente, per darsi serenamente.    Il numero 3 ricorda  un numero dispari, e prima o poi il meccanismo salta...e si finisce col "sedere" per terra, e con un pugno di mosche in mano...

Come nella chimica ci sono degli elementi indispensabili per fare delle combinazioni, cos nella vita l'amore  uno di quegli elementi.

Ciao.|`|M3sR5YdZaa	Bueno lunita, creo que es totalmente normal que te sientas as, creo que todos tenemos necesidades y esa es una de ella, el tener una pareja que te ame y te haga sentir especia, as es totalmente comprensible. Si quieres tener novio no lo vas a encontrar si comienzas a buscarlo, porque no s si te has dado cuenta pero eso no funciona, los hombres y mujeres podemos sentir cuando alguien est desesperado y eso mismo hace que alejemos a las personas de nosotros, no s por qu, no me preguntes porqu ocurre eso jajaja pero es la realidad, cruel pero verdad. Pienso que una no tiene novio porque se siente sola, sino porque la persona adecuada llega, yo estuve bastante tiempo sola porque no encontraba al hombre adecuado, ahora que ya lo encontr me siento feliz porque l es todo lo que siempre quise, as que si tienes paciencia llegar el adecuado, ahora bien si quieres tener un novio slo para no sentirte sola y lo encuentras pues dale, pero ten en cuenta que eso al final de cuentas no termina bien.

Fijate la primera vez que me case, tenia solo 20 a?os y recuerdo como hablavamos con mi ex de cuando furamos muy viejitos y que si los nietos y que si los hijos, y esto y el otro, el matrimonio duro como 5 a?os y tuvimos un hijo.

Judging on your past few experiences with your ex, she will probably leave you again. It's best not to go through that hurt over and over or you might not be able to trust other people because you've been dumped over and over.    You see these situations alot in dramas and usually the protagonist forgives the cheater only to have the ex cheat on them over again.    If you really like her, I think you should still give around a month of just being friends and see if she's still interested in you. Maybe its just a little fling and she will lose interest in you fast.     Best of luck!|`|c96d809951ae4f99effc004865caeff8aa	okay, it isn't love for her just yet obviously.    keep in mind that she might not have the same experience with love or relationships as you.    My opinon,  she didn't cheat and she apologized..so move on.    Trust isn't a "should I or shouldn't I?"  It's simply if you feel you can or not.    and trust could be built and rebuilt.  it's up to you to decide if she's worth it.    take a chance if you think she is.    first mistake is mostly always forgivable ..  if she does this agian...then youll know better

EV1u9cquaa	Si es menor de edad, ?no crees que ese es un problema? (a menos que slo haya uno par de a?os en las edades de los dos).    Si tu novia pas una experiencia traumtica de ni?a con su cu?ado, creo que aqu hay un problema ms grave que los celos.    El problema no pienso que sean los celos. Celos es temer perder el cari?o del otro. Los celos son ante todo una inseguridad. ?Crees que la familia de ella le est robando el afecto que siente por ti?    Opino que ella no debe poner de su parte para confiar en la relacin. Acaso debers analizar el compromiso que llevas. De lo contrario, la semilla de los celos es ms fuerte que la voluntad de mantener una relacin estable.|`|iu5c19ZUaa	Estoy un poco de acuerdo con la primera respuesta, pero en realidad que le podrias pedir a tu novia para que demuestre que te es fiel? Realmente creo que no hay mucho que pedir. En fin las peores estupideceses se an echo por amor. si quieres seguir obsesionandote y mal viajandote es tu problema, pero recuerda que no solo te puedes hacer da?o a ti mismo|`|3Ze3JxnHaa	Los celos son manejables porque no se trata de la otra persona sino de ti! Debes ser un poco ms seguro de ti mismo.  No pienses bajo ningn punto de vista que te enga?a, confa y piensa que eres lo ms importante para ella, no es su culpa que no pueda salir. Podras asfixiarla con tus celos y eso es ms peligroso que tu desconfianza porque podras cansarla y tu falta de autoestima no es buena consejera, la pareja tiende a sentirse demasiado perseguida, acosada y no dejas lugar a que te admire por tu firmesa, debes ser su protector y no su carcelero. Cuando entiendas eso ella va a extra?arte y quererte ms que nunca. La clave est en no perseguirla y darle su tiempo, haste un poco "el interesante" para atraerla an ms. Eso siempre funciona...Soy mujer y te lo aseguro! Besos y suerte!|`|92039088ef2712e13f826bb1e871792aaa	amigo ya estas en edad de algo mas serio no busques problemas cn una chiquilla q pues quizas no te dara lo q necesitas deja eso por la paz y pues los celos no son buenos asi q dejala y se feliz cn alguien mas suerte|`|ZAwtedW3aa	sera guapa encantadora...!    pero no hay mas chicas en el mundo?    no se pero si su familia no te quiere ni ver!    vamos te lo esta dejando bien claro!    pasa pagina!    y encuentra otra mejor    ella no te combiene    un beso suerteeeeee"!|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Olvidate de esa chiquita, si desde ahora te esta llenando la vida de conflictos...imaginate como sera el resto de tu vida....esta listo para llevar una vida conflictiva, llena de problemas y de traumas??????

En fait avant de me jeter  l'eau je me suis dit   - si elle diit non, au pire elle me dirait non et puis moi je m'en irait tranquillement faire ma vie ailleurs  - si j'ai l'air ringard, au pire ?a la fera rigoler et elle aura qqch de marrant  raconter  ses copines  - de toute fa?on on ne peut pas plaire  tout le monde, que si j'avais conduit, ?a ne remettai pas en cause ma manire d'tre mais juste que je ne correspondais pas  ce qu'elle recherchait, ou tout simplement qu'elle tait en couple    Si jamais ?a ne marchait pas avec elle, je referai sans hsiter|`|gBxrcVDwaa	En tout cas ca me ferait plaisir ...

These type of men usually doesn't know the art of cherishing. They only like to dwell on the past, dwell on what they can't have.     Usually, with time, they learn and grow, but for some, it takes a long, long time. Then, when the right time comes, they choose to settle, sometimes with women who are not as good or pretty as the ones they let go in the past.    Men turn into players because they have problems establishing close bonds. This is partly due to past traumas, hurt and bad experiences. They had a dream that was broken.    Sometimes, these dreams were unrealistic in the first place, but they couldn't see it. They keep on trying until they tire out.    By having multiple partners, they don't have to build an attachment too strongly on anyone of them. That way, they remain in "control" of their feelings.    These men are usually very charismatic and good with the ladies. Their intentions are only for themselves and only themselves.    Try if you can, to see that these people can't be changed. They can only be inspired.    The more you try to tie them down, the more they run.     If you have no patience and want to fulfill your own needs, I say, put yourself first. If you don't, they wouldn't.    Just remember, these type of men aren't going to be your knight in shiny armour, whom you have been dreaming for.     It's alot of work to love them. You will need extraordinary patience, generosity and loving kindness to put up with it all.    Put it this way, they would rather regret losing a good woman than giving up control again.    If you love them, then set them free.     Some are just meant to be travellers while others, settlers.

Oublie cette raison que tu te donnes et recommence  zro. C'est fini, cet autre mec.    Pour le prsent, sois honnte avec ton copain actuel. Dis-lui exactement comment tu te ressens par rapport  tout cela. Tu sais, les filles comme toi ne sont pas si rares, mais la plupart n'osent pas le dire, de peur de se faire rejeter ou de ne pas para?tre ? cool ?. Ou alors, elle ne veulent rien savoir du tout, alors que toi, tu veux vraiment dvelopper ce go?t, ce qui est dj beaucoup pour ton copain. Va voir les sondages sur la libido des hommes et des femmes, et tu verras que tu n'es pas si exceptionnelle.     Et puis, oublie aussi les ? crack crack pendant toute la nuit ?. C'est des fantasmes que trs peu de personnes vivent dans la vraie vie. Commence par viser de petites expriences intimes avec ton copain. Prends le temps de dcouvrir ce que tu aimes, et ne te laisse jamais imposer des images de l'extrieur.     Tu pourrais aussi essayer la masturbation. C'est un bon moyen d'apprendre  avoir du plaisir sans tre en prsence de quelqu'un qui a des attentes.    Finalement, tu pourrais toujours te procurer un livre sur les diffrentes positions et l'art de faire l'amour et explorer cela avec lui, mais mme ?a, ce n'est pas l'essentiel. L'essentiel, c'est que tu dcouvres ce que tu aimes avec ton copain,  partir de toi.    Ne te laisse pas imposer des images de l'extrieur. Vas-y  ta fa?on, en acceptant que tu as un petit apptit et que certaines choses te dgo?tent. Commence par les choses que tu aimes, les caresses simples, mme si ce n'est pas  proprement parler sexuel. Tout finit par devenir sexuel si on est dans la sensualit.

Ressentir, c'est sentir tes vtements que tu portes actuellement... les petites touches de ces derniers sur ton dos quand tu bouges, etc... Mais aussi, les odeurs que tu dgages quand tu bouges...  Bref, utilise le plus possible tes sens pour tout ce qui te concerne...  Ensuite, coute, sens, regarde les mondes extrieurs de ton corps... Cela peut tre les bruits dans une pice calme... bref, dveloppe le plus possible tes sens...   Cela va t'amener  t'intresser  ton homme... Ou celui pour qui ton coeur bat  la chamade en sa prsence... Intresse toi  ton corps,  ces odeurs,  ces bruits quand il marche, etc...  Intresse toi  la forme de son visage, etc... Tout de lui t'est connu...  Enfin, comme tu n'auras pas tout connu de lui et de toi, laisse ensuite ta recherche de dveloppement de tes sens te guider sur la recherche du plaisir qu'il te donnera et que tu lui donneras, guider par ces gestes.... Et ainsi, mutuellement, vos gestes guideront le corps de l'autre, vers des plaisirs d'abord phmres, mais avec le temps, vous apprendrez  les prolonger... ;-)  Bon plaisir et envies !! ;-)|`|i3m3ClLjaa	Prends une craquotte et arrete de te prendre la tete.

ghLyjyYkaa	Pour moi c'est indispensable, le sexe joue un role trs important dans une relation amoureuse. Si il n'y en a pas c'est que quelquechose cloche et que cette relation ne pourra pas durer. c'est mon avis perso aprs si il y a des adeptes des relations platoniques c'est leur choix (mais c'est peut-tre qu'ils n'aiment pas le sexe tout simplement)|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Si tu aime sans faire l'amour c'est biensur toujours une relation amoureuse mais  la longue vous allez mourir d'ennuie...    L'amour sans faire l'amour c'est un concept qui m'a toujours surpris moi..    Le sexe n'est pas sale enfin, il faut arrter le dlire d'amour sans sexe ?a n'amne que des frustrations et  force les frustrations sexuelle ?a engendre normment de dviances... (cf les prtres...).    P.S: je considre la question pour des personnes majeures videmment...|`|3GRc4IEVaa	?a dpend de la relation |`|vLK5KOsCaa	pas toujours, parfois le coeur suffit, mais c'est assez rare.|`|jdQl5ZDXaa	non, pas obigatoire.. mais si vous vous aimez vous en aurez envie...|`|SOzqHbCtaa	pas obligatoirement mais il jou aussi un role dans la relation|`|UmjpJ6Ugaa	Nietzsche disait "La Philosophie c'est l'histoire d'un corps"... Ton corps c'est toi, et ton esprit est une partie de ton corps...N'changer qu'intellectuellement avec quelqu'un c'est limiter la qualit de la relation avec l'autre, cela revient  brasser du vent... Personne ne peut faire l'conomie de son corps ni, surtout s'il est amoureux, faire abstraction du corps de l'autre. Ne pas toucher l'autre c'est comme nier son existence, c'est inhumain tout simplement inhumain... L'tre humain est esprit et corps troitement imbriqu, insparable...|`|WXiimKcRaa	Tout dpend de la relation que tu as avec elle et savoir depuis combien de temps tu es avec, savoir pourquoi l'un des deux ne voudraient pas avec de relations sexuelles galement.    J'pense qu'avant de s'engager pour de bon avec quelqu'un il faut avoir eu des relations sexuelles avec et mme avoir vcu avec.    Aprs comme l'a dis une des personnes ?a dpend de vos ages,  10 ans ou 70 ans c'est pas pareil qu' 30 ans|`|wMV5lginaa	Oui et non. Ca dpend de comment tu es avec la personne et si tu en as envie.  Car on peut aimer la personne avec qui on est mais n'avoir pas spcialement envie de faire l'amour (je sais que certains vont dire que je suis folle mais pourtant c'est vrai, des fois rien qu'un baiser et tre dans les bras de l'tre aim suffit).|`|AOcqViefaa	Mais non vous pensez que l'amour c'est obligatoirement le sexe????????????????  L'amour est plus suprieur de tous ces envies animales, car c'est l'ame qui le dirige et le ressent et l'ame est toujours plus suprieur que le corps. Dans une relation il faut d'abord ressenir les palpitations du coeur, et la pense qui est toujours pour l'tre aim enssuite l'ame demande l'union avec l'ame du bien aim une union sacre et supriure de touton dernier stade et aprscette union sacre vient ensuite les relations physiques.|`|9e4626b5fee87010e6bb472909722c90aa	C'est le mot obligatoirement qui gne, parce que c'est  vous de dcidez des rgles de votre relation, on s'en fout de ce que les autres font... l'essentiel c'est que tout le monde soit satisfait...mais la plus part du temps c'est le mec qui insiste pour qu'il y ait du sexe, si lui veut bien s'en passer...quand c'est le contraire, c'est pas le mec qui va se plaindre!!|`|i0Jam0Muaa	Il y en a ncessairement assez vite, sauf si tu veux te rserver jusqu'au mariage (et l encore il y en a donc dans la relation par la suite, sachant aussi que pendant cette priode d'attente le couple s'acquitte de pliminaires).    Donc oui, une relation avec une autre personne sans relation sexuelle, sans attirance, sans dsir physique, ?a s'appelle de l'amiti (bon y a aussi le cas de la famille, mais dans notre cas, c'est surtout l'amiti...).    Donc il y aura du sexe, tout dpend de vos dsirs et de leur intensit pour votre 1re fois et de la frquence, mais bien s?r que c'est ncessaire, sinon ce n'est pas une relation amoureuse... ou alors c'est trs platonique, mais dans ce caas j'appelle cela soit frustration, soit amiti trs forte... |`|931dbc13ad7209ad1b6966b8cbddea49aa	Essaye du Ketchup !!|`|zhoVjizMaa	Si ca devient srieux, il risque bien de se passer ce genre  de choses.     Normalement, quand on est amoureux, on a une envie physique de son partenaire! Un besoin d'tre en symbiose de corps et d'esprit avec celle ou celui que l'on aime! Et on arrive de manire progressive  un point o l'on ne peut plus rsister...     A ce moment l, vous sentirez tous les deux un besoin fusionnel, et il se passera quelque chose!   |`|pmYtjjSUaa	Oui et non.|`|eIWg32lTaa	A 95% du temps oui|`|nUg4GldZaa	Oui,  quoi ?a sert d'avoir un jouet si tu ne peux pas jouer avec !?|`|E8AvpkHJaa	Encore un "faux-cul" qui vient poser sa question ...!!!|`|yzHD8Xw2aa	non pas obligatoirement  mais  par contre il faut  obligatoirement qu'il y ai une entente ,un sentiment positive vers cette personne :)|`|EUFXa7gEaa	si tu as 20ans oui  si tu en as 65, oui si tu en est encore capable lol!|`|2595442158d3251f3d17d868993245b5aa	je dirai oui et encore oui, merde si en plus on me retire cela! il reste quoi aprs (la mauvaise humeur et les factures)? lol    tant qu' me priver de sexe, autant rentrer dans un couvent du genre, au moins on me foutra la paix !|`|i2UgSF86aa	Oui,  et si cela marche terriblement bien, y aurait moins d'adultres.  Les tromperies sont principalement dues  une histoire de sexe, ou un manque de sexe, ou ce n'est pas  notre attente.  |`|uWxkNLt6aa	pour ma part le sexe est indispensable dans toutes relations amoureuses|`|8tEfgMB1aa	non pas forcment|`|A50FwDNzaa	Mais videment c'est ncessaire.soyons ralistes.|`|sendo5Gsaa	oui il doit y avoir du sexe sans quoi ce sera quel genre de relations exactement?? s'il n'y en a pas c'est que ca marche pas: d'ou le lien entre amour et faire l'amour!|`|30ed701068ba1fdb98768cf814bafe62aa	Oui, et non ...dans la diversit, mieux vaut attendre le bon jour, au bon lieu et avec celle que tu aimes....celle qui a une grande place dans ton coeur...    Tiens..!!! c'est comme cela , rpondit une petite voix...!!!     bient?t alors.    Diversity's|`|c9e9n0hXaa	oui, ,je ne crois pas  une fidelit sans sexe|`|VGAHXG9haa	sa depend combien de temps sa fait que tu sors avec mais en gnral le sex et le reflet de la ie du couple.|`|bNnHp5fKaa	le sexe mettrai du piquant dans une relation et permet l'epanouissement des 2 etres....|`|QeaDGqwgaa	si c'est srieux et durable oui.|`|5e4y9wOlaa	Oui, oui et oui  sauf si t'as moins de 16 ans l je comprendrais

Ce n'est pas du tout contre toi que je dis ?a, mais je me sers de ta question pour rpondre  toutes celles qui critiquent la minceur et aprs viennent demander quel rgime elles doivent suivre.

Donc il l'aime d'un amour filial.  Toi il t'aime diffremment, d'un grand amour charnel.   Tu ne dois pas tre jalouse de l'amour qu'il voue  sa mre.  Pense que toi aussi tu auras peut-tre un fils qui t'aimeras fort, mais pas de la mme fa?on qu'il aimera sa femme.  J'espre que je me suis bien fa?te comprendre.|`|PbaYvVZmaa	Un petit effort avec la ponctuation n'aurait pas t du luxe.|`|chFQb227aa	Elle est folle !  Bien s?r que l'amour d'un fils est diffrent de l'amour d'un mari !  Le mari ne pourra jamais choisir entre les 2, de mme qu'il aime sa soeur d'un amour fraternel !  Apparemment, cette fille se pose en rivale  sa belle-mre (par rapport au mnage ?  la cuisine ? n'importe quoi !!), ce qui est anormal car cette hantise l'empchera de vivre son couple normalement.  Si elle s'attend  ce qu'il choisisse quelqu'un, elle va tre d?ue !  Un mari est aussi (voire mme avant tout un fils et un frre, voire un ami).  Elle manque de confiance en elle.  Elle doit accepter l'ide de le partager avec son entourage  lui.  Je suppose qu'il ne couche pas avec sa mre ou sa soeur ou sa tante, non ?  Bah alors !!!!  On a tous plusieurs casquettes  porter, plusieurs r?les  jouer dans notre vie, dont celui de fiston, aussi aimant soit-il envers sa mre.  Elle est pas jalouse de ses enfants aussi, hein ?  J'ai toujours encourag mon mari  soutenir sa mre mme financirement (sans forcment se ruiner) et je la dfends quand il lui trouve des torts.  Et cette fille-l, n'aime-t-elle pas sa propre mre diffremment de son mari ?|`|AIyPPMmGaa	non  c sa mr dc el na pa a chialer pr sa|`|wPrWe0gZaa	Je ne suis pas s?r d'avoir compris la question, toutefois je vais hasarder  y rpondre. Votre belle mre n'est pas votre rivale, copouse. Il arrive le plus souvent que les deux se trompent d'adversaire. L'amour que l'homme prouve pour sa mre n'est pas la mme chose que celui envers son pouse. Cela ne devrait pas caus de problmes. Mais elles en font de cela l'omelette. C'est curieux pour une femme  qui jalouse sa belle mre et inversement. prparez-vous plut?t  faire face  une ventuelle ma?tresse....  Semble t-il que les deux ont de la peine  cohabiter, mieux vaut viter les confronter.|`|1e90efeeb79c6b4e8fa4f2e5ef94aad5aa	je pense que c'est vraiment stupide de poser  qqn ce genre de question.on aime sa mere ainsi que sa femme, mais de manire diffrente.
QrM6M4Geaa	Les femmes faciles est un concept impos il y a pas mal de sicles par la socit religieuse (judo chrtienne et je suppose pourquoi pas musulmane), ce concept a travers les temps et en plein 21ime sicle, les mres inculquent  leurs enfants la distinction entre femme de bonne ducation et femme facile. Malgr les diffrentes tentatives dvolution sociale, fminisme inclus, le concept de femme facile continue  marquer les gens. Une catgorie de femmes se fait appel femme libre ... mais nanmoins, il est trs difficile dimposer une vision de la femme plus ouvert, plus gal  celle de lhomme. Bien s?r, il est clair quavec ce concept de femme facile, il y a la contrepartie : la femme qui sortie de faire lamour pour une procration ne se montre pas rceptive  des relations sexuelles (donc peu dinitiative, peu dimmagination...bref plut?t barbante) et l, on dit que cest une frustre ou quelquechose dans le genre.  Merci  Cormoran et  Marc pour avoir des ides plus justes et plus propres au 21ime sicle.|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Bah ?a alors!!!    Non mais je m'insurge!!!    Non seulement je les respecte mais en plus je les honore!!!|`|NrVvr5M7aa	parce qu'ils prennent des femmes faciles pour des kleenex.    qui a du respect pour un kleenex ?      ce sont les memes mecs qui ralent contre les femmes pas faciles en les traitant de ste nitouche.  en bref, ils ne savent pas ce qu'ils veulent !!|`|1OcePDzQaa	d'abord, c'est quoi une femme facile? qui va coucher toute de suite avec toi?.... et alors.... ?a, c'est normal! parceque les gars ne sont-ils pas AUSSI faciles????????????|`|g8IzYaoHaa	Parce que si elles sont faciles, cela veux dire qu'elles ne se respectent pas.|`|4PWwnXlqaa	             A  VAINCRE  SANS  PERIL  ON TRIOMPHE SANS GLOIRE|`|0a5205a881264ea5be2b12a52f1988ceaa	Parce qu'elles sont faciles eh banane!!!|`|yHnjPWMfaa	Parce qu'elles sont trop faciles, justement. Crois-moi, les hommes me respectent|`|Fx37eT2faa	Pourquoi trouvez vous tous la question idiote ? elle a raison !!!     Les hommes, s'ils taient logiques, devraient tre reconnaissants aux femmes faciles d'tre faciles puisque c'est eux qui en profite il me semble.    Je ne vois pas ce que ?a leur rapporte de ne pas les respecter, qu'est ce que ?a peut bien leur faire ?|`|eepHjUNRaa	Parce qu'ils se disent qu'elles n'ont pas de dignit alors Dieu lui mme a respect celle-ci   |`|67c6f978049c23a75923890bda906575aa	Tout simplement parce que l'homme ce dit que la femme facil pour lui a t facil avec plein d autre avant ... Donc pas l'image de la femme pure. Ce qui me semble normal... |`|USLjAkOzaa	Parseque pour un homme qui a la firt mal plac pour lui une femme facile c'est une femme qui couche avec tt le monde hors sa, pour les hommes ds qu'ils savent que la femme a couch avec d'autres avant eux c'est les rends malades  ! et les hommes ne respecent que les femmes menteuses et hipocrites parsque ils aiment que les femmes leurs mentent ! |`|b88ecf4d9db95e2327487c92bfb12914aa	Les autres femmes ne les respectent pas non plus...  ?a me saoule toujours d'entendre des filles critiquer ou insulter d'autres filles sous prtexte qu'elles "couchent" plus rapidement/plus souvent (bref qui s'clatent elles), c'est faire le jeu des machos.    Quand  pourquoi les mec ne les respectent pas non plus, cela a s?rement  voir avec l'ducation o on apprend qu'il y a les filles avec lesquelles on couche et celle avec lesquelles on fait sa vie (de prfrence gentille, pas trop d'ex, mais bon si elle peut tre doue au lit quand mme c pas mal).  Breeeeeeeeef, ?a rejoint la problmatique des mecs qui s'etouffent lorsqu'il dcouvre que "horreur" la femme de leur vie a eu 10 fois plus d'amant que eux ont eu de ma?tresses. C'est un concept archa?que hrit d'un autre temps. Temps o la femme devait tre virge / na?ve / inexpriment / modelable  souhait...  Ces mecs sont juste des machos de base... ce n'est pas ncessaire d'ne dire plus...|`|sSr4gZ5naa	Femme facile ? dit oui une pute ou une femme passe partout;rien de sereiux dans cette rlation. ce dossier est clos et on en parle plus.|`|y0TO9NCIaa	parce qu'elles sont faciles....... c'est simple, non?|`|VPpxSDFbaa	parce que c'est pas facile ! |`|ya0ih9vbaa	Si le fa?t qu'une fille est eue plusieurs partenaires la dfinie comme tant une fille facile, alors aucun gars ne mrite le respect.

fAP6gMMcaa	les sexes toys sont devenus courant dans la sexualit moderne, je prfre cela au porno car l'image transmise par le porno ne reflte pas la ralit, les sex toys ne refltent pas la ralit non plus mais je pense qu'ils servent aussi bien  l'homme qu' la femme pour se connaitre intimement, ce sont des jeux, des accessoires  utiliser avec prcaution car on joue avec son corps tout de mme.     Maintenant la sexualit est riche, et c'est cela qui la rend si interessante,     Les sex toys sont utiles pour ceux qui en ressentent le besoin pour combler un manque passager, pour mieux se connaitre ou pour casser la routine et il n'y a rien de mal  ?a.    Par comparaison on pourrait associer la lingerie aux sex toys car celle-ci tient une place important dans nos rayons de magasins car elle a su se sophistiquer pour rpondre  une clientle coquine, mutine et extravertie, notre socit n'a pas attendu l'apparition des sexes toys  pour s'amuser avec ce qu'elle avait sous la main, la nourriture, les objets de tous les jours, tout est bon dans une certaine mesure evidemment.  La normalit n'existe pas dans notre socit il y a de tout pour faire notre monde tant que l'on ne fait n'importe quoi et que cela ne blesse personne pourquoi ne pas en profiter..     Amusons nous la vie est trop courte.....  |`|GdVRChSbaa	pourquoi t dit ca essaye le et donne ton avis|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Ecoute c'est comme pour la brosse  dent, c'est le progrs.

Un mec qui ferait pareil tu le qualifierais de quoi... de gigolo. Et aurais-tu le mme mpris pour lui?  "Elle couche par pur plaisir de satisfaire ses copains", c'est au moins un crime puni d'une vie entire sous les verrous ?a non?  Elle pourrait coucher pour son propre plaisir aussi tu y as pens ce serait pire encore, une vraie salope!  Elle se fait payer les fins de mois difficile, effectivement ?a s'apparente  de la prostitution, mais tu serais surpris du nombre de femmes qui en sont rduites  ?a "par contrainte". Elle, elle y prend du plaisir, c'est quand mme dj ?a de pris tu ne trouves pas?    C'est peut tre aussi une femme beaucoup plus fragile que ce que tu pense et qui ne trouves pas d'autrs moyens de se faire aimer que de coucher avec plein de mecs... Penses-y...

Arrte de la juger sur les ragots et regarde la comme un tre humain avec des qualits et des dfauts.

C'Est dj rater d'avance !! Dans tous les cas il y a deux choix , elle est nymphomane ou.. Prostitu ha ha! Se retrouver dans le lit de ton voisin comme sa.. C'est dr?le a la limite mais combien insens hahahaha      ET n'coute pas celle qui te dise Quelle peut bien faire se quelle veux de son corp..

Dans tout les cas, tant qu'elle se protge, personne n'a  juger son comportement, elle aime faire l'amour, pour se rassurer ou par pur plaisir, elle peut aussi aimer l'ide de se faire payer pour ?a...Franchement, elle couche pas seule, comment tu peux la juger si durement, alors que ton voisin qui la met dans son lit ou les autres, tu ne portes aucun jugement dessus?  Et depuis quand la prostitution est l'invention des femmes? (je ne parles pas spcialement pour elle, apparemment elle  un autre travail).

Le sducteur ou la sductrice cherche  satisfaire son amour de soi et son orgueil, il / elle peut mme faire renverser le jeu pour qu'il / elle soit la personne qui re?oit la drague.

La discussion est une cl de la russite d'une longue relation... Parler de quoi ? Des problmes et des frustration de chacun pour ensemble essayer de rgler les problmes.

J'espre pour toi qu'il est trs ouvert. |`|d8514d4c8b26a4be83833743503d83bbaa	La base d'une relation durable, je crois, c'est le dialogue et aussi la comprhension.  Mais il faut aussi tre  l'coute de l'autre pour pouvoir progresser vers l'avant ensemble.  Parait il que l'homme dans sa nature est polygame et la femme monogame et c'est pour cela kil est plus facile pour  les hommes de tromper leur femme.  Pour faire marcher une vie de couple il faut la contribution des 2 partenaires.La tentation existe toujours mais vous pouvez lutter ensemble.  L'apparence compte aussi!Essayez d'tre toujours prsentable k vous soyez un homme ou une femme.Faut toujours attirer son centre d'intert vers vous|`|a808d788a9233bead7d90388bf5256f4aa	non ! surtout ne dis rien.    un conseil : de toute fa?on, si quelqu'un d'autre te tente dis toi bien que ce sera pareil avec ce quelqu'un au bout d'un certain temps.    Et si lui te trompait, comment tu le vivrais ?    ne lui dis rien mais rflchit bien avant d'agir, beaucoup y ont laiss des plumes pour pas grand chose au final !|`|R54jDPkXaa	Bonjour,  Oui je pense qu'il faut en parler avec son partenaire, si on tien vraiment  cette relation,  la personne avec qui l'on est!!! Si le couple est solide, malgr les disputes et si l'amour est sincre, c'est sur qu'il y aura une grosse dispute, qui entrainera une bonne discution et qui pourrait certainement rgler le problme. Si vous vous aimez vraiment, vous ferez chacun des efforts pour redonn de la vie, du piment et de la joie dans votre couple!  Ce sont des choses qui arrivent dans tous les couples, alors il ne faut pas oubli qu'on aime la personne avec qui on est et ne pas tre tent par une histoire d'un soir qui risque de foutre en l'air une vrai histoire d'amour!!!! La confiance et la complicit son l'essentiel dans un couple, il faut juste avoir la manire d'anoncer la chose! Alors courage!|`|MaaURyfxaa	La routine ne provoque pas forcment l'infidlit, de mme que l'infidlit n'est pas ncessairement une fa?on de tester son charme.    La vie de couple n'est pas simple, c'est s?r. Cela dit, l'on s'vite beaucoup de quiproquos et de situations dlicates par le dialogue,  condition que les deux partenaires y soient ouverts.  Il faut discuter avant que l'envie d'aller voir ailleurs se fait sentir, parce qu'en gnral, lorsque le dsir de consommer ailleurs appara?t, c'est un peu tard.    Maintenant, c'est un avis personnel bien s?r !|`|v3fQF6MUaa	je prefere les question sur les merguez ! :)! dsole ....    http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|3jx30juaaa	la fidlit est une connerie mais au dbut, on pense le contraire.|`|IVeeJddWaa	je penses qu'il serai mieux d'tre sur de ce que l'on veut.

aozZNp8aaa	yes i think there is nothing wrong with mixed race people.|`|01wTbVEMaa	I'm multiracial too! I'm african,german, welsh, and scottish. It's always fun when people ask what your heritage is because you have more than one!|`|UCKAiLN1aa	I think multiracial guys are really good looking, well depends on what races are in their genes. I like asian/caucasian or asian/german/irish/etc. I don't like darker guys but that's just me. Asian mixes are the best looking to me. :)|`|apufwtUAaa	i guess it depends on what cultures they are,  your mix sounds beautiful!, you should post a pic.  but i personally like tanned farmer looking guys, haha.|`|LsHkgexvaa	I think you are a beauty! The tanned skin, the dark hair and hazel eyes would melt any heart. And I bet you already knew the answer, you know your beautiful!|`|3IQq3FPSaa	I think that mixed race girls are absolutely gorgeous! The more mixed up the better! Because then they look more exotic and very sexy! It seems that they get the best attributes from each race that they're mixed with. Personally, I'm mixed with Black, Cherokee, and Creek Indians! I love my heritage and being all mixed up myself! I think I got some white in me too somewhere.

JsPgyD9zaa	just give him a second chance, go for it. first dates you cant really always tell exactly how the person acts. maybe hell show you something you like tonight. your entire opinion about him can change. plus first dates are awkward and sometimes people dont act like themselves because theyre nervous or whatever. so i would just go for it, and then if youre still not into em then just cut it off and thats thaaat.|`|FzHaIu8laa	If you don't think the second date will kick things off, then you need to end it now.|`|AhhMzIBGaa	I would take a second date with someone i just met to at least give them one more chance and if you really don't like him then its not like you have to see him everyday afterward.|`|ugvgt6rMaa	I say you give the guy a chance. Like when you start to get to know him then you'll realize your true feeling toward him. If you like him go out with him if not then just be friends.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	if you have to question it then i say no. Dont go.|`|AA10859079	Give it a second chance.  People are nervous and not usually themselves on first dates.  If there is still no spark or at least some added interest on your part, end it.

u2zc2bO1aa	talked to me before bed every night, built me a zebra from build a bear, put a necklace around it, and gave it to me for christmas, fell in love with me, took care of me, supported me in everything, kissed me on the forehead everytime we were together, never pressured me, talked to me for hours on end, went through all of my problems with me, played with my hair, held it back for me when i was sick, wiped away my tears, texted me every morning just to say "i love you sweetie, have a good day!"    he's my amazing "unofficial fiancee" :)|`|LhcN7Ygraa	paid my rent!|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	well, this is one of them: called me every night to tell me to have sweet dreams and that he loved me. he would always be there for me... and he hoped that my dreams would be filled w/ him b/c his dreams were! well, we broke up and hes gay and on drugs. ya, i know! :) lol. hope i helped! if i didnt i hope someone else helps you bye :)
pLGMqqBFaa	He probably likes you  just go for it and see what could happen  you never know|`|eqWftUQeaa	Lol how cute... just go sit by him again and say "hi" its not hard.. LOL talk about rap music, test him on his skills|`|sNZItLQHaa	Flirt with him!  If you think he might be into you then you gotta respond.  Just be yourself!  Make conversation, but don't sound desperate...that might scare him!|`|RVqw1C8baa	start talking to him!  if hes blasting rap music use your music skills and say "i love that song!!" and then start a conversation from that|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I would say that he was trying to get your attention since blasting your music is only going to do one thing and make some people look at you. Next time you see him just talk to him and start flirting.|`|CeyuSMT9aa	a white guy acting black... the perfect amount of danger|`|xH4JDDwVaa	i didnt know you were black....anyway maybe your over racting....good luck though|`|cdYLdNFqaa	sure, its because ur cute,  and yes,  he wouldnt  blast the music,  hed put it on a more appropriate  volume limit if he wasnt trying to get ur attention, lol return the favor by explain why that girl is so into me|`|YWdNTZU3aa	blasting rap music  wow white guys can be so crazy  well i like it when a girl talks to me first  don't worry if he is interested in you are not  i mean what you got to lose  from what i see you look good and if he is looking at you from the corner of his eye i am sure he thinks you look good also  when you see him  flirt with him  you seem like you can do that  and talk to him|`|adc2f928ad5c1e7ed865593e8e9aa8f1aa	Just sit by him again and say hi....Maybe he was trying to show you that he is into you (in a funny, cutesy way)!    Good Luck|`|161ffeb32b98010f90ea85350b5049e7aa	I think the next time you see him you should go up to him and start conversation with him. That way he would think that your into him and maybe he could come out and say to you he's interested. Its kinda of weird that he's blasting rap music and your the only black girl in your class if i was you i would think he's tryna get your attention. So don't be afraid i'm the type of girl that would just go up to you so just do it.
av8SeB3Naa	I have to say you're joking.  With how you look, the word 'ugly' doesn't really come to mind.  You're pretty. Maybe not model material, but you're still pretty.

I'd love a girlfriend like you.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	no your not ugly :) whom ever said that is stupid|`|Tf19RETiaa	thats so rude, i cant believe someone would say that!  your not ugly at all, dont listen to that stupid person.|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	don't pay attention and get all bent out of shape by jealous school girls, you are far from ugly but you can make some easy great improvments by not forcing the smile which appears to be put on, as well as your hair is pretty and a nice color but you could stylish a little or let it grow a little longer and tell the girl to fu-- off.|`|b7gUW0CRaa	not at all|`|yQn34zO7aa	ur not ugly at ALL. ur really pretty the person who said that is obviously blind|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Honey, whoever said that needs their eyes examined!  You're very attractive...|`|sZePlWTQaa	You are not at all ugly!! Everyone has their own preference on what they like! Just like you think some guys are ugly when other girls think they aren't. Don't let it affect you. You are a beautiful girl! It will get better and hopefully nicer guys once you LEAVE highschool!!..lol|`|rzPIO1aQaa	you are not ugly at all. don't listen to stupid people they have nothing better to do than put someone down probably because they feel bad about themselves and it makes them feel better to down you. Just smile and tell her or him where to shove it. you are beautiful and you have a great smile so enjoy life and don't worry about the dumb a**es.
W0XoDxJraa	yeah, I was kinda nervous, but I had known hom for years and we were very close, so I was secure in our relationship and very close.  It was actually a really great experience. Minimal pain. He was experienced so perhaps that had something to do with it. But more to the point, he made me relaxed beforehand, and boosted my confidence throughout. Years down the line, we're still together!
goP5E0Kxaa	Well how much do you have in common? Not that it matters, but it's nice to have things in common. How often are you two pulled back into convos together?    Does he look, smell his best for you ?     Does he look you in the eyes ?    Does he act loose, and confident, and la lala lala la la around you?    There are signs , but as friends, why not just ask him if he wants to see a film with you or something. Just ask him to places as a friend, and if he sweeps you off your feet, if you love the time together, then why not officialiate it?|`|LfBptxrcaa	I Think Hes Intrested Definately,Since When Is A Guy Intrested In A Girls Opponion :| x|`|SB0aZTf7aa	He probably likes you.    Ask him if he wants to hang out or something
u9ewvqJuaa	I HAVE a feeling you two don't communicate do you? If you did, you probably would have talked to him before posting a question on the internet.    Talk to him, tell him what's on your mind. If you won't or feel you can't your relationship probably isn't that great.    Also consider what some others have said - the economy is in shambles, no one has much money. And the shirt might have been a sentimental gift.|`|IG4A4nuDaa	the economy is in shambles, maybe he is cutting back... accept every gift as a gift from the hearthttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|1SK6qPA6aa	its because he spends all of his money on crack?|`|JEnGz5I4aa	he probably put a lot of thought into that and that all that matters. and maybe he wanted to know that you would be OK with whatever he gave you|`|Od4v2a8Baa	If that's all you care about is money and sex it doesn't sound like it's a good relationship that will actually work.. and if it is a legitimate reason why he only bought you that shirt then I am sure he is VERY hurt by your reaction.|`|gpb74wKmaa	no comment.    actually, here's one: that's soooo insanely conceded. ever heard of "its the thought that counts"??   maybe he's having some $ trouble. maybe he loves you enough to think that material gifts shouldn't matter so much in your relationship. maybe, just maybe, you should appreciate that you actually got something 4 x-mas. there a lot of people out there that don't get ANYthing.    think about THAT.|`|3SJPp8Mkaa	sounds funny but i think he only ment it as a joke|`|3glmptC7aa	I don't feel its the price of the object you should be worried about! He got you something, maybe he had a few more people to budget this year then before.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Maybe he had a lot of expenses at that time. And who cares if it was only a $5 shirt if you liked it? It's not the cost, it's the caring. Be glad you got a present at all.     And now you're withholding sex from him b/c you think his present was cheap? So he has to pay more to be with you? There's a word for that but I won't type it.|`|L0uZPWEmaa	hey dont be so hard on her, maybe shes just woried her bf is spending less on her cos hes going off her or spending his cash on another woman!!|`|XkRGEnL4aa	well did the shirt have to do with something you guys have talked about before?  like maybe an inside joke or something?  or maybe it represents your love in some way?    don't start thinking he's the bad person in the relationship, because you're the one who's making a big deal out of a present he really didn't haaave to give you.  it's the thought that counts.|`|tUSx6V0Paa	wow. just...WOW.|`|reNmh3rWaa	Jesus, you care about the price of the shirt?  You're shallow as hell.  He should seriously dump you.  You don't sound like a very nice person to be with >_>|`|ANC7G909aa	welllll your a little materialistic it seems.  maybe he was just testing to see if you were in it for the money or not... nd if he was it seems he would find out that you are... so i say if you actually like him you should do him and wear that t-shirt more often. if not, and it really bothers you that he didnt spend a lot you should just move on becuase youre only hurting him|`|qYmDZbW2aa	Wow, you're disgusting.  You're lucky enough to have someone.

I think your a lousy girlfriend, good job (sarcastic)|`|OcISFpRdaa	it's the thought that counts. don't be so selfish... maybe that's all he could afford at the time|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	mayb he was broke and couldnt afford a nicer gift  ur being self centered b happy u got anything god!!!!!|`|JDQP0Phraa	Wow, you sound like a total prostitute!

6agX2Attaa	It seems as if you like him and are developing feeling for him make this go slowly and see how it goes if you feel you are ready n he could like u then tell otherwise wait a while|`|cn2B9ebJaa	this is very vague    the way uve described it, it cant just b a desire to b with someone. u only said wonderful things    wat exactly makes u think its some kinda desire to b with someone (even though we all want that)    but this isnt enuff info. to even try to answer, dont even get y u asking it|`|vdLVLW38aa	Hmm.  Try to image yourself kissing him or just being very close to him.  Can you see that? Do you like what you see?  If you do like him, just kind of give him hints. Act more flirty around him.|`|6DXJJzEUaa	need more info|`|cW7RXq8Qaa	Well its not love because your not even with him yet. You really like him and are infatuated with him. Love is something that is shared between two people and you've said it aloud.|`|4VDbwLJnaa	have a friend tell him! thats wat i do! or get his   and text him it! thats wat i do! i told a guy 1 time and thats it cuz im a complete chicken!lol have good luck!|`|kV5YqHvfaa	Desire is the bottom line.|`|HOl6N45iaa	desire unless you know him alot and are friends then maybe it''s love
Tf19RETiaa	you should of told her before since you've liked her for a long time.  you could tell her now and she might feel the same or you could be too late. good luck =)|`|td6WXhv4aa	Find someone else he was there first.|`|2U5cUwAfaa	Just probaby move on. Sorry i have to tell you this.   There are some other good girls out there. Going out with this other guys pretty much means that she doesn't really want to go out with you. She just probably likes you as a friend.  But if she shows lovey dovey feeling for you then maybe just wait and if she breaks up wtih her boyfriend. try to make some moves!
k1FenuRLaa	if u look really innocent, enhance the size of ur eyes and lashes, don't wear too much makeup and make very strong eye contact with him. practice ur look in the mirror, or just try and build up to the same situation as u did the last time u kissed|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Talk to him, with your face just close enough   to his mouth, that he can smell your breath."|`|4SHb1kUAaa	nice makeup  smell good  sexy looking|`|TMi1GhSHaa	the way her eyes sparkle when she looks at you.. im no lez lol but thats is what my guy friend is said.
XYfp4mbtaa	Any guy who does that is someone that you do not want to be around. Guys like that just want to use you. Act serious and tell this guy that you have no attraction to him at all and that no matter what he does, he will not get his way. Just be honest about it. Telling him that you believe he is unattractive will probably change his mind because he will be offened.|`|bXGgFhRjaa	Yea, one time, a guy was saying all these really sweet things to me and then he told me he liked me. He asked if I liked him back, and I felt like I couldn't say no after he had said all these incredibly nice things to me. I never had to date him or anything, but the next day I felt guilty for lying.|`|4yTx07Pxaa	just be honest and let em know you're not ready to do that yet. alot of guys like that and are attracted to you more cuz you''re "innocent" .. but hold you're ground and let em know you'r don't wanna.|`|v8jwzTGyaa	yeah. lol for my first kiss [i know that's not that big of a deal]  ive always imagined my first kiss to be romantic and private and stuff but my boy friend at the time wanted to kiss me and I wanted to kiss him to but not in front of a lot of people. so like after school everyone was watching us kiss and it was kinda annoying and then I got really mad at him, cuz he knew i didn't wanna kiss him there but he kept saying "so do you wanna kiss me or not..?!"|`|ojaNzhsIaa	i know exactly wht you mean, it depends on who it is. if its someone you like but aren't ready for, then just straight up tell him, i like you but i'm not ready for this, if its someone you don't really care for, then tell them you didn't brush your teeth or something, i hope i helped a little.|`|5k9XizbMaa	Lol yeah, I just tell them to back off. I mean you can definitely hurt them worse with one swift kick to the balls than they can hitting you or something.|`|Lx1w6z4Naa	"come on, get me, baby"|`|rGnlUEpyaa	surprisingly, i havnt. My first kss was with the guy im with now, we were together then. I wanted to kiss first, but he said he wanted to wait tell the time was right. A few weeks later he surprised me, but didnt pressure me. When we made out for the first time, it was natural, and he didnt forse me to. Like we were just kissing and it turned into making out. He doesnt pressure me though, he always asks for my permission, and doesnt care when I say no. When we were making out he even asked before he touched me....well kinda, he started to move his hand and stopped, and looked at me untill i said it was fine. But he is my first close boyfriend and he doesnt do anything with out asking usually....|`|9b8fa166dc569bc5bbfc609864036c7daa	no, i haven't been put into any of those type of situations. I have a tendency to stay out of things like that.  But I imagine that I would hit him or say something about it. A good kick in the balls or a strict talking to should do you fine. If you have a guy that is doing this to you, then you need to set him straight and tell him whats what.|`|7p2IknBOaa	"DUDE, back off!"|`|z3AGPUh2aa	say no its too soon duh women think|`|jHHVkKQvaa	get ur friend 2 ring u (gud distraction ) or try laughing or making a joke until ur ready 2 gt serious!  x|`|0Mu5kIX7aa	This is what b**** slapping is for.|`|I4tgCKQ9aa	punch the guy in the privates|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Yeah i was pressured but he knows my weakness and i just gave in because then i wanted to kiss him but he kept trying to kiss me and i would be like don't kiss me i don't want you touching me or anything so get away from me.|`|OCHhJWpHaa	i was pressured but not in that way..making out and stuff.. i was pressured not to see any guys, as in friends.. henging out ****... and um.. i cant dye my hair, pierce my ears...and be myself...|`|l2mJxB1Caa	tell him your not into him or if you are, that you are not ready for that step|`|3rDbLSZBaa	well my ex boyfriend always pressured me to do things with him and i dint lilke it because im not doing anything till im married. he said stuff if you love me you will or sometimes hed threaten to tell my mom stuff only he knew|`|gYuJUyvvaa	If a guys asks you if he can kiss you, that's nice and that's good and sure you can say no he probably won't mind.    Anything beyond that is a no, if he pressures you, aim for the cheek bone. If he keeps pressuring you, aim lower, much lower.
7u8hX3Hkaa	I wouldn't have taken 7 months to get her bent over , now that's a fact !|`|AA11155768	First, there's a good chance this guy is lying so you won't go back to his wife and mention that you saw him and his mistress together.  2nd, if she did tell him that, that's between her and her husband and has nothing to do with you...even if she asks for your opinion. If she's happy with this decision, who are we to judge? There are lots of things going on behind closed doors that many of us can't begin to imagine...and I'd like to keep it that way.|`|796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	Honestly, reading that made my head hurt! What a mess that situation is. I can't believe a wife would pawn her husband off on her friend and condone their relationship. That's so messed up.    Be thankful you're not involved. That's a messy situation that will blow up in the wife's face at some point! I doubt she's looked ahead to the possibilities that the friend and husband could fall in love.     Crazy crazy!  Brit|`|UMylG80waa	its their choice and they are adults, they can make upi their own minds about what is right and wrong...  it is no ones place to judge them either|`|OzREW683aa	I just don't understand, I think it's wrong, on so many levels...but thats just me|`|F5IcNScMaa	I think she is having a affair on him and will use it against him later on    And if i were him i would bang the hell out of her friend behind her back because it's not as much fun when the wife knows.|`|tbJraueLaa	go for it the marriage is over anyways.|`|aIgNU5PUaa	I hear that some married couples can make this "open" concept work but I don't personally know any.  I think it all sounds fine but once he does sleep with the friend, the wife will be hurt by it.  Talking about it and actually going through with it are two different things.  Also, it opens the door for him to spend more time with the friend than with the wife, not good!|`|w87jwOaOaa	If that what they all agree on then go for it.  But why on earth would you go out in public and only embarrass your wife, make yourself look like a jack*** and then have the bf called every name in the book.  Some things are best done on the low.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	I like it! Maybe if the wife joined in she'd get her libido back...?|`|KAoNgzcFaa	Wow i think it's cool    |`|bVhtA9iHaa	thats just weird! you should go tell that dude that he ought to go see a sex therapist with his wife and stop making out with her stand in!|`|QujHMTmBaa	Yeah, those situations are awkward. He shouldn't be doing it. It's still adultery. My husband encourages me to have sex with other men. I haven't though. He wants me to though becuase he gets off on the idea not for the same reasons as the wife. The husband should be trying to different ways to arouse his wife and got to marriage counseling or on a sex retreat. I guarantee she's hurting despite the fact that it was her own idea to allow him to engage in adultery.|`|CQnlxYk4aa	Do you believe everything you here from a stranger. I believe they made it up and had there fun watching you freak out. Maybe you did like the idea, of that story. Hmmmm. |`|Ih18jMNyaa	My wife has a low sex drive!  After each child was born and she was nursing them her low drive went to a "ZERO" drive!  Right now our 4th child is 5 months old and my wife still hasn't gotten back the sex drive.  So I have been without intercourse for 6 months, BUT my wife wants to be in the mood (just isn't) and will give me a hand job every now and then and some oral too!      IF she were to offer her friend for sexual services I would be offended!  I married my wife for better or worse and I vow to show her unconditional love too.  Just because she has a low drive and at times a zero drive I would NEVER go somewhere else!   What do I do?  MASTURBATE while thinking about my wife!|`|DytsjZKpaa	i say, get her. after he does, tell the wife and 90 % of the time, the fire will come lit again. |`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you could ask the wife and see for your self sounds like bull to me |`|fRIEHBJOaa	that's crazy! maybe his wife is a lesbian and truly not interested in sex with him, but loves him anyways and doesnt want to lose him.    after 7 months, and i had permission, i would hook up with someone, but never a best friend or family member; rather, a complete stranger.    too risky w/ friends/family. it's gonna come bite you on the ***, that's for sure!
DOShS8q0aa	Just call him a fag or gay or something. Dudes don't like that. Or call him jack off|`|ceedUcNHaa	yeah, but first . .  what's the nick names he came up with 4  You?  it could make     some difference .  .  ?|`|So9QnB4maa	I say Sperm, or even Vagina.

h9ttFN7Taa	funny thing -- i have a friend who is in the same dilemma. i think you should not tell anybody like a shout out or anything but dont keep it a secret. if you audition for a solo or something and someone asks "you like to SING???" you should just simply reply "yes. you never nknew that?" . that is what i would do if i were you.|`|AQpt6m0Xaa	haha when I read your question I thought that it would say something like "i'm a lesbian" or some really deep secret lol.    anyways you just need to relax, a lot of people like to sing. it's funny because I also love singing and acting and happen to be very good at it. But, I'm also a really competitive swimmer so people don't really expect that from me. Also i'm a guy and singing is not really considered a very manly thing to do. A few years ago i auditioned for a local but fairly big production of les miserables and got one of the leading parts (marius). I had to miss several swim practices and my teammates are like my best friends so I had to tell them. I was so nervous just like you because I thought they would think it really strange that a person like me was into that kinda stuff. I was suprised when I told them cause they were all just like thats awsome. and they all wanted to go see the production.   You shouldn't be so worried about it. They are your friends and will never change their opinion about you. And you don't need to just tell them. You could hint just by singing all the time. Or if they mention something about singing you could jsut be like " I love singing". and trust me they are not going to care if you are bad because there is a good chance that they are worse. also no one judges people by there voice. so just let them know and that is that. and maybe you will make new friends that also like to sing or maybe you will find out that they also love to sing.    I hope this helps you :)
ykPN1GCPaa	try taking a deep breath.
f8auCNQvaa	Have him over for a couple movies at your house. Just the two of you. It'll progress from there.  Promise.|`|zNDqBwMAaa	Say it to his face, be confident.|`|IDVFsy5waa	Just TELL him.  dont stress over it
GqhtePhgaa	It's hard to answer this because I can't look into his eyes.  But my advice would be:    Don't be naive    People with good game will say whatever they have to say to get what they want.  You are emotionally involved and so are not in the best position to see things.  Your friends sound like they are giving you the best advice.  But, ultimately, it's your call.    Good luck.
riC03pclaa	do what you feel is right. if they will be mean to you because you date this guy f*ck them, you don't need their f*cking opinions anyway. if you like someone the rest of the world shouldn't care.
IN1X1CVGaa	umm the best time for sex is when you want it  in the bed is the best place  it doesnt matter what they're wearing  your gonna be taking it off    make it special  and close to last  have some fun first and spend time together  then go for the sex! :D|`|bdwjN1MKaa	anytime  bed or couch or even car just alone  anything|`|7XIa76Usaa	1 - anytime you have privacy   2 - front seat of a car works great, you/or he can slide out to the edge of the seat   3 - nothing, being completely nude is by far the best  Open your mind completely and enjoy the fantastic feelings. Make sure you are taking a birth control pill,, condoms break. Concentrate on the feelings and let your pleasure roll freely. Do not try holding anything back.
IF6MjjBbaa	than ask him out lol duhh
d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Ok, well, I am going to be blunt, but it is not you.  You seem like the type of person who is like me, so I can relate to this.  I had the same type of problem where my in laws did not really except me.  They only ever wanted to see her, never "us".  The littlest thing would drive them nuts, etc.  You should sit with your parents and explain to them that your decision is made and that you are old enough to make your own decisions in life.  The support that they can show you in appreciated, but once they try to control your life like they did by trying to get you to marry someone else, this is wrong.  They took your passports, etc.  This is wrong on all levels.  You are your own person and your parents need to except that.  If they can not except you for who you are and what you choose, and they try to change you so it makes them happy, this is not love.  Love is acceptance, love is kind, love is everything that is good.  The same thing happened with me, me and my wife never got support.  She got support, but her parents never supported "us".  I would get into arguments with her over how I felt and I sometimes felt like I was being ganged up on because she would not talk to them about it and tell them to back off.  She only talked to them one day when I requested her to, I wanted to know how they felt about me.  I felt that they controlled her life, her parents were very controlling people and had a huge influence on her.  Based on my experiences, I know that the both of you (you and your husband) love each other.  What you should do one day is plan for a week long trip together, only the two of you.  Take no cell phones, take no means of communication with you so your parents can not get a hold of you.  Just have a lone time together.  Talk with your husband and tell him that you will talk to your parents that they need to accept this.  I feel that your parents are the root cause to why all this is happening between your husband.  I think this because your parents are getting in the way of your life, they try to control you, they try to arrange a marriage even though you are already happily married (controlling), they give you a rough time and your husband is caught right smack in the middle of it and he wants to not be in conflict.  All the conflict and controlling your parents are doing is driving him nuts, same thing happened with me.  We had a lot of arguments about her parents and brother, and I feel you are in the same boat I was.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|3OFExSwTaa	Show him that you love him with your actions....  Remind him everyday that you love him, treat him like the gold that you are supposed to. Play your part in making decisions that will get you out of debt, stick with your husband through this tough time and he will love yoyu forever...I promise.|`|bdiuW66paa	are you serious.   talk to your husbnad that you love him alot and he might change then there is no solution.|`|Yxhw69EFaa	Sweetie you need to ask yourself if you are actually DOING anything to improve your marriage? Are you working on it to make it better? A good marriage is NEVER handed to you on a silver platter..it takes WORK from both sides.  As far as your parents are concerned...i realize there are two different cultures here...but love is love...plain and simple! It sounds like right now your parents are poison for you marriage...you need to separate yourself from that kind of negativity and do what you feel in your heart is best for YOU!

XH2o1MM6aa	.Listen honey,guys don't waste time with girls they don't like.This guy is crazy about you.So ask him next time is there an "letter" in the girl's name (one of the missing ones) if he says yes.Then reply "She likes you too".And accept his offer of dancing|`|lbeHwVGTaa	You can never be sure. Hang around him more. And if you happen to see him(don't stalk him though) talking to another girl. See how he acts and then ask him if he likes her. Now if he treats u a diffrent way, it doesn't mean he doesn't like u like that, it could possibly mean that he's more comfortable with u then with other girls, which could be to ur advantage.|`|KQqZF63oaa	I think he likes you!  Definetely he made it pretty obvious to me.  Well  when he asks you who you like tell him that you won't tell him unless he tells you first.  And does he smile at you a lot?  nd i think he likes you.  Good luck :]!
PTYHS1LDaa	Maybe, he liked you, too, but since you stopped, he became sad....maybe mad at you?  I would say he still likes you, but just does not know how to say it too you.  I would confront him, and ask him what's going on?  What a jerk move to talk to your friend, and not acknowledge you.  But he still likes you, maybe making you jealous with the talking to your best friend, and all that.  And the eye contact when walking in through the bathroom door...  He still likes you, and it is funny if he thinks he can change anything by acting this way.....hahaha.   Good Luck with him!
V0muobgFaa	No, just keep the secret.  She'll understand.  It won't be easy, but maybe you should avoid talking to her until it's over.
ArfWE1Ykaa	not everyone likes to make new friends. some people are just not as accepting as other people. in highschool, theres a lot of cliques because they feel like they're too cool to make any more friends. if your friends move away, try to make new friends. its not hard, but you just have to find good people that will accept you for you. just don't try to act like someone you're not.|`|comuT2fkaa	i like making new friends. it's fun.  i'm pretty much friends with everyone.

Just say something along those lines, I know how you feel hun, and it's hard, and it gets pretty annoying.    I wish you the BEST of LUCK!

The fact that he is your brother's best friend could complicate any future relationship.  Step carefully and let it develop naturally.
AA11155768	This is really a question that only you can answer. How long have you been together? How was your relationship? Is it possible that he feels intimidated that you popped the question instead of waiting for him to ask?    Financial strain is very hard on marriage so he could be right in wanting to wait. If you decide to wait it out, then take the time to finish school if you haven't already and put some money away and support him as he does the same.     Good luck!|`|AA11125475	Those sound like flimsy reasons to me. If you love him you'll stay. |`|bf6K6uubaa	he answered your question..with a "no".  enough said.  respect yourself and move on|`|J5QfDZ1Naa	if he was that unsure, then u love him more than he loves u which at this point in the game-when u want to marry him-won't work. i agree that u deserve a guy who will be crazy for you and possibly even ask u. maybe u could take a breeak from him to see what else is out there. maybe he can see how he feels and clear his head so that u guys can be on the same page- or close the book. there's hope, but u guys just need to know where each other stands.|`|vPXuPdlvaa	Not sure but did your boyfriend say he would not marry you ever or just not now? That's the big important one to think about. If he feels he doesn't want to marry you now just because of his job or money situation then maybe you need to talk to him and tell him that those are not the reasons you are marrying him and while there important to you because there important issues in his life they are not deal breakers in your possible future marriage. However he may feel like he wants his life more in order before he permanently decides to share it with another. You should only stay in the relationship if you feel it is going places. If he's given all he can give or is willing to give and you want more, then you're going to have move on and find that elsewhere. You just need to talk to him and decide for yourself if the relationship is going to grow at any point and if it's worth the wait.|`|wknx9Oswaa	How long have you been together? How come you were the one proposing and not the other way around? If you think you are both ready and he gives you this reason then it's time to really give your relationship a very serious thought. Maybe you're not on the same page or his just taking his sweet time or you're not the one he would like to marry? Make a list of his attributes both positive and negative and your attributes as well. If you jive then give him another six months maybe? if not then the right guy is just waiting round the corner maybe?|`|4XlXOIKRaa	 You have to give him credit for being honest.  I would say have a long talk with him and find out what are  his money problems.  If he is short  on money now, this is exactly what you will be marrying and this could be a source of problems in the marriage. What's the rush for marriage?|`|RruclpfSaa	First I don't think you should be the one to propose, but everyone does things their own way I guess, and if he truly wanted to be with you like that money shouldn't matter. You should sit down and ask him if he see's it going anywhere because if not there's no need to keep leading you on|`|lb7exqUgaa	wow. well, if he was ready dont you think he would have asked you first? he might be telling the truth, but also is he worried about paying for the wedding or being stable in general? cause im sure your families would help you out. but it just sounds like you two are in two different paths. i think i would break up. but thats just me|`|IKLl68LAaa	it seems as though he is wanting to create a secure environment for you both to begin with before you marry each other. Stay with him, it seems as though his head is on straight. if you love him enough to ask him to marry you, there has to be more in it than leaving him because he says no. Time will tell. |`|NxPETl2laa	Your boyfriend is worried that  he wont be a good enough husband to you. he wants a better job and be able to provide you with the best of the best. He wants to be better for you before he is married to you. Don't take his decision to hard. To him he's not good enough for you yet. |`|Mvm9rrW5aa	Wow to be honest...sounds like hes cheating on you. Or hes just not worth it.     If you really love him stay with him. But if I was to ask my guy to marry me (and I am engaged) and he said no and I really loved him I dont know what I would do. Make a list of all the good things about the relationship and a list of all the bad. If the bad outweighs the good then maybe you should move on.|`|4RO89Fmmaa	well for starters his answer didn't seem like it turn out good if he had to wait TWO weeks to answer !!!  if he loves you enough he wouldn't let you down like that just because he's not happy with his "job" its not like your planning to marry the next day it takes time to plan a wedding if you want some thing big or even if its thought court its not like your gonna rush into it ! i feel likes he's scared of commitment and giving off excuses!|`|11z4SUaNaa	If you have to ask questions like that then usually the answer is No you shouldn't stay because if the relationship was ok you would not have any doubt about it. And the man should be the one proposing not you! But ok, you did and it took him 2 weeks to let you know, Your Red Flag should have went up. He's making excuses. Move on and find someone that will be true to you. If he is not man enough to tell you that he doesn't want to be with you then you don't need him anyway. If he really loved you or wanted to be with you, he would discuss a way to work it out, not give you a flat out no. |`|iAphlpqKaa	yess you cant just base your relationship on the status. if you love eachother then why does it matter if your married or not? its the love that counts not the money|`|ZUbVjA37aa	girl i think u should get rid of this guy and get one who is crazy about u and will say yes before you even ask the question|`|U3lGxxsLaa	yes. he seems to have your best interests in mind and wants to have a stable and happy job so not to bring you down. |`|Al8E78bvaa	damn, that's tough.  i say that if took him 2 weeks to answer then he doesn't deserve you.  Also, he doesn't know what the hell he wants - and i'm a guy.  you can do better, there are PLENTY of us around.|`|XIRDMn8daa	stay. obviously he wants to marry you but he isn't rady financially.  thats how a lot of marriages fail. financial problems.  i say stay. let him work out his problems and get his money right.  then maybe he will ask you!  :)|`|Z5LqRfeLaa	Read the book, "He is just not that into you". There is a section talking about "a guy who does not want to marry you". |`|OgTTMTqvaa	oyu should stay if you believe hes the one  he just probably says no because he doesnt make engough money to support you an him he needs to have a house and everything in order to say yes well at least to make it last through together|`|DgpDXZalaa	Wait, you proposed to him?  I mean if you love him and your willing to wait for him then yeah.  But if y'all are on two different pages in the relationship, then it's not good.|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	At least he was honest.  However, if you aren't happy then move on.  If you think you can live with continuing to be a girlfriend then keep at it.|`|nM81FJT2aa	i think you stay for more times and see if things change ........  if he is putting in effort to make more money and start a new life with you.........    if he is not do what you got to do........|`|hHCEi4peaa	i would say ask urself if u are ready to leave him and if u do then see how it is for a while if u want him back then do it im sure he is goin through a tough time with his job and he doesn't need the financial stress of a marriage |`|iisqIueTaa	iF HE REALLy LOVES U AND U REALLy LOVE HiM THEN STAy 2GETHER BUT U GUyS DONT HAVE 2 GET MARRIED RiGHT AWAy TAKE UR TiME TO DO SO.

Doesn't sound like that's a deal breaker.  If the two of you love each other what good would come from leaving him?  |`|oZbJ2FAvaa	wow two weeks is a really long time.There are such things as long engagements, is it the job he's not liking... or is it you.Makes you wonder... what will the next excuse be? |`|37YWnVZ7aa	you'll have to ask yourself, can you wait for him?    If you can't, will you be able to break up with him?    if you can, will you be able to find Mr Right out there?How soon will it be?    2 weeks for an asnwer must mean he really thinks it thru|`|SUzwPZGwaa	Find someone who's really going to treat you well.  You want to spend the rest of your life with someone who's crazy about you, not just so-so.  You deserve the best!|`|aRGqMQpiaa	Yes bcause he thinks u will cost to much money!
ef92c907005ba336b0d425a8daa321b9aa	I think your mom is being really hard on you because maybe she expects better... sometimes parents have such high expectations that when us as kids do not meet those expectations they get very disappointed. What you should do is try to talk to her in a calm matter without having emotions involved. I know that when I was living with my parents and I felt that I could not talk to them, I would write them a letter and let them know. After that they would try to understand. But eventually I left because of drama. We do not need that kind of stress. If she does not change then what you have to do is stop trying to please her. You are not Useless and do not let anyone tell you that you are...I know its hard ...oh believe me I know how hard it is because all you want to do is make them happy... but your going to stress yourself out to much. So just take care of you.and when you are able to move out and believe me when you do things will be different because you will see you are way way way stronger then what you thought    Good luck and let me know how it goes|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	If you are that unhappy find a way to move out!
Ikd9cppcaa	Look at the calendar and pencil in some "date" times. Then make sure you have a nice date with each other. It doesn't have to be anything expensive and can be as simple as making a meal together and watching a rented movie. Keep in mind if you aren't married maybe the commitment to the relationship isn't there. Just think about it. You don't want to spend years working and ignoring dating opportunities waiting for this guy to ask you to marry him.|`|nRIsTdfIaa	What Julie said... but use a pen.    "If you ignore it, it'll go away"... more true than you can imagine!
8McA6xqPaa	flattered, sounds like he likes you :)  If you like him then talk to him a little more often and see where it leads :)|`|gRZT4pnUaa	He is being nice he likes you. probably not trying to be creepy|`|65fTJrHJaa	That is so adorable of him, I'd be over the moon|`|AA10859079	If I liked him, I'd be flattered.
f3vcAOEYaa	forget her, if she just wants to go out with you because of a car  shes not worth it.    $200k by Friday?  probably not going to happen.  don't lie next time!(:|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Quit being so desperate. Find someone else to go out with.|`|ClK9W8THaa	Go to Payday.com|`|r1cDHOsHaa	LMFAO!!! thats soo funny, no offense but that just made my night!!!!  Tell her you left it in france for your vacation home.  HAHAHAHAHA =)|`|AQpt6m0Xaa	She probably already guessed that you don't have a ferrari because of your small intellect. She probably just wants to go out with you cause she had a good time talking with you. If you think that she just wants to go out with you because of the car then you shouldn't be going out with her in the first place. And don't lie to her again, cause then you run into problems like this one. and if you start anything with her she needs to be able to trust you|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Tell her the truth.
iTUugOTLaa	Ok, your problem has little to do with her. First off, thanks for your answer on my question. Second, I think you're a bit too worried here, maybe even insecure.    Look, first of all, don't be apologetic about wanting to have sex with her. We all want to have sex with a potential mate. I wanted to have sex with every girlfriend I've had, before I was their boyfriend. Any man who doesn't think that way.. well, i don't know what to say for him.    If she takes ANYTHING you do the wrong way, chances are, you're better off without her anyways. Unless you do something absolutely ridiculous; then it's really YOU who blew it. But that's ok too, you learn from your mistakes. You have to risk a bit to win a bit.    Personally, I'd just go up to her personally on a date and ask her.    For example, you're a bit anxious, do it by phone. Ask her on a date, Don't make it complicated, ask about her day, how she feels, and ask her about the date. In the date, ask her about the dance if you really want to and feel she's good enough.    cheers, good luck.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	She might take a wink the wrong way and look at it as if your trying to make a pass at sex with her.  Slip her a note the next time you pass her and ask her to the dance.  That is if you don't want to confront her face to face.|`|FH2KUed8aa	You need to make a bold move.  Just go for the gold, but be a gentelmen about it.  You can definitly win her over.|`|gjmQXU3Aaa	ask her to the dance! or dance with her but dont be a dick about it and be all full of your self or anything|`|L2RqeYedaa	Go for it!   Wink! That's subtle, and really cute.   Start practicing.. ready, go!|`|YtdRTjkNaa	Just go up to her and say" hey I was wondering would you like to go to the v-day dance with me" ? if she doesn't say what you want to her just say i'll see you there.     or if youre too shy to ask. when you see her just say hey and walk away. it sounds funny but if she is interested in you, she will come and ask you why you said hey and walked away. females dont like it when i guy does too much talking when he is trying to make a move. you basically have to say hardly anything. only the first time though.    hope i have helped|`|mbDp1IHuaa	stop her in the hallway & ask her if you can talk to her : )  be really sweet and ask her to the dance, & then if she says  yes at the dance you can ask her to dance. good luck.|`|lKS1CNhmaa	You can do it bro, just do it.! Valentines is the day for it!|`|j5cotsxzaa	I would just ask her out and tell her your feeling about her i bet she would be flatered|`|KNJjZJJOaa	wink at her, it is really cute, and yeah just go up to her and tell her that you have seen her around and talk to her and in a couple of days ask her if she wants to go to the dance with you, be bold,, dont beat around the bush about it , if you do and it doesnt work out in your favor, it is no ones fault but your own|`|kcNBEB8Haa	You should probably smile at her at the hall for a few seconds and then look back down. If she sees that you do then, you probably have a chance of getting to know her/ask her because she's ready for it. :)|`|6Wyg4mNyaa	You should tell her how you feel. (TRUST ME IM A GIRL) We sometimes get jealous and want the guy to make the first move because we dont want to humiliate ourselves. Talk to her first and get to know her. Become friends and ask her to the dance! She probably likes you too! Good Luck!|`|TebGjfjXaa	if you really like her talk to her be nice to her get to know her then ask her out.|`|p1JzkgDOaa	Whatever you do, be confident! Ask her to dance! If she dances with you, chances are that she's at least remotely interested.|`|0nl3zUBzaa	smile at her :) and say hi. good luck|`|1XcTZRemaa	I think that she does like you, as she was staring at you, and he friends were trying to get her to dance with you. :] What I'd suggest doing now is asking her to the dance, or just asking her to go to the movies or hangout - to get to know her better. If you hang out with her first, she'll have more of an idea that you want to ask her out, and you'll know each other better.     Good luck!|`|EMYImof1aa	hmmmmm you sure ask her to dance next time! wink at her, wave or nod your head at her in the hall way! make friends with her friends and you'll get to meet her! do it!!! it sounds like she'd into you=]|`|AA12088442	umhhh... ask her 2 the v-tines dance... yeh thats it i guess|`|a8560dffc68323babeca5570faca48b6aa	you should step up and make a move. ask her to dance or something.  the worst thing she can say is no.|`|a85YzdTZaa	well she shows a Sign that she likes you when she starred at you.    Now she expects you to come to her so just be straight up and first ask her to the dance?|`|6p50zivoaa	Hey.u should wink at her and flirt with her some.and u should ask her to dance with u.u guys should hang out more and get to know eachother better.just be confident.good luck!|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	what exactly do u want to do with her?|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	when you pass her in the hall way, wink at her, or smile or make eye contact, something to make her know you noticed her. if she responds well then at the dance just ask to dance, she will more then likely want to. she seems to like you ;)|`|u9ewvqJuaa	If YOU'VE noticed her behavior she's TOTALLY flirting with you. Men tend to be less intuitive about women's subtle advances (don't worry, it's not your fault, it's built into your genes). Be friendly with her up until the day of the dance: bump into her in the hallway and star chit-chatting (not literally of course but you get my meaning...), ask about her day, or complement her. Be obvious yet subtle. If she is open to your flirting and responds to it you'll know for sure that's she's definitely into you. Then you'll have more confidence to ask her to the dance or ask for a dance when you're there, or maybe on a date.    The worst she can say is no right?   Go for it! Good luck!|`|euHZPsQYaa	This is simple. Tell her you've noticed her, you think she's cute, and you want to know if she'd like to go out for dinner or ice skating, or something. Have an idea of where you want to go on the date, don't just say "something sometime."     Have a few dates in mind for the date as well. Like, Friday, Sunday, Tuesday. Start with Friday, and suggest a couple other dates if she says no to the first one. Use your instincts. If she sounds like she isn't interested. "No, sorry, I'm busy that day." and doesn't say much else, she probably isn't interested.|`|LbtU8iWAaa	hummmmm you have a tough situation here.... just do it! at the dance just say " hey there ( her name) would you like to the lucky girl to dance with me tonight?" it depends what kind of girl she is but thats what i would like to hear. if you have a good time at the dance then you can ask her out. im pretty sure that she wont be disgusted at a wink! if i knew you... i would like you! you sound sweet! sorry if im being wierd!                                 P.S. at the dance, bring her a red rose. just one. it works like a charm!|`|9WHtStZNaa	Okay, I'm going to make this as simple as possible, for time's sake:    1. Talk to her, get to know her. (girls love guys who feel like they are listening or paying attention)       -bring up that you like to dance!  2. Find a way to interact with her each day  3. When it gets closer to the dance, ask her if she is going.   4. At the dance, slowly start dancing in her direction w/ each song.  5. Ask her to dance.    Basically, if she responds to the first one well, you're all green lights ahead, trust me. :)

I had an ex once that left me for his ex because she was sexually active and i wasn't. he went with her for the night to have sex then tried to get back with me the next day. Just move on or stay single till you are older.|`|Ls1OQuz0aa	probly because u to didnt hang-out enough or to much, mayb u to didnt talk enough and had nothing in common, u never no, mayb he was just being stupid and reliz how much he just lost|`|bpuVHhKOaa	guys are kind of strange at times... always in and out of relasions. honestly he was probably too afraid of commitment or could be interested in someone else|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	I guess he was waiting for any kind of excuse to break up with you.

4EWCegiRaa	That's not an insult, that's him making sure you're ok.  Alot of women get very emotional after their first time, alot of women have alot of pain after the first time, and alot of women get attached to their first guy and need the constant reassurance that the guy still cares and didn't just sleep with her to sleep with her.    You should being seeing a gynochologist if you're sexually active anyway.  Alot can do wrong even if the guy did nothing wrong so it's safer and smarter to start going to make sure you're ok.    And give the guy some slack... I don't think it's a guilty conscience, I think he just cares.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	I think you have an unreasonably suspicious mind.    Your friend, being aware that it was the first time for you, is simply concerned about this.  Maybe it was his first time, too, so he may be anxious about the effects of his "intimacy" with you.    |`|xp8ZgVCjaa	Maybe he was asking all those questions because he is your friend and he knew it was your first time and he didn't want you to be in pain or hurt. Or maybe he's hoping you don't regret losing your virginity to him and doesn't want it to effect your friendship. Him showing he cares doesn't necessarily mean he's hiding something from you.|`|utCp7DTNaa	       Dats him being caring cz definately he knows its painfull for you. his just tryin to make you have no regret you lost your virginity to him. His your friend, don't br suprised if he comes to you askin you to be his gurl coz im sure he cherishes you for being a virgin while he met you. Since you have done all the tests nd they are all negative then i think he cares a big deal bout you..!!!|`|AA11155768	It sounds like he's concerned because of the way you are behaving. Obviously he's detected a change in your behavior since you had sex and from what you've written here, I would also be concerned. Please don't get involved with any sexual activity again until you've spoken to a responsible adult, nurse, or doctor. And yes, you should be looking into a gynecologist.

LnzUMUCdaa	talk to ur friend n tell her to lay the flirting off then talk to the girl u like n tell her how ur feeling
lNlL0Ag2aa	Well I had only one gf in my whole life and she broke up with me 2 years after dating. It was when I was 16 and I approached this girl older than me because I was scared that I will lose her if she got to college the next year. Well she said she loved to which excited me and made me love her even more, and the year later I always picked her up from college every day.     Things went great and I went to the same college the year after, but one day she asked, "Hey, just wondering if you ever though of having kids?" And I said "Never in my whole life." It made her quiet and it upset me considering how we typically flirt around and have fun, but I guess she was serious about it, she asked me drive her back home. Well the next day I got a text from her saying that she found another bf. That was last summer.     Go figure, now I'm going to ask if the girl wants kids before I ever ask anyone out, otherwise I'm just going to wait for them to ask me.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	I love my gf with the help of eyes and heart !! and you can't do this !!
c2aC15ZFaa	no, only he cheated on you.  you are not a cheater.|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	well yeah you could've told him not to cheat and break up with his girl friend|`|zo1lvjLlaa	no, that doesn't make you a cheater because you didn't do anything wrong. he cheated on her, which isn't your fault.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	no, it makes you the other woman.  unless you have a boyfriend too. then you're a cheater.|`|303ff0e87cb5c2fc2993c01f27608f90aa	you knew he was seeing someone else. that makes you as bad as him. attached ppl are out of bounds and ex's are ex's for a reason. you should never lower yourself and go back there.|`|VTw6E9gUaa	Well if you were doing stuff with him, and YOU were also dating someone I think that makes you you cheater.    But some people think its not cheating until you have sex.
SweWC8p1aa	You could talk about school, what she likes to do, or just joke with her... You could Ask her what she is doing.. Or just keep making new subjects up!!! :P dont ever be borin
lpeOwnGRaa	I'll tell you what happened to me, because I was just like you.    We'll call the guy I liked 'Bob'...    In school, whenever I saw Bob I would think, "How is it possible for anybody to be so flawless?" I could not find not one thing that was the wrong with him.    I would look at him and see just utter perfection. I would at myself and think "How is it that I have so many flaws, and he has none?"    It didn't see fair, you know, that he was so perfect and I was so far from it (or atleast that's what I thought at the time).     Then oneday, I was with one of my friends (Macy). And Macy just said "You know, he really isn't perfect. Look at him now," (he was walking by us), "What is so good looking about him? He's average, Violet. And his pants kinda droop, and says dumb things alot. He's not a total screw up, but he's nothing to write home about..."    And then it occured to me, that she was right, in someways. Obviously, I still liked him, but I realized that he really wasn't as perfect as I thought he was. He made mistakes too.    It's called 'looking through a rose colored glass.' That's what you're doing right now...    Just realize that he (like everybody else) does have flaws!!=) And that's okay. When you talk to him, just be yourself. Ask him about his family, if he has any pets, where he'd like to travel. And remember that he is far from perfect, even though he may seem that way to you. =)    God Bless  ~Violet
PYejFCyTaa	long distance relationships take alot of work and if your already doubting his intentions then i don't think your relationship stands a chance sorry just what i think
9Oxu5CIoaa	Just talk to her. Say you think the two of you would be better off as friends. And once you break it off, don't show any romantic interest in her. Just move on and make sure she is able to move on.    P.S. Good move, you are 15, I wouldn't get into a serious relationship at that age either.|`|t2jmVyfXaa	tell her the truth, girls respect honesty. and if you tell her how you really feel there is a good chance you will still be friends|`|XasLRQnXaa	tell her you're gay
20LnuCejaa	I know it's scary and you are worried about people talking.  However, it's good to get used to rejection.  So...be confident and ask him.  If he says no, it's his loss and don't you worry about that "word" going around.  If he says YES, you will be the winner.
wrvCzyAqaa	Tell her!!!  Some young people unfortunately don't have a clue of what's appropriate and what's not.  You are the adult.  If it were my daughter, I would expect you to tell her something like..."I'm flattered.  And I'm glad that you value our relationship. I care about you, but I am not in love with you. You are 13 and it would be very inappropriate for me to think of you as anything but a child and I am an adult.  Now let's study for your math test."  Ha Ha...just kidding about the math test part.  But seriously, teach her something.  Don't let it go and fester into a bad situation for her later.|`|BZg5TFlqaa	wow. tell her that she is justa hormonal teenager. and that shell fina a boy her own age. tell her that ud would go to jail if u did anything with her. wow 13 yrs old. sorry buddy. maybe u should stop seeing her or whtever...|`|w0pWqXsRaa	Even though she IS too young to really know what love is, if you don't want to be too harsh, don't say that. Because even though she's young... she doesn't have anything to compare this too and really thinks she's in love, and it would devastate her if you tell her it's not love. Tell her about her her good qualities, and that she'd make a wonderful girlfriend to someone someday, but it can't be to you because you're not comfortable with the age gap. (Not to mention it's illegal if you were to have sex). And you are both in totally different places in your lives (unless that is you still attend middle school and live with your parents). hope that helps :-)|`|3c8GsRvUaa	tell her wait till she 18 teen you will then be 39 by then so she wont want you.|`|QSodlfMraa	tell her *** no she is trying to send you to jail. she is 13 dude.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	don't say anything, she'll forget about it next week...

mR98pKtyaa	Wow. That would leave me rather breathless. Sounds like he was looking for a hooker while he was away on a business trip?    How is your relationship? Is the intimacy still there? Maybe he's craving attention you're not giving him? I think you definitely need to find a way to go about talking about this. I know it might be hard to bring up, seeing as you were invading his privacy by going through his e-mail. But it's out there now, and you're not going to be able to keep it a secret.     He's looking for something outside of the relationship, and that's just bad news.    Sorry to hear. I would be heartbroken if this ever happened to me.|`|k4TO7xY1aa	Definitely ask him.  This happened to me once only on his cell phone when my fiance was with all his friends on a ski trip to Tahoe.  I flat out asked him and made it known that I was upset.  It turned out that his friend called the Bunny Ranch unbeknownst to him because they all had Verizon and he had Tmobile which was the only one with a connection...it was a case of boys being boys.  I trust my man 100% though and after talking with him and looking him in the eyes (you can tell if a man is lying by looking him dead in the eyes) I know it was silly.  I do know however that it is a sinking feeling and eats you up inside.  Wait until he gets home, ask him flat out, look him in the eyes and never give him your source of info...it throws him off and freaks him out.  |`|AA11155768	You should definitely ask him and take note of his answer! Looking him 'dead in the eyes' isn't going to accomplish anything. People have been known to be able to pass lie detectors! How did you accidentally come across his email? I'm guessing you already had your suspicions. Marriages can survive infidelity but only if he is willing to admit his wrongdoing and stop cheating AND if you are willing to work towards forgiving him.    Also, you must be willing to look at yourself and make sure you are doing everything you should have been doing in the relationship. You won't ever forget the infidelity but you can forgive him and make your marriage work. Good luck and God bless!|`|OfH5oIOEaa	I defnitely would.  But be prepared for what you hear.

lDUndWyBaa	I had an indian girl friend and we both were a perfect match. We were inseperable for over 2 yrs. When I finally popped the question, she couldnt deal with her family and backed off. It rendered the whole hearty saga to null. She did want to marry me but she cited the same thing that she has to heed her parents wish.   It was hard to get over that coz I had invested all of myself into her, everything I had. It didnt work out!  It's gonna be almost an year now since than and guess what! I am fine, it wasnt just meant to happen. Whole world would tell u if it was "good or bad" and the debacle would go on but what difference it made for me? None. It didnt happen, life didnt stop.   Time fixes many paradigms of our life and it will your's as well.    My advice; let it go. You stay hooked up to it and it wont be anything but walking on shattered glass. Good Luck!|`|Ga9oCLavaa	leave him...he is not a man, he is a boy who wants to please his mommy and daddy, not his woman. Just quit talking to him and let him live life apart from you, maybe he will learn a lesson.    Arranged marriages were fine in the old days, but personally for me...I would never want the responsibility of choosing a life partner for a child.|`|AA11155768	I hate to say this but if he was from any other cultural background, I'd say be patient but you have to leave him alone. Please look for another job and stop spending time with him. Your relationship with him is going nowhere. You do not have a future with him. He is going to go through with the arranged marriage as is his custom and there is nothing you can do about it. To continue to pursue a relationship with you, he would have to be willing to cut all ties with his family and to never visit India again. I don't know how old you are but you should really take a break from relationships so you'll have time to heal.     Good luck and God bless!|`|MtL2fZjOaa	I think you should move on.  I know its hard, but if he really liked you and really wanted to be with you then he would.  Like marriage is a lifetime commitment, and I understand that he is Indian and the culture because I am Indian too, and my parents expect me to have an arranged marriage as well, but that's not gonna happen because I can't spend the rest of my life with someone I don't know. AND if I find true love i'm not going to give it up for anything.|`|jLrGAPbmaa	He has an obligation to his parents. This type of tradition is foreign to most of us growing up with the idea of free choice marriage and I find it a bit offensive when people ****-talk arranged marriages and I don't even have this expectation in my family!     Perhaps you and your boyfriend should discuss the possibility of staying together and gaining his parents approval. If you would be willing you could study up on Indian traditions and try to impress his parents in this way. Another thing is that you should suss out how much his parents are willing to take in his opinion about his future wife and how they would feel NOW about him marrying outside his culture.     (p.s. sari's are BEAUTIFUL to wear 
Tut0k2ZGaa	Take a shower once in awhile so you don't stick to people.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Some advice to you sir, is to date the new girl.  The ex seems like a complete b*tch.  She might also not be pregnant.  She might be using that against you, saying she is, when she really isn't to get you back.  You might want to have her show you a test right after she takes it.  Don't have sex with her until that point.  And odds are, if she is 17, and lost her virginity to you after 2 weeks of knowing each other, she most likely wasn't a virgin to begin with.  Sorry buddy.  Good luck.|`|MGC1NKnVaa	The first question that comes to my mind is, "How do you know she's actually pregnant?"  I mean, it COULD be a manipulative attempt at getting you to dump your new girlfriend and then her plan is to tell you she lost it or something after she knows you have dumped the new girl.  I know that sounds horrible, but it happens and you should do something to find out and not just take her word for it.  Tell her you want to go to the doctor with her or something like that.  If she dodges you going, I'd be suspicious and INSIST. If you are the father, you have every right.      If she is NOT pregnant, never talk to her again.    If she IS pregnant, you need to get your families involved and figure out what you are going to do.  You are just as responsible for this pregnancy as she is and you need to do your part.      Next time, use a condom, but I hope for your sake she isn't.              |`|CDwPLmTjaa	make sure thats your kid.if you dont want to be with her count on 18 yrs of child support.|`|AA11155768	There isn't much of a dilemma here. You said you USE to love your ex so why would you be with someone you no longer love. You do need to tell your current girlfriend that there is a possibility that your ex is pregnant with your child. No matter what you decide to do, you need to take responsibility for your child and be there during the pregnancy.     Also, you are only 19 and based on this question, you are not ready to be a husband. I think you should slow down in the relationship department and focus on finding a job and completing your education.    Good luck and God bless.|`|8WjIsgI6aa	okay tough! but if u really really like the new girl u should go for her because u like her, and besides u could always support ur unborn child and it was her fault that she dumped u when she had the chance to be with you but now all of a sudden she wants u back..idk if this helps but yea thats what i would do! lols|`|TZWGWAHdaa	go for the hot one...thats if theres a hot one|`|D8FlvN4oaa	The new girl. The old one left you once she will do it again. Take care of your child and leave her alone. stick with the new one sounds better.|`|02vCLJj0aa	The new girlfriend.Just get rid of your ex-girlfriend.|`|3AfmF13Yaa	you should stay with the new girlfriend because she did nothing for you to leave her. and you said that you really like her. and the other girl dumped you and is probably lying about the pregnancy. she is probably saying that just so you take her back.|`|tsJzEGtFaa	i think neither i don't think you should focus on girls just focus on your self you have your hole life in front on you. I think your ex sounds crazy so definitely not her and the military girl i think you should stay close friends maybe one day you guys will hook up again.|`|loyA325paa	make sure she's really pregnant ...  if not, then she can get an Emmy's award...  |`|wKClhBpeaa	well, make sure its your kid before you go  making any big decisions...  .  she could possibly be knocked up with  another guys child and is trying to pin it on  you... but i dont know her well enough to make  that judgment..  .  if its really your kid,, then you're screwed, the decision  is already made.. you have to go with the Ex...  .  if its not your kid,,, try out the new girl|`|gGJDAoFoaa	love and affection do not care the distance. if u really love ur EX....and i think u do..becoz she is carrying ur child.....then u should go back to her....and as ur present girlfriend is smarter, she may leave u when she will come to know abt ur EX. so, think b 4 u done.|`|ZyZY1PBHaa	ok dude i had something like this happen to me before but without the pregnant part lol .. ok heres the breakdown: The first girl u lost ur virginity to she left you and dumped you that just isnt right... that must mean you dont matter much to her.. if she would dump you once she would dump u again trust me..shes probably just coming back to get some simpathy and money $....Also this new girl sounds like a pretty nice catch ... just stick with the second girl... the first one lost her chance an ruined it.. She dosent deserve you =)      hope that helps.|`|6ByERt7faa	Tough question!    Take a deep breath in... Ok first of all I think you should stay with this new girl. If your ex hadn't told you she was pregnant would you really be considering getting back together with her? You broke up for a reason and remember she left YOU! (She only wants you back now because she doesn't know what the heck to do).     Stay in close contact with your ex and definately be there for her, but as far as a relationship stay clear. You don't want to raise a baby in a hostile environment, plus are you ready to move? Because I bet that is the next question that will arise.    Good luck and really think everything out. |`|PFE6pnPcaa	I would get a paternity test when the child is born.  It's probably yours, so you'll have to support the child for the next 20 years.  The good news is it'll probably be a really great kid, who'll love you forever and will be there to grow old with you your whole life.  So don't blow it by not spending time with him/her or denying it's yours or not paying support, etc.      As to the mother, you don't have to be with her.  You might want to try and make things work, but it you dont' want to then don't.  Be a good guy at least and help her with the pregnancy and delivery.  I would move to the same city, or have her move to your city so you can both raise the child as equally as possible.  It's both your child, not just hers.      As to your new girlfriend.  Be totally honest with her.  Tell her how you feel, and don't lie about your situation.  If you lie, then when she finds out the truth (and she will), and you'll lose her forever!!!  Just be upfront and keep her informed about what's going on.  If you do the right thing by the child she'll think you're a great guy and will respect you all the more.      Or, after thinking about things for a long time, you might want to consider adoption.  Just remember it's permanent and you may never get to have another child.  But do what's best for the baby and for it's life.  A two parent home is always best, but people can make it work in other situations.  Treat that child like you would want to be treated.  You have a lot of thinking to do.     I would also talk to you parents and hers.  Please just think things through about 5 times before you act on anything.      I wish you the best.|`|k5TfUzQwaa	Are you sure she's pregnant? Or is she just lying to get you back? Is she going to have the baby? How long have you known the new girl for?    I think you need to get a test to check that you are indeed the biological father, as your ex says. (That's if you are certain she is definitely pregnant)    Apart from that. I think it sounds like your heart is really set on the new girl. Don't go making any big decisions until you are absolutley sure. If this new girl is "new' and you haven't known her for that long, be careful you don't get caught up in the excitement and make a bad decision.     If I were you, I wouldn't be weighing up which girl is better or smarter, I'd be thinking about your unborn child and the implications it is going to have.    You need clarity. You need questions answered. Is your ex pregnant with YOUR baby, if at all? What are her plans for the future? Do you want to be there to see your child grow up? Do you both have support from parents or friends?    You need to forget about girls for the time being (trust me we're not an endangered species-  we'll still be around when you're ready for love again lol) and focus on this pregnancy business.      You need to sit down with your ex and have a big chat. Make it clear to both girls you need a break to sort everything out. Stay single for a while. Focus on the important things. Be HONEST no matter how hard it is.    Perhaps you and your ex should see your local pastor and have a chat?    Good luck buddy. I hope it all turns out. *Big bear hug*    
VG5nmdr1aa	sometimes things take awhile to get off..|`|AA11155768	Break ups are so hard to overcome! I'm glad you've recognized your depression but you still have a long way to go. It's ok to grieve over the relationship you once had but you should also work on pulling yourself out of it. Get a hobby or become a volunteer. Most importantly, let your friends know that real friends would not keep bringing you down with more news about him. You are no longer with him so let them know, you don't want to know what he's doing.     You'll feel better soon enough.

I was dating a guy while we went to different schools across the state. At times, he seemed like the sweetest guy....at other times, he made me hate myself because he could be such a jerk. He was constantly putting me down in subtle, destructive ways that ended up putting me into a depression. It was really hard to get over him when we finally broke up...and he got with another girl really fast too. Stupid me ended up getting back with him for a few weeks. Biggest mistake ever because I started to fall back into the depression he helped cause. I finally decided to cut him out of my life entirely and work on myself and my self esteem before starting another relationship. I got much better and ended up meeting the guy of my dreams....who I've been with for several years now.     My advice to you: work on yourself and wait for someone who deserves youuu. Also...don't ever think that you don't deserve a guy. You deserve to be happy and you deserve to be with whoever makes you happy. Things tend to work themselves out in the end.|`|nWiILEV6aa	I was him once.  I  have heard "you are too good for me".  I have had four different women all separated by time and many miles tell me I was too good for them. I had also been called a rare man by these 4 women.  I am that guy who brought flowers for you for no reason, maybe I got you a rubber ducky because you saw it in a shop and said "ohhh, I had one of those when I was a kid..." and surprise you with it a few weeks later, or perhaps I said "here is my heart, please treat it well" and held it as a gift cupped my hands in offering to you, or I stood up for you and made people apologize to you for being rude to you, and we made LOVE not just had sex (the real feeling of time stopping, the universe standing still and almost oneness) and after all of that soul sharing and laughter I am too good for them   The second one, Heather, also said that things were too hectic what with school and work and her family and me.. it was just too much and she would not open up and tell me anything.  I wanted nothing more than not to be a burden to her, more than anything else I wanted her to be happy.         As to why he changed: you probably broke his heart. He was hurt and needed someone to be there for him.  That is why he went to the other girl.  I'll bet he was crying his heart out on the other girl's shoulder and one thing led to another.  It happens, he is human.  Same as the "she is the one", it's called the rebound, all he is doing is superimposing a part of your relationship over the relationship he has with this "girl".  And if he really is such a man as I and you two really do love each other, tell him everything... I mean EVERYTHING (you know, everything that is making you sad) have it all out and if it is meant to be, forgiveness will follow and he will return to the man you knew.  I just wish that one of the women in my life had done what I'm suggesting for you to do.     Let him help you help you, it is scary, but nothing is worse than losing the love of your life to fear and depression. Just because you are depressed does not mean you hate yourself.  You might have real justifications for being sad. A majority of depression is normal and manageable.  I'll bet that he wanted nothing more than to be with you and help you in your time of depression.  Do you know why you are depressed?  MOST depression can be handled without the use of prescription drugs, but you need to figure out WHY you are depressed FIRST.  And few people can get to the root of their own problems and motivations alone.  |`|82GK2ficaa	Well Karen I have already told you my answer. :)  Anyways as I said..I feel that its good that you moved on and I agree with what one of the persons replied, its good to acknowlledge your depression...I know I have.  All I can say is that I know that you don't want to be his friend, and you have to take your time to forgive him for what he did..its not good to keep grudges because they affect you the most not the others.  And I know that you hardly talk to him but if you fogive in from the inside then you will have peace.  I dont like seeing oyu this way, you are one of my greatest friends, like a sister to me.  I hope that what I said really helps you a lot.  I Love you.  Maria.

CWgJ7Yyxaa	Your husband sounds like an immature and selfish man, one who has a lot of issues....and who likes to make you feel bad. This is not a healthy relationship at all.    We all make mistakes and bad choices when we are young. That is part of growing up and of learning. But he should be over your past and your past loves. What he is doing to you is abuse, so stop letting him treat you this way. You deserve better than this, and you know it.         Is What He Doing Abuse?    ? He gets you back if you complain about his behavior  ? He tells you that your complaints about his treatment of you are your problem  ? He gives apologies that are insincere or angry and demands that you accept them  ? He blames you for his behavior  ? Its never the right time, or the right way to bring things up  ? He undermines your life  ? He denied what he did  ? Anything he does that is hurtful or angry was because You made him do it  ? He touches you in anger or puts you in fear  ? He pushes you for sex or sexually assaults you  ? His behavior is a pattern    REMEMBER!    Abuse comes from attitudes and values, not feelings.    Abuse and respect are opposites.    Abusers know what they are doing, even if they dont appear to.    Abusers are unwilling, not unable to change.    They dont want to give up their power and control.    Some Types of Abusers    The Demanders    Its your job to do things for me, including taking care of my responsibilities if I drop the ball on them. If Im unhappy about any aspect of my life, whether it has anything to do with you or not, its your fault. You should not put demands on me at all. You should be grateful for whatever I decide to give, I am above criticism. I am a very loving and giving partner. Youre lucky to have me.    Mr. Right    You should be in awe of my intelligence and should look up to me intellectually. I know better than you do, even about whats best for you. Your opinions arent worth listening to or taking seriously. The fact that you sometimes disagree with me shows how sloppy your thinking is. When you disagree about anything with me, that's just you mistreating me. If I step on you long enough, eventually youll come around to my way of thinking.    The Water Torturer    You are crazy. You fly off the handle about the littlest thing. I can easily convince other people that you are the one with the problem. As long as I stay calm, nothing I do is abusive. I know exactly what buttons to push to get under your skin.    The Drill Instructor    I need to control your every move, or you will do it wrong. I know the exact way that everything should be done. You shouldnt have anything or anyone in your life except me. I love you more than anyone in the world, but you disgust me and dont deserve my love.    Mr. Sensitive    Im not a macho man, so I cant be an abuser. Nothing in the world is more important than my feelings. I know all your childhood traumas and fears so I can control you, and with enough psychobabble and double-talk no one will believe you if you say I am mistreating you. I can get inside your head, whether you want me there or not. Women should be grateful to me because Im not like those other men.    The Player    Women were put on this Earth to have sex with men, especially me. Women who like sex are whores, women who dont want to have sex with me are too uptight or frigid or lesbians. Its not my fault that I am irresistible. Im in this relationship if its convenient for me. If you would meet all my sexual needs I wouldnt have to run with other women.    The Victim    Everyone in my life has done me wrong, especially all the women in my life. Poor me. If you dont like what I am doing to you, youre just like the rest. Its okay for me to do whatever I want to do to you when I need to show you your mistake, and even if I go a little too far, to make sure you get the message. Ive had it hard, so Im not responsible for my actions.

He might get mad but oh well he shouldn't be acting like that towards you if it hurts your feelings.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	ditto what jmd said|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	This dude has serious self esteem and adequacy issues.
AA10471659	did you know that many divorced couples still have sex periodically when neither one are in a relationship? They at one time were best friends that fuc*** each other. And I have known some to say they are right back where they were when dating, only the sex is better. You either kick his *** and make him stop or kick his *** out. They know what to expect with their ex and it's safe because they know each other very well.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	What he is doing is totally inappropriate. It wold be one thing if he was still speaking with her about their kids (if they have any) but the  kind of things  he is saying are just a prelude to the next  step.|`|YcHVTH7Xaa	Well that is sad, either talk to him about it OPENLY- not by sneaking through his e-mails (he will just get mad) or leave him.  Because this could turn into cheating, and I would hate to see you in that situation. I would talk to him pronto, and tell him she goes or you go.    Good luck!|`|sqA6ilTeaa	THATS BULLSHIT! Excuse my language but that is complete bull!!! I'm sorry love but you need to get rid of him because all you will get is heartache and low selfesteem. |`|AA11155768	Your husband is a cheater. You need to confront him head on and find out if he's willing to work out the relationship with you or get a divorce. If you allow things to continue the way they are currently going, it'll only end up as heartbreak in the end.     God bless!|`|d45684901ae6e9940c5a396a62d5bb66aa	ok, look, i think most guys look at porn or check out other women or whatever. its up to you how seriously you take it. yes its with an ex so it is different than the stuff i mentioned fair enough but it may just be a little excitement for him and he has no intention of going near her.   however i don't want to take away from how hurt you must have felt reading this email, and it is hard to be faced with such a thing.    i am guessing you were sneaking through his emails? which is a bad sign in itself, it shows a lack of trust. i imagine you guys aren't very open or honest with each other about your thoughts and feelings, which may mean you aren't very close, which is a shame. there's alot going on here and if he doesn't respect your feelings enough to give away this bit of excitement in his life then maybe you need to evaluate the relationship, but do it with him, explain what you are asking him and why, and if he wont give it up he cares more about his excitement than your feelings. but that can be worked on and maybe counselling together would help you guys to be closer again. try not to base any decisions solely on your hurt and disappointment and be patient.   |`|6ea4gewSaa	What an @ss! Why are you even with him? I wouldn't trust him at all!  |`|OzREW683aa	I would send him an email saying that you want a divorce.....i would not ever put up with that.. he is emotinally chaeting and you  deserve better...............good luck|`|CQnlxYk4aa	Mann, what does that tell you? |`|iZbgUtxcaa	He thinks she is.    That is all that matters.    How is it REALLY being number two for your husband?      Sad that women stay in these relationships.  Women of the America, we are losing.
AA11155768	There's nothing wrong with you. I'm 30 and you sound a lot like me. I've always hung around with an older crowd and have never liked drinking, clubbing, or going to bars. It's called being unique. There are other ways to find people that you'll have more in common with. The internet is a good start. |`|AA12178046	dont worry, nothing is wrong wit you..i comprehend your confusion. You're just really mature. You think better than others do. I'm 18 and i feel like im 25.  I have always felt older than my actual age. My teacher told me thats actually good because people seem to take you more seriously and take you as a responsible person.|`|wQ5c6yAcaa	Nothing is wrong with you.    You just don't fit with people you know.    Try going out and doing things that you haven't tried before.  There are a lot of people your age that don't drink and don't like bars.    Guess what, you can't find them at a bar!  
AA11155768	You need to tell her exactly what you've just told us. There is nothing wrong with the way you are feeling unless you hide your true feelings from your gf. With patience and understanding, you could both have a great relationship and you good possibly fall in love with her sooner than you think.|`|sJt7nhnmaa	help me out here, so what your saying is that you like to spend time with her but dont want to spend the rest of your life with her? like just a really good friend? or what? |`|bVPGp35Gaa	tell her, not us.  |`|4eb4e591a329858b58021279d9bd810eaa	just enjoy the time you are spending together. of course people will hurt you. but still enjoy the time that you are spending together. it may not last forever but be optomistic about it and do not worry a bout the future. i learned that if you just have fun adn ejoy your relationship it will be very healthy and it will be a very fantabulous one! (yes i know i said fantabulous!) :D just tell her how you feel. if she loves you and cares bout you then she will be very understanding! :D just keep your head up! |`|0ea7bf6891ddbad7bcf85f5347c907e5aa	Come on....your a man...do what men do...lie to her...just tell her you love her .ya don't have to mean it .where ya been all this time?|`|6d4f85fffde512f0a21df339b98f8542aa	They say that the course of true love never runs smoothly.  It is difficult to meet that special person, it is not like going in to the shopping mall and picking one off the shelf.    What if you were to regard love more as a command than a feeling: would you be able to obey that command from your heart?    How do you get on with her family?  How does she get on with yours?  I do think it is a mistake to regard marriage as just us and wonderful.  In many ways it is a joining of two families, and you really have to look at the wider picture.    It is a big decision, and if you don't have doubts then you're not real.  Sometimes you just have to trust your gut instincts.  You do no one a favour if you live a lie.    Just give your self a bit of space and a bit of time to work it out.  If for example you get the post Christmas blues, well see how that pans out and then make your decision.    If you still can't make the decision after a crisis point then do a toss a coin trick.  Heads you marry her tails you don't.  Then however it lands you do just what you want to do.  Sounds crazy but it can work.  |`|JBugDqvraa	If you don't think you love her then you have to break up with her, why are you leading her on like this?   She obviously loves you very much and if this isn't returned then this relationship will always be one sided.  Why would you want to settle for someone you just "like" when you know you can be in love with someone and feel all those happy exciting real love emotions?   I know this is sad for your GF but you both deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them. Talk to her and tell her honestly how you are feeling|`|MldpKxQsaa	It sounds a lot like you are more afraid of her hurting you than you are of hurting her. You have what could be considered a troubled past when it comes to relationships and are afraid to commit in fear of being hurt again. I cannot tell you what to do, or what to say, but this is a discussion that you need to have with her. Let her know that you really car for her and want to make her happy. But that you need to make sure that your feelings are certain before you can move further. If she cares for you she will be patient, but you need to sit her down and have a serious discussion one on one. If you are forward and direct with your words and feelings it will sort itself out. Good Luck!
AA11155768	Tell him the truth about your feelings and be prepared for the friendship to come to an end. If you continue to be friends with him, it'll only hurt him more and cause a strain on your friendship. I've been in a similar situation before. My best guy friend was in love with me and I did not feel the same way. I told him several times that I had no feelings for him and he kept saying he still wanted to be friends. In the long run, he was still hoping my feelings would change and I ended up having to pull away. Good luck!|`|DhwOLpkZaa	You tell him the way you feel try not to let yourself feel bad about it or think your hurtting his feelings and if is any kind of friend of yours he would understand how you feel. but hide it cuz he might just think you like him more.so yes i think you should have a talk with your friend there.|`|AA11337288	Have your girlfriend tell him.  Just have her say... look, she LIKES you but she's in "IN LIKE" with you.    see how that flys....|`|TTDamAqHaa	I had a problem just like that but it was a little more serious. I told him that he needed to leave me alone cause he was starting to scare me it ruined our friend ship but i felt safe in the end.
AA11155768	First of all, you aren't ready for a relationship if your first thought after rejection is suicide. Please confide in a responsible adult about your feelings and lack of a social life. Secondly, talk to your friend. Let her know that you believe having sex is a bad idea and that you don't think he's right for her. You don't have to tell her that you are in love with her. 
t9jwJIrraa	He's only worth your time if he doesn't care about the color of your skin. Try being friends with him and see how that turns out.|`|QB3dXwsDaa	it dosent matter!  And if it does, he's racist so its a good thing your not with him if he is lol|`|AA11155768	It's sad that your first thought would be that he may not like you because of your color. Anyway, try striking up a conversation and pay attention to his body language. It never hurts to try.    Good luck!|`|l7hMhyvhaa	Go for it.. try ...    im a black girl and i have noticed black boys are more interestd in wyt gurls ANYWAY...    so start the talking.. then more convo then flirting :)    what can go rong|`|jDPULfjKaa	DOES HE FLIRT WITH YOU?    if yes then obviously he likes you, and the racial barrier is broken between you two.|`|tqEInVIJaa	what are you talking about all the blacks guys like white chicks now adays.|`|U7UjwzVTaa	I don't see the problem.  Ask him out.
4aRtiKO4aa	Hmm YES lol dork. But it depends what year she's in. and how much you do it. Make a little indside jokes with her. I love it when guys do that to me:)|`|WsNwBaGkaa	This depends on her. Some girls are used to teasing or kind of like it. Some girls are hurt or embarrased by it. Try listening to her verbal and non verbal reactions or ask one of her friends - a real friend, not someone that will say yes wen the girl really doenst like it.    Ultimately you are ten times more likely to get a lot farther with compliments than teasing. You might as well start practicing compliments at an early age. Get to it.  |`|cTrDK6xSaa	depends on what year she is|`|u0b2lJpxaa	it depends on how much u tease her and what u tease her about  because in some instances they wont like it.  but teasing is cute sometimes :]|`|LxfNVOTGaa	it's called flirting. as long as she knows your joking cause then you look like an a*s|`|U7UjwzVTaa	As long as your not offending her.  Teasing is a form of flirting so go for it!|`|l7hMhyvhaa	tbh, i used to gt teased by this guy that sed they lykd me in the end..    for the gurl its not nice at all..    try flirting in a nice way, make her feel warm n welcome, n shell lyk you too, but do not do the opposyt itll put her ryt off..    lmyt end up embarrasig u sum how infront ur frends.. remmeber what goes aronund comes arund|`|FfoSBnijaa	If she can tell you're kidding, deffiantly.

Also, don't make it anything mean or a prank.|`|AA11122479	just try being nice to her. teasing is not for high school dating. smile at her every time you see her. compliment her on little things.

You don't want to do anything that would hurt her feelings.|`|eZtdK8wMaa	Why not? Teasing is a way of flirting. 
AA11155768	Call your local Department of Family and Children services or Social Services. They can determine whether or not the boy is in a healthy environment and could possibly return him to you. You don't want to keep fighting with your family because it'll only make them keep him away from you more.     Good luck!
rN5Hhw81aa	You need to talk to child protective services, get a lawyer and have a parenting plan written up that states your wishes as far as the father's involvement with the children goes. A judge will have to approve the parenting plan, but it will be worth the hassle. Good luck, and seriously, these are the two things you need to do. If you don't, there is nothing that can be done. You have to be willing to go through the BS for the sake of your children. I'm sorry if that sounds a little harsh, but I've seen too many single mothers say that they are worried about the situation with thier exes, but don't do anything about it, and then bad things happen. |`|AA11206135	I have to ask if going for the child support is worth it for the hassle you'd have to go through.. And for what? If he's that big a loser you'd get what a hundred bucks a month? If I were in your situation, I'd move far far away and forget he existed. (mom of five..been there done that)|`|AA11155768	First, you should contact the police for a restraining order against the girlfriend and whatever proof you have available, show it to them. Secondly, you need to contact a lawyer and your local Department of Family and Children Services. He should be paying support already and you need to file for a divorce. You need to make sure DFCS is aware of the threats and drug use. You need to make sure that he is either not awarded any visitation or supervised visitation AND pays child support. Even if you don't need the money right now, he should still pay because you never know what will happen in the future. You may even be awarded a sum of money to break the lease.     Good luck and God bless!
vcjPx1WRaa	Stop being do desperate. It's Saturday night and she is probably out with friends. Get a grip. She'll call you when she is ready to|`|7iwMKK5vaa	txt her or call her in like another hour.|`|g9zsZ51Xaa	call her or text her|`|AA11155768	Stop waiting by the phone! It's unhealthy to sit and obsess over someone you just met at a party. Find something else to do. If you aren't available when she calls back, the voicemail will get it. If you don't hear from her by tomorrow, call her and see how she reacts. If she says she'll call you back again and doesn't, then she's not interested.
AA11155768	Wow, I'm really surprised at the answers here. Kudos for taking the keys and not giving them back. That was a very wise thing to do.     It is very possible to get so drunk that you have no idea what you are doing. Anyone who gets that drunk has a problem!! Don't forgive her yet! Let her know that she needs to talk to someone and/or tell your parents/guardian. If she doesn't talk to someone, you should do it for her. You can't make her change but at least you will have done your part.     Once she gets help and starts to improve her behavior, then I'd forgive her. No point in forgiving someone who's going to make the same mistakes over and over. Continuing her behavior sets her on the road to injury, jail, being raped, killing herself, and/or hurting or killing someone else in a car accident.     Good luck. |`|ocwetmQuaa	Sounds like she's pretty much on her way to becoming a drunk.  Accept the apology, but never another invitation to one of her parties.|`|k6ES7O41aa	u did any awesome job of hiddin her keys (not bin sacrcastic) she could have hurt some1 u should forgive evry1 gets drunk its (4 some ppl) and innocent mistake|`|yhJOMfFOaa	Yes you should forgive her alcohol makes you do some really dumb things. And it is possible to not remember things you do when you are to drunk. As for her and the boyfriend, that  has to be between them.  |`|LP14p56iaa	I think you should forgive her. But also try to explain to her how much she hurt you because she was so drunk. This might make her reconsider the consequences the next time she gets drunk. The next time she asks you to go to a party with her, ask if there's going to be alcohol. If there is, I'd advise you to not go; just for your safety. :)|`|ad559ef88f939f9d26d9af2103d73f95aa	 You can forgive her once,but if she does it again,it is up to you.   It is possible for people to get so drunk that they pass out or can't remember "last night".   You were right to hide the keys from her,how would you feel if you hadn't and she was involved in an accident?   As for her boyfriend,it is up to them to decide their future.  |`|K7xUJkr9aa	yes it is .  forgive her |`|OKZj02GDaa	Kiss and make up.|`|oLk6IoDeaa	Yeah its that possible.|`|5FCiKNaGaa	forgive her|`|Z6fZpnoOaa	dude, yea, she apologized to you its not tha big of a deal|`|nQxQj9gyaa	You should Forgive her. she was drunk, so what could she do?|`|AKogv4vOaa	Hey just forgive her shes ur sis stuff like that almost always happen i say yes!!|`|ysLsTHWraa	Yes forgive her.|`|VufsQyqtaa	NO! dont forgive her; or at least not yet.    You need to point out all the danger she puts everyone in by getting in a car while drunk.  And how much pressure it puts on your shoulders for having to hide the keys.  You are not her babysitter, you shouldn't have to watch her and tell her "No big sister. You are too drunk.  No getting in the car tonight. okayyy???" no, she should be the one setting a positive example.    Another pointer; are you aware of the dangers and threats that alcohol poses, not even counting drunk driving?  Liver and kidney diseases/failure?  She can DIE from overdosing on alcohol.      You NEED to talk to her about this.  Alcoholic is on the path she is taking.
P2LMUNqhaa	he probably is a quitter, what i mean is that when the going gets tough he gets going out of your life. he probably wants to be there and be a good dad but then reality sets in (for guys it is more scary)  and the only way he knows how to deal is to leave. but just some motherly advise it is going to be hard on your little one if he keeps doing this, when baby gets old enough to understand. my neices baby is almost 2 and you can really tell he misses his daddy who is very much in and out of his life. i would maybe suggest finding someone new who will be there for you through everything, i think that it is something really important esp when your trying to build a family. |`|DenLZAL1aa	He has two lives, one he lives with you, and the other, who knows. If he isn't cheating then he is a weak kneed child in a man's body, and  he runs when life gets hairy. Either way, do you and your baby a favor, and Kick this clown to the curb|`|rx0ekB9Paa	it sounds like maybe hes into u,but the fact that hes not responding and u didnt give him any kinda makes me think he was just filling ur head to get some and when u didnt,he left the picture. maybe he does like u and hes just not ready for a family.|`|5flmZ8kSaa	oh hun don't want him just becasue he's the baby's dad.  he sounds like a jerk and doesn't want to be locked down.  just let him go.  you need to do whats right for that baby.|`|veZLfnGFaa	This is not a good time for you to be going through all this alone. He shouldn't be doing you this way.  Apparently he isn't interested in you or the child because he has been gone for 2 days.  Besides, when you texted him today, you could have been telling him that you needed to go to the hospital and he didn't even call.  This man is not responsible enough to be a father.  You called him your bf, so there isn't a marriage here.  Please don't make the mistake of marrying him. Let him go on.  Concentrate on staying healthy the next two months and I hope you have a beautiful, healthy child.    Good luck |`|AA11155768	I know someone who's been through this many times over 5 years. I wish I knew how old you both were, education level, and employment status. There are several possibilities for his running away:    1. He's afraid of commitment.  2. He's scared of being a father.  3. He's found someone else.  4, He's a complete moron.     Sometimes as women, we have to be support systems for our men, even when we need support ourselves. Especially in this day and age when so many homes lack male role models. None of us can say for sure what's going on with him but I will say this, be careful with your heart. This is a very hard thing to go through and you'll need plenty of time to heal.     Don't waste your time arguing with him and certainly don't say anything that would degrade him. That would only push him further away and possible destroy any relationship he may have with your child. I certainly would not be sexually active with him and definitely not without the use of a condom. Right now, focus on your health and the health of your baby. Sitting by the phone awaiting a reply will only put more stress on you so seek support elsewhere and find something to keep you busy. If he calls, then good. If he doesn't, you won't feel let down because you weren't expecting him to call anyway.     Over time, you'll find it easier to pull away from him or he'll come back and stay. Only you can decide what's best for you.      Ok, this answer is long-winded enough so I'll stop here. I hope you have someone you can vent on.     Good luck and God bless!|`|pPqOtLy0aa	maybe he is just scared and confused, having a baby is scary business|`|6taNabssaa	He wants to see how easily you will take him back if his other "thing" falls through.  All he is doing is keeping you on the back burner, coming back long enough to stir you.      Next time he comes back tell him to take a hike.  Don't text.  He isn't worth the keystrokes.  You may be pregnant with his child but the three of you will never be a family.  Move on.  |`|uCKxbnPtaa	He's not ready to commit to becoming a family man, it sounds like.  I wish you luck, and I hope you find someone that truly wants to be a father.  :-)|`|HUvcQvQYaa	You didn't sleep with him? So that means the baby isn't his. Man he is an idiot for wanting to marry you and take care of someone else's kid.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	When a man absents himself mysteriously for days at a time, he's either got a drug problem or another women waiting somewhere.    Be very careful here. Wanting him to be a good husband is not going to make it happen.|`|29hcn9JRaa	 Many therapists and experts will tell you to always trust someones actions versus their words, and if you really stop and think about this you soon realize it to be true, as it isn't what this man says that is meaningful, it is what he does, or is doing that should determine if he indeed has all your best interest at heart, so what action is he taking that may lead you to believe that he is a man of his words? What has he done, not said that really proves to you that he wants you back? Im guessing that he might be the kinda guy who can talk the talk real well, but what you must see prior to reconciliation is, can he walk the walk? Trust his actions, not his words.
AA11155768	You really sound as if you have an addiction or fetish. This is something you should seek professional support for because things may not be so bad now but they aren't going to get better on their own. Think of it like an alcoholic. When they take that first drink, they don't imagine that in 5 or 10 years time they'll be out of a job, living on the street, or no longer with their families.    Good luck!|`|NuvKPl3naa	i would get out of that. i really think that lowers your pride and self esteem. maybe try dating sights, or do you have any female friends to hand with. being you are wanting to wait 2 years that is really not a long time. maybe start looking now. date and have fun. then when the time is right you may have someone spend your life with. blessings to you|`|rx0ekB9Paa	instead of going to the escort site,why not go to a dating site where u might meet a girl u can actually sleep with? that way u can have a relationship. |`|a466297f03e64cbb400e3f633d36482caa	Definitely not normal but not too weird for me either. I'd advise you to see a therapist and get a professional opinion on this.|`|4d639c64877709bbe2a9f82ba4b212f9aa	First of all, you are a normal guy. I understand how frustrating it is to be doing something you are not totally at peace with yourself about. One of the things you mention is that you cannot think about marriage for a couple of more years.  That does not mean that you cannot think about dating.  There are a lot of girls who do not want to have intimate relations until marriage.  It would be a good and healthier thing to do, if you asked some nice girls out for dinner and a movie.  You would then be learning about socializing and will be more comfortable being with girls whose interests  are similar to yours. Having any sort of contact with "escorts" is simply a paying relationship. You are payig someone to do your bidding.  There is no friendship, intimacy, or connection.  You sound as though you are feeling guilty about it, so I think you are probably doing some damage to your emotions.  Do you consider yourself to be of the same moral and social class as the women who sell themselves to strangers?   Ask a nice girl out and enjoy conversations, dancing, having fun experiences, learning about each other  and hold off on the paid sexual contacts. I would not want to have anything to do with a boy who paid someone to do anything to him.  By the way, did you know that prostitution is against the law. Our town has had a lot of "Stings" which must be very embarrassing to say the least.  And I for one, believe  it is always best to obey the law.  Lots of luck to you in your learning  about women and hopefully about yourself too.
ltfq1vMdaa	even though he hasnt done anything wrong, you've changed and thats a reason in itself! id say its perfectly reasonable to want more, and go ahead|`|jCWAYgaMaa	Tell him that your time together was great, but you need something else now. Tell him you want to go ahead and end it so you don't feel like you're leading him on. |`|Aq0QQnxeaa	I think you should end the relationship. I can really understand the whole intellectual aspect and I think it is a justifiable reason. Good communication is important in a relationship, what will you have to talk about when you are old and have nothing but time to talk? Plus the more time you spend the harder it will be to leave because you will feel like you have invested so much time into the relationship(which maybe you already do) but at least its only 3 years and not 7|`|Q5HJfJFZaa	People mature and move on. That's what dating is for. You connect, you grow, you find someone that makes you happy. And if it doesn't work, you move on.   When the newness of love wears off, when the sex is not 4 times a day, when all you have is each other - what do you have? Conversation.   Breaking up sucks, but so do being in a relationship that doesn't fulfill you. Do what's best for you.|`|AA11155768	Stimulating conversation can be such a turn on!! I love it, too and I have also been in relationships with men who couldn't keep up with the conversation.     That being said, that's a hard call. You don't want to be hasty in your decision because you could end up worse off then you are now. I guess what comes to mind is some of the ideas from Tyler Perry's movie (not play) "Why Did I get Married?":     They speak of the 80/20 rule where a man or woman leaves a relationship because they are missing a piece of a relationship that they've found in someone else only to find the person they were with had 80% of all the qualities it takes to make them happy and the person they left for only has 20%. This could be true if you believe that it's not possible to find 100% of what you are looking for in another person.     Also, in the movie, the wives find themselves questioning whether or not they should continue their marriages and are told to make a list of Pros and Cons. If the Pros outweigh the Cons, stay in the relationship and vice versa.    I'm sure you can find a lot of great things about your current beau or else you would not have been with him 3 years. How long have you known the new guy? Have you ever tried inviting your bf into activities that interest you to get him involved in something new? Have you done the same with him?    Good luck!|`|7PbIfBmoaa	Tell him that he has been too non-intellectual and that turn you off.  In a way, tell him that he is stupid and ignorant and is no way to match up.  Straight talk is good and honest.  Everything is not fine as far as he is concern.  You are growing up and and he is not.  Let him stay where he is. You move on.|`|ThcQK4zCaa	Let him know you need some time apart to meet others. Just tell him the truth but gently.|`|sOgdAiEmaa	i guess its time to break up  but he seems like he rly loves you cuz yu lasted so long    maybe you should talk to him to get him to have serious conversationsw w/ you..?    or let him down gently|`|433fc7134c3c5f138604a40e8f21e680aa	One thing you're going to find when you're in school is that people grow and change. And not to generalize, but this is a common characteristic many females find when dealing with guys. You're right, you're not the same person you were and you're going to find this more and more as you grow into your 20s and 30s.    Maybe you and your boyfriend need a heart-to-heart talk. Besides, you're probably about to graduate high school and go off to college where you're going to find a whole new source of people to learn and grow with. As much as I hate saying these words (because everyone says them to me),    You're young and it is time to explore and have fun.    If you and your boyfriend are meant to be, you'll come back together and fulfill whatever calling you both have. Until then, follow your heart.    Good luck!|`|9qqbY1gZaa	he hasn't done anything but you have changed and that's reason enough to break up.  Just tell him that you have changed and it's not working anymore.
7fc862488fd8bbc01863aaa40926effdaa	Talk to him about.  If hes a real man, hes listen.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	if hes your friend...talk to him about it maturely...    if you can be mature and he cannot...its probably not right...and if he can give you a straight answer...than you will know...      good luck...it might be worth a try|`|AA11155768	With your trust issues and everything going on in his life, I say it's time to let it go. If it's meant to be, it will be but for now, you really need to focus on school and overcoming your trust issues. It's quite possible you aren't ready for a serious relationship in which case, you should really focus more on school, hobbies, and friends.     Good luck!|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	It sounds like right now you are very confused and have so many other problems in your life that it might be best to take a breather from dating. You seem like you get easily confused by physical affection and accuse the guy of using you even when you don't really believe that to be the case. There are a lot of underlying issues to this, and I think you should talk your problems over with your school guidance counselor, a spiritual advisor, or an adult you really trust.  When you have your life sorted out you can work on finding guys to date. But remember, you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't rush into relationships you're not ready to have and lose the time to figure out who you are in the process.  Good luck.|`|xPBEOSz2aa	Girl... who needs all that drama. Their are plenty of fish in the sea move on with your life. Their will be another guy right behind him. |`|j5LBlIAKaa	just talk to him and let him know how you feel|`|uXYkVDj5aa	Well, honestly I don't think you should date anyone unless you get over your insecurities. It seems like if you two date then you'll just keep feeling in your head that he's using you. I would definitely keep talking to him if I were you and maybe flirt with him if you can handle it, but I don't think you two should be in a relationship.|`|zLwCv0uiaa	He , is one of the most typical type of S hole on earth gal. while you being insecure is sheer silliness on your part, but that's not entirely your fault since you've been hurt a lot before, just gotta learn to deal with it girl! :D    small fights are cool , but keep them resolved.  saying he's CONFUSED bout his feelings for ANOTHER girl right one day after getting more touchy & saying he wasn't intending to use you is just brutally disrespectful towards you to begin with babe. Weren't ya supposed to be the only one that he's got special feelings for before you guys get together? An obvious playa .    A week after & all that sounds like no more than an excuse to me, no offense intended!    & as his ex-gf & you can't even tell if he's got feelings for ya (since he's flirting all over), i suggest this guy be dumped out of your life.    good luck! =)
ZOLlLQtUaa	reverse 411 on the internet.  google it.  it lets you type in the number and gives you the info on who it belongs to.  usually works for me but if not,  get some guy to call posing as your boyfriend and get info out of her|`|dGuKnWNgaa	confront him! it may be nothing but since he is hiding the number.  or you could invite this girl out to a place where you and your bf are both gonna be, from his phone..|`|Wc6pEOeZaa	well, you definitely shouldn't invade his privacy like that first of all. that's some intense trust issues there. if you admit that you did that, he'll probably break up with you because that's really messed up. i say just drop it and stop doing stuff like that. he probably has a perfectly good reason for it. unless you don't trust him because he used to be a cheater or something then that's a whole different story.|`|AA11155768	Women are born with this wonderful thing called intuition. If you feel as if he's cheating, chances are, he is. Don't call the girl to get more details from her, she probably doesn't know about you. Confront your boyfriend. Tell him what you know. Hopefully your intuition will tell you whether he's lying or not and what to do next.    Good luck!|`|C2tXHHBNaa	You can't ask him about this, because he'll ask about why you were going through his stuff. It's incriminating for both of you... You especially, if he did nothing wrong.    If you think he's cheating on you, look for other signs. If everything else leads you to suspect that he's cheating, *then* bring it up. |`|UVciAbXxaa	tell ur bf ask him who is she is have him man up an answer you cause yes what u did was wrong but still u want to know so if he has nothing to hide he tell you.|`|55I4L8yJaa	Ask him. However, if you don't trust him you probably won't believe anything he says and it'd be best to just move on.|`|BvsZE6vUaa	Call and you shall find out.  Cheaters cheat on everyone, so this other person may not even know anything about you.  You may not be the only harmed party.  Cheaters are liars, so if you catch him, get rid of him.  He'll do his again, and again, and again.|`|BnjFbaygaa	plain and simple,    if he is cheating on you, you dont want to beat around the bush, just ask him straight out in a nice way, see what he says    or just approach him really angrily and ask him WHO THE HELL IS MELANIE!!! and wait for his reaction    either way you have to ask him, good luck =]|`|jWBuMxKzaa	maybe his cousin got a sex change?  |`|0FxsiVHnaa	just ask him...make it  nonchalant . just i dunno grab his phone or something while he is with you...he shouldnt care. and ask why he has his cousin in there twice. you should know by how he answers the question.|`|nNzWWNVdaa	Have your boyfriend mood changed since you have been going out? And if you live with him, Does he go out some times and dont get home till late late?|`|OsRcc7Nwaa	My rule of thumb is to never accuse anyone of anything unless you have true facts behind them. I know how this is because someone very close to me went through someth|`|1NHzFpHNaa	well if you use a reverse phone number look up   http://www.whitepages.com/reverse_phone    it may tell you her last name.    However ultimately I think you are prolly going to have to ask him about it to find out the truth. I don't think you should call the girl and start asking her questions because she may not know anything about the situation.     So what I would do is just be honest and tell him what happened. Say I noticed two numbers with similar name, why the different area code, ect. and explain that you are just curious and not trying to invade his privacy or accuse him of anything.     Then you can see how he reacts and check his story later if you think it is suspicious or he is lying.     Just try not to sound like you are accusing him of anything.|`|8RUK5mgbaa	If your only proof that he is cheating on you is that he has a girl's nickname in his contacts, then that's not really proof at all. Yes, of course he could be cheating but you don't really have any proof. They could just be friends with a funny history or he might be friends with her brother. For all you know she could be 9 years old and he babysits her. Don't go paranoid--there's no proof for sure.|`|jD0nfrIBaa	As much as you may not want to, ask him.  Tell him you were messing around with his phone and saw this guy was in here twice.  And then you saw one of the numbers had the local area code.  See what he says.  If he brushes it off, then fess up about calling the number.  If he acts weird at all...well, then I'd say he's cheating.  Call the chick up and ask.  Sounds fishy to me.    I wouldn't stalk them or anything, just ask.  You may get the wrong idea if you try to figure it out yourself.    Good luck.    And if he IS cheating...leave his a.ss!  |`|aLDZzWHPaa	well call th number, or get a friend to, say that your a friend of - insert  your boyfriends name here  , and u want to speak to fat frankie, he ddnt answer on the other number so you tried this one ( wink wink nudge nudge) -  now u can see if she ses " who's franky?" or " oh here he is " etc  try and get information out of her, and be careful, cos she myt no your boyfriend is cheating on his girl, so may cover for him , so dnt let em know who you are, unless it helps with the problem  |`|AA10223583	Okay I can understand your concern but is it possible that  Melanie is the cousins girlfriend?    Maybe you can get your friend's brother to call her and flirt with her to see what he can find out. If she ask how he got her number tell him to tell her from a friend. But never say who the friend is. That way if your boyfriend comes to you with this it might tell you something.    I hope it's just a misunderstanding and it turns out she's really a friend or your bf cousin's gf    It's sucks knowing or thinking your mate is sneaking around and you can't really do anything about it    But make sure you get all your facts together before you do anything.    Good Luck
N9wUzvJ0aa	I think that no matter what you should forgive her and not hold anger against her.  I would give her another try.  If she hurts you again and you feel that you can't emotionally handle being her friend, tell her that you forgive her, but can't handle the pain anymore.      No matter what, you're better off forgiving her whether you can hang out with her or not.  |`|1dNZb7Y4aa	well...u could do that, or you can just continue to let it be.  honestly hun, what you need to do is figure out your options.  it SOUNDS like you and this girl werent a good pair. and it ALSO seems like this girl LOVES drama.  a girl that LOVES drama will continue to LOVE drama until shes old enuff to realize its dumb, which isnt in her right now.  what you need to do is let this friendship be, id say that you need to stop being the bigger person and have this girl really learn her lesson.  make her think before she becomes friends with n e one else.  i suggest you stay away from her, she seems like nothing but trouble.  it sounds like if you get back to being friends, drama will splurr up before you know it.  good luck|`|uA1s3keBaa	Forgive and see where it goes, maybe she's had a life-altering experience.    If things go the same, or start to look like it, warn her.  If she doesn't straighten out, do what must be done..|`|AA11155768	That's a very hard call to make. Some people can apologize and make it seem sincere without ever changing. Some people are open to change.     Ultimately, the decision is yours but when I've found myself in this situation in the past, I found it best to just let the friendship go once and for all.     Good luck!|`|TbENA08baa	If she is sincere, only time will tell...but you should at least give her that time to prove it since you two have been so close in the past.   Forgiving will make you feel better too.|`|AhsYqSUMaa	Forgive, if the apology is sincere. That doesn't mean you have to hang out with her though.
AA11155768	I've attracted men of all shapes, sizes, and heights and I'm 'curvy'. |`|AX0hvk6taa	i think it's more than chemistry..  hmm.. more like gravity or bio-magnetic things|`|KvwVBzb0aa	I was always told it was to even out the human species and make a future of all same size humans. Sounded good to me.|`|I6YPgPNeaa	umm. i wasn't aware of this...    im a thin guy and i dont necessarily prefer curvy women    and think you just made this up right now. |`|9QWmy13Daa	What do you mean lean men do you mean those full grown men who weigh like 110? Or the guys like me with no fat but weigh 230?|`|fB6TMyAlaa	umm that is not true, everyone has someone they are more attracted to and its not if they are thin they like a curvy person they just who they fall for. thy emight not fall for the outside but for the personality|`|hJCeiMadaa	well you cant have two thin people in a relationship|`|VTPNnfqXaa	i'm curvy and i like curvy girls.I'm fine with any girl as long as she isnt a *****.|`|jviZY6kxaa	No clue. Irony?  i don't know, but it works for me. Im thin :P|`|XKoYg5Whaa	some guys say    the more cusion for the pushin    yea i know it's corny  
AA11155768	Let her know right away and gently that you aren't interested in her. If possible, wait a while before you express any interest in her friend.     Good luck! |`|8U1aivfwaa	just use her for sex then|`|yWFsab6laa	just tell her as nice as you can that you dont like her the way that she likes you, and just try to not get her mad so that she doesnt mind you being with her friend, and it might also be a good idea to become her friend so that she lets you go out with her friend more likely.|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	don't get involved with either of them. you could end up breaking up friends if you do. this has happened to me, i  like a guy, a guy likes my friend. she did hook up with one, but i forgave her and now we just laugh at how shitty the guys are i like when they im her all hey lets get together. she sends me the convos and we just laugh.|`|3WSQdcG7aa	Be as polite as possible. Then tell her, when your not around her friend by the way..
IPDuAMWpaa	He's definetely the one cheating on you. I'm in a long-distance relationship now too,but once you trust the other person you don't think that they're with somebody else. People who cheat,especially guys,get more conscious of the fact that if they can get away with it,why shouldn't you?     Either that,or he's just really paranoid and insecure. Sometimes,but not very often,a guy might think that his girlfriend is just to good for him and get jealous of other men who are better looking,more educated and such. Even if he's just jealous though,he should trust you. Love is basically built on trust,no sense in making a relationship where you can't even believe in eachother.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Tell him you can't trust him based on his behavior, and you think it is time for a 'break' to think things over....drive him crazy...  |`|VBdXray0aa	No, he sounds always suspicious and possessive.  Watch out with this one.  Be careful, people like this never change and the more they get involed with you, the worse it will get.   I have been there - do not get too involved    PS     Your profile is the absolute sweetest !!!|`|xIkHbC3Maa	could be, just sounds to me like he's insecure. long dist relationships are SO hard(been there) and the main thing you need in them is trust and communication. reassure him that hes the only man in your life and that you arent going anywhere. a missed call doesnt mean youre out there messing around.|`|ldzDqqUcaa	just tell him your not|`|AA11903378	It's one of two things...he's completely insecure, or he's cheating on you.  All you can do is assure him your not and if he doesn't believe you and starts to get too overbearing about it, then forget him, because they don't change.|`|vyRcpz7Maa	long distance relationships are very difficult. Just look at the members of the armed forces.    trust is a 2 way street.   jealousy will kill a relationship faster than anything else.   Either get it together or get out of it. |`|Xb1EkhGcaa	he's clearly paranoid...may think you're too good for him...or making too much of small signals.    long distance relationships are near impossible for this reason.    if you really love him try and fly to him and give him a good time to reassure him, but really if he doesn't trust you than he doesn't love you.|`|MOALoKWdaa	been there and yes he's the one thats doing the cheating and long distance relationships don't work. i've been in one for a year and a half and yet it didn't work out since he kept asking if i'm cheating and got tired of it. so do yourself a favor and get out of it while you can....|`|QcW2eXnOaa	no, i don't think he is cheating on you.   Nowadays guys don't trust women like in the old days.Many women(obviously not every woman) are way to easy these days, that's why he is worried.  Although he shouldn't be since you are not cheating on him.|`|irFsdhtyaa	he might be guilty but I don't think that's the reason he probably just hates not being around you.  I am also in a long distance relationship and I get to move in with him in January but right now he does the same thing saying that I am with my other boyfriend but he told me that he says that because he wants to be there when I get home from work or when I go to the store.  Your boyfriend believes you he is probably just jealous that other people get to see you everyday instead of him. |`|UVyeG9wqaa	With my personal experience when you give no reason for someone to believe your cheating on them but they constantly accuse you of it, it does usually mean they are the ones with the guilty conscience. They think things like,   Well if Im doing it she has to be.....    Ask him if he is and if he gets mad or laughs,   those are also bad signs.... And trust me, I know what Im talking about.|`|QUu5fTPAaa	i have had this problem a lot do you hang out with guys alot? and also guys worry just as much as a girl does when i am with not with my gf i think what is she dooing who is she with is she cheating and in the end i know the truth that shes not i trust her with all my heart i love her and you should tell him look if you dont trust me then you dont love me or want to be with me so stop saying i have a nother boy friend and just stop you guys might have to break up for a little while just so he gets his head on right |`|6WbC4jO7aa	Honestly that could be the problem. Some guys accuse when they feel guilty about their own infidelity. The other explanation is he is just insecure about himself and needs a little extra attention. Either way i would try to talk to him about it and see what you can find out cause you don't wanna keep putting in so much effort on someone if they don't respect you enough to tell it to you straight...hope this helps.|`|j2nShupaaa	yup ur right hes probably cheating|`|OfiMrMr8aa	maybe you should answer the phone when he calls|`|fm39D2Omaa	Could be he has a guilty conscience. But since your in a long distance relationship no one really knows. I'd have a long nice talk with him about it.|`|d21b8a886cea9e7687d2a1f509f75f80aa	Usually when anyone in a reltionship is cheating they usually accuse the innocent party of doing so!!!|`|LMUs6P8Yaa	Long distant relationships are hard i mean even relationships that are always together are hard. It might be that he does have a guilty conscience but also he has trust issues.|`|oDVLJAqUaa	he night not be cheating but he might be really insecure...or he could be because they say a guilty conscience does that...i would tell him look either get it 2g and know that im with just you or we may have to end this....|`|NUYbtT8Maa	He is clearly insecure in the relationship. Its his problem and he needs to deal with it. 
2be8CGUUaa	what i do is, (i know this sounds silly)    drop your pencil infront of him or something and let him get it for you  and see if he talks to you .    Also maybe try to talk to him yourself, say "Hey i dont really understand what the teacher meant did you"    &thats how you guys will get to know each other(:    *Warning* Do not make yourself seem weird, be precaucious, for instance dont try to impress him too hard. .|`|379833cdc0fd6cb60406f36faec52d3aaa	do what ur heart desires...you can do it!!!  xoxoxoxo  email me if u have questions  jspakrs@yahoo.com|`|38a75cb352d3271b8056e667f3af73d3aa	Men/guys love to feel like they can be of assistance to you.  So, if you want to connect, ask him a question....    You say he is smart, so ask him a question about what it is that you are studying.  Or if you know any special interests or hobbies that he may have and you are not familiar with it, ask him, **example** "so, you are really big with hockey, I have always wanted to do that!"    There is nothing wrong with being shy...just "start a conversation" with him, only, let him know he is "helping" you by doing so...    and let go from there.    Hope that helps.|`|AA10668187	Just go up and talk your in class talk about the work or ask for help even if you don't need it or offer help anything. It doesn't matter what you talk about just talk you get a conversation going then just let it flow, but starting up is the hard part|`|xJdKiwFmaa	Simply follow these rules and improvise as needed:    -Say hi to him when you see him daily.    -If you happen to overhear a conversation politely let him know you overheard him, and join in on it, with opinions of your own and ever so often reciprocating the subject back to him.    -DO NOT, i repeat, *NOT* force yourself into his life. You'll get whatever lifestyle or love you want in life if you don't stress it too much.|`|kdGO5J3Aaa	well dear......  this reminds me of my days.....you say that while talking to him you both feel shy...so i would say this might be love.......so you better aproach him because he might be feeling the same but he might be aftraid to say his feeling to you .......so take ur time think whether you really love him or not and if you really love him.... you better say it to him before any other girl does that.......never make the mistake of not saying your love to him........be quick and express your feelings................best of luck.......hope your love works|`|wsZ0YtiNaa	When you catch each others' eye, smile and wave. Eventually you'll get comfortable enough to say more than a few words, and it'll work it's way up from there.    Also, see if you can find his Myspace or anything, talk to him through that. It makes for neat convos the next day. =]|`|XglHtSx0aa	Just walk up to him and start a casual conversation. Act like he is already your best friend.|`|afNGvd9Laa	What that person said is really mean!

Sorry thats all i got :)|`|hI9wh6dUaa	u should try to think of something you both have in common.....like sports, religion, food, class, etc....or just give him a complement..guys love getting complements...just talk, im sure he will love to talk to you...most indian people are nice|`|MzXOJPxRaa	idk, well just walk and observe what he is doing and try find a common interest or like my sister is saying ask him for help on geo or whatever, just find a way to break the ice before the ice breaks in ur head and u drownd.|`|lzi26Ityaa	Ur friends r right  Say "Hi I'm sure you get this all the time but "  every time you see him greet him   try to strt conversations|`|VCqJm3tRaa	if your shy try to find a mutual friend and get them to invite you both somewhere or just try to come out of your shell and approach him the worst that can happen is him saying no its better to take a chance and get turned down than do nothing and wonder what if|`|AA10850971	well, in class or something, ask him about a question or something, tell you need help on a question, or in biology, ask if you had homework in geometry, just keep asking him little questions , and soon you might start having longer conversatoins|`|W0dQRarYaa	I can tell by reading your Q ur ugly...so stay away from him you gargoil|`|1HJ4MRAJaa	Print this question out and pass it to him in class.

XEcoJnt4aa	Honesty is the best policy. Be gentle. Good Luck!|`|AA10878426	you should tell her in private that you think she is a nice girl, but you do not think that the two of you work well together as a couple. Ask her if it would be ok if the two of year were just friends.|`|Ld16o3kYaa	just be honest.. either way she is going to be heart broken for a little bit. You want to be friends but it is best you give each other space for a while.. it is not your fault and im sure she would appreciate your honesty.. let her know it was never your intention to hurt her.
jVOapeKVaa	I have been asking this question for years. I completely agree with you. I honestly think I can handle it. As a matter of fact I think there should be competitions as to who has the hottest wives. I think Hugh Hefner has already won that. Anyway I just wish society would see that its ok and I wish that ALL WOMEN would want to do it, or at least consider it an option. That would also solve the whole "cheating spouse" problem.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	You'd be the one hurting in long run.....I mean really....do you think you can afford to have more than one wife?  Cause most men can't!!!|`|8ipxhmNTaa	In the end, it always hurts the women and children, and it hurts the men who can't find wives.     There are not a lot more men than women. If one man takes 5 women, 4 other men have to go without a wife, family, children.    A lot of cultures have poverty, no civil rights, and even slavery. If you look at the list, you will see those cultures generally overlap with polygamy.    There is a reason that NO free democratic country allows polygamy. It is an economy buster. It only thrives where women have no civil rights and can't work, own property or get educated. No self-supporting, self-respecting woman will agree to be some old goat's sixth wife.    No one cares who you sleep with except those to whom you pledge your fidelity. Your society cares a lot how you structure your family.|`|0Id85yiYaa	it's illegal|`|0hR5hMquaa	The only way they can do it in other cultures is if they give each wife equal everything. They have to give them equal love and affection and have to spend equal time with them. They also have to be able to support them all and their children.     I could never be married to a man who had more than one wife because I could never share the man I loved. But some cases a man and woman have been married for a long time and when they get older they have a friend who was widowed and doesn't have any way of supporting herself so the man's wife will even ask him to marry the widow.  There are many reasons why. Not just because they can.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Who is it hurting? You apparently. Try moving to a country that allows it.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I suppose that would work for some people but not me.  One woman in my life is hassle enough.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	No man deserves to deal with more than one woman's PMS. If you think you can handle more, you are sadly mistaken.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	You are obvious single.  Ask a married man and see if he wants more wives. They may want more girl-friend, but definitely just one wife.  Once you married, you will know why.  Muhahahaha!|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Okay, well if I get involved in something like this, then THEY are doing the windows and dusting!|`|579efbdfc8611a99d747d03112644e63aa	How about her having a bunch of husbands?

K9kKgrtUaa	I think it works out very well if the family has a head, and the head of our family is my husband. Every ship, every team, needs a captain, a leader. We discuss things and come to a decision together. He can have the last word if he needs it. But if he had to decide something for the best of our family I would do as he decided because I trust him with everything, with my heart and my life and I know he will always do the best for our family.    So, yes, I do obey him, but it's not demeaning at all, it's not like master slave. It's a mutual partnership where he shows me great dignity, honor and respect by listening to my knowledge,opinions and feelings and always takes them into consideration. In fact we usually decide to go my way as I am a good thinker and planning. But there are areas where I will choose to go my own way if it violates my principles.
fQYU96euaa	I would just go out and buy him a really good steak dinner or whatever his favorite meal is, then take him home and have a nice intimate evening.|`|rcut6bhoaa	What Msimmons said ^^^^^^|`|bV7yfxpKaa	Book a romantic weekend at a nice hotel.  Preferable one with a jacuzzi in the room and bring bubble bath.  Pre-order a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne for the room and a single rose.  Pre-order dinner to be delivered to the room at a predetermined time.  Make it romantic and all about the two of you for the one night.  It will be a birthday to remember.  Make sure nobody knows where to find you.

N8TIPTDfaa	i'll try to be blunt    Small: below 5"   Medium:  6-7 (5" can be considered medium too)   Large: 8+     I prefer medium;  it's not as painful.     I suspect that as women age, since they become loser due to the muscles relaxing, they would prefer larger.    Btw, i think that girth would be more important than length..  mostly all of the nerves are on the outside of a vagina,   and reaching only the first inch inside of it.|`|YTnM6TZSaa	Size does not matter all the time, when you are in a relationship sex is going to be spectacular no matter the size. but if not, seven inches is about average. also size also depends not only length but width as well. and aside from that you must know how to work it.|`|91ACjB5eaa	Lol what is with you guys?  i like um big...small...medium, they all do the same thing!!! jeez|`|gRZT4pnUaa	i think anything below 5 is to small. 7-8 is good. I have had 10 and it kinda hurt.|`|AA10774810	I'm sorry I can't answer the first question.  I've never really taken a ruler to any of them.  I can say this, however.  Size usually matters.  Note that I said "usually"; there are a few exceptions to the rule.    I prefer larger in scale.  As I've gotten older, the size preference has pretty much stayed the same.  Everyone is different though; not all snatches are made equal.  :o)|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	For me personally, it's more about the girth than the length. I'm currently receiving 8 inches (by that I don't mean as I type) and that seems ideal to me, having had bigger and smaller in the past.
21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	This same thing happened to me with a doctor that I met that I thought was such a great catch that I should give him a chance even though he wasn't over his ex and he wanted to date me. Basically, I can tell you: big mistake. He was completely screwed up in the head, was not over his ex, was not able to give me the proper attention I deserved and was a big waste of time. I would not date this guy. My experience was JUST like this and I put in too much of myself waiting around and eventually realized it was not going to work and was severely heartbroken. Total waste of my time and effort.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	try not to get to any further emotionally involved with him, no sex, and just enjoy time spent with each other sometimes people do need help to get over a past love, more so when the break up was maybe because she moved away or she ended the relationship. tell him you understand and want to continue to be his friend, and try to show him that you can be trusted with his feeling, be kind and caring, he seems to be a great catch if you can ever get him to care for you as he did his ex. I think her move has a lot to do with their break up because you stated she is mad about you, so she is telling him she still loves him or something.|`|WiGHLdNWaa	hes using to try to get over hes x duhh!!!! he still has feeling for hes ex|`|SmFVG8eXaa	You should probably not date him right now. He needs to get his feelings sorted out and if he doesn't, you'll most likely end up the one who's hurt.  He cannot devote the time you deserve if he's still thinking about her.  It's not fair to you.  Give him time to get over it.|`|UwsbuHZYaa	Three years is a long time to hold a torch.  Think about this-If you were to get married would you ever really believe that you weren't his second choice instead of his first choice?  Sometimes its better to be honest with yourself and cut before it gets too painful.|`|jChbnuafaa	dont pressure him just give him time if you pressure him hen maybe he might not like you anymore    just let him come over and cuddle or whatever after a while he will forget about his ex and think of only you     just give it some time   he has obvoiusly forgoten about his ex before because he had a realationship for 8 months so he just needs some time before going into another realatiionship
11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	that is a blanket statement and not true. trust me, i live in los angeles, it isn't always that way.    but there are gender identified relationships where one girl is butch and the other girl is fem. i assume you are referring to the woman who is somewhat male in her physical appearance.|`|kHizNOPEaa	LOL!!!

h2vIOmDgaa	Impossible to tell with just one incident but maybe regular sex is now boring to him.

That's what threesomes do to couples.|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	way to $lut it up. he has no respect for you now.|`|4LYasBGXaa	depends-    quite frankly you made the error of having a friend of yours involved.    you are not a slut, anyone who says you are is a base moron and deserves to be shot in the face with a 12 gague.  they need to step into this century and put away thier "knickers" and stop doing the jitterbug.    there are issues with threesomes and they CAN ruin a realtionship-    it depends on the relationship and all the people in the threesome need to be clear to the limits and boundaries beforehand.    the first mistake is using a friend- who picked her, him or you?    if it was him, maybe there was an ulterior motive for it and it was not the threesome, but the fact that he wanted to bone your girlfriend because of it.    i would talk to him about it- ask him his feelings and discuss it-    the main thing in a threesome is you MUST communicate.  do so-    see how the sex is next time- for all you know, he could have had a headache.    seriously- if you are in a relationship- there is a RESPONSIBLE way to have one, and an IRRESPONSIBLE WAY- and it must be done for the right reasons (not so he can just bone your friend) and with the right boundaries set based upon comfort level and right understandings-    sounds like you just rushed into things without proper preparation and understandings- as such it is very possible you have created a bad situation in your relationship-    ALSO- you want to make sure the guy/girl you are dating is of the right mindset- if he is going to use it against you because he harbors some kind of homophobia (i can't see how any straigth male would not find his girlfriend getting it on with another girl extremely hot) then you should weed that boyfriend/girlfriend out as a person you would have a threesome with.    most men are going to be uncomfortable with a guy friend banging you if it was a MMF threesome so you will probably have issues here and might have to chose between your male friend's friendship- and this relationship.     if you were going to do that you should have DEFINATELY have not used a close friend.    also 7 months was probably way too soon.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	I do not know enough about your relationship to comment on it other than to provide some generic insight. My first question is what do you mean he 'made no effort'? If you have sex then he had to have made some effort?     Second question is how much discussing did you have about the threesome? Did one of you push the idea?  Where there any discussions regarding having the threesome? Any discussions regarding how your relationship would function after having the threesome?    Third question is this a friends with benefit relationship? Meaning is your relationship is more about sex and friendship than establishing anything permanent?     Fourth you state both of you are busy. Do the both of you have careers that take allot of time and are only to meet when your schedules allow it?    Fifth question where there any discussions about the threesome after it ended? Meaning did the both of you take the time to talk about what went well, what went bad, and any feelings that it may have left you with?    Reading your posting I am left to if a part of the issue may be career related. If the two of you only see each other about once a week due to schedules I suspect there is a possibility that he may be under pressure from his job of if he is in school then school.     Another issue I am left to consider is the amount to communication that occurs between the two of you. If you see each other once a week to you talk to each other during the time or do you look at your schedules then decide when it is appropriate to meet?     Third issue is the length of your relationship. Seven months may seem like a long time for you but when you are talking the length a couple should be together before having a threesome threesome it is quite a new relationship.     Fourth issue if this is a friends with benefits type of relationship it may be that the two of you are at a crossroads. Usually this happens when one person wants to continue with the status quo and the other person wants to make it more of a permanent relationship.     In my opinion comes down to one of two issues it is either a communication problem or there was a relationship issue prior to the two of you having a threesome. If I knew a bit more about your relationship I might be able to give you more insight.
Rq3KgTxMaa	Just do it man. I ll give you a tip. Touch her while you are talking otherwise nothing will happen, you can have my word on that. And don't TRY to convince him, SHOW him that you are the man and you can get whatever you want. By your writing style, i can tell that you are gonna go a long way.

bm1mVGRHaa	i can tell you from experience that long distance relationships can be good and bad. You really have to be able to trust that person. I dated a guy for 7 months that lived far away from me.. but we recently broke up because of the distance.. and we never got to see each other. so i mean, they can be really great. But then again they can be not so great.

But sorry to say this, when you hear a 14 yrs old.....it's like you are going out with a little girl that is ready to grow-up. Being 14 years old is too early to go out or lose her virginity.

But three years is a pretty big difference in High School.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Right now, yes.  Think back 3 years to what you were like at 14 and how much you've changed since then.

UtrgRjTeaa	It sounds like he likes you, but more for the fact that you touch his muscles and are getting hung up on him. In other words, it sounds like he only likes you for the attention you give him. And now he knows that he can play with your emotions and make you wonder about him.    I would steer clear of this guy. He's shallow and he's a manipulator, and he doesn't like you for you.

AuKKjaxaaa	Your lacking sex life is a reflection of your day to day life with him.  I don't think you will feel passionate in bed with him until you find a reason to be passionate about him as a person.    You should find ways to spend time doing things with your man, and I don't mean watching television.  Go for walks.  Play a sport like tennis, or something simple like badmitten, catching a baseball, or tossing a frisbee.    You need to be friends again before you can be lovers.    As far as sex, you may try warming yourself up while he's in the shower, or wearing a blindfold to heighten anticipation and arousal for both parties.  Lots of sexual tips I could suggest but frankly it is more about liking each other.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	You need to take control and communicate with your husband on how your feeling before you either cheat or leave your marriage ive been married 10 yrs and you have to rekindle what you once had that was once so passionate. when a couple has been married for a while things tend to get routine you both need to put more passion into it tell him you need some hot and heavy making out and maybe try being more spontaneous with him that way its not so routine. Good luck ive been there

These are oil that dissolve and you can feel your skin slide and stuff). We layed in the tub together for a bit, then I started to get a little "hands on" and things progressed and yeah. He loved the way the oil felt and how our bodies were sliding together, and the water made it interesting.    It was the perfect amount of romance and a great way to mix things up. Now when we talk he mentions me buying those for when he comes home so we can have some fun.|`|6RXSS3fFaa	Don't be too embarassed to play games. For example, tell him you'd like him to watch you shower, but NO TOUCHING until after you'r done and then get really sexy with the way you wash EVERYWHERE. Or try role playing. Or what about having him blindfold you and touch you all over?  I think most guys, though, don't need anything fancy. They just want to see YOU get into it. A lot of women don't figure this out until they're in their 30's so heed my advice here. Let yourself feel the sensations and let yor moans escape. Get into it with your hips. Don't worry about what he wants, but focus on you and what you are feeling and let your body react. That will turn a guy on more than anything.  P.S. No! Don't fellate your man "roughly"!|`|jQpZnzQ1aa	lol awwwwwwwww ok well guys like reverse cow girl. they like when you take control and get all aggressive with them. talk dirty and moan really loud and tell him how good he makes you feel but more dirtier, im just censoring for here lol. they love head so maybe do it rougly and fast and make noise as you do it, like slurp noises lol. these are things i hear from guys. umm good luck! sorry if you knew this stuff already!
8vDAT7c5aa	No she wouldn't be arrested. It's not a crime at all it's all a part of life. Things like that happen in the Philippines all the time. No one is perfect.|`|DOdFTsigaa	I don't really know their official laws but I doubt that would be considered important enough for them to take their time to go to the United States, investigate, find her and arrest her. Too much money wasted for them to arrest 1 woman.    I'm Filipina btw and congrats with your baby! I hope you 3 grow into a happy family.
XcxL6ZMqaa	no, i dont. in the end, (if youve already told her not to do this) she will relize you were right and she was wrong! but, right now, that doesnt matter as much. you need to focus on communication. telling her how you feel and trying to find another guy she can hang out w/ that will keep him off her mind or something. i get where your friend is at tho, i was thinking the ecxact same thing but sometimes you gotta listen to your friends (my friend talked to me about it). tell her what you REALLY think! i hope i helped and if i didnt i hope someone did. bye.:)|`|m2rkfyTTaa	NOOO she probably should not have even went out with him in the first place if he had already been with you, that nasty, but going back out with hims makes her look easy and like his little b**** that he can just call upon anytime he wants whenever and for whatever, all the while she is getting embarrassed when people know that the two are"dating" and he is all around town with a skank, if you two are really friends TELL her aggressively that she need not o that again, or at least be there when her world comes crashing down, cause that is really what friends are for.|`|zDozNYhNaa	I think you should keep advicing her but if she still insist on dating the guy,then you got to let her be. Maybe she really like him and i believe she can change this guy for good. Maybe you should also advice her on that too.|`|dByIPgJXaa	If she really loves him then she is doing the right thing. But if her feelings aren't that strong then it's just kinda desperate.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	Well depends the guy he is! I mean what did he lie to her about? I honestly think that, well she must ReAlLy like him|`|rtucR0Vhaa	I don't know, its really about what your friend thinks of him. She can decide who she can date, not you.|`|W1aYIF71aa	Yes I do.  Your friend isn't very hot, she needs to take  what she can get.
Mg5JKObKaa	Just ignore her. Don't pay attention to her. If you know deep in your little heart that you didn't cheat, then it shouldn't bother you at all. Okay? And I'm sure you are not ugly. Eveybody is beautiful in their own way so she's just lying to herself and to others when she makes fun of you. She has issues. Don't let her get to you. You're better than that :) If it's REALLY bothering you, tell your parents or a teacher or the prinicipal and that should make her calm down.|`|W1aYIF71aa	Don't cheat.  And don't forget to ask a question.
fwYKjQVqaa	Just tell everyone that the situation is still new to you. You moved in with your boyfriend and soon there will be a baby in the picture. Its going to be stressful already trying to get used to being a mother and pretty much a wife. You do not need an extra person to clean up after and make things more complicated.|`|aXYiOskmaa	they can't force you to take him in. stop them at the door.  let your folks take him in if they're so worried about him.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	It's your parents problem not yours! They just want to pawn him off on someone else so they don't have to deal with him. Hes their son so they can take care of their problem. Your having a baby and got your own life going on. Not your job to look after and support your older brother.  Your making a big mistake who knows he might cause problems and break you and your bf up and who knows what else. If he is already moving some stuff in your place then right now it's a little late to be saying I don't want you to move in your already letting him. So I am not to sure why your asking this sounds like you already make up your mind your letting him move in so what's done is done.|`|DLTT0Svjaa	oh ****, he yo older brother? kick his *** out. put your foot down!!! momma|`|QZQj7V4laa	why should you play mum to your brother.  your gonna be a mum for real soon and its difficult enough getting into a routine and building your family..  its your home and your should be able to be comfortable and relaxed there afterall your paying for it...   tell him to get his own place|`|VMY7No0eaa	yea tell your family wants to help them so much THEN THEY SHOULD HELP HIM... not you who are just starting out.    He needs to get his own life in order... not at your expense  BE MEAN... that is what you have to do to have your own life.    take his stuff and take it to the parents house...or put it out one the curb and say NOT IN MY HOUSE!   And who cares if someone doesn't like him he sounds like a free loader and a jerk.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Tell him to get out, and leave you alone. You don't want two children around the place. The lazy gobshite.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	tell your family if you are so wanting him to live with me why not he live with you for a few months and see how he does
ZjM0ghSnaa	arrest her!     lol jk. I can totally relate, and i can see that happening to me! I always get my things stolen, my coach bag/wallet, my louis viutton, perfume, calculator. it happens alot. I would tell her parents and check the lost in found just in case. (like thats gonna do anything lol) but just try it. maybe you can take something important of hers, and then when she questions you about it, just smile and say "i dont know what your talking about". torment her until she gives it back, that *****! lol or, if you really want to embarass her, in front of everyone or your friends, just explain how she steals from you and everyone (out loud) and talk about how she's so cheap too. She'll be angry, and she would feel the guilt right then and there!     If you dont get it back, than im sorry. people dont derserve that and its unfair. But just know, that since she steals all the time (a bad sin) one day she will get something very important to her, stolen. Action reaction. and just know to trust people who you truly know, and dont lend ANYTHING to ANYONE.      Best of Luck!:)|`|1hciyvKdaa	If you have the box, it will have the serial number and other numbers there, write them down, give a copy of the paper to the people at the boys and girls club and let them deal with it. Worry more about yourself and not about outsmarting and embarrassing. It makes you look bad.|`|LHh7WX2Maa	dont go to the b n g club. i got money stolen from me by some chick last year.|`|nTpOBRusaa	I'd go straight to her house, confront her and tell her parents.|`|DLBX8CBRaa	Idk say your uncle is a cop and they have a video of her leaving with the ipod so if she doesnt give it back they will charge her for theft. that will scare her.|`|a9Cb4NyXaa	You could always act like it has some type of tracking device your parents put on it and that they are asking apple to tack it. If the girls not that smart then this could work.    Or    You could tell the people that work at your Boys and Girls Club since the staff saw her leaving with it. They should be able to get it back.  If that doesnt work have you parents call her parents. That way she gets grounded in the process    Good Luck!
0ehkP9qMaa	"Will you go out with me?"    Easy|`|AA10455206	Well I guess you could really ask him out yourself, or wait and see if he will ask you.  Don't worry and wait on him.  He will come around.|`|AeOMHUwFaa	(Response is directed to and only to "kawaii". Sorry if I offend you in your presence, to whoever is asking this, but I have a bone to pick with this hawaii person.     "Because your a big cry baby"    Ok, you going to talk down to her so rudely like you did me?     Look, you insult people anonymously, and what was with you calling me a big cry baby? Do you know ME? Would you want me to answer one of your important mind boggling inqueries? Do you know that women I "complained" about? Want to tell me why you picked sides and went with her??? Is it because im a guy? I don't count right, idiot?     In other words, don't be so quick to judge people and put them down, particularly when you don't know them. Your snide, inane response was all I needed to know that are a silly, misguided, jaded little whore.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	"Wanna go out?"    i mean, you're makeing a much bigger deal about this|`|Wet77WBXaa	go up to him and tell him that you guys should hang out!|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	invite him to the movies just you two and then tell him|`|ATb5iWoXaa	"Would you like to go out?" WOw how easy is that? Its supposed to be the other way around, guys are supposed to chase girls.|`|ywCjyB1kaa	I think you should just be yourself and act calm around him dont stutter and if he likes you at all he will say yes.    Good Luck|`|XuXl7MFoaa	jUSt AsK Him OR sHow UP at hIS hOuSE aNd SURPriSE Him And Go On a HoT Dayte|`|oKEkKhd4aa	Asking someone to be your boyfriend may be coming on too strong.  What you need to do is playfully flirt with him, and do it more and more each day.  After you guys are really flirtatious, ask him if he likes you, and then maybe he'll say he does, and then maybe he'll ask you out, so you won't have to go through that scary question.
qg6Dntq5aa	Just say that you have moral principles, also, that you feel something special for him, but do not look good, he has not done that you feel comfortable. If you want a serious relationship, he must understand that, and if all goes well, it could represent the love that is slowly uniting your hearts. Be smart girl.|`|aJfdmm2vaa	You were both drunk and we know what guys are like when they are blotto.  To me, I wouldn't say anything as you both might feel embarrassed about it.|`|aQ8EK9hraa	being drunk is no excuse for anything really  you knew what was happening if you really had a problem with it   you should have stopped him way earlier. if you dont want it to happen again then just politely let him know that although it was "fun" you would prefer to keep things the way they were.
xBd96wvRaa	It means please stop and talk to me.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	she is soo intrested in u, the smile and the eyecontact are dead give aways.. try sparking up a conversation with her, she seems friendly.|`|wvLn8JReaa	make the move ask her out...she want u to do it|`|6HNdZqnGaa	dont lose somthing good|`|0T5dWejcaa	She likeS you lol i do that w/ the guy i like...he StopS & giveS me a Super tite hug(Sooo makeS my day) we talk alittle be4 the bell riNgS:DDu Should do that
7yrdcqY1aa	go down on her or make her feel like she can be masculine... for example let her hold you... or tie her up and do a strip tease... or stuff like that. im just referring back to guy girl sex and putting your girlfriend in the guys position so hopefully that helps :)|`|y3xu4wxUaa	ew
nKKi1hANaa	the friend is in love with you. he didn't want you to go out with the other guy. now the question is DO YOU LIKE HIM?
1vZ1n0agaa	indians are shy!  this sounds like what i do with a guy i like because im not sure if he likes me    i just dont get the part where she knows you like her and doesnt return it, maybe she thought it was just a rumor  if i were you, i'd just ask her directly, then you'll get a solid answer at least|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Doesnt sound to me like she is interested at all.|`|mpB2agPBaa	you should just probably just ask her if she does... even though its not a good answer, its the best choice, so u dont just assume that she does like you and get it all wrong...|`|mvaPdekPaa	Werll maybe she doesnt say hi to u bc ur talking to ur friends at the time and doesnt want to butt in. And maybe work is the only thing thts a real topic tht can keep a convo going right now. Just invite her into one of ur convos with ur friends, and if they dont no her introduce them. She just sounds shy, thts all. good luck hope it works out! :)|`|HWojJn0qaa	Hmm maybe she likes you but doesn't want to have a relationship with someone that she works with so she is trying to keep her distance.|`|mHZvOhsDaa	well most of those are... negative man :(    sorry dude, but what you said there sounds like a no, maybe shes shy tho? i dont know why dont you just try confront her in person. ask her to get a coffee or something... if you sense her thinking negatively throw it in as "strictly business" so she wont feel pressured adn you will get to spend time, if things dont go well during the coffee maybe you should rethink it all.    hope ihelped.|`|XuXl7MFoaa	it should be woman, not women|`|cfCtMsnzaa	sounds to me like she is not sure of herself or what she wants|`|XJGp4AxHaa	Her idea of flirty and courting might be completely different than yours. I would say that it is fine. You guys just need to find some common ground.|`|adc2f928ad5c1e7ed865593e8e9aa8f1aa	Ask her for coffee- Then you will know if she likes you or not. If she declines, you will not look stupid since it was not a date you were asking her for.    Good luck|`|Cvq1gueNaa	ok, us women like to flirt. a lot. she's just trying to get your attention. she wants you to want her real real bad. just ask her out! if you're really positive that she likes you then it will go very smoothly. she's just playing hard to get. maybe you should try flirting a bit and THEN ask her out.|`|HJqPsZo8aa	How do you know she likes you if she never bothered to return your interest, and doesn't have conversations with you when it is not work related? I'm not trying to be harsh, although i'm sure thats how i come off but i don't understand. But if you are sure she likes you then you should confront her,ask her out on a date face to face :)|`|v5zWzdmwaa	30+ and still in college?  erm, well what are you thinking? how old are you? go for her, approach her if your about her age or older. If you are younger, then aim younger|`|wvLn8JReaa	yo i would have to guess she is married and she want no liking stuff... maybe if you go hard there are chances that she will end up in ur bed....  if she is not married u have try hard and must have patience thats wat they like...|`|mVgLfNAraa	I think she is trying to be professional.  Dating at work can be a bad idea.  However, you should approach her yourself and tell her your interest.  Then you will know for sure.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	i dont think she is interested|`|Jnz7yiZtaa	if she DOES like you, she is trying to hide it.  if not, she has a pretty bad attitude|`|Amnjqfk0aa	How are you sure she likes you? I think she is just trying to be nice and make conversation and be friends.    but honestly telling a friend to tell her, teenagerish (like me)|`|nDMa64oeaa	well sounds to me that she isn't interested!! sorry|`|iypgppEMaa	I agree with Flare! Dating colleagues has got bad news written all over it. Dont get me wrong, sometimes it works out real good but more often than not it spells trouble!|`|UvJ9mPlZaa	Just ask her out for a drink and put yourself out of your misery!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Give the woman a break, she's probably just shy and cautious.|`|sc4jNqjTaa	ok i honestly don't think that she's interested. the only reason she looks at you might be because she thinks your ugly or you have some of your lunch stuck in your teeth(no offense)
dalNxu8zaa	i would think about it alot and if it didnt happen i would ask him wat his dream date would be or wat is one thing that he really wanted to do with me that he has not done yet...|`|fk3TFlTlaa	I think that if I found something like this, I would be incredibly happy.    Incredibly happy to find someone who actually cares, and even took the time to make some scheme to make me even more happy. I would be so happy because it was the thought that counted really.      Well maybe something came up? Are you really going to hold a grudge against him for TRYING to make a lavish plan to make you happy? Things come up sometimes. What I am saying is that this great big plan was to make you happy with some romantic surprise right? I know it may be disappointing that it did not happen but at least you know he has the motives to maybe do something like this in the future.
vMFKIc4Jaa	LOL Married men take their WIVES on vacation. Mistresses only go away on business trips so they have some fun while they aren't in meetings. LOL|`|6wzQhsIkaa	If you spend all your time comparing your relationships, you will be miserable.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I would think that maybe his ex paid for the trips, maybe she made more money.      Or maybe he's been so to many places with her, that he doesn't want to go with you, because it will remind him of her?|`|8F33NnyYaa	maybe the ex wife organized the trips and paid for them,|`|3yNh5jO8aa	maybe he wants to forget her and vacations remind him of her. don't compare your relationships. he may have had to take her on trips to keep her content. talk to him about it, but don't "confront him".|`|ibJIXDOHaa	Sit him down and tell him how much you want to spend time with him and ask if you could plan a weekend trip.|`|NGKwsawdaa	well maybe the situation back then was different. maybe he had more money before and he could afford vacations. with how the economy is going on now, people are scared to use their money on vacations.He's probably afraid to use the money just in case he might get laid off. that's just my thought on it.|`|AA10211580	can he afford to go on vacations? it wasn't stated in your post. alot of people like me and my family can't afford to go on vacation often. usually i initiate the vacations with my spouse. he has never asked me lets go somewhere. it's always me. it doesn't bother me that he never initiates it.  if your boyfriend treats you well, respects you, is faithful to you, then I wouldn't sweat it.
zX01mIZnaa	aw dont worry about it :) she likes you and you like her so thats great :) ! maybe for now you two could be together without the title and commitment of being boyfriend and girlfriend, so you still like eachother, and you're together in a way but you just dont have the title. it might make it easier for her to talk to you, thinking that you're her friend and more but for now just not bf and gf. im sure this is going to work out great for you :) just give her time |`|3wFt9fyZaa	stop asking her out....she will wonder why doesnt he ask me out anymore.  dont be a nice guy and a shoulder to cry on.  sorry but girls dont like nice guys....|`|M3CsxF2jaa	Nothing you can do until she changes her mind|`|CDBRXtnLaa	just say its gonna be fine that your friendship is gonna go another level thats the point of having friends! friends turn into your date and turn into your gf/bf then turn into your fiance then to your wife/husband|`|37U0P66naa	she might not want to date at her age. or maybe she doesn't want to be that serious about the relationship. id say just ask her why she doesn't want to date you.|`|iv9T4Ctgaa	Ask again.  If she uses the same reply, ask her just how could the relationship be ruined?  If she actually answers the question with some sort of substantive answer, reassure her that no ruination will occur.  Try this once, and only once.  If she hems and haws around a real answer, just give up, because...maybe she's just trying to be polite and she doesn't want to go out with you.    Good luck.|`|ydPOlK3uaa	i guess she doesn't want it to be awkward to date one of her friends.
xZOHlSXsaa	If you're not completely, 100%, totally fine, about ALL your previous relationships then I strongly suggest you don't start dating again.    Wait until you're completely over them and then start. I'm saying this because you don't want to start developing feelings for another person if you still have feelings for the last one. It rarely works out in these situations "on the rebound" because, as you said, you are still comparing everyone to your ex.    Once you feel ready, and only when you are truly okay with your past, then start dating again. I wouldn't begin dating "just to get out there". You can do many, many things to "get out there" without getting other people's feelings for you as it will only end in confusion and upset.    You'll know when you want to start dating because you aren't thinking of your ex anymore. You may still be friends with him but you'll be perfectly fine as "just friends".    Hope this helps =)|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Dont say that and dont do this to yrself, dont compare anyone with someone u knew or dated, all people r not the same, all of them have their positive's and negative's, and when u give it a try u will know what i mean, but make sure u take yrself outside yr x circle and make yr own and then get involved in another relation ship, u dont want to mess a relation maybe he is a good person and then yr gonna loose him as well because yr not ready yet.    _K_
3y0w1qIBaa	Just simply tell her that this guy is desperate and that he needs to move on with his life.  If he starts to threaten in any sort of way (such as killing her boyfriend just to get the girl, or stalking around and etc), then you need to tell someone.  I really hate to see that guy taking advantage of this poor girl.
xmWxafHSaa	It could be, flirt with him and see how he responds.  You will never know until you try.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	Likes you|`|RVzwViRyaa	he likes you|`|SxIwUPwPaa	Yep. It sounds like he likes you. Ask him out! :D|`|WauZTodNaa	It's a good bet that he likes you.|`|TXq3bLKRaa	Yep. He likes you!! do you like him?? lol good luck!!|`|ze7aMLZhaa	yeah its a def possibitlity|`|uxzLX8fRaa	ya|`|fuQPOal3aa	aww thats sweet he SO likes u|`|dCvP3w5Waa	he does|`|buYatgxuaa	Most defenately likes you!!! Go get him!!|`|K8slxyrAaa	he got whipped by a girl hes into u but u have to make your first move he wont say that he likes u because hes with his guy friends and he dosent want to show that hes sensetive.. ask him out it might work out good luck and please blush when you ask him out and laugh and smile...|`|UFrcaQQZaa	Girly girl he totally likes u so serious he sounds nice go for it.|`|oNDyhaz2aa	Maybe he is just trying to get behind you.  Let him do the stuff for the next two months then decided.  Oh and you are the only girl so he can only make fun with you, I bet if there was one more he would have left you|`|8KgwSgimaa	digs u hard
LhcN7Ygraa	asking him would be your best bet.  we don't even know the guy so how would we know for sure?
d6V03EVYaa	Oh I am soo sorry to hear about the breakup but by the way I just have to point out that just  last week I broke up with my boyfriend too and his name is Tyler as well.  But anyways I think you will have to wait and see if Tyler thinks that way, but honestly I don't think he knows about you  and him going out together.  So what I am trying to say is just wait and see then everything will fall into place..[=  Hope I helped!!![=|`|AA10455206	There are many kinds of likes..just for a friend, just because he knows you and also the one where he wants to go out with you.  I would take it easy because it sounds as it you are going to fast.  You don't know how his feelings really are toward you.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yes|`|8BVEoMBraa	ahhh couldnt tell youuuu!!! but ha i got two points so it was worth it!!!|`|CDBRXtnLaa	idk just go out with him he is cute|`|i2loDONXaa	I would say yes But,  Get up the nerve and talk to the boy himself, quit relying on hearsay and BFF's and she said and he said and they think to find out.  Just ask him Bluntly "Would you like to go out with me?".  As far as him using you to get to your friend, you should be able to tell that easily enough by his body language around you. When your talking to him and your friend is hear, does his eyes tend to wander to your friend more often than they should? Does he spend more time talking to her, or go out of his way to speak to your friend even if your standing there?  Tips likes this are a sure giveaway that he's using you to get to your friend. If however the above doesn't apply, your in the clear. Go get him girl!!   Good Luck!!
Dfzs9TThaa	you need to call him up and tell him that...he might be feeling the same way or maybe not...if he's not then you should move on because you don't need a guy that doesn't feel the same way for you.  If he does feel the same way then one of you have to make a decision to move or try the long distance relationship....you can always webcam and talk on the phone. It's hard but if you love that someone you will make try to make it work no matter how far he is.
2Hd2lNxwaa	first things first....u need to have confidence...then this confidence will lead to motivation....then jus add sum perseverance and some lifestyle changes and ur good.....start out step by step...maybe start with ur diet...make sure ur eating healthy, then start working out....push urself little by little....little things like one more push up, one more lap, or skipping desserts once and while will help.....basically take it step by step and stay confident...this way u wont have to go through sooooo much change at once.....oh yeh also set goals (realistic ones)....reward urself with a little shopping trip or hang out with ur friends...anyways all this will be easier with a person so see if u can find sum1 that is willing be there and support u...GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LDfXMfyYaa	u cant hard to be natural pal start working out
SsB7aRExaa	Yes, he just used you.   he got what he wanted.  Maybe he even won a bet with his buddies.  It's happened before.    Want to know how this works?  Pay attention:      "Guys play at love to get sex, girls play at sex to get love."    So think about that:  Who wins in this kind of relationship?  Who gets what they want?  There's no love, only the pretense of it.  There IS sex (or at least, making out).    So who got what they wanted, and who got nothing?    This is why marriage is important.    It's about protecting YOU from being used.
9qmAw39Saa	I think if he really liked you then he would be ready.|`|R2BBjtaraa	it sounds like you're pretty young so i think it's probably he doesn't know how to act and stuff. like maybe it was kinda awkward for him.
hL3VsoYTaa	Don't worry about it. I'm in college right now and I know quite a few guys who have never had a girlfriend.  The guy I'm dating right now never had one before me, and he was 19 when we met!  Don't give up just because you got turned down.  Just be yourself, and you'll find somebody one day soon.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	dont worry you'll have a girlfriend, these things take time.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	Don't listen to these idiots saying O JUST WAIT YOU'LL GET ONE EVENTUALLY, YOU'RE A NICE GUY! Don't listen to that BS!  Go out there and go approach girl after girl after girl keep on improving, don't take rejections personally, think of them as a learning experience, that's how you get better, through your failures, and you will see yourself improving overtime if you practice talking to 10 girls every day, learn to flirt, learn to have confidence, don't just take the advice O BE YOURSELF! Cause that advice is crap if being yourself isn't working, you need to improve upon yourself and become a better version of yourself than you already are, once you gain confidence and learn how to flirt and keep up a conversation, you will be bound to get a girlfriend, I'd also recommend reading some crap online on how to talk to girls to get you started, hope I helped!|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	maybe the girls that you talk to aren't the right ones for you. talk to people you're interested in, and maybe they'll be interested in you too. eventually, you'll find a girl thats perfect for you and that feels the same way about you. you're only seventeen, and its way to early to say you'll never have a girlfriend. you have your whole life ahead of you.|`|ykPN1GCPaa	it is possible. but you can change that by trying harder. go get some new cloths and maybe a new hairstyle. talk to girls more, and get to know them, and what they like. make them laugh!!! all girls love a sence of humor. if you can get her to laugh a lot, perfect!!! so..... good luck.  ^.^   hope i helped|`|GoEdpprvaa	Don't worry about this at all. You will get a gf. You should be going to college soon (I assume) & that is the time where women want to take chances & experiment. If you can get along with women now, then you should have no problem getting a gf. In highschool, women are under pressure on who they should date, but after highschool women date any guy that is kind & sweet.  Also, many of your friends who are girls have you in the "friend zone", so you should look else where for a gf.  Good luck :]|`|XOpP4oRJaa	I'm really sorry for u but you'll get a gf eventually  I'm 13 and have never had a gf|`|wpilM8Hiaa	It's possible, but not probable. Just because you don't think girls are interested doesn't mean that they're not! You will find the one for you I'm sure of it!|`|Pf5C6mdkaa	I'll tell you one thing: Asking this question is a sure-fire way to not get one.    Women want sucessful, confident men.  If you're all like "I'll never get a girlfriend", they're not going to start lining up to be your girlfriend.    Man up and go after what you want.
H7fUC8ILaa	wow this is hard for you isn't it?  ummm...i think you should talk to him  but if still doesn't get it try to date someone else  but talk with him first fo rthe last time
Lz4wXr6paa	It doesn't matter about age. Age is but a number. As I say.  Act older, wear some natural makeup, stuff your bra ((hehe))  He will start to noticee you if you stand out. And if you do mature  things he could start to like you.|`|AA11886887	Well that is simple. Most guys that have a chick as a friend is waiting for that friend to give him the opportunity. So give him that opportunity, make it known that you are into him and he will jump on it. But you have to make it known or he is going to think the time is not right. Most likely he is your friend because he does not have any game and had to settle as a friend.|`|FljIic6Iaa	I disagree with the first answer, im in the same position and recently we've become best friends, if your close enough to him i think you should probably try to bring it up, the older girl thing is irrelevant lol some guys do have morals. He may just be a friend, be really careful how you read the signs, give him a few hints and see what happens, good luck :)
tY4hOjqdaa	This is wide open....you could get her flowers and make her a nice dinner at your place or go all out with gifts, flowers, dinner, etc....    The best Valentine I gave was with my Ex: I knew she had not rode horses for sometime so it was something she loved to do. I told her we would start in the afternoon doing something special - so I took her to a horse stable and arena where you can rent horses by the month and we spent time there. We then went to a supply store in the country on our way to dinner - the White Horse Inn. I bought her a few things there and we went to dinner at the White Horse Inn(five course meal wine, etc,...) after dinner I told her we were going on a sleigh ride. This Inn had that so you could walk right out of the restaurant and off to the woods. They had some hot coco while you waited to get on the SR. Mid way through the ride I gave her the Valentines gift, a diamond and blue sapphire studded silver charm bracelet from Tiffany's(all horse related charms). After this we went shopping at Victorias Secret for some sexy things she wanted.....we then went back to my place for a hot closing.|`|bGcUdRkyaa	that's so cute um......you should probably get her something she likes but the best gift is love, or find out her size of cloths and get her some cloths and jewelery. good luck
OeIje9yraa	maybe hes not experienced or whatever.. he obv. likes you.. and is proud that your his gf, since he's telling EVERYONE that you two are together. But maybe he just doesnt know what to do with you, or how to act! Since your quiet, he may also feel that your not putting in the effort! I say you talk to him and let him know how your feeling!|`|8SEVTKz5aa	he seems to like u bcus hes telling every1, so its like hes proud u guys r together   also, he might not text u back cuz its wasting his minutes. sum plans r  realllllllllly expensive  as for V day, just wait it out& see, u cant really rush it. if u ask him bout it, it might spoil any surprises he might have for u|`|dFCZCB6Faa	bonjor thrika mamo bibo|`|QMYGptJDaa	give him a bj
0711cf00ce1887a2b0a0fc8858a57469aa	She's easy. They know she's going to give them some. They don't love them, they love what they can do for them. But in the end, every guy, except the total jerks that you don't need to be messing around with, just wants a "good girl" that's going to treat them right.   Guys don't even care what a girl looks like when they're horny. They're looking for a quick fix that they don't have to do themselves. Any guy who you see that "enjoys" what she does, it's only short lived. They'd be more happy with a girl like you. They don't really want a girl that's going to get with anyone, they like to keep their girls to themselves, they're really not fond of sharing.|`|1o3cJoldaa	idk but its annoyingg|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Because it turns them on.  Let them be attracted to the whores...|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Because they think there going to get some and there stupid enough to believe it, lol.|`|OYzPApodaa	Because guys love whores.........lol|`|meAr7GIYaa	They think they're easy.  A lot of high school guys will go for the easy girls cause they can get sex out of it.   Of course, there are some guys that don't like girls like that.|`|Wa1kwOHkaa	I'm going to make the assumption that you're in high school.    At that age, most of the boys are immature and want an "easy" girl, meaning they go for the really shallow, like the one mentioned.    There's this old saying about an apple tree:  The good apples are at the top, and the bad ones are at the bottom.  The boys who come by pick the bottom apples because they don't want to work for the good ones at top and because they don't want to fall the distance.
UDu828VEaa	Professor Chester says you must first approach her, and start talking to her, small talk.  How's the weather, nice day, straight forward answers.  Keep an eye on her body language, see if she wants to talk or not.  If not, try another day with step 1.  If so then keep at it day after day, then when you two are talking like long lost friends, ask her if she wants to meet for a coffee.  And then from there ask for a little more; example : Hey, there is this great movie I just heard of, do you want to go?  Stuff like that, then when you both are comfortable with each other, then start asking the question you want to know.  Hope this works to your favour.|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	What are you waiting for ? Say that you like her . And ask if she already have a significant other . Then ask her if she wants to be your girlfriend but make sure you include " if u don't mind me asking or if you don't need more time " so you won't sound rude . It's okay telling her . Don't make jokes to find love . And One Tip :    ('V')---------------------------> Love her Right For Feedback Love ! ;)|`|AA12011293	first you might want to learn proper grammar chief!! =]|`|V4CpwM55aa	And I quote,    "talk to her and kinda flirt with her"    Thats what you have to do, wait after class and do this    by the way you sound like you're in 8th grade, cut the love b.s. and grow some balls|`|sUn45rWwaa	i think u should ask her out on a casual date like to a movie.....and get to kno each other and if u think u think that u really clicked then ask her out on V-day!!!!!!! that would be really sweet!! :)|`|6c5bcf7e051cb85d0792bb2edfdb04b2aa	Ask her if it hurt when she dropped from heaven.     Every girl falls for it. After you say it, she will get down on the floor and beg for you to be her master.|`|RHIJ6OPQaa	just dont seem like too obsessed and stuff and dont be like OMG i love you cuz she'll be freaked out just take it slow and be like 'hey i think your really cool, we should hag out sometime" or something like that!!!    hope i helped :)|`|i91XARbuaa	Ask her if see needs help in sschool or something so then u guys can hang. or just start to talk to her more.|`|PW1kjBJyaa	Hmm. You might try getting to know her in class...You know, actually going up to her and talking to her. Complement her on something she has. It doesn't have to be clothes, maybe like, her backpack or something. Try becoming her friend first.   I don't wanna tell you to do something totally dramatic and looking like a fool, so just try that ^out and se how it goes. Good luck! ^_^|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Lick their cheeks!|`|rVPT2tx1aa	make lots of eye contact, tease her a little, touch her arm when you talk to her, start conversations with her, etc.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Yes.|`|TPdQBF2yaa	"hey *name* wanna have sex with me"|`|WJ1agL9Eaa	Well home bro lol what you got to do is go right in for the kill... and what i mean is that you can not be shy you got to go and claim it your land (your lady) so just walk up and be like hey there you know give her your number and stuff it will be good man!|`|ojwRgCLqaa	I think you should walk up to her and tell a few jokes. Then start talking about other stuff not as funny, and a little more serious (maybe things you have in common or something). Then you should keep doing that a few more times so it's not so weird. After that you can probably just talk to her and it wouldn't be weird. Get to know her and let her get to know you. Then maybe she'll see that she likes you too. It might even be good to give her a valentine or something for valentines day once it's not akward to talk to her.    Obvious ways guys flirt: tickling girls, sometimes hugs, teasing, etc|`|MgiK02Zbaa	your pretty ;]|`|Vk1Aj44Waa	yeah you and me both man  girls are hard to talk to  =/ especially for ppl like me |`|8BVEoMBraa	jUST BE LIKE WOAHH WHATS THIS DONE MY PANTS CAN YOU TOUCH IT AND TELL ME!|`|HJqPsZo8aa	Start up a casual conversation with her, complement her, walk her to her next class, say hi to her in the hallways when you pass eachother and smile while doing it.|`|TwwMtHBxaa	sit at the table she sit at lunch and make a few jokes try making  her laugh then tell her she has a very pretty laugh then tell her that you guys should hang out more often|`|QkmoNX2Qaa	Ok, first of all, what type of jokes are u saying i class, coz a few guys do it in my class 2. And although I smile or laugh along, I find it really immature. So it really depends what girl she is.  What I would so is maybe in the hallway I would flip out my phone and just casually ask, hey whats ur number?? I should add it to my cell.   She'll most likely tell u.  When txting her, always say xo when saying goodbye.   Flirting by txt is really easy. Person is a bit harder.  But if u smile a lot and maintain eye contact thats a plus.  For valnetines, I would just maybe buy a box of chocolates (Guillians are good.) And slip it in her bag when she's not looking, or when she's not with it.   It would sorta ruin it if she caught u in the act, so be careful.  I would also attach a card to it.   More flirting tips are also saying that she looks nice today, or that her hair looks good. Don't say she smells nice or something coz that may freak her out haha.  Oh, and if cellphones are banned at school, maybe pass her a note saying, do u have an 021? or whateva its called in the us or where u are.   It's pretty cute when guys send u notes 2!  Oh, and u better check if she has a boyfriend. So when your txting her, I would suggest casually slipping it in. Not abruptly like at the start. And do NOT txt her all the time. Coz that get's really anoying also.   Just maybe txt her 1nce every 2 days. Or when she wakes up send her a txt saying, morning! xox   Coz thens he knows that ur thinking about her!   Goodluck!! xox    Oh and giving hugs are a really good way to flirt. Maybe when u see her in the hallway! Just give her one, but make it obvious! I would start with waving first though, coz if she rejects u (hopefully not) then that's really embarrassing!  U could ask her to a movie. Just casually. Don't kiss her on the first date, leave her wanting more.. But give her a hug when she leaves.       Just smile, and be confident! But not playa or anything, coz thats a turn off.  xxx
eURLdGiZaa	yea i guess so, it's one of those situations where it could go either way, but it seems like he likes you. you should ask him = )
h1G9WyeXaa	i think he is trying to make you jealous, but before anything happens, if you like him, and you got the impression that maybe he likes you too, ask him out! who knows? this could really work out!    **** luck|`|Xprsabo9aa	He might (:    loll i think you should just tell him how you feel|`|15Zr5voMaa	it sounds like he is trying to make you like him by liking someone else and trying to make you jealous.|`|uCF9YYYCaa	i think that he liked you and still does but since you wont make a move hes trying to make u jealous and show u that he likes some other chick.|`|i91XARbuaa	Damn, ya your friends probably right. guys do that sometimes to make u be on the edge.|`|9cpcu9mpaa	In my opinion this boy doesn't know what he wants, or he just a plain player. If he really liked you he wouldn't spend his time trying to make you jealous, that's just stupid. In my opinion, what you need to do it talk to this guy and get things all cleared up. If he does like other girls, then you should just move on from him. Hope I helped good luck!
7n4rtfp6aa	ohhh my... erm just kiss her on the lips gently without using your tongue and then if she responds back to you hold her close and kiss her again maybe this time slowly and very sweetly involving your tongue in the process (dont be a washin machine-keep it simple). and well thats how you kiss :D oh and dont forget to close your eyes- it's rude to stare!|`|zecLsI8oaa	It's so much worse if you try to plan things.. honestly, if she's done more than you like you say she has, she'll know what to do and she'll take the lead if you just kiss her.  :)|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Don't plan it out. Just roll with it and if the time seems right kiss her.|`|13mDJotJaa	i agree with the first one
2Cvdu454aa	this might not be her liking you, this could be her simply missing your company. you've shared some good experiences and time together and she enjoyed it. now she wants your company again  try being friends but don't jump into something too soon  once your friends you can ask her and she will be closer to you and she will be able to give you an honest answer :) xo|`|hnwMC1XQaa	don't just tell her.   flirt with her and stuff.|`|dFCZCB6Faa	go 4 it|`|hEcKmleVaa	It sounds like she's making an effort to talk and so are you.  Maybe she is coming to the conclusion that your fights and the break-up were all over dumb things that really didn't matter??  Have you reached the same conclusion?  Talk it over with her.  If you still like her, you might as well let her know it!|`|bE6ulnRUaa	no, keep distance- if she still has feeling for you maybe she'll tell you-forgeting her might be hard but for only being together 4 months-should be eaiser than years, id say move on or stay apart for a min|`|KKPsTOXgaa	make it sound casual. and yes go for it.    sounds like she likes you again and wants to give it another try.|`|h88GotRVaa	she definitely still likes you otherwise she wouldn't waste her time talking to you. go for it!    oh and good luck ;)|`|PMb7Db8Raa	I think you should just flat out ask her if she likes you and go from there. It sounds like she does though =)
NvaK57Phaa	it's me again. it was dumb to get banned for
dIjLmMYFaa	Stick around colleges. I bet there are some exchange students.|`|AA10510645	JFK airport.... at the gate where the plane is going to Turkey. Ya hurd?
7yrdcqY1aa	you should make the night at the park the most romantic night ever and one that she will never forget! don't over crowd her though, but show her total respect, and maybe bring like something that would mean lot to her like flowers but that's so cliche so make it something personal to your relationship and tell her how much you love and care about her!|`|FmIAKDJLaa	If you want the love to last you need to learn to trust her. You cant keep her hidden away or she'll start to resent it and you. Take her out places, you can be a little jealous of other guys but dont take it too far. Trust that she likes you enough to stick with you.|`|GQdxDkA9aa	well as i always say the only guy that deserves a girl is the one that thinks he doesn't and you have that im pretty sure u wont lose her. just be sure not to be too clingy or she will break it off ok good luck!
4kmUX5pHaa	Neither you are crazy nor all the boys are same. As you know the world is full of varieties and this guy is one of them rare variety. You should better do not keep any soft corner for him and do not show any response to his childish behaviour. It is even waste of time to think over such boys.|`|abF3qO3aaa	Most guys are like this lol. They are so damn confusing. Maybe you need to just ask him right out. Though if he's dating another chick you might want to stay away from him until he's single again. I think that if he wanted to date you again he wouldnt be dating the other girl|`|m5NV1GBUaa	Maybe he still likes you.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	Get over him, he sounds like a loser!  You already know that since you broke up and he dated another girl immediately.  Go find yourself a nice guy that you can flaunt in front of Chip and show Chip what he is missing out on!!!
abF3qO3aaa	You were raped girlie. No matter what he says after the fact, he was sober enough to remember what he was doing to you. Drinking doesnt make you do things that you normally wouldn't, it just gives you the "courage" to actually go through with it. He wouldn't have raped you if he didn't want to. Do you understand. You need to talk to someone about this like your mom.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	why do people blame thing on alcohol wen you drink alcohol you lose your Inhibitions you don't go brain dead-get rid of him|`|5LT6LRUZaa	being drunk is not an excuse EVER! under any circumstances!    NO means NO...my ex husband used to rape me sober...should we say that because he was my "husband" that it made it right?    what he did was wrong  you have two choices in my mind, you either report him and break up with him, or you let the reporting of it go and break up with him, I vote for the first option, are we supposed to believe this is the drunkest he's ever been in his life being in the military and has never done this before?  I find that very doubtful, forced sex IS RAPE, doesn't matter if he's your boyfriend or if he was drunk...it's not up to YOU to make sure he never drinks that much again...inhibitions can be lowered when drunk...but being under the influence is not excuse enough to be violent and to be the aggressor...if this happened to you I will guarantee you something similar will happen whenever he drinks too much...he cannot be "Excused" because of the alcohol...and it seems to me you're looking for a way to excuse this, you need to get real....how can YOU control him and what he drinks?  how can YOU be so sure this was an isolated incident?  how can YOU be so sure this will never happen again with you or anyone else???   you know the answer...it's not YOUR job to make sure of any of this or to be in a position to have to excuse this behavior as a result of one drunken night, YOU need to worry about YOU!    if his being drunk is an excuse for it...then I guess it could be said that you being drunk meant you had it coming?  Now that statement is wrong on so many levels and it seems to me that maybe he wants you to carry the burden of what he did not only the trauma of it but his own so called "guilt" as well...drop him like a rock and turn him in!!!!|`|MN8MDFzMaa	Well if he raped you there is no question he should go to jail in the army or not, but if you do not feel good about sending him to jail talk to him about what happened ask him why the hell did you do that. But him he hurt you then of course he should go to jail|`|VmVPGEOgaa	this is horrible,being a drunk is not an excuse ,raping is a crime to be punished about and if he loves he would never do something you do not want to do ... trust me if you need an advice stay away from him and report about what he have done to you ..|`|juI2Z7Kaaa	First, i feel that u are in love with him.  The rape u mentioned makes me think if really happened or not. Im sorry, but i feel that u were also carried away when it happened. Tell him what transpired and see his reaction. If he cares for you and that he is serious with you then go on with relationship. We are responsible of our actions. I think, same act will happen again specially now that Valentines Day is approaching.Only you can protect yourself. If you think he is serious with you and sure of having him for husband then take the risk but if u unsure that he feels the same towards you, then think again.Please love yourself.Be responsible of your actions. I wish the best for you!|`|cBSsk1k5aa	you were raped. end of story. Most women ARE raped by people they know. He deserves to be punished because he forced you into sex. It doesn't matter if he was drunk or not. You need to report it.|`|m6PzOXVxaa	Abuse is Abuse. And it is not acceptable! You should tell his CO and tell him why you told on him. drinking only throws around actual thoughts that a person has. I fear that if he did it once and saw no consequence then he might do it again drunk or not! And it could be worse|`|v5sucz5Gaa	what is he gonna do to you next time he gets drunk? he tells you not to let him drink like that again but can you really control something like that??  Imagine being on edge everytime he takes a sip worrying about what is coming afterwards. and not just you, other girls would be in trouble with this guy. Trust me, DONT BUY THE "I WAS DRUNK" bullcrap. nobody gets THAT DRUNK and if he does he has a serious problem that need to be addressed. You need to DUMP THIS GUY while you can . And tell someone what happened. I almost know you wont do it but i really hope you consider it. Its ONLY THE BEGINING!!|`|sMu8midlaa	He probably wont stop either, and it's most likely going to happen if you don't say something.  Either talk to him and tell him how you feel, honestly.  If he really loves you, he will understand you and know how you feel.
LkRivHpTaa	get him drunk at a party and bang him|`|TMi1GhSHaa	he does like you im guessing you guys are in middle school?? aww so cute its puppy love!!|`|MQCT1FXjaa	be a smart as$.  :] it worked for me fo my immature boy problem.  and its funny when the teacher puts him in his place for talking back..:]|`|AA10510645	My guess is that you've never addressed this sort of stuff with him... go up to him and say something like, "Listen, dic*head, I'm sick of you being an ****** to me. Either let me know why you're doing it, or don't do it at all. Feel me?" And be done with it.|`|9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	curse him out and kiss him and maybe he will be so confused he might listening|`|Amnjqfk0aa	stand up to him say "you are an incredibly rude person and back the hell off cause im not interested" that is... if your not interested|`|MDtBuOaMaa	kick him in the nuts super hard and tell him to respect you. he'll listen then.|`|KoSYMa2laa	First off....what grade are you in?  Maturity may have a lot to do with his actions.  Try to talk to him about it and tell him it would really mean a lot if he'd respect you while you are in theatre arts together.  You may also try saying, "Look, I know we're not friends, but you could cut me some slack every now and then."  If you have to, get an attitude with him and show him your the boss.      I hope this helps.  Sometimes you have to be mean in order to earn respect.|`|2Hh0RuxLaa	He's just an immature jerk as you noted.    However, I have just one question:  Why do you feel it is necessary for him to listen to YOU ???    Ignoring a jerk is the best way to get rid of him.  unless you have a stalker.   Plus I have a warning: do not try to make a snappy comeback to any of his taunts.   that is what he wants.   He wants to know that he's "gotten you".      I wouldn't recommend it, but there was one jerk in the school when I was in high school.    and I kicked him in the nuts.   Just be prepared for retailiation if you do.    LD

(plus, it can give acne to some people)    I think you should work out. Muscle weighs more than fat. A picture would help because I don't really wanna measure the height out and just, a picture would be easier.|`|hXFndli2aa	nope you are not fat, it sounds to that before you were stick and know you've got some meat on you. If you feel unhealthy maybe you should start exercising and making healthier choices when you eat.|`|sNZItLQHaa	No, not fat.

Plus, it helps excrete toxins in the body.    If you're happy with the way you are, then who are we to judge. Just make sure your health is ok.    If you want to workout, then I think it's beneficial, either way. It's about feeling good, within, regardless, right?|`|AA10155617	your only fat in your mind set. if your not happy with your weight then do something about it. but if your happy then it shouldn't matter. in my mind your not fat, but at the same time i'm 5'3 and weigh 118 pounds and i think im fat. lol.|`|kh29r5Yjaa	well....as long as u can still pop an erection--your fine. Worrying about your wait is for bitches dude!|`|aO5GCS94aa	many, many , many people gain weight once they're in college.  it's natural. my advise to you is to make healthy choices when eating and have a well balanced diet. join a club in college that allows you to exercise. what kinds of sports and activities are you interested in?  or maybe you don't want to join a club- there's always on demand yoga and excersize tapes! do whatever interests you, and stick with it.     i honestly can't catigorize you as "fat" or not, but just be sure to be happy with yourself, it's what really matters :)|`|bGcUdRkyaa	well if you have man boobs that are big and a belly that sticks out i think you are.......|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Umm, your Bmi is 26.3 and the over weight category is 25-29.9.  So you are slightly overweight. This has nothing to do with this but, by any chance are you Zach perez aka James DiPilato's friend?  If so, this is his sister lol.|`|jZN1uxjraa	just watch your weight but you're not fat yet.
a377ba90f2bd85e0a93ebe1b8b68470faa	Larry, I looked at your other questions and answers and I've got to say you have such low self esteem. You say you've never had a girlfriend and women aren't attracted to you because of your looks. But at the same time, you said you never asked a girl out?? OF COURSE you're not going to have a girlfriend if you never ask one out!  Who's fault is that? Don't blame women, blame yourself. How can you say women aren't attracted to you if you never even asked a woman out?   Never asked a woman out=never been rejected. Right?  Continuously asking the same questions over and over for years on yahoo answers isn't going to help you.     And no, women don't care only about the looks. Studies show men have a significantly higher value on looks than women do.  Also Larry, you're miserable because you think you're ugly and desperate to have a girlfriend. Yet you want a "smoking hot" girlfriend. Have you ever thought about miserable women who have low self esteem like you? Don't be a hypocrite. There are more to woman than just looks. An attitude like this, chances are you will most likely not make a good husband, and especially father. Your kids certainly will not be learning anything good from you. Your marriage would most likely end up in a divorce.    If you're so insecure about your looks, maybe you can get some contacts. Buy clothes that are the latest trend. And about your bald issues, I've seen many bald guys married or have a girlfriend. Also be confident; confidence is very attractive to women. If you're never going to ask a girl out, you're never going to have a girlfriend. Yes, you can get rejected. But doesn't everyone? Rejection is absolutely normal. Almost every human being gets rejected. What you can do is make a lot of friends with women and get to know them more. Then later you can maybe ask them out for lunch or something. And remember, be confident and smile often. Good luck~    What is uglier? A large woman or a bald guy?  Everyone has different opinions.  Some large women are beautiful while some aren't.  Some bald guys are good looking someone aren't.|`|AA10237782	Shallow?|`|JDRj44xMaa	Neither? Depends.    I've seen overweight women who are REALLY pretty, bald guys who are HOT.    There's beauty in the making.
nEPpG3VDaa	Yes, Of course you will. Maybe that person is right in front of you or just taking a little longer then you want to find you.|`|cn2B9ebJaa	im also looking 4 it. but ive stopped cuz im tired of being sooo disappointed, its depressing    as to ur question, im no psyhic
sZePlWTQaa	Since he doesn't NEED anything..these are cute, from the heart ideas..    -Buy a fish and bowl and write a note along with it "You're the only fish int he sea for me" You can also cut out little hearts and write "i" on one, "love" and then "you" on another. Laminate or cover with tape. Tie to a rock and put in bowl.    -I bought a plain, uncut key from home depot and got it engraved at a jewelers that said "You have the key to my heart"    -Fill a small jar with 365 pennies. Write a note "Find a penny, pick it up, all day you'll have good luck. For the past 365 days I have had nothing but luck being able to be with you"    -Candy idea: Put these all in seperate bags-  "60 starbursts, for every second of every minute my heart is bursting to be with you"  "60 Hershey kisses for every minute of every hour I want to kiss you"  "24 Twizzlers for every hour of everyday I want to be wrapped up with you"  "365 pieces of gum for every day of every year I want to stick with you"    You can even hide the bags and give clues to find the next.|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	maybe something simple like a card and a box of chocolate. or you could make a little book that says "a year together" and put in all of your favorite moments, with pictures (hand drawn or photographed) and add cute captions. that might be corny... but i think it would be cool|`|qeUoAW6naa	Maybe chocolates (if he likes them). Or maybe a men's grooming kit (you know, with beauty products for men). Or something he may find handy, like a tool. Anything! You would know his tastes the best.|`|comuT2fkaa	you can get him a personalized  dog tag necklace.  order it and put a sweet and personal engraving on   there for him.|`|cutfMQ4xaa	You should get him a nice piece of jewellery or a nice shirt or something, don't just get him a card, the first year is so special!|`|kh29r5Yjaa	OKAY!!!  This sounds way too obvious!  Your boyfriend is telling you not to get himm anything because truly..  he wants you to take something from him!  --His virginity!  Trust   He will be happy!
dOPuO7iPaa	damn, stealing my move.     yea, hes interested in you.     unless hes gay, and at that point hes just being friendly.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	aww yes he wants to get to know you better, thats sweet, talk to him more.
dkMceLYhaa	yeah lay off other peoples man until they break up|`|V4CpwM55aa	he obviously likes her girlfriend    unless you wanna be a psycho lay off crazypants|`|GNGmnIKiaa	welll im 14 sooo I've experienced this before and can imagine this, i would sayy continue talking to him because you never know if he's really into her and if he really likes you and you leave him alone he's gonna think you don't like him and if he breaks up with his girlfriend you most likely won't get your chance, you probably shouldn't ask him out let him ask you cause that would show that he likes you, and if he goes out of his way to talk to you or talks to you more than he does his girlfriend then he probably wants you haha and also if his girlfriend knows about you and says something to you with like concern then he likes you lol !but good luck =]|`|1Lo0wd09aa	quite frankly if he actsz like he likesz yu i think he might b a tad bit confused of who he rlly likes....i think dat maybe yu shuld tlk to him bout it if dat dont wrk thn maybe yu shuld jush leave him alone cuz if yu mess wit him while he got a girl in da end yur most likely gunna be da one left hurt in da end n he wont care and dont wait for him life goes on [ i kno a bit harsh but thts reality] cuz if he rlly likesz yu he wuld b wit yu
fQgbBx7caa	They can all jump in the lake and tell them so.  So lets say you were going out with the best looking guy in the world and he treated you like crap?   Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself either.   None of their business you need new friends....|`|gMG31qVyaa	okay... you can't love someone after being together for 2 weeks. if your friends were real friends they would want to see you happy... not give you cr@p for dating someone who THEY THINK is not attractive. just tell her this is your decision, not hers, and that you're happy so she should be happy for you.    stick up for your man!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	After just two weeks of "going out", I would hardly consider him a boyfriend.    Your "friends" are jealous.  Think about whether or not they are helpful to your life.    You don't "love" him.  You won't know what love is for many years.
9GUuVYinaa	I think it's HOT.  She's never been touched....I like new cars over used one's!|`|UNGM6Xk7aa	well i guess if that girl has visually expirienced sex and kissing and been around it then i guess it would be ok|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Actually, that did happen to me...sort of.  I did meet a girl who was just like that but she was 17.  It didn't change the way I felt at all.  I fell deeply in love with her.  She asked me out and she was so beautiful I couldn't say no.  Here's the difference, I was 34 at the time and no I'm not a pedophile.  I wasn't the one who started the whole thing.  She was the first to tell me she loved me and yes she was a virgin who had never kissed a guy until me.  She was embarrassed to tell me she didn't know how to kiss but let me tell you, she didn't need any coaching on kissing.  It comes naturally.  We had an amazing two years together until she cheated on me.    Hope this answers your question.|`|DLHkoO81aa	I like it. I mean you can't help but to feel a little special. being her first kiss or first anything. Especially if you really like her.|`|JKtthwaMaa	No. Virgins are hot lol
RgbARcJTaa	eye contact  blinking alot(i think)  blushing  giggling  kinda close to you|`|s4TMc1vqaa	smiles at you, laughs at your lame jokes(if you have them), touches you. LOTS of eye contact, asks to hang out, compliments anything you have or have on.|`|7N2YPjkEaa	some girls r just natural flirts, so dont get all worked up, but if she glances over to u alot, and smiles and stuff shes probably flirting... i on the other hand flirt ALOT  more distinctly... like sexual comments, and stuff... so if shes like me, but happens to glance at u every once in awhile shes probably not flirting..|`|rnXLZJyXaa	It can be hard to tell, usually it can be as simple as looking at you, and you'll look back at her, and she'll look away.  If you talk with confidence to her and flirt with her though, she could get to like you...looks matter much more to guys than to girls, girls can have an amazing body and an amazing chest and get just about any guy, while a guy can still have the best body and pecs ever, and he still won't be able to get a girl if he isn't about to attract her through his personality.|`|lmxKpZeNaa	touchs you casually or for no reason if your in a bad mood she asks why draws attention to her eyes or lips etc. she is jut playfull and is giving you signs and is trying to get your attention
8bc0fdf31e05f7fc5f7a7d8911734b0caa	dude, I am older and I have been there many times in the past because I was stupid and I later realized, after many times having my heart broken, by wasting my time waiting for a person that doesn't feel the same for me, that it is really a waste of time.  I know you said you don't want another girl, but if this girl truly liked you, she would have found the poem endearing (who wouldn't!) and she obviously is interested in someone else, so why bother??  I mean, dude, you sound young.  You WILL find other girls.  We always assume when we like someone that that person IS THE ONE.  And then years later, you will say to yourself "boy, what was I thinking!".  Please don't do anything rash, as you will find the right girl.  Be happy OK?  Put yourself out there and try to meet other girls..... girls that ARE TRULY INTO YOU.  By the way, keep in mind that NOT EVERY GIRL is going to be into you and same for all the girls you meet, won't be your "type", as it goes both ways, but you have to build a tough exterior and have confidence and self esteem because it doesn't mean you are ugly.  It just means you were not the one.  No big deal. You will be someone's eventually.  Don't rush it.|`|99ErPXlmaa	I don't know if all be much help but I think you should tell her how you feel. If I were her I'd love to hear that :)
7AFLaiYjaa	the foursome guy is really obnoxios.    Anyway its common to liek 2 girls or maybe her and her friend are alike in some way and that intrested you.|`|258mrT2Paa	sounds like a foursome to me.
jCPM5GJiaa	anonymous complaint.|`|0kVDII2saa	believe me its better physiiiical than verbal!!    and please ansswer the first question under my profile thanks so much!!  XOXO   sarah
f8auCNQvaa	Leave a note in her locker one day asking them to hang out or go out to dinner.
YyMFDs6Eaa	ew no
lGBbWsuSaa	Lol.. its ok . Alot of people act like that when theyre around someone they like. Mostly cuz they dont wanna seem weird or awkward to them...but you end up acting awkward anyways trying not to haha . Just be yourself ..thats all u really can do =]|`|3f4jZwLlaa	don't worry the same thing would totally happen to me! you probably just get giggly because (like you said) you like him. just think that he is just a really close friend and it will be like your friends are there|`|H3SoAaycaa	eat some sauce
TzlscXcCaa	He really likes you because u said that you always talk and get along well.  If he didn't like you he wouldn't still with you.
PQ1vBjFdaa	aww. thanks! but so are other races. but i have to say that we are raise to be both smart and know how to take care of apperance and treat people right.|`|IrvvJrg4aa	Ur right! We r hot!|`|Sh9vS1Djaa	ive never picked up on this ...  i dont think so...|`|zdlS3fgDaa	Beg to differ. Asian girls are ew.|`|Zq772U4Aaa	i dk they just are|`|5f8f97b596d7b2be44810ceadae63a38aa	They have to be hot to match the Asian blokes....
JDRj44xMaa	Hmm.. With me, I usually can never sustain a friendship with a guy, bc it ends up being more than that, so I back off as a way to be 'real' so I don't feel like I string him a long. I feel guilty if I do.    If I'm in a serious (exclusive) relationship, then I won't hang  out with guys (knowing that this is the case)..    I think your gut is right. I wouldn't call it insecurity. I call it instinctive male/female behavior. In most cases, one party usually falls for the other or both do.    Yeah- that's touchy. Really depends. Listen to your heart. There are girls who you may find attractive that are loyal. Just be smart & selective. Good luck!!|`|ybuYxaGTaa	Women are total b@st@rds, apart from my Mum.|`|YK5LPopCaa	I think it is OK to have friends who are male if you're female and in a relationship. If someone commits and they are a genuine person you should trust them, without trust there's nothing. Jealousy ruins relationships. I should know.     I had long distance relationship with a jealous man and I have lots of male friends. I ended up resenting my boyfriend because of his lack of trust. Which was a shame because I had thought the world of him, but understood that whatever the truth was, in his head I was untrustworthy. It's not nice to be made to feel untrustworthy. So whatever you once had gets eaten away at.     Maybe if a girl would rather spend time with her male friends than with her boyfriend then there might be an issue.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	hes just a friend... truth the women!  most likely you'll cheat on her than the other way around..  girls usually are more committed|`|3RHSSEDnaa	Personally I think having friends is great.  Depending on your relationship, if it is secure and loving and you trust each other - no probs.  If you let the green eye of jealousy get out - then you will loose her for not trusting her or valuing her.    If you have no reason to be inscure except for your own stories in your head - talk to her and clear the air.  Just let her know that you would feel better if you were all together if she wanted to be with her friends. then you would have to be gracious.    If you love her & she you - what is the problem?|`|FQvoUtwDaa	Some girls, like me, just get along better with guys than other girls. I remember when I was in college, I had a few guy friends that I hung out with and without my fiance. He had no problem with it. Now there weren't that many guy-friends that I had, and I didn't spend an exorbitant amount of time with them. Many times in fact, my fiance would accompany me when I went out with them.     I think maybe if she spends way more time with them than she does with you, then that seems a little wrong. Unless there's a reason for that, like if you're at work all the time, then what is she suppose to do, just stay home and not do anything? I think it just depends. But I would definitely call it an insecurity issue if a guy has a problem with his girlfriend just because she has guy friends that she hangs out with.
4qcXECiPaa	girls notice confidence and you being yourself, dont act like someone you aren't you need to like yourself for who you are before others will like you once you like yourself others will catch on to your natural confidence.|`|KSq8DXlfaa	Hi, we had pretty much this same discussion a while ago. Remember, I was the one who gave you the REALLY long answer that u should act like yourself and find a talent to help you stand out and act decently and all, and I'm the nutcase with the crush who changed into a jerk?:) If you give me more details, I'll edit this answer...have u tried what I suggested before??
KkOzs2Czaa	"(    Poor guy, r u slow?   unless he was seeing 4 a friend|`|kdN0iRdtaa	yes yes yes a hundred time yes hes in LOVE with you|`|jxseTHg7aa	if he was that blunt about it then yes|`|AA11448737	If he's not man enough to come out and ask you, you DO NOT want him!|`|VzzQP2PJaa	Without a doubt...he was trying to throw you hints so that you ask him.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	For heaven's sake ask the guy. How strong a hint do you need?|`|7N2YPjkEaa	duh|`|RgbARcJTaa	he wants youu|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	uhh...YEAH!|`|Cyl1zd6Vaa	hell yes|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Yes, he wants you to ask him. I'm sure if he could have spelled it out for you he would have, but he might of figured you'd catch his drift.|`|oDAL9UG9aa	Yes, that was his way of saying that he wanted to go with you without making you feel completely pressured. I would ask him to go only if you want to go with him though.|`|iq6fo6SRaa	come on lady.. it's obvious he wanted you to ask him... he just didn't want to be direct. now it depends on you if doing it or not.|`|5YUk0L22aa	yup he wanted you to ask him|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Where has the world gone to?...|`|kHHpzAkKaa	yes|`|z1mgBf5daa	i think so|`|4VDbwLJnaa	no duh!|`|X62bXbmxaa	He loves you. Marry him
LpZ8iO6qaa	talk to him and get to know the guy. For all you know he could think you're cute too. If you don't want to talk to him but flirt just do what he's doing. Give him a "look" the next time you see him. Maybe he'll wonder if you like him too. =]
PmGxucdOaa	Just learn to accept how people are and how the world is.People are mostly shallow and michievous.Listen the only people you deserve in your life is the people that need you in their life.Just know that you're a nice,sweet person and if no one don't want apart of that then that just means they are bad people.
93mWGqL6aa	Tell him to write a 3 and turn it upside down.
THIvlI4waa	1. Proposing at a sporting event.  Arrange to have his proposal broadcast over the public address system or displayed on the large screen.    2.Having the DJ of his girlfriends favorite radio program ask her if she will marry him is another idea.     3. Include all of his and her family and friends in the event by inviting them all to a surprise party for his girlfriend, propose to her then.    4. Recreate your first date. Shell also appreciate his thoughtfulness in trying to recreate that special experience.    5. During dinner,  he could serve his girlfriend a glass of champagne with the engagement ring in the bottom of the glass.     6. Consider dining together at their favorite Chinese restaurant. Have the waiter serve her a fortune cookie with "Will you marry me?" hidden inside.|`|0C04Auafaa	what do they share in common. then you could use that as a way to ask her because she wouldnt expect it.     for example: my dad and mom raced sailboats, so they went sailing one day had a big sail made that said marry me on it. when they went out he told her to raise the main sail and there was the biggest sail blowing in the wind that said marry me. so if you find something you share in common then you could do something like that|`|TXeUeiPHaa	On Valentine's Day sounds realy romantic and sweet so that is a good idea. Ummm tell him to be more creative when he pops the question.
sqmIO2u5aa	you can try searching your father and even locate him by using the online search. with the reliable website, http://www.web-detective.com/index1.aspx... you can acquire  true and accurate information you desire to have. Just being online, you can surely have the result of details quickly..|`|AA10953937	Contact the Veterans Affairs in your city.  They should be able to tell you how you can contact him.
NEw5dsJlaa	It could be somewhat in your head. I have really bad social anxiety, and when I first meet anyone I think they are thinking really bad ugly things about me especially if it's me meeting a group of people not just 1 on 1. It's just a condition within my own mind though. Most women are judgemental of others and even of themselves, moreso than guys, so it could be that too. Or you could be giving off a creepy/pervy vibe if you come on too strong when meeting a pretty girl,.|`|DOdFTsigaa	You can change it by changing the women you hang out with. I think it's damn annoying when people think they are better than others.
gv12vP1kaa	it depends... if she has a legitimate reason then you shouldn't be. such as she is busy that night or something in her family came up... however if she just bailed for no reason, then yes you should because she shouldn't have signed up and led you on, just to bail.     Hope This Helps! =)|`|WkkffhmCaa	just be a little pissed and make her apologise.|`|m2rkfyTTaa	yeah you can be mad she was supposed to be there to support you but also dont dwell on the fact too much your friend may have gotten nervous herself, dont make her feel bad but let her know that real friends are there for each other.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	No.She can bail if she wants lol|`|DOdFTsigaa	If something happened where your best friend couldn't control it then you can't be mad at her but if it was her own decision and she KNEW this was important for you then I would be mad.
zrARzUTPaa	ya if u like him enough y not. u can patch up things wit ur bff but u cant wait on a guy forever
cWy17SRnaa	Before you ask him out make sure he likes you back.  Ask you friends to ask his friends to make sure he likes you.  If he likes you, then ask him out.  Good luck.
SweWC8p1aa	he obviously likes you.. who cares if the shcool find out.. if you really like him and he likes you.. then you guys are going to be a couple eventually! just be really excited :P hope i helped!
1ZeNgdUaaa	It's kinda like the thing with bears.  They're more afraid of you then you are of them, trust me.  For the most part, girls hold all the cards.  Having said that, all you really need to do is RELAX.  If you have guys approaching you and asking for your number that means that your probably quite attractive.  It's OK to be shy and nervous, actually it's pretty cute.  You could even try practicing with a friend on how to talk to guys, but believe me, there is absolutely nothing to be frightened of, good luck!
v1yefcFjaa	just ignore her and become closer with your other friends than she is with them.
GQ6ssNdtaa	I'd say an eight. You look find. next time try not to tuck your chin in, it makes you look like you have a little extra fat.    You look handsome.|`|xQGkWlSKaa	You need to get some confidence!!!! If you don't think you are good looking, then the girl won't either.
HlQ9FKTkaa	-funny  -smells good  -black/brown hair  -longish hair  -skater type  -tall   -clean    :D|`|6Mrhz2CRaa	Well, i think that it is great when guys tell girls how they feel about them. it bugs me to death when they act like they dont like you. Also if your into your relationship for a while its good to tell the girl you love her occasionally just so she knows that your still into her. I like guys that are nice and funny. That's the best answer i have. Sorry if your disapointed.|`|GtxnGKoAaa	I only like guys who are "gifted".|`|ykPN1GCPaa	I like skaters/punks, with dark flippy hair that covers one eye. they HAVE to be funny!!!|`|2YrPaDEiaa	totally jock yet sensetive|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	a guy with a good sense of humor and a great personality, if he looks good thats a plus too =)
xQGkWlSKaa	The guy probably likes you and it hurts him when you flirt with all of the guys that he is friends with. If you want to get closer to him, stop flirting with other guys!!! He probably thinks that you are teasing him.|`|RySDawpOaa	i am guessing his brother said something bad/and or perverted about you and his brother like he said he nailed u or whateva and mabye the boy got offended mabye he liked you?all i know is i am not psychic but i say hurt the guy.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	HE DOESNT LIKE YOU ANYMORE next question please?|`|TCjSJdDeaa	first off all guys are dumb butts. they flirt with lots of girl they dont even like and string them along. lots of time they are nice when they want something, but their true jerk side shows when they get annoyed with you. forget him, hes stupid.|`|FU7tY0nqaa	he sounds upset that you have been talking to his brother as well as his best friend that's kinda messed up. plus he has a girlfriend...he doesn't sound to faithful ,let it go.|`|9FztHceJaa	hes a dumb a**  he proably wants to hook up just dont want noone else to know ignore him pretend like hes just not there|`|UtYllvFcaa	wait r u guy cus i can not tell he prob dates that girl cus she has nice ****|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	maybe when you were trying to talk to him online his girlfriend was with him|`|wNkgIGOIaa	He's seems confused. He probably likes you too but is jealous with the whole best friend and brother thing...Also on msn he could have some of his buddies with him and he's acting like a jerk because they are there.   Try catching hm in the hall and talking to him...If he acts like a jerk infront of you I'd drop him. You probably deserve better anyway than some guy who is a fake...    Hope I Helped...|`|dMTx6QRaaa	idk|`|40HpQquSaa	maybe he wants you to be with him but is jealous cuz he cnt|`|D9D8Ezybaa	hes confused, idk why he'd flirt with u in person then not talk to u on the computer|`|7XbXvsNHaa	maybe hes skitzophrenic?  if not, then maybe you should just move on  hes not worth your time, he oviously like his gf.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	He sounds bipolar.  You could try dating him, but it might not be the relationship you want it to be.  I'd be careful, guys that are nice one day and threaten to delete you the next, aren't good news.|`|UFwz1FqBaa	Leave it alone, he is sure to come around.....................................|`|nfhNu79Aaa	maybe  its not him on msn|`|40whdSDYaa	i think he is jealous and is pretending to ignore u so his girlfriend wnt find out =]|`|DfRD02n2aa	Maybe you should try backing off a little, and i mean that in a nice way! dont go off and tell him how you feel, but play a little hard to get.. he'll think its sexy. when he realizes that he does really like you, hell dump his gf and you two can go out :}    best of luck!|`|bNCcv2fNaa	He probably lost interest in you or outgrew you or maybe you pissed him off. And you are treating his current GF as if she isn't an issue and she absolutely is. You should wait before you do anything except try to be friends until he is single.|`|TlKDDHg3aa	boy at this age can be very strang, usualy from puberty homones... wait a little while and then on nms ask him if everything is ok and what happened|`|AA10503158	might be the girlfriend on instant messenger.  ask his friend/brother whats goin on about that.|`|3f4jZwLlaa	he probably likes you but doesn't want his gf to find out. does his gf not like you cause that could be why he told you he would delete you, she told him too...idk, just guessing.|`|ex2KhEfdaa	he's a guy and he's being standoffish to see if you will stay around. most guys do it. not all but most|`|ifC0M58oaa	Ask him what is wrong in person.|`|c2O4Cn7Jaa	Sounds like he got his feeling hurt when you started talking to his friend. If you really like him and not that best friend so much let him know you are interested in him. Find a way to talk to him
8YDQnUZPaa	OOH intresting you want to be Popular eeh lol i joke    start talking to them about difrent thing wow u cant think of nothing?  go out to the movies with new friend and old friends|`|96InprHCaa	I always start with gossip, like "OMG, did you hear about..." blah blah blah
Z2EzfQFvaa	Umm..hmm..I'm not sure what to say about this.I get those feelings sometimes.Just relax and talk to some people.Got some friends with you?If yes then sit on a bench somewhere and chat and relax..or anywhere quiet.Don't feel angry,its makes things alot worse then you need.A proven method by me to cure angryness......here it comes.....is to dance!!!Yes..dance dance dance.That will make you feel better.Try doing something creative...umm..like take this for example...the other day I was feeling down...so I was being creative and I made a disco ball for my room out of glass...you can try little things..I'm sure you find something to do.In everything though..just smile...relax throughout your life..and chill back..when you need to be serious be serious..and laugh when you can..cus laughing is fun and it promotes good health :)|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well go out and talk to friends get to know people.|`|dbo3gjlxaa	You might just be PMSing?|`|40ObXE0caa	Maybe you should hang out with your friends more? Try getting a pet? Er......Thats all I got, good luck!
3i1vAIBFaa	that's not true. people can change for the better. it may be tough to realize that but it's true. im not saying he won't cuz nobody knows but him and the Lord but people do change.|`|EQDcq2IEaa	If he's cheated on past girlfriends, why would you think he would be any different if you were his girlfriend?|`|aVJ6Th48aa	forget him  if he has a history of cheating    who wants to be with someone that they're always gonna worry about whether or not they're being faithful|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	you should trust him, just because he cheated once before doesn't mean he will do it again, people make mistakes|`|YK5DhGryaa	Yes jealousy is a natural feeling BUT I cheated on my ex once. the only time i have ever cheated on anyone, whereas, my boyfriend has always been a cheater (and yes he has cheated on me through "phone sex" but never got physical). So it really depends on the person. I wouldnt recommend being all up in his kool-aid [[lol]] but i WOULD be careful. and talk to him, make sure its in a caring way so he doesnt think your grilling him|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	You could date him, but I would NEVER give him my full trust. There's always that chance that you will get hurt.|`|9cpcu9mpaa	In my opinion, yes once a cheater always a cheater. It's completely understandable that your not sure if you should trust him. To be perfectly honest, if you guys haven't been together for long, which sounds like you haven't I wouldn't put too much trust into him, I would be doubting him. If he cheated on his past girl, what makes you think he wouldn't do it to you? Be careful and good luck.|`|BjpsUzMOaa	well it's easy to tell if someone really loves you or not.    there are two people in this world who i actually love and who really do love me.trust me if your questioning your relationship,and if he loves you,than it's probably time for a change.when the right guy comes along,you'll know.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Who cares if he's talking to some other chick.  That's innocent enough.  You're the one with issues, not him.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	This is just my personal opinion, but yes, once a cheater always a cheater, I'm sorry if other cheaters don't agree with me, and I dont expect them to, but you need to understand that if someone can cheat, then they can always cheat. If you choose to date a cheater, with a player past, then you need to be even more suspicious and you'll always be worried, so you need to ask yourself if you want to lay awake every night wondering if he's thinking about someone else. If you think thats what you want, go for it, but you won't be happy. Trust is one of the most important things you need in a relationship, and if you don't have that, you really have nothing to gain in a relationship.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	No, save yourself the hurt and worry. TRUST me. I gave a chance to a guy like that and it was not worth it. Find someone you can have total confidence in. It's much more pleasant and enjoyable of a relationship that way. :)|`|4qSUqhNnaa	im sorry b ut the once a cheater always a cheater thing really is there...  if he had the heart to cheat once why would he stop..its in his nature to..  he doesnt mean to do it to hurt you  :/|`|sZePlWTQaa	I don't know if he will always be a cheater...maybe he cheated bc there wasn't a connection anymore with his gf and couldn't break it off? BUT if thats always going to be on your mind and bother you (it would me!) then maybe its best not to date him. You want to be happy and be able to trust him. It will only make the relationship harder if you are always going to be worried.
xw13XqNaaa	Ask yourself what is more important, your friend or Alex?  Based on that, do what you feel is best.  I would say stick your friend unless you are really in love with the guy.|`|xp0TzWSMaa	if you think that you and alex are going to a future tell her, if not break it off with Alex.
GKdgXDTbaa	I feel the same  Whenever someone mention even his name, I just get this weird feeling.  And something when we haven't see each other for a few days then I'm about to see him finally, I get so nervous and have this feeling like I feel sick or something. And maybe because I can't be with him too. It's just weird. I guess I like him a lot...  Well I think that's happening to you so you must like the guy very much |`|00A3BfSEaa	You like him.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	you're in LOVE|`|gew4KVFfaa	hormones honey|`|HRXTcAxQaa	i know, it has happened to me before. the reason is that the guy grosses you out and the thought of you two being together makes you really sad.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well it can mean either 1 of 2 things. 1.) You have an undeniable huge crush on him...or 2.) You dislike him with a passion. My guess is 1 but then again you wanna start crying so...2 could also work haha! Nah i'm just playing sounds like you really like this guy :) plus age doesn't matter I've liked some girls when i was 13..ain't no biggie, so good luck with ur love life girl.|`|YFKwT1owaa	Because you hate yourself that you aren't going out with him right NOW|`|nyJ9WVLfaa	Bipolar.|`|FnskUYpqaa	You have a crush on him?|`|zU1jHBvuaa	cus u wana get with him and you cant. ask him out or something. :) X|`|Q53LzFCpaa	maybe because u either feel violated or maybe you never had someone feel that way before if u had a hard life that can happen to you if u didn't feel loved before u can feel weird noing someone kares not saying thats u but that cud be the isusse.
5VOSM5dWaa	Hey! you should explain why you lied. Just slowly tell him i lied to you and im sorry and ask him to please let you explain. Be yourself I am sure more people would like you if you are yourself. Don't lie on these myspaces and things because it leaves you with a bad feeling. Tell the truth and if you lie and you feel guilty explain why and see if they will forgive you if they don't then let them be. They obviously aren't right for you i hope i helped you|`|8MrTBln9aa	Be careful you never know who you may be talking too.  Just tell him the truth, not that hard,  if you guys are supposely close then he wont mind.|`|TFmWXt4eaa	Seriously, if you guys are friends than he should understand. At first he may be a little irritated but friendships are all about honesty and forgiveness!|`|FljIic6Iaa	How long have you been "faking" it? The longer its been the less hes going to understand or want to talk.  You should probably just tell him straight out, and explain why you did it, and that your telling him because you want a proper friendship.  If you've been honest about your actual life then he probably knows you kind of well and he probably wont totally cut you off.  Good luck though, its a toughy|`|AA10455206	Honesty is the best policy.|`|VOLRhthLaa	Because you have been dishonest from the start he may not trust you if you admit to being a fake. Who knows, he may be a fake also. This is a risk you have to take so go ahead and tell him the truth and wait to see his reaction. There is no other way.|`|8YDQnUZPaa	thats really F*cked up tell him the truth email him a good email apoligizing to him|`|d4e024d7b3f74eb1482c6eb0dc7c3e74aa	just be true and honest|`|iDYuSAynaa	well, you should definitely give him your real myspace eventually. you shouldn't rush into it-- gradually ease yourself into telling him-- explain to him how you did not mean to lie to him, but you just were fooling around to see how much fun it would be to have a fake identity. and then tell him that you care a lot about him, so that you want him to know who you really are-- he WILL be shocked-- but make sure he understands that you meant no harm, and the only thing that you hid from him was your identity-- not your true personality or anything else, so you are still the same person. i would be SO TOTALLY shocked, but i would still talk to you. i hope he will be understanding, and if he's a good friend, he will understand. good luck!|`|xthjbUg2aa	SO YUOR PROBLY REALLY UGLY HUH IF YOU GOTTA FAKE MYSPACE...LMAO|`|pWXYQTh8aa	well first if he really likes you like you do to him he should understand. tell him that you made it and just everything you said here. hes should understand. who knows maybe hes a fake to lol j/k just wanted you to smile..well that's it and if he dose not understand to die over it that just shows you that he wouldn't understand you in the future well i wish you the best....i hope my advice helped you out... good luck|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Maybe you need to be straight with him and tell him. If he accepts it, you have a chance. If not, I think you have to accept it and not blame him for not doing so.|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	same thing happen to me   i made a fake page just for the  fun of it but u need to tell him..  because eventually he is   going to find out seriously|`|WAktMXaVaa	If he's as good a friend as he seems to be then come clean immediately.  The sooner the better.  Tell him you like and respect him too much to let an innocent joke go any further.  Stress that.  You know what I mean....like...'If I didn't like you it wouldn't matter so much" etc. For me,  I'd appreciate that right away and would think you respect me so I'd gladly still be your friend.
1awiFO6paa	yea it is kinda wierd ..  unless se has always been like that then that wouldnt be wierd whatsoever  but other wise i think u should talk to her and i think that is mean about the waste of money thing

ZJo3GHAbaa	If you never say anything to her some other guy will and then what will you do? It will be too late. If she stares back at you, make your move, the worst she can do is say she's not interested. Then you move on. I'm so shy too, so I know you're probably thinking it's easier said than done, but you have to think what sucks more... getting rejected by this girl or some other guy "stealing" your chance?|`|YPVLgV3baa	ugh.i know how that is...I just now a bf i've liked for ever a year.I never told him i liked him because i was to afriad to get rejected.  so i say you should go for it!  and if she doesnt end up liking you dont feel bad i've had the same too...((((((((((;|`|AONXdcOPaa	It is a VERY hard thing to get over your shyness. and just blindly going up and saying "hi" might just make you a target for embarrassment. (Not saying she doesnt like you or anything, but awkward silences, you know what I mean? XD) I don't know what to say. Be yourself, of course, and try to get to know her more. Chances are, she is just as shy as you are. And this is coming from a shy girl, so i know how you/she feel(s). lol|`|e1884e932807e2ae04ca848e7bccb863aa	She most likely will never be interested in you.  Shyness is not attractive on a man.  Forget about the girl.  I know it's easy to say.  You need to fix your shyness first.  Go to a therapist.  Shyness is a problem.  It is a very difficult problem to overcome.  People that are not shy... have no clue!  Dating is all about numbers.  Don't focus or zero in on one girl.  You have a lot of work to do on yourself.  So, be kind to yourself and really work hard on getting over shyness... it's a serious problem.  Once you get your shyness fixed... man the whole world will open up for you... you'll see dramatic improvements in all aspects of your life.  You need to attack this shyness problem head on.  I wish you the very best.  Don't listen to the monkey chatter in your brain.  You are good person.  Best of luck to you!|`|LFwtv0soaa	aww i feel ur pain same here... =[|`|kWBXSjHXaa	You answered your own question dont be SHY lol|`|yjINGSXCaa	text or myspace her first  or...  you could walk up and say hello    or ...  accidently bumb into her   =]|`|G85fgFDLaa	Just be yourself, but not as shy.

But just show her you like her and trust me me she'll like you. if she liked you once then no duh she can like u again!!!

There really is no other way to overcome it then to go for it. If you think positively about the situation, you'll get positive results!|`|ZLw6BDMcaa	well look at it like this: she seems to have moved on. but if there once was something there, there is still hope. just get over it and suck it up. you either talk to her and deal with rejection, or stay wondering what will happen. i mean, girls aren't very harsh MOST OF THE TIME so chances are she'll be nice too.    good luck !!! :D|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Dude just say hi to her, even if you stutter or mess up or w/e she's gonna be glad cause she thinks your nervous around her..and that means you like her!

Y5pDh9ryaa	its the little things he does like never texts you anymore, doesn't call you so much anymore or even doesn't fell like talking to you anymore but your hunches could be wrong maybe hes not cheating on you. you don't want to worry to much but really you can never really know.|`|00A3BfSEaa	If he never answers your calls never wants to hang out and ignores you.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	You don't know but you can't burden yourself with thoughts like that.  If there is no proof then you're good to go.  Don't think he is because it will infect your mind.  I had a girlfriend who cheated on me once (only once) and I broke it off with her.  I spent the next 12 years not being able to trust any other girls/women.  It really sucked for those 12 years and you don't want to turn out like that.  It was a very lonely time for me.    Hope this helps.|`|39ixfEIraa	Im a boy, first off u just have to trust him or ur just gonnna beat urself up...second if he has a myspace than make a fake myspace and talk to him as some hot girl google a picture....but i would just say if he isnt acting weird u are goodd....are u hott?? if so he isnt cheating lol|`|CA9OFT4Waa	do you have any reason to believe that he is cheating on you? if you do bring it up to him because it will eat away at you and ruin the relationship if you dont, but if you dont have any reason to believe that, you just have trust issues and need to realize that he is with you for a reason and probably wont cheat on you, dont throw him in the dog house if he hasnt done anything.|`|SG27rfSdaa	Is he open and honest? Or is he sneaky and secretive?  You'll find out in time.  Then there are ways to test him too. :)|`|SuD5CjGraa	well.............  try following hi.......  i read books like that where they follows and finds out the boy is cheating on the girl|`|kg6H6HDuaa	You won't unless he tells you     Pay a friend to hit on him lol|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	go through his phone asap.. dont let him catch you though|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Men are by nature lazy.  Give him what he needs and he woun't look anywhere else for it.|`|mQ3ku8y2aa	you wont but you need to trust him and know that if he loves you he wont cheat on you dont pay a friend to hit on him becuase if he finds out you did it he will break up with you guys like girls who give them thier space he isnt cheating on you he loves you leave it at that|`|3ijLQe5laa	if you ask him and he avoids the question. then you know he is hiding something. when someone loves you they will make you feel confident about the relationship. if he is hesitant to devulge important info like that then he may just be holding something back. or you could do like i used to back in the day>>snoop and spy!|`|HunSyQaSaa	you won't and if by some chance he was then he wasn't worth calling him your boyfriend.It's a win- win for you.|`|FiCl71flaa	A relationship  requires trust as part of the ways to build it. Unless  your boyfriend has cheated  on you during the time you have been dating, you just have to trust him. There is no way to know if someone you love is cheating on you unless you catch them red handed, they confess to it out of a sense of  shame and  remorse, somebody you trust catches them  cheating, or something happens to make you aware of this cheating. So do not rock the boat if there is no reason for you to do so. It is not enough to start snooping to find out if your boyfriend is cheating just because he is cute, or you feel insecure, or a lot of gals like him or talk to him. Remember  that you did not force him to choose you as his partner and you can not force him  to stay if he wants to leave.|`|uirnyVeuaa	I agree get a good feeling for the way you smell and when you give him head see if he's been sleeping with someone else.|`|SSnCjOsbaa	spy honey...SPY!!|`|CI8gqgyeaa	finger yourself and see what you smell like. then next time you give him head, you'll know if its you or some other girl|`|AA10155617	you'll never know, but if you have a hunch, then its probably right.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	well if have the idea hes cheating on you then you might have something bigger to work on. talk to him about your guys' trust. tell him youve been getting werid ideas lately and you just want to make sure you guys are good with the trust in your relationship.|`|NrWLNb5zaa	you wont know unless you catch him cheating or he admits it.

You have to trust him though not to cheat on you. Some signs that he may be cheating on you though, is he's changing, always seems busy things like that. Just have faith and trust him enough that he wouldn't do that. Good luck!|`|gNHRfHubaa	Unfortunately that's something us females never know until it happens. but in my experience people who think it will happen usually make it happen. jealousy and insecurity are the 2 guaranteed things to send a man into another womans arms. Be confident in yourself and trust your boyfriend to do the right thing, after all he has to trust you too.|`|MmIYDoGkaa	If he never calls or say anything start spying.I said spying not "STALKING".Ask his close friends see what he's doing and see if he's hanging out with another girl.All in all don't "STALK".|`|O0pYOOpAaa	All you women on here telling her to spy are WRONG! Do not ever spy. Just ask him and look at his face. Get a book on body language and then you can tell if he lying by just reading the body language.    Don't ever spy. You would not want her to spy on you. I don't spy on my girl and I don't ever want her to spy on me.    Spying kills trust in a relationship.|`|LGlaLcHHaa	Well if your boyfriend is cheating on you, you should confront him with the topic and see how he replys. Make sure you don't accuse him of cheating when you talk to him because your not really sure if he's even cheating on you. I found this great article on signs of a Boyfriend cheating and really think it can help.                         Cheating Boyfriends: Top 5 Signs of a Cheating Boyfriend  By Stephany Alexander          Are you involved with a cheating boyfriend? Find out the top 5 signs of a cheating boyfriend.          Cheating boyfriends leave many signs and with a little patience, and by giving him lots of time and space to cheat, you can catch your cheating boyfriend without having to hire a costly private investigator. We have compiled a list of the top 5 signs of a cheating boyfriend so you can tell whether or not your boyfriend is cheating. Remember to pay attention to details and follow your gut instinct. In addition, if you and your boyfriend havent clearly discussed whether the two of you are both monogamous in your relationship, dont assume he has just automatically decided to be faithful to only you. Maybe in your cheating boyfriends mind, your relationship isnt serious enough for him to consider being faithful yet. Make sure you are both clear on where you stand regarding fidelity in your relationship.    1. Lack of intimacy. This doesnt always have to be in the form of sex. It can be a decline of touching, cuddling, holding hands or kissing.    2. He cheated on his old girlfriends. If you can talk to some of his old girlfriends, by all means, do it. However, make sure to ask his ex-girlfriends in a kind and calm manner so they do not become defensive. A cheating boyfriend will usually repeat their behavior with their next girlfriend.    3. He avoids you. A big sign of a cheating boyfriend is when he makes up all sorts of excuses as to why he cant be with you because hes spending time with his other girlfriend. If he has to work late, stay after school, is always with his friends or co-workers more than usual, these could be the excuses your boyfriend is using to cover up his cheating ways.    4. He never answers his cell phone around you. A way to tell if your boyfriend is cheating is if he always turns his ringer off around you or walks out of hearing distance from you. These are big red flags he may be cheating. If he receives calls at odd hours or speaks on the phone in a strange manner could also be signs he is cheating.    5. He is irritable or criticizes you more. If your boyfriends behavior suddenly changes, there is a possibility that he may be finding fault with you in order to justify his cheating in his mind. That way your cheating boyfriend can say you drove him away because of your supposed faults. The opposite of this behavior is being overly nice, giving gifts and being lovey-dovey because he wants to keep his cake (you) and eat it too (his other girlfriend).    If you discover your boyfriend is cheating, seek support from those around you like friends and family. Dont get revenge by sleeping with one of his friends because it just brings you down to his low level and you should strive to be the bigger person. The circumstances of your boyfriends cheating will allow you to decide whether to leave or stay. It is very therapeutic to write down your anger, sadness and disappointment in the form of a letter or a cheating boyfriend poem. Allow yourself some grieving time and then get right back into the game of life by filling your life with activities that interest you.    Written by Da|`|IvIHA5K6aa	Ask?  Ask his close friends?  See what kinda girl freinds he hangs with?    don't stalk him cause thats just creepy|`|spkpQ2C2aa	you dont|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Cheat back.|`|Jwa3Znbfaa	your just being paranoid. If he was cheating on you he would break up|`|zx52rxJvaa	love is trust    but also blind    oooooooohohhhhhhhhh|`|ymAOyewwaa	trust me on this. get to know the girl if he hangs out with any other girls than you and then see if you can get something out of her lol. :)
UCKAiLN1aa	She is definitely showing interest. But aside from that, dating someone who is married is just wrong. Regardless if they married for love or not. Marriage should be respected. Find someone else.|`|m0IVQxG1aa	Eh, it sounds like she's totally after you for your money, probably thought you were a nice guy who was rich, she probably saw you pay your bill with a visa or saw a glimpse of it in you wallet maybe she's just hoping that you have a visa.   Don't count on anything, sorry.   try to find an unmarried girl who would like you even if you were dirt poor.  Good Luck =]
uKvr3ZjFaa	why not here  email me at crazybabe01@ymail.com|`|TV3aH15kaa	go to a club and look for a girl who is really drunk and say naughty things like 'nice legs what time do they open.' and take her outside in your car and f*ck her like theres no tomorrow. works for me|`|BZg5TFlqaa	RIGHT HERE BABY!! ;) lol    try a club!! :) go for the girl who is dancing on the dance floor like its nobodys business :)|`|AA10155617	go to a club for sure. find the one that everyone wants to dance with.
KEOWM6NOaa	well it depends....did he ask you for ur number or did u ask for his? did u get it from a friend?     call him and say hey its ______. i was just bored so i decided to call. what are you doing?    whatever he says    then tell him your favorite tv show is on...somethin that rele is on.    then ask him if he likes is..    keep the convo to 10 mins top...dont wanna seem obsessive..          hope i helped!
ODf41iN4aa	Relax already.  Become self-secure yourself if you're not already.  Just focus on being a good person & develop your own interests & find out who you are.      Aside from that, does she act really glad when you see each other? Now that would be good.  Does she talk things over like when you're together with the goal of getting to know you better? Again, that would be a good sign.  So far, you didn't say that she's superficial, so that's a good thing.  If she is superficial & you're much deeper, well, there's more to life than a pretty face.    Otherwise, look for Barbara DeAngelis' book, Are You the One for Me? It's a classic by now.  btw, if she's not the one for you, take it easy & trust that someone else will come along.  For the time being, I guess you can be glad that she wants the 2 of you to take your time & not push things & you can be glad that she's not overly needy.    I wish you the best.  I'm sure it touches our hearts that you care about knowing what's going on & what makes her click.  Happy Valentine's Day.|`|7XbXvsNHaa	i think its time to get a new woman.|`|r1cDHOsHaa	no i don't have experience WITH a woman like this. But I am a woman like that. Girls dont want to make their man feel the are needy, so they tend to give them their space because they like you so much. Now, I may be wrong, but it sounds like that to me|`|IG4A4nuDaa	I had one one time, and then I found out that the girl was being monitored by her mother. Its understandable, I just had to talk to her about ithttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|cl6r8cGBaa	yes sir! count me in, sometimes i like it when my girl needs me, i mean sometimes its a good thing.|`|ViNFT9RQaa	umm i AM a woman like that, lol. i can't stand those girls who think that if they arent attached at the hip with the guy it isnt love! I need my space, i know my bf likes his space. we have separate lives and we also have a life together. we respect each other. she probably thinks she's doing you a favor bc most guys get irritated by the girls that call them a million times a day. my bf's ex was like that, and he tells me all the time how much he appreciates me for being much more low maintenance! don't take it personal.|`|FiCl71flaa	You seem to be a confused guy. You can not seem to make up your mind if you want a gal who loves you and stays in contact or a gal who will not make any contact even if she loves you.  It would appear that you want a relationship at the same time you also act as if you do not want one. I will suggest that you consult with a  relationship therapist who might be able to help you figure out your confusion about your dating choices;to figure out if it is an ego issue, a control issue, or a power issue for you. I wish you well .|`|HfDHPbfRaa	i have that experience but with the guy being the low maintence role|`|egSPGgtpaa	Dude you are so lucky, because I have to talk to mine 24/7 and it can get really annoying.|`|wB6KFpVeaa	Maybe she thinks if she is too clingy you wont like her anymore ..|`|z05MDkRbaa	If you are feeling insecure tell your partner.  Sometimes just the admission and discussion can be enough to soothe your insecurities.  Calling all of the time does not mean that she loves you. It could mean that she's thinking of you, or that she wants to make certain that you are thinking about her, which speaks to insecurities.  Some people just need their own space and time. How long have you been together? Do you want someone that is needier, or someone that is more affectionate? These are two different things that we often confuse.     Again, just be honest.  And remember to talk about you and how you feel, not to blame her for making you feel a certain way. Keep it as a conversation, not an argument.|`|sNvF6KPbaa	You are so lucky, just be patient when it is time to spend more time together gradually you will.  Chicks are cool who have their own time and just give her enough rope to hang herself.  If you find out she is living double life or doesnt like you then it will surface eventually then ax her.

2YICeD3Laa	awww!!! this is the exact situation I'm in. Except I'm not dating the guy yet, but I hope it'll come to this. We're just awkward crushes at the moment x)  Anyways, just go for it. Look straight into her eyes and smile. Lean in slowly and give her a few slow little kisses. When she opens her mouth, follow her lead. Use tongue but not too much. Ask her what she likes. good luck!|`|J5Mevbz7aa	goooooooo for it buddy|`|ANC7G909aa	go in for it nd then just go w/ w/e she does|`|mIvVWFdmaa	It'll come naturally , just start|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	just let go

cLDbxtARaa	I have a great sauce for you  its a white sauce|`|zDeFibxzaa	store bought sauces are good,there are many recipes on the web you can look up easier than i can type it for you so there !! and oregano is an herb,not a spice but an herb.next time you go to the grocery store look at the herbs,if you can find them,lol,sometimes they are hard to find but most store have them,but you can buy fresh herbs like oregano,celantro,etc,etc.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Use more beer.|`|jm2ppj62aa	how is this in marriage and divorce that really doesnt make sense|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Here hon, this is all stuff that should be in your house and it's pretty easy.  And yes, oregano is also a spice that should be in your house.    INGREDIENTS   2 tablespoons olive oil   3 cloves garlic, minced   1 teaspoon dried basil   1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes   salt and pepper to taste     DIRECTIONS  In a large skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until tender, 2 minutes. Stir in basil and crushed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and cook 15 to 20 minutes, until slightly thickened. Serve immediately|`|4EesoL2xaa	Oregano is an herb.  Its good.  A very simple sauce is this:    A medium can of crushed tomatoes.  A medium can of tomato sauce.  A tiny can of tomato paste.   Put all that into a big pot, like a big one.  Not just a regular pot, I mean like a big one.  Keep the flame very low.  Put in about 3 tablespoons (soup spoon size) of oregano.  If you have fresh garlic, put that in (1 clove), otherwise put in about 5 tablespoon of garlic powder, not salt.  If you can get fresh basil, put in three or four leaves, otherwise put in a teaspoon (smaller than the tablespoon) of sugar.  This will cut back on the acidity and not give you heartburn.    You can use the sauce as soon as it heats up, or you can let it cook forever.  Its simple, and its good.    If you want to really get fancy, get 1/2 pound of ground beef or 1/2 pound of meatloaf mix and brown it in a frying pan.  Don't burn it, just brown it.  As its browning, sprinkle some garlic powder, salt, and pepper on it.  Then take a spoon with holes in it to scoop out the meat after its done, so that you don't get all that grease, and just plop it into the sauce.      I learned how to make that when I was 14.  I still use that recipe.  Its not the best, but its actually pretty good.|`|8PvqsOt8aa	Prego is your friend, do not try it on your own!!!|`|vxjOpKruaa	Yeah try prego.  or try:  Basic Tomato Sauce Recipe   Ingredients:  ~2 Tbsp olive oil  ~1/2 medium onion, finely chopped  ~1 small carrot or 1/2 large carrot, finely chopped  ~1 small stalk of celery, including the green tops, finely chopped  ~2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley  ~1 clove garlic, minced  ~1/2 teaspoon dried basil or 2 Tbsp chopped fresh basil  ~1 28 oz. can whole tomatoes, including the juice, or 1 3/4 pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped  ~1 teaspoon tomato paste  ~Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  Method  1 Heat olive oil in a large wide skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery and parsley. Stir to coat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened and cooked through.     2 Remove cover and add the minced garlic. Increase the heat to medium high. Cook for garlic for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, including the juice and shredding them with your fingers if you are using canned whole tomatoes. Add the tomato paste and the basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a low simmer, reduce the heat to low and cook, uncovered until thickened, about 15 minutes. If you want you can push the sauce through a food mill to give it a smooth consistency.    Makes 2 1/2 cups of sauce.|`|AA10455703	oregano is a spice. yes you add it to sauce but a more important spice to add to sauce is basil. basil and tomatoes are practically married and have to go together. making a homemade sauce is rather tricky especially for a first time cook. i recommend buying a can or jar of sauce and you can add some spices to it like basil parsley and oregano along with some garlic. good luck!|`|gw30AoiDaa	If you are putting your answer in Marriage and Divorce, then maybe you shouldn't be trying to make sauce.  Being able to read and understand are a big thing when learning to cook!|`|RSczEcZCaa	Try this one that I experimented one Saturday afternoon. I just looked at what's available in my pantry. Sautee 2 tsp minced garlic and 1 large chopped onion in a skillet with 1 tbsp canola oil (or olive oil) and 2 tbsp butter until translucent. Add the store-bought sauce (a lot of spaghetti or pasta sauces are available in groceries like Del Monte's), 2 tsp of dried basil, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 10 minutes until it slightly thickens, stirring continuously. Try playing with other spices and herbs like yeah, fresh oregano, fresh basil and parsley.There are a lot of recipes for sauces so try different ones till you find the one that you really love to eat. Cooking is a trial and error thing, just enjoy it!
apufwtUAaa	anything, what dose he do, talk about that, seee what he is doing o the weekend, ask if he wants to go to a movie or something, and actually talk in person.    if you really like him you may aswell go after him cause chances are he really likes you too.|`|ma1zKpdpaa	ask him questions about himself... they love talking about themselves usually. if you actually know him ask him out for coffee or to like the local park and bring some mates (both of you) so you can get to know him comfortably :)|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Ask about a film hes seen recently. That way you can find out what he is into. If its something like Underworld you can tell hes into fantasy stuff or something like Frost/Nixon would let you know hes into politics. Then you can find out who he went with. It could be Family so you could find out if he has brothers or sisters and how many. If its a book that's been made into a film you can see if he into reading. It just can lead onto many conversations. Maybe even a offer out on a date! Hope this helps.

Go get her|`|3c32eaf91139f0812d413dfb6485098caa	Well its obvious she still has feelings for you and enjoys to have you there for her. Maybe with the hard times she's going through, she doesn't really have a mind to re-establish a relationship with you at this moment. Be patient and understanding with her, and let her know you're there for her for whatever she needs, even as a friend. Letting her feel that she's not alone and she has you, will bond you both even more.

AA11542500	If he really loved you, why would he cheat?  He doesn't really love you if he's cheated four times.  He probably knows that you'll be there for him and by the way you're sounding, he's right.  He could probably cheat on you again and you'll still be there.  Now you have a choice to make, put up with his cheating or stand your ground and have some respect for yourself.  You deserve someone who will love you in the same way that you love him.  You've said it yourself, you've given him many chances already and he's thrown them away without even a thought.  Why waste your time, effort and emotions on someone so not worth you?|`|40HpQquSaa	don't go back with him hes just gonna break your heart again and your friends are right. and if that nappy headed boy loved you then he wouldn't cheat on you 4 times!Be reasonable and don't keep going back into the lion pin cuz your just gonna keep getting bitten!!!!!!|`|klcqgST9aa	Take him back if that's what you want, but be cautious. Tell him you won't tolerate his cheating, and if he does one more time, than it's over for good.     You don't deserve to be hurt so many times.     But, people can change, so I say give him the chance, and if he cares about you, he'll make the right choice.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Tell him that if you go back out with him, he cannot see any other girls. If he does, then sweetie, he is going to make you have a serious heartbreak in the future. If he agrees to not cheat on you anymore, then give him another chance. May God Bless you in this situation. Good Luck.|`|EAApPFvKaa	Don't do it! He CHEATED you FOUR times. you already gave him lots of chances! If u go out with him he'll do it again and again!

You need to let him no where u stand ! x|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Once a cheater, always a cheater.  I hate cheaters.  I had one girlfriend cheat on me too.  She was the most beautiful girl I had ever dated in my life but she cheated on me.  I broke it off with her the moment she told me.  It took me 12 years to get over it.  I didn't date at all for those 12 years.  It hurt me too bad but I can see you're a gluten for punishment.  I think you need to leave him for someone who won't cheat.  He's gotten away with it 4 times so he knows he can come back if you let him.  He's pegged you for a fool and if you take him back then you deserve what you get.  Sorry to sound so harsh but like I said, I hate cheaters whether they be girl or guy.    Hope this helps, you have my sympathy.|`|3ijLQe5laa	as the old adage goes, once a cheater always a cheater|`|G1sEBPQkaa	4 times? Let me guess, after each time he apologized and said he would never do it again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.    Stand strong. If you let him take you back, he won't change. He didn't change the other 4 times, what makes you think he'll change now?|`|AN9PdKmgaa	move on you do not need a guy who cheats and once a cheat always a cheat. can you trust him? if not you will never be able to feel comfortable in this relationship|`|DfRD02n2aa	i understand exactly what your going through, ive been in almost the same exact situation. i suggest, you talk to him about it. i know youve probably done that before, but if he really wants you, tell him he has one last chance, or its his loss. its hard being in love with someone that makes you feel like they dont love you back, but he most likely does :} some guys just cheat to make themselves feel good. ask him why hes cheating, or what you could do to make up for all those other girls.     i hope i could help, believe me, i know how you feel.    best of luck!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Hang tough. If you go back with him, he will think it's a green light for him to act anyway he wants and you'll put up with it. I'd give him the boot and stick with it.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Please, break up with him. He's just wasting your time, I mean 4 times he's cheated on you. That's a loser for sure, don't let yourself get to attached to you, because obviously this boy wants to be a wannabe " player " and hurt young innocent girl's feelings. So, yes if you have his number call him up and say that " it's over" , if he don't like it to bad tell him. I agree with your friends, lose him before it's too late. I hope you haven't had sex with him sex, because he's just using you and any other girl that he's messing around with.    I hope you think about what I said, he's not good for you. Find yourself a better boyfriend that'll care and be there for you. Because the boyfriend you have now is a joke and is still a little boy. I think it's time that you found yourself a real man sweety.     If he tries to hit you or anything just call the police and have his *** locked up.    Don't EVER take him back again. You will definitely regret it in the end.    Take care !!!    Joseph D :)|`|FiCl71flaa	What do you love about him? Here you have a boyfriend you have been dating for just 3 months and he has already cheated on you 4 times plus you  indicate you have given him many chances. Do you really need anyone to tell you what to do in this instance.

If he cheated on you 4 times in 3 months he will probably no doubt do it again. I personally believe that once a cheater always a cheater. Breaking up, is never an easy thing weather your being dumped, or dumping the person. If you loved him, well of course it will be hard. Don't go back to him, you derisive way better then someone who's just going to cheat on you. To help get over him, hang out with your friends, cry it really does help. Talk to your mom, your friends. At this time though, don't stay friends with him you need firm ground. Good luck!|`|sZePlWTQaa	Don't go back!!!! There are soooo many more men out there that will treat you right!

There are so many other guys out there, I promise you'll get over him.  Are you absolutely sure you love him?  There's a huge difference between love and infatuation, and I'm willing to bet that your feelings towards him are ill-fated.  You only want him because you don't have him and couldn't have him when he was cheating on you.  The only way he can learn his lesson is if you don't go back to him, otherwise he'll think it's okay to cheat (which is probably why he did it four times, even though you forgave him).  So forget about him, and find someone else.  There are so many guys in the world, and that "one and only" crap is such BS.  It's all about compatibility.  Find a guy who's not a complete douche, and you'll be so much happier in the end.|`|XkRGEnL4aa	if he's cheated on you 4 times, give it up.  seriously no guy like that is worth your time.    and he's obliously not the right guy for you if that keeps happening.    the sooner you end it, the better.  you don't want to get in too deep!  hang in there.    and if he says he wants you back..  make him SHOW you how bad he wants you.  make him prove it.  then you'll know if he's worth your time|`|cq3FtZCuaa	Mmm, once a cheater, ALWAYS a cheater. if he cheated on you 4 times within 3 months!!? i say leave him. he is NOT worth your time. its jus that your prolly blinded by love. dont regret breaking up with him..he get what he deserves. he is no good. i say move on to bigger and better things..or people. lolol (:|`|Y755UOhMaa	4??

He cheated on you 4 times -.-|`|oBLfCideaa	kahra.. or whatever your name is..  don't give your *** to this assho.. wait.. this yahoo.. so.. forget that last word..    he says he loves you.. we all know that..  but he doesn't seem to be commited to you..  he doesn't realize how good you are to him..    but really the best thing you need to do..  is ask yourself..  do you really want to give this basta... freakin.. i keep forgetting this is yahoo..  so uh do you really want to give this guy.. who has cheated on you like 4 times, another chance.. to just break your heart again?..    kahra.. or whatever your name is..    do what you know you should do.. for yourself.. not for him or anyone else.. but for you..
uRxgTXSYaa	seriously?  four times and your really asking this question?    well rather you love him or not.. he CLEARLY doesnt love you..  not to say he doesnt care for you.. but he definitely doesnt respect you!    If you go back to him after knowing what hes capable of and MOST LIKELY to do.. its totally your fault if he does it again and you get hurt.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.How can you love someone who has no respect for you whatsoever.Today you made a wise choice.Tell this romeo "If you were the only boy in the country.I'd migrate to a warmer climate".You've hurt his ego by dumpimg him. Hurt him more.Forget the creep.
eO4y3m1maa	I don't get what your asking?    On your computer? or like a public computer?    You can print out documents just by right clicking the document in the folder and choosing it on the drop menu...|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Confusing question.Do you wish to leave no trace or evidence of your transaction?.Then try the local library.They though probably have the same system.
atCP6jrGaa	Don't freak out about the specific details of her letter. Just that she wrote it says she likes you and would like to try dating.     It sounds like you like her as well, you don't have much to lose here considering you barely know each other. What's the harm in saying yes?|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Go for it, man.|`|3l7IkyX4aa	Dude go for it.  but be friends first before anything official.
1m9988e1aa	its ok not to date at your age i felt the same way you do now.    1. first date- 20 yrs old  2. me and my girlfriend asked each other out  3. i am a crossdresser and it turns my girlfriend on when i dress up for her  4.i was in the band for 1 year then switched to drama for 7th and 8th grade so band not bad at all  5.use a link for facebook just because of your age.    there is nothing wrong with waiting though. i graduated high school and was working a full time job when i met my girlfriend the first one i have ever had and hopefully the only one i am going to ask her to marry me in a few months. i had friends who were dating in middle school and if you ask me its just too much drama from everyone involved. oh and my girlfriend is 28 and im 20 so dont think you have to ask someone your age you can ask older or a little bit younger but i would wait on asking younger girls until like college or maybe high school its just too weird in middle school.|`|bfxhpsvzaa	1. My first date - 16  there was no point in going out before then because neither of us had part time jobs or transport and hated scabbing money/lifts off out parents  2. I dont care who arranges the date, take it in turns if you like?  but if i feel like the guy/girl i want to go on a date with isnt going to arrange one first, ill take matters into my own hands.  3. i could never go out with a cross dresser.  it would freak me out so much :/  4. depends on the person, i dont really care if they are in the band, just aslong as they arent obsessed with their instrument..  5. link it|`|8b4d5c25104d41c4a03183a70e462703aa	Ya, so we are pretty much on the same page!
GhML3DyIaa	Yeap we do like the kind that are bad for us, especially when we're young and haven't learnt our lesson. Sounds like shes a dumb *** anyway going back back with him so why don't you move onto someone who knows your worth before you waste any more time goofing off about this girl?|`|dMTx6QRaaa	are u that ugly?????|`|TMi1GhSHaa	because when your in love with the RIGHT person you will just know that its right. Trust me. She probably felt that way about her ex. People do change you know. shocking. but true.|`|1s6mQJqOaa	Because life is unfair, people who do not deserve the girl get the girl! I am sure you are fine, and handsome, just know life is unfair. Good luck!|`|uFJXz1x3aa	ooo ur hitting that phase    honestly,,, when stuff like that happens, you just have to let it go =/    like i know that exact thing happened to me in the summer    and you know what i did    i said  F*ck it !          and then she regret her decision, and wished she chose me      its because we guys are supposed to have back bone    were not supposed to cry over anything, because its pointles    and sooner or later were gonna laugh at ourselves for    being so dumb about it lol          everybody has stages like that in life, and my advice is that u say F*ck it, and turn your back    because sooner or later ur gonna forget about the whole thing and realize u wasted your life crying|`|AN9PdKmgaa	some girls seem to enjoy being treated badly or maybe she was just using you until she got her ex back. Anyway you are better off and soon you will meet someone else hopefully better for you. Here's a hint for the future             ;if the girl spends a lot of time talking to you about her ex and even saying how badly she was treated chances are she is still hung up on him|`|nG63KSMgaa	You sound needy and far too eager to please. Girls just don't find that attractive.|`|s4xDhjrVaa	love hurts. i was in love for 8 months. and i ****** it up.      but EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON! but theres no one better for you....theres someone PERFECT for you!|`|q9LxIdJzaa	love wouldn't be what it is without a little challenge..  it proves that you truely care and really do love her/him.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	If she's with someone else then and she loves him then there is nothing you can do. It just seems like you're a guy who has never said that you like her and barely speak to her.     Grow up!|`|AA11015078	because sometimes one person loves the other far too much and the other is too busy being loved to love back    it hurts mostly because your heart and your soul are in it and when u are rejected, it cuts deep into your heart and soul.    most times ppl love what's not good for them, it's just the way it works, want whats bad for you|`|kG3AfXvsaa	Love hurts because unfortunately it isn't true with most people. For example, most people, when getting married, say "for better and for worse" but really only mean for the better. However, some people can actually grasp the concept of true love. It is true when regardless of what changes occur it remains the same.  Yes, you will find it. Your time will come. My time came, and it has since left... but it will come again... eventually. I think we just have to wait a while and go through a bunch of **** before we can be rewarded. I went through **** before my ex boyfriend whom I really loved, and he dumped me... now I am going through **** again.  She gets back with him because she doesn't think she will find anyone else. If she knows your interested in her then she is either not interested in you that way, or just loves him still even though he may treat her like crap. She probably feels alone and unsure.|`|3l7IkyX4aa	Dude forget her man  she screwed you over move on.|`|5WB2yZUFaa	ummm... love doesn't hurt... losing it does.   there must just be something about the guy she can't let go of.  so it's good she went back to him. you should be with someone who is gonna be all yours! yes, you will find love, probably when you stop looking. i wish you all the best, and i'm sorry you're hurt right now.

She has a child in grade 10 but you are still having a prom.    WTF?!    You mean she has a relationship with a boy in grade 10 ?
TMi1GhSHaa	stay friends with him, i gurantee he and his gf will brake up.. maybe not now but sooner or later they will. In the mean time dont put yourself in misery, date other guys as well, have fun!!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's best to move on.  If he has feelings for you rather than his girlfriend, he would break up with her and be with you.|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	imagine u are they girl he is dating and there is another girl who likes him..how would that make u feel?He is clearly with the girl cuz he had some sort of feeling or attachment for her and chances he will probably not leave her for u. maybe he jusy likes flirting with u.|`|KCKq9duJaa	wait till they break up
1b3123e2cfaff1916a441241e17352ddaa	make him a cd of songs that you like or songs that he think that he'll like.  its pretty creative and heartfelt.
Wlh3b2vXaa	well i dont know how old you are, but she probably does like you. either that or its one of those girl group crushes. I would talk to her online or in person, and just ask her about whos shes intrested in and stuff, she might tell you she likes you...is not, tell her|`|QsV9Vcbxaa	well if she is looking at u and she laughs about things that arnt jokeing laughs then she is flirting with you and she prolly likes u and she wants u to notice her. ask her out and see what she says.|`|MU6y2lBQaa	Well, i personally think that she likes you back, but the only way knowing is asking her. :-P Good Luck!
MVmfY6ptaa	u cant love some1 rite now u just strongly like her... + not all ppl get butterflies some ppl feel different when they like some1|`|Nj58Vi62aa	The butterflies will go away eventually when you get more comfortable with eachother :) best of luck|`|5YEKmHqyaa	It's hard to say.  But honestly, the butterflies are a good thing.  I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and I still get butterflies if I haven't seen him in a while.  It just shows that you care for them a lot and are still interested.  It doesn't mean that you don't love her if you get butterflies, it just shows that you're into her.      But trust me there will be a time when you get comfortable with her and you can just be you.  When my boyfriend and I were first dating I would never eat in front of him.  I just hated ppl watching me eat.  But now, I don't care lol.  It will get better.  Good luck!!|`|123z7Ww3aa	I always get butterflies when im with a girl i like... Well sometimes.|`|STB7HLZ6aa	no because you are a pu$$y like sidney crosby|`|KJxwNfsaaa	You just contradicted yourself while asking that question  Can you love someone but not get butterflies  Just really really like being with her ?!  Love & Like, 2 totally different things.  im gonna have to say you really like her thats it.  cause if you love her, you wouldnt be asking if you can love someone blah blah blah|`|JswHEJGcaa	of corse you can, that just means your comfortable around her.
bMuwuAVOaa	Well all I can say is: If you think you are in love you are, even if but for a moment. it all seems the same when you get down to it. However that being said only true love lasts forever. Example: I thought I was in love with my first husband, it felt like love for 5 years. he cheated on me so we broke up and he became a person that was different from the one I loved. it was and is OVER. But I fell in love with my high school friend Tony he's great and all these many years later I still love him. Although we are married to other people we still deeply care for one another. I met and married my wonderful husband and we are happy together and have been for 14 years now.   It is hard to say how you will know the difference but you will. But believe me it does take maturity to see the difference. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|3l7IkyX4aa	love at 13 and 14  is not real.  I swear I thought I was in love with this girl at 14  but now I look back i wasnt in love.|`|RJynYf6aaa	he is not in love with you. none of your friends are in love either. your 13.    sorry i cant tell you what its like to be in love i wouldnt know...|`|fDGlC403aa	You can't eat or sleep and you are not sick .... just lovesick. You think about them constantly, whenever u are not on the phone with them. They fill your every waking and sleeping fantasy.|`|efvcP4dVaa	teenagers in love is VERY short lived. at that age, only looks and popularity are your judgment. you might want to wait a few years before you prance around claiming your in love. find things you love and takes those reasons and apply it to a relationship.|`|mW39emMdaa	ur heart tell u, u'll have a diff feelin|`|UI79JnJVaa	"They just Like the attention they're getting   from their relationships."

IG4A4nuDaa	I think that he was joking, and leading you on. Its hard to believe, but some guys just want to know how far they can go.

4VhOi6hvaa	You need to stop really liking him. Its really kind of incestuous that he would even consider it. If he doesn't consider himself your man then get your self out of there. Everyone thinks happiness is found with another but its found within yourself first. You have to love who you are before anyone else will. You deserve someone who is committed to you and if its not him then maybe it needs to be you. Its hard to be alone, but its harder to keep looking for approval elsewhere, you'll spend your life miserable with people who have the same amount of respect for you that you are having for yourself by being with him. If thats you in the profile pic, your sisters not the only beautiful one. And it only takes one person in 6 billion to think your the most beautiful woman in the world. You sound like a clever girl with a battered self esteem, its only hard to gain your confidence and put your foot down the first time, after that you'll be flying! Know your worth girl! You deserve the whole world and you can have it too, but don't expect someone to give it to you, only a few are that lucky, you go out there stand up proud and get it your self. Dump his little ***, he's a user. and theres 3 billion more to pick from. You really want to spend the glorious days we're given on this earth on worrying about somebody who treats you like that! Hell NO! Please, please listen to me, don't follow my footsteps and throw away 5 good years of your life!|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It's not that you're over-reacting its just that he went about the matter in a disrespectful way.  He does not sound like the guy you should be with anyway, the two of you didn't have a serious relationship but there was a mutual agreement that there was something between the two.  I suggest you leave him and don't talk to him, as for your sister, warn her, theres nothing you can do after that.  If you persist to down talk him to your sister when she doesn't believe you, she'll take you as being jealous.|`|FUFD3MhQaa	Kick him in the nads.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	he's a jack@ss|`|tM35loy4aa	Hi I say just get rid of him. If your his girlfriend or dating I think he just use you or mess with you and not take it serious but I say he's not the right person for you.|`|MRijAWJRaa	he is probably joking, my boyfriend does that to me to try to make me jealous all the time|`|1XcTZRemaa	Jeez! He sounds like a jerk to me, I'm sorry. No guy should tell you that he likes another girl, much less say that she is uglier than her and accusing her of being selfish. :[     I think you should just say to him, "Do whatever you want, because I don't want to have to deal with you anymore." Of course, you don't have to do it so harshly, but seriously - this guy is being really rude to you.     As for him and your sister hooking up, just forget about it. They can do whatever, but don't let it affect you. He's not worth your time, sister. :]|`|IG4A4nuDaa	owww.. I think that he sees you as friends, or is judging your reaction. Either way, I don't think he is for you.  Just a gut feeling  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|1dSEu6ZJaa	MURDER YOUR SISTER AND RAPE THE GUY. WHAT A COINKIDINK I HAVE AN ATTRACTION TO MY TWIN SISTER TOO|`|PvwZdLuLaa	No! He's an idiot, and not only should you tell your sister to stay away from him, so should you. Any guy, especially a "boyfriend" who would tell you that your sister was prettier than you is a loser. And any guy who would not understand why his "girlfriend" would be uncomfortable with him dating her sister, is a stupid loser and a player. You're not being selfish, he's being dumb... guys sometimes man.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	1. "I don't understand if I am his girlfriend"...well you're clearly not.  2. You're not being selfish. I don't have any sisters but I can totally understand that this would bother you.  3. He said that she was prettier? don't go out with him again, he's a jerk...I don't care if it's true or not.  4. I guess you can't make demands to him and even if you did he wouldn't care....but you can definitely make them to your sister (in a nice way, it's not her fault).|`|MCN7gdI8aa	not make demands? are you kidding me? he told you your sister was prettier than you!! send him straight to hell, not worth your time!... be happy because he is complimenting your sister while calling u ugly?? show no remorse.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	No do not consider yourself his gf. If you two have formally agreed to concentrating on the degrees, in his mind you guys are friends with benefits. So I would keep myself available for other people, and I would see other people simoultaneously. The sister thing is very disrespectful, because he knows you like him, and he knows that it would bother you unless he is just stupid (he probably is). So I think it was really shi**y of him to throw that in your face. He's a guy so he probably thought "oh we're not together, so I can act how I want and say what I want and not have to consider his feelings." I have a feeling this isnt the first time he has been rude to you and I take it if it were your way you would be his girlfriend, but some how he got you to agree to "focus on the school" then after this its going to be "focus on the career" so my point is this is an excuse. And anyone in their right mind has to know that if they make a comment like that to the person they are informally dating, regarding their sister/brother, they know what impact it will have on that person. Last, people have compared you and your sister and that can be an ego blow if someone prefers her over you, but you need to build your self esteem up to the point that you can sustain your confidence regardless of what others prefer. I think that was really below the belt what he did, and if he feels the need to date your sister or even mention he is interested in the idea, you should move on. Probably easier said than done, but you know that his behavior is not going to change any time soon, the only thing that will change is his excuse not to be with you! Good luck, you deserve to have what you want out of a person.|`|GoEaSOSraa	Screw him, he obviously doesn't care about you. Now, if your sister goes and starts dating him then you and her are going to have a problem. But guys are a dime a dozen, so don't even dwell on it.|`|SyHmExgtaa	That is by no means funny. I find it beyond offensive, it's down right disrespectful and I would not tolerate this bs for one minute. I would tell that insensitive jerk to keep his worthless a** out of my face. The end...|`|tLY2jFUxaa	Deal with it.|`|NGk5IrWWaa	he's a real douche, you dont need that.|`|n7BuH75gaa	i think you should move on.  you could do a lot better.  have your sister clear far from him too.  what a twat|`|39dc0136161bb58b8ec044a212a6fe8eaa	Stay out of it and play flyff|`|WNB4Vojsaa	focus on your schooling. relationships are not for everyone.|`|LFoHH9Noaa	he shouldnt mess wit yo sista|`|C4WZpghIaa	yea get over it your sisters hot and your not and he dont like you.|`|JdO5DN62aa	i would tell him that you are kind of uncomfortable with hat because if you cant hav a serious realtionship together bc of school they why is he deciding to date|`|gmYEF4qNaa	Puh! I would leave him in a second!|`|hIxQTwK3aa	well let your sister have him and move on to another man that would be the best i think|`|rvZDVxGfaa	He sounds like a loser! I would dump him, and date other guys! If you let him get away with this then he will continue to walk all over you for the rest of your relationship.|`|hwVy3FfPaa	u need to tell him wats up and let him no that he is with U and not  yo damn sister and if  he cheat on u beat his black butty  ok girlfriend|`|NKXrJlm7aa	guess he's desprate cause cuse ur ugly|`|ejeBrOpuaa	Don't worry about it happens to me all the time with my cousins that are gorgeous but one day you ll find someone else and he will think your sister is nothing so yea don't worry about it|`|654CKsm9aa	I'm sorry, but I don't think that it's a relationship at all. When you're in a relationship you never say that someone is prettier than the person you're going out with. And you especially don't date their sisters. So, get out there! Or he will say and do stuff that will hurt you even more.
zGDyQfdYaa	Sweetie, don't plan too far ahead. Right now you're a just a chick who gave it up a bit too easily so yes, I guess that puts you in the "booty call" category at the moment.  If he decides to see you again, then maybe you can re-assess things but as I said, don't plan too far ahead.    P.S. You ARE a hoe...........but I love chicks like that!! Why can't I ever meet more women like you?!?!?!?  :-((|`|dCmSA6r2aa	it might develop into more but you can't know because you gave it up so quick you were a booty call and if he returns it will probably be for more booty|`|NEw5dsJlaa	just wanted to say hi to another LP!! and stop sleepin around lols|`|QAsgyfsNaa	you gave it up to soon.  your nothing more than a booty call!|`|G3Q21MDCaa	You a hoe for sleeping with him...j/k.  More than likely, he's gotten what he wanted, but for some odd reason us guys think we have to wait a day or two to contact a woman after a date...don't want to seem to eager.  My best advice is to wait until a relationship develops before sleeping with anyone that you might want to have something serious with.
IK5PoN4Laa	A good thing to know is what did you do that could have made her loose her trust in you?  If you think she thinks that you were using her, prove that you are not using her and you really do love her.  Do nice things for her, talk with her, be open.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	It will take time but in the mean time dazzle her and show that you are really into her.|`|DbNbWQflaa	stay with her 24 7 dont have roaming eyes and sign a notarized note, with a promise , and a big iou if you go back on your word,|`|EFXT4rj2aa	wow. thats a horrible feeling. it guna be cerry hard. just be there for her when she needs you and do unexspected thing. things that you never done before that you know she likes. let her know how much you care for her.|`|7XbXvsNHaa	she's oviously hurt and doesnt feel like breaking the wall that shes built up for so long.

It will take time and life to build it up again. It will take patience and understanding on your part and forgiveness and openness on her part. There is no quick fix or band-aid that can mend broken trust. I urge you to listen to her, remind her of your commitment to her, be careful of how you talk and joke around her, and clean away any destructive habits you may have. It will just take time, my friend.    Good luck!
CdGNZxLTaa	Usually when a person is a bully it is because they do not have happy lives. Often they have unhappy home lives and issues that they don't talk to anyone about. It is no excuse but for what it is worth your bully was probably a miserable soul.  Don' touch the guy! As a black belt you should be familiar with the rule that karate is a last resort. You could simply talk to the guy. Small talk. When he hears how successful you are , he will know that you made it. He might even be sorry for what he did to you. My guess is that he wouldn't even think about raising his hand at you or so much as looking at you the wrong way. ( even w/o your black belt)  Don't let something that happened so long ago control you. Life is too short to let others control how you feel and what you do.  Oh well, I wish you the best.  P.S. Thank you for your service to our country!|`|qqrOwOEQaa	I am sure you feel like ripping him to pieces, but before you do that, just think about why he probably was a bully, I bet he was in secure, or had a hard life as a kid, so he thought that the only way to express himself was to make others feel pain so they could know how he felt. I am sure he has changed, and I suggest that you do what YOU think is right. I have not been bullied before, but i am only 12, and who knows what could happen. But I think you should pray, and ask GOD if he has a way to calm you down. It is ok that you feel angry, but we need to forgive people, so just give my advice some thought. I hope I helped! Good luck!!! :) :) :) :)|`|dCmSA6r2aa	hmm maybe for what was done in your past|`|W1aYIF71aa	Hmm....maybe because you are a loser who can't get over high school garbage?|`|AA11553416	It would be best to forget the past with this guy.    "For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind."  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson|`|jpAzVmG0aa	I think you're letting this pile up on you. Just let go. For all you know, he could be dead or poor. Losers like him get nowhere in life and most likely he regrets what he did back then, just as your feelings come back to you, he might get that guilt.

A doctor or school guidance counsellor. Perhaps they can help you feel better about things and move on.|`|xZOHlSXsaa	Let him down gently - this should work because if he is into you then he will understand.    If he persists then tell him outright that you don't want to get into anything with him but I wouldn't do that to start with.    It's interesting that you don't like him because he's nice but anyways..    Hope this helps =)
KrHYU3dzaa	If it hurts while he was playing with you,    he's incompetent and did it wrong,     Guide the fella by exploring yourself so you know what you like !! ??    However if you have sex for the first time,    its not uncommon for it to hurt but it wont be unbearable,     so don't be scared,     just enjoy it it will be your first you'll always remember it     its fun enjoy it !!!!    maybe use some lube, think lube could be a good investment|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Oh its gonna be terrific for him... for you on the other hand well I suggest finding something to bite down on.

Stop stressin, relax, lots of foreplay an go with the flow|`|8LzZvPwjaa	I don't think you are ready for sex...not with these kind of comments...and if he just fingered you for the first time the other day I really don't see why you're in a hurry to have sex....but anyway, the tight thing might be a problem for you cause it will hurt...but I don't think it will be a problem for him cause guys normally like tight...oh and it might not go in easily...|`|Sb5LEsmPaa	i think it'll be good if he said u'r tight i think thats a good think i said it because i think he found it exciting...good luck|`|gJE0ujbzaa	The last thing you need to worry about is whether it will be bad for him!  He's not the one risking his life.  You getting pregnant will make a mess of your life, and you will actually be risking your life to carry a baby full term.    If you go through with this, please please please go on the pill at least a month BEFORE you have sex, and use a condom as well.  If you are embarrassed to do that, or are too embarassed to go to the doctor to get on the pill, then you ARE NOT READY FOR SEX!  You have to be prepared to act like an adult and be responsible-because you are risking becoming a parent.  Not to mention that since he has been with other women, you are risking catching an STD from him if he's been exposed. there's no way for you to know for sure he hasn't, unless he's tested clean twice over a six month period, and hasn't been with anyone else.    If you have decided you are going to do this anyway, and have taken the right precautions, now what you need is to be ready.     It sounds like you aren't turned on enough.  It's going to take a lot of foreplay, and you need to want it.  He's very young and not very experienced, and he may not know what you need to be turned on.    If you have never masturbated, you don't know what you need either. If you think "ewwww" about that, again, you aren't ready for sex!  You might try that on your own a few times, and find out what feels good to you.  then you can guide him as to what you need.  If you can't communicate about these things with your boyfriend, then you aren't ready for sex!    You need to find out on your own what you like, be able to communicate that to your boyfriend, and be prepared by being on the pill and having condoms. If you don't know what you like and can't communicate it to your bf likely what will happen is your first experience will be quite painful and not nice at all.    Virginity is something you can lose only once.  Don't be in a big hurry to get rid of it.  Don't make a date for it to happen. Take your time, and let it happen when YOU decide you want it-not when your boyfriend decides it's time.|`|WiBOrXUCaa	Nope  nothing is wrong :)  your so tight because your a virgin and that is normal.    its not wrong for you to do it if you're ready  but it will hurt pretty bad im not gonna lie  :]|`|vchYXsQ0aa	NO!   Wait until you're totally ready to have sex. I'm 16 and I lost it um at the end of November this past year. It was with my boyfriend (we're still together) and I love him very much.   Make sure you do a lot of foreplay to get used to the stimulation before you go ahead with it, please! It hurts if you don't have enough "experience".  I'm not trying to be one of those people that just judge, I'm talking from experience. But it is your choice in the end.  Whatever you choose to do, be SAFE!|`|dI8i6RKraa	Tighter the better in all honesty.

824Md65waa	The first step is just to relax and have some fun.  Obviously you want to make an effort to be a gentleman.  Be sure to open doors for her, help her with he coat, etc.  It never hurts to offer up a compliment as well, but don't be over bearing.  A simple "you look really nice" is always safe, but lets her know you have taken notice of her appearance that evening.  Whatever activity you chose for your date, be sure to keep the conversation flowing and not too heavy with super serious questions.  Take the time to learn more about her personality while giving her a better sense of who you are.  Like I said, just have be relaxed and go in with a positive attitude.  You can't go wrong :)|`|22EVxBYWaa	aww wel u should deff compliment her, but not so much where its creepy. also, act really chill, mellow, cool, and smile at her alot and if things are going well, like after you just made her laugh or something, kinda casually hold her hand as you walk to remind you that your focus is on her. also, ask questions, but remeber not to like, interview her cuz i know i dont like that. also just remember: be friendly and be polite and just have fun

XMXgeJPFaa	tell him ASAP.  I personally think it's a waste of time if you let him think you might be interested by not saying anything.  He needs to know and you need some space.  Just tel em you dont like him that way but you wouldn't mind being friends or something.  I hate it when its obvious I'm into a girl and she doesnt say anything.

vAt3Zqj9aa	your very young so this should be easy.  women at your age don't tend to play games, mostly because they don't know how.  the best thing for you to do is to spend time with her in school tomorrow or as soon as you can,  if you haven't seen her for more then 20 mns recently then she will be weirded out if you all of a sudden want to take her out on a date.  once you do that, get her on the phone.  by this point you must be flirting with her so make sure that you are always flirting because if you don't she will turn into your friend.  i know this may sound difficult but, when shes in the caf eating with her friends, its the best time to go and give her some attention.  not only will she see that you are confident(girls love confidence more then clothes) but she will be the envy of all her friends.  o ya and make sure to say hello to her friends after you say hi to her though of course.  if u need help email me
Y9yRGPpLaa	I'd tell him off, he's invading your privacy and im guessing it offends you, so i would straight up.. tell him him off something like "Oh my god! Just leave me alone! If all you spend your time is just trying to bother me, then you must have NO LIFE AT ALL! Oh, and ya might wanna lay off the Twinkies there.." and i would do it in a very public place so he would get VERY embarrassed and maybe you would get props from some people who that kid is annoying aswell ; ) Good Luck with you situation|`|sdt7vPSoaa	Whenever your by him, make an excuse to leave or talk away from him|`|rxScdXM4aa	tell him as politely as you can and tell him that you are going to call the authorities.    he has no right to be in your personal space|`|SorcFv62aa	just tell him Quietly to back off|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Get a schedule change or tell your teacher its not tattle tale when the dude is super annoying and he's acting like a total child wonder what grade he is in|`|PSyVB2UDaa	I'm sorry but this sounds really bad.

It happens all the time.  It's a sort of infatuation type thing.    All you'll end up doing is wasting precious time on this enthusiasm.    Also try not to get too manic about it.

aXOyK3uBaa	That is a LIE. There is no "shortage of men".     That's other women PRETENDING.    We are here -->> but we are just not interested. Don't forget to include the possibility that not all you girls DESERVE a good man.    Many men are finding out that women consistently FAIL a cost/benefit analysis in marriages and relationships.    Read the paperback: "The Cultural Devastation of American Women: The Strange and frightening decline of the American Female" - by Nancy Levant.    That will answer your question perfectly.    And the interesting thing is that THERE IS NO SUCH BOOK ABOUT AMERICAN MEN.    ? But there is a book called "why men love BITCHES".  ? And "why men MARRY Bitches".    Why??? Because BITCHES actually think they deserve a man.    American men are universally considered "the best in the world" because they are - by law - required to be PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.    American women are universally considered the most spoiled, selfish, arrogant women with a unbelievably off-the-chart sense of entitlement.

All that other stuff about not enough guys... well, perhaps you just haven't met the right fit, but there are guys all around you.  Later on in life though, women do tend to live longer, so when you're an old lady, there could quite honestly be a shortage of men in your age bracket.    Anyway, good-luck finding your match. =)

xHy7ZjI8aa	the best way to tell is when you're in a large group of mostly girls. if he talks to you the most, laughs with you the most, lightly touches your arm when he speaks to you, looks in your eyes and really listens when you talk, you catch him looking at you when you're looking away or talking to someone else. those are all really good signs that he likes you. if he hugs you for longer than a few seconds, looks wistful when he has to leave, texts you within two hours after he says goodbye, tells you he loves you (i know that that's kind of a no duh but alot of my really good friends tell me they love me all the time but we're not romantically involved) many times during the day, tells you good night and to have sweet dreams...it's the little things...

If you don't want it to happen again keep your clothes either in the right hamper or have your own separate hamper. Give up the fight. Not a big deal.|`|urLDcX0Jaa	1st off,  If you know she doesnt pay attention to detail, why would you let her wash ur clothes?!    2nd off,  RELAX, its NOT THAT SERIOUS!!!    Lastly...  Be a big boy & wash ur own clothes...or at least the 1's you think have sentimental value...even if its a $65 Izod shirt! ;]|`|bIimm8fSaa	Actually, it would be her fault.  Whoever is doing the laundry is the one that should sort the colors.  Tell her to be happy your dirty laundry is at least in the laundry hamper!  I have to go to my husbands side of the bed and pick all of his up.  Including under the bed.  Hey!  There is an idea.  Leave them beside the bed and then she will have to pick them up and she can pick up the whites all together.  Then the colors.  Then whatever else.  Tell her you are making sure they are sorted for her.  All jokes aside, I always sort everything piece by piece and I feel it is my job to do so.|`|QOJEFXHAaa	It is nobody's fault. It's called life. If it was a gift then who cares how much it cost. I'm sure there is a clothing monogram place that can make you a new one just like that one. This mistake/accident is nothing to be so angry and hateful over. The world is not going to end because of it. You are married! Come on! It's JUST a shirt. Move on.|`|MKEbLKnFaa	w0w. Switch the situation,  What if you had accidentally threw her shirt in there?  Forgive dude - its a shirt. She is your wife!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Oh my god, does this mean you are going to have to go in to work shirtless?  If that happens most likely your bosses secretary will seduce you in the ladies bathroom and your boss will fire you for violating the dress code and his secretary on the same day.  Your wife will therefore be 100% to blame for causing you to violate your vows and destroy your career all in the space of one day.      Holy **** she is one powerful woman.  Hey, wait just one minute here pal.  If she is that powerful you better not piss her off.      In fact you really should go hug her and tell her you are sorry for making a shirt more important that your marriage.|`|bV7yfxpKaa	OMG you're right!  I'd sue for a divorce immediately.  The nerve of that woman to ruin a perfectly good shirt.  How could she be so careless?  What's next?  Dinner?  You could come home and she could be burning a perfectly good dinner that you worked your fingers to the bone for man!  I'd have her flogged.  Get a clue.  Have you given her lessons on how to fold your stinking laundry, too?  If your that snotty, do your own blasted laundry and stop whining.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Unless you have separate hampers for whites and others, or she said "don't put anything but whites in the hamper," hers.    I'd be ticked.|`|AA11967247	your wrong for wearing a stupid izod shirt. go replace it with a new members only jacket.    yellow?, that just makes it worse. the shirt, that is.  i would of done it on purpose just so you wouldnt wear it anymore.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	forget the shirt and move on.    this is really a non-issue.    you liked the idea of your name on your shirt.    if you feel that strongly about it, go to an embroidery store and have your name embroidered on a shirt.    kiss the wife tell her you love her, weasel some out of her and move on.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	dude it was an accident grow the hell up and both of you get over it|`|AA11538662	No one is at fault.

You're married not in high school.   and if you're mad at her for that then you start doing the  laundry..|`|AA10886262	in the big scheme of things, you know LIFE, a shirt that a vendor gave you is not a big deal.....don't be a right-fighter and you will live a long HAPPILY MARRIED life......|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Gee- What a terrible problem- I hope that you and your wife never come up against a real problem- You would never cope.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Your fault for not doing your own wash....    Izods are gay anyway (not that there's anything wrong with that)|`|NqMmvvgVaa	What about all the loads of washing she has done for you without you thanking her for it?   This is one shirt that got ruined, these things happen and you are taking it way too seriously. I am sure she didn't intend to do it. You just put it int he hamper assuming it would get taken care of, because apparently you think that is what a wife should do.  Get over yourself!|`|aXYiOskmaa	oh boo hoo. it's a stinking shirt. it's no one's fault so get over it.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	I would bet next week's pay check that she really and truly didn't have any intention of ruining your shirt. Shame on you for trying to find out who is at fault.    If you think more of a shirt than you do of your wife - you have some bigger issues than just this.     You should take her in your arms and tell her you love her and that you're really sorry for being such a stupid jerk - and making such a fuss over a shirt.     Oh - and mean it, too.
mcUSz16kaa	You've got to be kidding to post this ...What are you a baby/toddler..Yes, it's a problem.  Peeing on yourself is not only  unsanitary (especially for what you do), it's disrespectful to yourself and to others that can smell you.   Pee smells bad and is highly acidic. Hosing yourself down isn't cleaning it out of your pants. Take the time and go to the bathroom.  Wear some Depends if you can't find the time to go properly.|`|1mtjvp6aaa	If your Boss will let you go smoke he will let you go pee.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Nah its fine as long as its not somebody elses urine|`|ZlC654Dkaa	That's wrong on so many levels.  It's unhygienic, uncouth, and just downright disgusting.|`|igvu3ifUaa	i sure am glad that your joking.
EgtLRxswaa	Nobody is perfect, but the guy would have to be good at sports, kinda smart (not a nerd), cute, funny, stylish, romantic, and blushes at the cutest times. :)    i dont think theres such a guy though...|`|W76Lzh3caa	No one is perfect. =]|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Yes there is I personally hate when I am mad and a guy babies me.... I like him to comfort me but I am a girl not a baby..... but being very sweet is a good thing for yuo|`|DrEXU5Ozaa	guys that are a little too nice give me the jeeper creepers  i like my guys to be a little aggressive  and touchy|`|l8dmvDOnaa	It doesn't matter what sex you are too nice is good depending on the person you are being too nice too.  If they take advantage of you being too nice all the time, well their the wrong person for you to be hanging around.  You want someone that sees past that and likes you for who you are not what you will do for them.      No-one is perfect, if we were it would be a very dull life we lived!!|`|uZTzird4aa	nobody is perfect. everyone has flaws, and they are part of what makes up who we are. flaws help build character (as well as talents and abilities).     i don't think there is "too nice" because you dont want a person to be mean necessarlily...but i do find people who try to act perfect ( even though they're not) kind of annoying. It's ok to let your guard down a little. you can't bottle your flaws up inside of you, it's just going to  end up in an even worse breakdown. It's good to be kind, but it's not good to try and act like you're better than everyone else and that absolutley EVERYTHING in your life is perfect. because it's not true..and whoever that person is...is not fooling anyone.|`|cNQpldWmaa	Nobody is perfect ..|`|losGznxMaa	sometimes i wanna do things for myself (like carrying things ect.) but there usually isnt such thing as too nice...|`|PtUJNBFRaa	No. I love boys that can sometimes seem to be "too nice." And really what is perfection? I don't believen it lol no one is perfect.|`|0vHXdvaLaa	what is your question exactly?|`|uojIfxaoaa	yes there is such thing as tooo nice, cause when you're tooo nice people walk all over you. no one likes a pussy. and NO ONE is perfect|`|WEpGEwhxaa	A lot of girls are different, but I like really nice guys.When you're really nice, most girls recognize it and see you more as boyfriend material. But sometimes when guys joke around meanly, it's easier to flirt with them. So I think it'd be better to be somewhat in the middle. :]
iL4TYr21aa	I think you are worrying a little to much about the situation. Just because he isn't constantly looking at you, doesn't mean he doesn't like you. I understand where you're coming from, and it's very aggravating not knowing. It may be difficult for you, but if you really want to know why don't you try talking to him? Just casual conversation. See what kind of vibe you get from him. If it feels like you guys click, then maybe there's some potential. Or if you already talk to him often and your friends, think about the conversations you have and what impressions you get from him.  Really, try not to stress, just be yourself.  I hope everything works out for you.|`|I7K2mX6laa	that means he likes  u in the first time then after few days he found another girl to stare.|`|JDcL4p6Yaa	hmmm, i guess it depends... do you know this guy? if you dont i would just say hi, and just see how he responds.|`|S0XRVANDaa	well it sounds to me he is the shy one he is waiting for you to make a move so talk to him see what happens|`|mHZvOhsDaa	haha i feel the same way, im a guy and like looking at the past it goes up and down with the girl i like.. i guess the bestt hing to do is talk to him, thats what i did and so far so good for me. but im still very confused and lost..    go up and introduce yourself :) just looking at people doesnt mean much, its called people watching and sometiems we do it out of boredom, but if he was staring at you he likes something about you. so go up and say hi, im _____ what was that mr. _____ was talking about today? it just went right over my head     something casual.     can u help me?!|`|IG4A4nuDaa	I think he gave up because he doesn't even see a hint that you are interested... show it if you want it  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|V2rNq3omaa	he probably got embarrassed or feels like a creep ,and doesn't realize you like him also. You should say hi and smile, I bet it would make his day.|`|lkRnJ64haa	i dont know..  it seems that you showed no interest at him while he started at you..  like while he started at you.. you sholdve smiled or something..  Any kind of hint at all..   He probably got the hint that you dont like him and moved on..  if you do like him that start staring at him and smile when you make eye contact|`|hSB2rP9Waa	Who knows why he was looking at you in the first place?  It could be innocent curiousity or it could be that he likes you.  You really have know good way of knowing until he tells you what's he's thinking.  So just go work out or talk to a friend and don't worry about it.  If you want to talk to him, then do it!  If he seems interested at that point, great!  If not, at least you won't be thinking about it so much.
50WCN0graa	Well, it sounds like he is noticing you, however, you really can't know that he likes you yet. Wait and see if he "singles you out" or treats you differently from other girls.|`|aOcfAdevaa	Well valentines is coming up...give him a hint|`|ScJmxZf7aa	If somebody is flirting with you that means they do have some interest in you.  I would suggest asking him to a party or something and seeing how he reacts outside the classroom.  If he still flirts with you the same way he does in class then you should have your answer.  Hope this helps you out and good luck.
99QUdtkzaa	You can talk about anything. Just imagine he is one of your friends that'ss a girl. Ask him about classes, or what sport heplay'says, or anything random. Try and make him laugh so you can make little sarcastic remarks or just tell him something funny. If your talking on myspace it gives you extra time to think so you can ask him what he's doing but make sure not to ask too many questions because it could be annoying.
daTpsnKVaa	ehehe I'm 16 and I love Tom Hanks since I was...10 something like that...  We're not weird, just the others are all the same!|`|IPS3hWweaa	Its not too weird. I know a lot of women who date guys who are older because the ones who are younger are just immature. Crazy party boy Frat guys come to mind when I think of guys in their early 20s, not all guys are like that of course, but it isn't too far off the mark.|`|zprAkP3eaa	No not really, most young girls like mature guys just not that mature.|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	nope, im a few years younger than you and im attracted to 20/30 year old men.  :\|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	well, I'm 20 and I'm more attracted to women in their mid 30's. I really don't know why. I'm pretty sure the mental maturity has nothing to do with it for me. So my answer is it's not weird.|`|Sfim65Deaa	I don't think there is any thing wrong with that so you like older men 30+ we don't consider our self guys were men I see your point guys your age are childish I know I was once 18|`|H0Immui8aa	Your legal. Its okay.|`|ZcuMp7CXaa	You like mature men, and I'm sure they would like you...|`|Pswqhimoaa	Well, a lot of guys at around 18 are immature.  If you wait a few years, you can find one who is mature enough for your taste. ;)    I wouldn't suggest a 12 year difference. So much has happened in that long of an age bracket it might be kind of hard. but hey, if you can get it to work, it's legal !|`|60NJNjEpaa	as long as your legal and you use protection, there's nothing wrong with it.  age ain't nothin but a number...|`|mRQ6D0Ipaa	hahaha your funny! your going to be like that famous anna nicole person because she dated someone eighty.... trying aiming for twenties then it won't be wierd when you are kissing someone with grey hair and a beard|`|XKhNw221aa	Biologically, you are at a ripe age to birth children, therefore your body is attracted to those it knows can provide for your children. So it's not weird.|`|cd79bc55584f59c7b466769fea7b719aaa	No, not weird, but possibly dangerous.  Any 30 year old interested in an 18 year old is a predator.  Fresh meat, so to speak.    In a year, you can be at college, where you might find a 21 year old who seems way more mature than the boys you are used to.    Stay away from the 30 year olds.  They will cause you nothing but heartache.|`|lKYU03NLaa	no not weird at all,  seems to be the in thing and i have no problem at all with it.  However it amuses me to hear that people think its wrong and immoral for an older guy like 30-40 to like girls 18 to 25 simply because older woman can be so complicated they have forgotton what its like to be fun and care free  older woman can be so childish if you no what i mean lol.|`|7sxGW40qaa	No, it's just what you said, you don't like the childish guys.|`|aV4LZExiaa	Nothing wrong with that...If it wasn't for chicks like you the porn business would be hurting!|`|Sb9cGCkHaa	im 24..... and id love to date u :D
JDQP0Phraa	Think hard about it first. You obviously broke up for a reason. Make sure you actually want him back and you're willing to overlook the problem that made you break up in the first place.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You are both too proud and pride can be the prevention or death of relationships. If you want him back swallow your pride and ask him.|`|TxgdMUvLaa	I'm not trying to be mean in any way. JUST ASK. It's okay.. I had the same issue.|`|KkHtAQEmaa	just talk to him, who cares who asks first. if u really love him u will go and talk|`|1Kxxwjjdaa	ask him out|`|jChbnuafaa	if you really want him back go out for coffee and lay out you feeling and then he may ask you and if he doesnt just ask him your self dumbassssss! jeez|`|SlOU6v3Zaa	swallow your pride|`|ThNYBYf7aa	It can never work out if one of you dont get off ur high horse and face your reality. Time is precious, act b4 another girl steals him away and leave you single which really sucks|`|CUc2gqzjaa	just ask|`|MkM5rtwlaa	Just talk to him about it and then if it comes down to it just ask. its ok for girls to ask.|`|mxq7EEskaa	well if he really wants you he will be calling you or something.....try talking to him.|`|hSB2rP9Waa	Well, if both of you are too proud to ask then you don't really love each other as much as you think.  True love is willing to face humiliation in the pursuit of a relationship.  That doesn't mean you should lose your dignity, though.  If you are the one who made the mistake then you should go after him.  If he made the mistake and broke up with you, he should go after you!
k1FenuRLaa	let him catch u staring at him and when he looks look away then look back and make sure he catches u again|`|rPwHPKv5aa	go up to him and say "I have a crush on you" and laugh about it|`|DCIPrG1gaa	Maybe you could actually say it, a lot of guys would probably appreciate your honesty and your openness and willingness to not make him try and guess your game. He might not a relationship, but take the risk if you're interested in that manner because I'm sure watching him go with other girls can't be too fun.
V0muobgFaa	Just keep practicing.  time may be the best remedy here.  perhas one reliable friend can give you feedback.|`|AEAS7A9naa	Talk about what you have in common!  If you've never met them ask what their name is and their interest and what not.  Hope that helps,  Robin
ySP0sr90aa	my best advice would be swallow all your shyness and go flirt with the girls, ask them about something that their interested in or something like "hey do you know/like this band" or something like that, that way the worst she can possibly do is to say no. girls love it when boys talk to them and they dont have to go up to you and say something, the best way to get a girl you want or to even start talking to a pretty girl is to flirt with her first, cuz it will get easier the more you do it!!!|`|wsAlc3vhaa	if you think talking isn't really your thing, you need to master eye language. you need to learn how to communicate with the girls you like by looking at them from a distance. here are a few tips:    - this is important for this approach to work: dress nicely. get a couple of somewhat tight-fitting, long-sleeve dress shirts. dark blue and red are the best colors. wear them over a casual pair of jeans and skateboarding shoes. you can get artistic with the collar of you like; leave it unfolded/messy. leave the top button undone, but only the top one.     - try to make your hair look good. experiment with hair styles and a mirror. try not to use gel products if you don't have to. you can shave whatever facial hair you have if you think it's gonna look good.     - sit in the caff with good posture, never slouch. scout the surrounding tables for fine ladies. once you've landed on a girl you like (and you know she's single), start looking at her. give her one of these nice, gentleman smiles, all the while gazing into her eyes. if she looks back and smiles or plays with her hair, then BANG. next time you see her, say hi. mention that you noticed her in the caff. ask how she's doin. offer to walk her home. don't talk much about yourself. you can try this in the hallways, but only when the girl is alone.    - if you're walking down a hallway, and you see a bunch of girls walkin the opposite way, give them one of these smiles while walking confidently. it'll get em talking about you, and one of them might approach you later.     this is pretty much guaranteed to work, just give it some time. respect man.|`|TZeKta4haa	be as nice as possible and flirt' GETCHA SEXY ON' LOL
ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	it is possible, but that happened to me....like forever liking each other and then he finally did, and it was a pretty long relationship..so it's not necessarily true.     peace     Btw....life in technicolor ii (and number one i guess) rocks huh? ;)
fj9rFzZAaa	Yeah what the first chick said|`|KmzgpValaa	don't think you can if you were not answering his calls and he kept calling anyway...think you might just need to be bold and tell him that he needs to stop cause you don't want to be friends
RWsTvypoaa	Well first things first, guy will always remain immature, especially about things like this. But on the bright side that means he's not cheating on you because you two haven't been having sex so that means its even MORE on his mind than normal. You know your boyfriend so you can decide which works better...but either you can make sex jokes back or something everytime he says something, like "thats what she said" and it will piss him off. However, if he'll just get more enjoyment from you doing that, then you just have to have the talk again and be like "I know its not a big deal for you but I really don't like it and it ruins the thought of sex for me"--he wants you to have good thoughts about him and sex in your mind so saying this will probably give him the general gist that you are not joking around.|`|WGebRhqyaa	its your not kind of humor & you should let him know you dont get it or like it. tell him you dont mean any offence & you arent a prune or anything you just think that's mature of him to constantly makin sick jokes.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Maybe you shouldn't use those type of words ;)  Just talk to him about it, he's your boyfriend you'll probably have to tell him a couple of times before he actually stops!|`|tSYB11xdaa	Just come straight out and tell him that what you say is not appropriate or something like your a PIG kinda in a joking but serious way. He will hopefully understand that to you its not funny.|`|Fd02NWmhaa	for guys everything revolves around sex. its the main thing in their mind. just tell him that women are not that way and u feel insecure when he makes everything that way.  tell him that there's emotion involved, not only sex   and btw, tell this really seriously.|`|KNJjZJJOaa	i am in my senior year of high school and that honestly sounds like 90% of the freshmen at my school, he should be more mature than that and all you have to do is explain to him that you dont like it and tell him that it is a major turn off for you , he will understand and you will not sound like a jerk|`|x6xOlJfmaa	Uhh don't say dicked to him?|`|SsGLm3Xvaa	You should talk to him about it, even if you already have once before.  Don't tell him that part about 'he should be more mature', because even though you're right about that, it will only make him defensive and less likely to take in anything else you say.    Just, when you're not around a bunch of people, tell him that when he turns everything you say into a sex joke, you don't like it, because it ruins your idea of sex, and whatever other reasons you have.    Just remember to speak calmly and maybe a little bit softly.  If he feels like you're attacking him or accusing him (even if you aren't), he's not going to change.|`|ATxbz7IXaa	Well, you started it. It's probably of the things you said. Maybe try changing your style of talking. If he still doesn't stop, you know what to do :)|`|z7MIZdaZaa	okay this is so wierd! i am 22 and my ex is 29 and he did the same thing to me.     the way i see it is like this;  you are 6 years younger than him. when you guys are out together he may feel intimidated by the age difference. if another man looks at you, he may feel threatened. or if you have never dated someone his age before he may feel, well, old! the way he shows that is not uncommon. by making sexual references he may feel like he is acting more "age appropriate" its a way he feels younger and more immature than he may actually be.    my ex had only been divorced a little over a year when i met him and had been with his ex since hs. so think about his current relationship status and his past relationships too! maybe he is just being immature as a way to relive his younger years. maybe you make him feel young again and he is subconciously acting immature.     he may also feel like he cant keep up with you (in the sack)! are you more sexual? more aggressive? maybe honestly hes not as attractive as your past boyrfriends and hes intimidated?    i dont really know the situation but i do know from expereince and can guarantee it has to do with the age gap and past relationships! i woudl approach it like this;     "i just wanted you to know that i care about you so much, there is just something about you that makes me feel so special! I dont care about our ages, it has no effect on the way i feel about you." or something along those lines, just make sure you always say something positive and heartfelt before you are asking them to change somehting. Also know that a guy can only change when he feels like somehting is his idea and you are not accusing him of anything or directly giving him an ultimadum.     for example: "i feel like ever since we started having sex you have changed, i want our relationship to be meaningful and real and that includes our sex life.  when you make sexual references or jokes it just seems to downplay that special feeling i get when we make love(or however corny you wanna be). It makes me feel like im dating a teenager again, and thats not the kind of relationship i want to build on. the reason i fell for you in the first place was because you had a certain aura of maturity that i loved but lately i feel like thats changed...yadda yadda yadda"     once again (im serious) make sure you talk him up and build his ego, tell him hes amazing and perfect and than say that the sex isnt what it used to be (in whatever words you chose) and tell him that hes acting like a teenager and you need a stronger man than that.  oh...he'll change    sorry this is so long girl!    if all else fails, just start becoming unavailable to him. Dont be at his beck and call. Just go out with your girlfriends and spend some time alone, and he'll get jealous and worried that you may be giving up on the relationship.     guys get jealous about things like this and if you have already told him how you feel, than after a few days or so of ignoring his calls just tlel him say, u know i dont know if this is going to work for me anymore, our age difference never bothered me before but something about you has changed and i just dont feel like dating someone who reference sto sex like a high schooler. lol low blows to the ego work well too : ) j    you know how he is and what type of guy he is so use whatever you think will get to him better. and trust me it will work! if you want more advice im all ears...ive been through a lot and im not trying to brag but i can pretty much get what i want out of a man... haha its the P power im telling ya...    ...good luck|`|IJmvLnlVaa	Just tell him how you feel, that way it shows your really serious and concern...........and also the sooner you address it, the quiker the  problem gets solved.|`|5tqh0akYaa	he sounds immature......... tell him to knock it off|`|1XcTZRemaa	He's a guy; he's being immature, and he's most likely hinting that he wants to have intercourse.     If you want to let him know that it's bothering you, just say something like, "Really? More of those jokes? What are you trying to say?" Let him know that they bother you, and that he can just be straightout if he wants something.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	you brought up  dicked.where do you expect a mans mid to go?|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Have you seen the office? Reminds me of Michael Scott and all of his that's what she said jokes.   Maybe he is just that kind of guy who gets a kick out of silly humour.|`|TNNSHdypaa	lol why would you say "dicked over" to a 27 year old guy who has not had sex in a long time...you're pretty much catalyzing the remainder of the joke.|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Cause hes being a twat. Sounds like the Tod of scrubs. If you play on it a bit like saying...    "do you talk about sex all the time cause simply you can't do nothing else" or after his comment above you could have text back "I'll be honest you need to pratise to make your self better than you are at the momment".    Saying sex comments makes him feel superior. Best thing to do is to twist his words to make him sound inferior.    Also If you tell him it turns you of after he makes comments like that. He'll stop. Hey I know I would!    Hope this helps.|`|IG4A4nuDaa	talk to him, its easier than it sounds.  Give him the little kid routine.  Worked with me  answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|a0cc26d8f66caee6bd1830dc6e4c87baaa	LOL first of all if you dont want some 1 to make a sex joke you NEVER say things like     "dicked over"    Im sorry, but you set yourself up for that one haha|`|0zieKCK6aa	Point 1 he's a guy  point 2 You can't change the "Man"   tell him seriously that this really bugs you and he needs to grow up... Or and i leave that to you|`|9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	i think thats the only way he's going to listen if you do it dramatic|`|fV9SawuPaa	Lol, your reading into this way too much. I'm a "perv" to my girlfriend all the time, lol. Not because I'm a sex addict, but because that's my sense of humor. I'm 19 and so is my gf, and we both share sort of a perverted humor. So I guess it works for us. In all honesty the guy sounds very jokey and fun loving. He probably isn't doing it to be an ***, he's just playing around. If he does it CONSTANTLY though, and it bugs you that much. Just nicely mention it to him, and he should stop. A lot of us guys have pervy senses of humor, that's why you women love us :).|`|Z76MXWsjaa	Be firm...make a witty comment yourself.   him: *sex joke  you: that's funny because you're a long way from doing that.    You cut him off, he'll get the hint.|`|YmLcF2rSaa	Don't be nonchalant but don't be loud.Tell him you really are bothered about it and you want it to stop until the time and place is right.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	A guy who is 27 is telling crude one liners?    The guy must have an insecurity problem.    In a calm but direct voice. Just say the jokes have got to stop and that they make you uncomfortable.|`|9Vffg27Haa	tell him straight up and that is kind of weird|`|3BhPab1Oaa	guys never really grow up|`|KPKv5hwqaa	every time he does that look offended and say ur a pig! It will work.|`|3QG6WLXXaa	tell him how you feel|`|ZCxwtU3Haa	just say it in a sad voice:  "can you please stop with the sex jokes all the time, you take it too far, and it bugs me sometimes."  -- but be calm with it!  * it should work :) & if it doesn't then make it a big deal.|`|vepZ2wOWaa	its really disgusting and immature  it might be funny at first but it WILL get annoying!  whenever he makes a joke like that, don't laugh.  just make a whatever kind of face. you know
zjp17TZcaa	Life is too short. just ask.  you dont want to think about this time wondering what would have happened.  women up! and do it.|`|W1eWuBiuaa	trivial. stupid problems. go save the whales.|`|suoY5vxbaa	Okay, i would ask him if he was going with anyone else then if he says no, ask him if he would like to go with you. But do it quickly because someone else might ask him!! Good luck!|`|cgRaJIx5aa	Take a risk. If he says no, no harm done.|`|GORu3NJkaa	ask him! :) if u don't have the courage then ask someone else
k5zdt7MMaa	I definetly know what you mean. I've done stuff like this before. It'll blow over soon. But it is like omgembarassed for a little bit :p
7bT8AAiiaa	Yes, you should definitly take a shot at it. If you want to impress a girl, you just need to show bravery and ask her. If she rejects you, don't take it personal. You should just say okay.You shouldn't use notes, it shows you as a coward.|`|9GDBpl8Faa	Just be like, "Hey, do you wanna go to the movies this Saturday with me and a bunch of friends?" If it's a "group" date, she'll be more likely to say yes.|`|kE2CuYP3aa	if she only likes guys for their looks than she is REALLY shallow trust me i would no.U can't get any relationships with them|`|xR0AIC1Daa	just do it|`|g3otccOLaa	Well then she`s simply not the girl for a guy.  If she only looks at guys for what they look like & can`t go deeper than that, then I can tell you right now, that you can do better, hunny.(:  |`|8dbfb63772d364bd83640bbe06e40607aa	omg  this is scary. my best friend and i have been friends since kindgergarden. he asked me out in a story. he wrote a story about me-and now its going to get published. do it in a similar way--if you like music-sing to her. well does she know that you like her? and if she doesnt, tell her first in the way you feel most comfortable. dont slam things at her like my friend did. thats the only worst thing to happenn|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	follow these steps and you should be fine    Step 1. get your hand and put them on your balls and grab them to make sure you have some  Step 2. walk up to her  Step 3. Say hi i have liked you sience kindergarden i would really like to know if you would like to go out some time and hangout?  Step 4. after a few dates or hangouts ask her out.    easy as that|`|bk4yLOjQaa	Get your hair done. Ha-ha. Um, you should just ask her out. It's quite simple, really.|`|xJ1TW5Gpaa	not if your hair is short and you're ugly...    lol    just kiddin...      Go for it...if she doesn't like you, keep it movin...|`|3KrQcA5maa	Ask her to hang out, then when someone asks refer to her as "my woman" and things will just go together from there.|`|WDfok8Bnaa	will im fat and im going with this girl that is one of the popular people .then tell her that you have feeling and just be youself because lots of girls like it when people just be their self then u just get this hot girl|`|M9YcTtZPaa	Try to get her alone... and by alone pulling her aside and going to a place not as populated will do. Look into her eyes, and Don't tell her how long you've liked her, but that you've liked her for a while. From that kinda see what her reaction is, and ask her if she'd like to go out with you. You can even invite her to like the movies and do this. Just do it man.
hnXTR8Wwaa	Give her a nickname:)  Compliment her but don't put to much feeling into it  Poke her but not annoyingly  Come up behind her and put your arms around her  Play the staring game with her (catch her eye alot or look at her while she's looking at you and make cute faces)  Have alot of insiders with her  IM/write her notes/e-mail/text her little notes with cute smiley faces  listen to her while she's talking to you  understand her like no one else does;]    I hope this helps, but she may like to flirt defferently|`|W76Lzh3caa	Every girl is different!!|`|3jMsJXjGaa	whenever a guy flirts with me i like him to touch me(JUST HUGS)  and argue with me in a cute way  and smile a lot|`|2nqmoerIaa	be innocent and mushy Dom K|`|zQbvVtgsaa	don't be shy, girls want to know when you're into them! tell them their shirt is cute, give them sexy side-glances, talk to them openly and friendly, keep up with their walk in the halls or wherever, etc..act smooth..just not perverted or disrespectful of women.|`|ANjVmpiXaa	i like it when they are playful and tease me. :)|`|lxSRIFK2aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1778747 6dzz5z5...|`|EdCapqHtaa	Just innocent touching that doesnt seem deliberate|`|m3QhZcCHaa	play with her fingers and stare into her eyes|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	You can comment on their clothes or maybe the perfume they are wearing or even her hair. But don't be lewd. Make nice clean comments.|`|osoTq2dcaa	smile alot and laugh when she says something cute .. and tell her shes cute when she says something silly|`|K0jBt9umaa	its so different with every girl. flirting is supposed to come more naturally though than you planning it. but just smile give her hugs and joke around playfully and tickle her and stuff.|`|OwLckUE5aa	be playfully funny. like, one guy who was flirting with me would mess with my ponytail. and then hed mess with my stuff, and make stupid remarks, like calling me a grandma because i carry tissues in my backpack. then he was like, no, im kidding i think its cute.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	Personally, I think I lean to more of the tease. If a guy is outright mushy its just not attractive, its not like were dating or anything. Play with my mind a little, make me remember stupid things you said to me.|`|d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	I like to joke around with and tease a girl.  I make fun of her but in a playful way.|`|mMcrqP6caa	every girl is different so it wouldn't matter what my answer was because another girl may not want the same thing.  Just be yourself!|`|iJOKKfdIaa	call her beautiful and crap like that mushy stuff|`|losGznxMaa	pick out quotes, songs, and bible verses for me. SMile alot... hugs...  write me messages or just talk to me. have inside jokes...|`|cAPf4kdIaa	i like it when my bf flirts with me. but he does not do anything like laugh at my not funny jokes he complements me like if i ask him what he wants to talk about he will say what ever makes me happy or that his day is better because he got to talk to me things like that he will usually do one a day and on a good day 2 he is shy so that is why he does not do it more|`|Ro4BVoBjaa	I don't like when a guy is too forward, like, going overboard with compliments right off the bat (or saying things like "damn, you're fine" yuck) because it seems like he's just trying to get in my pants. Be sincere. A nice compliment here and there is good. I like when guys try to be my friend first, but lean in a little and are a bit nicer then 'friend' just so I know they are flirting.|`|NwIjasICaa	just out of the blue start playing w/ her hair :)  or wen ur standing nxt 2 her and another girl, whle shes not looking @ u, feel her hair (but not like, stalkerish) and feel the other girls hair, and b like "ur hair is softer" then smile and walk away :)  girls like hair touches  atleast i do :)|`|KhvXdMpNaa	make us laugh  smile at us  ask us to go places with you  hug goodbye  say i was thinking about you earlier casually  say you look pretty      but dont hold the door open for me all the time, it bothers me  i am capable of opening my own door|`|ZyBLhQntaa	I love it when a guy makes me laugh! Or just says hey in the hall. Just something cute!|`|Ln3udE3Zaa	Don't laugh at stupid jokes cause that always pisses me off and I know when I'm making a stupid joke. Smile a lot and compliment her.    Don't call her hot or sexy, call her beautiful or cute. Tell her she looks nice.    Gushy stuff, we love that. :)|`|7zMMXmfWaa	i just like when guys have a sense of humor and poke fun at me.|`|TR91FM5Faa	Make sure she has an idea your interested. girls love  hugs! It shows the guy is confident with himself but dont go and hug every girl just the one you like. Hope this helps|`|9GKN6qPbaa	Well depends...Do they like you back?  if they do, they want you to keep talking to them  Ask for hugs...anything!  But if they don't, then i'm sorry i don't know..|`|IGr9NMhTaa	We really like compliments. I know it sounds shallow, be we like to feel appreciated. Some good pointers for any flirting with any girl is to make sure that you make eye contact. not like you are going to stare her down (creepy) but let her know you pay attention when she's talking. "accidentally" touch her on the hand. And smile. Girls like it when you smile around them. It's the small things that matter most.|`|AUargJTaaa	For me, I like guys to smile at me sweetly and mirror my body language (this comes naturally if you have good chemistry). Also, he must laugh at my jokes, otherwise I won't feel a connection. Making compliments about my clothing and stuff is OK...I wouldn't mind him saying he likes my earrings or something b/c that's more believable.     It's cute when guys contribute to what you say. I hate it when I say something, and this guy just looks me down and says, "yeah" with this smug, gangster look on his face. Big turn off...    OH, and I agree with everyone else. It's cool when a guy says something stupid/random/funny b/c it will leave an impression in my brain. That way, later on during the day, when I think about the guy, I will have a smile on my face.
x4KPgL7saa	Well talk to her ... she seems like she might be depressed ... you know like trying to avoid contact with anyone ... you need to know if she has a problem or something ... talk to her and see if there's something going on with her ...     Hope this was helpful!  Have a nice day.  Good luck (:
9en6c7cRaa	The guy wants to be with you, really he does, but you see, long distance relationships are so difficult. He decided it best to stick with girl he lives close to, but really inside he wants to be with you. He wants you to know that, which is why he sends you those. Tell him again, "If you don't want to date me, don't lead me on." He'll stop, and it will hurt, but you'll move on. If that isn't the approach you want, then I suggest you go and see him. ^_^ Remember, tomorrow is a possibility, not a guarantee, so live life to the fullest.|`|Q4xbYf0Daa	because he likes u|`|028xaZCeaa	i freakin hate that guy!!!! he did the same thing to me!!!!!|`|8d74IGuTaa	i get the feeling he a player... dont open up to much to him.|`|OK3WueETaa	huh|`|jTtNE6dmaa	What's going on is he has a girlfriend who is not all that to him, so he keeps you strung along for kicks and giggles when he is bored or things are not going well with the steady girlfriend.    It's called being a bench warmer.  I'd ditch him until he's ready to put you in the game full time.|`|yXZkYl5saa	Personally, though you probably don't want to hear this but you need to, i think this guy is a player. Yeah, it probably feels nice when he compliments you and does all those cute smiley face crap but he probably is just talking to you when he's lonely or just wants someone. When it's a convenience. The fact that he told you about other girls isn't a good sign. He probably just likes flirting with you, tell him about other guys and see how he reacts.|`|grjyPVyEaa	i think thats its not completly him... you shuldnt of said stop doing that, but instead "why are u flirting with me when u have a girl friend, i mean i like u but umn ur sorta off limits unless ur single... r u" but seriously u dont have to get ova him!!!! win him back... it takes flirting, and playn hard to get... do u know if him n his gf are still dating?????|`|cZf25om5aa	he is just using you as a back up. he had obviously had that girl when you to started talking, and when he told you, he knew you would be mad, so gave you your space, and once it had been a while he was just trying to spice it up again. i think you should just forgot about him and move on with you life, hes not worth it if he is gonna keep using you like that.|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	you are probably better then the other girl he is seeing|`|DiSOdCFXaa	he could be playing it hard to get|`|fyyzKKqpaa	well maybe he's just a player.  but same kinda thing happened with this guy and he told me that he "had a girl who he liked and they hung out a lot" but he told me after that that girl was actually me so yeah we're going out now. lol.|`|zur8kdD2aa	well how far is he from you? I can see his point if you guys can't stay in touch so often.|`|PTXzRjtkaa	he is a player that has no respect for eathier one of you|`|uR8LM6iKaa	god what a player|`|fyyfPEemaa	he sort of wants you but because you live so far away, he doesn't really want that because he knows he won't be able to handle it. or something. you know? so just keep your head up. its better to look  for someone else that lives near you. And even if you really like him, your not in love with him , so run while your still able to. TruST ME. I mean he obviously likes the girl and they might break up. and talk to you again, but it'll probably happen A G A i N . and you'll end up posting the same question. s0 just turn away and find someone else.|`|yzNJ3cc1aa	honestly i don't think you should get involved with him  i tried a long distance relationship once and it ended horribly and i was hurt deeply  it's not worth the time  there's plenty of other guys around, just look :]|`|NEEVRp16aa	Sounds to me like he still wants to play around.  I wouldn't put much time into a relationship until he is ready to do the same.  Make sure you are the only one he is dating.....I am picky that way. LOL!!|`|cYioBe3Kaa	he may actually like you, but he cant accept that a relationship is not possible from that distance. so he's doing the cowardly thing and leading you on. come on hun, you know this won't work unless one of you moves. cut off all contacts with him and forget about him. when you find someone nearby and you will, i guarantee it. also, this may be a good point: he has a girlfriend supposedly yet he is still flirting with you. sound like a good thing? no.|`|MYbRICxqaa	This guy sound crazy to me and he seems that whatever he is saying to you is a lie. This just my opinion, but stay away.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	He likes you.  But he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  It should have been a tipoff that he had a GF because he wouldn't  talk to you on Fridays.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Just delete & block this guy from your MSN.    One thing you'll learn is that many, many people have a different persona online then they do in person. His gf probably doesn't even know that he's IM'ing you. If she did ever ask, he'd blow it off as "Oh just a friend/cousin".     For him, being online means that he can do almost whatever he wants and technically its not cheating in his opinion (not IMO either, but some people do consider that cheating).|`|5dbb8c8bdb7702d4571a984ab730b46baa	come on sweetie you hear what you are saying he told you he has a woman you live to far. see guys know what to do he's playing with your emotions sweetie you don't settle for that you want a man to cherish and appreciate you. he is playing games. you are the prize you never settle for nothing but the best.  if he is meant for you god would reveal it to you good luck sweetie|`|gv5DsZRZaa	he dont even sound like he knows what he wants here.   hes probly keepin u hangin on cuz he dont know what to do over the whole distance thing..     he could also be playin with u.   cuz, guys do that a lot actually.   i learned that the hard way.     only thing i usually do is play back, or ignore em.     anyways,     ur gonna wanna let him know that as long as shes there, u dont want anything beyond "hey whats up"   cuz anything else is like.... cyberdating, right?     eventually hes just gonna ignore u tho if u dont actually see him sometime. or make it LIKE ur gonna do that. like by saying that hes able to see u in like a few months on ur next vacation or whatever else u can think of. something like that. but dont like.. let him play with u.       geez   guys play with girls like cats play with fcking bugs, man.     seriously.     i was totally being messed with not long ago too and now i aint up for it anymore, im done.     :/     but still.|`|wYWUHePjaa	He may just be toying with you.  I had something like this happen to me when my gf moved out of state and we, meaning she, decided we should see other people.  At the same time she wanted to drag me along, just in case.  Mostly from kicks but I didn't no any better because she was like 8 years older then me and I was into her.  Don't play his game and stop responding to him if he tries to talk to you.  Good Luck.|`|pcIkr0mqaa	He sounds like a big problem.  You need to give up on him.  He is playing with your emotions and that is never okay.  Find someone who appreciates that they have you and doesnt just talk to you when they're on the rebound|`|njSyZh0Aaa	if you are like in junior high or like a freshamn or sophomre in high school then hunny your too young for computer relationships sorry|`|2c88J3M7aa	He probably just doesn't want to lose you, and maybe this guy is just a flirt |`|vWlJ9qLOaa	he doesn't know what he wants|`|rrQegyaSaa	Well, in my own opinion, I think he wants you both. He loves the personality or characteristics that you possess but he also loves the physical closeness of the other girl. I think that you are stuck in a lose lose situation unless the physical distance between you two is shortened.|`|17a6583edef64881cc7d4f050e0239d8aa	You need to set the story straight with him.  Tell him that you don't like these games he's playing because he keeps going back and forth between you and this girl.  Tell him you don't want anything with him because of this.  Keep talking to him every once in a while PURELY as friends, if he keeps persisting for a long time, then maybe he's done with the games and he really wants you.  At the same time, I recommend talking to other men and trying to stay in touch, go out.  Best of luck with everything.  I know it must be tough, but you'll pull through.|`|sr9QrrrRaa	plain and simple. he enjoys playing with you. he likes knowing that there is a girl out there that will like him when his girlfriend dumps him, because she will. hes insecure and wants all the attention he can get. he doesnt like you. dont settle for stupidity.|`|sAAm20XBaa	the guy is prob guy some player that wants as many girls as he can get....block his screen name, and ignorehis texts and phone calls and you should be just fine.........hes not even worth it hun, he lives far away from you & if its over 30 min. and your not seeing eachother 2 or 3 times a week in personit aint worth it because you dont know what hes doing in NY with other girls that you dont know.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	he a player!|`|ftvPJfEXaa	.|`|LNZwgexwaa	Long distance is never a good way to begin a relationship.  Also, he is playing with your emotions.  I've had plenty of experience with guys like this and I would say - stop talking with him altogether before you become too attached.    You know the saying, "There are plenty of fish in the sea!"  You should be treated with kindness, etc.  Good luck!|`|AA11732882	i think you shouldn't be friends with him and obviously he likes you.|`|CSryVJFdaa	He is confused and indecisive. He probably likes you but have some kind of commitment with the other girl. He probably don't like other girl but is confused and likes you instead but cant say it cuz he may have something going on with the other girl. You only see one side of story, why dont you guys talk it out amongs each other and clear the air between 2 of you. Explain to him how you feel. Remember communication is the most important part in a relationship. Good luck :)|`|AkTw3RQuaa	He is playing you like violin  The Games people play  He is a player in the making  He is a liar, conniving,petty, 2 timing, slick,selfish looser  Drop that zero,, and get you a hero  You sound young..why you so desperate? You will meet your Prince soon  Is he worth all this DRAMA ?  He got a job, skill, education, $ ?  If the answer is NO  Be gone...long gone  This dude is a  player
c4FP3bGvaa	not at allllll, guys would be relieved if girls did it for once instead of guys takin all the pressure. we would feel how girls would feel flattered and thoughtful for the asker :D.
kPazsMkoaa	Go up to him and apologize. Tell him that you feel really bad, and that you regret it. If he really liked you for you, he would accept your apology.  Then if he accepts your apology, ask him to the dance, in order to make it up to him. I hope it works!|`|YZzT5rFraa	Tell him you had to tell her shes you're best friend, you were so excited you couldn't contain yourself then say sorry.|`|onXmufvWaa	if he has confided in u a lot recently then he's gonna feel betrayed and its gonna take a lot to get his trust back again - meet him somewhere where he feels comfortable and explain why u told yer mate about him splitting up wiv his girlf - just be honest and he'll more than likely realise that u weren't intentionally breaking his confidence

CSryVJFdaa	Talk to him face to face. May be there's something going on with him. Don't analyze talk to him.
7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	You can "trojan horse" your way into getting her number, by having some ostensibly desirable activity that you might need it for (such as working on a group project for school together).    But as a practical matter?  Not really.  Once you ask for her digits, if she has any experience with boys at all, she knows what the deal is.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Say you want to study together and you'll call her to arrange it. Or you could just ask her. It's not a bad thing if she knows you like her.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	Get to know her. Get her msn and stuff off a friend that has hers.|`|AUargJTaaa	Make a study group with a couple of your/her friends, then you can all exchange numbers. That way, it will seem more of a business affair.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Well then, put on a dance and ask her to it. Could be a dance of only 10 people.|`|uReFjOONaa	ask some of her class mates to get her number for you|`|2vazHHXeaa	Ask for multiple people's numbers while you're around her.  Make it seem like you just want everybody's number.|`|SF6lYLImaa	If you want her number, why would you not want her to know you like her?  Isn't that kind of the point of asking for a girl's number?|`|f8bd5677bcf38585dd6016bf3f2c4687aa	Say that  you guys need to hang or chill more (use low-key words), ask if she has a cell, then say "Cool what's the number?"|`|kWBXSjHXaa	I just ask them straight up hey you have a phone ? girl:ya . me: ok whats your numer. girl:number. me:thanks hun. well thats just me i dont get embarassed lol|`|WuyElWYHaa	Find something that interests her like something  that she enjoys alot and talk about it with her when the conversation gets really good suddenly u remember something important and gotta go but ask for her number so u can finish the conversation.|`|oMXlbWu9aa	By asking for her phone number she prolly can tell that you like her.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	thats kinda hard to do especially if shes a grade under you (unless you guys have some classes together? maybe? doubt it?) i would just start out with a convo and ask it subtly. if u guys have classes together just say "hey i need some help with "w/e" and i was wondering if u could help me? and then go from there.|`|eaXCrRnxaa	I guess you come up with a mutual interest and ask for her number telling her: "next time I go do "such and such" Ill call you so you can come".  (An example would be: eating something you both like, going to see a particular type of movie, playing some sport/game you know she likes)|`|9NmltZy8aa	you shhold be all hey can i have your number then say we can prank call somepeople make it fun to distract from the romanticness and get a laugh out of her

QSodlfMraa	yeah my bf use to do that all the time when we just started dating. he would be like just saying hi or i love you cute.|`|2nMkDyDqaa	maybe to just talk
6196ajxJaa	theres nothing you can do.. except packing up your feeling and move on.. dun expect anything if you wanan remain as friend to her.. treat her the way she always like it and not expecting anything special. then maybe one day she will rediscovered that lost feeling.. gd luck|`|t0uIgY08aa	Its really really hard, and completely sucks. But the best thing to do is keep yourself busy, don't think about it, and move on. It'll hurt for 2 maybe 3 weeks but it gets easier after that. Try and go out with friends and just have fun.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	i think you should move on|`|QfvHoPFMaa	move on!|`|0MJGXOD2aa	i no how u feel, the same thing happened 2 me . it wont hurt unless u make it hurt, u starting loving some1, but u can also stop. try doin a sport and hanging out with friends alot 2 get ur mind off it. ignor all calls, and juss move on =) p.s. dont let ppl get 2 u and listen 2 ur heart not others 
PiygwqNhaa	yeah! but theres somethings you can keep to yourself.. sometimes|`|3HQPgGOGaa	Yes!~|`|AA11425983	Heck yeah =)|`|xdnGjioUaa	yessssssss
ff1dd8e9919a92f32e14002ac61080dfaa	Just brush it off. He's probably confused simply because you never smiled to him in the hall before. Or, ever. Why the hell would anyone be disgusted by a simple smile? C'mon! :P    And, avoiding eye contact would just make it worse... he'd be torn by the question of why you smiled so brightly at him one time, and be so utterly cold the rest of the time.    Next time, when you see him, you should wave and say hi to him! :D If he blatantly ignores you when you do that... then forget him.|`|AA10614910	wow, he actually made a face? that's messed up :(  he was probably like "wtf do i know you"  sounds like you gave a "flirty grin" instead of a friendly one
f5aa73943f8ed364c73587e542d735d9aa	Yes, she will think you like her, but that's not weird. You should like girls at your age. Most guys at your age are too afraid of asking girls out because they do not want to get rejected. My guess is that some girls like you too, but you'll never know unless you may the first move. Choose your destiny...you know?     Good luck!|`|t0uIgY08aa	awe no way that's the icing on the cake. Really. I hate it when guys are like your hot, sexy... The ones that catch my attention are the ones that say Your Beautiful. Makes me weak haha|`|1XcTZRemaa	It might be a little weird. Even though it might be sweet, I'm not sure how I would react if a guy told me that.     Instead, you could try just complimenting girls. For instance, "You look very nice today." or "You have such pretty eyes." Kind of romantic things like that, but still in a high school setting. :]     Good luck on finding that perfect girl!|`|R2BBjtaraa	go ahead she'll probably think you like her or simply think its a nice compliment. go for it|`|HypqcnJaaa	No? You can flirt with anyone you like. She would think you liked her if you only did it to her. If you flirt with everyone it's fine.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	I doubt there's a girl on this planet thst wouldn't appreciate a guy telling her he thinks she's beautiful.|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	yes that would make her think that you like her  no it wouldnt be weird it would be sweet|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	It would make me feel like they like me, but thats just me.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	No that's not weird!  It's really sweet!  Girls LOVE getting compliments  :)|`|SzDfQjvIaa	kinda it depends how you pharse it,    insted of "hey beautiful."    say " hey cutie." or "your kinda cute."    hope i helped|`|dOkw3xhcaa	Thatt would be so sweet! Do it!|`|60NJNjEpaa	she would fall for you instantly.  you better watch it romeo! haha good luck!|`|XQbEyVJ1aa	Do it, if it's not in a creepy way, in the right context, with a girl you know, etc, then even if she thinks you like her it's not that bad. and all girls like to hear that.|`|IQfaj1BGaa	awwww thats sweet  you should call the girl that you like 'beautiful'|`|f0c95deaaf11cb4f884379031898dea3aa	No way is that weird.    If your subtly flirting and say she's beautiful in a non-player way then I bet she would love it.    I know when someone randomly tells me I'm beautiful I blush and it makes me smile and feel good.|`|4AAVCLybaa	i think that'd be sweet. (:|`|xdnGjioUaa	its not weird... but she would prb think you had some feelings for her|`|0MJGXOD2aa	no, if u do lyke her, it will be more of a hint, but just try and say it in a funny, clever way =) good lucl |`|pC1H7kO4aa	I'm pretty sure that's a dead give-away, whether you actually like her or not!|`|ggO7AIqvaa	yes it would lead her on...and it is a sweet thing even if she wasnt ur gf.  it is a compliment and you will make her day!  totally not weird!|`|iWg7Z1mDaa	duh lol.  if u like her call her beautiful =]  girls love that way more than hot.  she will fall for u like that =]]|`|aQ8EK9hraa	id say use the word beautiful and gorgeous as apposed to hot and those kind of words. it could give her a hint you like her or she'll think your just being a sweet guy :D|`|Ic6YekeWaa	girls love compliments...  it can make the sun come out on a rainy day    girls are just hopeless romantics =D|`|Biq3cD2Laa	well im a girl n i would b flattered if a guy told me im beutiful n yes i would think he likes me|`|z5StcT1haa	personaly teen girls these days hardley EVER get called the dusty word "beautiful" if i were ever called beautiful instead of the cliche "sexy" ,"hot" or "cute" i would never forget who told me. :)  id be thinkin about that guy for 3 days weather i liked him or not.|`|gew4KVFfaa	nah. its not weird. its sweet=)    |`|XU6SxUbDaa	no but i think she might ask you out later on|`|34Adt0m7aa	duh. most girls would prefer beautiful than hot.|`|spq89t0Aaa	well if shes all dressed up or somthing, be like 'you look beautiful./ u are beautiful'  but  if out of the blue, u say ''YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL''  it may be a   shocker, and she , depending on how much she likes you, could either be super excited x10 , or get a restraining order      id say, tho, pick1 girl u like|`|LABJI7dfaa	yes it would be|`|ayjOCBbZaa	duh|`|AA11925830	No, you call her beautiful and she's all yours, trust me. hehe|`|5645dba22694c074372485a07da51203aa	no it's not weird|`|WGebRhqyaa	that would be awesome to say to a girl & she'll probably get the hint that you like her.|`|gn5fqD6xaa	It would not be weird and yes, it would make a girl think you like her. :) Take it from a girl.|`|5tYGBJIsaa	no. maybe not. she could develop a like for you from then on though.... idk though... i'm not her lol.|`|3QG6WLXXaa	tell her|`|pqlhPnexaa	It all depends on the way you say it. If you're kinda flirting, and you slide in something about how "a gorgeous girl like you could totally get away with that," or something, then it'll get across the point that you like her and find her attractive without seeming weird.    Just don't randomly go up to her and say "oh you're so beautiful..." and just kind of look at her... speaking as a girl, that'd be way creepy.    But if you can do it right, a compliment like that would definitely be something that would make her think you like her!    Good luck and have fun!|`|GmRMniJSaa	It wouldn't be all that weird. It'd make you look like a nice guy, and if it was me, I don't know if I'd think you'd like me, but I would definitely think you were a real gentleman.|`|pYuta7Nlaa	thats creepy|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Na dude all the guys I hang with call me that.... Its good to know my friends think highly of me... and if they wanted to show more feeling they would be saying like you are really beautiful.. or your the most beautiful girl.... But if you say Hey whats up beautiful or there is our beautiful girl then thats different|`|u5yCeyYSaa	it all depends what the situation what is she like bla bla bla............. if she is your friend and you know her call her that or hot or something but if its just some random girl she will think you are a creeper|`|wK9LeXS7aa	If you say she is beautiful she will either think that you are creepy or you like her. Wait for the right time. You know, in the right sentence and conversation.|`|KPKv5hwqaa	Yes she would think you like her because normal people don't just complement girls like that unless they like them. But if you like her call her beautiful. Luck!|`|ATxbz7IXaa	If you really like her and call her that, that will be so sweet.|`|b8JPPhE0aa	Um yes and no.    I have guy friends who say "hey u look beautiful/pretty today" Or  "your dressed nice today". It depends on how close you are to   that person. If you barely know her and you say that she'll be like  "um okay, thanks?" and she'll kind of be flattered at the same time.    But if your looking for a girlfriend don't just say it straight out to   that girl. Get to know her first. Good luck, hope I helped :)|`|ZDwZqv9saa	no many boys have called me pretty and so on they have even called me hot but they don't like me and if they do i don't care but you got to be careful if they are shy you got to be careful shy girls think about everything to hard and talkive girls just listen then forget hoped i helped|`|xlbMRcesaa	I think it'd be sweet, but I'd either think he's gay or he likes me. If you say it in a friendly or sarcastic way, then yea it's super cute :)|`|3F8PgjIlaa	It wouldn't be weird at all   Depends on who you say it to  Don't say it to someone who'll slap you hahahaha.|`|lVe280fFaa	No, definitly not. Girls do not like to be told that they are not pretty or that there is someone hotter than they are. Trust me. If you tell a girlfriend of yours that she's not pretty, she will most definitly get upset. No offense girls, please don't call me sexist. I just have noticed that from expierience dating. I will not say anymore.|`|ixvzhoGUaa	It's perfectly okay to be 15 and never had a girlfriend before !!  you have more time to find yourself and have fun being single !  i'm 15 and a sophomore, and i've never had a boyfriend either.   don't rush or force yourself into finding someone, take your time.  these things happen naturally when the time is right,  but if you really do want a girlfriend right now, just try to become friends with a couple of girls, and get to know them.  and yes, it would be great if you told a girl she was beautiful,  but if you're going to do that make sure you like her, don't tell her that without there being a reason because she could get hurt thinking that you like her, so be careful ! take care and good luck =)|`|f2XdVMD1aa	You call girls beautiful all the time on Y! answers. You can definitely call a girl you like beautiful. its really sweet.
fV9SawuPaa	Well you make a lot of physical contact and flirtatious gestures at these guys. If you did it to one guy, like your best guy friend, it wouldn't be a big deal. The fact you do it with ALL your guy friends makes you seem extremely flirty. Remember, guys pick up on that kind of stuff as your flirting with them. Although YOU may think it's harmless, some of your "guy friends" may think otherwise. I'd be careful if I were you. Hugging them when you greet and leave is one thing, constantly touching and "messing around" with them could make you look bad.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Yea but girls can be very catty and judgmental.  They might not know you or just feel jealous that you can be so open with guys and not be scared or shy.  Although, hugging on guys like that isn't exactly cute either.  They should mind their own business but it would be a good characteristic to tone down a little on your part as well.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	my best friend is like you, and your not a slut, it's just in your nature. To you it may not seem like your flirting, but to other people, you are. Sometimes people flirt without knowing they flirt, so way don't you talk to the guy you do like and go out with him so people can stop talking about you?|`|otnJOmwSaa	................................... you're in a bit of trouble... i know a girl like that in my school... everyone thinks shes a slut.... :S|`|dd07d44218c6f0cb9b4e55aae3015401aa	your not a whore, you sound like a perfectly normal person. you don't even sound like your being promiscuous to me, just tell your girl friends to grow up because your not flirting with anyone. if they continue then they're not your real friends anyway, stick with the people who have stuck by your side since kindergarten through thick and thin.    hope everything works out :-) xox|`|aheO01Fgaa	Don't worry! I have many guy friends but your case is ridicules! Girls are SO catty and annoying! Don't listen to them...they are stupid! Just stick with the guys...they are your true friends! Good luck and stick to your school work and try to get better grades...that is what really matters in life!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Just be yourself if the girls can't handle it. Tough!! Make new friends.|`|6m2C1HuIaa	im really buddy buddy with guys and i get called stuff but i tell em to suck it and i keep on keepin on|`|h8497njCaa	uhhhhhh.....i do not wanna b ur frnd...no offence|`|OCdJ38EQaa	do NOT change for those jealous *** bitches. seriously, they are just jealous of you. so, keep doing what you are doing. there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with having fun and hanging out with your best guy friends. :)|`|dFQ5Xbj2aa	who cares what they say? as long as your friends are still your friends then its all good. just ignore them and they probably would get over it eventually|`|yzNJ3cc1aa	yeah i have guy friends that i've known for awhile the most i will do is hug them in public but i tell them i love them (as friends) on the phone i'm not like all over them.... you sound super skanky and i'm guessing you're fat too. i don't think it's proper to be all over a ton of guys even if you are close to them.|`|MYbRICxqaa	I couldn't finish reading your post because it was getting on my nerves. You can not change who you are so, why do what others want you to do? If you enjoy flirting then continue to do so. Your friends need to step up there game to reach your level. What else are you doing to make the boys crazy? Also, stop telling these boys you love them. You just can not tell someone you love them that makes you a hypocrite.|`|Ku2AIH3Qaa	omg i am so the same way i have a lot of guy friends, and i love hanging out with them and of course i give them hugs... you should tell the girls to get the **** over it and move on dont change who you are... i only have one really good friend thats a girl and thats cause we are pretty much the same... dont worry bout what the girls think as long as the guys dont care... you shouldnt either|`|RCaQaaTyaa	tell your friends your not changing for them. stay the way you are.|`|zc82Q0KRaa	OMG Quit being a slut!|`|EhHfq3i0aa	uh... try to like embarass him... he won't like you and probably stop flirting with you. or you should go up to him and tell him the truth that you don't like him... iv'e had the same problem with a girl... it works but it might break there heart...|`|2c88J3M7aa	Omgsh, thats what girls in my school do  You should stop hugging them and stuff - like be friends with them but don't touch them. And maybe do one of your friends a favour and hook them up or something =)|`|tegyqU6Raa	well just try a little every day to praise your friend that likes the guy. while the guy is there. try to focus on her not him.|`|o1irBbeNaa	dont even worry about it, im the same way i flirt with everyone i dont mean anything by it its just how i am. dont worry about haters, they come and go and theyre wasting theyre time by worrying what your doing, tell them to get a freaking life.|`|11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	Ahh, I had that situation! My guy friends got jealous when I went to hang out with other guys I had recently met, and a lot of girls called me a flirt and said a lot of bad stuff about me. People like us, sometimes we just don't NOTICE. I know that seems hard to believe for other people, but it's just in our nature to "flirt" I guess. Tell your friends FIRMLY that you do NOT like your guy-friends, you're just really good friends. Your friends are just jealous because they like them and wish that your guy friends would pay more attention to them. I don't know how to solve that, but in the meantime, try to cut back on some of the more flirtatious things you're doing. It does seem like you're giving your guy friends a little too much attention to make it seem like you're "just friends" from another person's perspective.|`|4M2QTN8faa	tell them to SHUT THE F*CK UP!!!!!!!!!!   tell them to mind their own buisness and to go get a life and stay out of yours and that they are jelous of you|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Actually, I liked a girl that was like you. I dont know how to explain it. It hurt me a ton when she goofed with other guys and then those guys wpould come up to me and say,"man, i just want to f $@ her!'' Then i would get really pissed. So to fix it i just stopped talking to her. I cant tell you what to do but i know how i felt and the problems it caused me because not only did it hurt me, my freinds didnt like her because of how she acted. But i understand too well what your talking about.|`|QuFuDApWaa	dude i know what you mean. believe me i have the same problem. and i HATE IT. im just friendly and everyone is like oh you  like them! oh you're flirting. iim like OMFG I AM NOT! it drives me nuts. i've found in easier to be nice to the guys and act like that but stay away from psychical things, touching, ruffling hair. i still hug them, and bother them when they dont give me a hug. and your not a slut. dont worrie about it. just considerate on acting with them like you do  with your girl friends.   good luck i know how it goes [im currently going thru the same thing]  peace babe|`|4ZoMzfSPaa	your true friends should believe you or their not your real friends.  if you know those guys since kindergarten then still hang out with them and tell the ppl that "it's no big deal we're just friends" and if a rumor starts and says you guys are dating make it stop! Just go around and be like "how many times do i have to tell you were not dating!"|`|yScqJTZ4aa	you should never change for anybody   if they don't like you then oh well|`|9Vffg27Haa	tell them to shut up and if they don't slap them or something and maybe they will get the idea, i have a lot of guy friends to but i like someone else and all my friends know that. but if ur best bud don't believe u that u don't like the guy she likes she is not a true friend, just keep on hangin with ur guy buds as usual and don't listen to any one else.|`|yGWQuL81aa	Pick the better friend.|`|tSYB11xdaa	Ok, the girls are just jealous don't get get to upset about it . I would reccomend that you just stay the way you are. Who needs people around you that just put you down and say mean things that hurt you. I think that your guy friends are more important then those girls that are mean to you. Just stay the way you are because it sounds like you have some really good guy friends. It shouldn't matter if your BFF's are girls or guys. hope I was helpful|`|YcfO8Mqeaa	omg ur totally not a slut  i'm like that and all the little brats say im a slut. im not. idc wat they say, just be friends with whoever u want to. if they say ne thing bout u liking them say "yea i'll do em' all, then go 4 ur bf" haha mabye u shouldn't say that|`|rtcubrgtaa	okay first off, take a deep breath. if your friend hates you for "flirting with other guys" then that isnt a real friend because usually every girl flirts. Its a girl thing. I tell my guys as friends that i love them and usually people dont care. Sometimes ill have people come up to me and say "oh you and so and so should go out!" jus because we would say i love you to eachother (as friends). If that happens jus say nahh im good. Maybe you should go out! and just keep on telling them your "plans" of hooking them up so yu can annoy them and give them that sign to shut the **** up. If someone asks you if you like somebody just say something like "oh yeahhhhhh" but in a joking/sarcastic way. Or maybe you should think about going out with some of these guys that you "flirt" with. If you date a lot of guys then its better so you get more experience. If somebody calls you a whore after this just say "at least i get guys". Theres nothing wrong with flirting with guys. Usually people tell me that i flirt with guys alot too, but most of the time im just talking to them like how i would talk to them as my friends and people automaticaly think im flirting. Its stupid right? your guna just have to get over the fact that people just get jealous of your flirting skills. You should be proud that you flirt with a lot of guys. If yur friends keep getting mad at you, just ignore them and they'll realize that they are getting mad at you for dumb reasons and they will hopefully apologize.|`|ed6637c128675855c4f6dd3ce3f6d584aa	Honey, There are a lot of people that have a lack of people skills and are jealous of people that do. If you have good friends that you love, no matter what sex or race, never let anyone make you feel guilty or ashamed for loving them or caring for them and especially for being happy. Be yourself. And if anyone has a problem with it, then they are not a very good friend themselves.|`|eyur9OXVaa	Only people with one-laned minds would continue to treat you this way. All it is, you are a young open-minded person and enjoy who you are. Being flirtatious is not a bad thing as long as you are not doing it for self-esteem, self- confidence, or to get too much attention. As  far as grades and family, do not let pity things like this affect on your education and relationship. Live your life to the fullest just keep your mind on a positive route, your health, education, family, and future.
rrQegyaSaa	You definitely did not say anything wrong. In my eyes, you said all the right things to her. Although it may not have showed on the outside, on the inside she was smiling ear to ear because she knows that at least one person is looking to grow to love her. If she is recently coming out of a break up or something of that nature, give her time for her wounds to heal. It is only a matter of time before she comes around searching for you. Now she is going to think that you are a gentlemen, who cares deeply for her AND her wishes. That is the most romantic thing a girl can ask for. She will grow on you as well as she on you, right now she is just going through that "I need to be by myself and get my thoughts together" phase. Give her time and yours shall come. =)|`|DsIbGLYUaa	it doesnt matter because she never liked you no means no, sorry but the truth hurts|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Nah man, you got it all wrong, that could be a good thing.  That was really sweet, like art .    "I really like you and will wait until you're ready bcus you're really someone that I've been looking for".     AND IT WAS BAD *** , why?? Because it was confident, persistent .    Confidence is a major turn on for chicks.    You did ok , man if she isnt good enough for you someone def is .     I think it's important that you keep those balls of steel now, but don't act desperate , if you see her again just smile or something and walk on by.    Start talking to other women, get exp, confidence in doing so, and let her see that you are a contender . Start to smell , and look good, and have confidence.|`|AA11146445	First off don't feel like such a clingie idiot for putting yourself out there i mean you told her how you felt and that takes major guts. Although in my opinion you shouldn't have told her that. She stated that she wanted to be "just friends" and by saying something like that it kind of makes a girl feel as if you didn't get the clue. Don't worry though its not the end of the world,just act casual around her and be a "friend" If she is the person you've been waiting for then she'll soon realize how great a guy you are but if she doesnt then thats cool,just means you two weren't compatible|`|jP5caZJiaa	I POOP TOO MUCH  AND THEN I GET TIRED|`|yzNJ3cc1aa	I think she might be making up excuses not to date you (sorry)  is there any reason or   something you might of done to make her not like you?   i don't think you did anything wrong on the phone though.|`|1Lo0wd09aa	i think maybe from past experience shesz jush not ready for a relationship emotionally and maybe she cant be with yu bcuz she doesnt want to hurt yu... buh i think itsz good tht yu told her how yu felt so yur not jush left there wondering wat if  hope tht helped a bit =)|`|UP33GlBwaa	I dont think you look like a clingy idiot, but she is clearly not ready and at least had the honesty to tell you to back off.  She could be having second thoughts.  You might of scared her.  And she had feelings for you and keeping away is her way of dealing with not being with you anymore, because she needs time alone and she knows if she was to just hang out with you as friends that it would be difficult.  So cut her some slack and let her go.  You probably at one time had a good thing going, but something happened to make her think twice.  You need to evaluate what took place and if at all you treated her in a disrespectful way.  You might not think that you did, but you could of done something to turn her away and like I said, scare her.  Actions speak louder than words.  Good luck to you and if you really love her, respect her decision.  Show her that you are a good guy.|`|uvcqPfuNaa	She probably finds it cute that you are that devoted. She now at least thinks you are a great guy and will realize you are truly serious with your intentions. Don't regret what you did but I would suggest also not mentioning it anymore with her unless she brings it up.|`|ymybcLoeaa	aww! i think its cute, but if shes like really over it, she might end up changing her name and moving cuz she thinks your a bit of a pycso...
e1f65fa757e92ddb0730f3fbd8ec9b15aa	Hey, you are obviously in a relationship and you think your partner is straying, or something along those lines? am I right?  Well you can tell if someone is lying when they start to figit when you ask them a question particularly around their mouth or nose area.  Also if the palms of their hands are pointing towards the floor.  They often cant make eye contact or may go red and behave abnormal when the question is asked.  Think about how you would act when you are telling a deep lie and try to spot the signs? Also, if you think your man is cheating on you, dont you think that you should get rid? I have had this happen to me and cheating is the worst in a relationship and it never gets easier with time, but losing them does.|`|c5b7fcfd73d6bead7857f39c2ccf243daa	a guy lies when their lips are movng, sorry (LOL)  you might be able to tell by their actions, their eyes, do they have the guilty look to them?  different ways|`|AA11296254	Their lips are moving.|`|AA11134384	His nose grows|`|a29f92e22ddeb45d7df6d51142e7801caa	I'n a guy,so.If he scratches around his mouth area,if he rubs his hands,if he doesn't make eye contact.If he doesn't say something with a straight face.|`|3169b315466a18413f05a4626ec26cd1aa	Not just guys but this applies to everyone.

Talk to 'em more but don't stalk him.    Good luck :)
jChbnuafaa	she interested all right  not sure if she likes you just yet...    i am in that situation at the moment  im texting this guy and its a long conversation but im not sure i really really like him but im def. interested. i need to get to no him better.    so just keep talking to her and get to no her and hang out with her on the weekends or something|`|Draugm5qaa	i know that often if someone isn't interesting to me,  i will disrequard their texts and give brief answers.    but sometimes when i am bored, i will continue texting.  if i'm interested in someone or want to get to know them better,  i'll talk with them for a long time.    is she texting you, or are you texting her?  if you are the one reaching out,  if you stop would she message you first.    try flirting with her a little and see what the response is,  hope this helped.    best answer ? :)|`|W9pfAhx6aa	yea.|`|xPXNHjyeaa	possibly, yes. specially if you think that you are really bonding and have lots of things talked about thru text.

uhdoYK7Saa	Well,there are pros and cons to both. Are you looking for your boyfriend in a physical manner or emotional? I'm not a virgin, but if that is something that is important to you, that he is a virgin, then of course. But, experience is always nice. Some boys are experience mentally so they know what to do, but the first chunk of time will be a bit akward. if a guy hasnt ever done it, they might fumble around a bit and such. But if a guy is experienced...it will feel amazing.(if you have an emotional attachment as well) so if ur more in for it to feel good, then id say find a guy who's experienced but is someone you care about. But, if you just want it to be a special experience and you really care about the guy, it can be magical that way too. Just dont do it before your're ready.|`|4k5AAm8Daa	i am proudly :D  (im fourteen)     But okay idk when i plan of having sex but if im like 16 to oh say 23 i want him a virgin.    but if im married and older i want him with experince but ust a little not too much... i dont want a guy that has slept with every girl..|`|CF6BiAnDaa	Doesn't matter.|`|FY3z8Dq7aa	well, we expect the guys to be a virgin and loyal but also we want them to be good, i mean realllyyy good and experienced.   so i guess both is fine..    virgin and inexperienced=boring   experienced but not a virgin= now that's pretty hot.|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	i would rather him be a virgin too, because it would be more special between us, plus we would feel more comfortable.  trust me, it happened :] i wouldn't have had sex with him if he wasnt a virgin honestly.|`|AA11649495	the idealistic thing is for both ppl to be virgins, it would be very nice if he was one too because both are sharing an experience with one another that no one else has shared with them. its more special i guess. but it really doesn't matter and it shouldn't matter. i think it mostly depends on the level of maturity, the love, connection and respect. i cant really say i prefer one over the other.|`|IGr9NMhTaa	I would rather we both be virgins.

I've thought of this b4  &I honestly would be fine w/both.virgens dont mind entirely as much as expirienced girls bout sex or how important it is for the sex to always be great.    Usually more concernd how & w/who they'll do it w/(if not eager to just loose it)    I think what would matter is the chemistry shared.. I wouldnt mind having a bf explaining to me and knowin his way, and ofcourse it would be nice having the expirience new to both of us, not just me alone|`|58jwkbbSaa	I would rather my husband be a virgin.|`|hN08l7tLaa	experience. so that both of us wont look stupid. lolx|`|uojIfxaoaa	to me, it doesnt matter. if you like them that much you shouldnt really care.|`|C9z5g6pVaa	heyy  im not a virgin but   if i was lol . i wouldn't really mind   but if the guy does have experience it would make me feel  more confident :)|`|GJFFFlNtaa	i wouldn't want him to have like slept with tons of girls, but i might want him to have a little expierience.|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	when i was one i did want someone who was also one.  and thats what i got.  and now neither of us are one.|`|y3qClcDyaa	experience|`|9nOhhIiCaa	I'd much rather him be a virgin.

UUx74K5Caa	Maybe he just saw your face and recognized you.  You watched one too many Datelines.|`|61ZtWyqKaa	so who does find you on myspace seriouslu either he is a stalker or someone has told him ur details|`|xwG6e7IQaa	It's probably because your black!|`|S01zIagOaa	Yes that seems stalkerish. He's a random guy whom you've never even exchanged a hello with. If he's not socially adjusted enough to introduce himself and have a normal conversation then you certainly shouldn't be engaging him in any way online.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Yes, he obtained your email info...exactly how any stalker does- without your consent. I would ask him how he got it. You have a right to know this!|`|tlUihEOvaa	That is very creepy, I mean how was he able to find you? Did he like type your real name and kept browsing?     I dunno how he found your profile but I just think that is scary. The same thing happened to me with this guy but I declined his invite. But I'm a guy so I'm not afraid of him trying to harass me. >.>     I guess he likes you and wants to add you so he can get to know you? But still if you don't know him why did he add you? I don't think it was a good move for him.    Edit: ok Yeah now I think he just wants to get to know you but through online first. If you ignore it maybe he will realize that his approach isn't working. Honestly I didn't think his move was all too smart but I guess I know some people who relate to his situation. The thing I just think that made it very creepy is how he found you.|`|zdUsKpiHaa	Hmm. I'm sure he doesn't mean to seem so stalkerish. He definitely likes you but he's shy to just go up to you so he's gonna start out by messaging you through myspace. Then it would be easier to say hi at school. Would you feel different if he was cute, does he actually have a stalker-look about him? Who knows, maybe he found your myspace first and thought you were cute. Then he sees you at school and thinks OMG that's her! Slim chance but lol. Oh well it's up to you what you wanna do but I know he likes you but is too shy. But no it's not too wildly stalkerish imo.|`|uTlk2YF6aa	yeah.. hes a stalker.. do u like him?|`|QddOKwnIaa	He probably knows somebody your friends with and saw your page. He just thinks you're cute and interested, don't be so stuck up.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	No, it doesn't seem stalkerish.  I was actually stalked and it's not all cutesy like this.  It sounds like he might have a crush on you.  Having a crush is not stalking.|`|2NGCD7y2aa	How much do you know about stalking? Quiz:  http://stalkingawarenessmonth.org/stalki...  Some kids are computer hackers.  It is common for stalkers to use high-tech equipment these days.  I'm not saying this means this guy is stalking you, but,   You might want to talk to a school counselor about this.    Fact Sheet on Stalking  http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/resear...

1wCito3jaa	They have it atleast 4times a week. It just depends on the sort of person you are. to have a loving relationship you dont always need sex. I hope this helps
R9OeVxeZaa	I am so, so sorry. You can never really be ready or prepared for these sort of things, and there's never really a way to cope. You just have to ride it out, kind of tolerate the pain until it ebbs down gradually. And it does. Nothing will ever take away the memories or the sorrow, but it will become bearable over time.    Earlier this year, I had my first real experience with death. My best, best friend passed away from a two-year old cyst in the brain. She had been sick with various ailments for as long as I'd known her, for as long as she'd been alive even. So it was expected, to an extent, but never really accepted....she was only 18. She went into a sudden coma for a few hours. All her friends and family gathered to see her for one last time, and then she passed peacefully.     The worst part is that we had gone through a very rough patch near the end that we never really got the opportunity to fix. I didn't  see her or talk to her everyday like we used to, so I get to pretend that she's not really gone, but rather just, somewhere else. Somewhere I can't reach her as of yet, but I will, soon, someday.     This is the time when you really need to hold on to the people you love, hold on to the people who know your pain and share it. I don't like crying in front of my grandmother, but I did it anyway. I used to curl up next to her while she watched tv and just cry my eyes out, and she'd be so affectionate. Trust me, the best thing you can have right now is people around you. You need people to keep telling you it's going to be okay, because it's really hard to reassure yourself in times like these. Just cry your eyes out (tears were made for these times), don't be ashamed, spend all the time you want sleeping. Just let your body and mind put themselves through that natural process of catharsis and recovery. Human beings are strong, and you are, too.     And, when you feel ready, fill your time with happy things. Make the effort. If that makes you feel guilty, don't let it. You know your grandfather loved you dearly and he'd want you to be happy and fulfilled again, as soon as possible. Eat your favourite foods, watch funny movies, hang out with friends. Fill every moment of your life with happiness until it takes over, and you don't need to make the effort anymore. Do it in his honour, in his memory. It's the best thing you can do for him now. Just be happy. (The day she died I spent 12 hours on Neopets, like a zombie. I could hear her in my head, cheering for me every time I won something. People who love us want us to be happy).     Death is only temporary separation. It is a tiny little painful prick in the vast span of existence that is eternity. Don't think it's the end. I know that it feels like you won't see him again, and you won't for some time. But nothing in the universe can keep true family and friends apart. That is the omnipotent power in the universe- love. Your grandfather and my friend are both in a happy, wonderful place now, away from illness, and old age, and pain, watching everyone they loves on earth, hoping that they make the best of their time there. Remember that, embrace your life and time and just be happy.     I wish you all the luck and strength and happiness in the world. Please take care.

Death is so complicated!  :(  Well, when my grandmother died, the best thing was I took some small belonging of hers, that I remember seeing in her room when I was so small...  That way, you can think of it as a gift from him. Everyone loves gifts!  Or, just realise that its good to be sad. Can you imagine not having him close to you for so long? It just shows that you are really close to him, still. So yeah. Thats all I got. Be happy! It will always be okay in the end.

That actually makes me feel better. You'll have your good days and you'll have your bad days. I wish you luck hunny and just try and be around the people that love you.

The only advice I can really give is about that is for you to always remember that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Even though thinking of your grandfather now might make you cry, eventually when you think of him you'll be able to smile and remember all the good memories you had. Just know that your grandfather is watching over you and he wants you to be happy in your life.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Remember all the good times, allow yourself to cry, think about him, and even talk about it to others.

Feel better =)|`|psNeAz1Xaa	oh, i'm so sorry.  my prayers go out to you and your family at this difficult time.   think of all of the happy times you've had together, and think of how he is out of all his pain and he is happy and youthful again. don't be afraid to cry.    you know, everyone says that somebody "dies", when they go to heaven. i don't look at it like that. you don't die. if you think about it, WE are the ones that are dead. they say you haven't LIVED until you've been to heaven. :)|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	I lost my hubby my soul mate in may of last year and i know exactly what you are going through. its very hard but you can do it. IT is lucky he didn't hae to go too long with this dementia that is so horrible and they sometimes get mean. you are knowing that he is in the better place hes with God and hes happy his soul is at peace nothing to worry about no clothes to worry about food nothing. hes as complete happy as they come and you will do it also. you have to take one day at a time and just think of the good things of him it will get dimer and dimmer and things will lok better. you will see. it took me 9 mos to really get the grief out and if you want to cry then by all means cry. its good for you to let your feeings out and show them so what people will get over it and for your own good health you do it. its for you that you just keep his memories and they are yoours only remember that. he will be waiting for you when you leave this world, he will be there waiting for you and you can remember that there is a good book to read it did help me its called 90 minutes to heaven. this minister was dead that long and came back. its a godo story and i am catholic and its still very good and his life has changed it took him long time to get back but he did and you shodl read it it tells about heaven and the place it is. there are animals there also and when you pass you can see them there. its a place where you are happy and nothing bothers you i know its hard right now to understand but as you get older you will learn its ok to cry and its ok to be sad but your time will com and you will see how great God is.|`|9YfhGWMMaa	First off, I'm really sorry)': My grandpa passed away too about 2 months ago and I was really depressed for awhile and no matter how hard I try not to cry, I just do. That's why I kept wearing sunglasses for awhile. Just visit his grave as much as you can and talk to him in your head because your grandfather is listening. God bless you and may your grandfather rest in peace):|`|FVccN5IYaa	always remember the good times you had with him and remebeer he lived a pretty full life and maybe it was just his time to go its not easy but think of him and i dont know your belief system isbut he will miss you as much as you miss him hes just better off where he is at now.. god bless and good luck|`|NTNsJdyHaa	well my mom died last july from cancer and the best advice that i can give you is that its ok to look back on the good time and the bad but dont stay turned around or you'll fall flat on your face. it' ok to fell bad for not knowing how much you loved then untill there gone. (cry every once and a while it helps a lot.)|`|g10lDZnGaa	I am tearing, I don't know how to deal with this. I don't have any experience but I will try anyways.

You can remember the nice memories you have of him, you can write about it, especially the fun things you experienced or learned from him.  You can also honor him by living a good wonderful life being true to yourself and those around you. :)  Bless You.  And remember it is perfectly fine to feel ok and then a few days later very sad.  Deal with emotions as they come they are completely natural.|`|xe3DPFbjaa	Listen, it's very painful but healing is coming. First of all sweetie, never hold feelings to yourself.  It's just like damaging yourself. Please discuss with your parents about how you are feeling. And  think of good memories you had with him. Write a letter so you can read in  the funeral. The good times or sad times. Write or discuss with your parent to learn more about your grandfather when he's younger. You have my sympathy.|`|PJyrWmdfaa	Don't think of it as he died. Just know that he went to a retirement home. Where nurses don't abuse their patients and he's jumping around and just waiting for you to come with him soon. But not too soon. He's still waiting.     It's also Easter tomorrow so you know there will be a big celebration with their host Mr. Jesus.     The only thing that upsets him now is that he has to wait like 100 more years so you can join him.
XH2o1MM6aa	.You don't mention why he's your X..He's still the same guy. Nothings changed.So did you dump him?.That could explain his attitude.Your unfinished business and hurt his ego.He may be genuine or just want to get even.You know better when you meet.Just tread carefully.For now.
3vnayfR7aa	I enjoy guys that are able to pick me up with relative ease.    And also aren't disgustingly muscular but do look nice with their shirt off.    ;)|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	You asked two different questions so I'll answer them both. Being in shape matters but that shape doesn't have to be thin. You don't have to be tight to turn heads but you do have to be well kept. Dieting and exercise should be motivated by a personal desire to look a certain way. That personal desire should not be motivated by someone else's opinion of you. It is worth it to be health and weight conscious to a degree because no one will want to build a relationship with you when its obvious because of your habits that you may die early. So, yeah.. it's worth it but for yourself.    A lot of women say that looks don't matter but you know that's not true because there are plenty of guys- nice guys- who get rejected a lot. The truth is, for women that have actually had sex before, will not look towards a big dude to get with because she'll probably think he'll be short winded and if he has a big stomach, access to his dick will be limited. I know that's not true because my husband is a big guy. Before I met him, I was grossed out at the thought of having sex with a big guy- or more specifically having to see him naked. As our relationship progressed into a romantic one, I began to develop an open mind so that by the time we had sex, I was blown away. Everything that I thought about big guys and sex was thrown out the window. He disproves every negative comment I've heard about big guys so for some women shape doesn't matter. To some others, shape does matter but they're open minded enough where you could prove them wrong. And then you have some who absolutely won't get with a big guy.|`|t0uIgY08aa	honestly  do most girls it doesn't matter. But here is the thing if you 5'3 and weigh 300 pounds then most likely your not going to get looked at. Try and keep a good shape. If a girl seems to take care of herself then really what she wants is a guy that takes care of himself.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	probably    looks are what people first notice about a person|`|A2u06IS1aa	thats soo not true. Im like 20 lbs underweight. People think that i eat healthy, but i have extremely bad eating habits. I think that being overweight is better than being underweight :\|`|5xvXOj1Saa	does it mater to be in shape yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: It depends on a girl :.    .: But I like my man in a good shape because   I'm concern about his health and well being :.    .: You don't have to be all muscular w/o body fat,  you just have to be on the average scale to keep up with girls :.    .: We like going shopping & hitting the malls you know :.    .: Plus people who workout regularly seems to be happier :.    .: I hope this helps :.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	It doesn't matter that much. Girls just like guys who treats them with respect ?|`|Pswqhimoaa	well. I think obesity is gross, for the simple fact that it has to do with your lifestyle. i would not date a guy who sat around and ate sweets and fast food. I don't like that type of stuff, so why would i date a guy like that?    I mean, i don't expect my boyfriend to be muscular and have a model's body, since my boyfriend is a stick. skinnier than me! haha.  I just don't want my guy to be obese. :/|`|IQfaj1BGaa	well its healthier :]|`|60NJNjEpaa	it depends on the person.  i have friends that date, are engaged to, and even married to men that are considered medically overweight.  i prefer men that are somewhat fit.    it shows me that they care about their bodies and personal health.|`|AA11914352	Yes it does matter been in shape makes people feel good of themselves and feel sexy.|`|cmlomNUxaa	i like a guy how can pick me up easily.|`|aheO01Fgaa	I think it is good to be in shape...but for your personal health. No one should judge you if you are over weight! When I look for a bf i look for someone who has a good personality and can mesh with me. I don't look at their looks or weight! Plus, always remember that the better self image you have of yourself the better looking you are! ;)|`|4JqwBJTSaa	Honestly , as long as your not like over 500 pounds it doesnt matter to me. I am 190 and 13. So i know what it i like being fat.        As long as there really a great person I don't care.     And of course females are gonna want to have sex with a very attractive man before they have sex with an obese person.       But would you ather choose a 700 pound girl or a playboy bunny?  I would still have sex with an obese person though. Love is the only thing that matters!|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	idk i'm not a girl.... but i would say yes.... would u date a obese girl....probably not.|`|MBqoeaEJaa	its totally worth it to be healthy and fit.......seriously anyone tell you otherwise YOU TELL THEM TO GO HIT THE GYM!|`|AA11310070	Being in shape matters- or rather, making sure you take care of yourself.  Being obese shows that you probably have unhealthy eating habits.|`|7sxGW40qaa	It all depends on the girl.  Some girls like chubby guys, but if you are really fat, go to the gym.  I personally like a little pudge, and I also like the skinny skinny guys if they are nice.|`|cd79bc55584f59c7b466769fea7b719aaa	Do you look at fat girls or slender girls?  Physical attraction plays a large role in initial impression.      If you are fat, lose weight.  It is healthier for you.    A buff guy who is a jerk will still get more dates, but personality will win out in the end.|`|Uc1Mzo3Faa	Mmm muscular guys are definately a turn on, but there's nothing wrong with guys who aren't in shape. When it come down to it, girls want a guy with an amazing personality and sense of humor, looks are just some of the perks. lol. And if a girl only wants so be with a guy for his body, then she probably isn't the right kind of girl to be with.|`|gew4KVFfaa	i HATE fat guys. i think it is a HUGE turnoff. and fat ppl tend to be really emotional and just plane losers. i dont like hanging around with negative ppl.|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Well, to some people it does. But most, it's w/e.    =)|`|f92f4c895d75cb0a24f4ea612297712eaa	no I dont think it matters.....|`|rOv1wowLaa	dude most likely girls would want someone who has a nice body, not exactly ripped or incredibly amazimng but u kno something nice, fat guys can get girls too but its alot easier if ur in good shape and look good, u can still look good and eat a bunch of crap just be active and dont go over the top with eating....and of course a better body would help with sex...JUST DO IT!!!!!!|`|gXR7J785aa	No, it doesnt matter.  its WHO you are on the inside that matters. You'll find love, no matter what your body is.|`|M8MlviOFaa	look it really not about the weight, its about the curves.. so yes shape is what matters. i wouldnt date ya if your really skinny or obese. but as long as you have a womans figure, you are a very special catch|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Its not so much looking all buff that turns me on (even though it is nice to look at and fun to have sex with) its about the discipline that being in shape represents. You know that someone has committed time and energy into being healthy and to me that is admirable. It shows not only discipline, but strength, endurance, commitment, and determination. Its not easy to work out and sustain a healthy lifestyle. And when I see someone that is in good shape, they look happy and they look healthy and that's what turns me on. There are some extreme people that eat, sleep, breath the gym and that's completely unattractive. However, I prefer male/female that likes to keep themselves healthy and full of energy as opposed to someone that cant do anything besides go to the gym.|`|5WB2yZUFaa	hate to say it, but yes it matters, unless she's a chubby chaser. the sex isn't good unless you're physically attracted to the man. when i was single i would never have looked at an obese man and thought, "damn, i'd like f*** him" because i'm not attracted to fat men. but on the other hand, if my husband got really fat, i'd still suck his ****, and be happy to do it. so initially, i repeat, yes, it does matter.|`|f5aa73943f8ed364c73587e542d735d9aa	Not as much as some men think. Personality matters the most. Seriously. I am tall, so for me height is another major requirement. I also look for someone that can make me laugh and that does not allow awkward silences to happen regularly.     There are only certain guys that I will be attracted to, but that is based on their style, not their muscle mass or overall level or fitness. Style tells you a lot about a person. Hair, clothing, and shoes are very important to women, so we will only be attracted to men that we feel dress well and that we feel suit ourselves and our lifestyles. That doesn't mean a suit and tie, it just means a style that matches ours. Do you like beachy girls? Girly-girl preppy types? Alternative tattooed women? Business professionals? Most likely your wardrobe will attract a matching type of woman.      I personally would never be attracted to a guy that spent all day at the gym and had a bunch of muscles. That would seem overly vain to me. Not every woman wants an Abercrombie model - I know that I definitely do not want this look for myself or my man.     I like a bigger guy myself, so I prefer a guy being a little bit overweight, but not crazy fat. I do not like a perfectly toned body because guys like this tend to want their woman to get up at 5:00am and go jogging before work etc. I do not want to do this so I do expect a man to do this either. If you are really into fitness like this then I suggest meeting a potential love match at the gym because most women just want a man's man and not someone that is overly concerned with the way they look. I do not think any guy that cares too much about his appearance would be attractive to most women. Sometimes I see guys like this and I think they are not straight because most straight men do not care too much about their body fat % etc.     Health and fitness in encouraged, but not in excess, you know? I hope this is helpful!|`|PiygwqNhaa	um we'd all like to say it doesn't but in reality yeah it does. usually it's just a complete turn off even if you're a really good guy you wouldn't get the same chance as a really hot guy with a nice bod. its just the way it is. confidence is key though.   but that's just my opinion, i might just be a total ***** lol|`|jFxMRMkTaa	you know what they say, when you have a nice body your dick is halfway inside of her already    edit: stealyfill, I second that, good question Sir!    edit:edit: I would date a girl with a little bit more meat on her than a skinny girl or the model type, not too chubby, not too light though...just the right amount is sexy for me!    but no, obese women are turn offs|`|Oz0JMbOoaa	good question sir|`|rp7ghi4Uaa	you feel full of energy when you exercise.  You aren't embarrased about ur body.  and you get laid.  Eating poorly and not exercising makes you feel tired all the time|`|KPKv5hwqaa	yes, I know that I would rather date an in-shape guy. Just my opinion.|`|11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	I can't speak for all girls, but I personally would rethink about a guy if he was no longer overweight. The physical attraction & mental attraction have to even out, for most people.|`|kTrEQhqraa	I would say yes even tho I'm not a chick........  my girlfriend seems to think so|`|lVe280fFaa	maybe because it is cute or hot guys that we go after. We just like them. not sure. But if you are retarded and want to know why women do female things, that is why. and don't be sexist about it, please.|`|2AypR39vaa	It just depends man. To some girls it really matters and to some it doesn't. Look at it this way do you find fat chicks attractive? Someone who is fat, their body reflects their lifestyle. Lazy and boring. So to a certain extent it does matter. You don't have to be a body builder, but as long as your not fat or too chubby your good. Being in shape never hurts though. It does make anybody look more attractive.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Well as much as I hate to admit it, I check a guy out before I get to know him - so looks come first for me I guess. The guy doesn't have to be so in shape with abs and everything he just has to have a nice clean face and not be obese, I just expect average. I don't expect a built man or anything =) And I think chubby faces are cute - as long as the guy is not fat I'd like him. Not that I don't like fat guys I mean like as in potential boyfriend material.|`|pqlhPnexaa	I know that this isn't a popular answer, but if a guy is fat, I'm not even going to consider dating him. I've met some lovely people online and through texting and ****, but if I meet them and they're significantly overweight... I would not even think about him as anything more than a friend.    A little bit overweight is fine, but if it's so much that you're obviously "fat," then... NO.|`|EfpM5KdSaa	for girls it makes a difference how you present yourself. 1st off if you act like your too much into yourself with always working out and trying to look goo for yourself then its a turn off even if you look good    also i think media enforces the idea in girls that the guy has to be fit. not have a six pack all the time but not flabby. you'll notice that college guys have a lot of lab because they drink too much. shows they don't take care of themselves.    some guys like muscular girls, others liek girls who look like they run once in a while (flat stomach) and other times a little mass just means she doesnt care what people think but also doesnt go overboard in eating her feelings type thing.    exercise says a lot about a person. maybe its not the real message but it still sends one to the girls. bottom line: care about being in shape but not overly care about it. just as long as you don't let alcohol or fast food control ur tummy    hope that helped  please answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...      oh also if your not in shape or work out once in a while u can get heart problems or breathing problems and the list goes on and that doesnt nessicarily mean very over weight, it could just be slightly over weight when u start 2 get those problems|`|9dF0sgjEaa	sure it matters. there's only handful of people who look at obese women and find it attractive. if a girl is only a little bit over weight that doesn't matter too much as long as she has nice curves. the only problem is- is that she thinks shes not pretty because shes just that bit over weight.    a lot of girls even if they are skinny feel like they have to be skinner. It's a disease. When a skinny girl says shes fat in front of another girl who may just be a tad bigger, the other girl thinks she fat as well. Then that girl will say something about her weight and the whole thing repeats.     Girls are never happy with themselves.  even the ones who seem most confident|`|u5yCeyYSaa	would you date a fat chick? its pretty much the same with girls most do not like really fat guys but not so buff its gross. like most guys like girls that are not a fence pole but are not a house same idea|`|0Vvk3iNSaa	It is naturally more appealing to many people, but i think you should do all of those things for you.   If you don't already, you seriously are putting your life at risk.   Not exercising and eating badly is just as bad for you as smoking, sometimes worse.  All of this is really easy to do, too.   Read nutrition facts, trying to stay away from fatty/sugary foods, and following the food pyramid.  Joining your local YMCA is also great. They're easy to join, and they offer a variety of fun classes. Try going once a day.  It also really helps to walk, rather then drive or take the bus. Its better for the environment and for you.  I know this was way off topic, but this kind of stuff worries me. People die from a lifestyle without proper nutrition and exercise. If you get in shape, not only will you save your life, but confidence, energy, and I'm sure a few women will come on the way.

80c2f9ef7e1feb2c0d3b25030692c796aa	Hi,    If anyone knew the answer to this question they could sell the magic formula and make a squillion.    I have been in "lust" heaps of times but in "love" only a few few times.    Each time was different. Each person I loved was for a different reason. The way they made me feel when I was with her. The way she made me feel whan I she wasnt. One I loved because she was my best friend. Another because of the things she did. Another was her touch. Another because she told me she loved me every day. Another because she didnt and made me fight her for her affections.    My uncle and aunty have been married for 56 years. Thier daughter for 32. Thier first born grandson for 2 but he married his first "real" girlfriend of seven years. Myself, I was married only for 2. My father was married 3 times. My mother was his second marriage.    When you meet the right person, you will know. If he is the last thought on your mind before you close your eyes to sleep and the first thought when you wake up..thats a pretty good indication, in my opinion.    Your behaviour will change, your friends will notice something "different" about you. Your outlook on matters will alter. You might be "sick" in your tummy or feeling anscious when you think of that person. Its all different but you will know.    Have you got a pet?..if so watch how they react to you when you pat them or feed them or when they just want a cuddle..thats unconditional love.    Just dont go looking for it...it will never happen or you will meet the wrong sort of person.    All the best in your journey......|`|AA11035799	Sorry to say but it just happens|`|c5064d85b689da3a6d38f6486a953c1caa	A few drinks and a good dinner!|`|0a181d6e420016c2a5b56b76c626b26eaa	You know your in love when you think of that one person 24/7 and always have a smile on your face when you think of that person or hear there name. You also get that butterfly feeling in your stomach when you see them and get nervous when you talk to them. that's in the beginning and than if you guys date longer you will still feel that unconditional feeling of love for them and caring.|`|55954ca70139c448a3fd390f0e958617aa	it  is  own  its  own     u  never     know   in  advance|`|e2c690ddc7c3fbd3ce8ba8373a8e12d3aa	it comes up and bites you in the ***!!!!!!!!  lol    like you start thinkin about them  and then a lil more and then alot and then all you want to do is be with them . i think its more self inflicked lol i love my gf lol|`|acecf70725499ae16e2c4e90b6d06ea9aa	Passion and Lust just happen.

It could be caused by jealousy.    If your problem is just your friend telling her about the "stupid" stuff you do, it really doesn't sound like something serious. From that perspective, it doesn't seem like his mother hates you.|`|95a214f67f6ed7f6ebd70ace5aa56e78aa	see deeper to yourself if you have this traits that makes your friends momm get mad.Avoid saying nonsense words maybe that irritates her.Ask your friend what irritates her mom!|`|ec58e0b1bfcd59b51636056962684878aa	maybe he isn't really a good friend because he tells his mom stuff about you that will make you look bad in her eyes|`|d93569f577829db1c895d0867a499a44aa	I would worry more about the "friend" than the mother...

cfd629454428a62c17f3a2bb85a96110aa	Because we are honestly thinking about nothing.    Not like when you ask a girl what is wrong, and she says "nothing, which actually means "everything you jerk".    With a guy, "nothing" means "nothing". Stop searching for hidden meanings in everything we say. We're not as complicated as you.|`|AA10739773	Sometimes, he means it; other times, he rather not say it because it might be something very perverted that he was thinking about. However, I'm not a guy, but that's what my boyfriend said when I asked him...it's fun to read each other's minds once in awhile.|`|cdee59d0e8d3e66b437a7b6bd5e00237aa	OMG not this again...  While "nothing" is probably not accurate, it basically means "nothing in particular".  It could be any random string of thoughts in a row that don't really matter like gee that floor doesn't seem level right there and what ever happened to that hammer of mine and I hear a fly buzzing somewhere and...   And then the "What are you thinking about?" interrupts it and most people can't remember what they were thinking about.      Or, he's trying to figure out if you would marry him and when/how to ask and how many kids..., y'know, "nothing in particular"   :D|`|e8682ff16025b0333174691b84e2e83eaa	The answer is women you got him so scared that he doesn't want to say the wrong thing y'all hurt us physically & mentaly by what ya'll call( cut off) so we develop (don't start none want be none)|`|AA11766242	Is this like what 'is' is?

AA11912708	16 years older, and we are very happy together.|`|AA11472558	My BF is 20 years older (I'm 27) and I can't imagine my life without him. (Still going strong after a year and a half!!)  We are on the same level in so many ways - maturity, goals, opinion, etc. Like any relationship, it comes down to a balance of give & take, acceptance, and respecting each other. I believe people come into our lives for a reason, and we learn and grow from them. Being in love is the greatest feeling in the world and age shouldn't stop anyone from experienceing it.

AA11740824	Offer her some mints or gum, if she refuses just kindly say, honey you really do need something for your breath right now. That shouldn't offend her. If she has bad breath all the time then there is something wrong. It could be gum disease or something to do with her stomach. Certain medications can also cause bad breath. Also, a zinc deficiency. Really the majority of people in a relationship would rather their partner tell them about their bad breath. IF done in the right manner. NOT saying your breath smells like poop. lol|`|AA12063319	No matter how you tell her she is going to be embarrased about the situation. There is no easy way, it is going to be hard. I am sure that she is aware of the problem, if so, do some research on the internet at medlineplus or other site with medical advice. Before you talk to her about it, Know what you are talking about so it won't be so akward for her. Good luck|`|AA11399175	Seriously, just tell her.....politely.

It's not so much my desire, but I want him to be open with me in regards to sex.  And because some of you guys have a hard time telling us what you like, it can help us to figure out what you like best.|`|AA10616264	Women are now more into sensuality and visual stimulation as opposed to tactile stimulation that they are traditionally associated with. I say the more senses you open someone to be stimulated by the more sensual they will be, and that always makes for better sex|`|64fb6cbeb273cd83fbcbd70763c230e6aa	are most girls you date now asking for them or is it only her?  It could be just her who is into porno.  but since it's 2006 now, many people have casual attitudes towards porno, including women.  Before, people (especially girls) were ashamed that they liked porno secretly.  But now, many people aren't ashamed to admit that they like to watch a good porno every now and then.  i think some girls were always into porno, they just always denied that they were into that stuff.  this girl was probably requesting some hot dvds to help her get into the mood.  maybe she's not getting enough help from you to get her in the mood.|`|6186d40a995785ba918069c9681b00adaa	im not even going to lie....i love porn and always have. i love watchn it with my man..... we are freaks too and we do like to do kinky sh*t! i think its great that we can sit there and reinact the scenes.

AA10438766	Just start up an innocent conversation with the guy, talk about anything and everything. Once you feel comfortable enough with just talking to him, and you know that he is listening, then just tell him how you feel. If he gets creeped out by it, then he's not worth it, if he says he just wants to be friends, then except it. But the worst that could happen is he'll run away, which if he is as good of a guy as you may think he'll stick around. No harm ever came from taking a chance! Good luck!!|`|AA10841601	Expressing interest in a person can take a lot of forms.  Think about it.      People have all kinds of aspects to them: 1) the clothes they wear; 2) the things they read; 3) the sports they play; 4) the games they are into; 5) the classes they take.    If you like a guy - telling him you like him is abrupt - isn't it?  That's why is seems "creepy" or, another word to use is: dissonant.  That's actually the right term for what you feel.  It's like fingernails on a chalkboard, right?    Well that's the feeling when two parts of your brain clash with each other - the emotional side and the computational side.   The emotional side (the limbic brain) draws you toward this guy.  The computational side is making your plan to keep him near you (the neocortical brain).      So what's the solution?  Well, get near him.  Just smile.  That's a start.  If you feel uncomfortable, well, then giggle a little.  He'll certainly pick up on your vibe.  But then he might not know what to do next.  And that's where small talk comes in.    Compliment anything he is into and has obviously put some passion (i.e. love) into:  his appearance, his backpack, his music selections, his sports efforts, his reading interests.  Compliment those things and getting him talking with you about them.    That small talk is not about talking - it's about being near, physically, another person.  There is a vibe, it's not imaginary, and it binds people together.  Get that vibe going and he's going to follow you anywhere....like a puppy dog, no kidding.  Actually, just like a puppy, because the limbic brain is the part of the mind that we share with dogs and cats, and it's the reason we relate to them so lovingly.    OK.  you have the secret.  Have a good time.    Oh and remember this..if he doesn't reciprocate, don't worry about it.  We all have different "frequencies" and if his isn't yours, don't worry.  Someone will click with you - and it'll be great!|`|fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the hardest things to do can be to tell some guy that you like him. Why?    The bottom line is, it's the fear of rejection - we ask people other questions all the days of our lives.    Therefore in order to ask the question, you have to study what's the worst that could happen. And that is the answer "no".    But there is nothing really to fear in the word no - it just means that he doesn't value you (his loss) or just doesn't think you are compatible (best to find out now) or he is seeing someone else (fair enough).    Hope this helps~|`|9b1d751c983ba0c5e9d7a12056f26db4aa	If you are cute it wont be creepy.  If you are fat and or ugly, then don't ask.

AA12244201	It is so heartbreaking to watch someone go through this, especially when you see how confident, intelligent, and capable they are without these dispicable men.  These women don't feel they deserve any better, and even though they can present a confident exterior, deep down they have a very low self-esteem.  I think all you can do is try and urge her to get some counselling, but she may not realize she has a problem being attracted to abusive relationships.  It sounds like it is tearing you up inside, and unfortunately if you choose to remain friends with her, it will be a long hard road ahead.  Aside from being there for her through all this, all you can really do is try and get her some professional help.  I wish you the best, and leave you with a website:    http://www.aaets.org/article58.htm|`|AA12268509	it's hard but ask her does she love herself cause if she does then ehy does she keep doing this to herself. men are pigs and hurt women just because they think they're stonger and we are weaker. ask her what's more important he rlife or getting beat up and are you more important than her husband. cause a good friend like you shouldn't be bothered with her. that's her business if she wants to keep getting beatup.|`|AA11356589	You really have no control but You might sit down with her and tell her how you see the situation.

She is in an abusive relationship.  However, unless, she admits it there is nothing you can do.  I would try talking to her and help her understand what her husband is doing is wrong, not her to her but to the child.  It is very unhealthy for the 3 year old to be put in that position.  She needs to think about her child before she thinks about herself.|`|AA12185295	its her decision, really, is she not strong enough to stand up to him??? or does she just not want to lose him???|`|AA10255121	girl my friend is going through the same thing only this guy is 10x crazy.

They completely turn their lives into their spouses. Its not good but the personality of your friend is probably like that ... submissive. Its like being a Alcoholic, they do it because they crave it (in a way). She is in a comfort zone in which she can't leave because she knows no other way .... she is scared to change. Scared to face her life is plain slavery. She is scared to lose her man ... these are all things that she is going through.     Her husband, as *** or coarse because mocking your spouse on their dominant ways can only lead to worst things. If she ever stood up to him (especially in front of his friends) it could have disastrous consequences .... be careful.    What she needs right now is a friend to take her to lunch, dinner and other activities that show that there is life out that Rather than her dominating husband.    I have others that I have talked to that have gotten out of these relationship and others that have made a stand and the husband completely turned around... because ... in some cases, the husbands do love them and will do anything not to lose them.     I pray that this is the situation with your friend. It can't be healthy for her.    Good luck, be a friend right now and treat her to lunch!|`|AA11730296	How long were they together for. if not to long.  then she needs to get the hell out of that relationship .Because it start off with him controling her an them he'll start beating her an then her kids.

Though definitely not right.|`|bada5b78051ca6bb744207f5aaa8d9f4aa	Well, things could be worse. I understand why you worry about her, and that makes you a really good friend. Have you tried talking to her? I am really sorry to say though, as much as you may want to help... it may not work. You can't help someone who isn't willing to help themselves. So first, try getting her to see how this is wrong.
b83fc5cda3436598398157d400cd0ef1aa	Communication is the root of all relationships, it can make you or break you.  First you all need to scrap being upset with one another it's in the past.  Second you all should do something together like a movie, or dinner, or night out on the town.  Then lastly but most importantly,  take a nice hot bath or shower together and make up!  You always have to make up after a big fight, then things should be back to normal.|`|AA10530214	call him  to say youre sorry and you love him duh|`|421b1247395dca6ee67c1d6b736731a7aa	Sincerely apologize.  Tell him how important this relationship is to you and that you realize it is too important to waste the love by bickering... and that you will find better ways to voice your frustrations.|`|a93be4c3e8653ed55bc99c1f81f9484eaa	that depends on what the fall out was over. With out getting too personle , if it was an argument about another girl u need to let him know that if u got jeaouse its because of how u feel for him and u dont want to lose him, its not that u dont trust him (wether u do or not dont tell him u dont, males hate hearing that!) it's just that u dont want him realising what he could have with some 1 else, is this making sence?    if it was about another guy and he was the one that got jealous, u need to understand how he feels and put urself in his shoes. He probably is scarred of loosing u and is maybe a bit insecure. try to be understanding and listen to one another rather than shouting or talking over the top of each other.    If its because you're always nit picking at each others little annoying habbits that, deep down u really know aren't worth worrying about then just apologise wether its ur falt or not.    At the end of the day , in my oppinion a relationship is aboiut feeling happy with one another, not about arguin because it feels good to make up.     Good luck :) x|`|AA11711375	leave him alone, he's a guy not a pansy! let him suck it up. sometimes you gotta be a b*tch to keep your man on his toes.

AA11647156	There was a good line in the show "Sportsnight"..."I can understand why a woman thinks any man is better than nothing.  I just can't understand why a woman would think that she has nothing" (or something like that).  Don't do this to yourself-everybody is unique and deserving of respect.      Maybe he doesn't like you and just isn't stand-up enough to say so.  That's his problem.  If nothing else, that should mean he's too immature for a relationship anyway.  Don't be angry, just let it go.  Otherwise you're allowing his immaturity to be your problem as well.    Maybe he does like you and has some excuse.  But actions speak louder than words.  Don't let him sweet talk his way out.  If you truly let it go, you'll stand ready to accept him if he approaches, and you'll be in a good spot if he doesn't.    Also, don't play games.  It's much easier when you're honest: it's better for you (because you don't have to worry if you 'played it right'), and it's better for us guys, because we're generally pretty clueless.|`|AA12082377	Don't get crazy too fast....Maybe he has a good excuse for not calling.|`|AA10727617	he has no interest, move on|`|001f15ceefdb34f06b69ee6964deb75caa	Ya never know what the problem is but I wouldn't stress over it any more.  Perhaps he will come around.  Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.  There are a great many men that can appreciate a warm hearted person.  Wait to see what happens and give your heart to someone else.    Sounds kind of like a jerk to me.  Don't change your schedule.  Do what you planned to do unless it was taken off to be together.  Then again still take the day off.|`|6e7a09d741a0bb89616f79ccb9cbe5b5aa	He probably doesn't like you.  You seem the type that talks too much and certainly over analyses situations.  If he wants to see u, he'll call.  Stop being clingy.|`|48745d4c883711898e4f4497ed7f1fd8aa	Maintain your cool. Stop calling him you will seem desperate and needy. If a guy says he will call, let him call do not make excuses for him. I think the guy was playing around with you that is why he did not answer your calls.|`|1bf7ce657876a6f30c54f0ff4d67f8d8aa	do not rush into relationship  always give more time to understand each other better|`|AA11141524	Problem is you didn't put out.....pretty obvious really|`|e20ac0d564a7c80bc45b0f73c27f752baa	okay.. well boys will be boys.. they never call.. so maybe he forgot.. or maybe it was a joke... but i dont think thats the thing... i think he called and you didnt know.. and he thinks you are not answering his call.. i think thats it.. i hope it works out for you.|`|aa547d9d9e798f7a56ced3043a517df2aa	maybe this guy thinks of you only as a friend and not as a gf...he might have felt that you've been pushing too hard and he might have been "afraid" of that.  or simply he forgot to call you and he couldnt reply you when you phoned....  well if you keep avoiding him you'll never know why he didnt call you...my advice to you is to go to work the day you should have and act as if nothing happened...just be as you have always been...he probably needs some time! give him his space and try to find out if he likes you as a friend or girlfriend!  Best of Luck!remember not to let him know you were sad or disappointed...you're strong and you'll make it!  if he's nt the one for you...there are other guys waiting for you out there!|`|b21ed9d0ff71cf707efa33aee06b1437aa	okay I honestly know the feeling. Dear, you need to take a deep breath...stand or sit up straight and tell yourself he is not the kind of guy you want to give another minute to. Since you work together you must go to work...but do not inconvenience your schedule for this guy...you are just boosting his ego. Just imagine how he would treat you if you two were involved...worse. I seriously think you need to hold better self-esteem. This guying is not seeing you as a strong independent women...instead a vulnerable...needy lady. I  realize what I am saying sounds like men love cruel women...but what I want you to know is you are being toooo kind.   Delete his number from your phone and let him go...it's easier now before your in to deep.|`|6c4980cb3216494e9f292d40bc0c9d4daa	First of all, How old are you?  If you don't mind me asking.

Being able to hang out w/the guys.  6. Not being a nag.  7. Girl-next-door pretty... (silicone and whore paint are great on a night out, but in the morning if you don't look good in natural lighting... the dude is probably gonna chew his arm off like a trapped coyote to escape waking up next to a wildebeast who is snuggling up to him).    Umm... I think that's it.|`|AA11190035	first thing to to judge on a girl is the appearance, it gives the first impression, it does not have to be looking good, if she is looking normal and having a wonderful personality and a sweet hear, she would be perfect, also the ability to please her boy friend, like having the same hobbies and stuff, is good, a girl friend should also trust her boyfriend and make him know that she is proud to be with him,be like an open book for him, do not hide anything, try to think about the things he did for you to make you happy, all of that stuff counts in the relation, if it is taken care of, the relation will never end|`|b7fe8b4932e3662d0d39e94a8bfd2abaaa	we like how they are i like how you are its me a give me you email for yahoo or another one mine is westside_13babyblue@yahoo.com|`|64aded2c76f93dbf153297458b36a10daa	a nice bigg *****

I'd say half the length of your relationship from the time you broke up is safe. Dated for a year? 6 months. Dated for a two months? 1 month.|`|sQ4tvYUbaa	You may want to go with your ex's friend but he won't go for you.  Code  1: Bros before hos.

AA11741086	Don't "go" for your ex's friend...why?...lots of reasons...are you trying to make your ex jealous with his friend?...he is your ex's friend which means your ex may have shared stuff with him which means he may use you like your ex did...no matter what, it's always better to start a relationship where both people are starting with a clean slate...if the guy knows personal things about you or is friends with the guy that use to be with you, it may affect how he handles his relationship with you.|`|k3ZnmA8Laa	the one thing I learned is never ever date a friend of your ex.

Be specific.|`|4fffb488e63c1f5173afd0c2ac0c0582aa	Um i get what your saying. Feminism huh?    Well my personal opinion is, you should talk to   a woman the way men talked to women in the 50s.  Very respectfully, never gratuitous, and always treating  her like a lady. And never expecting any sexual favors out of   her.    a good book is    " A Return to Modesty"  By wendy shalit|`|3aba8b2526f576d1038e03dc288ec4aaaa	What are you talking about?|`|1b434695fe09e8f9b838d10009fc4759aa	yes!    There too smart for us, we are just a bunch of dumb apes, don't you watch T.V.?    You want girls you lie all the time without question, it works!  You want to die a miserable death in doctors hands a hopeless romantic - start by telling a women that you love her, then spilling your guts about yourself and watch them run away and leave adds on the Internet how they want someone to talk to, someone who is honest.      Trust me it doesn't work,  the best solution is go on living life and if you keep your mouth shut one will bump into you when the chemicals in her brain are just balanced right, fall in love with you (even though your a mute) and you just may get a life before the third world war.    Its late and I obviously shouldn't be up|`|56ae7952c5bea528029082fa20db67b7aa	You're not allowed to ask me.|`|5d5f1b3076423850e06128a2e91f2854aa	Well i guess it depends who is the woman and what your wanting to talk about!!|`|AA10787125	NO, if you want to talk to her, you must submit a, "communication request form", you can get this from her best friend. Fill it out and return it to her best friend. once a month there is a meeting of all her friend's and female family member's, they will review your request, forward any question's they may have to you. Return the questioner to them, and they will review your answers at there next meeting. And they may or may not get back in touch with you.

(",)|`|AA10793254	Yes when I was a kid my cousin came over and we were wagging school and riding my horse around the yard.    My horse had a bad habit of holding his breathe (bloating his belly out) when I would put his saddle on. After I would tighten it up as much as I could, he would suck his stomach back in.     One day when my cousin was climbing on him to go for a ride, he did that to her and the saddle became loose and swung straight under his belly and the horse started walking off because the saddle was rubbing on his private parts and making him uncomfortable and my cousin was screaming and still hanging onto the saddle but upside down under the horse before she fell off on the ground.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	There is something wrong other than what u said here, its not a reason to say what he said because just u told him u like him, there is something else, think about it to know whats the real reason for him to say what he said, and its not because of sex. dont worry about that.    _K_|`|8Yf6YIHCaa	I don't think this kind of thing could work. If you both wanted it to, and you drove then maybe.  But even if you lived closer, some guys love the thrill of the chase. Once you're available, they might not want you.  Its typical of younger men / boys altough you didnt specify ages.  Respect yourself and don't let yourself be played by this type of man.  Good Luck...
1awiFO6paa	WELL it all depends  but  sure  just make sure u dnt run out of money
Fw78upNjaa	I say you go straight up and ask her what's happening. If she comes up with a stupid reason then maybe you need to think this friendship over.     However, if she she has an actual reason and that reason happens to be against you then you should apologize and ask her to forgive you.     Friendships are like any other type of relationship. It takes work and it really is all about give and take. If you think the friendship is worth it then take the fault and rebuild your relationship with her.     Hope I helped :)|`|AvE9vLufaa	You may have said something behind her back that you just don't remember but if you have a problem with her just be direct no matter how hurtful it is and tell her to do the same for you. Once you get stuff off your chest it makes it a whole lot better. When I was younger my friends and i used to fight all the time and it was because we talked behind each others backs. Now we just say it to each others faces and it makes it a lot easier. Also, it may help to apologize even though you don't know what you're apologizing for.|`|O9VW6RjEaa	let it go.  maybe you were annoying to her, and you just didn't know it.  if that's the case, she should have told you.  and maybe it's her,   mood swings?|`|lpldrzvDaa	i have been through what u went through  your best friend found some body else  so try and be the same person u were when u met here  and what made u to become friends  for more info  email  hamster270@gmail.com

You can say things like that, but always be yourself women like that, they don't like when a guy tries to be something or somebody that they're not. Because a guy like that to them is fake and won't give them the time of day.    So, just be there for her, comfort her, console her, ask her if she needs help with anything. You know, just be a man and look out for her.    I hope that helps !!!

The worst thing you can do if you like a girl is to hide it. It makes you feel bad and if SHE likes you, it makes her sad too.    You don't have to comfort her like hold her hand or put your arm around her shoulders or anything like that right off the get-go, but comfort her and wish her well. Complement her, or ask how her day has been to get her mind off things.    And no, most women that are worth a GOOD relationship will NOT like a guy that's a jerk.    Wish you luck!|`|AA11899313	You take the risk of 'sound weird' whatever you do ~ 'weird' is just a throwaway label those who are not capable of thinking use to dismiss what they cant be bothered with thinking about.

(especially if it happens all the time).  I'd want to know.    Also, if in person, you can ask her if there's anything you can do to help her feel better.  Girls love getting asked that question ;-)|`|np3y9CQtaa	just be like awww that really sucks :( im sorry u dont feel good...id give u a hug if i was with u right now =] ....then work your way into saying that ull give her a hug next time u see her and u will make it all better :)|`|yGc53HCLaa	Poor boy.

They were very racist and they were active skinheads.    I wanted to hang out with these people because they had some other qualities that I did like (hard to believe, but true) - however, ultimately their racism became too much for me - it was absurd. Literally these people would get mad at me if I sat down next to a person that was not white - it was insane.    Racism is just not acceptable, especially not in this day an age. Everything to the people I knew was about race. It was ridiculous. Anyway, I finally ditched this crowd and I have been much happier ever since.     Don't let anyone convince you that hating anyone based on what they look like is "cool" or that you should hate people for absolutely no reason, or just because they do. You will find out that thinking for yourself and being informed and educated is actually much better and that racist people like this are really just making fools of themselves.    I hope you find some new, more enlightened and informed friends.    Good luck to you!|`|T64RZp9oaa	I'd be mad at him at first, but I know I'd end up not being mad at him, just because I'm too forgiving and... he's my best friend.|`|8PWsiyv9aa	Smack him in the face, talk about how disgusting he is in a Russian accent, tell him nazis suck... hard. repeat over and over again that hitler blew.

Once he goes to another nazi meeting, declare war on him, take over the meeting place with U.S. Marines, yourself, your anti nazi friends, and throw him over the balcony into grass so he doesn't die, and has time to stop sucking hard. If he retaliates, go nuts, or preferrably talk 2 someone. OR MAYBE HE'S JUST PLAYING A JOKE ON YOU. or maybe it's just a phase. Either way, nazis suck... very, very,VERY hard.

I've been there for a year now and I've come to like it. I can sit back on Saturday and turn my phone off and read a book, instead of go to the mall with friends. When I do go out I try harder to seem normal, like I'm as immature. Sometimes wearing a smile gets tiring, but many people that you don't think do the same. It's a big part of life I've found out. So just try harder. Do what makes you have fun mostly, and for some friends try with them. But mostly be you, do what you want and have fun that way. People like people who don't try to be 'normal' a better.    hope i helped|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Just do whatever you are allowed to do, and have fun.

I honestly think you should get rid of him. He's not worth it; and if he doesn't wanna talk to you, or whatever, you seriously need to dump the stupid bastard.

8G0cr3ACaa	As a gemini woman, I can relate. The best thing to do is to give her space. When she's ready to talk about it, believe me she will. Us geminis tend to have constant mood swings and changes in attitude. So, she'll probably feel better about it soon. But for right now, just let her feel how she feels. And when she does decide to talk about it, listen and be supportive.|`|dT5jDb2waa	You can't force a person to open up, but what you can do is just be there for her.

He has a history of cheating, and he's obviously really good at it if he made you believe that you had something different.

The only person who deserves his company is him.|`|nJ8N5PJMaa	i think he is just a player and isnt worth your time|`|DDWNBc9waa	Sweetheart, it is NEVER worth it if a guy is already wanting someone else... dont even think about it anymore. move on! forget that asshole! find someone worthy of your time and energy (:|`|debe9fe3c4c8eebe80877283a92975f1aa	Its not my intention to be mean... but move on,  really, you really care about what this guy thinks  about you... this guy is a peace of crap. Guys like   these make the rest of us look bad! be more careful   in your next relationship, (keep em closed)...|`|M7r7gHNGaa	It doesn't matter if he misses you or likes her. His is a chronic cheater and you need to move on before you really get hurt. He told you that you needed to get on with things. You need to do that.|`|M1aXFtuUaa	your boyfreind is a douchebag, yup, hes a douchebag|`|1k6UUC8qaa	sorry i just think he doesn't feel for you or her it seems to me he want to be known as a player he sleeps casually with girls not taking their feelings into account. sorry dump this looser pretend you don't know him don't feel bad live and learn|`|T3b4I4kXaa	He sleeps with you, is jealous if you date anyone else, but continues to date other women... the guy is a player.   You are one of his "pit stops".   You should be embarrassed.  You kick this one to the curb and cut him off forever... block his phone and e-mail.    Next time, take time out to actually get to know the guy thoroughly before ever letting him stay the night with you. If he won't introduce you to his family, he is just trying to have sex with you.|`|NttRBr9Saa	im sry to say this but you need to try to get over him its the best thing to do im sry :[ i hope things get better for u
WsGO1QW2aa	its kind of hard to MAKE someone want to be with you constantly.  But, don't call her, text her, message her, whatever. Let her do it. I had that issue with my ex boyfriend. He was entirely independent and I on the other hand, am kinda clingy.|`|89YkHxMUaa	Stay reserved but not to reserved and if she comes to you she likes and if not she wasnt the one.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	wait for her to text you, call you, etc. seems like she likes the chase, so keep her chasing :P
9ddfdc881e051735e1a46a1543e65397aa	you only think you love her because she shows no interest about you anymore and that alone made you want her more but i think it wouldn't hurt to ask her out or go out with her and have good time as long as you keep it at that and know it to yourself that she might be not the right gurl for you. good luck.|`|SorcFv62aa	obama go here obama go there cecillian president with black hair|`|YZzT5rFraa	cheek is sweet btw try something less boring and non intimate go to the park or something.|`|TxgdMUvLaa	Okay, Lips, movies, take her, yes. Get a more romantic one. Don't get horror ones. She might end up on you.. or terrified. Get a comedy/romantic one.|`|9W3JUW2zaa	i mean dude  she played you kinda i guess  she ws after you   and then your friend    then she realized she cant have that   so she pratically came crawling back    you can do better i think|`|jChbnuafaa	Go to the movies     go to a scary movie so she gets scared and leans into you     kiss her on the lips!!!|`|IlmF2yXIaa	I would pursue her, but dont be too pushy, or clingy. if you know what i mean. and at the movies dont pull any moves unless she keeps the armest up. and offer to pay for her. and at the end ask for a hug, and kiss her lightly on the cheek, and if she is interested she might just kiss you on the lips. dont be too pushy because then she will be annoyed. and COMPLIMANT her whens he arrives at the movies.|`|KIvO8IDpaa	ok. first of all you have a really gay name. Alexander B? whats up with that. what are you, 10? anyway, she sounds like she would go out with you and probably kiss you but she likes the other guy. remember? so it will be for all the wrong reasons. i would pursue her really low key. try to win her with your charm and all that crap. just dont be all out there. girls hate that. and try to convince her that your beter than that other guy. that your awesome or whatever. and just kiss her. i mean its stupid asking that. its obvious. if you like her, kiss her. it doesnt matter if she likes you or not. us girls are up for a kiss from anyone ;)|`|z7MIZdaZaa	you are so young and i think that there are different stages of love, having been there myself i do understand how you feel. it sounds to me like you weren't really into her as more than a friends until she showed signs of interest to another. Be careful because these feeling u have can easily be misinterpreted. It is normal to want to feel love and experience those butterfly feelings that young love brings!    Just know that if she has feelings for your friend, it is a HUGE chance for heart ache for you. Dont let yourself get treated like a door mat, there when she needs you! make sure she really does care about you before taking the plunge.    And as far as the kiss goes, i would wait until the relationship develops into something more than a friendship. the worst thing you could do for yourself is try and kiss her before shes ready. you might feel the butterflies and she may not. or she may get mad at your attempt. make sure your on the same level of understanding like, maybe she thinks your hanging out as friends and you think there could be more!    Basically, make sure she understands that your interested and be positive that shes interested before the kiss.     Dont kiss her on the cheek, it is very sweet and romantic but is also a friendly gesture unless your already commited. I would go for a soft sweet peck on the lips, but ONLY if shes ready and interested in you
b7U7uoTpaa	Ejaculating is a sexual act.  It is a result of an orgasm.  It also comes out in a much smaller quantity.  Urine and feces are waste products created by your body.  The consumption of urine generally won't harm you.  The consumption of feces can kill you.  So one is an intimate act and the other two are bodily waste functions.  If you can't see the difference in them, you have problems.  That and little or no experience with sex.|`|QSodlfMraa	err what?  those are different things.  you sound like a prude to me not to be rude.|`|AA11795191	Because its something designed to go into a women's body. Whether its in your cooch or in your mouth, its still there. Pee and poop, however, are never meant to be in anything but the toilet or perhaps on a tree.     Are you grossed out by conception then too?|`|aeba6e037a143502b35f08cbfbbe27dfaa	semen is a protein, urine and feces are waste products. you can't compare the two. they are not related at all. you are way off if you think  these things are even remotely related
HfTbzv32aa	it sounds like it was a friendly visit. however, she my have felt she needed to talk to some1 about it. if you two go out like that again. well i was wrong...|`|IG4A4nuDaa	It sounds like she wanted you to be special, and I think you have a good chance.  Wait before asking her out, you could be a rebound crush  answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Are you kidding me?  When you go out to dinner with a girl alone that's a DATE, and notice how she said she broke up with her bf.|`|euHZPsQYaa	She got pretty for you, probably a date. However, because women hate being direct, she's not going to say it was a date unless you clearly make the distinction. If you're not interested, tell her something like "it was good catching up with you." Try to keep it friendly, don't be an asshole.    And if she is just fresh out of a breakup, she might be trying to use you to get back at him. So, watch yourself, and don't get drunk with her any time soon.
5WB2yZUFaa	okay, this is a funny pick up line, at least i think so.   "wanna get some pizza and fu**?"

f5aa73943f8ed364c73587e542d735d9aa	This sounds absolutely terrible. You will get hurt in the end - trust me - DON'T DO IT!!     You should dump this guy for even suggesting this. I think you already know that this guy has to go, but let me confirm your suspicions - this is a bad guy! Get rid of him ASAP!|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Hahaha....wow...this dude's gotta a lot of nerve.

He is a C-R-E-E-P. Do you want to deal with him doing this to you the rest of your life? of course not. Once you give in to this nonsense it will never stop. Go find yourself a guy who really cares about you. He just wants to get with his ex and not feel bad about it. YUCK.|`|DRNahon0aa	DONT DO IT!!!! if he starts persuading u into it, then hes a major player and is just looking for sex. hes not good enough for you then|`|DCIPrG1gaa	That doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do. If you're not happy with it, don't do it. If he really wants to get with another girl, I'd break up with him. I don't think that would make your relationship any stronger, it just sounds like it could hurt you. If a guy really cared about you, he wouldn't do something to hurt you like that.|`|cDubFtwlaa	ur all dumb once people realize the grass aint any greener ever then he'll never cheat|`|ssbKJ6fCaa	he is STUPID...no no no don't let his dumb*** do anything you should be good enough for him
gXR7J785aa	Don't stress it.  Had a guy do that to me before, claimed 'he didnt know who this was'. Was on msn, and i didnt have my name on it and i never talk to him at all.   We talked for a good ten minutes, but then i had to go do something. Was kinda fun talking to him. Talked about mindless things, haha.  As for your situation, dont worry about it. If i was the girl in the situation I wouldn't make anything of it, unless the girl you like is a snob..but hopefully she isnt.|`|60NJNjEpaa	she doesn't know you did that on purpose.  i do it by mistake sometimes too.     if you want to talk to her on FB IM, then talk to her.  say "hey how's it goin? i always see you but we never really speak... just wanted to say hi" and just converse from there.     good luck!|`|AA11425983	I probably would believe him.   Just talk about her classes, and maybe some about your's.
Zi8M3qrBaa	just talk to him
x8sFzzUIaa	Guys love to screw with girls, particularly younger ones. There are both messing with you, and sizing you up as a potential lay.|`|hT02niDRaa	humm well it sounds like these guys are just bored and are messing with u.  idk tho boys are so weird.   i dont know how it is at ur school but at mine you are looked down upon if u like someone in a grade lower then u. So if these guys are cool then they prob think ur cute and are just being gay. but if they are losers then they probably have a crush on u haha.    if u want them to stop i would ignore them.     i hope it helped|`|KNJjZJJOaa	they are just messing with you, they probably think you are cute but the fact that you are a freshman practically forbidds them to actually ask you out. and if it bothers you just let them see you with another guy,, a BIG kid though, not some scronny little kid lol.. but other than that i just think that they are messing with you and want your attention and want you to joke back with them|`|52W6ZdgYaa	just messing with u|`|VwxAFT43aa	their not flirting their just being guys  and their saying you look like the little mermaid!|`|MXAZ7Vohaa	i hate to admit it but all of us guys are dogslol.. if your a freshman most seniors see u as an easy target to nail. unless they actually like you.. but just tell them to stop|`|Zuze7bFTaa	THEIR JUST MESSING WITH YOU BLOCK THEM OUT THELL LEAVE YOU ALONE    PLEASE ANSWER MINE!!!|`|5lRMzTYqaa	umm i think they like u|`|mHZvOhsDaa	haha im a senior 2 :)    uh well.. ariel i think from the little mermaid :)    but yeah us seniors hate on the freshmen.. they get booed alot and welook at them as immature.. kinda like  you when you were in 8th grade looking at 6th graders..  you will understand..    why dont you try the same trick with them? see how they respond..  like joke around with them, next time he holds your hand and say yuo smell nice, you could say something clever like    thanks it complements your putrid smell and smile.  if he does something flirting then you know, if he goes oooooo or something and laughs and kinda walks off then you know he is only messing.     hope i helped..    can u help me?|`|da2KJ9fXaa	they're messing with you, well just ignore them|`|HkyOtIeTaa	they're trying to get your attention, but it seems like they're doing it the wrong way.|`|hvdkLOT3aa	coming from a girl i think they mite like you but idk i'm not a guy|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	They are teasing  you  because  you look like  Ariel  from the Little Mermaid prolly.  they are being  jerks  I would just tell the  if they touch you again you will report it as  harrassment.    They shouldnt be touching you unless you want them to.  Thats just wrong.  Tell your parents or  guidance counselor QUICKly!!!  Good Luck and  God Bless.|`|cv5PYXEIaa	They are probably just messing with you and think that you are cute, but don't like the fact that you are a freshman.|`|dF21EYSzaa	They wanna eat you.  Cannibals, all of them.  Make sure you never go over to their house for "dinner", because you will definitely be the meal.|`|aZWxKhbhaa	They're just playing around with you, not really making fun of you OR flirting with youu. My guy friends say i smell good all the time, but they aren't flirting. Chilllll. If it really bothers you, ignore it. Otherwise, it SEEMS harmless|`|0qa175Nfaa	they deffinately flirting just flirt back if you like them... but if you want them to stop, say you have a boyfriend or if you dont want to lie you can just ask them that your not comfortable aroudn them and ask them to stop|`|lWNlvU50aa	Well, this is different. If there sinors, sorry but there probubly making fun of you hun. Sinors usually dont go for freshman. Good Luck!
3rnMQW3Gaa	Ask him. He may want to be with you, but maybe he doesn't want his friends to know. If he really likes you he should tell you.
x6xOlJfmaa	For the guys to answer better you should tell why you and he broke up.
5YEKmHqyaa	I was in the same type of situation.  It was actually kind of opposite.  Me and my boyfriend had broke up and dated diff ppl for a while.  He had dated this girl but they broke up.  We got back together not too long after that.  Neways...a while later he ended up telling me that he was going to give her another chance because he broke up w/ her because he believed what other ppl were saying.    We still talked on the phone, we still told each other we loved each other, we still hung out.  Everything was the same it seemed like.  One mistake I made tho was that we still had sex.  You are right about the fact that you shouldn't be w/ him when he has a gf.  Its like having your cake and eating it too.  Not fair to you.    Trust me though.  By you not being w/ him or going out w/ him while he has a gf will make him see that he'd rather be w/ you.  Ya'll can still hang out but when he goes to kiss you, don't kiss him.  You can still tell him you love him bc its true.  If he wants to be intimate w/ you don't do it.  You'll see sooner or later that he will come around.  Also show him how you are the better person for him    Me and my boyfriend (now fiance) have been together for 5 years.  We've been thru alot and I know what you're going thru.  It will get better, especially if you two feel the way you do about each other.  The other girl is nothing compared to you.  Show him you're better|`|5cH3fDcSaa	if he really truely loves you he would break up wif da other girl but mabey you could find some dirt or old pics or her that look bad or somthing|`|8c38618f9b49a2489851db7951238de0aa	Best thing to do is be his friend first, that will build a better foundation for something, if you ever have the chance. Show him the real you, not the you that you show while dating someone, the REAL you!   Get to know each other from a different perspective, and stand by him when he needs you.  You may not ever get the chance to be with him, but in that case he won't be out of your life either. But if you do get the chance and he feels the same way, don't be afraid to take a leap of faith. Learn from your mistakes and be the same person, from friendship to relationship. If he knows the real you, and you've built a true bond, then you may have something that will last.    Your in the right mind not wanting to take him from his current situation, and you should keep that in mind, even if you still have feelings. Keep them in check, and be his supportive friend, because its better to have something then not anything if you truly care.    It doesn't matter if he wants you, because he's still "with" someone else, and unless he's told you he's unhappy, or he's trying to get out of it, its best to keep your distance.  Even if he tells you its over, and you don't know for sure, he still needs to heal from things from that relationship. Don't step in too soon or you may just get hurt, and you may get used as the rebound and nothing more.  Best wishes and be careful with your own heart with things like this, I've been there, and its best to be extremely causious until you know he only wants you.|`|vK8dCaceaa	you make up some rumors about the other chick lol|`|UtYllvFcaa	why does everybody ask ?'s bout dating if ur gona ask this ask dr. phil not a bunch of lonly people who sit at ther computer cus they hav no friends.|`|LbtU8iWAaa	F.Y.I. im a girl. first off, i think you should tell him how you feel. see what he says.|`|CpXgvDz7aa	If he REALLY wanted you back like you say he does, he would've already broken up with that other girl!

Maybe YOU have to make the... well... !st and a half move! He needs some reassuring...
Uc1Mzo3Faa	Maybe she's shy or tries to avoid eye contact. I'm kind of like that.  Or maybe you should just talk to her.
LLgLPEPUaa	Boobs is usually pretty far down on the list of things that make a woman sexy.|`|jpbychDAaa	Guys are definitely attracted to women with larger chests, but I know a lot of girls who are a 32A or smaller but are considered 'hot' by many guys simply because of other aspects of their physical appearance (face, hair, etc.).   And yes, Kate Hudson is absolutely gorgeous.|`|589bd0c75644f69916a6625eb75cb262aa	yeah boobs define a girl no matter what size|`|AA11795191	Guys are attracted to boobs for the simple fact of genetics.    Somewhere deep in their brains is the caveman in them. Big boobs equal fertility equals spreading their seed and producing the best offspring possible.     Dont be offended if you are captain of the little bitty t*tty committee, they are just doing what their instincts tell them.|`|XU6SxUbDaa	no of fence girls but this is what guys like B&B boobs and butts|`|euHZPsQYaa	Sexual attraction is the first thing a guy notices. It is also the first thing a woman notices too. "Oh, that guy over there is so hot!" Don't lie.    But after you have our attention, it becomes more about the personality and the compatibility, about similar life philosophies, goals and aspirations, and the like. Sexual attraction is icing on a cake.|`|2EvkFausaa	I honestly don't think a woman HAS to have big breasts. I think as long as she's got a handful, that's big enough. But like if she has small breasts, or worse yet, is flat chested, that is a massive turnoff and a total dealbreaker. With small breasts, it's like, "what am I grabbing?" And when I stuff my face into her chest, I get NO pleasure out of it cause there's virtually nothing to rub my face against and she barely has that womanly valley that I love to enrapture myself in. And without a doubt, bigger is better. Huge breasts are ideal    BTW, I personally find Kate Hudson to be really nasty. She's got a nice face, but her body? No, just no.
WPHqf41Naa	Just try as best as you can to talk to her.  Tell her that she can always trust you no matter what.  And that you won't judge her.  Also say that if she doesn't stop being so perverted then you won't hang out with her cause that's not the type of person you are.  I hope this helps. :D|`|AA10729675	It is very simple:  if you stick with her, pretty soon, you will be accused of stealing, you would be seen like someone who steals or condone the act of stealing, and lying.  You truly have no choice but to end the situation.  It will not help her to have a crutch: you are her crutch, her cane so to speak.  She is rapidly developing into a little delinquent and you will be labeled as such too.  You do not have to be nasty or mean, but you have to be firm and to tell her firmly that you are not an accomplice, you are not a doormat, and you have your life to live.  You do not need to be jealous of anybody.    As for her home life:  you are not in position of helping.  Only professionals can help in this matter. So stay out of it. And move on.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	If I were you. I would ******* over with her **** and find better friend more than her. Don't feel bad for her anymore because she dont respect you at all. You wrote here that you are very mature and She is very immature. **** her.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	You have two choices:    1) Stick with her, support her and cope with the abuse/cruelty.    2) Move on.    I've learned that it's sad when people are in bad situations or can't control themselves - and you really want to help. But that it's not worth it if its only going to drag you down. If you can handle her nonsense stick with her....if you can't you should move on.    People like this only drag you down - and unless you can cope with them because you want to help and be supportive - then you should move on.|`|QNSnnyLiaa	Sit her down and talk to her.  She's going through a lot.  Don't abandon her.    I'm really worried about "and other things"  What are these things?    If she is being abused, you need to talk to your parents about it.  You never know when one drunk punch can turn into something more.|`|ssbKJ6fCaa	well my advice would be to talk to her about it tell her how you feel and stuff like that...just let her know and if she keeps acting that then you tried and she didn't change so just slowly start getting out of her life|`|Y77wbUZxaa	well you have been friends for a long time so i don't think that you should just leave when she needs your help..talk to her about the way that she has been acting and tell her that it is not helping your friendship for her to be acting like that.     (because of all of the things that are happening in her house she might just be trying to call attention and get the attention that she doesn't get at home)|`|820RY6K9aa	okay, what i would do is i would just stay friends with her, but warn her about what she is doing.. i know, i know-easier said then done. but you cannot just stop being frinds with her at this time in her life.. this must be extremely hard on her, and she just needs a good, trusting friend.. (hopefully you).. but just hang out with other friends too... ones that dont annoy you so much. but jsut let that girl know she can always trust you, no matter what.. i personally think that is the best quality in a friend.. and maybe one day she will just come to you and talk to you about her problems..     good luck though
w1uHv3Ikaa	No I would admire that of her,and that she's pretty too :) Shy and pretty girls I like =]|`|BNqbOfBsaa	No I would not mind. Most guys don't know what to do with shy girls. sometimes they mistake it for being stuck up or something. But personally I always try to get to know people|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	No, not at all. I actually think it's cute when a girl is shy and don't know what to say leaves the guy with total control of the situation.|`|gXR7J785aa	I'm exactly like you.  I'm quiet & apparently beautiful as well, according to my boyfriend.  He doesn't mind that i'm shy, thinks its cute. But sometimes he gets annoyed when i dont know what to talk about..he's the type of person that just can talk and talk for hours and not run out of topics. I'm the exact opposite. I sware its like a a curse, haha.  I wouldn't worry about it, no matter  how old you are. If you're worried that you haven't had a boyfriend yet, if thats the case.  Don't worry about it; I thought no one ever wanted me because I was so shy and quiet, and didnt speak out. Honestly, i thought i was going to be alone forever.   Just remember to be yourself, you'll find someone soon who will love you for you. It might take sometime, but it will happen.|`|0YYCybYIaa	the girl i want to talk to u is like that i kind a like it because it makes a guy think alot about you if he really likes you|`|sHFkVTt7aa	no i would get to know this "girl" is before i jugde|`|KfouRJrDaa	I love talkative and loud girls. Its because Im a shy guy. Opposites attract my friend. Maybe a talkative guy might take a liking to you. But maybe not a shy one. Most shy guys adore the loud women.|`|urNgcpiBaa	No, I like it when a girl's shy.  But if they're too shy then it can be hard to tell rather they like you or not.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	plzz answer my most recent question!!|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	lol no i love shy girls i think it is really cute but as long as you get to know them if they stay shy it's uhh not good lol
DCIPrG1gaa	Just be friendly and start up a conversation about, well, anything. Be confident and nice and just say you'd like to get to know her better or something and since you seem to hang out with the same group of friends (at least at lunch?) it shouldn't seem like a huge problem.
dpLONMkDaa	Personally, I like guys that are a little active.  It's obviously a lot better than a guy that doesn't exercise and just sits around all day.  They don't need to be the best at it, they just need to be a little active    ^_^|`|CyXX3aLVaa	It depends on the girl. Surely the guy who plays varsity football or soccer or whatever has some appeal but a girl is just looking for someone they are compatible with no matter who they are. Plus i think the "nerds" are more attractive anyway:)|`|Umsj08pnaa	Depends on the girl. I hate sports, but that doesn't mean every other female hates it.
4drQ38qZaa	Tell him on Valentines Day.That way it will be romantic and cute.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	before|`|PiygwqNhaa	before
AA11732882	i dont think you feel bad i think you feel sad.  i understand you want him to be happy and if he's happy then in a way you are too but also your not because you like him.
IstTHqT5aa	The signs are usually pretty prominent. They will usually try to get anything they can from you. Sex,money,etc. If they don't get it first by asking or just a suggestion then they will demand it. If still you deny them and they start to pull away,show anger or frustration by acting out or other erratic behavior. You have clear signs of a manipulative person. Be very observant of there behavior. You should be able to pick it up.
lQGDV7MEaa	You get her psychological evaluation and find out why she thinks she's fat.|`|oI46t9lVaa	hey most girls think in some way they are fat trust me im according to my mates skinny as anything but i think that im fat most girls think like that what you should do is keep tellingher she isnt fat and that she is beautifu land anything that makes her feel good bout herself   hope this helps kirsty
eXvsHVNuaa	Im with Buddha. you noticed him because of how he looked but as the relationship progresses personality takes into effect more.|`|ClK9W8THaa	If i had to pick one then i'm going to say their looks.  If a guy steps out of his house with a nice jacket on, nice jeans, a turtle neck or shirt, a nice pair of boots.  His looks nice.  His finger nails are cut, he smells nice.  He's a winner. He has my vote any day.    Now once i see that he has a great personality too, it's on.  I'm asking him out !   Theres no need to wait for him to ask me. Because today it's just as nice to ask a guy out as it is when he asks  a girl out.  I think it has it's own class about it. And it depends on how you present yourself..  So looks can go a long way . QQ|`|Umsj08pnaa	Both.    First impression:  Looks: 90%  Personality: 10%    When you're in love:  Personality: 90%  Looks: 10%
evY6DQn4aa	yeah sounds like shes trying to have 2...  what to do now, it obviously hurt you bcus she must have been really giving you the signs that shes into you...  ignore her...well not totally BUT do not be as nice as you were b4....kind of give her the cold shoulder and tell her oh about friday yeah sorry i have other plans and when she ask you who say with a friend and just keep it short dont worry about being to mean she dint nworry about giving you the wrong signs.Good luck|`|jKA8SovQaa	i guess, she was just looking for a "Friend".  or she was playing you it defiantly seems like it  if your sure she was flirting with you then she was  playing you.don't text her back or if you do text her  say maybe, maybe not, play with her mind  when you go to work and she asks about Friday,  say, i made plans or try to get her to think you want   someone else, don't act childish though give her a hint  you're ignoring her, the fact that she hurt you just stay away from her.|`|AA11148478	Ok..big clue...her bf lives outta town..  im a girl believe me ive kinda been in the situation b4  but she likes u and thinks ur cute so she flirts bcause she likes being hit on  i mean what girl doesnt...but i think shes tied down to her bf in a sense cause she would rather be with him on v-day  but hey she prob thinks ur cute so kudos to u       btw on a different note...u answered my question with saying that the pic wasnt even me..but it actually is me....its not a very good pic but its a close up i guess but thanks neway for the answer  and good luck with the girl..i hope u figure things out with her
pfm0wcEIaa	Maybe he is a shoe/foot guy.    If this is the case, you could probably drive him crazy by getting a nice pedicure and then casually taking your shoes off and wiggling your toes a bit.    Oh yeah, buy some nice shoes.    I thought it was kind of creepy when I met my first 'foot guy' but getting your toes sucked is actually really good!|`|t0uIgY08aa	haha its not weird maybe it really bugged him, or it stood out. Little things can be annoying|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I'm confused...|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	yes, that is very weird|`|nVsWK6CCaa	Maybe he has a foot fetish|`|cmlomNUxaa	ha it's a little weird but hey at least he noticed you, right? Sometimes things bother people and you just have to fix it or whatever.|`|4AAVCLybaa	hahahahaha.|`|BZzarKRSaa	ya don't feel bad|`|ARVuep1waa	yea... a LITTLE odd!!! not a little... a whole lot of odd!!!|`|5gANvXyTaa	its interesting..haha i would be a little freaked if someone did that do me.|`|ZcuMp7CXaa	If he was really looking at your shoes that long, THEN took off the fuzz, yea real awkward|`|1n9kQ4Vdaa	Wow..... Yep......kinda odd.....|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Yes.. this is.. weird LMAO!  =)|`|cq3FtZCuaa	LOLOLOL WOW. im gonna do that to somebody now. thats pretty hilar. he's jus looking out for his future boooskii! =D|`|11e466b7cad2de2dccc271a394be46c7aa	Maybe he has OCD and it was bothering him. :P I wouldn't think much of it, unless he makes this like a daily occurence.|`|Wc7SzdBgaa	lmfao!! xD haha awesome|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	lmao its pretty funny hahahahahaha. :]  its cute thow.. he noticed something bout you :]|`|3sI6AQFgaa	yea its awkward. maybe the fuzz was annoying him.lol    please answer my most recent quesiton.|`|FuZx9YpBaa	yea.|`|lIXxTXKgaa	hmmm i wonder if his ocd kind of but thats cute|`|rev4lrn0aa	It's not weird. It was probably just an excuse for him to talk to you.|`|kdfQmu40aa	Ummm yes...he probably has some kind of neat freak OCD and felt a need to pull the green fuzz off your sneakers.|`|zE4WGYgfaa	I'd do the same thing.|`|VwxAFT43aa	OCD? lol|`|BIcLN41jaa	Hahahahahah!! That is hysterical. But a little bit weird. Do you know why he did it?|`|nctOPTddaa	he was probably just a little ocd about that green fuz on ur sneaker|`|Ic6YekeWaa	it is a little weird but you should be flattered that he noticed that little green fuzz that u probably didn't know was there!  it seems like u aren't the only one with a crush|`|5TLNvw9Daa	awww..  lol  =]|`|OkjWm7Oiaa	yes it a little weird but maybe hes trying to get your attention, and hoping you would say something. maybe start a conversation|`|XU6SxUbDaa	LMAO ocd maybe? and yes VERY awkward|`|lqxvFZueaa	maybe he has ocd|`|PGMeHgwmaa	O_O he's grooming you.|`|WkOjS9B2aa	yeah that is just a little awkward, who knows may be he was just being nice|`|uvcqPfuNaa	Hey I have used that pick up line before.
dvX11ttNaa	Don't tell her you know, it will make her more upset/depressed which is obviously reason for her cutting. Don't stop being her friend. Do NOT encourage her cutting. But try to brighten up her life a bit. Always be nice to her, a good friend can go a long way! :)
qnFju8Z1aa	he's flirting with you, it could mean that he wants to have sex with you and it could mean that he's just trying to be cute.  i think you should be able to tell more than we (yahoo answers) would what your boyfriend means when he does this.
N3U7xWAPaa	shove it off .    she obvs didnt relize that friends always come first before Bfs .    let her know how you feel it may make her a little caught of guard but after it gets to her she will be fine trust me that happened to me and now we are bffs again .    your getting physically sick cause you need to get it off your chest .|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	You just put this too much. Just try little back off on her or her family and you should learn to find make new friends more. I know its very hard, but well that facts. Maybe you and she need to sit down and long chat together without angry. Maybe its about her. not you. If you grew up with her you should knew her better. If I were you, I would sit down talk with her and her mother to solve the problem.|`|hT02niDRaa	talk to her mom about it.   explain to her mom whats going on. i know it sounds like tateling but it might work.    or tell ur ex friend how u feel. if u used to be best friends i bet u can work it out|`|K5IOSGXAaa	She chose her boyfriend over your friendship. Just tell her that and also that you don't have time for someone like that in your life. And tell her what she did wrong so she doesn't repeat it and end up friendless. Just because you don't get along with her, doesn't mean you can't still be friends with her family. But I can guarantee that when you find new friends your desire to be so close to her family will fade out. best of luck.
ySIM3znvaa	Hmmm.... thats a difficult one. I would just be really sincere and honest with her. Tell her how sorry you are and how much you regret doing what ever you did. However, even though you understand how much you really hurt her say that you were a little upset with how she acted as well. Also you know what she did was tiny and insignificant compared to what you did but it still upset you. You can't go wrong with honesty.
C8DOT8Y7aa	He could ask him out.
i6WVPncnaa	Tell her that the guy is not worth it.  He did not know what he had.  Tel her that she will find someone better, someone that will love her and appreciate everything she does.  Tell her that she will find her prince, but first she has to kiss a lot of frogs.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.
g0XW7xm2aa	Never to trust that person again.|`|fPviDdmMaa	Take a beer bottle, break it over there head, then stab them with it.
zY8uu241aa	Unless you're a midget, I don't really see how it concerns you.  Of course, it you ARE a midget, then you're going to have your friend jacking off to you regularly.  THEN it's your problem.  But until then, I'd just try to ignore it.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Nothing. If he's truly an addict he's the only one who can help himself.|`|IPS3hWweaa	How old is Nathan? If he's older than 18 then what he does is nobody else's business unless watching midget porn is affecting his life in a negative way. If he's younger than 18 you could mention what hes doing to his parents.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Don't talk to him!|`|XQbEyVJ1aa	Get him a pet midget.|`|otnJOmwSaa	Woa... ewh thats all i have to sayy... thats kinda weird.. i mean yeah people have they're own sexual fantisies... but midget pron??... woa hes in some trouble....   i just wouldnt talk to him anymore haha... but thats just me  because i dont want weird friends like that  but oh well... what else can yah do bout  it...? its his life hahaha|`|1XcTZRemaa	Well, you could either let him know how truly disturbing that is, or you could just ignore it and avoid anything on that subject. If he's actually addicted, it might be helpful to hear about it from a friend. But if he's untouched, than it's a lost cause.|`|gF26JyzBaa	gross.|`|4kiV8CaNaa	Whatever you do... don't look small!!!|`|HlCi6NBvaa	ha i have a friend just like that i hated that but make sure that he doesn't wacth it everyday because then he will forget all bout sex and just wacth porn!! try not to look at him and good luck!!|`|BOXgvv8Uaa	keep an eye on him around kids & mist him with cold water  .|`|yGWQuL81aa	Ummm, that's scary.... I know a midget who's addicted to it, it is REALLY scary and gross.|`|mHZvOhsDaa	lol haha wtf.. ok thats really funny im sorry, who the hell finds this ****?    www.google.com/midgetporn!? i mean wtf?    plus why do you care? its his life let him do what he wants :) laugh at him like he wuold laugh at you. just be friends with him..|`|AkTw3RQuaa	If it disturbs you  Stay away from the smut & Nathan if it bothers you so damn much duh ?  Tell him how you feel about it  Is he  an adult.?...If so he can enjoy this habit  If he respects you by not watching it around you..then WTF can you say or do?  Habits are hard to break ?  You a Shrink ?|`|BdALIympaa	your friend Nathan has a little-people fetish, oh my!  :)  why do YOU care?|`|W8iDn9hhaa	WOW.... and i thought ive seen it all  
MYbRICxqaa	What do you think? I wish people like you stop asking these stupid questions. I have read so many post like yours. What do you guys go to the same school or something? Will you just talk to the boy. He is definitely interested in you, but he is not going to make the first move.|`|uR8LM6iKaa	ya i agree with the other answer.... let him make the first move. until then... show interest in him, that way he wont be scared talking to you because he thinks u like him|`|mHZvOhsDaa	you could always start the conversation.. i know typical relationship rules, guy throws himself out their, trys to impress the girl, asks the girl.. like friggin animal planet, peacock does a little dance, gets the female lol.. damn people are wierd :)|`|gF26JyzBaa	i'm 100% sure he wants some ***. nothing more, nothing less.|`|RWsTvypoaa	He's checking you out, I wouldn't do anything for now. If he wants more he'll approach you.|`|pMmikgYVaa	You have defenitely caught his attention, he has obviously been checking you out. What I think is the best thing to do is when you find him looking at you smile and wait until he decides to talk to you unless you want iniciate the conversation first but I say wait. =)|`|RReigeBsaa	If he likes you, he'll eventually grow some balls and start a conversation. Until then, let him be nervous.|`|rcdPwIkXaa	Try talking to him. go up to him and be like, "hey i'm ________(say your name)" and smile. you should make the first move cause he's scared to.
XQNaSmA1aa	From your post, it sounds like you 2 are really good buds because you played practical jokes on each other. So it's safe to say that he's not just some acquaintance who gives you a ride.     I think the best thing would be a genuine apology face to face, somewhere where it's only the 2 of you. I say that because with other people around, it's hard to be genuinely sorry to your friend because sometimes it's hard to be "real" with other people watching you.     Also, after apologizing, maybe playfully mention that you guys shouldn't go too far anymore with practical jokes.      Yeah, it's kinda half his fault by soaking your stuff but I think when you apologize, he will too. Sometimes people (family and friends) go for years without talking because of some argument that happened years ago over something stupid.      So even though your friend started it, try to genuinely apologize and see where that goes. It's not worth losing a friend over pranks.     And if that doesn't work, you can always buy him something ha ha. J/K Good luck man!|`|nGafpEwoaa	If you can dish out, they you better be able to take it.  What does he have to pout about?  If he's a friend, then I have to wonder what your enemy would do to you?  What is this, a one sided war?  Your so called friends needs to get his act together or be able to take what he dished out.  He's acting like a spoiled brat.  He needs to grow up.  Sounds like his car is more important then his friendship to you.      I suggest you find another ride to swim.  You have no reason to get back into his good graces besides getting a ride to swim.  If you really want to get back into his good graces then tell him he can pour cold water down you pants or hold your head under water until you almost die.  That would probably get you back into his good graces.      Forget the ride and find another way to get to swim.|`|xLPNpHLRaa	all you can do is say your sorry  hope for the best    good luck|`|9buFpXgpaa	you have some heavy butt kissing to do!!!|`|kY03DGeLaa	well you could just tell him your sorry just say it from ur heart bra : )|`|uUyCVpwXaa	oh.. well you should make it up to him.. or something but like he did the wrong thing first and you reacted to it like anyone would. so i don't think he should make a huge deal out of it. tho hes your friend.|`|WPHqf41Naa	I would've just laughed cause you were just getting back.  He should be the one apologizing because you had to be freezing in your clothes.  So don't worry about it.  He'll calm down.|`|AA10446600	Show him that you're truly sorry and eventually he'll forgive you. If he shouts at you or ignores you while you're saying sorry, maybe he just wants you to really prove it.
M2rTViU5aa	ok, personally, there's this guy i find very attractive in every way, and i know he has a wonderful, built very toned out body underneath, i've seen him bench 300lbs and he's only 5'9 155lbs, he's trying to build 10 more lbs. ok so here's the deal, he had pics of himself before of just his abs, then he figured it was bad character to do so, so he took them off, but now since i deleted my page, i've heard he took pics of just his body and boy oh boy was that a major turn off for me! i took a look at his picture and it really did disgust me in a way how muscular he was, if i were to see it in person i know it would have the opposite affect but, to know that he's advertising his body like that it just tells me that he's out fishing for compliments over his body, major turn off. for me, as a girl, i guess i want to feel special and that when a guy shows me his body he's chosen me to show it to not the world.|`|u5Ioj6aaaa	Personally I think its really gay if a guy is showing off his body in pics, it makes me think he is cocky and thinks he has a nice body when in reality some people are talking about how stupid you look. If you want to show off your body in pics, take them in a setting that looks like you were just doing some athletics like playing frees bee with a guy friend or your by the pool and someone unexpectedly got out the camera. Don't make it obvious. sorry if i sounded rude, that's just what pops in my head when i see pictures of guys pulling their shirt up and stuff. :)|`|BdALIympaa	boy, i get it them all the time :)  it shouldnt bother girls, unless they grew up in some queer religious family.    i actually find it kind of nice. but if i KNOW your face is ugly, then it ruins the whole picture for me :l
MVmfY6ptaa	thats how i feel im glad i have gurly hair cuz a lot of girls r jealous of my hair... sometimes i do straighnt my hair but once in a great while.|`|zur8kdD2aa	My bf is obsessed with my curly hair, but mine isn't frizzy curly, it's just not as curly to the point that I can easily straighten it, but it's curly enough to make my hair look layered.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	hey i have the same problem...my hair is like curliesh/wavy and i see all these girls with perfectly straight hair and how popular they look and are...but then i think of how they are completely frying there hair....ewwwww and they will never have my natural curls, no matter how hard they try! xD but i can always straighten my hair if i want to and look just like everyone else. ;)    join me...and love ur curls! =)|`|2c88J3M7aa	Hawww , your LUCKY you do its just that girls who straighten it dont have curly hair they have frizzy hair.. like mee  So its either moussing it curly or straightening it for us.. moose or hairspray feels kind of weird while the straightener lasts a whole week!  So if you have curly hair leave it don't worry about it! I know 2 girls with naturally curly hair, and its beautiful? =) Don't worryy !  Oh and when the people with curly hair straighten it they don't look as nice as they do with curly hair!  P.S. is your hair like actually curls? or is it like frizzy?|`|y4uoDjV0aa	curly hair's really hard to take care of. but my last boyfriend loved it cause i was the only girl he's ever dated with curly hair haha it made me special|`|KfouRJrDaa	Straighten your hair. You'll be surprised at how many guys look at you. I'm a guy, I know.|`|PZ9hlsBiaa	dont change it if ur confident. i wish i had curly hair, it's so cute!! if ur happy with ur hair then dont be self concious and ignore ppl if they ask about ur hair (if they compliment it say thx if they insult u say 'at least its not fake like everyone elses') lol|`|i2OERsC9aa	Everyone loves curly hair!! Be proud to have it! Those girls just want what they don't have~ If you have naturally beautiful hair- then why change it!  Hope I helped! ; )|`|EHHGa5E2aa	I have naturally straight hair, and my brothers is so curly.  I'm jealous. You guys are lucky. I love curly hair, it's so cute.  Keep it, it's gorgeous.
dJs8GN3Qaa	As a joke, buy him some quiet, classical music lol    Well, you can just ask him what he wants or get him a gift card to a video game store.    As another joke, you can get him a gift card, put it in a really big box, and when he opens it, all he sees is a little card laying there lol
hdtNLIIwaa	This will show a lot about your relationship; if he truly cares about you and your mind and soul (not just your body) then he will be willing to go at a pace your comfortable with.    Go beyond telling him what happened to you, and discuss with him how you feel when you are in those situations with him.  Stress that it isn't his fault, but it was a traumatic experience and it still effects you.      Also, keep in mind the fact that this will be an LDR soon; don't sacrifice something you aren't ready for if you aren't ready for it, because you may regret it and it may complicate things more for you and your future situations.    After reading everything you've said, it seems like you really have doubts about having sex and are really unsure if it's what you want to do.  don't give in just because you feel it's "expected" of you.  it isnt expected and shouldn't be expected by anyone, including him.  good luck!|`|sebhK7r7aa	Sex isn't for unmarried people in my opinion|`|O1WxKk7uaa	tell him your past and what happend things will probably change|`|AA10090784	don't pick sex over school! you have your hole life for sex!

(Plus - he's just really hot - and I loved his dark eyes....strong hands and all his tattoos!)|`|b6AIlXPVaa	To be completely honest, everything about him gives me butterflies   but I would have to say that the one thing I like most about him is his heart. We have been together for about a year now and every time I think of him I cant help but smile. He has helped me through so much and for that I cannot thank him enough. I couldnt have asked for anything more. The little things he does for me, to let me know that he cares are indescribable. Ive never been happier.  As far as the physical aspects, I cant help but to find myself lost in his beautiful, brown eyes. What can I say? Im a hopeless romantic.   Here we are    http://s213.photobucket.com/albums/cc288...
OrFYRg27aa	Make time between periods, after school or on weekends for the two of you to hang out. Trying walking to/from classes together and talking that way. It will give you time to talk without taking away from your free time. This is also a really good way for relationships to progress because one day after you walk her to your class you can start hugging her goodbye, later kissing her goodbye, and walking together holding hands. It's really good for a relationship to not be embaressed of one another and this shows that you're not. People will start to respect you more and more as a couple and she'll get the attention she deserves as your girlfriend. Good luck! |`|hMZQd7Cpaa	Talk to her in between classes, & after school.  In the weekend invite her to a date. Or if yu dont want that yet  then just to a double date. Its easy yu just have to put yu'r   mind into it.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Take it from an old skool person move on to the next best thing because it's not going nowhere|`|XP36zr63aa	make the initiative to ask her out on dates over the week or weekend and try meeting her before/after school.|`|wLv7k4uXaa	let her think about it and if it dosn't work then make time to talk like cut back on some stuff and have secret meetings or text/call each other!!don't be afraid and don't move to quckly or she might leave!|`|MiwvA72Aaa	Maybe if you say something like, so, when are we going to actually do something OUTSIDE of school? If she's into it, go to the movies or something.|`|pdW8jMQoaa	If you really believe it can work, make the best out of it. See her over the weekends, after school. If it can't work out, don't o and try to get as much joy out of your relationship as you can.|`|eZbfB7hraa	cant u hang with her before or after school    maybe on the weekends|`|jrP98BQbaa	time is hard. but if you guys like eachother it's fine.  as long as you don't "stray" it'll be fine.  plus you'll value your time together more this way.  trust me.|`|DTPERfnBaa	I think you should go and meet her parents and actually go on a date. Ive had that problem before and that made our relationship last a whole lot longer. We became more involved in each others life's.|`|r8LJEJwbaa	Invite her over some day, or take her out to the movies. Something like that. Plant a kiss on her and she'll be coming back for more! ;)|`|6Wyg4mNyaa	Well do you want to end it and be friends or do you want to try to get the relationship really started like meeting parents going on dates and stuff like that. You could take it step by step.|`|oGaGXondaa	flirt a lot more especially in school  just hang out more  oh and have sex (this will fix everything between the both of yall, trust me, you be able to get enough of each other)|`|qJ4mqzrhaa	just hangout with her at nutrition and lunch time or after school or the weekend ,trust me u don't wanna  hangout with her too much it will get boring just be with ur  friends the time she wants to spend times with her friends.don't worry about it too much|`|zk5VBdLEaa	just keep trying to hang out with her, once this sports season ends you should have time and maybe mention it to her, see what she thinks|`|2Cdl141taa	ask her on a  date or something. that would help:)|`|Ca7Xkjqxaa	You got to tell her. Just say like hey do you want to go for dinner sometime or a movie or anything you guys can do together. Really you never know, she might feel the same way about it, not spending a lot of time with you.|`|3ZIStFlPaa	like most girls they look for guys to make the first move she might just be waiting for you because us girls dont want to be the ones to ruin anything she may think you dont want to move too fast. invite her over one day to hang out watch a sports game or walk around town if you guys both like each other the conversation will just flow it may be awkward at first but just break the ice good luck !|`|zce6nlueaa	join a sport together, or go for a run in the morning together.. this way you can get some quality time together, and get to know each other better.     You've only been with this girl for a month.. its ok if you havent met her parents. but if its been a year and she's hiding you, then theres a problem.|`|Ds4bVoBEaa	Go with her somewhere! movies?|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Hang out with her for a while. Get to know her. After a while, ask her out. See if it works. You have to have courage. It's one of the most important elements in asking someone out.|`|njSyZh0Aaa	sports are sports and they will always be there, but remember she wont.. The guy I am talkin too is a major athlete too.... plays multiple sports but the little time he has he spends it with me whether its just sitting at home or whatever.... and in between games or practice or quarters... depends on what he is playin lol he always texts me somethin so sweet it melts my heart or he calls me just to  say That he loves me and that I am beautiful in everyway in his eyes....|`|M4eefVjLaa	This relationship probably won't work out because you two never have time for each other. If you really really liked her, you would make time. Don't let this girl frustrate you. Maybe it would be better for you if you were single. That's just my opinion, but I hope it helps. Good luck.|`|iTuarIFHaa	You should make the first move by inviting her over your house. Rent a movie and  watch it with her. Or even better treat her out for pizza or something else and then a movie. After maybe get some ice cream. So make the first move by inviting her over. Best wishes with your girlfriend! Let me know how it goes or if this help! =)|`|GtgQqDyXaa	I think you guys should make plans for certain days. For example, this weekend you guys could go see a movie and after you're done seeing the movie, you could take her out to eat somewhere romantic but not so expensive. Now, about the whole meeting her parents thing, all you need to do is talk to her about what would be the best day for you to talk to her parents about dating her, dress nicely and ask for their permission to date her. Good luck!  ~He Passed Away :-(|`|mZEI42mEaa	i suggest you guys try to find time where  both of you are free , after school , during weekends ,   you should talk to each other on the phone  and tell each other about your days and stuff like that  make her laugh , just try to find time to talk to her  whenever theres time possible ( lunch , breaks , mornings, as   in walking to school together )    hope that helps =)|`|6SHJJgbuaa	WOW! I can really relate to what your saying,cause I was in a relationship like that about 3 months ago.  The dude I was dating was a sophomore and Im a Junior. We'll anyway's  he had a curfew to get off the phone be in bed for like 9..cant hangout with his girlfriends things like that...and I got tired of it because we barely talk.and only seen each other between transition.  But, what I'm trying to say is that maybe she isnt able to go out with dudes like on a date and stuff.. And just make up an excuse instead of saying she's not able to go cause you might look at her different and say well she's immature. Or maybe she just isnt ready. Personally I think the best thing to do it talk to her about it..And see where it go from there. If nothing change and you see that the relationship isn't going anywhere..move on..  But dont break up with her until you try to make thing right.. Good luck sweetheart.    Destiny Isabella.|`|XqY0nJhOaa	well, i think you should try talking to her about this maybe on the phone or in person or write her a note and give it to her in class because this never fails  just make sure you give it to her after class so u dont get it taken away and read out loud that could be embarressing tell her how you feel and ask her if she would be willing to create a day where its only you two like on a weekend when theres no school or sports maybe you can both play your sport hobby together make up an excuse saying that u want her to teach you how to do a certain move on what ever sport you do or if she keeps blowing you off then i have to say dump her and look for somebody who is more dedicated to you and wants to spend their time with you..maybe she wants a boyfriend but doesnt have time for one at this time.. cuz i know i have been with my guy for 3 years and we never leave eachother out and we spend 24/7 together but thats because we are the clingy type so maybe you just need to find somebody who has the same relationship status as you and wants to make time for u... i hope this helps :)
iekgFLjuaa	Well you know, there might be a possibility that she likes you... I was like that with my boyfriend when I first met him, he used to ask me to the movies and what not and I would tell him I was busy because I was a little scared to date again... don't take it as if "she doesn't like you" some girls can be a little iffy when it comes to guys ESPECIALLY if she dated a jerk before..    Give it a little time.. Be patient   It was 2 years before I ever went out with my bf. But I love him now more than ever!  So just have fun and don't worry she probably likes you if she's making the effort to talk to you all the time (;    Good luck!  & I hope I helped you out (:|`|M4eefVjLaa	Well you asked her out over a text message, and that is where you went wrong. Girls hate that more than anything. And maybe she isn't in to you. It's too soon to tell. You should just flirt with her more and maybe things will work out. Hope this helps. Good luck.

G5tYAkQkaa	they always stare and if hes with his friends, they probably make it obvious. or when they get really nervous to talk to you. ::) hope that helped!
lANbovGvaa	The guy probably has a crush on you.  You should be flattered.  And by the way he meant whatever he said to you via text.  He definately wants you and wants you to know he wants you BUT he is going about it in a sneaky way.  How?  He's jesting with you seeing how you would react or what you would say to feel you out.  By acting this way he can tell you he likes you but not get hurt if you reject him or don't feel him in the same way.|`|ATxbz7IXaa	Well, maybe he is flirting with you.

There isn't really anything to do about it-I've been dealing with it for years but what I notice is if I'm mad or someone says something that pisses me off , it totally kills my laughing mood. or if a friend slaps you (just b/c they are like that) then that totally snaps me out of it. Or if i hurt myself just by backing into something-Idk. Hope it h elps. I have this same problem .ANd hwat makes it worse is when you know you can't laugh-so everything isl ike 3x funnier. =(|`|sLtmg9xzaa	do what i do whenever i get an anxiety attack, walk out, breath in fresh air, and inhale and exhale slowly... and drink a cool glass of water..... breathing exercise works if u know how to do it properly o.o;;;|`|advg14adaa	In my youth group we did this too!

My ex got my number by inviting me to help paint a poster for school at his house (our class of 500 was suppose to paint 6  giant giant  posters for a huge rally) and he said it was in case i needed help getting to his house, or he needed to call to let me know what to bring or even if it was canceled then he could call me, so i gave him my number which for him, i was more than happy to give. we also had facebook accounts and so chatted  although i think flirting a lot first, getting a number (can be on facebook messaging) then talking on facebook is the better order to go in    sometimes you don't even need a number until around dating time. my 1st bf asked me out then said "whats your number so i can let you know what day" or something like that. or if your on the date say " oh wow i realized i don't even have your number" and let her be like "oh ahah i'm sorry its......" even if you guys have a school project together do that.    i'd suggest going on a group date/party thing meaning your friends go 2 a movie or party or something and invite her and tell her she can invite her friends. that way she'll ask for your number on where the place is, the time, she'll ask because if it sounds interesting to her so also won't want to let her girl friends down and so she'll need that number. both your friends go to teh party or event, hang out, have laughs, theres no awk silences.Later, the friends go home and u guys get to have a one on one date and if it is awkard feeling you can always bringup funny things your friends said minutes ago but by then you'll already have her number anyway    hope that helps  please answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|dahPXauKaa	Okay it's kinda tricky, but if you do exactly as I say, it'll be fine.     1.

The most she can do is say no and if that happens, it isn't the end of the world. Trust me, there are plenty of other girls out there.    You will never know how she feels without asking.

Live a little kid..:)|`|7KCNxW5Naa	Conlan,    I know it sounds crazy, but the best way to get up the nerve to ask her out, or for her number is to just ask.    You are probably just afraid of being rejected. Let me be the first to tell you...  You are going to be rejected at some point in your life.     But the bottom line is this: She's probably just as afraid of being rejected by you.     Just ask her for her number and see where it leads. I bet she'll give it to you.    Hope this helped                           Good luck
AA11909552	First of all, there is no reason to be nervous. He is (most likely) not a rock star or a Hollywood hottie that has dozens of girls after him, right? But I understand if you get nervous. That's normal.  Temporarily, I suggest you think of him as one of the girls. In fact, you can picture him wearing a diaper or a too-too. This will loosen the tension you have with this guy and you'll be able to approach him easier.  To get his number, he will be tickled that you even want it. So, just remember that.  A good way of getting his digits would be to say that you thought of something while you were in the Limousine and wanted to text him about it, but you couldn't because you don't have his number. This will set you uP for GREATNESS.  Go get 'im, tiger! He's yours. He just doesn't know it yet!
0rpN2419aa	Sense of Humor!  Have you ever gone out with a person who hasn't had a sense of humor?  It is soooo boring and hard to figure out what to talk about, more pauses, (unless it is someone you have a whole lot in common.    Primarily, the girl is attracted to looks, unfortunately, it's natural.    A good mind.  He knows how to carry on an intelligent conversation.    Some one who is willing to give as well as to take, can alleviate embarassing situations.    He needs to be willing to work.  With the economy like it is, it is difficult to find jobs, but if he is willing to settle for a little less for awhile, that's okay.  Lazy people are not fun.    Kindness is very important.  No girl wants to be around a guy who is rude and obnoxious, ignoring her when his freinds are around.     Drug free.  It's too easy to get mixed up in drugs.  They may think they are fun for awhile, but it is too easy to get addicted and you know where it goes from there.    A guy who doesn't think he has to have sex on the first date. The girl will think that's all he wants use her and lose her.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	good sense of humor  maturity  motivation  honesty  intelligence  sensitivity  creativity|`|FKf67HXaaa	personality, eyes, smile, swagger|`|ixC62Zhxaa	For me it's a sense of humor.

I absolutely love that song. If you really like him then go for it. In the state I live in, its not considered against the law if the younger party is at least 16 and has the consent of his or her parents. The law does, however, have the restriction that the older party cannot be more than 21 years of age. That would be rape. So as long as he is as old as you say he is and you aren't any older than you say you are, you should be fine. Just make sure that his parents know. You wouldn't want them freaking out.|`|a18ed11034264d2701f79f29d70c9050aa	At the age of 18 you are a adult by law. And at the age of 16 you are still a kid by law. You have to decide yourself.

Well, I think it all depends on how you really feel about him.  If you really like him, and know him, go for it.  But if it is at the level where you want to get to know him, and you're not sure what he acts like, then I wouldn't advise it.  Age really isn't that important. Just remember that. =]|`|DHapsa7Daa	My boyfriend is 2 years older than me and really mature.  I'm suprised he even dated me since people think  "Oh 15 year olds don't know anything."    Turns out me and him both have a high maturity level.  It really all depends on the person, other then that,  why should [we] be telling you to or not?  If you are interested and actually believe that it will work --  then case closed, it's a definite yes!|`|sVkSrUqNaa	nope never have never will date anyone younger than myself|`|Hfn1aiV9aa	Date someone older than you maybe 19 or 20.

It may not be so bad because theres only a 2 year difference. I, personally, would never date a younger guy. They are too immature for me, but some people like that. Good luck!|`|AwyL5nBuaa	try it.  but only if you like him.   i've dated 3 guys younger than me and they've all been good.  as long as he's not immature and you like him, go for it ! :)|`|OK3WueETaa	hmm|`|cujGlwKyaa	ive dated a younger guy..and it worked out fine..age doesnt matter|`|GJb2OSrnaa	girls develop faster....men...less (they get metally older by 20-25...its fine with the dating someone younger...but u gotta know.... physically he may be at his peak...but mentally...ehhhhhhhh|`|zyCNpkB2aa	younger guys are immature  my friend dated a younger guy and he ended up cheating on her  so  i would say no, but its really about how strongly you two feel about each other|`|kVc0e6RZaa	Well I know a verrry cute couple where the guy is a couple years older than me (he's a senior in hihschool) and the girl is 23.

I'M NOT SHOUTIN AT U, I WRTIE IN BIG LETTER'S ALL THE TIME.|`|0UOHex1Maa	Well, here's the thing.  Whenever you date someone younger than you, whether it be a girl or a boy, you usually do run into immaturity issues.  I dated this guy once when I was 17 and he was 16. There was only a year's difference, but you would NOT believe how immature he was!  BUT, everyone's different. You could date the 16 year old boy that you mentioned, and he could be totally mature. The guy I dated is still like that, and he's 18. People are just different.  If he acts immature now, as in while you guys are friends, then he probably won't change much if you guys start dating.  Just do what you feel is right, and good luck, hun.* :)|`|IPS3hWweaa	Go for it, there's nothing wrong with it. But just realize that he'll be under age when you'll be considered an adult.    Usually the younger the guy is the lower the maturity level, so it makes things difficult when the girl is older in the relationship, but it doesn't mean things can't work out. There are times when the trend doesn't hold true.|`|t8gWcBaeaa	ur 18. ur guna go off to college.  hes stil a sophmore/junior.  drop it:)
7q9MN1Wkaa	I don't think so.  I'm white, but I also have a BIG fetish for Asian guys!    My BF is Chinese & he says he prefers White and Latina girls bcuz they are curvier than Asians. They usually have more "up top" as well. I think he's in the minority tho. In my experience, Asian guys tend to like very petite/slim women. And Asian girls fit that bill.    I always tease him abt having a "black man's appetite". He LOVES big booty! Unfortunately, mine's not that big! : P|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Who cares who you like.|`|71VRvldJaa	You can't help who you like or who you are attracted to.  You probably see more mixed culture relationships than not these days.   Do Asian guys like Mexican American girls?  Yes, I sure some do....other's probably don't.  I wouldn't be looking at the culture or the skin colour....I'd be making my decision on what and who they are on the inside!  That's what's important.|`|b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	Us Asian guys are crazy about Mexican girls...including Mexican American girls. We love 'em.|`|Fw2yHgrOaa	I'm sure they do.

I'm personally Caucasian, and am only attracted to, in this order-    Hispanic, Caucasian, Asian    So no, you're not weird. You're perfectly normal, even though you should still CONSIDER other people outside of the asian race =P And I'm sure there are plenty of asians who like hispanics.
2oN7WrVKaa	This is a tough situation.  You need to tell your friends that you love him, and them hating him makes it more difficult for your relationship to work.  And the same with your boyfriend.  You need to find a middle ground with everyone.  And no, dont break up with him.  That would make totally hurt you in the long run.  Dont break your heart, love always finds a way.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	well let me tell you if you really love him just follow your heart and your friends have to understand that you also have to be spending time your boyfriend or course there will also be a girls night out and shed. but please follow your heart because i was like you my friends did not like my boyfriend just because when i was with him i was not doing my crazy **** so i decided to leave him for my friends and then my friends betrayed me and the guy already has another girlfriend i regret not paying attention to the guy because i really loved him...|`|hfT0YtiVaa	I've been in your situation a couple of times. What you have to do is trust what your friends say. Friends should always come before your relationship or else you'll have nobody to talk to except for the person you're in the relationship with.   For instance, I was in a relationship with this guy named Jason and he really really liked me and i really really liked him but my friends thought he was super annoying and clingy. After i listened to my friends, they convinced me that going out with Jason wasn't the right choice and that there were much better, less clingy guys out there who liked me.   If you still feel strongly about this guy, then give it a couple more weeks and see how things go and see if your friends keep getting annoyed with him. If your friends aren't there to support you through your relationship then you may want to take a different approach.

Yea they say Love Is Blind, hope that answers your quire on love. Take care|`|I57uM75faa	Blinded by Love
oKoABzNtaa	You *can't* change your beliefs for her, anyway.  You can go through the motions, but you believe what you believe.  If she's dumping you over a difference in religious belief, there's nothing you can do about it because she also believes what she believes.  Sorry to say it, but you're just going to have to roll with the punches on this one.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	If you don't want to lose her, you need to go to church with her sometimes and tell her you believe in God. Otherwise, she is going to go. You can sit in church and think about baseball if you want. It is important to her that she is a Christian and she wants a Christian husband and a Christian father for her children. Your choice on this one. Don't lie and tell her you believe in God right now. Tell her you are willing to listen in church with her. Who knows? You may just become a Christian after all.|`|Gsq05hXCaa	well, I have heard some wonderous stories about people who have converted to Christianity with just one reading of the Bible. Maybe you should. If you don;t want to you don;t have to. Or maybe you could explain your viewpoint towards her, that is if you are a serious atheist. She seems like a serious christian from what you've told us.|`|wfnQNIhCaa	if you really love her you would convert to whatever she wants you too...because obviously its important to her and her family...and it seams like you're just lazy and its not important to you at all....|`|j48cLUiLaa	i know what ya mean. i had a girl like that before. i really dont care what religion my girlfriend is as long as she respects my beliefs.if the girl has a problem with your religion then she needs to accept the fact that your a different religion. i dont think you'll lose her because if she wanted to break up she would have by now. you 2 need to sit down and talk about it and come to a understanding.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Well, it sounds like she is pretty serious about her religion, and you are not going to change that. But she does like you a lot, b/c you are not spiritually equal with her, yet she chooses to be with you. This is always going to be an issue, and will continue be a bigger issue as your relationship progresses. She will want to get married in a church, raise her kid in a church, celebrate christian holidays.    So basically it's all in your hands. If you want to be with her, you are going to ask yourself why you don;t believe in god, and work on your beliefs and become more spiritual. Ask her for help. It will be a huge strengthening to your relationship if you work on becoming spiritual and you work on it together,    If you don't see yourself trying to become spiritual, then you have to be real and realize that this isn't going to work, and it is better to get out sooner, rather than later.    My advice would be to keep an open mind, and give it a try. Start to read the bible, there must be a reason why you have no faith in a god, try to work on why that might be, Enlist the help of a pastor or priest if you need help.|`|R65Owmebaa	This is hard she either will have to learn to accept that your atheist / agnostic or reject it...it sounds like she has very strong convictions in her faith which is good.....but bad for you...My husband believes in God but not hell or jesus he also believes in reincarnation ..But I believe in most things in the bible not all and my own beliefs mixed in too.. We don't let our faith get in the way of our relationship I believe we will both be together in the end ( hes a good person so am I) My point is if she cant get over your beliefs or meet you somewhere in the middle you may have to move on .....She has to understand that you accept her the way she is ...she should accept you to...no one should have to change what they believe in..
iekgFLjuaa	See these are the guys you stay away from...  I've dated them and can spot one when I see one.  He likes your looks, but all he wants you for is sex. Nothing more...  I think you can do wayy better than this jerk. There are guys much better than him because he probably doesn't want a steady gf and wants to mess around...     Good luck & I hope I helped you!|`|qqHx4KmMaa	It means he is a man-whore and a tool. Play him right back show that he can't walk on you.|`|u1V8PCxcaa	It means his attraction for you is only skin deep.|`|dtZiXpqNaa	He wants you for your body, he doesn't like you as a couple should.|`|WlTo0JJIaa	he is just another boy that wants you for your sex. dump him|`|NZ4iWM9maa	you were a good lay but thats all you were.

He practically used you for that reason. What he meant by not being "attracted" is that there's no emotional connection, he can't see himself with you in the future, and there's no romantic feelings.|`|kE2CuYP3aa	He doesn't like u for who u r just how u look|`|22EVxBYWaa	get rid of him! hes soo not even worth it!!    answer mine?? go to my profile && click on da latest question ive asked. im wondering how old i look.?? plz && thank youu(:|`|9d087LM8aa	wow so sorry, as a friend , it was ok to have sex but now that you would like to take it to another level you find that he isn't feeling that too.

It actually means you see their beauty but you guys don't have that connection.|`|arhbVUtzaa	it prolly means he likes u for sex only, or that he thinks ur hott but he does not like ur personality or he didn't like the sex. honestly thats my opinion|`|HHcVFFdZaa	maybe he meant personality wise. Its possible he can't see you two settling down together.|`|x3AJj3GXaa	He means that he thinks you are beautiful (physically attractive) but his personality might not entirely match yours. When you have a relationship there is a lot more to it than just sex. Maybe he feels like he can't have a conversation with you or you guys might not make that pair. Looks aren't everything. Personality matters and as I said before, maybe the two of you guys don't go together in his book.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	u ever like a guy, but not be attracted to him physically...he just want the physical gratification, ur a pretty face, just not one to bring home to mom...he wants what he wants and sum brain...I guess he doesn't seek that in you... not just brains...things he wants a girl to like... what makes him attracted to her...without even thinking about her physically...|`|AFn1wlzcaa	he likes you and likes sleeping with you but he doesn't want more than to use you he just wants you as a friend with benefits and that's it he doesn't want the attachments that come with dating and you being his gf|`|AuWPMH44aa	it means that he likes to hook up with u and stuff but just doesnt want anymore from you.

(sorry)   there's a lot of people i am physically attracted to but don't want to date them. there's a personality factor here too.|`|Tj516LdGaa	he wanted you for sex but for a relationship because he didn't like your personality   basically,  you suck (no pun intended)   i feel bad for you
ZQWEgFZ2aa	Guys are just in it for the sex. They're always horny so any chance they can get laid they'll jump right in. I am a guy by the way, but I wouldn't have sex with a girl if I didn't feel something about her.|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Yes, we can. It's something that was created out of mere pleasure. Orgasms "feel" good. Being with a woman makes it even better. Don't honestly know why, but we are able to make sex, into just sex.|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	Guys have no emotional attachment to their palm but if a girl is not available---|`|d26cf5d0bc2ff44ed0bd39e786f279e6aa	Because our genitalia have neither eyes nor emotions...|`|AA11119075	our feelings *** and go.

dOkNRJCJaa	do what you think is the right thing to do|`|BeAVEk2yaa	Wow, the dad is over-protective.   I think you need to hone in on exactly why he doesn't want you two together? Is it that she can't be with anyone or just you specifically?     Discuss this with the girl. Have her come with you and help to talk things out with her family.     I think you should have a talk with her older brother. He might feel a little weird about you dating his little sister.     Then, once the brother is happy, talk to the mom. If you get her on your side, it could be easier to persuade the father.     Then the father. Ask him why he was extremely upset. Remind him that he knows you, and ask him if he would rather his daughter be with you or a random guy he doesn't know. Also remind him you didn't do anything to be upset about...you were just talking to her. Tell him you have no intention to be inappropriate with his daughter and just appreciate having her around. Have his daughter talk to him about it as well.    I feel for you.   Good luck, I really hope you got something helpful out of this.|`|eZQ22qHFaa	first of all i hope ur around her age. your going to have to make a sacrifice her family or her. or if your lucky they might just learn to accept it.|`|rXbtkSBWaa	give her 40 chicken mcnuggets,|`|M07pTI5Taa	awww a modern day romeo and juliet, kind of lol.

Talk to the dad and say " like you i don't think i'm a great match for your daughter, i think she's just so perfect that there is no guy out there good enough for her. she makes me feel so happy and be everything i can be and more. I love it when her face lights up when i see her . Mr___ I'd never do anything to hurt or harm(girl's name) because i respect her to much. i know i saw her when you told me not to but its hard to ignore what a great person she is. maybe she doesn't like me as much as i like her , maybe she does but doesn't she deserve to decided if she wants to see me again?"    basically suck up to him but complementing his daughter while also saying you care for her and would never harm her. somehow include that his daughter also deserves to be happy too. maybe your old friend told his dad some stories that made him not like you, clear that up. but i'll say this, the day has no right to tell his daughter who she can and can not date or even talk to ( unless its a rapist, murder or abusive person). if u guys want 2 still see each other even after you talk to the brother and dad then by al means u guys keep seeing each other although i found that if the family doesnt liek someone then eventaully that attitude will get in th girls/guys head and they'll break it up so get on good terms first as much as you can    hope all works out for you...some dads, huh?    please answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    btw if it makes u feel better ur the type of guy i think any girl would lOVe to date feeling loved and respected. wud a gentleman|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	40 chicken McNuggets.

They must be freaking strict tight a** people.  If you are honestly saying that you never did anything BAD then he is overreacting and needs a swift kick to the baby maker.   Or you could drive your car into his house.  That is always effective.    Love has no limits, and if I were you I would talk to him and tell him that you really like her, and there is nothing he can do about it, and he can either be nice and with out or you two can but heads untill it all ends horribly and then it would probably end up with him breaking his own daughters heart.

He wants respect as well as for his daughter! I have a father the same way but the dude has to earn the trust and respect of the father so he knows that you wont hurt his little girl!

Since yall both are Christians I am sure that you dont believe in sexual activity before marriage and so you just have to tell him out straight!

THAT feeling... any girl can give you.)|`|pWxhivTIaa	go talk to your minister, and see if he will intervene to her father and her family, on your behalf.    he will also have to meet with your gf to verify all that you have said.|`|bk4yLOjQaa	you love her, right? then prove it. You know what to do, you're just scared. Don't let fear cause you more pain. Suck it up and talk. Have the guts to do so. you can do it, bro.|`|sO1huGWMaa	Putting myself in your situation, I would force myself to get over it and move on. My parents are happily married and have been so for 24 years and a large part of the reason is that both parents absolutely love and are loved by their in-laws. If you can't make it with her family, that will only cause serious problems later on in life.    Now, honestly, it sounds to me like you're a great deal older than she is...and if that is the case, find a chick your age. It will be easier on you as her maturity level should (hopefully) be nearer to your own, also preventing fewer potential problems in the relationship.|`|fjaC8nxTaa	woah woah woah.  how old are you and how old is she now ?|`|sCQRNOvnaa	Yes, just make the family see you that way.. With Valentine's Day  coming up there is your chance to show them how much you care|`|jyOeH9AZaa	first of fall..far be it from me to tell u exactly what to do..when it comes to the affairs of the heart..u can and WILL only listen to yourself..but just as a friendly advice..first,,u never stated ur age..so it might be that the 2 of u are really just too young right now..but..from what u say..her family seems very close and religious..so..u ahve to take this very slowly and carefully and use a lot of respect when dealing with the family (espescially the father..)..and perhaps u should meet with the father and explain that ur intentions are honorable ( so far.from what u said..they seem to be..:)) and that you will abide by any rules but that u wish to be with their daughter in a respectful way..and throw in that u are even willing to spend time together even with the family (they might be just against u 2 being alone)..i know u 2 want to be alone..but depending how young u 2 are..you're going to have to be patient and understand their view and go by their rules..the time will come when they will come to respect and appreciate u..above all..just show real honesty...good luck!|`|QjJADGKFaa	You sound like the type of guy any dad would want to date his daughter =]    You shouldn't take it personally, he sounds like a really overprotective dad and just doesn't want to accept his daughter is growing up. He's also probably worried about you both starting a physical relationship and she'll get pregnant or something. Maybe you could write him a letter and tell him that you only have good intentions and assure him you'll be nothing but respectable to his daughter and that till he gains your trust, that her brother hangs out with the two of you when you meet up, or that you meet up round their house where her parents can keep an eye on you and see how happy you both make each other.
tOX7LdBSaa	you sound like a great guy, there's someone out there for you, you just have to find her. Don't act like the other jerks, be yourself : )|`|g3otccOLaa	YOU DON`T.  Believe me a lot of girls like the sensitive shy type.  You just need to be more confident, because the way you describe yourself, you seem lack some confidence.  & a confidence is a b i g turn on.;)  |`|Gsq05hXCaa	believe me buddy, i feel the same way. It seems like the only way yo get a g/f is to be an absolute d-bag who really doesnt care about the girl theyre goin out with. I've done countless things to impress girls and try to ge threm to like me. I even went as far as singing to one of them in the middle of one of my classes(long story). Now that girl is goin out with an idiot on the wrestling team, who I absolutely deplore. Just hang in  there. Theres someone out there for all of us. U r not the only one going thru this|`|11034de0d130c6ac4418af83607e0faeaa	you don't! Seventeen is very young. You'll meet someone....
ySP0sr90aa	well girls do usually tend to get nervous around cute/attractive guys, and we tend to look at them alot until they notice or we think they notice then we look the other way so that you dont see us turn red! lolz|`|UTgz8yNnaa	look alot but not too much um very nervous|`|Tf19RETiaa	yea sometimes|`|rO56gv3Faa	yuppp, and i sound like a dork when i talk to them haha
zWqKuIQuaa	Stop being a weirdo.  If you only emailed her recently dont go bombarding her demanding a reply.  Just wait to see her in person and say hi.
2LZbzvY3aa	I am in a long distance relationship (not entirely, we live an hour away but only meet up on weekends).  It was HARD at first, we fought a lot.  But it turned out after we talked it was just the same misunderstandings.  I wanted him to talk more to me, see more because I figured he would want to because he would miss me.  In reality, he wanted to talk and see more but he had so much studying to do it wasn't possible.  I would get my feelings hurt, he would think I don't care about him because my feelings were hurt, each of us thought we were right, but it just came down to understanding the root of the problem and each other    Things are so much better now.  We really understand each other and have worked out really good plans.    Try talking with him and getting to the bottom of it, otherwise, you will probably have 1-2 small problems that will surface in many different ways.  I think that's what causes the feeling of being annonyed, the same thing over and over coming up you'd like to avoid but can't.    Try it!  If you love him it's more than worth it!  And the long distance isn't permenant!  Always remember that!  Good luck :)|`|t8gWcBaeaa	long distance relationships r hard.  deal wit it:)|`|kl1kzlzXaa	don't sweat the small stuff. long distance relationships are kind of stupid unless you were already together for a while (like years). If he's getting obsessive, just tell him you need to go and hang up, but you should explain what about his behavior bothers you. He may not realize how annoying it is.
rO56gv3Faa	well, get a girlfriend, and buy her pantyhose.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Plenty of girls wear them from time to time, it doesn't mean they will wear them all the time just because you want them to. You are more likely to find a woman wearing them during the winter months, as it is often too hot to wear them in the summer months.
UwQPH7eHaa	"How can i make her realize that she should go out with me?"    You can't. Maybe she's just not that into you. Listen to Tom Leykis. You sound like a nice guy. You shouldn't be texting girls that are your "friends". Either she's into doing what you want to do and being with you or she is using you as "friend material". You've let this go on for too long already. Either you are her "friend" or her "man". Stop trying to be "friends" with girls and texting them and all that crap. Platonic guys get no booty.    Also, since she's younger than you she might be too immature or not ready. Those two years make a big difference. Has she ever had a boyfriend before? She probably doesn't know what she wants or what she's doing.    Be honest with this chick about what you want to do. Make efforts to take her out, or do things for her if she's willing to go along with you. If she's not kick her *** to the curb and find someone else.    If this chick says she doesn't want to be with you because you're moving away, dump her and find a chick who will be with you. You think she's hot now, but when you go away to college the girls will be 1,000,000 times hotter than that 15 year old you're drooling over now, trust me. Don't put her pussy on a pedestal. Please.    Chicks who are not down, get their asses kicked to the curb QUICK. Chicks want confident guys. When you chase them around, you'll just get crapped on.|`|gT8pKRbjaa	you see that whole awesome paragraph you wrote just there,  send a text to her saying the exact same thing just replace all the pronouns with 'YOU"  and then put a big ol WTF at the end|`|Tltbbjafaa	ok well if ur never comin back tell her youll stay or just say things like i stay with u ilu or like tell her how u truly feel and she should fall for u n dont take things to quickly trust me on that 1|`|9cHgYtPOaa	Sounds like you're trying to hard bro. You sound a bit desperate. If I were you I would treat her the way she's treating you. one of two things could happen. She could miss you chasing after her and want you back or she could just not say anything. If she does wind up not saying anything then she obviously wasn't interested in you anyways. My advice would be to find someone that would appreciate every last minute they could have with you, and doens't mine having a simple conversation with you in the hallway.    -Good luck dude|`|OKLBCesVaa	Quit stalking her, and give her some room to breathe! See if she comes around to you in a week or two. If not, let it go and find someone else.    Maybe she sees you only want pretty girls, not the inner soul interest you should be having!|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	She is trying to tell you that she doesn't want to be in a relationship. You should back off with the texting and trying to make her talk to you all the time. Because she might get annoyed if you keep hounding her. You can't force people to go out with you, and even if they go on a couple of dates with you, that doesn't mean they are going to like you. You just can't force people to like you. Either they do or they don't. And it doesn't have anything to do with you. It's all about compatibilty and attraction. If she doesn't want to date you, there is another girl who will.|`|0hyytT8Eaa	she may be playing hard to get or she doesn't want to get attached b/c your going away.
RiLqR2r8aa	if it is...    its extreme flirting..    she sounds like a nasty piece of work!!|`|n7XFyQvuaa	That's just acting stupid & immature.  She is going to end up with the STD.  Tell her to grow up.|`|53b5975e1584d237eac9cb0d0fc5d848aa	what grade r u in if u in high school naa she just hates u and if shes middle schooler then she might like you|`|OHqRZ9Tzaa	lmfao! are you serious? no!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bmoCpcdraa	tell her you got it from her than see what happens|`|ubj2hZWZaa	maybe ignoring her would help. stop letting her slap you; move or something. she is assaulting you not flirting.|`|3jMsJXjGaa	Uhhh sorry buddy but thats not flirting.  does she sound like shes joking?  is she smiling?|`|osoTq2dcaa	kick her A** thats not flirting what a nut|`|EMCKaSF7aa	It's flirting if you're six.  Above that age I would have to say no.|`|AA11334468	Yes she wants you all to herself  So she's making you less appealing to the other girls|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	If it is flirting that's a sick way to do it. She is messing up your character. You need to tell her to stop.  Maybe she has an STD????|`|STPmyVw5aa	sounds like a screwed up chick|`|cAPf4kdIaa	no she is just being a bit(h sorry|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	you need to slap the f*** out of that wacko  b***h than spread around she was seen at local dr. office crying cause she has crabs or the clap then one will f**k w/ that wacko again.. or get a bad *** b***h to kick her ***|`|mLaKT9O4aa	If she slaps you then you should call the cops.|`|5dk8vkXuaa	yeah probably|`|TdygmSgXaa	rofl yea.. but slaping hard.. what the..|`|j48cLUiLaa	not really. i thinks shes just mean. flip her off. or she just dont know how to express her fellings to you.|`|8BhRg78daa	If you have a folder, you're probably too young to be talking to girls that know about stds. Stay away from her.|`|UVhHRw7Naa	he-all no|`|RGFrGl7Caa	no thats  not flirting,,,thats being a brat it depends if they r good rumors|`|ZyBLhQntaa	Thats just rude! Teach her to mind her own bussiness!|`|99qFzxCxaa	probably is being a ***** and doesn't know it|`|80KFJGMZaa	It's harrassment. Call the cops.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	I'm thinking that  this question is a joke. How can you let someone hit you? Punch her back!|`|smFjFknKaa	nahh i dont thinkk soo|`|4k5AAm8Daa	wtf. no lol slap that b@%^ haha.  Gotta keep yo pimp pants strong!  (lol you will only get it if you saw kicking and screaming..)   but seriously. no its not thats being an idiot.|`|1thElV58aa	When a girl likes a guy she likes to mess with him, playful punches or sticks her tongue at you, but if she spreading rumors about you thats not even being playful that girl has some kind of grudge on you, maybe this is her method of showing how she likes you... *p.s Normal girls would never such a thing.        she sounds like a brat. if you she says "(name) got stds tell* tell her its not my fault i got it from you, give her a evil grin.. walk away...    to can play that game.|`|ySP5Jc9raa	wait...noooo.....she would never do that if it is flirting...be serious around her and then she will stoop!!!|`|fkpbMPXxaa	slap the *****!|`|mVPBkUWSaa	No, that's being a brat.|`|xP5Kw9Eyaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1778363 6dzz5z5...|`|Ln3udE3Zaa	No, that's being a complete *****. I'm sorry she's like that to you.|`|E6kJE2x2aa	That doesnt sound like flirting that just sounds like shes being mean if thats the way she flirts I feel bad for her|`|tQdIbQoVaa	that's evil flirting... or she just doensn't like you LOL  depends on what type of girl she is. For me, i don't think i'd do that. isn't it kind of mean?  except the drawing on your folder part, i suppose.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Good lord, that's ridiculous.  She's got a crappy way of flirting if spreading STD rumors is all she can come up with.|`|hUa56Hfqaa	That depends on the type of girl, mate. If she's a punk or alternative kinda girl, she might like you. But if she's a prep, she's most likely just slapping you :)    Hard to tell sometimes. Most of the time. Ok always. I kid, I kid.|`|owjZhOOhaa	she probably is flirting with you and don't know how to really let you know. but to be honest why is she slapping you in your face?|`|bKfPTscVaa	thats not flirting, maybe she's jus tryna get attention.|`|9GKN6qPbaa	That's not flirting bud.  I'm sorry.  She sounds like a real prep.  Do you like her? that is the question.|`|4fBXhYqSaa	no thats being a brat and you should freken like kill her or something.|`|UNuJipGbaa	Yes. She wants to DO it. Slap her butt next time and wink|`|P8xecnQLaa	maybe a little flirting, but more like bullying! stand up for yourself and tell her to stop doing that!|`|1rvf2Gdhaa	nope,  that's just how a dried up, dirty yeast infected  c u n t   would behave.  and do you know how to tame a  c u n t?  Bang it.|`|A3tg75UDaa	Start telling everybody that she's the one that gave you the STD.|`|cWuZrQssaa	no that's a Perfect description of a dumb b***h, "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"    tell everyone her moms a prostitute and her dad left her when she was a baby. jk|`|hnXTR8Wwaa	It could be...it depends on what age. And maybe she doesn't even know she likes you and does all this stuff. If you don't like her back tell her to get away and stop bothering you.     If she doesn't like you, she's a brat    Peace.|`|AA11974702	its hard to judge, best thing to do is talk to her and ask her why. if there's no apparent reason of all these sorties then tell her to stop annoying you..then live peacefully and happily ever after ^_^
5uEAHEQJaa	Nope, hit it and quit it.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	A lie is a lie is a lie is a lie and on and on and on   Oh i thought that virgins were extinct!|`|9GDBpl8Faa	It depends on you. If she would lie about that, maybe she would lie about other things.|`|qUmZCJ79aa	AHHH NO!|`|b4Et4cpraa	Sure that is a pretty big secret. How do you know she lied. She may not have consented to the sex.|`|Cw1am0Gnaa	i wouldn't!|`|xgui1LAFaa	Last time my friends ex said to him "im a virgin, well i got raped" she really didnt and cheated on him so you make your decision. if she is starting the "relationship" by lying then she must not be serious, correct?|`|dqw1iH6haa	:O :O :O|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I'll need more information.|`|1gJ92tJaaa	depends how long youve been in the relationship. but i probably wouldnt trust her because if shes going to hide that from you it can be bad.|`|wE2etBzbaa	No, you can't . unless she didn't lie and you only doubt.|`|VSyKETqQaa	yeah. it is hard for a girl to admit she isnt a virgin because of double standards. if a girl has sex people think she is a hoe so dont be mad at her about lying, i mean if she ended up telling the truth.. who cares?|`|F5gtYbDVaa	are youuuuuuu a virgiinnnnn??? :o|`|pBPSyAicaa	You need to think about the severity of the lie. How did you find out, did she tell you herself? She might have just been embarrassed. Think about other things she's done, is she a generally trustworthy person? If not, you have your answer. Don't let one slip up ruin the relationship unless it was intentionally hurtful of deceptive.|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	Yes.    She probably lied because guys are fixated on that kind of stuff. Guys want a virgin but they would have more fun in bed with someone who knew what they were doing and had fun doing it..    Are you a virgin? If yes, maybe thats why it bothers you so much. If no, why do you care? You've been around the block too. It's tit for tat.|`|zzkehstbaa	i wouldnt .|`|jQkEsxSqaa	nope.|`|ipDfMHSZaa	prolly not|`|ebL3eyBYaa	how did you find out she wasnt?|`|waIPnxwJaa	Nio.|`|bacgwHhOaa	Proably, if she did lie it was proably though it would be the best thing to telll you at the time...|`|tLNb8L8Vaa	well r u a virgin? if not then yes! haha but how do you know she's lying?|`|sAurzXsEaa	Lying about something like that is very serious! I think I wouldnt but see I am a girl! But if my boyfriend lied to me about that his butt would be gone!! U dont lie about something like that sorry dude u just dont!!!|`|8hIUOajLaa	Doubtful, a relationship cannot function properly without trust.|`|IGXE3aDraa	I wouldn't trust her|`|eYpE4bp2aa	No, no, no, no, no ...    If she lied about something as major as that, then what is to say that she won't lie about other things? Leave NOW -- unless you just wanna hit it and quit it -- then stay as long as you need to.|`|AA11315360	Well the question is why did she lie. You need to ask her that. If she was embarrassed about it then maybe that is why she lied. Or it was only 1 time and she hated it and regrets it that could be the reason. If she lied because she was embarrassed, regretted the past, or wanted you to like her more and thought you wanted only a virgin then yes you can trust her about other things.  IF she lied for a sinister reason then no dont trust her again. BUT you have to talk to her.|`|0PUhA2XLaa	Are you a virgen? Whats the difference? We all have needs and desires. That includes woman. Get over it FAST!|`|MAPXbHdnaa	you can trust her. she was probably just embabrrused or thought you wouldnt like her or something..|`|qvNeo0G8aa	Ok first off, your girlfriend is an idiot. There are MANY things one can lie about in life and get away with. Being a virgin is NOT one of these things. It's kinda obvious.    Second, you used the words 'girl' and 'trust' in the question. I am officially offended. Treat them as you would an alien...  Vast, cool intellects, far beyond the comprehension of mere males, they will do what they want, when they want, for no good reason and never let on to you that they did it.    To all the girls who post afterwards like "blahblah whatever you suck", just think how many men you have punked. TODAY.  Then over the week.  The month.  Your life.    Prosecution rests.|`|q1FNzEQCaa	NO!|`|pT2ZKo4haa	whats a virgin|`|WnRy6on6aa	maybe she's just ashamed of not being a virgin. (or being a virgin. whichever applies to you. i'm assuming she's NOT a virgin)    she probably likes you a lot and didn't want you to know so that you would respect her more.|`|JkWgb58Jaa	Absolutely. Did you ask her why she lied about that? Probably because she didnt want you to think of her in a bad way (like thinking she is easy or whatever). Now if she lies about how many sex partners then there may be a trust issue.|`|hMQfxTNPaa	ask her if you could trust her.  if she says yes, then trust her but be aware and look after yourself too. you never know, she may end up lying to you.|`|hK7lc0kNaa	NO because she will just end up telling you the truth about ever thing she told you that you thought was true.  But that doesn't mean do anything that will end your relationship.  Just ask her about things, and see if she says the same as last time.  Your Welcomes dawg!  lol            (:|`|QCwgcPFoaa	Yes and no. There might be a valid reason why she lied to you. It may be because she perceives you to be the type who judges a person by their virginity. I mean, who in this time of the century, is still a virgin at the age of 15? You're lucky if they still are. Nevertheless, a person would only lie to you if they don't trust you. So, if I were you, I would confront her and ask why she lied to me and that it wouldn't matter if she's a virgin or not. If you love her, then it shouldn't, right? If you don't, why bother? You don't need trust on a summer fling.
8dbfb63772d364bd83640bbe06e40607aa	dreams are reflections of day time. so if you think about her throughout the day it means your dreams can be about her. if you relly love her and your emotions all fall back to her, then you miss her. you should apologize--fighting is just wasting time for the both of you. life is short..dont waste it.. =]|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Well she will end up haunting you in your nightmares in time.|`|DCIPrG1gaa	Maybe she's heavy on your subconscious. Maybe you feel guilty about the fight, or maybe you're just thinking about her a lot.
b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	ok this is what you need to do...pretend your cool with just being friends..give her the idea that you can understand and this will hopefully bring you guys closer ..she might start having more coversations with you wants to hang around with you more..and hopefully if everything goes good she will fall in love with you...just remember to be funny when around girls they love that...well i wish you good luck hope this works =)|`|QddOKwnIaa	If she doesn't want to be more than friends, good luck changing her mind|`|SF6lYLImaa	Firstly, it sounds like this girl is kind of a tease.  Some girls just like to screw with guys because it makes them feel powerful or something.  Also, when she had a boyfriend you were "off limits" and that makes it more appealing.    Also, you are in high school, and at that time, people just get tired of each other for no reason.  Believe me, I was in high school for four years, and I know that most people in high school are idiots.  Both guys and girls.    If she's like that, then she'd probably end up tossing you to the side eventually anyway.  Don't waste your time.

Whatever you do is  going to hurt someone. Be warned  the one  who  suffers  the most hurt  could be you! - If you have  an  ounce of decency in your  bones  you will think long and hard before  proceeding down  break up road. If there is an opportunity to patch things  up then  take it because it will be easier than  splitting up.      Once you have made your mind  up  then  you have  to tell the other  person involved open and honestly  what  and  why you  are  breaking up. Once its all out in the open you will then have to  make plans on what to do next, Its not going to be easy specially of  kids are involved,  estranged wives and partners  can use emotional blackmail to great effect. A woman's or child's  tears  can  stab   you in the heart and make you feel horrible which will undoubtedly cause  depression and stress for you.    Relationship break ups are  hard on everyone  involved, you may be thinking that  once away from  the relationship all will be well, this may be the case, but  from experience i know that  often its not the  case and hardship and  emotional turmoil  follows which can be  very difficult to cope  with.

Happy Valentines Day!|`|fKtDQvidaa	that sounds fine, maybe put a bar of chocolate in the stuffed animals hand|`|kwMzmQ4Naa	it depends on what kind of girl she is, if shes very main-stream then yea i think she'll like it. if she's a lil artsy/ creative then step it up a notch. last year my boyfriend came on feb 13th with a freshly baked cookie stuffed with my fav ice cream an a snickers bar(also my fav), he also brought me a monkey that had nothing to do with pink, red or hearts, just a monkey. it was the sweeetest thing ever cuz he said he didn't need a holiday to show me how much he loved me.|`|80KFJGMZaa	A really big stuffed animal, or something you made yourself. That always works =D|`|igvu3ifUaa	too typical. go with a date. take her out. something she can get dressed up for. like dinner and a show. we always have things like musicals and stuff from traveling teams at our community college, so if you have one check it out and see what they have. it doesnt have to be on valenties day. but if its after, give her a cute little card that says just wait and see.|`|6x1OlqIzaa	I think flowers and a card would be nice. NOT a stuffed animal, but that's just me. :)    Good luck!

7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	Bad idea.  Most strippers are used to having large amounts of money come in each week, and they usually have no shortage of men trying to get into their pants (read that as, even if you make her your girlfriend, the temptation to cheat will be there *all the time*).  Their sense of time and commitments tends to be very loose, and quite a few of them are either involved in criminal activities (theft, drugs, etc.), have sexually transmitted diseases, or both.    If you have significant personal wealth, you *might* be able to date one for a little while.  But given that (on average) most other women will give you fewer problems, are more trustworthy, and are generally nicer, I would suggest dating them instead.|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	tpain - im in love with a stripper.     Listen to it|`|eJVmg7j6aa	Dude listen to me....SHE IS A STRIPPER!!!!...Do u really want a girl who has been and will be dancing with and on top of other dudes naked...basically wat ever u did with her she will do with others...Im sorry if u like her but Im telling u there are other fish in the see....|`|WVPYgaeAaa	ok first of all there is the possibility you could get AIDS. now for the serious answer..    I have been to strip clubs before and those girl are all about making money.  If you dated a stripper could you really handle her going to work everyday and having her dance all over other men and make rude comments about her.  Not everyone respects strippers, but if your ok with people saying stuff like that about the girl you date, then you should go right ahead and date a stripper.|`|5SPHgdsRaa	strippers are one step below hookers and hookers are one step below porn stars. there all women with no morals and messed up lives and would rathe rbe iwht another womn really than a guy anyway and not to mentioned there there as a job to make money and make you guys think they like tyou for another $100 bill in there hands:) but the only way for you to learn is the hard way of expireance which is the best way:) so take it as a learning moment in life.. have fun

pwRauVnKaa	chatting and messaging to guys should be fine as long as she isn't pretending or faking that she isn't in a relationship. If you feel like you can't trust this girl maybe you shouldn't be with her but if you are confident that she is not misleading you into a false sense of security hold onto it. Insecurities is a big threat and you could end up losing everything because of nothing.|`|GOYPKp3Baa	Well, you can't really assume what she's talking about with these guys. So it's just you being paranoid, just chill out. Let her have some freedom, it's fine. And if you dont think so, then tell her. Talk to her about it, but believe me, I think she'll get mad as to why you're paranoid over this. good luck!
RuJhWnS5aa	Here's a wild thought, bare with me!    Have you ever tried watching porn yourself?  It might sound utterly ridiculous.  But I think porn is much more than something dirty, it's a learning tool.  It's stuff they don't put in textbooks.  Guys can develop their fantasies by watching porn.  And if you know what his fetishes are, you can use it to your advantage!  Especially if you're not comfortable with your sexuality.  By trying to find out what you're attracted to, you'll get more confidence in your love life.    PS - it's hard to wrap your mind around it, but pornstars are nothing but big boobs and butts.  Don't believe me?  Try masturbating to someone attractive you're not that into.  Maybe someone you don't know.  When you're horny, you don't care.  You're just horny.  Try it.  It will change your world.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	He thinks those girls are hotter than you.  And he is probably right.|`|zx4DfJz5aa	DONTT be upset. im a girl, i watch it && i have a boyfriend who pleases me more than the porn i watch. it's not better than u to him or replacing u. its strictly fun for him. it doesnt mean ur not good enough or are lacking what he wants sexually. my boyfriend is more than fulfilling and i still watch it from time to time : D|`|Lv8WlCPTaa	You shouldn't take that.  Many relationships have failed due to porn, and my one friend's parents are an example.  Tell him to give it up or give you up.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Well step it up and make realize your way sexier than any porn star.    If he wanted better, then he would go out and get better.|`|STPmyVw5aa	Sara, you shouldn't have to go through this kind of thing in a relationship if he is not willing to change for you then he dose not deserve you. talk to him.|`|2afVnStxaa	Don't let yourself feel inadequate. When guys watch porn it does not necessarily mean that you are any less interesting to them that what they see on that screen. The truth is that when we guys watch porn if we are in a relationship, we are really watching to give US ideas on how to please YOU better. However, this being said, it usually takes us many years to realize that women do not usually like the things we see on that screen. But, if you are this adamant about being better than the videos, (please know that you are because above all you are real), all you need to do is maybe be a bit more adventurous in the bedroom. But truth is, if he isn't asking you to try any of this he is satisfied in that area already and he is just doing something that many guys do, and it has nothing at all to do with you. Any psychiatrist or sex therapist would tell you this, there are two types of guys, those who masturbate and those who lie about it. But they will also tell you that 90% of the men/guys that masturbate and watch porn who can be open about it with the women they are with are far less likely to cheat. The masturbation and the healthy fantasy life is not only good for him it is good for the relationship. My advice to you is to let it go, he loves you, but he is keeping himself content to be with only you by having some healthy fantasies. Let him have it, I bet in a few years he gets over it and stops watching them. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.|`|fKtDQvidaa	if i were you, i WOULD MIND if he watched porn or not, and i think you have the same feeling, and your telling yourself you dont|`|om0zcFigaa	Create porn. ;) and maybe show it to me... lol jk.|`|igBds5Lhaa	well its okay for him to watch pron as long as it does not interfere with your relationship. as long as he does not enjoy porn over you you should be fine and as long as he respects you if you tell him you don't want him to watch it while your around.|`|gGiLHuqlaa	maybe having sex with him will calm him down|`|fusc1cykaa	You mean u don't feel good enough when you see all those hot bitches and how they do it good (sexually)? They are all good in bed at what they do..its porn its acting they have to be. Why don't you take tips from porn, learn from it, become better yourself in the bedroom. Thats what I did. It pays off.|`|xUCXXb73aa	porn is a fantisie panic when he dosent come home at night|`|lEWSVn87aa	Slap him right in the face =] Put some sense into him.  What does he think he's doing?  If he loves you, he should be spending more time with you than watching porn.  Have sex :]|`|JH6oCuUZaa	If he watches porn because he can not come to you for his needs you have a right to feel bad, but if he watches porn as a distraction or a way of dealing with his own feelings give him space.

Im sure he will get upset sence im sure the dudes in the porno have bigger penis's than him.    If he doesnt like you watching it than tell him you dont like him watching it.      :)    See how he responds to that! :)|`|uke9Ysrvaa	well he's probably not satisfied with you because(dont that it too deeply, cause im really not sure) but most people mature more when they are going out with someone, maybe you should try talking to him.|`|CVctxlupaa	you need to tell him to get his teenager habits over with, and just tell him what you wrote here|`|sbyZ1VKiaa	tell him how you feel and if he really loves you then he'll listen. and if he doesn't then he's just not worth your time.|`|TyWPCqEraa	yeah its not really a bad thing, but to much of it isn't ok, let him know how you feel, and hell if its occasionally then watch it with him, its healthy for couples to experience things like that together, just make sure to ask him if your pleasing him enough, these are things you need to have out in the open in a relationship.|`|hnXTR8Wwaa	Omigawd lady, if you want this realationship to last, talk to him about it.

If he doesn't stop or he starts to rationalize then you know it's time to say bye, bye and go find a real man.|`|Dc1PLsZqaa	well i think is that u should do the same thing 2 c if he lks it if not just turn the tv off and turn him on make ur own porn u know ur man u know wt he lks and wt he does not lk but NEVER think bad about ur self always be confident and think he is curies its better for him 2 be watching porn than him doing smt else just watch it with him may be he will want 2 try some moves and there you go u both hit JACKPOT lol good luck =)|`|Hdyc9VR4aa	just remember this. the girls in porn are all sluts and do nasty things. You are his girlfriend who he loves and cares about. He is a guy... maybe porn helps him release those nasty fantasies he has...I dunno?  I am a girl so it's just a guess.    BUT...    I had a boyfriend once who pointed out a girl and said "she looks really hot. But the type of hot who guys just want to **** and throw away the next day. That's what porn is. your his girlfriend... the type of girl he wants to love and hold on too.     so maybe thats what porn is to a guy?     Hope this helps?

Lucky for me he was patient, and we've been together for 3 years. We are getting married at the end of this year.  Just be honest with him, and if it's meant to be, he will wait.

But if he means it like love and you don't feel the same, that is what I do normally is say "you too" Sorry if this doesn't help.|`|UzvoQvB2aa	I know this sounds kind of cheesy but I loved my husband the first time I saw him however it took him at least a year to return the favor love is just an emotion like happiness or sadness nothing els it's not as deep as people like to think it is you ether feel it or you don't|`|alowAmfqaa	LIESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!|`|vCdd5N92aa	be like do you really love me or are you just saying that?   be up front and ask ya knowww.|`|QaELVeGaaa	Some guys aren't sincere when they say it, some are. It depends.. so I mean if you do not love him, but like him a lot, tell him that. When he says, "I love you", simply respond- "I really like you a lot, but I think it's too soon to love you." There's a difference between loving someone and being IN LOVE with someone. You don't want to lie and say you do because it could backfire against you.|`|xyTerKjLaa	He is obviously insecure is that he wants you to tell him you love him back. He DOESN'T love you because he DOESN'T know you. Not saying he doesn't care about you but . . . this reminds me of my ex.    My suggestion is NOT to say it if you don't mean it and explain to him why you can't say it. If he's hurt by it then that's unfortunate for him but TRUST ME he doesn't love you, he loves the idea of you. Especially because you've only met twice.    Good luck and be careful!|`|4gr4ro4haa	well some 1 lovs u and that is a good thing unless u r under 13. if u r under 13, tell him its a little early for that commitment. if u r 13 or over, its ur choice. u can either tell him u arent comfortable say that u lov him, but that u like him alot ooooor u can say i love u to and that u care about him and cherrish him from dayin and day out. more like follo ur heart. wat do u feel is rite? if u really care alot about him, u mite be in lov with him and u mite not even no. i say take a shot at it. see how he reacts and if he feels that he cares so much about u, u mite want to ask him out. plus u guys mite want to see each other jus a lil more. hey he mite be the guy that u wanted in ur life.
AA11317051	There's a guy like that in my life, but he's by ex boyfriend, but we're still really good friends which i why i feel like i can tell him anything. I don't like him at all romantically but he is like my best friend.|`|SSDJWQfIaa	yes..  we're best friends and we never seem to like each other beyond that.. even though a lot of people do not believe that we're just friends, it's true. our relationship is platonic. We're sweet towards each other but we really just see ourselves as sort of like siblings..
O3ZI4jeCaa	Obviously those guys are still immature and needs to grow up. I hate those type of people even though I am a guy myself.|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Perhaps you should examine your "friends" a little more closely and decide if you're with the right people. On a personal note, I happen to be very selective.|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes as long as they have a papper bag|`|igkbUflbaa	Of COURSE we care about appearance, and how a person Carry's them self. Were you eating lunch with losers?|`|VMAhim63aa	first, use common sense and realize not all guys are the same  second, your friends disgust me|`|69x3A1zwaa	we care and there are limits lol|`|jmzKBenBaa	breasts is only wat a shallow guy thinks about...|`|7zMMXmfWaa	that's only true for some very desperate guys.|`|63ZHUr88aa	PROBABLY...WERE PIGS LOOK WHAT THIS GUYS DOIN TO HIS GIRLFRIEND....PRETTY FRICKEN MEAN IF YOU ASK ME http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1778382 6dzz5z5...|`|6x1OlqIzaa	Can you say......    DESPERATE?|`|ghItgMZxaa	NO  some guys all they care about is getting laid and there are others out there that do really care.|`|7dmmgSVfaa	no,never,  those guys must be either kidding or they worth not talking about,  because good guys never talk on f**king their gf,  they say "to make love with......"|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Anything but a turkey lol|`|eJVmg7j6aa	Look there are animals and there are Men...Some immature men behave like animals and just think about sex and men actually have sum sort of standards and look for women that they could enjoy spending time with....unfortunately in this world there are sum animals who would probably bang a retarded girl.... don't worry every guy has standards....but also sometimes guys just look for a girl they wanna bang and sometimes they look for a girl they wanna be more with ya know...|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	are you saying its not alright for guys to hook up with girls that arnt good looking?  maybe they cant get any good looking girls because the good looking girls have to high of standards.     Maybe there doing an ugly girl a favor or courtesy if you will|`|MRTqKEdJaa	okay well, MOST guys look at appearance too.  but yeah, all they really want is you vaggg, so who knows?|`|YDNpsYjuaa	haha. some will|`|BpyZUhK6aa	My opinion is that there are many guys that would but also alot of guys who wouldnt. Alot of the time guys say those things mess around with there friends or to show off and act funny. Hope this helps! :D|`|9rNNOEnwaa	Yes they will. You should see the thing my guy was messing around with. hell I think it is a guy.|`|CVctxlupaa	not only appearance, but also who tha girl is, i dont' care how hot she is, if i don't like her for whatever reason, then no, and even so, i don't go around hooking up with every girl i could hook up with,   just because she's hot it doesn't mean every guy would ****, but then again probably the majority of guys would  don't generalize, but do take it into account, just don't assume lol|`|8FBX7aFNaa	ok these guys probably are trying to pull off the macho type and act like they just want *** cuz they are insecure. guys really want a girl who looks youthful and healthy with a pretty face because thats how they are wired to keep our race alive.|`|G9BfImM3aa	i certainly care about appearance, but to a certain extent. i love a great personality and all that ****...but the girl has to be pretty good looking. i always feel bad for being that way, but i can't change it... i wouldnt **** anything with breasts, especially not some dude with manboobs...some guys might be into that though. i speak for myself.|`|QyVXlmvQaa	Nooooooooooooooooooo guys care about appearance. 90% of what the average guy looks for in a girl (or at least what i look for in a girl) is cuteness.... meaning Pretty eyes, face, etc. And a cute personality is always fun.. :).   And yeah since sex feels really good... and some guys cant get it.. they lower their expectations.. sometimes a lot.. i mean thats good in a way so everybody gets their fix :)
aLgY4l3Naa	Well it most definitely does not sound like a healthy relationship, So the real question is how much do you really care for him and love him?? Is it enough that you are willing to sit down and have a serious talk to him about all this that is bothering you and try and work these problems out?? Are you willing to walk the mile or two to make this happen come rain or shine?? You really need to think on these things and make a conscious decision on what you really want or need to do, its not just about you, there is another involved here who is in the position of getting hurt as well as you!! I really think that your boyfriend needs to get some counseling and it would not hurt if you supported him in that if you decide to stay!! What ever you do you need to do soon, don't prolong this because its not good for either of you at this point, something needs to be done and NOW! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!!|`|VajrBj7Saa	Dump him, i've experienced that before. He is a complete jerk and if he drives you crazy that's definitely not a good sign. He is insecure and guys that are insecure are not stable. So prevent hurting yourself by dumping him first or else in the long run, you'll be the one ending up with a broken heart.|`|IGr9NMhTaa	this sounds....like a train wreck waiting to happen. I'm not sure how you should handle this, but it seems like your guy has serious issues. Like counselor worthy. And i don't mean to offend you or him, but it really seems like a VERY unhealthy relationship.
RAyRGH1Saa	well i think you shuold give him a chance if you like him  and if it seems like he is in it for one thing, move on.    i think he could like you but then again some people are hard to read        help with the last question i put up?
O83zDG02aa	some guys tend to stay out of a relationship so they can concentrate on school and then afterwords start a relationship.|`|BRg8RNPjaa	He's not into you... sorry.|`|wrhRjwKaaa	I would say it makes sense, if he's really into his future, and wants to get good grades, then give him some space, but I would totally just have a chill talk, and be like "so, just wondering, do you really not want a relationship, or are you not into me" and make sure you don't care what he answers, and make sure he knows that.|`|VMAhim63aa	he's just not that into you...|`|BYTPpcNZaa	i dont know, ask him and find out|`|T9VFEZVEaa	Everyone has to make choices in life.    If he has chosen to focus on study and you're working against that choice then you're really not helping him.  Your choices are to support him or move on.|`|DytfqrkSaa	I was in a similar situation for school, and I didn't dump my girlfriend. I just explained to her that we aren't going to talk as much. If he were to say that to you, then you can either support him as he's trying very hard in school, or you can leave him and move on to another guy. The choice is yours.     Good Luck!  Ryan|`|psLk5fDGaa	It could be both. School's stressful! Maybe he really doesn't have the time for a girlfriend. My guess is that if you are second guessing it, it is probably the latter. Go with your gut instincts.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	He is just not that into you. It wouldnt matter for his credit you all arent married.
UUx74K5Caa	Get a hobby.|`|bmoCpcdraa	buy a toy they work well|`|MVY8xhXlaa	buy a puppy!!|`|9f2a8c2fc0c46b5194e8fbb0bd809056aa	masturbate like crazy so you won't be so horny and go shopping or do what you like to do|`|che6yXYNaa	when he gets his orders to be stationed... it will be hard just please be faithful i cant stress it enough...|`|SUG8wXmUaa	Aww honey that's the worst. It hurts when you love someone so much and then they have to go away for a bit. Nothing will replace his warmth, and him being there. Although there are some things you can do to make it better. If your used to him sleeping in the bed with you just buy a body pillow, and cuddle that while he is away. As for the being lonely thing there isn't really anything that can fix that, but there is stuff that can help ease the pain. Try to keep yourself busy, what I do to keep myself busy is I went to a arts and crafts store, and bought a bunch of stuff that looked fun. Listen to music, watch a movie, go for a run, play a computer game, go get a makeover or have a spa day. Do something for yourself every once in a while, to make you feel refreshed and good about yourself. As for the sexual thing well honey your going to have to visit a Lovers Package, or some type of sex shop in your area, and purchase a little friend if you know what I mean lol. Good luck honey. Hope I helped.|`|MqHA2zz5aa	depends on if your married or just dating. and what he's in training for. I know something like DLI can last up to two years, if you arent married, forget about it for that timespan.|`|ATi8OOKQaa	TRUTHFULLY THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE YOUR FINGERS AND THAT WILL HELP YOU FROM CHEATING ON HIM...BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE LONELY.....|`|b2ff4dadc6912ad179693e62eea914d6aa	Buy a vibrator|`|FTvhr9fLaa	I completely understand. No sex toy replaces the warmth of a partner. You should find some hobbies with your friends and family.  Other than that Im not sure what to recommend for you to do while your soldier is away. If you talk on the phone with him, Why not try phone sex? sexy letters?      GOOD LUCK,    November Rain|`|G7ZDmKleaa	I don't necessarily have an answer for this.  I just wanted to say i'm sorry about that and i hope you get through it and everything works out well.    But, you should get a puppy, or anything that can keep you company or hang out with friends, maybe travel.    My boyfriend is gone a lot because he's in show business, and he gave me a puppy for Christmas, and it keeps me company when he's gone, the puppy is my best friend :)    Good luck :)|`|aF1IXKjTaa	get a hobby or a pet
bmoCpcdraa	mono menigitis your to young|`|77NzfiVkaa	I think you are. I know at 14 I didn't know what love was and I'm glad I was 16 when I had my first kiss because it was something I look back on fondly because it wasn't with some guy I just had a crush on, it was with someone I loved.|`|azY3Qmjdaa	its the threshold to all the other things you should not be doing at your age. It starts with kissing, then it leads to more physical contact. But as long as you know your limits and you have the maturity to understand, she should not be so strict. You are a good girl and your mother is overreacting.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I think your mom is seriously overreacting.  Maybe there is something in her past that makes her think you will turn into a slut for kissing.|`|QK4r41Hqaa	I think you shouldn't be alloud to kiss because you do not understand that it IS a big deal.  It's not something that should be taken lightly- like popculture is telling everyone.|`|crPZVBexaa	Well I am married and have only kissed five guys in my life. I was 11 when I got my first kiss (6th grade). But I would be very choosy who you kiss so people (guys) might not think more about it.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	No. Your mom just thinks you're growing up too fast.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Don't let your mom watch|`|iAhCtXFIaa	tell her to take a chill pill|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	You've never kissed anyone and your mum is yelling at you? Err overprotective much?|`|MVY8xhXlaa	I don't think it's too young, the way you described it    She's probably freaking out because she realizes you're getting older and she's getting worried about your sexuality- sounds like her problem, not yours though|`|2ZZt1etIaa	I'm surprised! 14 is definitely not too young to have your first kiss.    Kissing is normal and acceptable in your teenage years.  I mean if you were a tween still, I'd sort of understand it, but as long as you're being appropriate, kissing is just fine.|`|JsIZ9F0Qaa	I think little kisses(like pecks) are ok for you, but no make-out sessions. Making out can lead to other things...it is just too easy to get carried away even if you plan on never doing anything until you are older or married or whatever. I don't think yelling at you is a good thing either, if you havn't even kissed anyone especially.|`|AJxJAIpAaa	i'm the same age, so no i don't think you are too young. but, i do understand what you're going through. before i say all this, let's clarify i'm not a slut or whore or anything, i hardly date guys. okay, when i made out the first time, it was my first time to go out on a date with my bf. now i know kissing and making out are 2 different things, but still, my mom flipped. she really doesn't care about me kissing, but she wants to "protect me from what the world thinks is okay now days". listen, if your mom doesn't want you kissing, either talk to her about it, or don't do it. you may not think she understands, but i'm almost 100% sure she does. kissing isn't that big of a deal anyway, so if you prove to her you can respect her about the whole kissing thing, when it comes to like, one on one dates, she shouldn't be as uptight thinking you'll go crazy, cause she knows she can trust you. hope this helped:)|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Germs and trouble.|`|xIeNFefYaa	kissing leads to touching  touching leads to *******|`|SsAf9vTraa	14's fine. if you think you're mature enough, then go for it :)|`|wBxXGASgaa	no ur growing up i can't get a girl to kiss me but ur mom is over protected u should date and have a right to kiss anyone|`|2W8Nxao3aa	kissing = alot type    fly kiss  wet kiss  face kiss  lip kiss  etc  but just bare in mind that, u only do it to the person that u love very much~    i m sure ur mom will understand =D|`|8a8CZqGLaa	Because it leads to other things.  I think it's okay at 14, but not the best thing in the world.  2 of my 19 year old (virgin!) friends have never been kissed, and I think it's sweet  Mom's get VERY worried once you hit 13, and your mom sounds a lot like mine. Tell her that by being over bearing about something and not *discussing* it, you're more likely to rebel later on. (what I ended up doing due to my mom irrational-ness and yelling and over protective-ness)|`|3KSTyYKvaa	Let me get this straight, you HAVEN'T kissed a person YET right? then why was your mom yelling at you? Anyway I don't think that 14 is too young but it's so much more meaningful when your older, I would personally wait. Your first kiss is a big deal ( was to me anyway ) that you'll remember for the rest of your life, make that one time special.|`|6LVw80x6aa	nahh 14's fine tell her that im 14 and im getting interested in all that stuff.|`|AA10529334	No I dont think you are too young for a first kiss. And yah your Mom is maybe freaking out a little about it. Its a new thing for her too you know.  Imagine if you had a daughter your age -- how much would you worry about them??    You are not too young but you arent too old either - you have a long way to go before it would be a real issue. Be patient - Mom will come around.|`|7cKskbHjaa	nope my mom looks at me crazy but ive kissed over 15 guys (different) in the last month and im 13 but ive been kissing since 5th grade!      I think you mom is way wrong!    and no boys that doesnt make me slutty i just like kissing! besides there all me exs ;)|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	This is your mom!  Could she encourage anything less of you?  She's pretty passionate about this subject or she wouldn't yell.  An innocent kiss for Grandma or Auntie or even your cousin when you hug and say goodbye is fine I'm sure.  I doubt the kiss your mom is thinking about is quite that simple.  Take your time and don't worry about what kissing is or what you want it to be... it'll come... perfect or not, amazing or not,  embarrasing or not... it'll come.  You are an innocent 14yr old so stick with the innocent Grandma-type kissing!|`|Vk7AvXZPaa	Moms are hard to undersatnd, she doesn't realize your growing up too fast.|`|3b5ba2125169c61883207833cea9b976aa	The first time I kissed someone I was 13, and in a commited relationship with them. Well this person was the first one I ever fell in love with.    Your mom might think it is such a big deal because she might think you are still that little girl she had. I know my mom still thinks I am her little kid who is 5 and does not seem to want to let go of that. I'm 20 today and she still thinks R movies are over my head or I need an adult to go and see a PG 13 movie.     Try and have a talk with her and tell her you are not a little girl anymore and you are growing up and maturing.  But try and be gentle when talking to her and don't get angry Be mature.  For some people it is really hard to let go, especially for some mom's to realize there child is growing up and wants there own independance|`|o0kS2k8Eaa	Well, like others have said kissing leads to other things, and I'm sure your mom knows that. She may have done some things at 14 she wasn't proud of and doesn't want you to do the same things. I know I don't want my daughter to do any of the "bad" things I did when I was a teenager...don't get me wrong, I was a good kid, not perfect, but good and you probably are too. Parents like to think their children are sweet and innocent and they want them to remain that way. Time flies and your mom probably doesn't want you to grow up. She's probably just emotional and passionate about certain things like you and is just looking out for you. I also think that you are too young to be kissing anyone right now; wait a couple of years.|`|YT48OTKzaa	hi 14 i can understand why your mom is yelling at you one is becouse of you age and 2 is   some times an inncent kiss could lead o other thing and at this day and time you ave to be very careful about these thing exspecilywith all these different disesses goning around  and beside you get your hold life to think about this kind of stuff   so just trow this out of your head and just constrate on  being a teenager and goning to school and making sothing out of yoiur self and everthing else will fall it toplace when it time|`|Ileht4olaa	you're still too young for that...  in fact you're still too young to be thinking about that...  of course everyone would want their first kiss to be the one they liked but  are you sure that you really like him? isn't it just "oh you like that person now but after a few more days or so you'll realized you don't really like that person that much..."  your mom's just caring for you and wants you to finish school first before thinking about that...|`|Kxk3ZbWMaa	Because kissing leads to touching, and touching leads to sex. She's just being a parent.|`|vNQBpQ6raa	well u re too young and probably from kissing you can get into all other things. You know them|`|Iqol1Qngaa	my first kiss was when i was 14   just don't waste it...you're not too young   you obviously sound like you want to save it for someone  special which is what you should do!!    just don't get carried away with anything else!  goodluck!|`|arXdjAhmaa	young.... but not that young...    kissing isnt bad...  just kiss him when ur mom isnt around :)|`|zD7bHkSyaa	No i don't think your to young to kiss. It's just that she doesn't want you to grow up..

n7uzcdRbaa	Parent begin to believe that they know there kids inside out and know what you are going to say.  I used to finish my daughter's sentences because I could do it quicker than she did.  She taught me to shut up and listen by confronting me about finishing her sentences.  Mum needs to know that you are growing and evolving and still full of new thoughts and surprises.|`|zw2cnUyNaa	Maybe she's busy at the time when you try to talk to her.  Try to ask her when would be a good time to sit down and talk to her, and then you know her full focus will be on listening to you.  If not, mabye you can write her a note telling her what you need to talk to her about, and mabye ask her about sitting down and talking to her that way; and leave the note in a spot where she goes a lot.  I hope that helps!! Good luck!|`|8ZgW4tIiaa	well you should tell her things when she isnt busy or occupied with anything be always calm and when she doesnt listen to u tell her how that hurts u and how u do want to be open and have a relationship but cant because she wont listen to you just tell ur mom how u feel and how it hurts wen shes not hearing u out=] and if that doesnt help maybe u shud give her some time off and then start again and if not u can always tell ur friends and btw u shud sometimes ask for her advice and tell her what she wud do in a situation like u were in hope i helped!!!!|`|G5g8YaaNaa	that was like me a few years ago with my mum  everytime i told my mum something and she would make a big deal out of it or she would turn the problem back on me and say it was all my fault  so what i did was tell her straight forward that she keeps doing it and everytime she does it just tell her and in the end she will get and not do it anymore, well that it what helped me   and now my mum tells me more as an advice not at a big deal   hope i helped!|`|Dxq5TPsjaa	just  force her to talk to u    maybe cook dinner for her ad u one night and sit together and eat together (not in front of the tv) and talk about your problems and issues.

AA11962405	That's easy he or she will tell you they do, and prove it, or at least not make you feel like crap. In any case you will believe or not, regardless if is true or not some will believer other just because they attractive it would be best to go by actual knowledge of the individual who said it by that i mean how often is that person honest, kind and so on.
AA12227208	I'm not a man but I think if you asked which they like better between almost anorexic and big boobs and big butt, I'm almost sure they would choose the big butt/boobs.     Besides, if you are having great sex, that means he's having fun riding those curves...and if you don't like your body, hey, sex burns lots of calories!|`|AA12147519	My wife gained quite a bit while pregnant.  Most happens near the end of pregnancy, so it is a quick change, that sometimes is hard to adjust to.  I noticed the change but never ever said anything or did anything different.  She made it a goal to loose some weight and has been working on it very hard.  I never loved her less, or was any less interested in her because of her weight.  It was a very hard thing her body went through to give me 3 beautiful kids!  I fully understand and love her the more for it!  She is trying to loose weight and although it is a slow process, she is doing good at it.|`|AA12162261	hey don't worry about it i my younger sister went threw the same thing lost the weight not to long ago like in January or February she found that she was pregnant again so she had stop dieting if you really need help on losing weight go see your doctor and ask him if there's any way you can get on a diet pill i know i still use a diet pill hand written by the doctor tho that's the safe way to get help tho.|`|AA10349833	well, curvy women are hot, if you have awesome sex, then it is obvious he like your new body.  i wouldn't worry about it.  the weight will come off.  are you on birth control, if you are, are you on the pill?  the pill will keep weight on, consider getting an IUD so that you do not have to worry about the hormones that make you gain weight.  if you work out, you will gain weight at first, but inches will come off, don't pay any attention to the scale.  I am sure you will go back down to a size in the middle, i think a size 5 is small unless you have a really small frame, a size 9 is perfect, but an 11 or 13 is still good.  you will lose it.  i wear a 15/16 too and i used to wear a 13 not too long ago, but i flip flop on weight, lose in the summer, gain in the winter, sooooooooo..........  you should be losing more weight soon.  it will come off, don't worry, and like i said, obviously he likes your body or he wouldn't be turned on enough to get a hard on or have an orgasm|`|AA10703186	ITS ALL IN HOW YOU FEEL IF YOU DO NOT LIKE YOUR BODY THEN EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS...

Since I've been married (1 1/2 years) I've gained 60+ pounds. I hate my body but I love myself. Because I love who I am I truely believe my husband when he tells me he loves me. You'll be ok. You don't have to loose weight. You're perfect. At least he thinks so...You should too.
AA10278896	First a few corrections:    1.  You "dumped him" NOT you "dumbed him."  2.  The word is "thing" NOT "think"      Now for the question.  You said he "cheated" on you.  I assume this means he had sex with someone else.  This implies that you two were also having sex.  If that is the case then he COULDN'T have cheated on you.  How can it be called cheating when you two weren't married.  He is used to being around girls who are easy (like you.)  You didn't think enough of yourself to withhold sex until marriage so to him sex is nothing special.  Sex is what you do with every girl you meet.  Clearly he is trashy and he is attracted to trashy girls.  It is not fair for you to "boo-hoo" over him screwing another trashy girl.  You never made any commitment to him, he was just someone you liked screwing.  Apparently now hs is tired of you and wants some new gilr to screw.    I say, you better get used to it.  This is the price you pay for living an immoral life.  This will happen to you again and again throughout your life.  People with high morals never have to worry about these kind of problems.|`|AA11695611	Tell him to **** off!!

By any means do not take him back.  He don't love you, otherwise he wouldn't have cheated on you.|`|AA10867193	guess u  wuld  forgive  him .. becoz  he  has  realized    his  mistake    by  now ,  but    keep  a  track on  his  activities  b4  u  decide|`|AA11593956	Sometimes people do stupid things, you could give him a second chance, but you will always be wondering if he is doing it again ya know?|`|AA12376721	move on

It will be nice if you are not too straight forward in asking him out, instead let him do the asking. He most likely has seen some of your advances, but you need to let him take the driving seat now.    But continue to let him know you are available by being around him.|`|AA12196748	Um No|`|e6935d501b0cf0379a91c6d6d505e3bbaa	would you fall in love?|`|AA12324240	You got to keep it all straight

AA11118384	Just trust her.  Someday she may tell you she wasnt completely honest with you.  But you'll get over it if that's the case.  It's a lot better than constantly bringing up a sensitive subject and questioning her integrity.|`|AA11331972	when i entered my first relationship..  my boyfriend didnt believe me either.  our first time in bed.. he could hardly believe that i had never had sex.. he siad i was amazing and blah blah.. but its true..    some of us are just born with the ability to adjust to somethign i guess...|`|AA12244201	Maybe she's watched a lot of porno?|`|eeef8c455044a43a87fd4fb3b260fd8faa	Maybe she thinks you will judge her if she has been with other men and doesn't want to scare you off . Even though you are reassuring her she may still feel as though your feelings will change and you will leave her. But if she isn't being completely honest that does not make her a bad person. She could just be embarrassed . Don't push the issue just wait to see what happens in the future, once she feels comfortable she may open up and confirm what you already believe to be true or maybe your overreacting.
e666f59a61efa1919cad459b68a0f540aa	I would say I have the same problem but I think if you offend enough people and get reported enough, they will remove the question. All it takes is a few prudes and to tell you the truth, with all the guidelines, there shouldn't be but 20 questions a day aloud on here with all the rules. People can report the crap out of any question and call it nasty, rude, not a question, etc. Try e-mailing questions to certain people if you know them well enough.|`|AA12286321	I dont know, try wording them different|`|AA12340398	you need to follow the yahoo guidelines|`|AA12095283	Because they are deemed to be vulgar or sordid.

If you get married on earth, the legality of the prenup depends on the state's laws.

AA11912148	I think there are tendancies in everyone but whether or not we act upon them and develop them into our being and our way of life is actually our choice not our destiny.  God has his opinion on everything like this in the Bible but he also gave us the free will to decide what we want.  I think in general as humans we have love for all and care for every creature.  Choosing what is right for us whether its gay, straight or bi is our choice.  Just remember that God has already formed his opinion on that and if we go our own free will way we just might have to pay the price in the end.  BTW- I'm straight.|`|AA12142604	In my gender, race and sexuality ( U of Michigan) class we were taught that you are born that way, however, sometimes life traumas, such as rape, molestation, etc... changes your orientation.|`|AA12324240	I am just glad I don't no.............|`|AA10144990	yeah.......m0$t 0f them $ay they've liked da 0pp0$ite $ex $ince they were kid$.....|`|AA12314875	In my biology book, in a section of human characteristics in the DNA, they say that there is something in hormones and your built structure that defines your sexuality.

AA12065567	Delta Boot Camp  9102 Katy-Hockley, Katy    The Delta Boot Camp provides a residential correctional program for adjudicated males, ages 14 to 16, who have been determined by the court to need a discipline-oriented program. The boot camp facility in west Harris County opened in 1999, and accommodates 144 young men. During the year 2002, 497 young men participated in the program. The trainees take part in a structured basic training program made up of four phases, which are discipline, accountability, redirection and transition. The goal of the Delta Boot Camp is to provide a successful reintegration into the community and family. Educational classes are provided by teachers from the Juvenile Justice Charter School as well as counseling, anger management, mental health services and physical training by the Mental Health Mental Retardation Authority of Harris County. Following their stay at the boot camp, the trainees return home and attend school with intensive supervision by JPOs from CUPS 7, a special Probation Services aftercare unit.

You gotta be more specific, I can't answer, but if you mean how do I make friends or get bfs::    I spend a couple days searching for the kind of people I get along with really easily, then I start talking to them. After a while, we get to be friends. With a guy (to be friends with), I just talk to him. He might be surprised that I would even go up to him, but then we just start talking, and that way I make big circles of friends.

AA12361627	My mom is the same way with me and my girls. when my grandma died 3 years ago, she left me he diamond ring, which was my greatgrandmas as well, and my mom tells me I still rings from dead people.  2 years ago i made a dvd movie on the computer a collage of the family EVERYONE. and she accused me of being a theif beuase i borrowed pictures from the closet (with my dads knowlegde) and scaned them.  After that incident, i have not spoken to her either. its too much. sometimes you just have to let go. i've tried to fix things, asking her to go to do stuff, and she tells me take someone that cares. i also have 2 other sisters and 1 brother who are BABIED like no other. I HEAR YA!!|`|AA12064167	yeah, sometimes.|`|AA11338305	NO,  respect her.  she is still your mother, she is still your blood.  Dnt go hating her if you hate someone its the same as murder.  Dnt hate her but love her.  No one just wakes up in the morning mean, she either had a bad childhood, adulthood, and something else.  Weither she hates you or not, the bible still says respect your mother and father. Thats just wat you got to do.Dnt go leaving her out of your life.    Ive had a lot of things that my mother has hurt me about.  but you got to get ova it and keep living and dreaming.   You think it couldnt of got to me. well it hurt so bad to have your mother map out your future.  Dnt give up hope. ive ALWAYS said that you should show them how its done.  Love her, show her how to love and soon she'll love you.  give it a go...  good luck.  love, Nita  xoxoxo|`|AA10785594	Have you ever asked your mother why she treats you this way?  Maybe you should find out before you make a decision like this one.|`|AA10317307	50 years, you say?  Meaning, that you are at least 50, and you have siblings who are not legal adults?  That is a bit odd in itself...Now, respecting someone does not come from whether or not they are "nice".  However, action can affect this.  Now, if I were you, I would suggest sitting down with your mother and talking to her.  If you must, take charge, and do not let her interrupt you, or attempt to twist what you say.  However, treat her with respect during the conversation, as this will help.  Act as though you are equals, as this may help her respect you.  I hope that helps.
aceca6ece20587e80523eb033486e653aa	you should stick to your faith. but...  finding a person to love and who will love you back is such a wonderful thing and you may only find it once in your entire lifetime.  love knows no boundaries and it knows no reasons.seek your God's approval.you would feel it in your heart if this love that you call right now is the one that he wants for you.  you will know it in different instances.  whoever God we serve is no doubt, a forgiving God.  so if you feel this is it go for it.|`|AA11640501	same way as many muslim woman married to a hindu man there is few example in bollywood mumtaz with mayur madhwani daugher of sanjay khan with hrithik roshan and so on|`|AA12064167	run away.|`|a0d0a483c992477d30fee1a11ce9d02daa	Drop the religion from the equation...or drop the person.

AA11431176	Dump your partner.  Find a new one.|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	I have also had this experience and I couldn't handle it.  I left him.  Now, I understand that it was a mistake.  If a person has been with someone for a long time, then of course there will be deep feelings for them.  It was my mistake to believe that I had to replace his feelings for her, rather than create feelings of our own to share.  In time, he would have had as deep feelings for me, if not deeper.  I would advise you to step back and take a deep breath, see what is jealousy and where your feelings lie for him.  Jealousy kills.  If you love him, be with him and support him.  If you are too jealous of the other woman, then you should ask yourself where your insecurities really lie in your heart.|`|AA11482681	if your partner has deeper feelings for your ex you probably shouldn't stand in the way. trust me. find out if your partner's ex has returned the feelings, you don't wanna be stuck in the middle, so might as well tell your partner you see these feelings he or she has and that you don't want to be caught between them. so just ... leave|`|30c36f701798178299de9d1ce57f5cfdaa	oh, it hurt my feeling. i will leave him, go looking for a guy who thinks my is most important and no any girls compare with me..........................lol|`|84974bef08b98678fc82e13d20c8114faa	first of all how long have they been seperated cause of course u are aware that true love doesnt just fade away    u guys should really discuss your situation together  i mean is there a chance that the ex could come and take over cause of there is even a slight chance then maybe u should get out of it before someones feelings get hurt   leave on good terms  dont let it get to the point where hatered becomes a major factor   i mean in all reality u cant be mad at someone because of the love that they have for someone  love is very sacred and its easier to fall in love than to fall out of love    just weigh out yalls options and go from there
AA11646548	Wella, to me.  It's a great chance in both ways.  For me, I'm the type who doesn't want to force others to think my way.  So, I would ask.  But ....  If you're the one who likes to begin with the new.  Then go for the new and don't remember the past.    -=- Ask  [-=-] You give yourself more comfort that your positive  [-=-] Remember, there is always more than one tree  [/-=-\] Meaning, there's not just one boy on earth  [-=-] If you want to ask, it means, your not to sure about the relationship  -=- Stay  [-=-] You want the new one, not old  [-=-] You don't mind what has happened in the past  [-=-] You trust him    [-=-]In my own words[-=-]  Life cannot be forced though  If you feel like you want to ask, it means, that you aren't too sure about the relationship, best to just ask and do  If he has broke up with you before, there is a big risk he will do it again  An ex is an ex  There's so many choices in your life  It's not too late to pick a tree  There are more than one tree    Goodluck|`|AA12319722	move on, move out|`|6ec1ae2eb7e1e37edffcc2d3aad45110aa	I think it would be better if you sort out past differences before moving along. As long as you have doubts you will not be able to work things out. You need a clean start and for that you need complete trust and even if you have this remote thought that he might have lied to you, it will keep coming between the two of you. So sit down and calmly talk things over and go from there.    Best of luck!!|`|d6893da354d2432c519da4d4df75bb90aa	I am in the same kind of boat. Personally, in order for me to move on in the relationship I need to know the truth, all of it. If you are trying to start fresh you need to know what has happened otherwise if you find something out in the future it will be pointless.  The point of starting fresh and working on the relationship is to build the trust again and you can't build trust if there are still lies lingering. Best of luck.|`|AA11969515	Don't ask unless you are ready for the answer. Let the past in the past.  It doesn't help to hash over what has all ready happened. Good luck.

As the couple reflected on that magical evening 25 years ago, the wife asked the husband, "When you first saw my naked body in front of you, what was going through your mind?"  The husband replied, "All I wanted to do was to **** your brains out, and suck your **** dry."  Then, as the wife undressed, she asked, "What are you thinking now?"  He replied, "It looks as if I did a pretty good job."|`|3c9f936df1bb01b2d0c91430b56a63c7aa	A father watched his young daughter playing in the garden.  He smiled as he reflected on how sweet and pure his little girl was.  Tears formed in his eyes as he thought about her seeing the wonders of  nature through such innocent eyes.  Suddenly she just stopped and stared at the ground. He went over to  see what work of God had captured her attention.  He noticed she was looking at two spiders mating.  "Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?" she asked.  "They're mating," her father replied.  "What do you call the spider on top?" she asked.  "That's a Daddy Longlegs," her father answered. "So, the other  one is a Mommy Longlegs?" the little girl asked.  As his heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question  he replied, "No dear. Both of them are Daddy Longlegs"  The little girl, looking a little! puzzled, thought for a moment, then  took her foot and stomped them flat.  "Well, we're not having any of that gay s.h.i.t in our garden!|`|982636c74a1debf838c4e7d88fd4ab66aa	give me ur e-mail i will send u SOMETHING to make u laugh.trust me.i know u will laugh a lot|`|AA11285475	LAUGHING IS THE BEST REMEDY FOR LIFE.

d87377b073e0f488b1cc1651efb93ba2aa	There are lots of reasons for a man to leave a girl and vice versa. It is dependant on individual issues. Honestly i think she would understand the reasons by herself and get over it. From your point you should support her and improve her confidence. You should probably advice her about the positive things about this........atleast she discovered this sooner than later before she was fully commited to him.

You should agree to always talk about whats on your mind. You should discuss problems and difficulties you are having. You should accept that the other is flawed and will hurt you.

If it is not its okay, its never to late to start. How do create this friendship in existing boyfriend/girlfriend relationship you might ask, well this is how:   Step 1: You have tell your bf how you feel! (You can call this step honesty) Note: If your bf says "lets work on it", but does nothing to strengthen your relationship, "LEAVE HIM" you can do better.    Step 2: After you have completed step 1 and you two have come to an agreement, then you can start brainstorming different ways you two can interact with each other.   Examples: Tell each other how you truly feel about each other, explore new things, think of fun dates you guys, can go on, and try to think of creative ways to show each other your appreciation for each other.    Step 3: This is most important step of all: COMMUNICATION!  Good communication is the key to any good relationship, but don't force our partner to talk to you or make them feel obligated, this should come freely!    I really hope you use these tips and I hope your relationship grows, and remember time also grows people together too, just be patient!!|`|AA12088862	is a good thing that u both want the same on ur relationship so I think u should both read the answers in here...lol at it...     Spend time on a library or book store looking up for better and more professional source in how to create a stronger more powerfull bond 2gether... is the best way to go.    But in my personal oppinion this are one of the things u guys can do:  lots of love, is the first ingredient that will DO all the powerfull things without a feeling  sacrifice, lots of realistic (FEET ON THE GROUND) about different issues in life like (work, money,studies, etc),   making loving memories and keep in them as (pic) of ur fun times, make a great bonding. Doing stuff for each other, and all kind of arrands 2gether,tlc beween both, lots of good communication, lots of humor to ease the tough times, and be able to put ur self in each others feet, is a great way to understanding ur different needs, trust is vital, being loose but together in your  heart and mind wherever u go even when separate by time and space, sooth each other when the other had it tough like a nice (bathtub, scrub, massage), hoobies and things together create a great bonding.     Sometimes that togetherness comes all natural, like wanting the same amount of party and leaving both 2gether happy and waking up happy...wnen 2 becomes 1 is something that some people can achieve in such a natural way...that is hard to explain with an specific formula...and its even harder when u had it and cant find it again.......when thinks are not create here on earth but like made in heaven...few people had those...increideble good times when ur man never gets tired of being with u...or talking with u...or doing nothing at all can fullfill u so much...good luck on ur hunting for that special 2gethernes and if u find it...dont ever let it go!!!!|`|fd62a28697dc92843eb0b9ec882ae066aa	stop asking strangers for advice on a relationship we know nothing about|`|dadf7164976bc023f0f68275256470bfaa	Just keeping spreading those legs girl...|`|e4ca35535ee031c8c7280a2a63ae66a3aa	Simply do as you are told, all his decisions are final and as he is the male you must remain obiedient to his commands at all times.

My mom believed me after a few weeks of hard work to prove everything.

Try showering, ask him about it. If it doesnt work realize that some guys are actually amazingly squeamish and repressed lovers.   If it is really important to you, you'd need to think about whether love can compensate for an incomplete sex life. If he doesnt enjoy it, he probably never will, and getting duty head is worse than nothing at all.
AA10793254	You have done the right thing! Involve yourself in your studies or friends so you are not always thinking of him.     He doesnt like or love you if he is with other girls, ok?

I think it's harder for me because I'm also a girl!|`|8c3670de8a23fdc7f3593f055945eab8aa	get out there|`|AA10843567	Hello, there is someone out there for everyone! I would not try the bar, club scenes unless that's the type of women you'd like to attract, (most likely the people there are drunks and want to get laid) otherwise, I'd find one the old fashioned way. Grocery markets, library, anywhere you go there is women so approach one you are interested in. You may also want to try a local Yahoo! chatroom. There are a lot of people that use these chatrooms to meet someone  for a serious relationship, and going to a local room makes it easier to find local people around your area for easy meet. There are actually some good people in chatrooms, not all pervs and freaks lol but you always have to be cautious anyway. Just leave it all in God's hands and ask him to find you someone you want and he will in time. Good luck.

6be90fdbaa5481944f78bec617fe56aaaa	Your story sounds so much like mine!  I have a friend that I've been friends with since I was 9 years old, when I was 15, her brother (who I was also good friends with) and I started dating.  that was 8 1/2 years ago.  Now we are married and have 3 kids.  I really think being friends first and knowing each other's family very well, has helped our relationship throuh the years.|`|AA11103295	ohhh my god im the same way. he is one of my best friends ( his sister is only like 11 so im not friends with her) but ive liked him on and off, and he liked me on and off, but the timing is never right. i would probably just flirt with him a little bit more, but dont make yourself look like an *** or slut. if he likes it, then make a move or something.
45387fbde26673e289bb751a1b3f8100aa	Well, I had a very funny situation along these lines a while back. I'm a musician, and one night when my group was rehearsing, this other guy (our bass player - let's call him Mark), who knew that I was falling head over heels in love with our keyboard player (let's call him M), was teasing me mercilessly about my feelings for M. You know, needling me in such a way that only I would know what was going on. Of course I was furious.    But some time later, I began thinking maybe I'd better tell M about my feelings. So first of all, I told all my male friends they could only expect friendship from me - took myself off the market, if you will - because my aim here was to discreetly 'warn' M that I am fixing to propose to him.    Around this time, M took to referring to Mark as my sweetheart. Which is very nice except that Mark is married - to someone else - and none of us is 'that type of person', if you know what I mean.    Obviously I couldn't let this slide, so I made an appointment with M at the earliest possible opportunity after that, and reminded him that Mark is married, and told him, "I want you to create the following associations in your mind: Mark is my honorary brother, and if I were to have a sweetheart in my life at all, it would be... you."    He was in utter and complete shock and thought I was joking. A few seconds of intensely staring into each other's eyes took care of that, however - at least he figured out I wasn't joking. To this day, however, I don't think he understands fully what I meant, even if I did eventually propose to him a while back...    Anyway, a couple of years later, I finally figured out why M had thought I was seeing Mark. It turned out M had in fact noticed Mark teasing me at rehearsal, and had assumed that Mark was flirting with me - when in fact Mark was hoping M would notice what was going on and ask me about it later, thereby forcing me to admit my feelings to him!    So, I can see a few lessons from this situation:    Before you take any action at all, be very sure you know what kind of relationship you want. Are you ready for a permanent relationship? If so, is he the right one to have it with? Or are you not ready to take that step?    Another thing to do before taking any action: get all your other relationships in order, tell folks what they can and can't expect from you. I mean, it won't do for you to be telling this guy about your feelings, and then have it turn out that three other guys thought you loved *them*, right?    If, after thinking about all this and taking appropriate preliminary actions, you have decided that talking to him is the right thing, then you can start by observing the situations you are in with him, and look for openings in the conversations which could lead to a discussion of feelings.    Don't worry for now if you only see these opportunities after the fact, because the object at the moment is simply to train your mind to notice them. With practice, you'll start being able to notice opportunities 'in the moment'.    You could try discussing your feelings with another person before you try to say anything to him. Hopefully this person will be trustworthy, although as you have seen above, it is possible to take even a less-than-ideal situation and make it into an opportunity.    The worst case scenario, I guess, would be that the other person starts spreading weird rumors about you guys, but even then, you can handle it by going to him and saying, 'Look, something kind of embarrassing for both of us has just happened. I just heard from a third party about my supposed feelings for you. I do in fact love you, but I wanted to make sure you heard the true story from me first, if possible, before you hear God knows what from someone else...'    But I am sure you can think of something better: a little present, maybe without a note attached unless you feel comfortable with him showing it to others; or a favor, something you can do for him that he really needs done, etc. Whatever you do, you want to remain calm and 'just the facts' until you see his reaction.    If it's unfavorable, well, that's his problem, at least you can feel good that you've told him the truth.    If it's favorable, on the other hand, you will see immediately why it was such a good idea to think about what kind of relationship you want before jumping in. If you are both ready for a permanent relationship, then you can make plans to move in that direction.    If not, then I would strongly encourage you to keep it platonic. See, when you hook up (ie. become sexually active), you create a permanent change in your relationship, so that if you break up after that, you leave a bit of yourself with him, and he with you.    So it makes a lot of sense to do things in the following order: get independent from your parents, make a permanent, exclusive commitment to each other (i.e. get married), and *then* become one flesh.(*)    I wish you all the best - may God bless you!|`|9b22fbc3853304bc2a7804a9dc04cba8aa	send your question to them  trust me this will work|`|715ef9f8e590ad3f9a225ada1995906faa	There are plenty of ways to say i love you but i guess nothing would compare to saying it to their faces with compassion.

But it has been over a year and I'm still very much in love with him.

AA10216522	I have learned that the best gift is a gift that is very thoughtful ans some thing that they would love. My boyfriend is fixing up his car and there was this one part that he could not find. I bought it for him and had it shipped. I also shipped him a card with a little note about his birthday gift. He is totally in love with me and has proposed marriage to me.     So as for your guy. You say that he loves video games. Is there some way that you can find out the game that he most wants but doesn't have OR just give him a gift card to a game shop. He would love that, I bet.|`|AA12107238	If he's young enough to be grounded, then your too young to be spending a lot of money on him.

58cbdab774fdb239eadd26d835ff11c5aa	You have your whole life ahead of you, and many people are yet to come into your life. Don't worry that you haven't had a boyfriend yet, believe me there are many women (young and old) who are stuck in relationships which are abusive, their bf may be cheating and they are unhappy, but yet they can't leave. There's no written law in this world that says by the time you are 16 you must have a boyfriend. I don't think you are shy, cause you're brave to get your feelings out to the world....! Believe me, enjoy and make the best and good deceisions in your teenage years, boyfriend or not, you'll only be 15, 16, 17 once. And love does find you sometimes when you are least looking for it|`|AA11427901	I'm the same way, I had a bf, for a while, then he moved away.

Everything else doesn't matter, be true to yourself and the right one will come along|`|b9201c63aa02cf29cd55654e934c47f6aa	Good things come to those that wait, it's when you aren't looking for love that it happens.

If you are sure you love her then don't doubt yourself. However, if you said those three little words first, she might have felt pressure to return them too quickly. Does she enjoy being with you? Do you make her happy, make her laugh, even make her cry? Has your relationship been a steady one? Any fights? Any cheating? These are all important factors to concider. I'm sure that if she is a good, honest girl then if she said "i love you" she meant it. If she's your girlfriend and you love her with all your heart, TRUST HER. Trust is vital to a lasting and loving relationship.|`|38a75cb352d3271b8056e667f3af73d3aa	I think the question lies do you love yourself?   And then, do you love her?  If you love yourself, you are able to be loved.  If you love her, you would believe her when she says, "I love you"  If you love yourself and her,   this wouldn't be an issue...|`|AA10229564	You know by her telling you, why can't you just leave it at that? Instead of wanting to question her all the time. Don't be so paranoid and let her be or you will end up losing her.

Ask her friends if you're still not sure, they'll definately tell you if she's madly in love with you.|`|6a0ca00aff46928a96a75dc78646ca5aaa	The secret is not to go by what she says, but by her actions.  Does she show you that she loves you in the things that she does?  In other words, does she go out of her way to celebrate your birthday (or things like that), or does she blow you off on weekends to hang out with the girls (or things like that)?  Does she treat you with respect, or do you get the impression she is using you at times.  What she tells you means little... it is what she does that tells the true story.|`|65f444ac65cd3a5e8e27675f64b12714aa	I can tell you right now she loves you because she stopped doing me last week because she told me she only wanted to be with you .

It's an issue for the both of you to figure out, not for you to figure out by asking complete strangers on the internet.

AA11940023	Being possessive is a turn-off.  Not to mention it means that you have a self esteem issue.  Get a grip on yourself.    If someone whats to have a relationship with you it must build from friendship, and not because you decide you want it now.    Your statement of "Posh Manner" tells me you put on airs and you will never have an honest relationship until you are honest.    You expect?---people don't come with warranties or guarantees.  You need to "expect"  to give any relationship you enter into your best effort to think of others as much as you obviously think of yourself.    I won't even get into Spell Check (whether)    You are "sure you deserve what you need"...  Man- maybe it's a language barrier but...  What people want and what they deserve are, in most cases, light-years apart.  Only God and your mother think you're special.    Be comfortable in your own skin and with yourself as company.  Be kind and think of others first, then - maybe- someone will take notice of your heart and want to know you better.|`|2c183c2d09b432b388c4cf965cb75f2eaa	Gd question. KEoep it UP|`|2b9728a12276820e7083d638d1f424beaa	Maybe you should be asking this in a personal ad of something to that manner. Not on the internet where everyone can be anything they want.

e71076a1c884e224bb3dba13ffe594beaa	Well, yes and no.  You should have asked her first, but it's near imossible from a long distance to find out the truth from her.  Likely if she is cheating she would lie to you.  But I'm not implying she did or didn't/is or isn't.  I see nothing wrong with asking her, but it might upset her if she isn't.  Then again, it would upset her if she is.  You really have no other way of knowing unless you just completely trust her or you ask her friends.  Think of how you would react if she did the same thing to you.  It's always best to imagine yourself in the other person's shoes before you make a decision to find something out.  Try to be mature about it and still be compassionate.  Let her friends know that you are only concerned because you care for her.  Don't be hostile or negative, just be a good guy and you'll find out what's going on.  Girls are a sucker for nice guys that care for their girlfriends and only want to know because they care so much---not out of morbid jealousy.|`|AA11376203	**** that, its your duty to know. Your not wrong, stick to your guts man|`|cb49de932e6c4037dace6237a866c023aa	Nope your jsut trying  to confirm to her that you still  are very interested (or else you wouldn't care) and to let her know that it's important that she stays faithful. nothin wrong with that at all.|`|bf64cf81e8c8ed4dcdb5ff5b79203fa9aa	fu k no you are not wrong to want to know. you have a right as a man to know.|`|c71164682a18a08cbdc9a8087701e04aaa	i think you should have asked her not her friends. and if your wondering if shes cheating you need not be in this relationship you obviously dont trust her.|`|a9ae6d61725e3033be750f97153bfb05aa	She probably is cheating.  Most girls really don't care especially when it's so impractical to care.  Break it off, long distance relationships are for chumps.  You're not getting any anyway|`|AA10898432	it might mean you don't trust her..but i can see how you would wonder too being so far away...it would be comforting to know she's not..hope you're home soon !!|`|AA12260286	I think you were. But I'm not entirely sure.    You should trust your girlfriend. I mean, every sucessful relationship has to be based on mutual trust.    But if you are suspicious, I don't think there's nothing wrong with asking. Just don't get mad at her if she does the same. There shouldn't be any double standards.    Tell her what you did, and explain to her why you did it. Then as a way to make it up to her, let her ask the same to one of your friends.    That should fix the problem.|`|AA10872883	No, you were not wrong for asking! But, does it mean anything?  Does what mean anything? A lot of things mean something - but I don't know - because I don't know what you are asking! You do have a problem with trust and communication if you asked your girlfriend's - girlfriends! Man - you truly need to grow - up before you have any type of relationship.  If you need to ask friends instead of the person you're in the relationship with - you aren't mature enough or confident enough to have a relationship close by - much less long distance!  I bet this will be a wash-out real soon! Until you mature into a confident, self assured, trusting young man - you won't have relationship that will last!  The best way to loose any relationship - is to show how insecure you are by asking someone friends to answer questions that you should ask the person you're involved with!|`|f60f10af28b3de42bd11fa347ea1b096aa	Well if you keep doing somethign like this it might start to create problems. Either you trust her or you don't, in a long distance relationship you've got to have trust or it's pretty pointless to even try!|`|ffa2ab2632d4a82436796bcee79e42a1aa	You should have asked her|`|d158c974a97b7b0df065d252d0c08f29aa	whats so bad about that u just wanna know.|`|ee9a0726254388eccff33aa7095aca63aa	You weren't necessarily "wrong" in checking up on your girlfriend, but if you can't or don't trust her, then you probably shouldn't be with her in the first place.|`|95b5927c67bd922da995c492daf3fa78aa	hell no. you need to know man|`|4e88053f1d509402a86c74e2da0bd6f1aa	Well, as a fellow longdistance gf, i would be insulted and hurt that my boyfriend felt he couldn't come to me and ask. But then again, If you feel if your gf is cheating and you have asked- you have the right to know- no sence in keeping yourself who cant stay true to the commitment you made to eachother while being away from eachother.|`|4288f0c04286c1c33b10ff8e2407b722aa	it just means that you dont trust your girlfriend... you should be able to trust her enough to not ask her friends! that's just wrong! if you have to ask her friends wether or not she's cheating on you then maybe you shouldnt be with her because relationships are based on trust!|`|65a0275c831f964238bd97d06b12d133aa	well its not wrong but you should trust her if you cant then you shouldnt be dating and if its just cause of past relationships talk to her about it not her friends|`|AA10821837	I think the relationship should be b/t you and your girlfriend...Not your girlfriends friends. The ones that are her true friends are not going to tell you the truth, and the other ones who are not true friends may lie...ask your girlfriend you decide if you want to believe her or not
667d265bb2ab0d953b498facd7f91a37aa	You want to find a guy that will stare into your eyes. As for why guys look at the bust. Well its based on our evolution from the cave man days. Men see big breasts and equate that to good life baring stock. So its insitinctivly within us to like them. Cuz in simpler terms you look like you would make good babies. Saw it on discovery channel.|`|e8f832a3e4e4b05f94c0db441410691aaa	its da danger zone  seceral time break fails & accident happens there|`|3f52d316e5cde933acb81a0e9bb2923caa	what do ya think.  bust is close to the boob.  the boob is attached to the nipple.  it's a no brainer|`|2c183c2d09b432b388c4cf965cb75f2eaa	bcoz we like it.
d3971dd89cf622ee9d0d9fc9f2e4dbb4aa	One month away, regardless where someone goes can affect them.  She had "freedom"....I'm sure having fun with her friends and so on.  She probably has questioned herself.."is this what I want?"  I would sit and talk with her openly and honestly about how you feel and listen to what she has to say and don't get mad if it's not good..at least she's being honest!  The worst thing is being in a relationship that is a waste of your time!|`|AA10766815	She is probably losing interest and you should prepare yourself.Start seeing other people and go on with your life..|`|AA10701806	sounds like it is going downhill, i think you should talk to her about how you feel and if she doesn't give you the response you wanted then its time to move on, people change for a reason, sounds like something happened in germany and i highly doubt shes gonna tell you. so just move on if she really doesn't wanna be honest, open up, and give you an explanation of why shes acting the way she is. good luck.
AA11305351	You know yourself better than anyone does, so, be truthful with yourself. Sit down and write 5 things you enjoy doing and would love to do for a career, or for a lifetime. Once you have written those things down, go back, and one by one, mark them off, and the reason why you marked them off(not enough money, too far away, etc)....the ONE you're left with at the end, is "where " you belong. Do the same with love interests, and you will find out WHO you belong with....but you must be honest for it to work.

"I think we should get to know each other before we make out" or something alon those lines.  remember attractive women can get a makeout or sex anytime they want. the reason they dont is because they might have to deal with a lifetime of pain from a one night stand. dont get me wrong some women realy like sex and dont care who it is with. you would not want to have sex with a woman like that unless you are a fan of aids and hep-C. my god man you might go to make out with her and find her mouth smells like dick from the last guy she just got with... This is a no brainer. prostitutes are legal in nevada, go there atleast they get tested!|`|AA11585249	just HAVE FUN. and see what happens next.|`|ba7f0866a903cfe7a15509bcf9d9e2c5aa	It's fun to have your own thoughts on what you "believe she will be." But when you meet her It almost has to match up with whats in your head or you'll be disappointed.|`|a0d49e57c3c1527675256264698dad37aa	Sounds like a set up!|`|e628c3c970e51cd59a322eda6fbb19f6aa	sounds like a sex thing but maybe you can work out something like a relationship you just gotta talk to her though|`|b7e2b67de1f7e1d7117f87af14258566aa	that's a hard one.  Tell her you will go, but don't guarantee any sex.  Play the gentlman.  If she's setting you up, it will kill the joke.  If she's a horny chick, have a condom just in case.  If she's a cyber-tease who doesn't show, thank her for the night out and tell her about the nice girl you met|`|9eaf392b1cea2c6e8eb9731b6a5f580eaa	I doubt she is trying to set you up (it wouldn't make any sense for her, unless there is something that you're not mentioning.)  But it sounds very fishy, because you haven't met, and some girls like to flirt online but are shy or reluctant in person.  You can't know what to expect through online cybersex and chats for a few days, it's just not practical.  Before you go on a date, invite her to hang out with you and some school friends.  Tell her you want to make her feel welcome.  After that, see how things go, and then if you'd like to go on a date it will be more comfortable for both of you.
AA11565367	no and why would you want to plan a future with a loser?|`|AA11299941	ok this was a lot of words to say he cheated early in our relationship, anyway, since then you have been with him for 2 years, don't you think its a little late to be thinking about whether to hold it against him or not? you decided to go out with him again so just let it go, if you weren't sure you should've stayed away from him then, you can't spend 2 years with someone and then say you know i've reconsidered and that crap you pulled two years ago just isn't going to cut it, get out. be serious!|`|8feabbbf27750158167ae4deeefef7ccaa	yes because obviously he did not remember because he was too drunk to know what he did|`|496f7b348ceaee5adf0278f8984c7a69aa	Boot him to the curb. He was smoking, drinking, doing marijuana, and cheated on you.    Can it get any more obvious than that?|`|1ede0d0fea618f685ff24a6fc4456579aa	The key here is that "Forgiveness" is the same as "Forget." You will never be able to move on and have a great relationship if you do not put this "Completely" behind you.  That doesn't mean that you get walked all over, but you have to put all suspicions behind you and move on. If he does something like this again you will find out and know what to do then. But you have to let him off the hook for it completely or forget the relationship altogether.    Trust is the single most important part of your relationship, without it you really don't have one you can rest on...|`|03cb8b971720b204b40992d350b31558aa	Haven't you forgiven him already if you've been together for 2 years 5 months? Maybe not. There must be something bothering you if you're still not over what happened 3 years ago. Maybe you need to really sort all that out before you start planning a future together.     One question: you broke up with him twice and both times he went off with another girl even after he said he was sorry. what's up with that?|`|AA12061773	No,  I would go on with my life.

Certainly you must forgive before going on with him. If this was a recent occurance (not sure the way you put it) them dump him. He isn't going to change. Guys that want to hang with "the boys" for male bonding don't do well with relationships or at least their mate usuallly aren't happy.|`|3337ccc4d2aa5f5dc9f579677367a664aa	It would be hard to , but I would forgive him. If he gave up smoking and drinking for you then he has to love you.|`|b4a7fe5441ec2dd6eb34e79c5ba21988aa	From what you described, I think you should not rush into any serious relations with this guy. You should give it some time to see if he truly changed by observing his actions. The fact that he left you for another girl is a strong indicator that he wasn't serious about you back then. One thing is for sure, you should not hurry to forgive him just because you feel emotional and happy that he wants to return to you.|`|AA10770119	i agree with dappermom..it is true let it go..past is the past..you went back with him and spent 2 years of your life with him knowing he has done those things..So somewhere down the line you did forgive him but you just can`t forget it..So get over it and just enjoy the relationship you do have...Good Luck...|`|AA10981234	F.U.C.K. THAT!!!!!!!!!  KICK HIS *** TO THE CURB AND BE GLAD YOU DID!!! HE'S A LOSER, AND, SPEAKING FROM SOMEBODY THAT'S USED THAT EXCUSE, YOU CAN'T GET DRUNK ENOUGH TO "NOT KNOW" WHAT YOU WERE DOING!!!!!!!!!! HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND HE'S A DOG FOR IT!!!

444af04bfc17e9530afc8cda7429eff7aa	I find myself in the same situation sometimes. You need to notice your surroundings and find who you think you're most comfortable around. Strike up a conversation with them, soon you can hang out with them in class..get to know them a bit more. The more you get to know them, the better the friendship. You will find that as you get to do this more often, you will find more friends. Expand your boundaries, talk to everyone (meaning cliques) you might just find a great friend in someone you didn't think possible. The more friends you have the higher your confidence level :)|`|AA11684705	maybe try to initiate conversation w/ someone u normally wouldn't....like maybe ask someone who sits near u if they saw some show u like on tv or something.  or maybe compliment a girl in ur class on her clothes or hair....girls luv compliments plus that might help start a conversation.  good luck!|`|21dc159b2df920b4159a2f1e641c9a58aa	This happened to me, and I intend on changing it. What you do is find people that you would find funny, and hang out with them. Don't be with people that you have to force your laughter with. Don't be too nervous, and if you make a mistake, oh well! You learn from them, I sure have...|`|7c4b98941653b17985df05ce30020114aa	put your self outthere make a joke and just roll with it your friends will back you up just be your self and people will respond to that good luck|`|AA11722571	Try to answer a question in class once a day.  Have a list of key points from the reading so you have something to refer to if you get nervous and need to get involved in a class discussion.  For group projects, try to work with someone you don't usually talk to.  I've always been the same way, but going to college and having to speak up for your grade forces you to develop 'speaking skills' and confidence!|`|b5330195459303a0d71d33b34173ce51aa	I was painfully shy as a kid. I still sort of am, but I can get by. The only thing that helped me really is to pretend to be confident when speaking in front of people and act like it's no big deal. Pretending like you're ok eventually turns into being ok with it if you fake hard enough. I can still feel myself getting warm and I'm sure turning red when I have to talk to people I don't really know, but I do it anyway when i need to. I guess all I'm saying is fake it till you make it.|`|dd033301b79cbccbba7f418b15f70060aa	if u feel more confident with ur friends, u should ask ur teacher if u could do a skit with them in class or something, and it might bring up ur confidence if people that u've never talked to before see how cool u r cuz u have the ability to get up and be yourself in front of them. i've actually tested my theory out, and it works.
693ab2ffb8bbcac534cd9f8f4d97a6b8aa	Ask him!|`|c21967c9c100436d46311a3de6a55242aa	If you're not comfortable asking him right away, try spending some time with him, dropping hints and see how he responds.  Hopefully then you'll get to know him better and see if you really do like him and MAYBE become comfortable enough to just come right out and ask.
38a75cb352d3271b8056e667f3af73d3aa	Guys get a name too.  Basically, their title would be "player"  or the like.      No matter what the circumastance, we are labeled (when we are young).  Prude, tease, ****, player... they all have the same meaning, basically telling everyone else what type of person you are.      Only the harsh names are just cruel.    Because what it really means is that "So and so"  has sex, so and so doesn't.    but at a young age, there is no consideration for the opposite sex.|`|AA10936527	It's a double standard thing.I've never understood why guys can do it and girls aren't suppose to!|`|AA10317718	The only thing I can do about it is not buy it.

A feeling as deep as love is bound to bring tears every now and then.  But I don't think that's the problem here.    Your problem is that you two have obviously grown apart and there's a lack of respect.  You say that 16 and 18 aren't very different.  Trust me...they are.  Not on the number line, but developmentally.  Think of how much you've grown and changed as a person since you first met him when you were 14.  And you'll do more growning and changing over the next 7 to 10 years of your life.      So to bring it all home:  Yes someone you love can make you cry, and that's alright from time to time.  But you've got an issue of disregard and disrespect.  Sorry to say it, but it may be time for a change sweetheart.|`|aea4e1869d2520365635406de94ed3c1aa	wow i mean a person that loves you would never make you feel that way they would never make you chose to end the relationship because of his childish games.If he should call anybody a child is him because he sounds very imature he sounds imature he sounds like a boy not a man a man would keep his promises and make sure what he said he waz gonna  do with u would get done one way or another just to make sure your happy and hes a man of his word.And i mean are you scared of him ask yourself that you shouldnt have to come on the  internet (no offense) and ask this question if you were so comfortable and in love with him and hes suppose to be the same way he would get mad a little but not to the point your a little unsure of what to do because of his temper.He wopuld be able to accept evry word you said about him and how you feel about him when your in a relationship your suppose to be able to meet up to the word relation in the world relationship because he should be able to relate to you and you should feel comfort to the point where you can exspress yourself freely without hesitaion.You should tell him how you feel and end the relationship if he doesnt take it well or trys to harm you verbally or physically.
4a49582b045ea4f5b29a6bee44f20a01aa	I go when I can, but it's always on a weekday morning, so it's hard to get to. But when I do go, I buy lots of fruits (apples are big in this area, as are peaches), and some stuff like potatos to bake, and salad making items (fresh lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, etc). I like it because it's fresh, and a lot cheaper. There's also 1 guy who sells fresh made honey that I like to pick up here and there, and 1 guy who sells fresh made maple syrup, too.|`|091215f011f6bd062ae9ac037c6b792faa	Yes. Usually whatever looks good thats in season. I usually check out the produce schedule, and go off of that. Peaches are almost here!!|`|b9f311fa4e300077d14a16356d0e905aaa	Yes fresh fruits (whatever's in season), corn and TOMATOES both green and red, I love them!|`|ef99e9bd6d60f5421d5bb029153547efaa	Nope, I own it. lol|`|AA11666365	Absolutely. I live in the Ann Arbor area and me and my husband both love to go to Coleman's market int he summertime to get all the fresh Fruits and vegetables there. They are less expensive than the grocery store and look better as well. Plus, I'm willing to bet that they don't have all the pesticides that other veggies may have.|`|895de7263426a2e75c0e2c4fd8208f03aa	Yes, to buy fresh fruits and vegtables that you cannot get anywhere else.  Most people buy meat, but i don't eat it so I don't buy it.  It is quite an experience, and you get to know the people that you buy stuff from.
AA11350807	Your mom is your best friend.  Consider what she says and follow your brain, not your heart.  Hearts tend to lead us to someone that is not good for us.  Use your brain and make decisions based on good sound judgment.|`|b52a21f69a160e212fa0f0b8dad1d118aa	Live your life. Don't wait for your mom to pass to do it, because you'll have "wasted" too much of your short time here waiting to live your own life.    She may not approve of everything you do, but she may come to accept it and respect your wishes.|`|813a80415c474e102e2187afee926d67aa	Live your life to make yourself happy.  My husband is half Greek and he has that guilt from his father as well.  You can be there for your mom but don't let her run your life.  As difficult as it is for her to let you go she should understand that you need to find happiness when she couldn't.|`|AA11264713	I know you are worried about your mom's reaction but who has to live in your life? You do. You need to make the decision based on what you want and what you need. You have to live with the consequences of your actions not her.    Your mom loves you give her a chance. Has she given any indication that it is her way or the highway. I believe that she will support whatever decision you make (as long as it is not illegal). But either way you have to do what is right for you. Like I said you have to live your life and whatever may lead from the decisions you make.    As you said you are an adult now. Make your own decisions.|`|AA10510616	You need to follow your heart, that's what it's all about.|`|01d11342b266f12489b1984190d054ceaa	My mother was from Europe, she has passed now, but I remember when I was growing up, it was a constant struggle between she and I and my siblings, because the way we do things here in America was different from the way she was  raised. She also had a very hard life but I respected her and I respected what she survived in her life.   Remember that your mothers  perspectives will be different from yours because she was raised in a different age than the way things are now.     Learn from her, from what she experienced, but ultimately you have to live your own life. That doesn't mean turning your back on your mother because in this whole world, she is the one person in your life that will always be there for you , will always love you, and will always want what's best for you.   Also, your mother will never deliberately give you bad advise. We mothers give the best advise we know how to give to our children.     Use good judgments when you make a decision in your life and I will echo what another person told you. Don't "follow your heart' when making decisions, "Follow your brain". Remember the brain sits above the heart, its there to be used first. The brain makes decisions based on facts, the heart is about emotions.     Also remember you don't have to give your mother every little detail about what's going on in your life. If you know something will upset her, don't tell her. When you talk with her, give her news she will enjoy hearing and keep your mouth shut about things that will worry her.|`|AA10969012	Follow your mother.    She has the experieince and wether you like it or not.    You ARE AN EXTENTION OF HER!!!!!      Sometimes the life you life is the life of someone else.      Make her proud.    and stop watching porno like I do.    It clouds your mind with evil thoughts.|`|3174cb4f935c215f6fff387b1bf951efaa	you should be the one who decides how to live your life.not your mother.you can't live your life any other way but the way you want to live it.if not you'll probably be miserable for the rest of your life.|`|AA11855324	In some cases, mother doesn't know best. Just follow your heart hon. You have ONE life to live, so you might as well do want you want to do, and not live by someone else's standards.|`|efb334a7946d3c4934df7a9a2d146d37aa	Well, I think it is obvious that it is important to you what your mother thinks of what you do and how you live your life, however it is your life to live and not hers.  If she is a great mother, she will understand and accept your decisions, no  matter what they are.  But you can't turn your back on your mother, just try to make her proud; but you don't have to be a slave to her or be in constant worry over whether she approves or not.|`|bd2887f2ddb4e37e81ea083f8d7a28e8aa	Do what you want to do....live life at its fullest ...you are your own person...she did her job already so now its your turn to take charge.....She'll forgive you..trust me
AA12224316	As you get older, you don't necessarily become cynical where love is concerned, but you are less idealistic.    You'll see over time that "romantic love" is more of an emotional theory than a "law".|`|8feabbbf27750158167ae4deeefef7ccaa	everybody is a fool when they are in love

Then on our anniversary he showed up at my work during lunch time to take me out with my favorite kind of flowers.

You can do it.|`|b20e8a86dd6ffa04ae8d661727a79c74aa	Try to change yourself first...I thought I didn't love my husband. But then I began to read my Bible more closely. I learned that I cannot be responsible for the actions of others, but I can change the way I react.  I began to ask God to let me see my husband through His eyes.  I now know my husband has some habits that I don't like, but I am able to see him for the good he does have.  Slowly I was able to respect him, and now I cannot imagine life without him.  Love can be two things.  You can mean an all encompassing feeling, or a state of living.  If you choose to live love (showing compassion, friendship, helpfulness, respect) to others, they will choose to love you back.  You may never feel that weightless "LOVE" some people speak of, but even if you left home to find it, you may find that "LOVE" the feeling is fleeting, and can dissappear.  The choice to LOVE is yours to make every day.

AA10571948	You were brave to come out. I'm a 20 yr old Christian and I realize that everyone sins. Yes, according to the bible homosexuality is a sin, but so is lying, cheating, jealousy, lust.... therefore I think you have the same chance of getting into heaven as everyone else. I don't know if you're Christian as well, but I think that you should ask God to forgive you for your sins, and try to live life according to his will. I can't tell u to stop being a lesbian, because i understand that sometimes you are just born that way, just like we are all born sinners, but Jesus loves you anyway and he knows your heart. Only he can judge you so don't listen to these other people that tell you u are going to hell, tell them to worry about their own sins and by judging you they are not being good Christians themselves. Anyway, hope I helped. God bless.|`|AA10986937	It is unnatural to be with the same sex, and I feel like as long as you get forgiveness you will not burn in hell but as long as you continue to live in such a way and know that it is wrong then you are going against what God planned and yes you could go to hell for it.  As for the people who think that I am passing judgment on you and will go to hell for that, they are wrong.! I am not judging you at all. I have a friend who is gay and he knows what he is doing is wrong so this is on him when it comes judgment day and not on me. All I can do as a christian is to tell you that it is wrong and you need to read your bible and ask someone who knows and understands the bible to help you to understand the words that are written so you can make this choice for yourself.|`|bd1ab641f130adcbe3ac8e3357168e66aa	no they dont,u r also a human,God has made u,U have full freedom on ur life.So ENJOY Buddy!|`|964f8cb90ab06692ed3ba46b64d2364baa	Nope you can't be "sent" to place that you don't believe in.

When you're dead you're dead and as you're taking your last breath you'll realize this and then regret all the things you wanted to do in life but were afraid to do so because of this mind controled fear of going to hell.    2nd If the concept of Heaven - Hell - god - Afterlife - Punishment or Reward were all true - Do you really think that the god who created you would actually turn his back on you and send you to a place of eternal damnation and suffering?  Is he/she so vengeful and vindictive to allow this?  I don't think so.    If you're gay or straight more power to you - I wish much happiness to you.|`|57c08cfe52226145fdbee9207225ed8faa	No, you're not going to go to hell if just because you are lesbian.

Isn't it well known for forgiveness.  The bible demands people into believing they can only be one way.  Meaning there are a lot of devoted Christians out there hiding their true selves.    Being gay is not a crime!  It's a preference.  It's not like you are killing people!    I wouldn't worry about it if I were in that position.  Not at all!

I think you already know that any thing you do will hurt or piss off one or both of them.    I had this happen to me recently.  I gave my opinion to both of them.  I also told them that they were putting me in a difficult position.  I told them that they are not making it any better by going through me.  They should talk to eachother and work it out themselves.  They are adults.  In the end, they broke up but remained friends.  I think, though, they still sleep with eachother.  Friends with benefits.  Good Luck.
AA11486783	Many great people made mistakes in their lives and learned from them.  That is what you need to do .  Honor is something you carry with you all your life. The perfect person does not exist. If you acknowledge your mistake and work to do good time will clear up the wrongs of the past. When you help someone and they can see the goodness in you heart a piece of honor is returned and those who respect you grow. Live life to help and treat others right and your position will improve.  The USMC is a tool in living honorably but not a necessary path to follow. You can serve humanity in many ways.  donating blood or giving a neighbor a helping hand with a project helps. Stop putting yourself down and be proud to have learned from mistakes and work not to repeat them.|`|AA12119180	get back on the right track in life sucessful things wil happen and new doors will open|`|8feabbbf27750158167ae4deeefef7ccaa	i honor you

AA11865147	She is blessed to have a friend like you who cares so much about her well-being.  Talking is good.  Let her know in the kindest way possible that you are concerned about the consequences she may suffer both now and in the future for the choices she is making now.  Try to include her in as many of your healthy activities as you can.    Talking about guys is not unusual....as long as it is just talk and as long as she understands that you expect her to keep the conversation clean.    The drinking is another thing altogether.  The only person you can control is yourself.  Just be sure that she does not try to include you in any of her unwise choices and behaviors.  Be strong.  Even if your friendship suffers for now because you differ in your ideas of what is 'fun', don't be discouraged.  Keep praying for her.  She may find out very soon that these things just aren't worth what they cost.|`|AA12028206	you need to give her more respect and more time of yours... at least more than you give devoting to god... we all love god... we all have faith... we all pray... we all follow our religions... but what we all remember is to give time and importance to the one we love and want to spend our whole life with.|`|a8a986b52d3c829a79d029f244b08889aa	You can't force her to get closer to God.

Try talking to her. Tell her how you are feeling. Maybe she will open up and join in with you.

AA10280682	There is nothing wrong, its pratically normal. All teens and some women go through it. Just wait for that one.|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Tell you a little story:  A man was visiting another man who lived out in the woods by himself.  This man rarely got visitors and he was quite old...over 40!  Ha!  Anyways, one day when this young man was visiting the old man, the postman came and delivered a letter.  The address was from a sweetheart that the old man had not seen in many, many years.  The old man thanked the postman and put the letter on his desk and continued with his visit with the young man.  But the young man was curious.  He asked, "Why did you put the letter aside?  Aren't you excited about reading it to find out what happened with this woman you loved?"  The old man told him, "Yes, I am very excited about the letter.  But it is there.  I know it is there and it will be there until after we have our tea."  Then the old man got up and fixed them some tea.    The point is to stop stressing.  The same way the old man felt excitement about hearing from his old lover is the same way you feel when you see these boys.  The best thing to do is simply enjoy that feeling- the feeling of being excited and aroused.  Doing something about those feelings opens up a whole new can of worms.  If you think you are confused now...    Learn to deal properly with those feelings and emotions.  As you get used to them, you will find that your confusion will lessen and that you will be able to make better, more clear-headed decisions.    Best of luck to you!|`|AA12279165	i think it's kindda normal to like a boy if you're a girl..unless you're a girl who likes a girl then that makes you a lesbian..however you're normal but a little unstable..and don't have sex until you're maried..ok??|`|5bc998621a15e006b8832697972849e4aa	Ummm.....Thanks for telling me this info...please give me ten points! did i mention how pretty you are!|`|036ce28b5c83af0146eed58b082f9aaaaa	the first step to having what you want is knowing what you want.|`|3c3564aed52dcba96879e6bbb1009168aa	You're a teenage girl, nothing is wrong with being a little boy crazy...and I'm sure you'll find a guy you're age who you like very much and who likes you|`|4f21ae5e93082cece061b5844fececd9aa	hormons,|`|83c0ce06555bfbf88d25f4477fb9290daa	nothing is wrong-that's completely normal! i still have problems like that to this day and i'll be a senior in high school this year. you just have to give yourself time to mature and figure out who'se an infaturation and who's the real deal

After all, you're the one who taught her how to go after other men, aren't you? I mean, aren't you in love with the male race?
AA11911871	I understand what you are going through dear. Weve all been there. Breaking up with someone you love is one of the most painful situations you ever have to face. In the aftermath of rejection, the hurt, the misery, the loneliness and the feeling that the future just disappeared, look as though theyll go on forever.    1) Dont see him  If he has to come to the flat, arrange for someone else to be there. Ban him from dropping in casually and ask him to remove the rest of his stuff as soon as possible.    2) Dont contact him  No more how are you getting on emails or Ive just found that shirt of yours phone calls. Forget about excuses to get in touch. It just keeps you hanging in there and hoping. If hes contacting you, ask him not to.    3) Dont go to the empty cupboard  Trying to find ways to fix or get back a relationship you know in your heart is over is like going to an empty cupboard hoping that instead of a few crumbs youll find a big fat loaf there. You wont, and as long as youre going back to that cupboard you wont see the deliciously full one just around the corner. Close the door on it and walk away.    4) Talk about him less  Going over every detail of what happened with friends may feel comforting initially, but after a few weeks its time to stop. Friends get bored and you get stuck. So be very selective about what you say and the people you say it to and start talking about other things.    5) Stop giving yourself a hard time  So you werent perfect. Well neither was he. You both did your best to make it work and it didnt. Put it down to experience and forget about blaming him or yourself. Blaming anyone hurts only you and holds you back from recovery.    6) Think of yourself as over it  Imagine a date a few weeks away when instead of feeling awful youll wake up and know youre over it. The sun will come out, gorgeous men will appear from nowhere and youll feel like going out and living life again. Why wait? Draw that day towards you, so that it becomes tomorrow. Feel the excitement of knowing you did it, you survived and life is good again. Now hang onto that feeling.    Stage two  1) Feel GorgeousSelf-esteem takes a tumble after a break-up and you have to rebuild it step by step. Feeling Gorgeous is vital, and anyone can do it. Tell yourself youre sexy, charismatic, bright and desirable  and listen to friends who think you are too. Act Gorgeous by pampering yourself, even if you dont feel like it and dont think it will make a difference. Believe me, it will!    2) Start Flirting  Whats important now is to meet lots of people, men and women, and talk, smile, flirt, take an interest and laugh with them. Life as part of a couple often limits contact with other people. Now its time to get really sociable.  Dont know how to meet people? This is an excuse to hide behind. If you want to meet people, you will. Make a list, right now, of all the ways you could do this. Join an evening class youve always wanted to take such as Italian. Try something physically demanding such as rock climbing or arrange a get-together with old friends.    3) Take your time  Dont jump hastily into any romantic relationships. The rule tends to be that if you rush in fast it will end fast too. So go slowly. If you fancy someone, great, but hold back for a while and remember that this new you is in charge and neednt hurry.     Sticking to this plan takes discipline and courage. But remember that no-one else can do it for you, its up to you.     If you really want to do it, you will.    all the best sis, u deserve to be happy|`|d7f25ebc36a708ade09054bafdd2a85caa	sweet angel nailed it right on the head.  she took the words right out of my mind|`|AA11642773	i cant help you  sorry|`|7ea65ef8a946be12a63b6691797a89a2aa	Dating is like a pool... you don't test it you just jump right back in!    Best Wishes!|`|AA11613544	Ugh, for one thing, DONT pick someone up in a bar.  If you can pick that person up, chances are everyone else has picked them up too and they are there for the wrong reasons.  There are lots of things you can do.  Pick up a hobby, go out and do things in the public, join a church if that is your thing, take a class, meet people at work, hang out more with your friends and meet some of their other friends.  When its the right time, you will be able to do it.

If he is not married, it would be a violation to his would be wife. If he's married, this is an insult to his wife. Thanks
8e32f1becca74badafd66f76ea39c7e0aa	i never brought someone into my relationships and i never will. i participated in one though a very long time ago... and trust me, it ruins everything... to sit there and see your man put his thing into another woman, may not bother you at the time, because of the sexual feelings you may have, but it will catch up to you.  i know that couple broke up soon after that, and the girl, who was my friend, stopped talking to me... the one time she did, she told me nicely that she didnt want to know anything about me anymore, and that she couldnt shake out the thoughts of me and her man. i felt really bad to have caused that since they were sooo in love, and even thinking about marriage. that was the last time i did something like that.    you have to be a VERY strong woman, to be able to handle something like this... especially if you are only doing it for him.     but if its something you both like, then, i guess, do whatever you feel.|`|767fb983079af7d175626d393b95dea3aa	I understand the question, and i have thought about and still wnat to.

I have never been in a serious relationship where this has occurred but I have often thought that it would be a good way to spice things up as long as everyone knows the rules.  Communication is the key to making this type of "play" work.|`|634d74c89d1de645da2b24dba7416ab8aa	Yes i have, I was/ still am in a loving relationship, yet I wanted more than just sex with Richard (my boyfriend of 4 years), we were madly in love and good at sex. Yet I needed more. Then 6 months i was playing tennis with my best friend Sally, who had just split up with her boyfriend. We got into the shower, and then I had an urge to kiss her as she was all hot and sweaty. In then turned into full sex in the ladies changing room (luckly no one walked in). We then met up every week for sex. After a few times we started to film ourselfs.    3 months ago I walked in on Richard (he thought I was out shopping) having a good time with himself on the couch watching the films. He apologised. and 2 weeks later Sally came round for dinner. Beacause Sally was into group sex (I had never done it before) and Richard loved are tapes we gave him a 3 some. We all loved it so luch we now meet up for sex a few times a month.    What about you? Contact me|`|5ee83090b2c59c84b31ac7ed57aee521aa	i have thought about yes, but i get a bit funny about it im scared that it would damage my relationship.i love my man and i dont wanna share him or have him leave.

I still love her.    I know... How stupid can I be? And now, I'm winning her heart back from a guy that I have exactly don't have any details or info about.    And about your question... Yes...

60e8c3233b8b42282c76eb50fcf8c16eaa	Gosh...you are a really great friend, not..shame on you.    One of the most traumatising experiences (other than the rape itself) that a victim of rape goes through is not being believed....stop and think for a minute for gods sake. What if she WERE really raped...how do you think it would effect her already severely damaged psyche to know that you her friend, doesn't believe her.    And...what exactly do you think are the symptoms of being raped? Are you honestly ignorant enough to believe that all victims of rape come out of it battered, bruised and internally damaged? Please...if so, then for your friends sake do some more research. Quite often, people who have been raped show the same signs (physically) as someone who has just had sex with their partner. The mental scars however are broad ranging and varying in intensity. Some victim's simply cannot tolerate being around people who are the same sex as their rapist in the days after the attack...for others, this isn't an issue...everyone is different, every rape victim will go through different experiences...In general, what rape victims are suffering from in the days, weeks, months and years (again, the length of time, depends on how mentally stron the person was before the attack, and how much help/support/counselling they get afterwards) after is called P.T.S.D (Post traumatic stress disorder). The symtoms of PTSD are very varied, again, you should research this if you are concerned for your friend. Some people show lots of symptoms, some show none at all...delayed shock...denial, its amazing how a persons brain can react to such trauma.    You mention your friend filed a police report and had a rape kit done....have you ANY idea what an invasive procedure a rape kit is?? Do you HONESTLY believe that your friend would go through such humiliation and pain just to get some attention?    Stay away from this girl until you do some more research on this...god knows what damage you could do to her with your bad attitude...you could mess her up for life.|`|AA12263938	yes dear it seems that you are right

I'm assuming that your nickname being "Mrs." means you were married and that he is not simply an ex-boyfriend.  If you were married and you divorced, then the lifelong committment you made has been dissolved.  If he was your boyfriend, then there was no lifelong committment.

AA11879371	Remember too, that people do change with the years.  There were several very good suggestions.  But interests change and priorities change, children are mixed into the equation.  Always make time for each other and treat each other special.    One person may be having a rough time, (pregnancy, changing hormones,  loss of a parent, loss of a job, car accident)  Allow them time to grieve their losses.  Support them, listen to them.    Remember anniversaries, birthdays, help with the holidays, the house, the kids, the laundry, the dishes, the in-laws.    Share the big decisions, like having kids, buying a house, moving, buying a car, burial and funeral arrangements.  Have a will, just in case.  Share the little decisions if they will have an impact on your partner.    Settle arguments with grace and tactfulness.  Stay away from name calling.  If you can't say anything good, . . . . . . . .    Love and care for each other.  Good luck and take care.|`|6a15f58c8ab23fab792f2a808a7dd8beaa	just dont try to be something.be as u are|`|AA10906330	Love her, talk to her, listen to her (don't just "hear", yes there's a difference!), hold her, caress her, be her best friend...forever....even in your relationship.     Oh, and she should do the same for you! Be there for eachother, through thick and thin. Also, be open to disagreements. No relationship is perfect, and only a true loves arguments/fights/disagreements make their love stronger...Trust me!

So it we both made an effort to break out of that normal routine. A good idea is to make a date night and perhaps switch off who plans it each time. For instance, I plan this week and he'll plan next week. Also, don't spend ALL your time together... you'll never have anything to talk about! Random presents/things to let me know he thought about me are always nice touches to make me feel special.|`|a02bfbe52840b447a3afa3780035e275aa	Sorry to tell you this, but a lot of it is pretty cliche. If a guy did the following things, I'd be stupid to leave him:    -makes me feel really listened to  -doesn't make me feel stupid  -doesn't always have to be right  -believes we are equal- as in, doesn't think I should do certain things because I'm the GIRL  -shares his day to day life with me  -compromises  -doesn't take **** from me or anyone  -remembers things, birthdays and memories  -leaves me flowers on random days    **** like that.  if this girl isn't going to give these things back to you, don't put so much effort into it.  make sure she's about being 50/50 with you, too.|`|f3bb7c7296242c9700b1d014719b22e8aa	Love each other with all that you have.

Also, good sex and taking lots of walks together.|`|c8c333b409e0443d5fb55a13be178adeaa	I'm not a girl but...  If the other is your love interest then why would you need to try to keep yourself wanting to stay with him/her?  Love is not rocket science. Just do what's natural...if its not natural and you have to try, its probably not real love...

311112b83d5a3836526fa6df56216c23aa	I bet you mean son.  It is true that he is 23 but he is still not independent being that he is taking her to your house.  You need to step up and have him respect your home, if that is what you want him to do but if he is helping you financially and you prefer for him to stay then I guess you'll need to play the fool.  The one thing you should keep in mind is that if you don't have him start acting responsible he will soon bring a child and you'll be stuck with the three.  Have him get a job, pay for a hotel and know that the minute he has a "problem" he will need to get his independence and take care of himself and rent his own place.  If you pick up **** in your house soon he'll **** on you too.|`|2821cf4b9ac80ebf99889896139f8f97aa	First of all he would understand that while he was living under my roof that would not be allowed.

523bd91a232d051bcaa539a6b3d1ec5caa	Love is a choice, not a feeling.  It's not something that will magically hit you like "Oh I'm in love."  You can choose to love him or you can choose to not love him.  Anyone can be in a casual relationship, but to love is a much deeper commitment.    You are pretty young in our culture to be in love but it's certainly possible.  Most people in our culture are just self centered people that can't choose to commit and love; hence the terrible divorce rate. They think they need to live together and test the waters first or whatever.  That's bogus.  You can find out all the important stuff you need to know about a person without living with them.     The fluttery feelings come and go, and when they go, then what?  You choose to love them regardless.  The good news for you is that you aren't married and can still make that choice of whether or not this is a healthy relationship.|`|AA11305458	Are you gonna listen to anyone about this, or just wait for the answer you want?  Because the people who say you are too young are right.  But maybe they have never told you why you are too young.      Well, I will, so here goes.  First off, I do not believe you can truely know a person until you live with them and experience everyday life with them.  Financial, domestic, educational responsibilities.  Second, you are no where near finished becoming who you are going to be someday.  Finishing school, going to college, getting a career, all that shapes who you are.  Likewise, it also shapes who he is.  The chances that you both will still love the new people you become over time is slim.  Heck, you may  not even like each other.  With time comes change and at your age, there is alot of change to come.      You are infatuated with this guy.  The english chat room guy, give me a break.  He could be anyone.  Could be an old man wanting to get with a little girl.  Happens everyday.  Could be a killer, or a girl, or anyone.  You can never truly love someone till you have spent one on one time with them living life.      Now, I am not saying dump this guy and move on, it is fine to stay together and see how things turn out, bu don't be surprised if you wake up one day and wonder what you once loved is now gone.|`|0c620f8231891c12a94b004f070e9a57aa	Love is when you can't think of anyone or anything else.  Love is when you are happy just being in his presence.  Love is when you would do ANYTHING just to be by his side.|`|0e999f5ffc3b68a26b333974da10ffbdaa	You don't know but you can find out by waiting... give things time hang with him some more and you'll find out you sound like a great girl he would be a fool to leave you...|`|1e62e5bcf71c0213e1c3d3f2dd4deb60aa	sorry hun but you used the word boy if you were in love it would be a man it's probably just a crush or ifatuation ...means you think you love him   you really ...really like him is all it's a crush dear  Thought I was in love with this guy when I was 15.... I grew up never give him the time of day now ..... How stupid I was to think that I loved him.... But I am not calling you stupid you just need to grow a little older then you will know what love is    due to the fact it will be a feeling you cant live with out the one who makes you feel   sssssssssooooooooooooooooooo.... Can't tell you what you feel but... there are alot of emotions out there you have to figure this one out your still young relax... Hint... I am 28 and still don't know what it is but be careful cause there r 2 kinds   such as   yes I love you and care about you ... But then I am in love with you and would do anything sugar love is a hecktic think  I still can't tell if I am in love or not and I had the same guy and still going on for 2 years  trust me it's not all that it's cracked up to b|`|e7859851feb4de35a1483d461ae3926caa	I am no expert in love but I'll tell you what i do know o.k dear.  Do u enjoy spending time with him,does he laugh at your jokes even if they're stupid.when you're with him how does it fell in your heart. do u get goose bumps when he touches you. do u get excited when you know he's coming and eager when he's gone, do you always want to make him happy and most of all are you happy with him.  People seems to think that you have to be of a certain age to be in love but i really don't agree. anyone is capable of love age doesn't matter. i can't really say if you are in love but what i can tell you is if you really like(love) him them the answer is in your heart only you can know those feelings.|`|a056c28f3454b612c656d82696a59791aa	don't listen to other people. other people screw you over. what do you think yourself?|`|54b8859ecb980b31084715ec241def92aa	Pray and ask GOD he'll let you know.|`|3b45d0b36f03c1eaeb90850cca750e8eaa	you need to relax. you are making yourself all upset for nothing. you are young and will love alot of guys. you will know when you are in love. you can feel it. talk to the guy on line, date, have fun. love should not be stressfull.

Si tu ahora tienes esa oportunidad, aprovechala, debes quitarte esos nervios y relajarte y hacer de ese encuentro un momento agradable e inolvidable,  tanto para ti como para esa persona.

Que linda pesonita sos!!! aunque ahora no nos demos cuenta todos vamos a llegar a esa etapa de la vida ?no?  Tu abuelita tiene la suerte de tenerte incondicionalmente a su lado y en su interior seguro que lo valora muchisimo, pero ademas decis que siempre espera un regalito ?A quien no le gustan los regalitos? Yo no se si tu abuela se encuentra en plena conciencia como para ir sonsacandole con cari?o  que cosas le gustan, de todos modos y mediante una charla puedes ir dandote cuenta que cosas la pueden hacer feliz...por ejemplo a mi me encanta leer y me gustaria que me lean cuando sea grande si es que no lo puedo hacer por mis propios medios...una idea es que un dia lleves un libro que no sea triste porfa, algo de aventuras ,algo que levante el animo y cada vez que vas, leerselo de a poco, seguro ella va estar esperando el momento de tu visita para que sigas leyendolo y juntas viajar con la imaginacion; a la vez cada vez que vayas puedes ir con un peque?o detalle (algunos ya te tiraron ideas), puede ser  una plantita que ella pueda regar todos los dias...tambien un juego de mesa para intercalar y pasar un rato agradable. Por ultimo te doy una idea que realmente no se si les va a vos y a tu abuela y a la residencia donde vive, pero el a?o pasado en el colegio donde iba mi hijo de 6 a?itos, se les ocurrio que las mamas armemos un arbol de navidad original creado por nosotras, hay muchas maneras de hacerlo es cuestion de imaginacion, no tiene que ser un arbol de 2 metros OK? Habia arboles tan hermosos y distintos a los convencionales...con mo?os coloridos hechos con cinta de papel y angelitos esparcidos en el (la imaginacion y la creatividad no tienen limites). Nosotras elegimos para donarlo una residencia de abuelos y ademas se nos ocurrio poner regalos que todos los abuelos pudieran compartir por ejemplo juegos de mesa, si no tienes para comprarlos siempre hay gente buena que te puede ayudar por ejemplo tus amigos...todos tenemos algun juego que ya ni usamos y estan en perfecto estado. Esta idea te la doy para cuando vaya llegando la epoca de navidad. Otras ideas para tu abuelita puede ser que le guste tejer y lo pueda hacer, llevale lanas y ahujas para hacer cosas sencillas como puede ser un almohadon o todos los que ella quiera y luego conseguir los materiales para rellenarlos juntas.Una tia de mi esposo disfrutaba mucho en verano que el le llevara un helado por que le encantaban... El tema es que se sienta util, amada y acompa?ada. Por ultimo te pido no sientas pena, a mi no me gustaria que me sientan pena y a vos?  Sentita orgullosa de vos misma, no todos hacen lo que haces vos por sus mayores...

Si te dice que cuando era joven le gustaba algo en particular, busca uno igual. Si te dice que le gustaban las flores, llvale un ramo de sus flores favoritas. Si te dice que hace tiempo que no sabe de alguien y que le gustara verlo o algo, intenta encontrar a esa persona. O busca entre las fotos que puedas tener guardadas y hazle un lbum con anotaciones. Si tienes hijos o hay algn beb en la familia, llvalo, que a los ancianos les suele gustar los bebs. Y si no sabes qu regalarle, cuando te pregunte si le has trado algo, dile que qu quiere que le traigas la prxima vez, que t se lo llevas.

Vocs at podem se "divertir" um tempinho com esses caras, mas nunca vai passar disso, ou se passar, se chegar a conquistar um desses e ele resolver at casar, vai ser um galinha enchendo sua cabe?a de galhos ou um frustrado que teve de deixar as nicas coisas que ele sabia fazer, ser engra?ado e contar papo", ou seja ter um casamento infeliz que provavelmente n?o durara muito tempo.|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	que seja eterno enquanto dure !|`|96f0003338aef08e81dc4c6e10c6473daa	Sim... basta querer...

AA11316159	If you look at the life behind these girls, you may not be surprised to learn that they grew up in a household where their fathers beat up and insulted their mothers and/or fathers that drank too much.    Girls who grow up in this type of household situation will almost always choose a man just like her father.  Most of the time, she does not even realize that this is what she is doing in choosing an abusive husband.  She has made this bad choice because something deep inside her mind "recognizes" something familiar in this man she believes she loves.   It is a very sad cycle.    The answer is education.  Alcoholism is a disease, but it doesn't just affect the one who drinks too much.  It also affects his or her family and, especially, the children.      Abusiveness is a pattern that has to be broken through education, too.    The most difficult part of getting the breaking the cycle of these illnesses and behaviors is getting people to recognize them because no wants their family to shun them and this is often what happens.  Once one family member becomes aware that the drinking and the beating and insulting is wrong and begins to try to convince other family members that it is wrong, it's very common for the person who has recognized the wrongness to be ridiculed and rejected by the rest of the family.    A lot of these behaviors are, unfortunately, cultural, too.  There are countries where it is still acceptable for a man to be drunk and beat his wife and children.  So long as he goes to work and brings home a check, he is considered a man and a provider.  These cultures also are more private than American culture, I believe, and they keep their personal problems to themselves.    I don't think their freedom of choice has too much to do with it, really.  I think a girl's family could just as easily make such a mistake in arranging a marriage for her because if the father has these behaviors, he is not going to see any wrong in them, even if he chooses for his daughter a man as horrible as himself.    And, where you say "...she is desperately looking for true love but in in vain?"  Until she learns and recognizes the reasons for her bad choice and until she learns that she is worth much more, she will usually continue to make the same poor choices.    Unfortunately, we cannot fix others; we can only fix ourselves.|`|2889b7708743bbca0b71792f90a65926aa	It means we aren't always emotionally equipped to make the best choices for ourselves.  I think most women will tell you they had at least one "bad boy" in their lives.  I think we believe that if we love them enough, they will change...or the same person that turns abusive can often be very romantic and exciting to us.  It is important to know who you are and who you are with and we often ignore our red flags when things don't turn out as we wished.  We learn from it and move on...and learn the only person we can change is ourselves.|`|AA12253534	i think you right but they only follow they heart and it bc of the guys girls have nothing to do with it it men false bc they act like nice person to get what he want

Por isso, procure salvar sua famlia, seja honesto(a) e tenha humbridade, em sua vida.|`|80741488f96faed9c45a51ae6ad8ea11aa	O Que ensina a Bblia sobre o casamento? O casamento  uma liga??o permanente e dedicada entre um homen e uma mulher. A Bblia diz em Mateus 19:5-6 Deus ordenou: Por isso deixar o homem pai e m?e, e unir-se- a sua mulher; e ser?o os dois uma s carne? Assim j n?o s?o mais dois, mas um s carne. Portanto o que Deus ajuntou, n?o o separe o homem.   Como devem os maridos tratar as suas esposas? A Bblia diz em Efsios 5:25-28 Vs, maridos, amai a vossas mulheres, como tambm Cristo amou a igreja, e a si mesmo se entregou por ela, a fim de a santificar, tendo-a purificado com a lavagem da gua, pela palavra, para apresent-la a si mesmo igreja gloriosa, sem mcula, nem ruga, nem qualquer coisa semelhante, mas santa e irrepreensvel. Assim devem os maridos amar a suas prprias mulheres, como a seus prprios corpos. Quem ama a sua mulher, ama-se a si mesmo.   Os maridos devem tratar as suas esposas com respeito e honra. A Bblia diz em 1 Pedro 3:7 Igualmente vs, maridos, vivei com elas com entendimento, dando honra  mulher, como vaso mais frgil, e como sendo elas herdeiras convosco da gra?a da vida, para que n?o sejam impedidas as vossas ora??es.   Como devem as mulheres tratar os seus maridos? A Bblia diz em Efsios 5:22-24 Vs, mulheres, submetei-vos a vossos maridos, como ao Senhor; porque o marido  a cabe?a da mulher, como tambm Cristo  a cabe?a da igreja, sendo ele prprio o Salvador do corpo. Mas, assim como a igreja est sujeita a Cristo, assim tambm as mulheres o sejam em tudo a seus maridos.   Significa isto que a mulher deve ser a nica a submeter-se? N?o! Num casamento ambos se submetem. A Bblia diz em Efsios 5:21 Sujeitando-vos uns aos outros no temor de Cristo.   Que conselho Bblico probe o abuso fsico e verbal? A Bblia diz em Colossenses 3:19 19Vs, maridos, amai a vossas mulheres, e n?o as trateis asperamente.   Para ter um bom casamento, resolvam as vossas diferncias imediatamente. A Bblia diz em Efsios 4:26 Irai-vos, e n?o pequeis; n?o se ponha o sol sobre a vossa ira.   Fa?a com que a rela??o esteja sempre a melhorar no sentido de unidade e de entendimento da parte um do outro. A Bblia diz em Efsios 4:2-3 Com toda a humildade e mansid?o, com longanimidade, suportando-vos uns aos outros em amor, procurando diligentemente guardar a unidade do Esprito no vnculo da paz.   Que perspectiva deve ter a sociedade sobre o casamento? A Bblia diz em Hebreus 13:4 Honrado seja entre todos o matrim?nio e o leito sem mcula; pois aos devassos e adlteros, Deus os julgar.   Que mandamentos deu Deus para proteger o casamento? O sptimo e o dcimo mandamento. A Bblia diz em xodo 20:14, 17 N?o adulterars.  N?o cobi?ars a casa do teu prximo, n?o cobi?ars a mulher do teu prximo, nem o seu servo, nem a sua serva, nem o seu boi, nem o seu jumento, nem coisa alguma do teu prximo.   Qual  a nica raz?o vlida que Jesus deu que permite o divrcio? A Bblia diz em Mateus 5:32 Eu, porm, vos digo que todo aquele que repudia sua mulher, a n?o ser por causa de infidelidade, a faz adltera; e quem casar com a repudiada, comete adultrio.   Quanto tempo deve durar o casamento? A Bblia diz em Romanos 7:2 Porque a mulher casada est ligada pela lei a seu marido enquanto ele viver; mas, se ele morrer, ela est livre da lei do marido.   Que instruc??es d a Bblia sobre com quem nos devemos casar? A Bblia diz em 2 Corntios 6:14 N?o vos prendais a um jugo desigual com os incrdulos; pois que sociedade tem a justi?a com a injusti?a? ou que comunh?o tem a luz com as trevas?    O roman?e e o sexo recebem as ben??os de Deus quando usados dentro do casamento. A Bblia diz em Provrbios 5:18-19 Seja bendito o teu manancial; e regozija-te na mulher da tua mocidade. Como cor?a amorosa, e graciosa cabra montesa saciem-te os seus seios em todo o tempo; e pelo seu amor s encantado perpetuamente.|`|508f9b97b7f500e019722264009c65d9aa	N?o. Mas devem tomar conta sempre dos filhos. Acaba-se o casamento mas n?o a paternidade/maternidade.|`|8216bd7871ce3fe39ade7a6adcdb58bdaa	N?o. As pessoas de permanecerem juntas porque se amam,  o unico motivo para manter uma convivncia familiar.|`|5290e2a01a604917e388c15248294c92aa	Devem fazer o possvel para permanecer juntos, vencer as incompatibilidades, enfim cederem, mudarem, crescerem, amadurecerem...mas se n?o houver respeito pelo outro (e por si mesmo), se n?o puder ser preservada a dignidade de cada um, ent?o as pessoa n?o amadurecem, "apodrecem", "cristalizam" e isso n?o  bom para a pessoa, para o outro e muito menos para os filhos.   Quando me separei, encontrei um amigo de meu ex marido, que me disse que sentiu muito a nossa separa??o, disse a ele que agradecia a atitude solidria, mas que n?o sentisse, pois ambos (meu ex e eu) havamos estagnado e isso n?o era saudvel para ningum.  Depois quase namorei um rapaz que estava se separando, tinha uma filha e me disse que estava indo em um psiclogo, pois embora n?o estivesse t?o bem com a mulher, pensava na filha e estava sentindo muita falta da sua casa (estava morando com a m?e), pois havia se acostumado  rotina. Aconselhei-o a voltar para a casa dele, se n?o estava bem assim. Ele me atraa muito, mas n?o ia adiantar contradize-lo, alm do mais conhecia a mulher dele (comercialmente) e era uma pessoa muito agradvel e simptica, disse que achava isso dela, n?o fazendo outros comentrios (ela era gorda, mas acho que isso n?o  o mais importante e pode ser reversvel). Ele tentou voltar para casa, mas n?o deu certo, separou-se.  Por ironia do destino houve um desencontro entre ns, ele me convidou para sair, n?o deu certo; ele achou que eu tinha algum e n?o tinha;  quando eu quis ele n?o aceitou mais.  Tem gente que antes de ser j era, como diz a minha m?e. Acabei namorando outra pessoa, com a qual estou h 14 anos, tambm separado e tem uma filha.  Passados 8 anos, por motivo de trabalho tive que acertar pendncias de outro funcionrio, com vrios fornecedores, com todos cheguei num consenso, menos com ele. Aconselhei-o ent?o a agir de outra forma e pedir o acrto por outros meios.  Uma amiga minha era muito amiga da irm? daquele rapaz, fizemos uma grande amizade e sem que perguntasse a irm? me falou muito dele (n?o convivi nada) e pude perceber que a beleza dele era s aparncia; por ser muito intransigente, enfim uma pessoa de difcil convivncia. Me livrei de uma boa.   Meu atual marido foi fazer alguns servi?os para a famlia, contei a ele o ocorrido. Acabou enfrentando problemas, mas como  muito boa pessoa e bom profissional, teve paciencia e enfrentou bem a situa??o.   O que eu quero te dizer com tudo isso? Que a gente nunca perde por ser correta. Converse francamente com ele como amiga, fa?a-o refletir e pesar se  s por causa da filha que n?o quer se separar. Se ele n?o estiver sendo sincero com a mulher e a filha vier a saber vai ficar traumatizada com casamento e mesmo que ela n?o saiba, se o relacionamento n?o for bom, idem. A educa??o se d pelo exemplo e o melhor , sem dvida, n?o se separar; mas viver uma farsa  pssimo para todos, decepciona muito mais do que ver o pai separado, mas podendo acreditar que as pessoas tem integridade.  Se um casal se separa deve manter um relacionamento amistoso, no caso de ter filhos. H casais que adiam tanto uma separa??o, que quando se separam tem dio um do outro, esgotam as agress?es morais e partem para as fsicas. H algo pior para um filho do que isso? Assim  melhor vislumbrar o rumo que as coisas podem tomar e evitar que se esgotem.  Seja amiga dele, fique em paz com sua conscincia e ajude-o a decidir pelo melhor; s vezes as situa??es se invertem, ou seja tem maridos que falam mal da mulher, mas eles  que s?o os problemticos.|`|c143088d4cb65f531df38f0053aaf5f3aa	nao !! se eles nao se amam + e vivem brigando !!! acho uma besteira fikrem juntos !!!|`|266b79a9e2f57afd9a8bb45cc26ef1e3aa	EU ACHO QUE N?O.

Acho que um casal deve fazer o possvel para que n?o haja uma separa??o. Porm se o casamento ou o relacionamento n?o est mais dando para continuar, se existe realmente motivos suficientemente fortes pra se separarem,  melhor que o fa?am mesmo que ele, o casal, tenha filhos. Por mais infelizes que fiquem os filhos, provavelmente ficariam mais ainda convivendo com pais em desarmonia, brigas e at mesmo agress?o fsica pois sabemos que existem casais que se agridem fisicamente mas n?o se separam.

AA11902484	because you realize you want to be with the person and you cant and it kills you inside ....you can tell the other person how you feel but not being able to show how you feel is what usually breaks long distance relationships|`|AA11588385	Because the realization of distance deters or retards progression in the relationship.|`|91c149dd40f5e6806c1c3cda036265a1aa	Challenging and difficult, though they may not be what we want to hear, are the words that best describe long distance relationships. Keep in mind however, that the words are challenging and difficult, not impossible. Many people choose to give a long distance relationship a try, with the constant curiosity if it was the right decision to make and if it even stands a chance. The truth is, a long distance relationship has just as much a chance of succeeding as any other relationship!     Long Distance Relationships share the same facts as an average relationship. It involves two people who share an interest in each other's lives, care for one another and of course have a love for each other that they hope will only continue to grow. On the other hand, a long distance relationship does have its differences as well. It takes away your ability to see each other on a frequent note, as well as the choice of being intimate whenever you desire, not to mention that there would be major trust required. Being unable to spend time together in a physical presence makes it harder to hang on to, but does not spell out doom for your relationship.     The first step is to make an agreement of what your expectations are in the relationship and how much of a commitment you are willing to give and receive. If the two of you decide to be monogamous, then it is clear that neither of you will be dating anyone else as long as your romantic relationship exists. Being clear about what you both want is extremely important, especially in a long distance relationship, in order to prevent future misunderstandings and mistakes. Do not feel afraid to tell your partner what you really need and want from him or her, you deserve the chance to speak from your heart and he or she deserves to know the truth and judge whether they can give it to you.     Trust is a major necessity if you wish to have your relationship from a distance. Without trust and honesty, the relationship is in for danger and unsuccessfulness, just as it would be any other relationship. By accepting the challenge of a long distance relationship, you also accepted the fact that you will have to have the trust and faith that your partner will not be seeing anyone else as promised. Being paranoid and accusing will only grow doubts, insecurity and tension between you and none of those three will help the relationship survive successfully.     Keeping each other informed of the friendships you have with other people and the events that take place in your personal life is a great way to keep your relationship alive and healthy; and continues to make your partner a part of your life. It is essential that you receive the same information from your partner as well, so you both feel the same security and satisfaction that you both crave. Be creative with the way you keep in touch, such as calling, e-mailing, faxing and sending cards. Pay attention to how many times a week you are staying in touch as well. If you want your bond to stay strong and loving, you have to hear from one another often, leaving as little room for any of you to start getting paranoid about anything. Although you cannot be romantic towards each other on a physical note, you can still perform romantic acts that will keep the romance department happy. You can do this by sending love letters and poems, having flowers and gifts delivered, or even sending a video of yourself with a loving message. Reminding your partner of how much you think about and love him or her will score high points, making them miss you more with the constant urge to see you.     Planning reunions play a big part in keeping your relationship exciting, plus serve you the satisfaction of being able to see and touch each other occasionally. It gives you the opportunity to catch up on each other's life in person and to be able to share physical and intimate activities together, which will fulfill both of your needs and desires. Not re-uniting every once in a while will only damage the relationship you have, so if one of you are not willing to visit the other occasionally, then you may need to question the interest and care your partner has for you and should probably end the relationship and move on. If you and your partner truly want this to work out, then you will both continue to be eager to see each other as often as you can and every time to have the chance to.     Setting a limit of how long you will be apart is a wise thing to do if you do not want to end up waiting forever. There will be a day when you and your partner will have to start planning a serious future, which can only happen when you are living in the same area or perhaps even living together, whichever makes you most comfortable. If none of you are willing to agree on a place to settle and start having a relationship where you see each other on a regular basis, then you can pretty much forget about accomplishing anything out of your long distance relationship. If your partner truly loves you and wants to be with you, then they would not want to wait forever to be with you.     With the right amount of effort and interest on both parts, a long distance relationship can survive the obstacles it will frequently be challenged with. As long as you both refresh your memories of why you chose to do this in the first place, trust each other, inform one another of your personal lives, keep in touch, and visit, your relationship can turn out to be one of the most successful and happy relationships that ever existed. You both will be secure, happy and satisfied until the day comes when you will re-unite for good and build your wonderful future together.|`|783790d2e390744c84aedd9b8265ad1aaa	Because you are not sharing a life together, there are no shared experiences or knowing each other's daily moods during the ebb and flow of life. Don't deny yourself by having a long distance relationship. It's rarely fair for either person. Go local.|`|49dc09d0101f98ed2ef215053d471e63aa	coz the cock isnt lond enuf

9feab661eab93a7b315eadbc5d69d940aa	Concordo plenamente  Usemos como exemplo, o mais popular de todos os exemplos, o  "CORNO".  Sim vc o conhece, o corno lembra, aquele que  "Sempre o ltimo a saber".  E quando ele descobre, muitas vezes olha ao redor e descobre que o ditado popular  verdico.  (Corno)-"Voc sabia? E vc tb? E at vc? At vc sabia?"  (Sdicos disfar?ados de amigos) -"A gente n?o queria que vc sofresse....."    Bom, e o que ele est fazendo agora? Sofrendo.    N?o tem como mentira perdurar pra sempre.  ilus?o achar que vai proteger algum mentindo at o tmulo. SEGREDOS s?o pecinhas de crian?a, escudos dos fracos que se quebram com mais facilidade que o vidro. Porque ns seres humanos temos os OLHOS, os espelhos da alma. E a conscincia, o maior e mais eterno de todos os carrascos.    Zanza e cia - A vida pertence a "ele" (no caso "O corno" por ex) , n?o a vc, vc n?o seria ningum para decidir em seu lugar se ele sofreria ou n?o, nem para escolher quando e como ele deve sofrer, muito menos para proteger sem o consentimento da pessoa. Ridculo, at pq um dia a mscara cai. E nesse momento prefiro estar ao lado da pessoa e apoi-la, tir-la do buraco, do que fingiir que posso navegar o barco da vida dos outros, jogar o malabarismo dos outros, viver a vida dos outros no lugar deles. Prefiro que nesse momento a pessoa se lembre que tem minha verdadeira amizade, do que cuspir em meu rosto e me chamar de falso amigo. A sim a pessoa estar realmente sozinha. E n?o creia que basta "fazer sua parte" oferecendo ajuda depois de negar a verdade. A pessoa prefere ficar s do que mal acompanhada. Se quiser fazer sua parte, fa?a antes, aja pela pesoa, ao invs de encolher os ombros e querer bater no peito pra dizer que  uma pessoa amiga.  Quem ama ou sequer gosta, AGE. Como agiria por si mesmo.  A pessoa n?o tem o DIREITO de querer "proteger os sentimentos" da marido, esposa, filha, irm? com a mentira. Isso impede a outra pessoa de amadurecer por dentro.  Antes dor, do que ilus?o.|`|8fa9b8b254a16fa99e6aeb66ab3893aeaa	Com certeza q sim.  sempre melhor falar a verdade, mas as vezes, em alguns casos temos q omiti-la para o bem de algum.|`|b054b42d2ed8012792cb07db8f2f4fc3aa	eu acho que mentir  ruim pois omitir n?o.

A sinceridade  uma coisa muito linda quando usada de forma correta. Tudo depende de como se fala. A verdade deve ser dita com amor. Se  um relacionamento verdadeiro, nada melhor do que ser um livro aberto, pois um relacionamento veradadeiro se tem amor, n?o aquele amor passageiro, mas aquele amor que tudo compreende, tudo espera, tudo suporta.  Esta msica fala tudo o que o meu cora??o sente:    "Toda verdade dita sem amor   como uma flecha que s causa dor  Vai machucando sem ter permiss?o  Vai suportando um outro cora??o  Quem ama espera a hora de falar  N?o se apressa e sabe ponderar  Sempre h um lado que n?o  o seu  Que sempre revela o que ainda n?o cresceu  Ns nascemos pro amor  Pro amor ns vamos voltar  Toda famlia deve conversar  E o seu cora??o poder escutar  Num simples olhar receber perd?o  Segredo mais forte dessa uni?o  Quem se respeita sabe respeitar  Come?a em si esse tal dom de amar  Tudo o que fazes com teu cora??o   o que ofereces para o teu irm?o  Estende a m?o a quem te respeitar  E o teu cora??o a quem n?o te amar   um segredo que te p?e de p  A humildade s te d mais f  Espera aquele que ainda n?o chegou  E aprende com outro que j semeou  Cada pessoa tem o seu lugar  O inferno come?a no se comparar"|`|a85351f11730b3a0b627b3fc533c2be3aa	Acho que sim, nao importa o qto a verdade possa doer mas sempre dizer a verdade.

Of course he's going to get mad, and he will see that you don't want him, so he'll toss you out (or he should anyway, after you start playing your mindgames).  You're going to have to find some other way to change your guy to always like you, or anyways leave and find someone else (after you at least tell this guy what your turnoff is about).

It usually ends with her looking tired and spent with "you know what" all over her face. I think it's sick. But that's me. If you really want it, you should go for it, it will probably be your only chance. It might cause some problems in your relationship though.

You could end up enjoying the friends company more than the guy you have been with for 7 years or you may not like it and be hounded for a very long time to do it again. Your man and his bud could end up hating one another afterward. I thought I was ready to do this ....until it came down to it and I never got over it (ruined the relationships).

If some does something crazy or does things that they will regret in the future when they are drunk, it means that they can not handle their liquor. Yes, alcohol impairs the mind but everyone knows that and therefore, should limit the use of it so nothing like that would happen. Girl, if he did it to you one time and can happen again and you dont wanna be in that situation again.   Ask yourself this: If you do decide to take him back, what if one night he is out drinking and gets drunk and ends up having sex with another girl? You gonna forgive him again? If so, its gonna be a repeated process. If you keep taking him back over this then he will start to feel like whenever he does that, you are going to take him back anyway.

Everything done in the dark has to come to light. Those things believe it or not have a way of finding you. In the mean time enjoy yourself and look for ways to enjoy your partner. Life is too short to search for things that tear you down. If you are that uncomfortable with your mate leave.|`|65d47401b5062c5ce058cfde6f66abceaa	Ask your partner if they would go swinging with you?    If they say NO straight out then they are having an affair!    The phychology behind this is they will not want you to do what they are doing in front of them!

Tell them that before you ask this question, this would be the best chance to save your relationship, or stop it before it goes really shitty. Ask the question, and this is the really important part, believe the answer!|`|d5b362c9cbe7e1c8df5380c1ebeccc0eaa	if you are even at the point where you feel the need to ask this question, then should you not just finish it now? If you have doubts then something has happened to plant those seeds. Take it from someone who has been there - trust your instinct!|`|4bd6c3434fd7cb958b92891af6d4cb88aa	Short, easy way: If your partner has a cell phone, take it without her knowing and call those numbers that you don't recognize and don't say anything to that person. If the first words you hear are: "Hey baby, how'cha doing?" or something like that, you know she's cheating on you.    Another way is by trying to have sex, although I would only recommend this if you're married. A woman who cheats on her partner will not want to have sex with the original partner because she's having sex with her secret lover.|`|AA11755038	ASK HER! if that fails check her behaviour out if she starts changing her routine. Is she overly nice to you. does she often make excuses to be late. Does she jump straight in the shower the minute she comes in. You could always hire a private-eye.  You know you must prepare yourself for the worst you know her better than anyone if she does any of the above your probably right. Take care  Dirky|`|d1000b3afe15cf1b2d54c98e1b0e48e7aa	And what would you do if you proved her to be a cheat.

Don't listen when she tells you its not what it looks like!  He slipped and landed in me,  we had our cloths on,  we can work it out.  Step and keep steeping, go back she will just see a .sucker.

You've done the right thing. You can't wait around forever.     if it is meant to be, it'll happen, and if not, then you're done wasting your time and you can find someone that truely cares for you and wants to be with you|`|d2e7ce73c0cdaf5ab1b0b6e39158a2aeaa	From experience, friends can not be lovers, it ruins the relationship. If you truly love him, let him go. Get on with your life, do not sit around and wonder if.........., we have all had bad experiences with past relationships, and if we all let the past get in our way, we would never have a future. I mean I have gotten over my fallacious past experiences, and now I have a wonderful husband who loves me.

Who knows what can happen|`|AA12274041	well, you could either a) ask him or b) look for signs, like...            1. does he play sticky eyes (when he/she looks someone in the eyes and when the other one looks into their eyes, the other person keeps looking            2. does he touch your arm or your back casually, such as when one of you tells a joke or in the hallway?    Good luck...but, my advice is if he does give you those signs and a few other unusual ones, THEN ask him if he likes you.

AA10401458	Why did the chicken cross the road?        Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?       A: To get to the other side.     Although perhaps the most famous of all jokes in the English language, this joke is a Non-joke, in that its humor value comes from the fact that it is expected to be funny. Additionally, it is rarely told on its own, but instead is referenced, modified, or parodied in a number of other jokes.    One of the many word-plays on the television series M*A*S*H was spoken by Hawkeye when the power-mad Frank Burns ordered the entire unit to move just a few dozen yards for no reason at all: "Why is this chicken outfit crossing the road?"        Q: Why did the turkey cross the road?       A: Because the chicken was on vacation.         Q: Why did the chicken cross the road in Texas?       A: To show the armadillo/opossum how it's done.         Q: Why did the chicken cross the M?bius strip?       A: To get to the same side.         Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?       A: Because it was too far to go around.         Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?       A: Colonel Sanders [of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame] was chasing it.

He has to get himself out there some in order for it to happen.  I already know you will introduce him to someone you think might be a good choice for him.  Go out with him from time to time...just the two of you...this will make it easier for him to meet new people.  I used to go out with my brother for this purpose...I guess they took my presence as a sign he must be okay.  He used to laughingly call me his "Chick Bait"...but (blush) it worked!  Good Luck.|`|ab029a498215848f7424a5da90f7c847aa	Have you ever stop to ask if he is gay?    I am not being mean but he may be hiding his sexuallity from his family! Be gentle & polite about it!    My brother was a latent homophobe but never brought girls around... one night while he was drunk (I don't drink) I asked if he had been with a guy before & he finally told me everything!    Now he is open with MOST of the family but it takes time... most families are or claim to be Christian & still have a problem with the thought of a gay member of the fam!    Go slow be nice & if not... he may just have an anti social behavioral issue that there are treatments for!|`|ea0c0b2ee1d6ac591c368a39ad677b76aa	your brother is lucky to have you, and you abviously care about him and his feelings,    Your brother is gong thru an awkward stage, and being used by girls, and not knowing how to act around girls, can make him a target for a lot of rejection.    I do not think you can find him a girlfriend, it is not lthat easy, and you can easily go fiind  a bike, or a car, or a pair of ski's but a human to be attracted to him is a big order,  My suggestion is if you are really serious, and want to help your brother get thru this stage of lhis life without too many negative experiences, is to hold llthose thoughts,  and "YOU" find some other friends, guys, maybe older, and more experienced, that you trust some what, and tell llthlem of this, and ask them for advice, and ask them if they would give your brother some good tips, it has to be a guy of your peers, but maybe older, and someone your brother respects, or admires, and maybe your brother will pay attention and take time to learn a few "social tips"  you can also find a group, a support group, of people of lyour age, where you all sit around and discusss similar problems,  Also church, there are great churches, that you can go and pay your respects to GOD, and meet nice people along the way, maybe a pastor can help, maybe the opportunity to meet nicer girls, will be there, and it will be a easier environment, for both or you,,  I hope you do help your brother, and i really admore you for the courage to go as far as asking for help,, dont quit,  you can have a tremendous influence on your brother,    and others,   good luck
d09073a7b339f007efcc05f8e0a67bdeaa	everyone is different. some are good speakers, others listeners, a few thinkers. you don't need to force yourself to open up when there really is no need to. its who you are an interpersonal character. one who appreciates things by yourself. of course there is a cliche: " no man is an island." and whether we like or not, sometimes we need to pretend like we appreciate others as well. pretense is the key word. but not in a negative light. to pretend means to act. and it needs to be practiced. just think of silly stuff, trivial things to say to people. create stories about you. they wont notice it. tell them youve tried this and that. youve heard that this and that is good. yada yada yada. just remember never ask personal questions like, "are you married?", or "do you have a boyfriend?" or "how much are you making now?" its rude and improper. practice makes perfect. by doing it constantly youll get the vibe. and someday it will just come out naturally. just try it you wont lose anything rather you will gain new friends.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Just relax and be yourself.  Smile and you will seem apporachable.  Try wearing something unique and unusual.  I have learned that it makes for a great icebreaker.  If the other person is the one who is wearing something unique and unusual, use that for the icebreaker.  All good conversations start with, "Hi!  My name is......."|`|e643b8219ff2696b25de8efe6b23a1ebaa	Hehe a major problem for me too.. But I try to open up on small things like "When did you graduated?" or "What course are you in?"

It can either bore people to death or start a huge political debate/fight..|`|AA11094855	Be a good listiner most people love good listeners. but look for someone who is very shy, try to become friends with them then you can open up to them.|`|AA10081376	just do not watch out for what others would think of you, and keep on being a good listener.

Everything should be in proportion by 30.|`|933652ebbcd9460158a8609715da7cb7aa	Actually, a man doesn't really finish growing into his "man's" body until early to mid twenties.

Example: There was this boy in my class an he was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fine, but he already had a girlfriend, so I thought he wasn't interested. One day I let him know that I liked him and I couldn't believe it when he told me he liked me enough to break up with his girl. It was so easy! Unfortunately, we broke up because he wanted to take it too fast. If you ever get the courage to ask this girl out, remember, take it slow and steady. I'm sure she'll love you.

Tis not all our fault... nor are all men the same.    I held a door open for a lady the other day and she grabs the door and says "go ahead" and let me go first.

5367c60ab005a15d8b90b207303209a4aa	Well I think it differs from woman to woman. Some do it to induldge in practicing more sex. Some do it because it's a form of what they think love is. Some do it because they can't commit to a relationship & some just do it because they can. What suits one doesn't always suit another, so who are we to judge what others do?|`|AA11726262	There's always been a double standard for male and female sexuality.  If it's a guy he's a stud.

b57fd060c6deeab88fde76ec23ed4edbaa	Fr mich pers?nlich liegen da Welten zwischen.    Zu meiner Mutter oder zu meinem Kind wrde ich niemals "ich liebe Dich" sagen.     "Ich liebe Dich" ist etwas, das fr mich wirklich nur fr die romantische Liebe steht.    "Ich hab' Dich lieb" kann ich wohl auch mal zu meinem Partner sagen, aber niemals "Ich liebe Dich" zu jemandem, den ich nicht als meinen Partner ansehe...     Und ehrlich gesagt k?me mir auch ein "Ich hab Dich lieb" zu einem Partner sehr merkwrdig vor...     Weil das - meinem Empfinden nach - wirklich eher der Satz ist, den man zu den eigenen Eltern oder Kindern sagt...

"Ich liebe dich" geht ja schon mehr in die Tiefe, dass hei?t, man hat eine innige Bindung zu der Person, also auch deine Mama in dem Fall. Ich differenziere aber schon, wem ich das Eine, und wem das Andere sage. Ich finde, "ich liebe dich" sollte man auch nur dann sagen, wenn man innerlich wirklich 100%tig sicher ist, dass man es so meint wie man es sagt. Sonst kann man damit auch ganz sch?n viel kaputt machen, wenn es hinterher doch nicht so ist (in einer Parnterschaft z.B).|`|cb85d7919482cc1c9fda9e149c88a4f0aa	es gibt   1. ich mag dich ( zur Freunden zu jedem kann man das  eigentlich sagen    2. ich hab dich lieb ( mehr wie m?gen nur zu Freunden und Fam.)  3. ich Liebe dich ( etwas besonderes sagt man nur wenn man es wirklich so meint LIEBEN)|`|e61b4edb37f4eb34161f1218ab71f47caa	hab dich lieb sagt man zu menschen die man platonisch liebt.ich liebe dich,das sagt man seiner grossen liebe.|`|75ecd6b0b4974abef9955e218f7e30ffaa	ich hab dich lieb sag man zu leute aus der familie und ich ichn  liebe dich zu seinen freund!!!!!!!!!! gru? nancy|`|864f4731d9ecc04d81f581783d130bf2aa	Ich glaube die W?rter " ich liebe dich" sind nur fr die Person die du liebst bestimmt. und fr Freunde nimmt man " hab dich lieb" .|`|25f8476ebbc11fa933847216d57922d2aa	Nein haben sie nicht. *Ich liebe dich* bedeutet, dass man jemanden liebt. so wie eine Frau und ein Mann. *Ich mag Dich* dagegen bedeutet, dass man jemanden nur mag.

10e4d0217c4ee76bf34a8217fd33b1bbaa	My husband of eight years does the same, and yes it does make you feel like a sex object.  Do they not pay attention to our other attributes such as our mind?  I would ask him what attracted him to you after you have been dating a bit longer.  If all he can come up with is that you are sexy...I would be careful, he is not that dedicated and maybe a little shallow if your looks are the most important thing to him.|`|940bb77e969c28fe7d84db7181def4e5aa	yeah well i dont think he thinks of you as more than a sex object. I mean i call my girlfriend sexy... but i first called her cute often, and fun, etc. then eventually beautiful, then sexy when i felt kinda "in the mood"...|`|bb8d60a3bfab8ade47e940fe945a0a7daa	If you just met then that may be what he thinks of you as.  Until he gets to know you that is how most guys think.  But just because he says you're sexy doesn't mean he doesn't think you are beautiful, fun, etc.  Let the relationship grow a little and then you should be able tell what reason he likes you.|`|AA11644444	UMMM YEAH!!!!!!!|`|AA11025896	what ever floats your boat.

If that's the case, try to hang out with her a little more often than  you do.  Not in a 'date' setting, but in a casual setting.  Be it in groups, or just a very informal activity.

She may be going through a rough time with something on her mind and may be projecting it on you when really she needs you to have patience, understanding, less drama, and maybe for you to be her best friend too. On the other hand maybe she needs a little space. Not from you but I have been this way w/ my man and I like to withdrawl and blame him for the same things about. Good luck and if you two love each other then keep the lines of communication open and make sure you both let each other know every single day bad or good that you love them and say three nice things at least a day.

Seja mais direto e diga que n?o est feliz com essa atitude dela e que gostaria de saber o que est acontecendo. Ponha algo em dvida, tenha atitude.  Outra coisa, n?o fique dizendo que a ama. Guarde isso por um tempo, vc n?o precisa dizer algo que ela j est cansada de saber, mas deixa ela sentir falta a ponto de ter dvidas em rela??o ao sentimento que vc demonstra a ela. Ela n?o pode ter sempre essa certeza. O silncio dela deve se d por ela estar se sentindo segura em rela??o a vc, como se tivesse certeza absoluta que vc  algo garantido e que vc n?o terminaria com ela (tipo, "ah! eu fa?o isso, mas EU SEI que ele n?o vai me deixar pq ele me ama.").  Quanto ao sexo, primeiro vc sabe se ela  virgem?  Provavelmente sim, n?o ? Bom, se realmente for, antes que vcs transem de fato, vcs tm que se previnirem, ela precisa ir ao mdico e saber dos devidos cuidados. s vezes ela ainda n?o se sente segura, tem medo de engravidar, etc... E qnto a vc dizer a ela que est afim, primeiro vc tem que analisar se  com ela que vc quer mesmo ficar. E se  com vc mesmo que ela quer ficar e se  para vc que ela quer se "entregar", isso  uma situa??o pesarosa. Ela tem que ter certeza do que est fazendo para que n?o se arrependa mais tarde, caso suspeite que vc quer apenas isso com ela (os homens em geral valorizam mais as mulheres virgens e, embora tenham esse comportamento, assim que conseguem algo "pulam fora") e que o relacionamento possa n?o durar. Vc tbm n?o pode pression-la. Tem que ser carinhoso, principalmente se for a primeira vez dela. Nada de ficar nervoso caso ela n?o queira, tudo tem seu tempo.  Antes de vc falar algo, fiquem a ss, tente beij-la com mais carinho e com outras inten??es, caso ela permita e prolongue,  sinal de que ela quer. Caso ela n?o permita, pode ser a quest?o da dvida. A que vc entra no assunto. Pergunta a ela "Pq n?o? Eu GOSTO de vc e vc diz que tbm gosta de mim, N?O  VERDADE?".A ela vai ter que dizer alguma coisa e vc diz que n?o  de "hoje" que tem notado a indiferen?a dela e gostaria de saber o motivo. Mas o importante  n?o for?ar a barra. Mas, antes de tudo isso, tente fazer ela sentir FALTA de vc. Se vc vai  casa dela todas as sextas, os sbados e domingos, passe a ir somente no sbado ou algo parecido. Espero ter ajudado em algo.

Teens deal with acne everyday, so if that one guy you have your eye on does'nt like you because of your acne, then he's not worth your time.

The vagina is a muscle-it contracts and expands as needed. After childbirth, it takes longer for it to contract back to its "almost" original size-but it does shrink back to normal. Women with kids still use tampons-you know those tiny pieces of cotton as big around as your finger?     after birthing a child the size of a watermelon.     Take that as a lesson-no you cant tell. Womens bodies are made to adapt.

Segundo: Colocando-a de castigo, mostre a ela o porque deste castigo, mostre o que ela fez de errado e ensine-a a maneira correta que ela deveria ter agido.  Um conselho: Bater, vai doer na hora, e depois a dor passa, uma puni??o, como deixando ela sem fazer o que gosta por 1 semana por exemplo, far ela perceber que se ela fizer o errado ficar sem o que mais gosta de fazer.

"thanks for taking out the trash".   "hey, you went to school today, awesome".  but don't gush either.  it's going to annoy him and probably drive him the other way if you go on and on - "I'm so proud of you that you did this and this and I called your aunt and told her you're finally turning around and blah blah blah".    take him on one of those talk shows that does segments on "bad kids" or even just write to them (Maury and Sally are two that love this).  They can point you in the right direction even if you don't want to necessarily go on national TV.   but bear in mind they usually pay all your expenses to go and also would pay for therapy, counseling, boot camp or whatever it would take to get him straightened out.    best of luck, and keep us updated.|`|02b7ae09923b764789417637fa0a3211aa	its' never too late if you try and if he has a good heart and loves his family deep down inside. it might take some work but it's never too late.|`|ca0530892e28195391421161648e41aeaa	sounds like dope to me.

Felicidade  olhar para hoje e ver que o que voc  hoje foi resultado de suas escolhas no passado, e que o que voc vai ser amanh? ser o resultado de suas escolhas de hoje.     Felicidade  saber que voc  quem decide sobre sua vida, e n?o vive algo imposto por outros. Quem voc tem responsabilidades, mas que voc define como vai cumpri-las.     Felicidade  saber que sua presen?a torna outras pessoas mais felizes, que seu abra?o faz bem a algum, que as pessoas sorriem quando voc est perto.  sentir que  amado.     Felicidade  estar perto das pessoas que voc gosta, sem sufoc-las.  poder estar longe delas e ainda estar em paz, por saber que elas est?o no seu cora??o, e voc est no cora??o delas, n?o importa a distancia ou o tempo.

Ela nos torna capazes de enfrentar as dificuldades da vida, pois sabemos que depois olharemos para trs e veremos o que aconteceu como um desafio vencido.     Felicidade  ser dono do prprio nariz,  as pessoas respeitarem as escolhas uma das outras. N?o  feliz quem  dominado, e nem quem quer dominar a vontade e o desejo dos outros.     Felicidade  n?o julgar, mas ouvir, compreender e aconselhar.     Para ser feliz, imagine um mundo em que voc pudesse fazer o que quisesse, e qual seria sua escolha em cada situa??o.

As regras s?o fantasias na cabe?a das pessoas. As regras foram feitas por pessoas, para pessoas, e n?o as pessoas que foram feitas para as regras. Quebre ou ignore as regras quando necessrio.     A felicidade est em sorrir ao lado de quem se ama, e ver o sorriso no rosto de quem voc gosta. Por isso as pessoas gostam de festas. Todas as pessoas que voc gosta reunidas e sorrindo.     Ajude, aconselhe, brinque, d um sorriso em todos os momentos. Apie, seja honesto com seus sentimentos, n?o engane as pessoas. Respeite e seja respeitado. Fa?a o que puder para ver outras pessoas felizes. A felicidade vir como um jato dgua num dia de calor.

6af6a944879bfa606f0daa6a2865fb85aa	Te mando stos juegos que ya los he puesto como tres veces.....Ojala y te guste alguno... Suerte!  LOTERA NUPCIAL  Es sencillsimo hacer una lotera de novios a travs de la computadora. Y si eres dise?adora grfica o conoces alguna, pues mejor.   Piensa en por lo menos 30 palabras relacionadas con la boda (de preferencia ms de 50), como pastel, pala y cuchillo, lbum, arras, lazo, liga, velo, vestido, zapatos, tiara, ramo... y con stas dise?a cartas de 9 cuadros o de los que t quieras.  Imprmelas en papel y pgalas en cartn u otro material duro. Luego forma tu baraja.  Si te quieres pulir, puedes dise?ar o dibujar los elementos para que no slo sean palabras y tu lotera quede ms ilustrada y vistosa.  CRUCIGRAMA DE BODA  Tambin puedes valerte de la computadora para armar un crucigrama sencillo de palabras verticales, horizontales y diagonales, de temas relacionados con la boda o los novios.  La que lo termine primero correctamente, ser la triunfadora.   QU TANTO TE CONOCEN TUS AMIGAS  Este juego es como un test personal y crelo, descubrirs quines te conocen bien y vers que no siempre son las que pensaste.  Tambin te ayudar a darte cuenta de tus virtudes y defectos. ?Ya vers! Te sorprendern los resultados.  Quien conteste acertadamente el mayor nmero de preguntas, ser la ganadora.

Fecha de nacimiento   ? ?Cul es tu color favorito?   ? ?Cul es tu artista favorito?   ? ?Qu es lo que ms te gusta?   ? ?Qu es lo que ms te disgusta?   ? ?Comida favorita?   ? ?Qu coleccionas?   ? ?De qu color son tus ojos?   ? Tu principal virtud es...   ? Tu principal defecto...   LLUVIA DE RECETAS  Lo ms probable es que seas inexperta en el arte culinario, as que una buena idea para incrementar tus conocimientos y para tener un bonito recuerdo de quienes asistieron a tu despedida, es pedirles una receta.   Cuando les des la invitacin para tu despedida, ponles una tarjetaen blanco para receta para que la llenen y te la entreguen en la fiesta. Colctalas y colcalas en una cajita especial.   Voten entre todas por cul es la mejor receta para que surja la ganadora.  PIZARRN DE FOTOS  Este juego es divertidsimo. Consigue fotografas de tu novio y tuyas y de sus familias (paps, hermanos, primos...) de cuando eran bebs o tenas 5 a?os o eran adolescentes, pero que no se parezcan en nada a como son hoy; y colcalas en un pizarrn, en la fiesta.   Pon un nmero debajo de cada foto y dale a las invitadas un papel para que adivinen quin es cada persona. Si sientes que no tendrn idea de quines sern o no se saben los nombres, coloca al lado de las fotos una lista con los nombres de los implicados.   VESTIDO DE NOVIA DE PAPEL  Este juego lleva a?os y lo siguen haciendo porque es muy divertido y todas se ren a carcajadas.  Divide grupos de 5 personas (o ms dependiendo del nmero de invitadas).

Vielleicht macht alleine diese Tatsache es aus, dass ?ltere sich oft im Recht sehen.  Was natrlich nicht immer stimmt.    Dann ist es oft auch so, dass sich ?ltere Menschen nicht vortsellen k?nnen, dass jemand Jngeres Recht haben k?nnte...er ist ja jnger und somit unreifer...auch oft ein Irrtum!    Ich denke da hilft oft eine kl?rende, freundliche Unterhaltung, damit die ?ltere Generation nicht glaubt, die Jungen pfeifen auf ihre Erfahrung (denn man kann auch davon PROVITIEREN),  und die ?lteren mssen auch von ihrer Seite mehr Toleranzen aufbringen um auch einmal auf jngere Menschen zuzugehen und zugeben, dass auch SIE von DENEN lernen k?nnen    Das Zauberwort hei?t TOLERANZ!|`|c250890c0b5d741188b62c6f19c185bbaa	Erfolg ist das Ergebnis , von richtigen Entscheidungen ....

If the child wants to he/she can petition for the support if they are living on there own. This is a good question for the child support agency.    good luck.

AA12067875	Jealosy in either a male or female is a form of fear of abandonement and insecurity. Hollywood in particular (inc Popeye the Sailor and Bluto-Brutus fighting over OliveOil) taught many people in this culture during the 50s and 60s that this is a desireable trait in a male. It is NOT a sign that he really cares!! Don't be duped by this! Many battered women have thought that a man who is real possessive like this is showing his depth of interest and love!! NO, it is not!!! It is a potential warning sign of a batterer.  It is essentially a warning sign that predicts future problems for that couple.  Walk the other way.  Find someone who is not possessive, clingy, a control freak or afraid of abandonment! Look up "the lethality checklist" on line to see other traits of potentially abusive men (or women)|`|AA10324322	are you kidding? woman can be just as crazy as us men with jealousy. they can fight and even kill. in fact, i heard on the news a girl killed a girl over a man.  in answer to your question, it is never a good thing for anyone to be jealous. it is good for people to be secure and not insecure. also, there MUST be trust. if the two people really love each other, and are really in love(and there is nothing lacking in either partner), and the partners are mature, understanding, secure and have no self esteem issues, then there would be no jealousy.  who said that men alone can be harmful?|`|AA12056721	Yes.

Expectancy is the key. 9:30-10 is ok, and dont act desperate or needy. Girls dont like that.
643ee1269def6ad84a2ad8450e860581aa	If this is someone you see at work or at least ofter, you need to start slowly.  The first time just give her a shy smile and walk by.  Each day you see this woman look into her eyes and smile.  After a few days start to say "Hello" as you pass and see how she responds.  You slowly work up to things like "Here were are again" when you see her.  Eventually you feel more confident and will be able to talk to her.    For someone who you may not see on a regulare basis you may need to try something else.  First is the eye contact.  You want to make sure you see her and connect from across the room the first time.  The distance will allow you to feel a little more secure.  Glance at her once in a while - don't stare.  When her eyes meet yours, don't drop your eyes.  Look deeply into hers for a few seconds, then turn away.  If you drop your eyes it whill show you are shy, and you are trying to get over this!  Every few minutes look at her again.  If she is returning your glances, she is open to communicating with you.  Now it is up to you to move a bit closer to her.  See if she is still following you with her eyes.  If so, you are ready to move up to her and ask her if she would like to dance, drink, talk, what ever is going on where you are at the time.      Here is the best trick that everyone needs to know about overcoming your shyness.  Ask the woman questions about herself.  Not really personal questions, but general questions that she would not be afriad to answer.  People love to tell you about themselves.  If you ask questions and she talks the whole time, you don't have to worry about being shy and she will think you are the one man on Earth who really listens to a woman!    Some safe questions:  Have you seen any good movies lately?  Have you read and books that you would recommend?  Are you a (insert the name of a band, sports team, TV show) fan?    I am incredibly shy, and this helps me talk to new people.|`|4f8d695506e63827675a35dff9514c3faa	im gonna wait because these anwsers are gonna help me too|`|b798eb653f704110034f13e6b1feafe7aa	just be yourself! go up to her and start talking to her. tell her that you've noticed how pretty she was and you wanted to get to know a beautiful women like her! then start talking and give her your number! be sure to get her number too!|`|af7f0b1fd0970e051744a33c95131bb9aa	Just focus that the worst that can happen is that nothing happens at all. Just go there and do it!! It is surprising how many women are glad to have a pleasant level of attention paid to them. Confidence is the key!! Show some of it to her!!    But some extra hints:  a) Don't gawp (no no at the chest level)  b) Don't drool  c) Buy a Porsche as a security investment (actually that doesn't work. Had a $150,000 car for two years and did not attract the ladies, not for the money I splashed out. Went back to the dealer to complain they forgot to install the "chick-magnet" button.      Good luck!!  P.S. Yeah, I am a guy and this was for the ladies. Sue me for giving good advice!!|`|262a1999a3450c3e48a79ff22939f365aa	Just walk up and introduce yourself. If she's interested, she'll face you, look you in the eye, and introduce herself, and chat. If she's not, she'll try to ignore you, but don't take it personally. Everyone, and I really do mean everyone, gets turned down *most* of the time.    I've always liked guys who were just straight forward and honest in their interest. Politeness is big with me, too.    Just say hi, make an obvious comment about what caught your eye about her, or maybe what she was doing or looking at, in a played down kind of way. The real key is keeping it relaxed and non-threatening. I've always had good luck with pretending like you've known the person all your life.    If it doesn't work out, then move on gracefully. People say no to you all the time about all kinds of things. One more "no" during the day isn't going to make much of a difference, right?    People say that "I love you" is the hardest thing to say in the English language, but I don't agree. The hardest thing to say is hi to a complete stranger that you think you'd like to get to know. But practice makes perfect, as the saying goes.|`|ea942d729d0001e7a342da10168e0a6aaa	never come out with a line i like men who will talk to me at coffee shops and bus stops like joke about things if some ones on there own reading ask say how long has the bus been or do you mind if i sit hear so i don't look alone oh BTW what you reading stuff like that. make a girl laf and shell be interested from the start unless of course shes in a relationship or not interested in which case you can just say OK fair enough just making polite convo to pass the time :) oh yeh and add well its been nice talking to someone interesting did you wana maybe swap details and we can do this again ?|`|4ea6ef3eceb360e51725b9454a99a7a8aa	A compliment always work not a stupid one neither one that would make a lady smile

Em Portugal 50% dos casamentos s?o frutos dos namoros virtuais. No Brasil o namoro virtual ainda sofre certa resistncia, embora aos poucos, as pessoas estejam aceitando.  Eu aprovo o namoro virtual deste que sejam praticados por pessoas adultas (fisicamente e mentalmente) e que os dois comecem a agir para que o namoro logo se transforme em real.

Prima di prendere qualunque decisione analizza bene i pro e i contro. Qualunque cosa deciderai sar una sofferenza, per questo scegli il male minore. La famiglia, i figli, la stabilit da un lato e dall'altro l'intrigo, la novit e il ritorno della vita.  Prova ad andare con la mente oltre il presente e analizza quale futuro si prospetta.  Falla adesso la tua scelta prima che sia troppo tardi rischi di perdere entrambe le cose.|`|bdd10f62de0dfee6b4856af4c184c65caa	Non posso dirti se separarti o meno, ma mi sembra che il tuo matrimonio sia in crisi da parecchio ormai. Non farlo se non sei sicuro di cosa sta accadendo tra te e tua moglie, se non sei sicuro che tutto tra voi sia davvero finito. L'altra donna (che brutto termine) ha 31 anni, il che ne fa una donna matura. Solo che anche le donne mature a volte mentono. Solo tu puoi sapere se  innamorata o no. Io credo lo sia, ma non posso garantire, ovviamente. Purtroppo  una tua decisione.|`|e7d1d6ca276146cdadedd9d84484e08aaa	Non voglio fare la bacchettona della situazione, ma perch prima di intraprendere una storia parallela non hai cercato di capire che cosa ti spingeva fuori dal matrimonio e non hai provato a risolvere la situazione con tua moglie?  Faccio questa domanda senza sapere tutte le retrospettive che ci sono in questa storia, ma penso fermamente che i matrimoni debbano essere salvaguardati lottando con le unghie e con i denti, da entrambe le parti!!!  Quindi credo che forse faresti meglio a parlare a tua moglie e cercare di salvare il salvabile, sempre che tu ci tenga, diversamente la tua scelta l' hai gi fatta, hai voltato le spalle al tuo matrimonio, puoi decisamente concludere la faccenda andando fino in fondo.  Il fatto che ora tu non stia bene in famiglia mi suona di pi come un alibi ad hoc per dire: "ho fatto la cosa giusta, lei mi capisce e con lei sto meglio".  Ma chi ti dice che sia veramente cos?  Ultima cosa, non  neanche giusto che tu non prenda nessuna decisione, troppo comodo!!!

Essere moglie (e avere dei figli) non  una cosa leggera. E' probabile che arrivando a casa dal lavoro non sia sempre tutto rose e fiori e tu subisca questa situazione.  Ovvio che un'amante la trovi sempre disponibile, ci puoi parlare e lei ti ascolta e non ti rompe. Ma la quotidianit  un'altra cosa e quindi lasciando la famiglia corri il rischio di rendere infelici un sacco di persone te compreso. Lascia l'amante e cerca di recuperare un rapporto che magari si  deteriorato.

Credere ad una donna che dice di amarti non dovrebbe essere un problema, se la ami anche tu. Quanto a separarti per questo, tu stesso sei molto confuso. Devi capire perche` non stai bene in famiglia, perche` ti sembra di subire la vita; peraltro e` poco chiaro il significato di subire, se non che ti senti soffocato, e questo e` certamente un fattore pesante. Ma la tua finale, se intesa correttamente, dice che non vuoi prendere decisioni che altri potrebbero rinfacciarti ( e` questo quello che vuoi dire?) per vigliaccheria. La domanda spontanea e`: ma tu ti senti soffocato o ti lasci soffocare? Perche` dovresti preoccuparti di quello che ti rinfaccerebbero gli altri, se tu non te ne fai una ragione e non concludi che non hai nulla da rinfacciarti? Questo e` il punto che devi chiarire con te stesso e con chi vive vicino a te, senza dare peso alle morali imposte da altri. E` la tua morale che ti deve accusare se accuse ne senti in cuore, altrimenti soffochi davvero e per sempre. Dopo questo vedrai che anche gli altri saranno piu` disposti a lasciarti felice per la tua strada. Diversamente rischi di traslocare con il rimorso di una decisione non ben ponderata nei suoi aspetti.|`|791ab2b498bd67674f67264afdaf0ae8aa	si separati poi solo tu puoi capire se dice sul serio o no..x non  giusto ke continui a stare con una donna ke non ami,almeno si rif una vita anke lei..|`|44fed05f03de4877729132bdfabb3776aa	tienila come amante e se lei continua ad amarti te ne accorgerai da solo ma niente decisioni affrettate ciao

61eecb8fb87303dac494001ef4a08a7daa	Yes, this is a common DIY problem faced by many homeowners with roosting places for bats.    On balance, I would say yes, go with the wooden stake, as long as enough care is taken in selecting a durable, good quality hardwood, and it is sealed properly with a polyurethane-based varnish (minimum three coats).    I have had much success with maple stakes coated with Ronseal 'Mahogany & Garlic'.    Good luck!

2a23880bb6f3b2da2f225df3166ae031aa	C' un modo molto semplice per ovviare alla solitudine.  Farsi degli amici. E' pi semplice di quello che credi. Anzitutto pensa che se tu sei timido, moltissimi altro lo sono ancora di pi.  Quindi parla per primo con gli altri e vedrai che saranno contenti di conoscerti. Poi iscriviti ad una scuola di ballo o ad una palestra. Conoscerai su sacco di gente con la quale comunicare.  Incomincia a leggere i giornali, magare da Internet, per poter avere sempre pronti argomenti di conversazione.  Infine, e pi importante di tutto, pensa in positivo. Pensa che da oggi  la tua vita cambier in meglio. Che le persone che incontri ti vedono con piacere ed aspettano un tuo cenno per conoscerti meglio. Tu cerca sempre di essere te stesso, senza fingerti diverso da quello che sei. Se incontri la ragazza che ti piace, dille apertamente che ti piace parlare con lei ma che sei timido. La timidezza non  una cosa di cui vergognarsi, fa parte della giovent. Sar lei che si aprir con te e sar la tua migliore amica.|`|5e3347465fa3c6140e1dbab0bb7e5029aa	qui difficilemnte trovi gente raccomandabile. ti conviene uscire un po e trovare qualche gruppetto con cui uscire. ce ne sono tanti in giro prova a cercare|`|af966ff523fd234c374b5b30ec3d2d4caa	concordo pienamente con daniele.|`|c6370f0417004457b58c8fdbbbd414f8aa	ragazzo timido non credi che e decisamente meglio se esci e cerchi di socializzare con qualcuno?qui sopra chi speri di trovare????esci e goditi la vita piu che puoi|`|7769c27cd55bc573ea27fb7ada1a68f3aa	peccato ke nn ho msn...non puoi chattare via mail su yahoo???? quanti anni hai?|`|6d1b0b6f45f380d1ab46f2492f1d4f7eaa	Un vero timido non osa nemmeno proporre una richiesta come la tua...........secono me sei un furbacchione...................oppure la tua  vergogna ma non timidezza.Per cui la dovresti elaborare da un nuovo punto di vista.

AA11985067	Well we live in NY so I am not sure if the laws, etc are different. However I can tell you that though we adopted two of our kids in different countries, we adopted them when we got back to the USA!!! We went through the County courts! : ) So try that, but I am sure you can also get help from an adoption lawyer, it would probably be worth it, to make sure it is all done right! Good luck!

Penney's make scents so I am told, you could find me under your nose. (the cologne/perfume section)    I could be called a psychic store by the name that I bear, you'll find a clue next to the boxers I wear. (Sears lingerie/underwear dept)    Watch your step! Pick up your feet, your next clue is by the other white meat. (Chic-Fil-A)    Shh! Don't tell anyone where I might linger to, for Vicky would get mad if she caught me next to her shoe.

But gradually with the passage of time and personality development, everything became clear. U can also fetch those excellent adjectives for u like supreme, very intelligent, mobile encyclopedia, creative and many more.

I spent lots of time and did a city/regional one in/around Baltimore. It was sooo much fun. (If you're ever visiting baltimore, let me know, I'll send you the clue sheet. It would be awesome as a tourist event.) I later bought a cheap book that has instant hunts ready to go. The book was ok, if you want to entertain kids, but I'd recommend using your noggin to add creativity.   I always thought it would be more fun to have riddles and puzzles in the hunt, not just find x, y, and z. Tho you should have a small component of that too. Think about people getting stumped and how you can score it. I had a race component that included riddles and doing research ahead of time, then a free-for-all component that allowed them to take their time finding stuff. Then, make your finale a challenge to find you! You give hints and hide somewhere in the mall...somewhere you can wrap up the game with all the players.  Have fun!|`|9fd2003f3b0a549e7370a0b5bfac90f4aa	Cant help you with the clues but can give you advise.     Start making clues backward from the goal.    Have a common theme in all the clues.    Try taking help from the store people if you can.    It would be good to keep the goal close to the second clue.    Try making the players ponder over the clues rather than give a pointer eg. for a clue in a potted plant near the rest-room, 'Nature calls, and d the clue calls it too' (well its dumb but the best that i can come up with right now)    Well, all the best, and do take photos of the players in action, it can lead to a good album

1030284050248bce2b815da5bb209408aa	No, you should have who you want in your wedding party.  My personal opinion though, if you are close with your siblings it is lovely b/c you know that 10 years from now when you are looking at your wedding pictures you'd like to see faces of ppl who are still in your life.  It also depends on the size of your wedding party.  If you have very close friends that you would like to stand up for you there are other jobs you can have to include your siblings.  They could do a special reading at the ceremony, if they can sing you could have them sing at the ceremony.  You could also have your siblings co-MC the reception.      Try not to let family pressure you into doing things you don't want to. I spent so much time trying to make sure my family and my in-laws were happy that I ended up making myself sick b/f the wedding.  I ended up with a stomach disorder caused by stress and couldn't drink champagne at the wedding and had to eat a bland dinner with Gatorade!      Enjoy the planning and let ppl know gently that it is your wedding.    Good luck and God Bless!|`|26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	Nope!  Your bridal party should consist of the people you feel closest to, who you want to stand up for you at your wedding, who support and love you the most.      One of my sisters has already told me that she doesn't want to be asked to be in my bridal party when I get married.  She wants to be able to enjoy the event and my happiness, and she doesn't think she'd be able to do so as a bridesmaid.  (Also the fact that she's older than me makes me think she just doesn't want to be bothered!  *laughing*)  Out of all my siblings, I would really only want my brother to be in my wedding party cuz we're very close.|`|813a80415c474e102e2187afee926d67aa	If you are close to them, then yes.  Otherwise, it's your day so choose who you want in your bridal party.|`|5469751313af7a6e651dc1f8eb0620adaa	I won't think it a requirement, more so a preference. just depends on how you feel towards your siblings.|`|123bae771e240e3462a9113441e3358aaa	no - it would be nice to include them as far as guest sign in attendents or something but it is your day and you do not have to ask anyone that you do not want up there.|`|AA10512937	Not technically a requirement, but in some circles they would think it peculiar if you did not have any siblings in your wedding party. They might think you have some kind of family rift.|`|ebd4aaa69ea6d6b974cba29f3e113cf8aa	No, of course not.  There are no rules when it comes to weddings these days.  If you're not close to him/her why would you want them in your party.  It's your wedding...Have who you want and not what anyone else says.  I'm planning on having my best guy friend to stand up with me since my boyfriend IS my best friend.  My bf is planning on having his best female friend since I'm HIS best friend.|`|AA11943775	Its not a requirement. Your wedding party is usually composed of the people that are closest to the couple. If the sibling is close to the bride or groom, then go for it. If they don't want to part of the wedding party, they can take on another role, such as host/hostess, decorator, or help with other tasks. It is up to the couple and the sibling. Some siblings want to take an active role, while others just want to enjoy the wedding.|`|e3e752201a87d925332256376ac4537faa	I didnt have a wedding party, my ceremony was small at a park with our parents and siblings. My sister got a corsage and we picked a dress out that she could wear that day that was like a bridesmaids dress and was the colors of the wedding. We also went and got our nails and hair and make-up done together|`|AA11779322	Because my Dad wasnt in my life Im having my brothers walk me down the isle and my fiancee is having 2 of his brothers as groomsmen.

Remember, the day is ALL ABOUT YOU and your Fiance - but mostly the bride (haha).  You want to be happy and do that by surrounding yourself with people and things you love and that make you happy!!!  Good luck and enjoy!!!|`|02193ede75ee3b7624bc729246de5c61aa	why not? you want to have pictures of everyone at your wedding date!!!!! think about 10 years from now. what do you see in your photo album??|`|2ca48bc4e34dad8693c78d56ae437f1baa	it's your wedding you choose who you want to be in your wedding.
30ca8acf5cd7d0725b115378f2c5ba39aa	Sometimes it never shows but I would say 6-12 months.  Depends on how much time you spend together.|`|f7970eb8785c70a3cd88d512c88578e6aa	it depends once they feel comfortable enough with you then they should open up more. but its gotta be up to them whenever they let their guard down.|`|689fee30aa691e73a951d88d6a25d1b4aa	It varies.  I was with a woman for 7 years before she revealed her true nature... and let me tell you, it was no bueno!|`|AA12056721	three-five months when they begin to get comfortable with you, or atleast till you spend the night

This is your life! God put you here for a Special Reason--so find that reason...Me, my whole focus is on my career and the things I want out of life, and God. This makes men like and respect me 200 times more than desperate clingy women. Read about Betty Broderick, and dont end up like her!

It's called smothering.    As much as someone might love you, people do need alone time, private space. It's natural.     Also, sometimes a significant other is more interesting when they have outside interests that you do not. Gives you both something to talk about. Even if it's just a book that you read and he did not.    There is something to be said for leaving a person wanting. Top comics are known for leaving the stage at the high point of their act. They may have more material but may exit early leaving the audience wanting more.

AA10512937	Wedding gifts are never mandatory. However, it would be considerate if you at least got a small gift.    Btw, gifts should NOT be brought to the wedding, you should ship them to the bride's home either before, or shortly after the wedding.    The "cover your own plate" thing is a HUGE etiquette MYTH so feel free to ignore it. The very concept that a gift is "in exchange for" being a guest is vulgar. People gift because they want to, and gift as large as small as they are financially able to and based on their affection for the couple.|`|3d0e6f34119f12ff42022c6b966256c9aa	If they are feeding you, you should bring a gift.|`|f3c05c4f9299be81924ff5b2a2d8bd99aa	i feel its a good gesture to at least bring the cash.  a gift might be too personal since you do not know the bride and groom.    its good manners too.|`|d904087f8544a513a45d6b874199f65caa	give them a gift certificate. its nice and not overly friendly, but not cheap.|`|ab398fcda092215b6b45a19e504ea21caa	You and your date should sign a nice wedding card and both put money in it.|`|AA11610212	yes, you should give a little something.  a card and cash is good since you dont know them.  i'd say $30 to $50 is good.|`|AA12100644	Ok, any time you are invited to a wedding, you bring a gift.

Then you should bring a card and put 10 dollars in it.  It isn't much, but it's something simple.  Otherwise, sometimes what I like to do if I don't know a couple very well is buy them a cheap fun game that two people can play (yahtzee, head to head poker, life, sorry, trouble anything cheap)  Or check out if they have a gift registry at target and see if they have any games on it or movies that are cheap.  I never pick kitchenware because I think it's boring, and if you want to make a good impression, 10 dollars or a fun game is perfect.    Not too much, and not too little.|`|2b5a97fd4c75f735faeda40071b6a8feaa	cash. for the food about 50 will do|`|2c0249b5ab2ccd92ca98aa7a1b784d6eaa	Very nice of you to think of these things!  I don't think there is anything tacky about asking your date: r "What do you think your sister and her fiance would like as a wedding gift? Are they registered?"  This should prompt your date to say one of two things:    "Oh no, don't worry about a gift.  The gift I give will be from the both of us. (But how sweet of you to ask!)"    OR    "Well, she's registered at (wherever)" Or she'll tell you to just bring cash.      I think this is the most tactful way to determine if your date is going to provide the gift or if you should as well.  Typically, a "couple" gives one gift together - not separate gifts. My boyfriend (now fiance) always made it clear to me that he provided the (cash) gift when I was his guest and I always provided the gift when he was my guest at a wedding.|`|1982384ec24feec1010c44e7453ca848aa	I could not understand your problem exactly but being a muslim we consider that giving gifts to each other increases love amoung us and it BRIDGES THE GAPS. :)    DONT HASITATE TO GIVE A GIFT.|`|AA10663412	In your case I would ask your date if there is a gift that her sister would like, that would open the discussion up, if she does suggest going together with her then yes I would bring a card with some cash in it - your right, at least the appropriate amount to cover your plate/booze. Have fun at the wedding.

AA10246903	try zabasearch.com, which is free. If you have no luck there- try a social security number search through us search- the cost is about $60, and they will keep searching periodically if you do not locate him- they helped me find my dad that i had not seen in 15+ years. They also checked back with me to see if i had located him.....good luck.  oh- and also keep in mind that he may be incarcerated- in that case he will not show up on any of those searches- those are public records- when in jail or prison system the individual has actually been removed from society- so that could be very well the reason you cannot locate him. Contact the State department of corrections- for Texas- or he may be a federal inmate, or was. In either case it would be documented and maybe he is out and on probation- which would make it really easy for you to find his exact whereabouts and get in touch with him.

Abrace muito, beije mais ainda e ria, j que a vida  de gra?a.  Pe?a - sempre haver algum quem lhe dar do que voc est precisando.  Despe?a-se do que j passou - quem vive de passado  museu.  Pare de se preocupar. Suas desgra?as nunca ser?o do tamanho que voc pensa. Nem seus xitos.  Perdoe-se por suas burrices e fracassos. Se voc n?o se perdoar, vai ser intil pedir desculpas ou dizer "sinto muito" a quem quer que seja.  Reze para agradecer, nunca para pedir. Voc j recebeu mais do que o suficiente para crescer e ser feliz.  N?o perca tempo em discuss?es inteis. Ao invs de brigar, cante uma can??o do Roberto, tome um banho frio ou v dar uma volta de bicicleta no parque.  Desista de fazer a cabe?a dos outros - o que eles pensam de voc n?o  da sua conta. Adote a filosofia do CAVALO NA PARADA DE 7 DE SETEMBRO:  "cagando, andando e sendo aplaudido".   Cuide de si mesmo como se estivesse cuidando do seu melhor amigo.  Expresse a sua individualidade. Transe a sua sexualidade. Apie-se em seus talentos e virtudes. Concentre-se em seus objetivos.   Pare de fumar, e fa?a ginstica trs vezes por semana, no mnimo. Mude algo em si mesmo todos os dias. Abra-se com algum.  Fa?a alguma coisa que sempre desejou fazer, que pode fazer, mas  que tinha vergonha.  Cometa erros novos.   Simplifique sua vida.  Deixe bagun?ado.  Pare de frescura.  Acredite no amor; nada no mundo  mais digno de crdito. AME - n?o  vexame nenhum.  Nunca pense que o amor  uma "gua morna" - onde h amor, h respeito pelas diferen?as; onde as diferen?as s?o aceitas, existem pontos de vista contrrios; e onde existem pontos de vista contrrios, h conflitos e desentendimentos.  N?o se intrometa na vida dos outros, nem julgue as pessoas de jeito nenhum.

If the love isn't shared equally, then it feels like your doing all the work, and therefore one starts believing they are "whipped" When the truth is, the other person doesn't love them equally.

Too in love?   I wonder why you ask? If you are being manipulated  into behaving in a manner that you are not comfortable with, the person you lov e is not loving you but controlliong you. Don't allow yourself to be a doormat for anyone. You ha ve to be getting as much from a relationship as you give to it. Otherwise it is out of balance and you will eventually become resentful and very unahppy.

Are you just looking for guys to brag about their sexual prowess? Cause you're going to get lots of that.    Are you looking for techniques for yourself? Like how to get your man to satisfy you? If so, show him. Nothing sexier than a woman who knows what she wants and asks for it.    Or are you just looking for a generic answer to a philosophical question? If so, the answer is, "Read the signs. A woman doesn't have to say something to give direction. Her body language will tell you plenty."|`|361858e3b7f21a517622c6ce0b2d170baa	I don't think so how do you do that?|`|79577cfaf70dbf39cc778d88a8ede2f0aa	I sure know how to do that and lots more!|`|AA12317623	No, I don't leave her begging for more, I don't stop until she is satisfied.|`|59bbb2f1494741065d97108f8cfc2b37aa	lick , tease, and taste every inch of her body and when you come to her "sweet spot" orallay make love to and **** it with your mouth and fingers and tongue|`|AA10024135	Weak in knees, yes.

Sooner or later they will find out what is really going on and they will have to accept that they did not listened to you.    Talk to a counselor outside the family (school, church) let them know how do you feel.  They will act on your behalf and both your dad and grandma will have to look into this matter from another perspective.  You can call family service for advice.    I am concerned what would happen if you lose your temper and really hit her back real hard and you hurt her.  If the grown ups are not listening I urge to talk to other grown ups that will.|`|af5b4de68cf98b9ed1a39c0b03216e47aa	it's whoopy time!!~!! who cares wat ur father says. if she doesn't have disipline then, she will still act the way she's acting now!~! she really needs to be disipline, or take her to maury!!!!|`|cd38ba409251d08e31483e83fb255e29aa	i say set up a camera, use a camera phone if you have one, hide it and carry on at the computer, record your sister beating on you then show your dad, then she'l be sooooo BUSTED! plus shes only 5 and shes beatin on you and actually hurting you, god only knows what she'l be like when shes even bigger and stronger, she sounds like she got an angermanagement problem, and needs it sorting out whilst its still in its early stages and of course before it gets any worse|`|b75da8bfec0997e9cd627565f6aef40daa	Call child welfare explane to them what you just did here they will help you your parent need to stop  look and listen is she mean to her friends as well IF she has any good luck hope you get help soon

My ex used to mentally abuse me.  That's what it is you know?  Mental abuse.  Some people say it's worse then physical abuse.  And I believe it could be just as bad.  They drain you of your self esteem.  The reason he does this.  Is he's a control freak.  And he has low self esteem.  He wants to bring you down and hurt you to make himself feel better.  Mine used to say things like your so stupid.  Are you retarted or what.  Just over the silliest things.  I came to find out his father used to do this to him when he was a child.  Just like with physical abuse it usually stems, from something that happened to them or they continually saw happening to someone else.  You deserve so much better!!!  My ex was great in the beginning also.  Treated me like gold.  The was only to get me hooked and then the real person came out.  Please don't stay with him.  You'll only scar yourself.  I was always having to say I was sorry.  This is still with me sometimes, to other people and it's been almost 3 years since we broke up.  Don't be like me, I stayed way to long.  Because I looked at the good qualities he had.  But you know what there aren't any when he mentally abusing you and hurting you so much!!!  From one mental abusee to another please get out!!!!  God Bless You!!!  You derserve so much better!!!!  Someone who will always treat you like gold.  Not like crap on the floor.  I wish you all the best!!!!!  Take care hun!!!!!  Oh and one more thing don't think or convince yourself he's going to change he never will.  He has a mental problem, it will never go away.  Unless maybe he got help but control freaks usually don't because they to controlling to get help.  And they don't think they need it.  He will never ever ever change!!!!  Sorry!!!!  You'll find someone better!!!!|`|553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	Leave him.  Life's too short to waste time on people like that.    They are not worth it.

You deserve better.    Advice to all girls: raise your standards.  If a guy is treating you poorly then move along.  I would give the same advice to a guy was dating a girl that treated him poorly.  Don't stick around because you have feelings for them & don't want to lose their "love" for you.  I'm not saying to dump everyone that makes a mistake.  We need to forgive, show grace, etc.  But, obviously there are times where we just need to see the writing on the wall and break up, move along, etc.

There is nothing worse than a tag-a-long little sister.  What I did, was tell her I would spend time with her in the evenings, about an hour or so, and she could "hang" with me on Sunday afternoons.  The rest of the time I had to spend with my friends, because they needed me too.  She completely understood this and the problem was solved.  She got her time and I got mine!!
af5b4de68cf98b9ed1a39c0b03216e47aa	that's really easy to answer    When your on the phone with them late at night and they hang up you miss them already when it was just two minutes ago  You read their texts over and over again...  You walk really slow when you're with them  You feel shy whenever you're with them...  When you think about them, your heart beats faster and faster  You smile when you hear their voice...  When you look at them, you can't see the other people around  you... all you see is him/her...  You start listening to slow songs, while thinking of them  They become ALL you think about...  You get high just from their scent...  You realize that you're always smiling to yourself when you think about them...  You would do anything for them...

When u hold hands my arm goes numb, and when he kisses me my lips get all tingly, and u just wanna be held onto and never let go of him|`|59b837e90d56d5eccf622f871e0d460baa	Yeah, that seems to be the common answer to your question! Its actually true though! But, here are some other ways to tell. How does this person make you feel?! If he makes you feel very good about yourself it may be love! Also, when you stop thinking about other guys and can't imagine yourself with anyone else, it could be love! If you smile at the mention of his name, it could be love! If you stop thinking about your own needs and start thinking about his well being, then it could be love! But, I have to tell you, when you are "head over heals" in love with someone, you really do just know! It might take a little while to realize this, but if you truly love someone, you really do just know!|`|13c55ecae3672f1a7425b409bcb9da73aa	Damn, I am too late, Sophia D has already answered it.

The principal characters are Lancelot (played by Richard Gere), King Arthur (played by Sean Connery) and Guinevere (Julia Ormond).    The film follows the rogue Lancelot's (played by Richard Gere) romance with Lady Guinevere (played by Julia Ormond) of Leonesse, who is to marry King Arthur (played by Sean Connery) of Camelot. Ben Cross appears as the villain Malagant. The film is notable for its absence of magical elements (like Merlin and Morgan Le Fay), its drawing on the Arthurian material of Chrtien de Troyes rather than Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur for plot elements (Malagant appears in Chrtien's Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart) and the substantial age difference between Arthur and Guinevere.    Director Jerry Zucker made "First Knight" as a follow-up to his Academy Award nominated 1990 hit "Ghost". Previously, he was primarily known for teaming with his brother David Zucker and with Jim Abrahams to create comedies such as "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun".|`|6b915c879510c7065124f626a118c9f2aa	what r u talking about ?|`|86cd355796328defdd6fac740a437acaaa	I guess you might mean FIRST NIGHT, it just sounds the same as knight. The first night is the night you spend with your wife for the first time after you're married. Some would during this night consider making love essential, it is not a must however.

AA12059569	Its true and there is no other way around it.  A judge has to terminate parental rights unless someone is going to adopt the child then the biological parent can sign parental righs away.  Most states do this to keep men from signing their rights away just to get out of child support.  My ex wanted to do it to but at the time i was single and i didnt have a  husband to adopt him so the judge wouldnt do it.|`|87771a528bcdfbc8d75338a00033f18faa	Thats a 1st for me hearing that.

You don't "have" to "settle down" just now. But do start thinking about the future, and figure out if you do want to get married eventually, in theory. I'm 31 now, I dated many people,  some of them I was in love with, but most of them I would not marry! I was married once to a person I was in love with, but it didn't work out. I'm getting married again next month. As much as I enjoyed being single, I knew I ultimately wanted to be married and have a family; trust me, I've had to go through some rough relationship experiences to learn more about myself and figure out what I'm really looking for - but, as a result, I feel content with the choice I finally made! Good luck.    That said, try to be honest with your guy, and communicate to him that you're not interested in marriage. There's nothing worse than being misled in a romantic relationship.|`|AA11183334	The true purpose of dating is to explore whether or not the two of you will be compatible as life partners.  With all of the long term relationship you've had, you should have a pretty good idea of what character traits and values are important to you.     If this guy you have been dating has proven to you time and time again that he is dependable, great listener, compatible and you genuinely enjoy being around him, then you should consider his offer seriously.     Your real problem is fear.  You overcome fear with facts and knowledge.  So let me give you several facts:  1. You will not be 26 forever.  If you're not careful, you'll be 46 and playing the same games.  2. A good man is hard to find and gets harder to find over time.  That's because you will have to compete with the younger, decisive women who already gotten past their commitment issues.    3. All the women who tell you that being single is great over the longer term are lying their butts off.    4. The longer you wait and date with no purpose will cause guys to affix the "damaged goods" label to you because of the baggage you carry from previous relationships.  5. You lose sight on what a good man truly is.  Therefore, when one finally shows up and truly loves you, you rejected him outright because you stopped growing as a person.  6. Opposites don't attract.  Like attracts like.  7. You cannot have what you speak against.     8. Marriage is about two individuals become one.  9. There is no fear in love.     I re-read your response three times.  However, I feel that there is something that you are not mentioning which is the root of the problem.  Your comment that "After all a good marriage is about more then love." is way off base.  Love is the nucleus of a great marriage and binds the couple together through the best and worst of times.      I could suggest many books but I think that getting a psychologist to work through your issues would be best at this time.

If he doesn't, then he ain't worth your love my dear.|`|0d95196429e9ac5a84008ee64e78d722aa	This is HIS issue not yours! If you haven't done anything to make him not trust you, then he's the one that needs to relax. Talk to him about why he doesn't trust you and listen carefully to his answer. It might be that he's been burned in the past, but even so, you are not that person. He needs to figure this out within himself. Be patient... it will work out.|`|1ee2d63f5ab3e29917146770fc013295aa	Sleep with him.|`|08747f1fdf2c674ea988552ebfe7d838aa	You don't have to prove anything to him dear.

Be with him when its a real bad time for him   And all other friend are hiding.

Never let on that you suspect anything, but pay close attention to what he's up to.    Because you say you are such a trustworthy person, it stands to reason that you would also be a trusting person.

2dc60822cabb5a1ef563a85f37cb0646aa	The police first, to get it on record immediately.  If there are minor children involved, or if this pastor has access to minor children, call Child Protective Services.  Then call an attorney: Personal Injury-type.  If you end up suing for damages, you'll need to have the police and CPS records FIRST.  It will not look good if you called an attorney before that.  Your attorney may want to contact the press; let him/her decide when and how.  If you find no results, get a hold of non-profit child advocasy groups.  Picket, as a last resort.  Be careful about saying anything in public that you cannot prove.  Emails are not always sufficient proof.  State only the facts, e.g.: "I have an email that says..."; "We believe ...is a danger to society."    DON'T GO TO THE CHURCH FIRST!!  They'll cover it up, get a step ahead of you, and discredit your evidence.|`|188809790d127e6d92c8a1a3c53324acaa	that's a church for you...they sweep everything under the carpet...don't go through the church...go to the authorities..let them handle it...u won't ever get justice through the church.|`|8320586775a9ac69ad095ef26516eb32aa	By church do you mean the local body?

Those people always hide behind the word of the SO CALLED GOD just to harm children. Sue that church real good. Their nothing but scum bags working the churches these days.|`|AA11595176	CALL THE POLICE!!! HIRE AND ATTORNEY...

328d490344efe054bfeaef95e75fd74daa	Break ups are caused by a variety of things, with communication being  the number one reason why people dont work out. When we find someone we truly click with, we cant afford to keep our thoughts to ourselves nor can we afford to refuse to see someone else's views on things. A relationship is about meeting in the middle, riding the fence, having grey areas.|`|2b35b9212bb96f09c5b53a3710335644aa	Yes they do, even when the chemistry is still there.  Sometimes you just get tired of fighting and trying.  Sex isn't enough for a long lasting relationship.|`|18387ad8a0f142989e523fb5153f0407aa	I agree with becky.  Good sex is nice but it's not everything.  Other problems can arise in the relationship.  Other stresses may make the relationship weaker or just not worth it.|`|AA10955891	everyone is different|`|e28afc3a2533a60ee5465b6b8d794962aa	Why do you think people break up but end up continueing to have sex!|`|d93569f577829db1c895d0867a499a44aa	Yes, if that is all they have together eventual breaking up is almost inevitable.  'Chemistry' can't solve differences in ethics, ideals or goals although it sure can mask these differences for a while.   Without genuine friendship and good communication, chemistry is just lust filling the space that must be available for a life-mate to be recognized and welcomed into!|`|a85d8b150b75b3fc5588897546b59c58aa	I agree with what Becky said exactly. I'm a Becky too, but that's not why. I've been there and it is the hardest type of breakup.|`|2c57d14a02d6a4553fbff0fb126c8619aa	If both of you want to resolve your problems then you must communicate with each other to the fullest.  I believe that every problem can be resolved but you both have to want it for the relationship to workout.|`|30782b4ba50d31cbb40eedfde8c9fad7aa	Two people together should be to communicate, sharing their most differentiate secrets or fears and working things out together. They are together mentally and physically.     You have to be able to communicate with your mate. Sex is great but afterward what do you talk about. And if you solve difference, you will always be fighting. That along is not worth a relationship.

1750bf37f7dc4b6d407514512ffa1b1baa	Get a new boyfriend. You can't make him stop drinking.  You can only tell him that you wish he would and that you don't like it.|`|553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	Do you have a right to "tell"? No.  Do you have a right to "ask"? Yes.     If he says no and you don't want to stay with him if he continues drinking, it's time to leave.|`|d781489452cedd061dd0baf8f455d2b7aa	You can tell him that you think that he drinks too much, but he may not listen or agree with you. If it really bothers you, than you can either break up with him or refuse to go to the parties with him if he's planning on getting drunk. It is common for underage kids to drink, but there is a reason that they have a legal drinking age in place. Good Luck!|`|AA11671427	you can ask him not to but he is going to do it anyways he has to want to quit himself and if you told him to stop he would just do it that much more|`|1be4427662b611c44f7eefdbc6fc7dd4aa	no he can only recieve help if he wants help|`|691a6e8bbbee21c7645e672c03755392aa	tell him 2 stop if he dont ditch him
553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	Maybe you should say "hi" first?  Maybe ask her out for a date?    Love is a ways off from that.|`|1216a1fd08725c7aa02894cc26d6bb62aa	I'm assuming that since you're so shy, you haven't even talked to her yet.  I don't think you need to say you like her, and especially not love her... you don't even KNOW her!!!    How about asking her if she wants to go for coffee after class, get to know her and see how it goes first?|`|7c617c6236b0c95ac9797e538006d714aa	Are you guys dating?|`|39cba69dc3f5ddfb5a5f16220c79de87aa	just go up to her when you think it's the right time and ask her if she would want to go out some time. go out to dinner or some place fun to get both of your minds of of school work. try a arcade, going ice skating or roaler blading, a amusment park, the beach, a park and pack a picnic, horse back ridding, a concert,  ect. so both of you can have some fun and get to know each other better! it would be a fun time! good luck!  :)

Si no fue asi, entonces ya no es cuestion de tus hijos, si no de tu marido, los ni?os reciben bien a quien los trata bien, es mas entre ellos no hacen falta palabras, con las puras vibras tienen.    Suerte!!|`|d480d90ec191dd41de557c3534470c15aa	En primer lugar no quieras que l sea un sustituto de su pap, hablen ambos con ellos, expliquenles que tu relacin con su pap se termino y que ahora tu tienes una nueva pareja, que en ningn momento va a tratar de sustituir a su pap, que el solamente quiere ser su amigo, alguien en quien pueden confiar, y que como viven juntos lo mejor es llevar una relacin cordial, denles tiempo de asimilarlo y veras que con el tiempo lo van a aceptar.|`|17b4ea2be529557e6ae1d6b377cf3d3aaa	hay querida negrita, es lo mas normal del mundo, al contrario te deberia sacar de onda que se llevaran super bien, ademas checa la edad de tus hijos creen que tu nueva pareja viene a sustituir a su padre, ademas no saben como reaccionar, deben estar celosos de tu pareja porque para ellos es la idea de que papi y mami jamas van a separarse, y cuando sucede no entienden porque hasta que crecen en serio, habla con ellos, no les impongas nada sobre tu nueva pareja xk acabaran odiandola, no hables mal de su padre frente a ellos y explicales porque tu y su padre ya no estan juntos, pero eso no significa que no los ames, no cambies su vida de manera drastica y hablalo con tu ex pareja, comentale que no quieres que se lleven mal por el bien de tus hijos ademas hazle ver q si el algun dia tiene otra pareja tendran que convivir con ella, debes tener paciencia, estan en una edad dificil y habla mucho, pero mucho con ellos demuestrales que aunq no tienen a su padre en casa pueden llamarle, verle y convivir con el, pide apoyo a tu pareja y pidele que entienda que es muy importante para ti y que tolere a tus hijos que hable con ellos y les explique que el no vino a romper nada que solo te quiere a ti que a ellos tambien porque son parte de ti y amarte a ti es amarlos a ellos ahh y no se te vaya a ocurrir embarazarte ahora porq les das en la torre, si ya de por si sienten que hay un intruso en casa ahora imaginate un nuevo hermanito , no de veras tienes que lograr que se lleven bien ok?

Hay que hablarles y darles a entender que esta nueva persona no pretende en ningun momento reemplazar al padre. Y por otro procurar que tus hijos mantengan una buena relacion con tu ex. Yo estuve casada por 24 a?os, me divorcie, mi hijo menor tenia 13. Al a?o me case de nuevo. Mis hijos estuvieron muy felices que yo encontrara una nueva pareja, y lo quieren mucho. Y quieren mucho a su padre. Mi pareja adora a mi hijo el cual tiene ahora 19 a?os. Hay que tratar de inducirles que exista armonia hacia todas las direcciones. Mi ex ahora tiene una nueva pareja (la causante de nuestro divorcio), pero yo a mis hijos les recomiendo tener buena relacion con ella. Si estoy siendo feliz, deseo que los demas tambien lo sean. Hazle ver a tus hijos la parte positiva de tu nueva pareja, y lo importante que esta persona te hace sentir,  para que ellos poco a poco le vayan tomando cari?o.|`|cdbdb4a010c68faf0c2334a3aade0a1aaa	...por lo regular aparecen los celos...tambin, hay la posibilidad de que esperen que usted y el padre biolgico se reconcilien...si la relacin es reciente, le sugiero al padrastro que no empiece a dar rdenes a diestra y siniestra, que vaya lentamente, la pareja debe discutir en privado (no enfrente de ellos) las reglas, etc... para que estn de acuerdo y se apoyen...y para rematar la situacin la edad de tus hijos no es la ms fcil, traten de hablar mucho con ellos...les deseo Buena Suerte...|`|276ef5dc5842852a6433efc4424eb201aa	Para contestar, habra que tener ms informacin.

Tal vez sientas que te estoy diciendo lo que debes hacer,pero creerme que no es una sugerencia y nada mas.Los hijos crecen y se van dejndote sola.Lucha por tu matrimonio sin descuidar lo que te rodea.

Ay! Uy! Hubo de todo en las respuestas!!!    Claudia: Le con detenimiento tu peque?a historia. En ella dces "Me gusta" mi cu?ado, ?Jams! dijiste "Amo a mi cu?ado", que son cosas totalmente diferentes.  Dices tambin que t y el, No se llevan del todo bien. Y agregas que le eres "indiferente".    Creo que por ah debe estar el meollo del asunto.   Cuando de alguna manera nos sentimos rechazados por otra persona, que adems nos cae bien, empezamos a obsesionarnos de tal manera, que se puede llegar a equivocar lo que realmente sentimos hacia esa persona.    Y creo que lo que te pasa con tu cu?ado es mera "Obsesin"....NO es amor, ni atraccin, ni nada por el estilo.    Tienes que aceptar que no siempre sers del agrado de los dems, y no insistir en ser aceptada por el 100% de las personas que conoces. Cuando aceptes esta situacin, creo que dejars de tener "sentimientos equivocados" hacia los dems.    Cuando conociste al que hoy es tu esposo, supongo que tambin conociste a tu cu?ado....pero decidiste casarte con tu esposo, por lo tanto, si fue un error el hacerlo, fue responsabilidad nicamente tuya.....y no sera justo que las consecuencias de este hecho, las "pagara" tu marido.  Analiza bien tu situacin, pregntate a t misma acerca de tus sentimientos, y s honesta contigo misma.    Si lo que te "atrae" de tu cu?ado es mera obsesin o capricho, se soluciona, olvidando el asunto de querer ser aceptada por l.  Si esa atraccin, viene de tiempo atrs, an antes de casarte....es mejor que soluciones tu vnculo matrimonial de una forma madura y tranquila.....es decir, si definitivamente, no ests dispuesta a seguir con tu matrimonio, es mejor disolverlo  sanamente, a provocar una posible tragedia.    Y "buceadorblue".....en tu palabrera dijiste que cada "amor es diferente" ...por lo tanto, no se puede amar como pareja a dos personas distintas, al mismo tiempo.....a una la podrs querer y a la otra quizs amar.....pero t lo has dicho,....son "pelda?os diferentes".

Qu fcil es opinar cuando no es su corazn el que se agita.   Paso por una situacin similar, aunque con dos mujeres diferentes.  Y mi corazn se regocija con ambas.  Muchos te dicen que te pongas en los zapatos de tu marido, tus hijos, etc., pero nadie comprende lo que significa estar en TUS zapatos.  No comparto el que tengas que pensar en los dems.   La persona ms importante en tu vida eres T, primero que nadie.  Y tu felicidad se antepone a todas las dems cosas.  Te sugerira que hagas caso a lo que te dicte tu corazn, porque el corazn es el vocero de los deseos del alma.   Y prohibirte y reprimirte tus propios anhelos lo nico que te acarrear ser infelicidad por el resto de tu vida.  En "el alquimista" de Paulo Coelho hay una frase que dice "jams renuncies a tus sue?os".  Pregunto:  Qu sera del ser humano si no tuviera sue?os".  Los sue?os son el motor que nos impulsa en la vida.  Y con seguridad amas a tu esposo, pero ello no te impide tambien querer a tu cu?ado.  Se trata de amores diferentes, pero que han despertado en tu interior y no tiene nada de malo que lo quieras.  Descubrirs que en la vida hay muchos amores posibles, y querer a uno no significa que no puedes querer a nadie ms.  La intensidad de los amores son como pelda?os de una escalera.  Cada tipo de amor se ubica en un escaln distinto, pero todos estn en la misma escalera.  Unos ms arriba, otros ms abajo, pero todos estn ah.   Creo que si Dios le dio al ser humano la capacidad de amar ( Dios es Amor) pienso que no puede habernos otorgado ese don para poder aplicarlo mezquinamente a una sola persona.  Lamentablemente ( y en varias respuestas lo v), la cultura, la sociedad y las creencias religiosas condicionan y colisionan con nuestros sentimientos ms profundos.  Por qu no querer a esta segunda persona?  Qu tiene de malo?  Lo malo es que, gracias a costumbres y normas ancestrales nos han metido en la cabeza lo que est bien y lo que est mal ( y aunque tu corazn te dice que est bien, la sociedad y la religin te condenan), crearon en t el sentimiento de culpa para poder dominarte y doblegarte, coartando tu libertad de elegir ser feliz como t quieras, y finalmente te impusieron que la relacin de pareja es una relacin de pertenencia al otro.  Si hubiera libertad para amar con plenitud y sin subordinacin o pertenencia al otro, las relaciones seran ms honestas y no hara falta enga?ar al/a otro/a porque tengamos una capacidad de amar tan grande que trascienda el lmite de una sola persona.  Mi punto de vista parecer absolutamente egosta, y lo es.  Pero es el que ms me satisface y me permite seguir siendo yo mismo.  La postura que te plantean otros es auto-represiva, y al reprimirte y no dar espacio a tus deseos, no es posible que puedas ser plenamente feliz, porque quedar "algo" vaco en tu vida, una ilusin sin cumplir.   Quizs esto te suceda porque has madurado lo suficiente como para entender que el amor tiene esa magia y misterio que irrumpe en t y te desgarra pidiendo pista hacia lo infinito.   Si ese es tu caso, mi consejo es que despegues en vuelo hacia ese horizonte y no dejes de vivir ese nuevo desafo que la vida te plantea.  Aunque alguno te catalogue de puta, infiel y destructora de familias, no te dejes llevar por palabras necias y que no hablan desde el corazn.  Fjate que de hacerle caso, desde el vamos seras infiel contigo misma.  Y seguramente ante este nuevo hecho,  la realidad de tu vida ha dejado de ser lo encantadora y maravillosa que alguna vez haya sido.  Porque el amor no es un contrato que garantice permanencia y plenitud para toda la vida.  Hay seres que llegan a nuestra vida, irrumpen en ella y nos hacen colapsar de ah en adelante.  Eso es lo que te pas.  Y desde entonces te has transformado en otra persona, ms amplia, ms sensible, con nuevas visiones acerca de la vida y del amor.  Y no creo que eso est mal.  Que si te casaste con l es por algo, dijo alguien.   Cuando te casaste con el FUE por algo; pero ese algo forma parte de un pasado y de un momento de tu crecimiento personal, que hoy ha quedado superado y te est mostrando que existen otras formas diferentes de sentir.  Si la religin y la sociedad no hubieran condicionado a la humanidad de la forma en que lo han hecho,  hoy las relaciones de parejas no estaran signadas por la falsedad y el enga?o; los divorcios no seran moneda corriente, y las relaciones seran ms genuinas.  Trata de ser feliz todo lo que puedas.  Recuerda que lo esencial es invisible a los ojos.  No se ve bien sino con el corazn.  Date la oportunidad de ser feliz como t quieras serlo, y que no te importe lo que opinen los dems.  Ellos no estn en tus zapatos, ni en tus sentimientos.   Si no sigues tus deseos, vivirs arrepentida de lo que no hiciste, y que pudo llegar a ser.   Mejor arrepintente por lo hecho, no por lo que no hagas.  Y recuerda que por nuestra naturaleza humana, nuestros pecados estn perdonados desde antes de nacer.  Dios es tan grande que ya sabe todo lo que vamos a hacer.  Y si por ende lo permite es porque te est planteando un desafo para tu propio crecimiento.  Te deseo mucha suerte y ten en cuenta que cuando alguien desea algo, el universo entero conspira para que lo consigas.   Reprimirte slo incrementar tu deseo de hacer lo que concientemente ests rechazando.  S fiel contigo misma.   Dios te comprende y quiere lo mejor para vos.   De lo contrario no te hubiera puesto ante este desafo.  Mucha suerte, y que encuentres  la forma de poder ser plenamente Feliz.    Buceadorblue

Here are some suggestions:  A)Make a wonderful romantic dinner at home: dress up pretty, cook something good, arrange the table beautifully (candles are obligatory), decorate the whole palce with flowers, meet him at the door with a big smile, enjoy the evening ;)  B)Give him a spa treatment: undress him slowly, take him under the shower, wash him slowly and gently, dry him like a baby, let him lie on the bed and give him a relaxing massage (you can use special cream or aromatic oil) - he'd simply adore you for that and if he is not too sleepy he'll reward you accordingly  C) Turn the bathroom into a tropical island: fill the bathtub, put on some sexy bikini, scatter around some seashells, make exotic cocktails and invite him to share this tropical temptation with you  D) take him to the theatre/movies/fancy restaurant and flirt with him. Let him know that you want him right there, right now...The bathroom is yours...  E) Give him a mind-blowing b*ow job - this always scores points!  ;) Happy Anniversary! :)

Might is not right.|`|AA11189608	let people parent how they want.|`|AA11317014	It is really dumb when you see a child that keeps running onto the road or sticking their spoon in the power point and all the parents do is say "don't do that sweety". A smack would hurt considerably less than being run over by a bus! I can understand the non violent thing but there are times when the shock of a smack is more effective than stupid psycho babble.  Here also is a real life example..my friend would never smack her children in public. Whenever we went shopping her kids would destroy the stores (ripping packages, wiping stock from shelves etc) they knew they would not get a smack and by the time they got to the car she would not bother to chastise them.

And both sexes are apt to lie like hell in the early phase of dating someone new, because they want to appear "perfect" and snag the "prize catch".  I think in that area it's a tossup; some people are just more honest than others, male or female.  Some people come out of the gate BS'ing and are more honest as the relationship goes on, some people are fairly honest from the start, and some people start and end relationships with lies.     Whether either sex lies more often  in a dating situation is hard to say.|`|AA11119141	who talks more?

Nesses casos a cobran?a da familia por um matrimonio  muito grande, pois h a ridiculariza??o (dessa mulher perante os outros parentes) de q ela vai ficar para titia, ou q ela n?o tem competencia p segurar um homem. Isso acaba gerando essa dependencia de um homem e do casamento.  Por outro lado exixtem aquelas que querem casar para ter um arrimo no marido, ou seja, o marido trabalha e ela basicamente fica em casa p gastar o q o marido ganha, essas querem um casamento pq n?o conseguem uma independencia financeira dos pais e acham q podem usufluir sem traumas e culpa da frase "o q  seu  meu".   H tb aquelas (exemplares raros heim amigo) que tem sua dependencia financeira, s?o seguras de sua sexualidade, e querem ficar com quem ama.  Mas independente do tipo de mulher que quer casar, o q impera  que a mulher n?o gosta de passar por muitas m?os(exeto as piranhas mesmo) e uma mulher sria no casamento ela ter a certeza que pode se entregar sem medos ao seu homem, pois a mulher n?o quer apenas um parceiro sexual, quer um amigo, um companheiro, um amante, ( e isso n?o  uma vis?o romantica n?o  o q vemos mesmo em vcs homens) q dentro de um casamento seria de "exclusividade" dela, sem contar q para a mulher o casamento significa um comprimisso para o de der e vier.

7061b4a8289aa7d3f406307de8d139baaa	Teabagging is a slang term for the act of a man placing his genitals, specifically the scrotum, on the face, head, or in the mouth of another person.       Teabagging as a sexual practice    As a sexual practice, "teabagging" refers to a man dipping his testicles into the mouth of his partner as a form of oral sex; thus his partner was "teabagged", as the practice vaguely resembles dipping a teabag in a cup of water. Sometimes teabagging is taken to specifically mean the act of a male stripper repeatedly tapping and grinding his testicles into a patron's forehead. In this case the patron was "teabagged."    Teabagging first entered pop culture in John Waters' cult film Pecker (as an act - the forehead variety of teabagging - banned in a particular male strip club). Waters discovered the practice at a Baltimore bar called the Atlantis. He also claims it has since been superseded by the related act of helicoptering, "where they whap-whap you in the face with their hard-on" [1]. The term was more recently described in detail in the DVD Extras of The Aristocrats by Hank Azaria and also on the television series Sex and the City and appeared again in the film Soul Plane, included in a list of sexual acts and later defined. On the DVD of the film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Jay sings a song which includes the line "teabag my balls" in one deleted scene. It also appears in America (The Book) by the staff of The Daily Show and has been referenced on the television show by its host, Jon Stewart. It also appears as a kind of teenage party hoax in the movie In My Father's Den and in Brandon Vaughn's common acts of degradation DVD. It is featured in the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm (season 1, episode 3). It was described on an episode of the television series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. Finally, on July 30th 2002, the term was used several times on the air during a serious newscast when Captain Janks made a crank call. Also referenced in a dialog between David Cross and Michael Cera in an episode of Arrested Development (Dec, 2005). It is also used in the American version of Takeshi's Castle (MXC) whenever the green suited sumo wrestler (named the Green Teabagger) wins by sitting near the contestants face. On the hit MTV show Newlyweds, Jessica Simpson, Jessica and her Mom went out shopping and stumbled upon a brand of clothes labeled "teabagging", they then went on to discussing what they thought the term meant.    A variant known as a roman helmet or roman soldier involves laying the penis along the person's nose while placing the testicles on their eyes, somewhat resembling the helmet of a Roman legionary. This can also be referred to as a Gonziano in reference to the Muppet character Gonzo, who has a long, phallic nose. "Roger's Profanisaurus" also refers to this as the "Dutch blindfold". This practice, widely known in high-school and fraternity party circles, has become known as a "Famous Henry." In some areas of the United States, particularly Minnesota, this practice is known as a "Cap'n Crunch," for the hat worn by the iconic breakfast cereal mascot.|`|c566cf05ed62d411a1d59d1e3cab905daa	wow......here are all the definitions u could ever want|`|aa62bb284dc3a641906f42039d61401baa	Well, I've heard of sandbagging, but not teabagging.

See it as a blessing.  she will always have her eye on your mates.  How fun would a relationship with HER be? not fun at all...|`|AA12113105	Write her a letter about how you feel.

If you and yor wife fight all the time, I suggest yo get marriage counseling or get a divorce. I hope to God there are no kids in this marriage!|`|AA11584401	Go to yahoo horoscopes. On htis page there will be a compatibility test|`|AA12322494	go to yahoo horiscopes   this is what i foundon yahoo capatability.. read for yourself  Romantic Compatibility    Provided by Astrology.com   Gemini & Sagittarius     When Gemini and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, it can be a truly spectacular match! These two are extremely compatible; any rough spots they encounter during the course of the relationship are sure to be smoothed over with a minimum of effort. Gemini is quite able to provide pioneering, adventurous Sagittarius with the independence Sagittarius requires in a close relationship, because Gemini shares that same need. While Sagittarius needs physical independence, Gemini needs mental freedom, but the need is the same at base. These two both love new experiences, people and sensations, and are sure to have great adventures together. Both have attention spans that love to move quickly from one thing to the next in order to absorb as much experience as possible.     Gemini and Sagittarius are great friends, besides being well-matched lovers. They share a deep understanding and a very similar life view, based on a general, refreshing optimism and enthusiasm. Sagittarius can sometimes be a bit too blunt, saying things without thinking beforehand about whether they'll hurt someone or not, but Gemini is a hardy sort and, like Sagittarius, can forgive and forget quickly. These two don't have time or the interest required to hold a grudge.     Gemini is ruled by Mercury (Communication) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck). Mercury lends Gemini their chatty, intellectual demeanor; Jupiter is about both luck and philosophy, and lends Sagittarius their constant questing for knowledge and truth. This is a great match -- Gemini comes up with a new idea and Sagittarius jumps right on, ready to explore it to its limits.     Gemini is an Air Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This is quite the active relationship! Air spreads Fire far and wide, helping it increase in power. Gemini and Sagittarius together have just this effect on one another. Theirs is a very fiery, passionate connection; there's always something going on. Sometimes what's going on escalates into a real argument and actually hurt feelings; these Signs are opposite one another in the Zodiac, which means they have quite a deep and complex connection. In other words, when it's good it's very, very good, but when it's bad it can be terrible. These two may fight most about who's in charge; they both have competitive streaks that can flare up at inopportune moments. The good thing is, although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long -- Gemini is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge, and Sagittarius can forgive anything but a lack of respect from their Gemini lover.     Gemini and Sagittarius are both Mutable Signs and are thus extremely compatible. They're both flexible in the extreme, quite willing and able to adapt to change. This is a good thing; when Gemini changes their mind mid-thought, Sagittarius has no problem taking a 180-degree turn and keeping right up with their high-flying partner. When Sagittarius suddenly gets the travel bug, Gemini is very amiable about hopping in the car and going right along.     What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Sagittarius relationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge, utilizing intellect and turning it into action. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and drive. Common interests and similar personalities make them a compatible couple.    hope i helped

Are you still courting her?  Do you do things to show her you love her that are not sexual?  It can be complicated but not desperate.  Take her out to a nice quiet dinner, and ask her what makes her feel loved.  You might be surprised that sex is nowhere in the list!!  That's the way we are.  Men are like microwave ovens, the "heat" up quick.... women are like crockpots, it takes us awhile to warm up.  We react to everything that has happened through out the day.  While guys think about all day and are ready at the drop of a hat, we respond to the missed kiss in the morning, the complaint about the wrong dressing on your sandwich, etc.  If it goes on day after day, after day, our desire for sex dims.

I'll try more adventurous things, and other times I'm happy with plain ol' vanilla... Just keep the communication lines open, ask her (gently) why the change in the bedroom? It could be stress, or other factors too.     Best of luck dear!|`|cc57cac45ee2ada02ade151e4be4d824aa	Will you add a detail of how long you have been married? That would have helped me answer the question better! I've been married over ten years; and i can honestly say our sex life has gotten better! You have to be adventurous in married sex; otherwise it gets  boring! Talk to her man!! She's waiting for you to!!!|`|5cf0470a204de934eb842ceee9cb69cfaa	Talk to her, say honey, we have got to start sprucing this stuff up, romance her, do small things, do the dishes, help around the house. Whisper in her ear, what you are going to do to her, say I am going to tear that thing up. just sit and caress her at times, so much so, you are ready to tear each others cloths off. also say go  their, express yourself, what you like, and ask her do you like this. or what do you want me to do to please you. We can go on and on about this, but I am sure this is a start.|`|f97651e5f20eceba224c934b88a67e1faa	You may want to just ask her, lets try it a different way, something that will satisfy the both of you. I don't think she will come back around, due to sexual drives changes through the years, exspecially for a woman. So try something you both will enjoy. Have fun!

In realt non credo che le persone qui fingano di essere quello che non sono, ma se stiamo qui  anche perch abbiamo del tempo che utilizziamo per rilassarci e magari per cercare anche di capire... e inoltre, proprio lo star qui, il vedere una domanda scritta, ci permette di pensare meglio e riflettere prima di rispondere, cosa che a volte, anzi spesso, non ci  permesso quando siamo fuori di qui, anche se con amici o familiari. Per, credo che il succo delle risposte, soprattutto di quelle che impegnano in qualche modo il nostro essere, siano le stesse.|`|3f855e110057b92f7c63404716a38c25aa	una domanda finalmente ok.  credimi sono me stessa sempre. non ci sarebbe alcun motivo per avere....due personalit.  sicuramente  sono piu' comprensiva nella vita reale, c' tanta gente che bleffa su answers!!!!|`|f766da01b30a1e772e9cf98fa0a2822eaa	Certo  molto pi facile e semplice stare davanti ad uno schermo e scrivere delle risposte a persone che non si conoscono perch anche se alla fine i giudizi che diamo siamo imparziali o non sinceri chi se ne accorge? Per quanto mi riguarda sto anche ore a cercare delle domande interessanti alle quali rispondere e per ti dir non  facile......cio non  facile trovare delle domande interessanti per alle volte mi sento felice quando so di poter essere stata utile ad una persona. Lo so che poi nella vita reale sembra tutto molto difficile. Poter avere dei rapporti con le persone al mondo di oggi non  semplice: abbiamo tutti quanti mille impegni e non solo poco tempo per gli altri ma alle volte ne manca proprio per noi stessi. Per credo che il confrontarsi nella vita reale con gli amici (che vanno scelti, mi raccomando) alla fine  una cosa che da mille soddisfazioni. Io ho una miriade di conoscenti ma di amici veri, di quelli con cui puoi confidarti e puoi confrontari molti pochi........ma buoni.|`|788b639ce6d9770d7c0525b6b4cf593aaa	io sono uguale: perch dovrei essere diversa? :)|`|d96284e1cf00309a287cf2bc7ec49f66aa	io sono fedele a me stessa qui come nella vita.

4ca615e4c0e89e6fab19473e33df7df9aa	It sounds like this girl needed a friend and was willing to call a truce with you to get one.  Be careful.  I bet your truce won't last very long and in no time at all, this "truce" that has been called will be a distant memory.|`|AA11778516	no...once a bully always a bully....dont trust this girl...she is coming to you because she's been dumped by her friend.....seems that she's at a loose end....give her the cold shoulder...why bother with someone who's been mean to you throughout school.....send her packing|`|83d84ce4fe84db6283bdee67544801eaaa	Boy this is a hard question to answer. What is your gut feeling? Just because you call a truce doesn't mean that you have to be friends. Give it a little time. Keep in mind what this person has done before. Let her show you that she has changed. Maybe she has. Maybe breaking up with her former friend has made her see how wrong she was with you. As long as you keep boundaries and watch your heart, for a little while at least, you could say "Nothing ventured nothing gained." You never know, she may end up being your maid of honor at your wedding and your future children's god-mother. Wouldn't that make for a funny story?

It might be that this person wants to show you she's helping others to try and impress you.  She might not really be able to cope with relationships in the way that you do, and so in her helping she is also confused about the closeness and vulnerability of the other person. WHO KNOWS? I have a person whom I have to help .  And she's always telling me off.  I have to bite the bullet and do it anyway even if its hard, cos actually shes me friend.  However I do moan about her when she tells me off, its like venting feelings.  So perhaps your friend sees you as a vent.  It doesn't always mean she's going to do the same to you.  We all have a moan about others from time to time, even when we love them.  Terms have to be negotiated and you can't do that unless you know the person well enough for them to trust you.  She sounds complex. Perhaps she feels she has to earn peoples love rather than just accept people will love her for who she is.  She might have some sort of self protection thing going on,  like a stealth mode force field.   >>>>>>>>> love love love eeeeeeeeeeek push away push away didn't like her anyway Mrs knickerbater exploaded.|`|7c389af96e3c1074a8e7c958c0598f91aa	TRY and talk to her good friends are hard to fined|`|AA12050688	She's obviously got control issues, and she'll have to work through them on her own.

It doesn't really matter what you do or say this person will only, EVER, say good things about themselves and boast about themselves, even if someone else did it they will claim the credit.    Basically, the guy I know is a midget and I put him singing his own prasies down to the fact that he is so short, and has a small d*ck. He thinks that by him doing this and bigging himself up hides the fact that is is so short, inept, incompetent and an a*s wipe, which doesn't cos it just highlights it!!!    Like you I have also done this brown nosing sh*t shovellor some good turns, some which his own family would never do for him and he definately wouldn't do for anyone else.    Your friend sounds just like this maggot and I think that she may be doing it because she is low on self esteem and has little, if any, self confidence.    You need to take her to a side room, or a dark alley, and B*TCH SLAP her. If this doesn't work then do it a few more times. If she still doesn't change then you need to disown her. Chances are that she will realise that only you were willing to put up with her crap and will come back to you with a grovelling apology.

Do you like her?  Just because she likes you is no reason to ask her out.  It has to be mutual.

AA11119626	Ooops. Well, you're probably not gonna like this answer, but it's true...    You apologize. To everybody. See, you were grounded, which you knew, and you had Vincent over anyway, which you knew would get you in trouble, and you tried to bribe your sister to keep her mouth shut (not a good example for your little sis), and...    Yeah, it stinks that you were grounded on your birthday, for sure. That's a given.    Still, you probably don't want to be grounded until you're 100, so you show everybody you are learning from your mistakes, including the very difficult (we all hate it) lesson on "how to admit you were wrong and apologize."    Then you ask, politely, if you can plan something to celebrate your birthday, for after you're finished being grounded.    And you try to remember not to make one mistake worse by piling more on top of it. Sorry, but it's true. Good luck!|`|AA11018224	Gone are the Winds!|`|006ca21e0220e798b6395228fe255fa9aa	calm down and teach them what respect and privacy is|`|12d42342ca13df79bf836df775b2b915aa	Get your fifty back and buy a new lock and even a deadbolt.

Even though you were grounded you shouldn't have went behind your parent's back. The more you follow their rule even if they seem unfair the more they will trust you. I have a younger sis too and very annoying. But just politely ask her to leave and if she doesn't confront your parents about it. Oh never pay younger sisters money it always goes wrong.

Y no tiene nada que ver con el dinero!!

UMA MANEIRA DE VC EXPRESSAR O BEM-ESTAR Q VC DESEJA DELES.|`|cc935bbcded024e9f105cb2cf2cb65a6aa	Amar  um estado de esprito, um modo diferente de ver e tratar uma outra pessoa, tornando-a nica aos olhos e nas aten??es do amante.   Esse estado de esprito deve ser cuidado para se perpetuar e apenas de modificar para melhor com a passagem do tempo, vencendo a rotina, o cotidiano e as agruras da vida.   A convivncia descuidada, que provoca certo relaxamento nas aten??es para com a outra pessoa, , sem sombra de dvidas, a maior responsvel pela perda daquele fascnio que o amor contm.   A rotina, enfim, exerce um efeito negativo e extremamente danoso sobre esse estado de esprito.    S?o muitos os problemas que um casal enfrenta em seu relacionamento, seja na fase de namoro, seja no noivado, seja no casamento, surgidos pela convivncia ou pelo processo natural de deixar cair s mscaras e revelar-se intimamente, coisa que fatalmente acaba surgindo quando a uni?o j  definitiva.   O que prevalece, na maior parte das vezes,  o aspecto pessoal, a qumica entre as pessoas, a atra??o que n?o respeita preconceitos ou barreiras.  Nada disso se faz sem experincia, sem pacincia, sem carinho, sem perseveran?a.    preciso que o amor seja cultivado no cora??o de cada um, transformando-se em felicidade, f e confian?a no relacionamento de ambos.  As m?os dadas, o beijo no port?o, o abra?o possessivo e dominador, aquele olhar furtivo, a paquera dissimulada, o bilhetinho inesperado, o toque sutil, o ro?ar de peles, o perfume pessoal, a bebida preferida, a comida predileta, tudo isso e muito mais s?o detalhes que v?o se somando cada um com a sua importancia, construindo a dinamica de um relacionamento.     Quando este se rompe, cada um desses detalhes significa uma falta, um vazio. Tudo junto cria a saudade, que traz a dor e anseia pelo esquecimento rpido, como forma de amenizar o sofrer incessante.    N?o h remdio que cure a dor do amor, sen?o um novo amor.   Prazer e avers?o, a??o e inrcia, satisfa??o e frustra??o, atra??o e repuls?o tambm encontram nas simpatias formas de canalizar energias positivas e, eventualmente, at mesmo as negativas, quando os fins justificarem os meios. At mesmo quando um amor acaba mesmo no caso de uma desilus?o amorosa dolorida, ningum pode desanimar, pois o fim sempre significa um recome?o e o certo  partir para outra, porque amor que acaba n?o era verdadeiro nem definitivo.    O homem precisa do amor e do sexo para viver, pois todos ns nascemos do amor e da uni?o sexual de nossos pais. Assim como o ar que respiramos, o amor quando  puro traz realiza??es maravilhosas para as pessoas. Seu complemento, o sexo,  uma infindvel fonte de prazer e sempre h algo mais a descobrir sobre a sexualidade e algo mais para desfrutar.     O amor  amigo de todos e sua a??o, em princpio, deve ser a busca mtua da felicidade.|`|2d9a24e6388c3353f448d3207ab54593aa	entra na pagina  www.poema-de-amor.net , ai tem poemas lindo ..sorte..

eebfdc0bc0e16fdf2529317cb1725015aa	Bueno   antes que nada se necesitan mas datos para poder juzgar la situacion lo mas que puedo es adivinar asi que lo intentare.  Me imagino que acabas de terminar, y que hace poco que te llamo tu ex-novia y sin embargo te quedaste con la idea, de que si te hablo porque te extra?a o porque le inflas su ego, primero que nada quien hablo, ella o tu.  Tu tienes la respuesta.  De que hablaron, te dijo que te extra?o, te invito a una fiesta, te dijo cosas sin sentido, o muy vanales, algo asi como que solo para escuchar tu voz.   Tu tienes la respuesta.  Deja de pensar en los motivos por los que te llamo, el chiste es que te llamo y que es dificil para ella cortar la relacion.  El decir que quedamos como amigos, depende de varios factores que se pueda concretar, si alguno de los dos enga?o o termino la relacion de manera brusca, sera dificil.  Si la persona que termino es la que llama es el primer signo de arrepentimiento.  Preguntale a tus mejores amigos, o confidentes es mas hasta a tus padres, como miraban esa relacion, nada mas recuerda que te pueden decir cosas feas y si pides consejo, te puede decir cosas feas de ella, si llegas a volver con ella, hazte el favor de no comentarselas nunca.  Por ultimo, independientemente de la edad que tengas y lo feo y tormentoso que parezca tu futuro en el campo del amor, recuerda que tarde o temprano saldra el sol,y asi como puedes continuar con ella, tambien puedes encontrar a alguien totalmente diferente que complemente (entiende bien esta palabra) tus defectos y virtudes, y llegue a ser tal vez la definitiva.   Tranquilo, la vida sigue.  Te lo digo yo que me costo 7 a?os despues de terminar el encontrar a la mujer con la que me case.|`|e179a80829389b51e72df8f8d023ad5daa	Si te expres o te dejo ver que tiene algn inters en ti, o te dio pie a que le propusieras algo, o te habl melosamente y se not trieste, entonces SI puede tener algn inters todava.    Pero.... si se oa muy tranquila, alegre, feliz o entusiasmada con su vida o nuevas actividades, entonces SOLO fue la culpa o el ego. No ha de tener nada serio o seguro todava con otro y quiere tenerte "en remojo" por si sus planes no funcionan o por si de pronto se siente sola.    Por seguro est en la etapa de tomar la decisin definitiva y "deshacerse" de lo que sinti por ti para dejarte en el pasado,   tenerte todava en su presente.............por si acaso.    Ahora, la pregunta sera: tu ests interesado en ella??  Y agregara: vale la pena estar interesado en ella??    Animo y suerte en est etapa de tu vida.  Solo recuerda que el da a da se rige por las decisiones que se te presentan y el futuro depende de como las resuelvas.|`|600d26cc86e6dc9eba0915866f35421baa	pues esque depende la situacion y que te haya dicho...|`|17f99e3d74427dfa5715f201242204e7aa	te llamo porke no tenia nada bueno q hacer|`|110f07f5551e31f228de1884a3509415aa	Que te dice tu corazn?|`|e526bbe37e9ff591e81d9ddb431762eaaa	NINGUNA DE LAS DOS COSAS..

Saludos,abrazos, presentaciones,caballeros empilchados de primeray damas finsimas, hermosas algunas y muy elegantes.   En fin, todas esas cosas que pasan regularmente en esas ocasiones.   El hombre, muy cuidadoso y respetuoso, se sienta en una mesa   redonda rodeado de gente de lo ms importante, entre empresarios y banqueros.   Inmediatamente los mozos de guante blanco sirven una entrada, exquisita. Champagne francs, vinos importados y finsimos. El primer plato, de un nivel supremo.   Cinco minutos despus,el hombre en cuestin siente, punzante y artero el primer retorcijn que se banca estico. A los diez minutos, el magma ataca nuevamente pero ms duramente con contracciones severas.   Su cara ya realiza alguna mueca de dolor, pero mayormente de preocupacin.   A los veinte, un nuevo y virulento ataque torna la situacin insostenible, ya no da ms.   Sus esfnteres, a su mxima capacidad de bloqueo no pueden resistir el embate del gas. Sabe que si se inclina tan slo un  grado hacia a delante,un feroz e impo flato escapara de su   encierro y sera suficiente como para evacuar el saln en el acto que se presumira un ataque terrorista.   El pobre sujeto lucha a brazo partido para aguantar el twister y de tanto aguantar, ya encorvado sobre el plato se le escapa un eructo feroz, como el bramido de un gigantosaurio carolinis , que hacevolar como  un papel al viento la peluca de la dama que tena enfrente.   Hace entonces un esfuerzo sobrehumano como para disimular con un poco de tos, pero esto descontrola los esfnteres y una terrible seguidilla de pedos, algunos con firma, escapan   ??? Coff...Cofff,ratata..ta, psss..ratata.. Cof   !!!!!!pssssss..raaaa ! Un horror !!!!!   Ha comenzado la ofensiva y el bombardeo es incontenible!!   El ruido de los pedos, supera ampliamente el de la tos a lo cual se   suma un hedor insoportable por el alto nivel de toxicidad del gas.  Todos lo miran absortos e incrdulos. Pero en el momento de ensayar la tos, le comienza a picar la nariz,  con lo cual le genera un tremendo estornudo y como no abre la boca para amortiguarlo, del naso le salen dos mocos tipo vela con tonalidades verdeamarhelas y bien largos, que rapidamente le llegan al mentn.

Cagar es un placer;   d cagar nadie se escapa,   caga el rey,   caga el papa,   caga el buey,   caga la vaca,   y hasta la se?orita mas guapa,   hace sus bolitas de caca.   Viene el perro y lo huele,   viene el gato y lo tapa.   Total,en este mundo de caca   de cagar nadie se escapa.   Que triste es amar sin ser amado   pero mas triste es cagar sin haber almorzado.   Hay cacas blancas por hepatitis,   las hay blandas por gastritis,   cualquiera que sea la causa,   que siempre te alcanza,   aprieta las piernas duro,   que cuando el trozo es seguro,   aunque este bien fruncido el culo,   ser por lo menos, PEDO SEGURO!!!!!.   No hay placer ms exquisito,   que cagar bien despacito.   El ba?o no es tobogn,   ni tampoco subibaja,   El ba?o es para cagar,   y no pa' hacerse la paja.   Los escritores de ba?o,   son poetas de ocasin,   que buscan entre la mierda,   su fuente de inspiracin.   nosotros que os creis,   sagaces y de todo os res,   decidme si sois capaz,   de cagar y no hacer pis.   Donde tanta gente acude,   la chica se pasa el dedo,   y el tipo se lo sacude.   caga tranquilo,   caga sin pena,   pero no se te olvide,   tirar la cadena.   El tipo que aqu se sienta,   y de escribir versos se acuerda   no me vengan a decir,   que no es un poeta de mierda!.   Donde acude tanta gente ,   hace fuerza el mas cobarde ,   y se caga el mas valiente.   Ni la mierda es pintura,   ni los dedos son pinceles,   por favor, pendejos,   lmpiense con papeles!.   Para ti que siempre,   estas en el ba?o:   Caguen tranquilos,   caguen contentos,   pero por favor,   caguen adentro!.

AA11932760	Everybody who goes to Thailand falls in love. The people are just so wonderful.  I'd bet the girl is nearly ten years younger than olu, and her parents won't allow her out socially unless chaperoned. What are you doing asking your mam for permission when you are 30 years old. Sound like an apron string job to me.    Have you considered the long term consequences if you do go there and form a relationship. Do you know how difficult it is for her to get a visa, or how difficult it is for you to stay there a long time?  I would say there are many things to think about, and once you've done that, if you still want to go there, I'd just tell your mum your leaving home and you'll see her sometime if you come back.

Thousands of people travel alone every day and you're not the first one to do so, just take sensible precautions and since you're a tour leader yourself you know the traps that the tourists fall into so you can avoid them. Plus you're 30 and I think that's mature enough to go wherever you like, go alone...find your girl and see how things go!

AA11808736	Oi Nati! O orkut (www.orkut.com)  uma rede social que surgiu recentemente e mudou os hbitos de grande parte dos internautas, principalmente dos brasileiros. Por incrvel que pare?a, o Brasil representa mais de 50% dos usurios do orkut em todo mundo. Criado pelo engenheiro turco Orkut Buyukkokten, o site agora faz parte do "imprio" da Google, empresa proprietria do site de busca mais conhecido no mundo.  Os usurios o acessam de todas os lugares possveis, seja em casa, no trabalho, na escola ou na universidade. Se voc for a um cyber caf, um bar, uma casa noturna ou qualquer quiosque que possua acesso  Internet, provavelmente ver algum acessando uma pgina de fundo lils, com vrias fotos de pessoas, comunidades etc. Existem muitas comunidades com temas interessantes, onde realmente surgem debates proveitosos. Ok, no orkut tudo  vlido! Afinal, o que alguns consideram inconvenientes, outros consideram muito divertido. Quem nunca gostou do seriado Chaves ir odiar as dezenas de comunidades dedicas a ele. Mas quem  um "chavesmanaco", poder ficar horas dando risada ao relembrar as histrias do programa, contadas pelos membros da comunidade. Existem tambm as comunidades do tipo "Eu odeio". Por exemplo, se voc n?o gosta do Galv?o Bueno, saiba que existem mais de 20 comunidades do tipo "Eu odeio o Galv?o Bueno".  Enfim, o orkut virou uma febre. E junto com a febre, veio uma praga, que s?o os famosos spams. Felizmente, esse problema est sendo contornado com a desabilita??o do envio de mensagens para os membros das comunidades. No incio, ao acessar o orkut, o sistema exibia um aviso do tipo "Voc tem 54 novas mensagens", sendo que 99% delas eram um verdadeiro lixo eletr?nico, como correntes, propagandas etc. Atualmente, voc pode enviar mensagens somente aos seus amigos, e n?o para uma comunidade inteira.|`|7decfc57cf3a36ad93d8cd35692a9529aa	me mande o seu e-mail que eu lhe envio o convite e te explico como funciona!!|`|c092df1d6dd9d89741936b59ee209da1aa	Clica no meu avatar e me manda uma msg q eu te mando um convite!  xD~|`|bb6101b364c448a80ef1f127e6456e49aa	indico pra vc o site www.naotenhoorkut.com l cadastrando-se no frum vc consegue convite, decobre vrios programas que facilitam o uso do orkut e recebe convite se precisar...

Aprs de long mois de discution nous nous sommes rencontr, et depuis nous vivons une relation vraiment merveilleuse. Mais j'ai connu deux personnes pour qui l'exprience  tourn court. Le jour mme de la rencontre ils se sont rendu compte de leur erreur, et sont rest de bons amis.  Je crois qu'il faut voir l'autre le sentir couter le son de sa voix  le toucher le voir voluer dans son environnement pour tomber rellement amoureux.

241ddbb0e9323b39f9219ada1e889407aa	I actually asked a question about this earlier. I had an experience where I COULD NOT get someone off my mind, TIME DID NOT EVEN HELP. I spent 2 1/2 years with this guy on my mind 24/7 (literally). I'm not a weirdo obsessive person, but I do over-think and over-analyze things, and I think A LOT. This developed a situation with, I hate to say it, an obsession. What cured me? I got myself out of the situation and away from the guy, and when I did, I BROKE FREE and forgot about him.     You are probably obsessing over this guy. Get yourself away from him before it gets ugly.

There is no real action to take that will stop you wanting him however, you must decide what you want for yourself. Do you want to be maybe arrested due to his drug use? Will he crash from drinking?

Dices que el te ama, pero que tu no? estas segura? No sera que tu embarazo provoca que tu nivel de estres suba de nivel? Medita un poquito si realmente lo quieres, o tal vez sientes un poquito de coraje por no estar con tu familia, TE COMPRENDO BASTANTE LINDA, porque a mi me pasa algo parecido que lo tuyo, y eso que estoy en mi Pais pero en diferente estado, y a pesar de que tengo 2 a?os 7 meses de casada, extra?o mucho a mi padres y mis hermanos, y sobrinito, y tambien deje mi trabajo y mi profesion por venirme a otro estado de mi Pais, de verdad que TE COMPRENDO.  PERFECTAMENTE, porque a pesar de que mi ESPOSO ES BUENO, TRABAJADOR, Y EXCELENTE PERSONA, a veces siento que me hace falta algo, tal vez porque no trabajo y deje mi profesin, jijijijiji tal vez me hace falta ocuparme en algo. Te haria bien hablar con tu familia por telefono aunque sea, o a traves del msn, para sentirte un poquito mejor.    Y  si definitivamente no sientes que lo quieres, seria mejor separarte no crees, suena facil decirlo pero hacerlo es muy diferente, Pero piensalo muy bien porque el matrimonio es asi, todas las parejas discutimos, todas en algun momento nos peleamos, pero es normal, (claro que si llegara a darse el caso de maltrato fisico o psicologico, pues Adios, bye) TRANQUILIZATE, MEDITALO Y HABLALO CON TU ESPOSO, DILE COMO TE SIENTES. OJALA Y TENGAS SUERTE.     ????MUCHAS FELICIDADES POR TU BEBE!!!! DIOS TE BENDIGA.    P.D.

Si decids separarte, no te sientas mal por haber tenido solo 2 meses de casada, el tiempo no importa, lo que importa es que ests bien y que tu marido tambin este bien.  Tambin podes plantearle a tu marido todo lo que sents y quizs pueden ir a vivir a tu pas.  Creo que fueron demasiados cambios para vos y por eso es tu tristeza.  Es normal que extra?es a tu familia y mas estando embarazada, ya que una mujer se pone mas sensible y necesita mas de su propia madre y de todos sus afectos.  Mucha Fuerza!! y no te olvides que todo se puede solucionar.  No te quedes as, busc una solucin lo ms rpida posible para que los 3 esten bien.  Suerte!!|`|ce506a2bb07a178144d32852ddb2548baa	yo me case a los 21,y llevo 13 a?os casado,y no me imagino estar con alguien con quien no me ciento bien,o buscas algo para hacer,o pegate la buelta a tu pais,por que luego de un tiempo,las que van a sufrir son tus hijos|`|0d7d7fdc1589f26477a848f6d405b1e2aa	Mira, yo no creo que tu decisin haya sido apresurada si es que cuando lo hicistes estabas enamorada.  No olvides que esta embarazada y esto cambia totalmente a la mujer hasta en sus sentimiento  conosco una amiga que cuando se embaraz no podia soportar a su esposo durante todo el embarazo, por lo que yo creo que este rechazo hacia tu marido pueda ser por el cambio hormonal que estas teniendo    Te voy a contar algo    Cuando yo me case, me fui a vivir con la familia de mi esposo muy lejos de mi familia, y yo no conocia a nadie (pero por lo menos dentro del mismo pais), yo no conocia a nadie, ni siquiera a su mama.  No tena comunicacin con nadie de mi familia (ni siquiera por telefono porque no haba), el primer a?o creo que lo aguante porque realmente estaba enamorada de l, pero no era feliz porque faltaba algo, ese algo es la familia. Ahora llevo 15 a?os de matrimonio y tengo comunicacin con mi familia, todo cambio con tener conumicacion y un hijo, te llena todos los vacios.    Disculpa que yo te cuente mi experiencia, pero me parece que es muy parecida a la tuya, no desmayes, analiza bien lo que te esta pasando, hablalo con el, trata de comunicarte con tu familia.  Si despues de todo ves realmente que no estas enamorada y que eres infeliz, entonces tienes que tomar la decisin de separarte, porque no puedes tener un hogar sin amor y sin felicidad, recuerda que tienes una vida dentro de ti y que esa peque?a vida necesita desde ahora todo el amor, el ni?o que llevas siente todo lo que tu estas pasando, tienes que calmarte un poco, analiza bien tu situacin.    Espero que tengas suerte  Saludos|`|fe6459d31d06a83fcf1792701da8583eaa	Mujer...mujer que has hecho? solo dos meses de casados y un mes y medio de embarazo...mujer la vida no es solo diversin y posicin social la vida es algo mas importante que muchas cosas materiales la vida es compartir con la persona que uno realmente ama....ama y se feliz....|`|d7557d24c63c1ac1695bacd2950447c0aa	Es muy normal sentir que uno tom una mala decisin al casarse; sobre todo durante los primeros meses. Adems tu tienes el agravante de vivir lejos de todos tus seres queridos y de tu territorio.  Si te apresuraste a casarte no te apresures a separarte; trata de poner en orden tus sentimientos y no dejes que el miedo de estr casada probablemente con quien no debiste te amargue la existencia.  Sera bueno que pudieras visitar a tu familia y a lo mejor all ves las cosas de una forma ms objetiva.  Mucha suerte y que Dios te ayude.|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Ya tu misma respondiste a tu pregunta....tomaste la decisin de casarte muy rpido y ahora estas sufriendo las consecuencias.  Lo que yo hara en tu caso:  Hablara con el y le dijera exactamente como me siento, ya que lo mejor de todo en una relacin es la honestidad y la buena comunicacin, si el de verdad te quiere te va a entender.... a lo mejor se pueden regresar a tu pas y tratar de hacer su vida juntos all donde tu tienes a tus seres queridos, a lo mejor as todo funcione entre ustedes y no te sientes tan sola y "ahogada" por su absoluta presencia.|`|1dd3f406caee5cd8ebec69f28667b686aa	Ests embarazada y eso cambia hasta los sentimientos, cuando yo tuve mi 2o embarazo, el solo hecho de sentir que mi marido meta la llave en la cerradura me produca vmito. No te llenes de razones para abandonar, llnate de razones para seguir adelante!  Hzte estas preguntas: vale la pena este hombre para merecer una oportunidad?   me gustara tener a mi hijo sola, lejos de su padre? Camina por lugares desconocidos y concelos, pide un mapa, aprende a tomarle el gusto a las cosas. Ve a una buena panadera, a un cafecito, entra a clases de polaco, en fn, llnate de motivos amables para seguir. Cuando todo se ve oscuro, cuando las fuerzas nos fallan, cuando lo vemos todo perdido, es cuando ms fuerza has de tener, cuando ese interior tuyo debe brillar para alumbrar tu camino. Sigue adelante y enfrenta la vida con decisin, no con cobarda como hasta hoy.|`|bc1ef57390c1bc5d0ed1ca2d89d93881aa	BUENO CREO QUE DEBES DE CALMARTE Y PENSAR BIEN LAS COSAS POR ALGO TE CASASTE CON EL NO LO CREES AVECES EL EMBARAZO NO PROVOCA ESO DE NO QUERER NAD CON EL MARIDO Y NO HABLO DE SEXO SINO DE NO QUERERLO NI VER NO LO QUEREMOS CERCAS NI NADA DE ESO CREO QUE DEBES DE ORDENAR TUS SENTIMIENTOS PARA QUE NO VAYAS A COMETER UN ERROR PIENSA SI LO QUIERES O NO Y BUENO TE DESO MUCHA SUERTE Y BUENO TE QUIERO FELICITAR POR EL BB ........................................  si quieres una amiga aqui estoy contactame asi por lo menos tendras con quien platicar e deshogarte aunk sea por la compu|`|19f1fe6095066ea4eea12ee4c3fdbf25aa	pues amiga ante todo lo primero que debes ponerte a pensar es que fue lo que te hizo casarte con l, que fue lo que te gusto ? quizas lo que te pase es que extra?as a tu familia y extra?asa tu pais busca la manera de mantenerte ocupada en algo comentale que te sientes un poco mal sola que necesitas del contacto de otras personas quizas lo que te pasa es que al sentirte lejos de tu familia  te hace sentir que le odias y que no le aguantas ponte a escribir lo que te gusto de el y lo que no te gusta de el ahora pon tambien que te gustaria cambiar y mencionaselo espero que estes bien y cuidate mucho por el bebe|`|ca82af4e2a219eb8a407ac58aa534fa8aa	Mira apenas llevas solo 2 meses de casada es en lo que te acostumbras a estar viviendo con el. Ese cambio no es fcil solo es cuestin de tiempo, adems estas embarazada y cuando estamos embarazadas las hormonas se vuelven locas comenzamos a sentir sentimientos y cosas que no sentamos antes. Ten paciencia y con el tiempo sabrs lo que realmente quieres.

Hell, I lost touch and barely speak to my cousin whom i did everything with growing up.   When you have kids, and possibly your circle of frieds dont..........they tend to start excluding you or think you dont want part of those fun things. Sometimes they may feel you've changed.  A true friend is the one you could even go to the bathroom in front of.  The movie Stand By Me ends with "friends come in and out of your life like bus boys in a restaraunt". That is why I am blessed I have Katie. Ive known her since 4rth  grade. We are now 31. We dont even exchange birthday cards.   Is it you who stopped calling your friends becasue you got married and had kids????? That would eventually cause those friends to stop calling.|`|e7eab1496372bb5fb19469be5f507bbaaa	Even if you do get married and lose touch, you'll still always be friends. I mean, even though you dont' see each other often, when you do meet up, you'll still have lots to talk about won't you? And you don't have to lose touch, you could always try and keep in touch with each other.     And what people mean by saying, "friends forever" it kinna means, "Whenever you need me, I'll always be here for you." So, even if you're busy and have your own life, when you're sad or upset and you phone your "friend" they'll still be there to comfort you and talk to you about your problems. Cos no matter how hard you try, you'll never forget all the good times you've had with each other.    I mean...i've moved and i've stopped talking to a friend of mine, but i'll always always think of her as a friend. No matter what, she'll always be a friend to me because i can never forget her and all the times we've had.     "Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart"

My only real advise is to get out why you can, it took me 12 years and 3 kids later to finally get out and even though its hard being a single mother, its better then waiting for him to get his act together....take care and I will pray for you...read the following its very true...  If a man wants you, nothing can keep him away.      If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay.    Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior.    Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you from heartache.   Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be.   Slower is better.  Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy. If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve then heck no, you can't "be friends". A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend.   Don't settle. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is. Don't stay because you think "it will get better." You'll be mad at yourself a year later for staying when things are not better. The only person you can control in a relationship is you. Avoid men who've got a bunch of children by a bunch of different women. He didn't marry them when he got them pregnant, why would he treat you any differently? Always have your own set of friends separate from his. Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up.   Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later.   You cannot change a man's behavior. Change comes from within. Don't EVER make him feel he is more important than you are... even if he has more education or in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less. Never let a man define who you are! Never borrow someone else's man. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.   A man will only treat you the way you ALLOW him to treat you.   All men are NOT dogs.!!!  You should not be the one doing all the bending... compromise is two way street. You need time to heal between relationships... there is nothing cute about baggage...     Deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you... a relationship consists of two WHOLE individuals... look for someone complimentary... not supplementary.     Dating is fun... even if he doesn't turn out to be Mr. Right.      Make him miss you sometimes... when a man always knows where you are, and you're always readily available to him - he takes it for granted.      Never move into his mother's house. Never co-sign for a man. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything that you need. Keep him in your radar but get to know others.      Share this with other women and men (just so they know)... You'll make someone smile, another rethink her/his choices, and another woman prepare, and a man aware.|`|a3460cad594511487c9583ed7740c523aa	He had to be put in a rehab program for a reason, if he's an addict dont make excuses for him. You and your daughter's saftey are  1. forget this ahole he not worth sheding tears over. Its not easy being a single mother on your own but its better than being in abusive situation.  Get sole custody of your daughter  Have his wages garnished a.k.a child support (if he has a job or trust fund, etc)  Get a restraining order so he stays away from you and your   daughter. Whatever you do to "hurt him" go about it in a legal fashion so it does not come back to haunt you  After gaining full custody move out of state if you have the option or recources (ie family or friends out of state)  You and your daughter are worth more than the way he treats you

Je paie souvent le restaurant  ma copine, mais en gnral on partage,  chaque fois, si l'on partage je suis limite mufle et si c'est elle qui paie (anniversaire par exemple) je suis un radin de la pire espce; on ne dois pas avoir la mme notion d'un juste milieu...    Quant aux femmes carriristes je trouve qu'elles ont beaucoup plus de dignit que les profiteuses et autres femmes entretenues que je trouve pathtiques.

2ed0d0090ad4c96539ccb5a473beaab4aa	no and even if they were in a relationship she still shouldnt be mad at you if he told you he was single then how would you know?that sounds strange to me they must still have feelings for each other.|`|6e0328691c25087ca0d59b77f569a5d3aa	As you said, her anger is understandable.    However, she  still appears to be a very important part of his life - something he neglected to tell you.  Frankly, if anyone should be upset - it really should be you. He lied to you by not telling you he was still involved with this other woman. He took advantage of you, and then left you to deal with the fallout he created when he told his girlfriend about his relationship with you.     (Think -if he really cared for you, why would he even do something like that in the first place?)    It should be very apparent he selfishly took advatange of you to get back at her for something she may have done, and to make her jealous.    No one deserves to be treated the way he has treated you. Regain your self-respect and dump this loser.|`|4a850e4dd57b52d947fce0c950419a2faa	Sweet baby Jesus and the orphans!

I think that they fight, break up then rub new relationships in eachothers faces to strike up jealousy so they can get back together. No she has no right to be mad at you. She needs to take any problems up with him.|`|7d90a3b4a28f2a07552e871d30e8ed53aa	If they both are doing it then they have the problem not you.|`|AA11264617	OK see this from her view... she maybe loved him so she's mad you got closer than she did to being with him. if that makes sense. they obviously broke up for a reason although i dont really believe he was serious about the relationship if he went off and told his ex what you did... its possible he was just trying to make her jealous. and it worked.

You can continue helping him - get up earlier in the morning to give yourself the extra time. You can make sure in the evening that all of his stuff is ready to go for the next morning. Or, you can just start ignoring it hoping he would stop being a baby about it and finally grow up. I don't think you can change it, tho, if he doesn't want to change.|`|1d2be7de9e2411bcfcb2ae755d4b7287aa	Somewhat sounds like my husband. He too would lose his keys so we now have a spot for them that he puts them in everytime he gets home - it took a couple of days, but he got into the habit of placing them there.    He was ALWAYS losing his wallet, so I bought him a wallet with a chain on it, it stays on his pants - until the next morning, then he places it on a new pair of pants.|`|AA11117366	Buy a tray, dish or basket specifically for his keys, wallet, etc.  Put it someplace close to the front door, or bedroom door.  Don't say anything except, "I got you this tray, etc. for your keys."  Don't nag, etc.  If he forgets to put those things in there, then you can do it.  He'll get the hang of it.  Most importantly, when he gets agitated, do not react.  He is venting his anxiety/frustration. This should help.  Good luck.  (My husband puts all those things next to the stove, except for the keys.  We have a separate "key basket" for all our keys.|`|e8dcbbdb9f4c6267514dc562bf234213aa	Never mind him, try to arrange everything together before the bed time, always ask him if everything is set for tomorrows work within 21days he will change.

I have no idea "what you mean" because my 13 year old is NOT ALLOWED to have a boyfriend!  I'm still the parent in my family and I intend to retain that title in my house!

And I got great advice that might see him for who he is. See when I was your daughters age I felt just the same for a boy in my school and I realized out in the real world that boys are not everything. They only hold you back from what you are trying to get at, boys at that age are immature and just a big waste to even have to try to start a relationship. It only make thing's worse and it will turn her into a sucker when she gets to high school and all will happen is she will just keep getting her heart broken over and over again until she learns the hard way out. And she has a long while yet to go until she will realize this. Just be open and explain to your daughter that she is only 13 and there are plenty of fish in the sea and that perfect boy or guy she has dreamed of will come along do waste it on some cocky boy at school who thinks he has a hold on her and feels he knows she will take him back when ever his side rack is gone .

She is at least a year or two away from being capable of dealing with these complex relationships.    Her self esteem is low, because she is emotionally unable to even HANDLE the whole boyfriend thing!  She is blaming herself because that is what little children DO! Get her into couseling NOW.  And make sure the counsellor knows just how foolish YOU have been!     I think you need to ask yourself if YOUR insecurities have pushed your daughter into inappropriate relationships. I suspect they caused you to allow this insane situation to develop in the first place. Maybe family counselling is in order as well.    I'm sorry if this sounds harsh and judgemental, I don't like the truth any more than you do. But someone needs to say this.|`|AA12048147	no disrespect intended but i have to say this..... this is what happens when girls have b/f's at such an early age..... this stuff that goes on these days just blows my old mind..... what are 13 yr old girls doing worrying about boys at this age ?? I was still playing with dolls for pets sake !!!!!! you need to find out what this boy has over her..... she is at the age to be easily impressed and brain washed by a guy....... MOM needs to sit down and have a real girl to girl talk about the TRUTH of relationships and the conseqense of having them..... what has she got to look forward to now ? if she is already having these problems at this age, what will the future bring ????? sorry to sound harsh, but this type of thing just makes me sad and a little mad...... let them children !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey, if she really wants to get together with this guy, it's not like you can really stop her.    When he breaks up with her again, she'll remember what you said, and at least she won't feel quite as bad. She'll remember what you said, and realize that the problem is with the boyfriend, not with her.    Aren't kids so much fun?

dff828883e3b40278f2e83acb5b0bd49aa	Seria possvel definir o amor?  Talvez, mas seriam tantas as defini??es, que precisariam ser publicadas em uma nova enciclopdia.  Pergunte a um homem apaixonado o que  o amor. Talvez ele responda que  uma faca de dois gumes, onde o lado de c te faz viver, mas quando menos se espera, pinta o cime e o lado de l te faz sofrer.  Pergunte ao religioso o que  o amor e talvez ele responda que somente Deus  amor, pois nos deu seu prprio filho para morrer por ns.  Pergunte a uma crian?a e talvez ela te responda que  o sentimento que vem de sua m?e, quando o medo do abandono a invade.  Pergunte ao faminto e talvez ele diga que  o gesto daquele que lhe d um peda?o de p?o, quando as for?as j n?o s?o capazes de sustent-lo.  Pergunte ao doente e talvez ele responda que  a pacincia da enfermeira a assisti-lo, quando a dor consome todo o seu ser.  Pergunte ao desempregado e talvez ele responda que  o ato de criar uma nova vaga naquela empresa, quando o desespero o faz lembrar da sua famlia, em volta da mesa vazia.  Pergunte ao pai e talvez ele diga que  o sorriso de seu filho, quando tudo em volta parece j perdido, sem jeito.  Pergunte a natureza e talvez ela diga que  a luta daquele grupo em prol de sua preserva??o, em meio a tanta destrui??o.  Pergunte ao sedento e talvez ele responda que  o sabor da gua a molhar sua garganta ressecada pela poeira da ingratid?o.  Pergunte a um amigo e talvez ele diga que  aquele abra?o no momento de dificuldade, quando se sente abandonado.  Pergunte ao intelectual e talvez ele lhe diga uma por??o de teorias decoradas, lidas em diversos best sellers.  Pergunte ao analfabeto e talvez ele apenas lhe d um sorriso, demonstrando seu amor pela vida.  Pergunte a mim e talvez nem lhe responda, pois n?o saberia quais palavras usar.  Pergunte a voc mesmo e me ajude a terminar este texto.|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	acho muito dificil definir o amor|`|38b5ec81e6657b7227486a36828b7f6daa	 a vontade de querer ser melhor a cada dia, s pra ver um sorriso no rosto dela....|`|207a9ee568e58b4c14f29e1be260f0f9aa	O amor  fogo,que arde sem se ver, ferida que di e n?o se sente, um contentamente descontente, um n?o contentar-se de contente...|`|8bfb3a945545d172b700e0df07d56ce3aa	primeiramente paix?o  bem diferente de amor  o amor demora pra acabar pode ser pisado e ta ali dentro do seu cora??o...   sentir o cora??o disparar, sorrir, sentir um embrulho no estomago, sei la  tudo isso e muito mais, n?o para de pensar na pessoa nem se quer um momento  querer ficar junto sem ir embora  tudo isso e principalmente n?o sofre eu sei que isso  quase impossivel mas tem como n?o sofrer de cair em lagrimas   de se magoar profundamente sim quando os dois realmente se aamam consegue superar tudo qualquer tipo de dificuldade que possa surgir com o tempo...|`|10149d484a5576eea9b413f6579c62e1aa	amor  qd vc n?o liga pra aparencias fsicas ou pro q os outros falam,  quando vc se sente feliz pelo q a pessoa  e significa pra vc e n?o pelo q ela te faz...  estar cheio de problemas, can?ado e a nica coisa q te vem a mente  estar com a pessoa q vc ama...|`|45d60bd80c430c622828896dc49ffed3aa	A MELHOR DEFINI??O DE AMOR QUE EU CONHE?O  UM SONETO DE LUIZ DE CAM?ES, TRANSFORMADA EM MSICA POR RENATO RUSSO:    Amor  fogo que arde sem se ver;   ferida que di e n?o se sente;   um contentamento descontente;   dor que desatina sem doer;     um n?o querer mais que bem querer;   solitrio andar por entre a gente;   nunca contentar-se de contente;   cuidar que se ganha em se perder;     querer estar preso por vontade;   servir a quem vence, o vencedor;   ter com quem nos mata lealdade.

She was my roommate in college and I was often wondering how would it be if I could kiss her and touch her. We were of course changing clothes in front of each other and use the bathroom, etc... with no problem. When I'd see her naked I'd feel like electric currents inside my p_ussy. After we did it, we opened up to each other and she admitted she was feeling the same, she was very curious, as well, and she loved to see me naked, as well. The first time with her, was a great experience. I totally opened up after that and I've been with both, men and women, since then. I am married now, and my hubby and I have a girlfriend living with us. We have a blast together. Feel free to contact me at ella87110@yahoo.com if you'd like to talk some more.

No estoy de acuerdo para nada con la idea preconcebida que tienes pues a tu edad ya debes tener un concepto de lo que es el amor, la fidelidad, el respeto, el compromiso y los lmites , y no creo que  cambies de forma de pensar por los comentarios que escuchas al respecto, el alejarnos de nuestros principios es una traicin contra nosotros mismos.. Pero es posible ser fiel en estos tiempos  aunque estemos en una sociedad de lo desechable y el amor ya no sea sinnimo de complementacin entre hombre y mujer.

(hijos)  2-   despus de los 40 todo lo que esta arriba debe bajar si no hace una rutina de ejercicio o cruja.  3-   que los intereses diarios personales con el tiempo se cambian.  4-    que con el tiempo la deje por una mas joven.  5-    y no menos importante debe cuidarse mucho personalmente y emocionalmente para estar a tu nivel.    Quizs hay otras preocupaciones pero esas son las mas comunes.  Debes analizar tu forma de ser si en realidad son compatible en muchas cosas y hacerle entender que en realidad quieres estar con ella pesar de lo que pueda pasar en un futuro.

5a2987a31eae9e0c3aab70fe0668b7feaa	Yes it can last, no matter  how you feel that it's not enough time. Cold hard fact to swallow, but it's true, so I won't tell you what you want to hear, since it appears that by asking this question you are hurt by your ex continuing on with her life, including getting a new relationship. Time does not matter, statistics don'' matter.     I don't want YOU to waste any time on this situation, and if it's really under your skin, kick back and if/when it does crash and burn, drink a beer over it, and celebrate some minut joy, briefly. Life goes on, relationships go on, it sometimes hurts. Seeing the enjoyment from a previous loved one, (when they have moved on) is very hard, but spending time indulging in the destruction is counterproductive, (not that I'm suggesting this at all.)     It's likely that your ex is experiencing the beginnings of what it's like to be out in the world again, back in the dating sphere. If it helps, because I recommend any and all coping mechanisms, remember all the stuff that bugged you about her, and just think to yourself,, dang that dude has to deal with all that. (Remember, even with Pamela Lee, there is someone sitting someone sitting somewhere saying "Been there, done that".) Relationships are all popsicles and sugar slides at the beginning, and everyone reaches the underlining of a person's character at some point.     Focus on you right now,, be wild, be free. Go bang a few chicks and recapture those glory days. This is your time to not have to answer to anyone.. you've got it made. Be adventurous, discover yourself,, you have no limitations. Cash that paycheck and head to the strip bar and blow your twenties on some pretty girls,, drink some brews with the guys, go fishing and come in smelly, go hunting and stay gone for the entire weekend,, walk around naked in the house and don't wash your laundry for two weeks,, heck no one is around to nag you.. make sloppy joes and eat Top ramen noodles,, who cares, you're back to being a bachelor,, okay, once you're all done with that,, settle down,, get grounded, clean yourself up and really make yourself marketable to that special someone out there waiting for you. It's not the end of the world,, it's just the end of a relationship. Remember when you dated and you ended it? You moved on,, unfortunately we carry that stigma when we get married and place more value on it, about ending it,, GET OVER IT. Trust me, you can marry 5 times if you want and divorce 4,, who cares,, it's all about you,, move on,, she has,, I don't want you spending one moment with your thoughts on her .. get mad,, gain your strenght back,, YOU'RE A MAN,, don't whine (not suggesting you are) about her moving into some dudes house.., bring a honey over this evening, regain your self confidence,, you've got it anyway,, just a slight visit in dumpsville, but it's time to take a detour.     I know you're a HOT hunk of man meat, and it's time to reclaim that title that has sat like a dusty ole trophy the whole duration of your previous relationship.. now,, go out and see the world.. YOU GO KILLA,, it's all about you now. ~All in good fun, and I wish you my best.|`|AA11688662	it could, i mean it has been 8 months, its no longer a rebound thing|`|2c002b64d38f097a911139bcbd1416edaa	not on your life......................|`|58e8fd1ce44ce9c02802268a0c1b9234aa	You should stop worrying about her and go out and have some fun yourself.|`|ef5eca1927a9924cd2a23f6027647fa9aa	Who cares?

aa2c58d57ae7153375ef7cca1a448e8daa	It may hurt, but he was using you. People will only use you if you allow them too. Do not let yourself get caught up in the emotions of some guy who is not for you and cares nothing about you. Guys do stupid stupid things for stupid stupid reasons. Value yourself, know who you are and be proud of YOU. Quit focusing on some guy who is beneath you. It may be hard right now, but be patient, look outside your box, there is a whole world out there waiting for you to live it. I have been depressed in years past, but I have seen happier days and I know you will too.|`|AA12257113	Dear Child, he went with you for three days because he was separated from the girl he 'loves' and wanted to show her how easy it was for him to get another girl!    That's the stupid way ignorant boys (and too many men) prove their love; why just hurt one when you can hurt two for the same price?    Your sadness is understandable.  I am not certain if I have heard of you through your friend, although it is possible.    What is apparant is that you want help for a variety of complications.    Please take a deep breath.    Close your eyes and take another deep breath.    Put both of your feet solidly on the floor and sit as upright as you are able on a straight back chair.  If you cannot find a straight back chair, then just sit erectly on the flattest bottom chair you have.  Sit with the crown of your head in alignment with your straight and erect back.    Take another deep breath.    Place both of your palms on the top of each of your legs about a finger length back from your knee cap.    Take another deep breath. Breathe.  Just breathe. Keep breathing until you feel a calmness come over you followed by a tingling touch of energy.    Now, get up and lift your hands toward the sky!  Swing your arms!  Move your torso!  Feel that breath!  Live that energy!  Smile!    Clear your mind of friends and postings and pseudo boyfriends.  Breath.  Clear your mind.  Feel your energy.  Know that your energy is completely untapped life.  Your life.    Breathe.    If you need prescribed meds to feel better then I suggest taking them.  I take a variety myself.  They don't make me feel stoned but they do get my mind to a place where I can breathe.    Good luck, baby sister.    Breathe.|`|04f3b89701e6cce40c2749bc64cf731faa	forget about him, that's always a better one..|`|515c6e245859ce6d7c6a52565aa72a32aa	he's in love with another girl then move on girl|`|AA10458399	This boy may have just been trying to find out if he had those 'feelings' for you. Relationships are all about trying to work together, and unfortunately, this one didn't work out. Don't stress out over it, though. Finding a decent boyfriend takes patience, cooperation, and it also takes effort on BOTH sides to make it work.

But if he's showing you that he cares often enough then do you really need to hear the exact words, actions can be enough.

You need to go for the guy you like and not apologize for liking someone. That's just ridiculous!

Find better friends who will be happy when you are...she seems like she only thinks of herself and is happy when you're alone and miserable.

Find something else to do to occupy your time - leave your sister alone - what you have said about her is very hurtful and one day when the world sucks, your friends stuff you up (it's bound to happen to all of us at some stage) and your family isn't around, you will both turn to each other and wonder why the hell you let this silly fight go on.|`|4ca615e4c0e89e6fab19473e33df7df9aa	Perhaps you should be a little clearer on why you feel this way.

Thanks.

One can be that they were never really that happy and were sticking it out. One big reason is that men after being married are afraid to be alone and lonely. They don't deal with their emotions as well as women and being alone is difficult. Plus, there are so many women to men out there that they have women practically hounding them as soon as they are back out there. 23 men is alot do you work in a funeral home?

He has been married 4 times and is working on number five. They are waiting on her divorce to be final.He is a man that has to have women in his life to be happy. And in the process loses his identity, to concentrate on her to keep her happy no matter the cost. So he alienates his now 13 year old son and 11 year old daughter.  HE has done this before with these kids and also my wife and her sister.|`|AA12100644	Not sure about all that, but gosh you know a lot of men!!|`|AA11503396	That's a good question.

cc116eb6eb42ef1f9a6dfe6a047f8b7aaa	Depends on how well you know your gf. If you know her well and are SURE you love your ex more, go for ex. But why is she your ex? Who broke it off? Your ex might not want a bar of you so if you break off with your gf and your ex is over you, you're left with no one..for the time being.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	ONLY YOU CAN ASWER THIS QUESTION, BUT IF SHE  YOUR EX, THEN WHY ARE THINKING THAT  IF YOU GET  BACK TOGETHER THAT THINGS WONT BE THE SAME.  AND YOU WILL HAVE LOST SOMEONE SPECAIL IN YOUR  LIFE RIGHT NOW. SOMETIME YOU NEED TO SEE WHAT  RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. TO APPRECIATE  WHAT YOU GOT. WHEN IT GONE IT GONE. THE PAST  IS JUST THAT THE PAST. MOVE FORWARD TO THE   PRESENT. AND THE FUTURE.|`|5ec89d89efaf69538142a30726089e60aa	I think you need to be away from both women for a while. Its obvious that you like them both. You feel love for the first gf because she is so familiar to you plus all the good memories still fresh in your mind.    I think the best way for you and fair also to your new gf is to give them both up for the time being. After that, you should take some time to reevaluate the situation by yourself.    Whatever you do, make sure that your action is the conclusion of your own thinking.|`|1f1a8ea894ff86ff5888a00ffcd38598aa	The question now is: will she take U back? What made u break off with her in the first place if you're so in love with her. it is very unfair for your current gf. i think u are not ready for girls yet.   take time off to chill out and discover your innerself.|`|271be723954db02cf627996e6a7bd803aa	you do what your heart tells you to do but it also depends on why is your ex girlfriend your ex in the first place if you still love her like that|`|8980e797850ff1dd5ebd027e1f17a1baaa	maybe you just think about your ex because she's not yours anymore, sometimes we tend to miss the things we gave up but could'nt figure out if we still need it... give more time to yourself, maybe you just miss the things you used to do together... there could be better qualities your new girlfriend has yet to reveal, give her a chance or you might lose both and end up still wondering...  Good Luck!!|`|d2865f2df6edc49055209f21c608449faa	And why is she your ex?  She is your ex because it didn't work.  What makes you think it will work this time?  I think people want what they can't have.  The minute you get back with your ex, you'll realize that nothing has really changed.  Move on and focus on your new love.|`|be4764b9f3f4b777d55ec703e4c22307aa	Don't you wish you can combine them together? But the reality is that you have to make up your mind and stick to your promises CuZ otherwise, in the end, you might lose them both. What happened b/t you and your ex was only between you two. If you still want to have a relationship with her, you have to deal with the problem before you make any promises. If you want to a different experience with you current gf, then stop talking to your ex. Give your current girlfriend a chance. It's about YOU!!!|`|AA11981358	Just remember you can never go back to once was, if you get back together with your ex, it will not be the same as before. You may be better off staying with the new girlfriend and trying to avoid whatever mistakes you and your ex made................|`|AA11286352	If youre between 16-25, i'd go with the new chik. This is your time to experiment, take advantage of it.

AA10832878	So they will hopefully grow up to be mature, responsible,  and "self-disciplined" people themselves, and feel that "same" importance of raising "their" children with   discipline also.

Children of all ages need predictability.  They have so little control of their lives, that it's important for them to know what's coming.     A connection of action -> consequence is realized.  My one year old knows that when I take her outside she can run, touch, smell etc but if she puts anything in her mouth we go back home.  Does she keep doing it?  Yes every now and then. But at the same time she knows what's coming and why.  Discipline does not mean beating your child or yelling at them, just rules that have predictable consequences for breaking them.    People think that children want to do whatever they want but they need and want our guidance.  Structure makes them feel more protected.    I've read in one of the parenting magazines not too long ado that the current generation lacks self control and that's why we are so unhappy - all out lives teachers, parents etc tell us how wonderful we are, but out in the real world people don't treat you the same way.  So although we send a positive message to our kids that they are great, we forget to teach them self control and that's where addictions, depressions, inability to handle things in life etc come from.|`|e352d74460a4e7f7ab88976bf730d080aa	as imp. as driving within the lanes on road... no discipline means no proper life... accidents are bound to happen|`|AA11777294	to prepare them for life.|`|c9d9e5d49eb9282b39ec3ea3bbbf3f8aaa	Discipline gives the kids some structure in their lives.  Kids need this structure. It makes them feel safe as they know what they can and cannot do. What is expected and what is not.  Without that structure, they have no boundaries which is like a ship without a destination.  Somewhat like walking in the dark.  Nowadays people confuse discipline with abuse.  You do not have to abuse a child in order to discipline them.

I  completely understand how you feel but is okay to branch out and be with friends, these should be some of the best and most carefree days of a child's life. let him live it but make sure he is smart and safe. People at this age do sometimes change up there habits at least this one's potentially a good one. One more thing that may make you feel a lot more comfortable is to know his friends have them come hang out at your place and that way you can attempt to get to know the people that he is around; but make sure the atmosphere is cool so that you can get the best possible picture of his friends and not just some kind of a front!

Per tu dovresti sentirti libera di tirar fuori quello che senti, cio sentiti libera di dirgli cosa pensi a riguardo...non sono d' accordo che riguardi solo i tuoi, riguarda anche te, loro si ritroveranno senza un compagno, per scelta, ma tu ti ritroverai senza un genitore e non per scelta tua, posso dirti di non giudicarli e di volergli bene a prescindere da come andranno le cose, solo, parlane con loro digli cosa provi, magari non servir a nulla o forse si, almeno tu avrai fatto la tua parte!!!  ti sono vicina!  un bacione|`|c0b42e36deca096050037e6bc22ed185aa	spesso  la soluzione migliore.....|`|aeb5db6597cb172d56224a6d85defe65aa	Nulla tesoro, puoi solo fargli capire che ti dispiace e stargli vicini entrambi.. sicuramente loro sono pi disperati di te..

Lo so che dispiace ma avere genitori separati non vuol dire non avere genitori. Non creare loro dei sensi di colpa inutili. Se non si amano piu' e' giusto che si rifacciano una vita, non essere egoista. Vedrai che riuscirai a stabilire un nuovo tipo di rapporto con ciascuno di loro, piu' sereno e consapevole di quello di prima.

AA12059569	You can't help who your attracted to.  And since your attracted to and open to relationships with women of all ethnic backgrounds your more likely to find true love and have a lasting relationship because you don't let color cloud your judgment.  Don't ever let anyone tell you who to like or not to like.  Do what is most comfortable for you.  I wish you luck in finding a woman to complete you.|`|AA10699062	Shrug, you like what you like.  Who are we to say what's right or wrong for you?  Dating, sexual preference, etc., are all very personal choices.  Since you have friends of all races, you don't discriminate, so I see no problem.  Just don't close your mind to possibilities - who knows what you'll discover!

Everyone is different so no one can say when she will give it up.    Maybe she will wait till she is married.  Maybe she is just afraid of how painful it will be; You know it hurts us the first time.    Girls don't realize the strength of the male sex drive, so she doesn't know how difficult it can be for you; you may want to talk about that with her.|`|a1ef0b32bf3a549c3afc8dc8895660caaa	not a lot of girls i know relent on their beliefs and something tells me she's no different. if you respect her decision to wait until she's married why do you want to speed things up?|`|b8c1ea58036720a9d9985db783c7febdaa	you just have to wait for her, if she feels ready to "go all the way" with you, then she will. I always said I was going to wait until I was married, but I was in a committed relationship and I lost my virginity way before I was married. I am not sayin gshe will change her mind, but she might, just give her time. When she fells comfortable or ready to do it, it will be worth the wait for you and her. Good Luck with her.|`|AA11436470	Respect her wishes and enjoy the time you spend together. 'Giving that up' as you say, is very immature. Love her, and she will give you more than you could possibly dream, if you are willing to look at the big picture. If the making out is making you lust for more....wait till she leaves, and well....you know what to do.|`|f86d642ac0d3f8429f4cb6506f28df50aa	You should respect her decision on waiting until she is married. That shows she has alot of self respect. I wouldn't pressure her or try to speed anything up. Its either keep doing all the things you do in the bedroom, and try to be stronger when it comes to the point of going all the way, or don't let it get that far. Especially far enough where you can't control it. I know it is probably hard for you, to resist when she is coming on so strong and making you think she wants it, then just when you think it will happen, she backs down. That's called lighting the match and then blowing it out, before it has had time to burn.....I would talk to her and be honest, ask her if it is as hard for her to not do it as it is on you. She will when she is ready....Good luck and take care!|`|eec846e9aaa518ce108d28d59c017086aa	My friend, sorry to say, but you are in a relationship that will not work.  Here are the two most likely outcomes.    1. She gives it up to you and will feel guilty about it and will resent you for it and then break up with you.    2. She will not have sex with you and after another 3 or 4 months you will break up with her.

What the hell are you waiting for? Will you only tell her after she meets someone else and then only regret not letting her know sooner? Go on and tell her how you feel, you never know she might surprise you and tell you she feels the same way. Its worth a try. Go for her brother.|`|AA11778516	just leave her alone...she's happy in her new relationship...find someone who will return the love|`|78907c5058cb9ab281a7cd4e96a9670baa	Make a move or let it go......ok|`|b9d99e70d48b93dea981c62754e14392aa	Play around with her, take her to the movies, go out places.

Consider yourself blessed that you saw his bad side so soon. Imagine what a nightmare he would have been to live with.    Be happy you have good memories, but happier that you didn't commit to a long-term living hell.    With this attitude, you may find you can treat him with a friendly but detached manner at work. If he is unpleasant, ignore it and rise above it. If he is small-minded, and in a position above you, you may have to get a new job, but do that on your own terms.    Don't bring it up.

You gotta remember that it's a job, so leave your personals at the doorstep. And it's not gonna be easy believe me. But all I can tell you is to occupy your time, and take your mind away from it... Hell, act like you got a secret admirer. Send yourself flowers (if you got the money) Because believe me, when men get over the hump, they're over and on someone else... You did the right thing by walking away... If he's gonna keep on accusing you of something that you didn't do he's insecure and might have something to hide his damn self.

If you had married and one of you became a manager of the other. Bad thing.    From your perspective it is a bad thing because you do have to see him every day. Never a good idea to fall in love with someone at work. It makes a breakup twice as hard.    So what to do? You have done the right thing. If he would not listen to you about something like this it would only get worse if you got closer or married. He sounds very jealous and does not trust that you are telling him the truth.     As hard as it may be never go back. You will be sorry. Move on and find someone who will believe you about anything until you prove to be un-trustworthy. You will not be faced with this again.  And find them outside of work please.

You know how kool is to have lots of friends and if they r all over the world is better. When guys are insecure they use any excuse to make the girlfriend believe every thing she does is wrong. you shouls dump him before he tries to dump u again and get someone better that knows that having friends is important.

And yes, he will certainly pick up on what you are thinking, but you are to scared to ask. But please don't ask him.............. leave things alone, and enjoy what time you do spend together. And you know what Smarty, "whats meant to be, will be".     Hugs  Texas girl|`|6a6086b2996985e57de03e16c5597258aa	You sound insecure (and irrational) about yourself and your man...if you continue this way - you will lose him and make your anxiety a self-fulfilling prophecy.  You cannot hold onto love by holding on.  You have to get used to having some things out of your control - it is the way the world works.   Here is another truth and that is most long distance relaitonships don't survive...|`|AA12349536	I have been through that situation before. It sounds like you have faith & trust in him but you don't have any for yourself. That is not good. When you become involved with someone it is great to have confindence in that person. But you also have to have confidence in yourself as well. And if you don't have confidence in yourself or you have lack of confidence in the relationship. The relationship that the two of you have together will only end up in tourment and make you feel even less about yourself then you already do. I know that that is how I felt. So the best thing that you can do is to get out of the relationship if you are having doubts about it. Because believe me, even though he may be a nice guy and you don't think that you have to worry about him cheating on you, you really do. Because when he see's that you are having a lack of confidence in yourself,that is when he will begin to start taking advantage of the situation. And the reason for that is because he thinks that you trust and have complete faith in him and you don't/won't blame him  for anything that happens, you will only blame your self and always keep him in your life until he is tired of it and he decides to leave. I don't know if you are in this predicament or not, but I only wanted to tell you this because it had happend to me before, and I've learned that it is best to have true love, faith, trust, & confidence in your self as well as the man that you get involved with. Because if you don't have those things, then you should not be in the relationship to begin with!   Good Luck!|`|8a8ca5d1cb1c37a29a936d2da0eaf66daa	Love is the answer to everything. All you ever need is love,  communication and understanding. That's what I figured out so  far. If you are down, you need to get up and start doing something with  your life.

You're not alone, everyone is afraid of getting hurt, but sometimes we need to take that leap of faith to reach want we want.    Just keep in mind what it is you want. Do you want to love him, or do you not want to get hurt.    Good luck with that, hope you find your happiness.

Exemple : si la douche est trs troite, genre : tout seul on se cogne dj partout. Alors la rponse est NON.     Plus srieusement, il s'agit d'attirance et de respect abitrs par le contr?le de soi.  Si la personne est attirante et qu'on n'coute que son envie, la rponse est NON.  Si on sait se contr?ler par respect pour l'autre personne, la rponse est OUI  Mais il se peut aussi qu'il n'y ait aucune attirance, au contraire et la rponse est OUI sans difficults (sauf le cas de douche exige biens?r...)    Enfin, une remarque sur la prcision "du sexe oppos" mentionn dans la question : tout dpend de la sexualit des deux personnes.    Conclusion, la rponse est OUI|`|ec07ce43175c04758b59d0e9cc9f1047aa	Pour rpondre ta douche est elle assez grande pour recevoir deux personnes.

Paix?o: do latim passione = sofrimento, sentimento excessivo;  afeto violento; entusiasmo, clera, grande mgoa; vcio dominador; alucina??o; sofrimento intenso (lembra-se? PAIX?O de Cristo)    Paix?o, j no vocabulrio grego deriva de paschein, padecer uma determinada a??o ou efeito de algum evento.  algo que acontece  pessoa independente de sua vontade ou mesmo contra ela. De paschein deriva pathos e patologia. Pathos designa tanto emo??o como sofrimento e doen?a.    Amor, na verdade,  um s, a diferen?a est no que as pessoas julgam estar sentindo. Muitas pessoas interpretam EMO??ES fortes como sendo amor, porm o SENTIMENTO verdadeiro n?o causam brigas, cimes, inveja, discrdia, nada disso decorre do verdadeiro amor.     Esse tipo de sentimento  resultado do nosso EU, da nossa vontade, dos nossos desejos, enfim, do nosso egosmo e nada mais alm disso. O sofrimento nunca ser sinal de amor. Quando o amor  real ele tudo espera, tudo cr, tudo suporta... o verdadeiro amor jamais acaba.    Enfim Paix?o  emo??o, amor sentimento...    Voc pensa que emo??es e sentimentos s?o sin?nimos?    - quando  Amor o que voc sente - n?o importa por quem  ou pelo qu - a sensa??o  t?o agradvel, que voc n?o  sente o mnimo desejo de se livrar dela.  O Amor  sentimento. Sentimento faz bem.    - quando  dio, voc pode notar que  como se o seu peito se  fechasse, o ar parece ser insuficiente para sua oxigena??o.  A respira??o fica ofegante e curta.  uma sensa??o horrvel.  O dio  emo??o. Emo??o faz mal.     comum confundirmos pessoas sentimentais com pessoas  emotivas e pensamos que  a mesma coisa, mas n?o :  a pessoa sentimental n?o sofre, mas a emotiva sim.  Emocionar-se  "doer-se".  Emo??o  rudo. Sentimento  silncio.    A paix?o  emo??o e, s por isso,  faz tanto estardalha?o, tanto estrago no continuar das coisas.  H quem mate "em nome do Amor", mas h um engano:  a paix?o pode fazer matar, mas o Amor n?o.    H um incontvel nmero de coisas que sentimos e  que s?o confundidas, ora com sentimento, ora com emo??o.    S?o emo??es: dio, a inveja, o cime, vingan?a, ressentimento, a culpa, a mgoa, a raiva, e por a a fora.    Voc notou como tudo isso  denso, pesado, sufocante?  As emo??es nos prendem, os sentimentos nos libertam.    N?o h necessidade de eu listar o que s?o sentimentos,  pois voc - com certeza - j percebeu que eles s?o  exatamente tudo que  o oposto dos listados acima.

After that, start flirting wit him. Now dont ask wat to say when you flirt coz, its human nature. If you dont know how to flirt, THEN YOURE WEIRD.|`|f1daea4142338164de85affb874abf6eaa	don't. it sounds like he's not that into you. if he was, he'd start the flirting. Believe me, you'll figure out who is interested. They will show you with facial epressions, verbal clues, and try to talk to you. whoever hangs around you likes you. whoever contacts you with stupid excuses or suddenly pops in with tickets to stuff his "friend or mother" gave him likes you. You  first have to evaluate if he has even noticed you. then assuming he HAS you have to check out if he's dating material. Do you have a solid friendship in place? (no.) ok, you ruled that out. you need to get that in place first. after you do that THEN you move on to the flirting. THEN you move on to the dating. There's a formula here. It's sound to me like he does not want the job of dating you. (yes it's a job and he is not submitting his application.). in order to submit his application, he needs to indicate interest. and he is clearly not doing that.

dba5f4fca2819e933f18ef88d4994e35aa	totally, he's just shy to approach u. maybe he feels   u won't be comfortable around him. go and say hi if he's worth the effort. be nice to him but don't send him too many signals. just let him do that and just be a little receptive|`|96bd36ad92b997dfe82a2e78dcbadb5caa	He probablly does like you or thinks you're cute. He probablly ignores you because he's nervous about talking to you. That's guys for ya. If you like him maybe you should try to talk to him and make him more comfortable around you. But if you dont like him ask him "What the hell are you staring at?"|`|a2268525c14b2cd97f00ce9e296af26caa	It was just a booty call, probably not meant to be.

Sometimes (just like girls) guys play hard to get. We do this because we get tired of being "old fashioned" and always making the first move.  So go ahead, make the first move, and make fun of him later after you guys are in a relationship. hahaha. Good luck!|`|7e93c8ae2870f2afdb6338542707db20aa	Well, maybe.  It sounds like you have certain physical attributes that he finds appealling, but he doesn't have the confidence to approach you in a manner that would allow both of you to connect and get to know one another on a personal level.      If you're interested in him, maybe you could find a way to break the ice which would give him an opening to start conversing with you and making eye contact.  From there, who knows?|`|AA12357983	was your fly open?|`|983e05a65a7b83f487bfd4341ec00ce9aa	Yeah he probably does, but once he noticed you had caught him in the act, he is embarrased to do it again.|`|44f034501ad809521e7cb29e11bcfa10aa	its the staring game. hes testing you i think. he'll stare at you, and you can feel his eyes on you out of the corner of your eye and when you sweep your peepers over the area hes sittng in he looks away, right? yeah, kinda confusing. he's mixed on you. make a silly face at him and see what he does or something really strange.|`|AA11305306	I think so, I always get that feeling from the guy I like, so of course I'm going to be biased and say yes. But put yourself in his shoes, it's not like he's completely oblivious to the fact that you're always staring at him, no one wants to be caught staring at someone. Also, you can't look at a person if they're already staring at you. Try smiling at him if he stares at you again, it will throw him offgaurd, and it's really the best flirting you can do with a guy who stared at you.|`|7c916ebb07b78bf5f400bf4629e79787aa	He is sending mixed signals to spike your interest. And, from your question, it definitely worked.|`|e9ac31e3ae30ffa23e0ed38205b14099aa	Ya he likes you coz thats exactly what i do.

AA11932760	It might appear from FOX news that terrorism is spread all over the world, but in fact many countries do not have a terrorist problem.    The root of terrorism is the desire to instill fear.  Those who wish to instill fear are those who wish to keep citizens subjugated, because frightened citizens are easy to control.  The ones with the greatest desire for this are those with a desire to control the whole planet.  These are known as the Illuminati, or New World Order.  They already have immense control over governments, because they control the money.  They own the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.  Because they have so much power, they have control over the secret services, and use them as a tool to further their agenda.  It is the secret services who conduct most of the terrorist acts.  They also stir up trouble in order to start wars, another form of terrorism.|`|f5888d532f37b2f14c2801dac02b6487aa	Because all sorts of people have violent ideologies. It's that simple.

They don't have the guts to declare war and keep the fighting between armies.  They are like "Wife Abusers."   They go after the weaker people, who aren't trained or able to fight back, instead of going up against someone who could kick their arses from here to kingdom come.    They are so jealous of countries having more success than theirs, blaming these countries for their failures and inadequacies.  They are intent on blaming anyone but themselves for their failures and refuse to take responsibility for their actions by blaming God - saying it's what he wants them to do.      They are so arrogant, they actually believe their failures are someone elses fault.  They are raised to believe women are of no importance and that the world owes them everything and, of course, that they are always right.  They are like spoiled children, throwing a tantrum because not everything is going their way and acting like they have the right to do whatever they please, to whom ever, and trying to force their beliefs down the throats of everyone who doesn't bow down to them and their so-called religion, believing they are the only ones who have the right to decide what is and isn't wrong.  Just don't anyone give them a taste of their own medicine.  Kind of like double standards or being two-faced.    As for it being spread all over the world - In the past, travel across the world wasn't as easy as it is now, so terrorism was kept close to home but now, access to places is as easy as a plane ticket.  They're trying to run the world their way - and it's easier for them than it was for the Romans, the Huns or even Hitler!

AA11250613	For thee 12 yr. old sake I sure hope it is. The 24 yr. old is molesting a child, no matter what country it might be. Be a child as long as you can. It goes by so fast & you will be an adult for a long time. You will have plenty of time then to make your mistakes & pay the consequences. So slow down & be a little girl as long as you can. Being an adult isn't all that great.|`|9bfd38c4f34e4912768a91622fc57a55aa	yes, its illegal    and its also stupid.    dont be stupid kid, this guy is old enough to be your dad, if he was active at 12-13|`|AA12261667	whY?|`|AA10109044	Only if the couple's gay.

No matter how stupid.Spend all week thinking of something special for the weekend and then... do it! Sitting outside under that stars and say, "I have never felt so special before... I owe this to you. I love you."

I think how you process your grandmother's death has a lot to do with your theory about life and the order of things.     I have lost my father, my brother, my favorite aunt and my great grandmother. I lost my father and brother as a young teenager. When it first happened, I was fatalistic about it. I believed that everything that happens is supposed to happen. Then, as I got older, I built on that view b/c my beliefs changed. I believe that people are on earth to learn certain lesson and help certain other people learn and that ever their deaths were part of the plan. Some would say my beliefs are convenient, but I think most people's beliefs are.     In the end, how you deal with this will be determined by why you think we as humans are on earth to begin with. That and just going through the pain of the loss which cannot be avoided or suppressed. The pain will lift someday soon.|`|90aae0c0f4b1f587e9ac82f7fdefe2c3aa	i've been told it takes time to greive,but how much time I don't know .Just hang in there.

I finally told his family thatt hey were making it hard for the two of us and that it was my husbands choice not to be a party to it and they should discuss this with him.  They did and he told them that rather than be a party to it he would rather not be around them.  You are his wife and a unit unto yourselves.  The extendd family is just that extended.  Hang in there, back one another in this decision not to partake in the bashing, when it starts the two of you hand in hand walk away, and maybe they will get the hint and stop.

It must really be hard on you if you feel like you have to seperate. Communication is key in these situations..if you dont tell him whats up with you its just going to build and build until you end up dropping a bomshell on his world he has built around you. No...confide in him now, tell him how you feel, learn to rely on eachother and dont let outsiders come into YOUR family and ruin it. Really though communication with your husband is what is going to dispell these feelings of splitting. If you confide with eachother about these kind of things...you will make it through so much that would otherwise destroy a couple that does not communicate well, and you will be stronger each time something comes up and you both get through it together.

Todo el rito previo del romance, la seduccin, las miradas, las caricias, el sorprender a la persona que se ama, es un contexto asombroso  y  embriagante.  Personalmente, no me agrada el sexo sin un romance previo mnimo. Y te cuento que hoy en da es toda una complicacin, pues cuando algn amigo me presenta una amiga de la esposa o algo parecido, el "tuch and go" o el sexo en la primera cita parece casi una prescripcin mdica urgente, y si no la acatas quedas como un lenteja.  Y a mi me agrada lo que cuesta, lo que se va dando de a poco, la conquista de a pedacitos de la persona que te interesa, este "romance" es la magia que la de brillo a una vinculacin, y el sexo es la sublime culminacin de dicho romance.

AA11708733	Honestly, she might just like to flirt. When some people get nervous around others, particularly for women, they go into flirt mode. It's normal, and not a rather good idea to read too much into it. If she really had a thing for you, she would have made a move on you a long time ago or tomorrow. If she does make a move, tell your brother, but only after it's definite she has made a move on you; like inviting you to a sleepover or planting one right on the lips!|`|34a8e9c4a2160f397ff1dc7ee2b65cf2aa	talks differently means|`|60194d50cc7e3a9aa8e9dcda02fb5d0caa	great.let her do what she want to do u just enjoy, it is all free for u.best of luck|`|33884eebf32b6470550f8e0fb1f77517aa	Sounds like she may have a little crush on you.

If you create strif between you and your brother, you will have to live with that.  A girlfriend can come and go, but brothers are forever.    If you have feelings for her too, then issues arise.

Her as well, cause people hate being surprised by an aligation.|`|e01e19a2744d669350a583bb49a108f5aa	WOAH!!!!|`|e6b404d94dc173f8ed9319976f79eedeaa	bros com first, remember that and it will get far!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|c2a0eeec8c26b3b52a2439e6bcc8ae85aa	Let me say this one thing, I had the same thing happen to me.

I bet $100.00 that it will not get back to your brother and she will still be your friend if she any feelings at all for your brother.|`|6f1e2d9a777825cb05f1b3f7fb9cebdfaa	The only way to know for sure is to ask her. Since she is your brothers girlfriend I would leave her alone don't even bother. Your brother should be more important to you than some HOE.

I know how you feel but the thing that helps me is meditating and praying on a regular basis. I suggest writing a letter to your mother letting her know how you feel that she left so soon. Get it all out and I promise you will feel better.

Good luck and although it is really early and anniversaries are the hardest.  Keep going and make it as positive as you can.   It's choices we make on "How to".............!|`|b92b56509cb33d315a045227adc6dc2daa	It is very natural that you are missing her. It is something that we all have to go through once in our lives. I would suggest that you talk with the people who you love and you think that they care for you. Importantly, avoid loneliness. Try meeting people and help yourself by indulging in activities such as socializing and exercise. You can as well start dedicating some of your work (such as writing, or any casual hobies) to her. Let your emotions out and again avoid being alone. That will never help you.|`|dd30f9f07591c4e2aafcf46d6ff22818aa	Sorry to hear about this, I myself did experience the loss of a loved one and it hurts especially at that exact moment in time. I think that the best thing that you can do is remember the good times. A mother is someone that can never be replaced. GOD brings his children home at some point and hey she may be content there, and may not want you to be so down in your spirits. Remembering her may be  hard especially at a times like this, just pray and talk to her who knows what the unknown world is about maybe she hears you!!!  Celebrate her life when she was here and all of the great contributions she has made in your life and all that she has given and taught you and you can hopefully pass it on to your offspring's. B/c she had you, you are a part of her, and you should remember and embrace that!!!  Hope this helps!!!!!|`|fcebae8b7b63bdb2463ce9e8bd4177a6aa	My heart goes out to you!  I lost my mother 3yrs ago and I to have a terrible time.  But, there is joy in my bittersweet memories.  Time is the next best healer, God being first. I think you know that you lost your mother before a year ago.  Your mourning could be tempered with guilt and/or anger.  It is never easy to lose an anchor as our parent at any age!  If it is okay, make a special box, book or video to put memories in, catalog everything that comes into you heart!  Words, songs, pics, poems. Any and everything!  Then go someplace and treasure every piece. Cry, sing, laugh and talk to and with her.  Then set this somewhere in your heart. Share it when you finally feel safe to. Never feel guilty when you wish to be selfish with it and hold it close. Do all this when you can or just make a special time. Then feel free to let her go.  Because you'll still have her in your special place forever.        May Gods Will in your life never be questioned|`|AA11149006	I am sorry for your loss.  But, you have to have some gratitude that she is not suffering anymore.  That is a terrible disease.  Be glad she isn't suffering.|`|AA12057390	You might have a dinner in her honor. Have family and friends over and invite them to cook and bring your mom's favorite foods and deserts.   Bring out pictures and mementos and tell favorite stories. Be thankful!  I don't believe that time heals; you will always miss her and feel the loss. But you'll also always feel the connection, right? Be thankful.  Hope this helps!|`|0e10d922e17224416236f7fdb7ddb32eaa	god is doing every thing with some purpose, so leave it to the god. !!!|`|c29e34623e653facbed695ecc24221ceaa	GATHER WITH YOUR LOVED ONES !!!

97d23e87315dcae1d92406725a4fe71baa	You make plenty of sense, but the sad truth is, there's not going to be any 'right time' for you to discuss commitment and him not decry it and invalidate your feelings with the blanket of 'You're pushing me!'  Men have done it since the dawn of time, it seems, and society has built up fierce constructs in re-inforcing it.  In my humble opinion, what you should do is sit him down, discuss with him what he wants out of life, what you want out of life, and that you're ready to take the next step... whether it's a promise (or promise ring), engagement, ect.  If he starts emotionally running around with his pants on fire, say sayonara, and immerse yourself in your pool of more mature friends where you're more likely to find what it is you need and want.    I definitely, rabidly disagree with anyone who says "Oh wait for him to come around", because his 'someday' could be 'doomsday' and your 'never day'.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	it doesn't sound like he has a problem with commitment at all. He finished high school, he's stuck with college, he's been with the same girl for 3 years. It just sounds like you want different things in your lives right now. You don't need to sugarcoat this-- just have an honest discussion. Tell him what you want, expect and need from the relationship. Either he'll be able to give it to you or not.  If you're afraid of sounding pushy and are worried he might dump you for asking, you might want to rethink this relationship.  Say, "I need to know if you see us married in 2 years"- and just be honest and open. I mean-- if you're hoping to marry him, you two should be able to have a serious conversation without the drama or arguments.    Frankly, if you need to ask how to talk to your boyfriend, and what to say to him about a future together, I wonder.|`|AA12177442	Focus on yourself.  What aside from marriage/engagement would provide you the security your seeking in your relationship?    Try to think outside the box.  I think you goal should be to identify something other than marriage or engagement that will make you feel like more than just boyfriend and girlfriend.       Marriage isn't the solution.|`|3c524ef8204655765d874fcbb5c9adecaa	Guys dont freak out about commitment for no reason. Ask him about it in a non-threatening way. Say to him "help me understand why you feel...."  However, if he wants to keep you, he should also let you know that he's interested in KEEPING you. Good luck.|`|1bee89b3113c70ad9cda307fde231528aa	well i've been with my bf for a year and a half now..commitment? well i guess i dnt knwo what to say but maybe give him time?|`|7e4599a5be3757f13b09e27ad38bce80aa	Yeah it makes alot of since.  Ask him something like "where do you see yourself in 5 years" or "what are your future plans with me" or "do you see us together for life".  If it is just obvious that he has no interest in any commitment at all (now or later), then maybe you need to explore other options!|`|AA12012295	you have already given him everything i presume-why would he want to marry you.?|`|3fb18746062cc0d61890e38f138df7cfaa	if you really want to be with the guy and he doesn't seem intrested in the long lasting commitement your pretty much wasting your time with him. as much as you love him you should be with someone who is at your level of thinking and feels the same way you do about the commitement of a relationship... most guys at college just are intrested in having a good time. they can completely change from being an amazing guy to the dumbest guy possible. alittle bit of freedom can make or break someone at college cuz guys go all out getting drunk having sex with random girls etc. find a way to have a serious talk with him because life is too be with someone that doesnt love you in return your so young, you have to experience things even though you feel that your mature.. you have a lot to learn hun... but seriously if it was me i would move on.|`|d79309d2d919bf236bb74b398593ddc1aa	You said he is in his 3rd year of college.  Maybe some time you should talk to him about what he plans after he graduates.   I realize you want to know you are his number one and not just his girl at home while he is at college.  That's why I thought if you ask him what his dreams are....what city, live alone, be with you.  Find out if the dreams include you or not.  You don't want to waste your life for someone that doesn't want to commit to you.  My sister was in the same situation.  The difference was she found out he had a girl at school that he married after he graduated.  He told my sister, that as much as he loved her...his new woman also was a college grad like him.    I wish you luck!

He knows his family more than anyone else. However, u can consider how long  the relationship has been going on prior to him taking this step. If u been together for a long time(1yr+) and its just now that u meet them, it may have been due to his reservations on how they would respond. That will indicate that he knows they will disapprove. But, if it is shortly after the relationship began, then u know that he knows his family is cool /w interracial dating and wont be racist.|`|0ebd57a25f2faa03220f370b04c2e503aa	Italians are blacks.|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	i have no idea but i hope they like you

Us girls are funny creatures, and we are hard to figure sometimes, but I bet when she received those roses, her heart just swelled with love for you. And Mike if you live to be 100, you will never understand a woman, we are to complex. Actually only another woman can know how we feel. So let me say this, I am so proud of you for sending her roses.

Like if he stays the night over, than sleep in untill you both wakeup, have breakfast together, just relaxing. Then maybe do something fun/active like go on a bike trail, or the beach, or an amusement park, or kite flying, etc. Maybe sometime in the middle of that or after go grab a snack, lunch (depending on the time). Then go watch the sunset together at maybe a lake/beach, mountain top, or a restaurant-so romanitc. Then go out for ice cream while taking a walk around, maybe downtown, or a park just catching up/talking. Then maybe see a movie at home while snuggling, or you could cook dinner and dessert together! That'd be like one of the perfect dates for me, especially if I hadn't seen my b/f in a while! Just laying in bed looking into each other's eyes before going to sleep is myfav. Whatever you do decide, make sure it's fun for both of you and you make it fun. The point is to enjoy each others company the most you can! Have fun!

The answer to this is so mind numbingly obvious it shouldn't even be asked.    The obvious choice is to get the absolute cheapest woman that you can.  She'll take you money and dump  you as soon as she is able, anyway, so why throw your cash away?  I'd also recommend going paying more for the body than you do for the face.  You can always put a bag on their face if they're too ugly to view normally, which solves the little problem handily.  On the other hand, if they're fat, they don't make bags big enough.      Clearly you're a loser, or you wouldn't be pursuing this option.  And loser's cant be choosers.  So just get what you can, and save your money for alcohol.  With enough alcohol, it won't matter what she looks like.  Oh, and ALWAYS use rubbers.    Have you considered picking up some crackwhore off the street?  They are very cheap, and you can often lead them on for months with empty promises of more crack, without actually giving them much.  The trick is just finding a clean one.

Primeramente hay hombres que nos gusta por que como dicen la cavidad es mas peque?a y por lo tanto hay mejor roce con el glande del pene habiendo asi mejor placer. Pero hay que saber hacerlo ya que obviamente a la mujer le causara dolor si no se hace con cuidado, para hacerlo mas placentero, se puede acudir a la ayuda de lubricantes naturales para una mejor penetracion sin dolor, se tiene que preparar a la dama, ir penetrando poco a poco, con mucha delicadeza, la mujer experimentara gradualmente placer ya que existen conexiones nerviosas en su ano que se estimulan al haber friccion.     Es importante la ingiene, si no se usa condon, se tiene que abstener de penetrar la vagina una vez penetrado el ano, por las posibles infecciones que pudieran conllevar, si se usa condon se recomienda usar otro para penetrar la vagina.     En lo personal no me agrada mucho tener relacion por el ano, pero si me lo pide mi amante se lo hago para satisfacerla y se como.      Para mi no hay pudor, para aquellas mujeres que tienen tabus,  recomiendo hagan algo para quitarcelos, ya que tener a sus parejas plenamente satisfechas sexualmente es garantia de fidelidad y amor se los digo como hombre y por experiencia propia.

1dbcab4a9e9431d3bcdcc1d8cf2e2e24aa	Sounds to me that he might be taking you for granted now that you're officially "going out".  Back when you were just friends, he didn't feel that he had you in the palm of his hand just yet.  So, he made a point of making time for you.    But another possibility is that he might not really want to be dating you, and he may be using work as an excuse to slip out of things.  Guys, as a general rule, do not like anything they see as confrontational as "losing" makes them feel unmanly.  As a result, they'll just stop seeing the girls they were dating instead of breaking up.  If he does not initiate contact of some kind within the next two weeks, it is safe to say you are done.|`|ddf544221ed82b9cb5997678452e5078aa	3 1/2 weeks is just getting started,  and you are too hungry for him.  try to back off and let time work.|`|3fcd14f56c55ef98504a95288581b6b1aa	hes an idiot|`|AA10678518	I think he might not want to be your boyfriend.  If it was better as friends then move on.  It should have gotten better, not worse.  If you are in a relationship you need to spend time together to relate.  Wanting that is not needy, it is how you build a relationship.  You need to sit down together and talk this out.  Good Luck!|`|AA11560224	For some guys, it is the thrill of the chase that gets them high.  Once they have what they were chasing, the thrill is not there anymore.

be8723cc793d8a39d641c9523cd621dfaa	Best thing to do is just lay it out on the table. There is no good reason to keep it hidden. Get it off your chest and see what happens. Life is short, don't miss your opportunity. That being said, consider if you guys are in the same league or not. Don't go for the hottest girl if you think you are just a normal guy.

Never even consider mentioning the word "love," to a girl until she does first -- she will respect you more for it.  If she doesn't have feelings for you besides being just a little friendly, you're doing something wrong.    Either you're too clingy, too emotional or too "nice."  It's hard to figure out which you are when you haven't said anything.|`|AA11579226	Im kinda in the same situation buddy.

I know its not easy, actually, i just got trough that, but let me tell you something, leaving a relationship is hard, but never impossible, with mjore reason if it was bad for you.   Try to practice some sports, read good books, those kind of inspiring books, eat things you like, and even if you dont feel like that, get yourself pretty; i wouldnt recommend you to get to know a person right now, because is necessary that you heal your heart and then you can start again but in a nice way.

Dicendogli anche che tu hai paura e non vorresti perderlo perci che vorresti che lui ti aspettasse ma per onest verso di lui non ritieni onesto nei suoi confronti negare a lui in questo tempo che anche lui sia e si senta libero di agire come lui ritiene giusto.  Ritengo che mostrare i propri dubbi e incertezze sia una cosa giusta, leale e onesta sia nei confronti di se stessi che di lui e ritengo che una persona che ti vuole veramente bene possa senz'altro capirti e rassicurarti su questo punto dicendoti che capisce e ti aspetta ovviamente per un tempo ragionevole che deciderai tu e lui assieme.  Se invece ti risponde che non pu accettare o non vuole significa che non considera i tuoi bisogni e allora sii te stessa e valuta. Io lo lascerei perch stare assieme significa ascoltarsi, comprendersi e capire i bisogni di chi ci sta accanto. Nello stesso modo anche tu devi ascolare le sue richieste e i suoi bisogni e se questi sono chiederti di scegliere fra te e l'altro in modo netto e preciso, adesso, la risposta pu onesta  il dirgli ." In questo momento non sono nelle condizioni di farlo, decidi tu !"  Puoi avere due risposte :" OK ti aspetto " oppure " Ci lasciamo".  Devi accettare le conseguenze dell'una o dell'altra risposta.

I'd actually put it at 90%, but I've been burnt on the telephone, after 'meeting' someone online.    About 3/4ths of Internet 'dating' types are very low on social-skills, or natural charm, or personal hygeine, or basic decency, or morality, or some other vitally important element of meeting and connecting with people face-to-face, (mostly they're just hideously insecure, and afraid of rejection, but there is a fair old proportion of psychos and just plain ghouls out there) -- in short, you would never date them if you met them in person.  (THINKING POINT: Why do you use Internet chat to meet people?)    A healthy working assumption is that anyone you meet online is making him/herself SEEM sane, safe, healthy, and attractive.  DO NOT get caught in anyone's nets.  There are also a lot of very predatory people (male and female) who stalk the chat rooms, looking for people to toy with, and when they get bored, they move on.    Looks as though you met one of those.    Burn your bridges.  Unsubscribe from those chat rooms and online dating services, and, not to be harsh, because you probably are more insecure than anything else, get a life, sister!|`|3e24601c97eebfd69ccf92276c83c302aa	Wow such a hard life, this guy is not worth your whiny crying over for goodness sake, grow up little girl. this was on line stuff stupid it is not for real. got over it. you spend way to much on the computer.|`|AA12065549	"chat married?"

La cientfica responde a la necesidad de preservacin de la especie. La mujer le muestra al macho sus encantos para atraerlo buscando ser la escogida por el mejor como la mejor y as, derrotar a la competencia. Entonces, si tuviera un bello plumaje lo desplegara abiertamente para que stos, se fijaran en ella.  Y viene la pasional. La mujer no tiene plumaje pero si encuentra la forma de desplegar sus encantos. Su ropa (puede ser bastante sensual), sus senos (los exhibe a travs de su escote),  sus piernas; si son atractivas, mediante una mini bien sugestiva y sus nalguitas (con unos jeans apretados). Esto, acompa?ado de un caminado bien sugestivo, pues lleva a mirarlas de primero en esas partes. Despus se mira la cara para saber si responde a tanta finura.   Lo ltimo es, lo correspondiente al contacto personal. Y ustedes a veces se preguntan. Pero que tiene esa fea para haber conquistado a ese hombre tan bello. Pues las otras sutilezas que no tienen las otras hembras del reino animal. Su gracia interna, su "algo" de hacer sentir al hombre especial, etc.  En un grado parecido, ocurre al contrario. Si ustedes ven un hombre "bello", posiblemente le mirarn su bulto y sus nalgas y estos, exhibiran sus atributos, cara, resto del cuerpo, para atraer a las hembras. Pero, al igual que las mujeres, prima el resto de lo que se lleva escondido. Eso que un bonito(a) levante pareja del sexo opuesto no tiene gracia. La gracia es que un feito(a) levanten pareja.

3200d5d677a2d8a06619e07a4d88cfdeaa	Sure. I can tell you my firsthand experience. By the way the term means different things to different people. But, just one aspect is the way English is being spread all over the world. I think this is an acute aspect of globalization. Because language comes with its own set of traditions and ways of thinking, it profoundly affects people. There are good and bad things about it, though. On the one hand, people seem more able to commercially exploit the rising tendency to emulate the American and Western societies all over the world. Skilled labour are now able to move across different societies and make a better living than before. On the other hand, people are losing the very essence of their individuality. The Japanese and the Chinese are becoming more "Americanized" which I find appalling. Culture seems to move more from the West to the East, and from the North to the South. I am afraid that given the time, we'll end up with one huge United States of The World.|`|496c61ce266005d5e81886e6e909944daa	I feel that here in Australia we have sold out all our companies to overseas interests. It has had a devastating effect on the rural and manufacturing sectors and crime has increased with unfettered immigration. It's success depends on constant "growth" and it feeds multinational companies at the expense of the population. We are being robbed and are told the only solution is to breed ever more consumers. You can buy cheaper goods, but have less real wealth as land electricity and water are all corporatised. When the Chinese ,Indian and muslim cultures have achieved our level of greed all humanity can all stand dying in ridiculous running shoes, on a planet stripped bare with our air conditioners, 6 mobile phones, cheap electric drills and dvd recorders.

Si es hijo de ambos no tiene porque molestarle, tu tambien estas buscando lo mejor para tu hijo.

Lo ideal es conversar con tu pareja como dividir los gastos. No es justo que todo recaiga sobre uno solo. Ni sobre el que gana ms. Un hogar tiene muchos gastos, y yo recomiendo tener una contabilidad del hogar. Por ejemplo los gastos fijos y bsicos (luz, agua, telfono, alquiler -sino es casa propia-) que son mensuales, estn los gastos diarios (comida, pasajes, combustible -si tens mvil-), gastos de aseo personal (jabones, shamp, etc) En fin, lo que yo hacia era compartir gastos fijos 50 y 50. Los gastos darios y de aseo personal eran digamos que por "turno" un mes yo, otro mes mi novio, o quin contaba con dinero en ese momento.  Hay que buscar el equilibrio. O por ejemplo, que uno de los dos se haga cargo de x gastos y el otro de otros. No es fcil.. PERO SE PUEDE!!! Lo que uno busca es la estabilidad no? y con un buen dilogo, con AMOR y paciencia todo es posible. Suerte!

San Agustn identific al amor con Dios, es decir personific la idea del amor, ponindoles filosofa y belleza potica a los textos bblicos. "Tarde te am, belleza tan antigua y tan nueva, tarde te am. Y he aqu que t estabas dentro y yo fuera... Una vez abierto el camino, los msticos siguieron tras la contemplacin y goce directo del Amor, no en sus sombras, sino en su esencia, sin la mediacin siquiera de los sentidos. Es sta la forma ms platnica del amor. No sera nada extra?o que fuese la mstica iniciada por san Agustn, que durante siglos mantuvo forma tan slo teolgica.

Por cada regla que alguien pueda mencionar (esas que empiezan con "Todas las mujeres...") existen excepciones.    Ahora si, sin intencin de apachurrarte los nimos, la mayora de las veces cuando alguien se dice "confundido" lo que significa es que ya no te quieren.    Esto podra ser por muchas razones y pudiera ser que tu tuvieras parte de la culpa.    ?Cmo hacerle? Mi opinin personal es comenzar por aprender a quererse uno mismo, aprender que cosas nos gustan en una relacin y que cosas no aguantamos. Finalmente, dejarse de juegos, que si ponerse difcil, que si ser muy encantador, etc. Yo digo que hay que ser como nos surja de manera natural y si a la chava no le gusta pues ni modo.    De otra forma, al final del da resulta que la conquistas siendo una persona que no eres realmente t y eso no va a funcionar.    Mi consejo con esta mujer particular: Hblale claro acerca de como te sientes. Si ya lo hiciste pues pedirle que tambin te diga claramente las cosas. Si despus de ambas cosas te dice que deveras est confundida pues tal vez darle un poco de tiempo y ver que pasa.    nimo y te pongas triste que hay que pasar por cosas de stas antes de encontrar una buena relacin.|`|995086217014649d66f3b2615b0f8aacaa	WELL WELL ...

Quizas ella no esta convencida de querer compromisos  pero cuando ve que te alejas  estoy completamente segura que le da miedo perderte y eso significa que te Quiere pero quizas no esta preparada para tomar la decicion, los tiempos para cada mujer son distintos por eso es bueno que respetes sus espacios y que le des la  seguridad  suficiente para que ella pueda demostrarte lo que siente por vos. Creo que le debes interesar pero de eso vos solo te podes dar cuenta; te digo esto porque yo actue exactamente igual con una persona y reaccione del mismo modo, esta bueno que te alejes por un tiempo pero sin exagerar ya que si haces eso ella puede pensar que no le importas nada y si es media insegura es probable que no se acerque mas por miedo a ser rechazada.

AA10833465	the person you are describing is positively NOT your best fried!!!!    one doesn't define their best friends by whoever decides to proclaim that THEY are YOUR best friend!    you define a BEST friend by they're actions and the way YOU feel about them and hanging out, sharing ideas and conversation, being a great companion and partner some of the most important quality's a person must poses before they can be any ones best friend.    that's my opinion and i think you need to ask yourself "who is my best friend?" figure who it truly is and build on that friendship always and in time you will truly have a best friend you can be Proud to proclaim as your BEST FRIEND. Tom AL USA|`|AA11778516	well if he's not talking to you now...dont worry if he doesn't in the future, tell him straight, it wont matter what he thinks...he's not your best friend he's just saying that to butter you up...he does not even contact you or hang out with you so he's definitely no friend...ignore him and find someone who's not fake|`|7da973d99f7e5e2284bd65d6ca02ce42aa	he is not your friend friends don't treat each other like that find another person to hang out with trust me been there done that|`|7136ffb75b8525969d3f4a0148d5645caa	If he thinks of you the same way, he will appreciate your honesty, if not isnt worth having as a freind.|`|aa679c6ce84a2ca860911237a432449aaa	It is always a good idea to be careful about the people you become friends with, because you never know what they are really like. Whatever it is about your best friend it can't be good especially since he is not talking to you and does not want to hang out with you. The best thing you need to do is to go up to your friend when you are free to talk to him and let him know that you appreciate him wanting to be friends but you see that he has other interests and that you would like you and him could no longer be friend because you don't feel you are getting the full benefit. If he gets angry it because you told him the truth and not what he wants to hear if he is the type. You do what you have to do and if he says fine and walks away then you know you did your part and that there is nothing else you can do.|`|74e23bdc063e47b12bb302a851a34603aa	u got to tell him sooner or later u don't really have much of a choise here =/|`|51863d912939644daeb9911de16fe99eaa	i think you should really talk to him     ======================================...

Hard telling, just sound strange.
85e48f0983047fc3709d314d8753bd56aa	She was in a serious relationship all this time !    So there was no reason for me to ask her out for a serious date.   She ended a serious relationship a few months back.    I am not sure if she did it for me or for her own other reasons. At least she has not told me so.   So I am uncertain about her behaviour. Could she do the same to me, later on ?     As a man, I would prefer that she should take me in about the whole matter and improve my confidence in her.    IN ANY CASE, SHE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT BEING WITH HER FOR TWO LONG YEARS, KNOWING THAT SHE WAS IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP, MEANS THAT I AM SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN HER !!|`|AA11778516	i agree with CRACK.....seems like a pretty reasonable answer to me....|`|cde58727159fd5660d7cd2c9f7e1632aaa	he is shy and most likely a virgin, you might wanna work on that with him|`|6f3f57540dd14c18fc9455e76b075c88aa	you dont know how to ask her out cuz you really like and respect her and is afraid of rejection|`|cdb25cb15269b2d403a3c5bcdb3360b5aa	Friends can kiss!

Like don't throw yourself at him, he could take advantage, whether you'd believe that or not. But, get to know him more. Go out on dates with him if he wants. Tell him at a point that you like him. Make sure he kisses you and not take a step that you don't want him too. You'll experience many good and some bad times with guys, or you might get lucky and find mr. right like that.

That is the technique my mom always uses. But.....if you are just crushing on this guy, and if there isn't any actual relationship, try baby steps.

Tienes que entender que su hija es importante para el, y que por tanto tiene que mantenerse en buena comunicacion con su ex, claro que eso no significa que debas estar atenta, pero si creo que algo muy importante es que deben tenerse confianza, se segura de ti, por que lo que lei, tu temor es de ella, cosa que no esta bien, tu eres la unica que debes saber y estar segura de lo que el siente por ti.    A los hombres no les gusta que les demuestren tanta inseguridad, demuestrale cuanto le interesas, ganate su amor, creo que sera lo mejor, pero recuerda la unica arma  (de doble filo que tenemos) es la Confianza, ya que esa relacion entre ellos desgraciadamente tiene que existir.      Suerte|`|aedb7b0c37cbe22ee8a8bfdf145b9df6aa	con el tiempo veras si en verdad te quiere es logico que de princio te hablaba mucho de ella por que entre comillas se supone que era su gran amor ya que tienen un hijo de por medio solo espera un tiempo y veras si su amor es verdadera con el tiempo se van dando muchas cosas y es ahi donde tu tienes que poner tope a tu relacion cuando ya te ayas dado cuanta de su amor .............   yo creo que por algo esta contigo es logico que si te busco es por que te quiere  y si te llevo donde su familia es obvio que te requiere por que los hombres son muy pocas veces cuando llevan a  su pareja a la casa el te llevo por que se sentia seguro contigo el piensa que van a durar mucho ese es un gran detalle que deberias pensar que te llevo donde su familia  ....... pero igual espera un tiempo por que donde fuego hubo cenisas quedan como dice el dicho que si tu pareja y la ex de el  todavia alomejor pueden sentir algo .. pero no lo creo asi por que si todavia estubi eran enamorados ya habrian vuelto    bueno amiga te deceo lo mejor suerte|`|9c85de643cd278aacceadd47b76a8e83aa	Cuando una persona se une a otra que tiene un pasado es imposible que lo haga a un lado, si tu lo amas y confias en l deberas primero aceptarlo tal y como lo conociste( l y su otra familia), ser dificil para ti por que el estar viendo a su hija y por ende a su ex, asi que debers primero sentarte a meditar que tanto lo amas y si soportars y aceptaras el pasado de l, si despues de que lo pensaste decides permanecer a su lado dejale ver que le tienes confianza y demuestraselo, pero una vez ms te digo que no ser facil pero de ti depender en gran parte el exito de tu noviazgo.|`|c109750147ce0a3d7ee0dba86e8f9447aa	Aqui veo algo que no esta bien, primeramente veo inseguridad de tu parte, y eso te puedes hacer da?o mental y fisicamente, ya que te produce celo y enojo, dudas,desconfianzas y malos pensamientos. En segundo lugar veo que no se conocen muy bien y por tal razon, vienen la inseguridad, y las dudas, y no sabes cuando te estan hablando la verdad y cuando te estan mintiendo y esto te prende por no decir te llena de coraje y de iras. Entecer lugar quiero que entiendas de que hay una hija de pormedio y una hija es una hija; por eso dice el dicho: Donde ha havido fuego ceniza quedan, Por lo tanto siempre tendras que ver a tu novio con la madre de su hija, y si ella todavia lo quiere y lo ama, tu puedes estar segura que algo pueda suceder aunque tu novio te digas por ahora que ya l nada tiene que ver con ella que solamente es la hija,  y quien sabes si es cierto,y l te estas hablando con la verdad? .  Pero te haz preguntado porque se dejaron, porque no estan juntos, cual fue la causa de su separacion, Sabe la madre de su hija de que l esta saliendo contigo? de que son novios, que tiempo hacen que ustedes salen como novio y que tiempo hace que el termino con la madre de su hija?  Que confianza tu tienes con tu novio, hasta donde tu le conoces, si tu desea saber la verdad porque no te allega a la madre de su hija o si no te atreves a ir, puedes enviar algun familiar y asesorarte de la verdad,  investigue toda la verdad, y sabras la causa de su rotura o si todavia estan juntos. hay un dicho que dice: El pazmo con tieimpo tiene remedio. Y mas vale precaver que remediar, Por lo tanto te aconsejo de dialogue firmemente con tu novio, sean sincero, nunca le oculte nada, siempre hablale con la verdad, no lo cele, procura tener tu mente clara, sin ninguna malicia o sin ninguna duda o sospecha, nunca te acuestes con l o mejor dicho no tengas relaciones de intimidad, hasta que no te cases para que no te pase lo mismo que a la madre de su hijo, procurar conocer bien a tu novio y cuales son sus intenciones para contigo, No te dejes llevar de las apariencias, ni de los detalles que l te puedas brindar, sino  procura de estar segura en todo. Y si enverdad l tiene buenas intenciones para contigo te respetara, te aceptara tal como tu eres, no se aprovechara de tu amor hacia l, ni tampoco jugara con tus sentimientos. Pero recuerdas que no puedes prohivirle que vea a su hijo, ni que corte con su la madre de su hijo, pues el tiene que mantenerlo y soportarlo como padre del menor que es, y por esto el tiene que ver y hablar con la madre de su hijo, por eso te aconsejo que este segura de ti misma, que procure saber todas la verdad, y que indague con esta mujer pero como amiga sin reclamo ni pleito porque tu no tienes derecho de reclamo ni de pelear por un hombre ni por nadie, manten tu dignidad y tu prudencia siempre firme. Tampoco le recrimine a tu novio ni sea dura ni injusta con l, por  tus celos y caprichos, asegurate de que cuando actue lo esta haciendo concientemente con toda justicia.

No seas en ningn momento limosnera de amor.    Puede ser que estes buscando a travs de tus relaciones algo que no se encuentra en ellas y los dems se dan cuenta de ello, y se aprovechan.

Eso si realmente te importa seguir la relacion.|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	OK, dime en que te puedo ayudar????????|`|12818bea70131ce407f0f03925074c88aa	Bueno dale tiempo aveces presionar no es bueno,deja que ella olvide ese momento acuerdese que las mujeres son diferentes a uno una palabra mal dicha causa mucho dolor y se extiende demasiado el tiempo antes que ella muestre se?ales de cambio de actitud,recuerdale esos momentos tan intimos queson solo de ustedes vivanlos|`|1227e96214b2e42ff9305acbe1f766ecaa	pideselo personalmente si la amas, si no entiendes te kiero decir que la familia es mas importante que todo el dinero del mundo el cual no compra la felicidad|`|ea1a6a058bdd8206fcfb8f5aef18d3d6aa	Pues depende mucho de lo que le hayas dicho, pero trata de recordarle que la amas mucho, que para ti es muy difcil lo que has pasado para llegar a EU y que si te fuiste fue para que estuvieran mejor. Dile (pero s sincero) cunto la has extra?ado t tambin y las ganas que tienes de estar con ella.  Y bueno, lo ideal sera que pudieras volver o llevarla contigo. Recuerda que para nosotras es muy importante lo emocional, aunque para ustedes los hombres sea importante traer el sustento a sus hogares. A veces parece que uno no valora lo que el otro siente, pero traten de intercambiar papeles y se entendern mejor.  ?Suerte!|`|7765fcada9361b45b83ed38522930b01aa	Bueno si no te deja hablarle, escribele y dile que es lo que pinzas y cuales son las razones para seguir trabajando aca, y sobre todo hasle saber que aun la amas, y que tambien tu la necesitas, pero dale una fecha en la cual tu creas conveniente para poder regrezar., y recuerda que el dinero no lo es todo..Tambien necesitamos de nuestra pareja, nosolo para pelear sino para poder compartir buenos y malos momentos, no se si tengan ni?os pero si existen aun mas haslo por ellos, platica con tu esposa.

It was the most romantic thing I had ever seen.    A couple days before her birthday she got a package from her man.  It had some plastic flowers in it, a small box of candy, a few pics of him and one card for every year she was alive.  She was turning 24 so his plan worked perfect.  She wasn't allowed to open any of the cards until her birthday.  The cards where numbered and she was only allowed one an hour starting at midnight and going until midnight - a 24hr period.     Some of the cards were the standard bday cards and some where I love you cards and some where just blank cards, but he had written a special memory, poem or saying on each card.  It was very touching and to this day she still has every single card.  If you do it you might  be able to put stickers of the anime people in one or a burned CD in another.  Its up to you want you want in the cards.    The other real cool present he got her was from the pajamas gram website.  He had a pair of pajamas sent to her so that she could go to sleep thinking of him every night.  Here is the website.    http://www.pajamagram.com    I know it all sounds cheesy, but it was super sweet and I have yet to see anything that topped it.  Oh and yes she did go to sleep so some of the cards got mass opened, but it didnt really matter its the thought that made the deal.    Good luck.. you are so sweet!|`|10ead7b8e7d76a307156e2aed3f8b98aaa	Send a bunch of flowers through inter flora

Sometimes our instincts tell us something is amiss and its usually right, but some of us just need to ride the wave till we acknowledge its making us ill and we wanna get off. Either that or someone gives you confirmation that whats going on isnt right and your not making something out of nothing as some manipulative liars would have others believe.  Tell your friend to start protecting her heart just in case the situation doesnt amend itself.

0abbe5340984d442c7e1ad771fd0ae63aa	Ti rispondo con un episodio della mia vita, alcuni anni fa ho conosciuto una ragazza sposata,  (di questo mi dispiace) tra di noi  nato subito un attrazione, quel giorno non ci fu altro che un bacio.  Dopo alcuni giorni, la sorella che conoscevo meglio mi chiam e mi disse che la . Era scappata e voleva venire via con me.  Penso che fu la settimana damore pi intensa della mia vita, entrambi pur non parlandone sapevamo che tutto sarebbe finito.  Un ricordo che mai dimenticher fu lultima mattina damore.  Lei veniva di continuo, sembrava come impazzita, la guardai in viso e mi accorsi che mentre facevamo lamore essa piangeva, non lo dimenticher mai, ma nello stesso tempo compresi come era giusto che lamore per i figli aveva vinto.  Che dire un episodio di vita e di amore che non poteva realizzarsi ma nello stesso tempo, fa capire che si pu amare intensamente senza pensare ad un futuro un attimo damore vero e intenso.|`|b9044b86534fa38c5d0882363ee27fe0aa	ma una via di mezzo no?|`|4483dfeafb25e189868f6f71ef78af37aa	io preferisco una botta e via, chi s' visto s' visto|`|80d7e3447149545b3012418c4a8ea1f5aa	un paio di anni fa ti avrei detto un' amore passionale ma che finisce poco dopo,adesso sto con una persona da 4 anni,ci sono i litigi e ci annoiamo(qualche volta),ma sono sicura di avere una persona che mi vuole bene e che quando ho problemi o sto male lui c'    TI RINGRAZIO AZZ............|`|b451d8554c1a0c9e960c005d89fcf21baa	direi la prima xke nn mi piacerebbe vivere una storia triste e monotona anke se questa mi porterebbe al matrimonio.Ma mi piacerebbe  una bella storia anke se queta nn mi portera al matrimonio ma almeno potro dire di avere amato veramente ed essere stato amato!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4d690b1cd233c90b3b25e389dd073388aa	diciamo una via di mezzo. se nn  possibile facciamo il primo ciao!!!!|`|52fc372c5cdd23d4a214132437dc5befaa	nn pensare..ama....se poi questo amore sar passionale o monotono fregatene...vivi solo questa vita....sar quel che sar...l'importante  che nella tua vita ci sia un po' d'amore che  il carburante dell'esistenza..altrimenti pin piano ci appassiremo come fiori..spero di averti aiutato...ciao..|`|45b3f6f54581d1b8bd81ebcf62394687aa	guarda quello cn passione...cm dici te nn vorrei xk se ami cm pazzo cn passione ....alla fine se vi lasciate soffri cm un cane...io ho vissuto quindi nn vorrei viverla una seconda volta,fa trp male alla fine.....preferirei un amore stabile anke cn matrimonio e cm dici te nn puo essere  triste o monotono xke sei te ke cambi la tua giornata o le tue fantasie ect,,,,,,meglio 1 amore ke duri x sempre ke 10 e tutti finscono male e soffri cmq...  ciao grazie x la domanda .....      senti ma tu nn hai detto ke se hai un amore cn passione e quel altro senza quale vorremmo scegliere.... normale e logico ke se ci sta tutte e due insieme sceglierei quello cn passione...pero se ti sposi gia ami la persona nn e ke sposi x essere triste o monotono ma ke dici nn ho capito niente  una dom molto difficile|`|a93c7fa50602662c6ff98f066e795fa8aa	per prima cosa complimenti per la domanda ,che prende spunto da una frase che racchiude una grande verit.detto questo io sono sicuramente dell idea di lasciarsi andare ad inseguire un amore  pazzo che pu portarti alla rovina ma ti da quella passione che per me  linfa vitale . anche vero per che nel mio carattere c  una buona dose di autolesionismo perci non so quanto logica sia la mia scelta|`|70d707e0a34fb751c1276ebe96fad7a3aa	Sicuramente sono per l'amore folle e passionale..quello che non ti fa capire pi niente..che ti fa ridere senza motivo..e che ti uccide in un attimo..piuttosto che un amore monotono e dato solo dall'abitudine.

Poi il tempo cambia le cose, si sa che la passione affievolisce e subentra l'abitudine, ma subentrano anche altri valori fondamentali,come la complicit, la profonda conoscenza, l'impossibilit di vivere la vita senza l'altro anche se le sere sembrano tutte uguali...ma sinceramente a 60 anni non so se vorrei la passione che vorrei ora da mio marito, credo che sia un percorso naturale.

Direi che l'amore stabile  pi facile da gestire ed  pi semplice gettare le basi per una convivenza serena.    L'amore passionale, invece,  un campo conservativo: per quanto ti sforzi di arrivare in alto, rischi di avere una ricaduta e di  restare a zero nel bilancio della "felicit effettiva". E poi  difficile da gestire e pieno di complicazioni.|`|d96284e1cf00309a287cf2bc7ec49f66aa	ma guarda che la vita  anche monotonia, a volte  anche noia.... e il bello di questo  avere al fianco qualcuno con cui dividere anche queste. troppo comodo vivere in adrenalina, e soprattutto pi facile, mai un attimo di tregua sempre e solo passione......ECCHECAVOLO ma cos non  vita!

48e93c3860ef30becbdb079367708c77aa	It's harder to find quality when you're looking.  Don't look, just live your life.  If someone great comes along before you leave, cross that bridge when you come to it.  If nobody has come along in 2 years, they probably won't in the next 6 months.    IF you meet someone, you can keep it at a mellow level because you'll probably want to date German girls while you're there.|`|26fbd68651e7157e23c05ff2a8aba48faa	*** u don't look for love...it'll find u when it/u are ready for it.  just relax.|`|AA10455980	wait! i'm lonely too but i'll have too wait till it happens|`|21ab434ad9db075b8f46fdc9a9bf4d8aaa	I think it's stupid to think about having to wait for love. If you meet someone within the seven months you're still here for... then take it. Just live your life. You may end up getting to know each other, dating and breaking up before March even rolls around. Or, you may meet someone that can come with you to Europe.   Also, don't count on falling in love in Germany. If it doesn't happen you will be dissapointed that you psyched yourself up so much for it, and it didn't happen.|`|0bd8c955129b8a71d3ee0c4d921b3f79aa	it ok 2 want for love if u seek it i might not come let love find u|`|5bc215b919663176646380f1c1087324aa	be single and love it  you will find someone when the right time comes, just dont push it  if you do, then you wont find the right person!  keep beiing yourself  and keep the yo-yo up!|`|9558ad166648fb8e5ac65898c2e342c3aa	I think that you should wait and not look at all. I'm 26 and I've never been in a dating relationship. I don't like single life on some days but when I think of the benefits of being single I absolutely love it. Just go forward in your life and when the time is right, it'll happen. Don't look and love will find you. Don't rush and it'll last forever.|`|AA11060850	You are probaly like me, just knowing if you found a really cool girl it would lead to love, and maybe even overnight. A very valid fear.  My advice: It is best not to look for love. I looked for a long time and the very month I really truly gave up, I found that love I had been looking for.   But you cannot lie to your heart, so you cannot psyche it out.   Just go with the flow, and even if you have to break it off with someone, if it was true love, they will find you again.  Good luck
XuC9fhAPaa	No, no pasa nada, es lo mismo que tragar saliva. Tanto el semen como la saliva tienen una textura y composicin muy parecida.

La forma en que me miran sus ojos que no tienen nada de particular pero que para mi son maravillosos.   La forma en que pronuncia mi nombre que hace que se me enchine el cuerpo y lo que siento cuando yo pronuncio el suyo.Cuando sientas que tu ultimo pensamiento al dormir sea para ella y el primer pensamiento al despertar sea para ella entonces ten por seguro que habras encontrado tu ALMA GEMELA.

632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	Well, you REALLY put him off by rejecting him.  Not to say that you were wrong for rejecting him, but he's obviously got some ideas about dating that he should have outgrown from high school, and you don't see clearly enough to realize that.  Adults go on dates, they don't jump right into a relationship.    If you really like him and weren't rude to him in rejecting him, I think this should be simple enough to fix.  You need to just tell him that you feel like you barely knew him and that's why you didn't want to be his girlfriend.  Tell him you would like to get to know him a bit before you make that jump.  Surely he will cheer up, you know?  Good luck!|`|265599eb6b09216771b00ec5b3f92bfeaa	I would wonder if he has a girlfriend or wife already, since he seems unavailable when you invite him on dates.  Also, I don't know his age, but he has to be at least 18 to be on match, but I think asking you to be his girlfriend on a first date if weird.  Plus, he ignores you when you are truthful, which makes him seem like a jerk who you wouldn't want to get involved with.  There are lots of nice guys on match (I met mine there), so keep looking and don't settle for someone who seems so sketchy.|`|442d8d2dc1046692cb8af73f7d712a73aa	sounds weird. move on|`|0f5ba528addf76bc731f7bde39b77850aa	Its awkward when you get rejected by someone you like and then still hanging out with them.. you ned to talk to him..|`|232fd351e445e63499d582b7c585e4faaa	wow...  match.com?  does that stuff really work?  have you hooked up w/ a guy (bedroom relations) from match.com?|`|b9f469501e8c2de326b20c8bc2b143faaa	In my opinion, there are simply too many players on that site. It could be a million different rasons as to why he is acting so strange. Basically though he does not seem to possess the type of relationship skills to maintain a healthy relationship. I would view that as a major red flag and sign. I fear that if you did ever get involved in a relationship with him, it would include a lot of game playing. My advice: head the warning and move on.|`|ec8065ecce5e363795e65d8c255448f2aa	If he isn't initiating anything...he does not like you that much.    You need to move on and quit acting needy.  This guy is a big fat zero!    You kind of answered your own question when you said he didn't seem into it.  He isn't.

A todas las mujeres les encanta el sexo oral y cualquiera puede hacerlo de una buena manera.    El contacto de la lengua con las paredes vaginales o el cltoris, hace que la mujer llegue fcilmente al orgasmo. Claro que un poco de mtodo es bueno, porque si lo haces muy duro o sin cuidado, va a dolerles.    En fin, tal vez tengas un buen mtodo y se te lo dijeron, por algo debe ser.

White guys normally seem to love big breast. Black guys love nice butts. Some guys like pretty faces, but most guys would chose a great body over a alsome face if we had to chose. Yes we do pick mostly physical stuff. However if you want to really woo a guy get into stuff he likes. Video games, sports, whatever it is. Girls that do this is rare and stand out. You will have less competition from other girls if you do this. Still you must be physically attractive to him. Most guys if they like you, will tell you. It's only those shy types that won't, I used to be like that and in some ways still am. Meaning I won't try to talk to a girl that is with a bunch of girls. In that case it helps to be a aggressive women, which some men like my self adore. My fiance fits the type I said above and she stands out to me.

Todas las parejas pasan por crisis y si se superan es cuando se sabe si una relacin merece la pena. De todas maneras debes tener en cuenta que una relacin a distancia es mucho ms difcil (aunque no imposible) porque una pareja se afianza en el da a da.   Si cuando hables con l ves que es muy difcil solucionar el problema no intentes mantener la relacin a la fuerza, porque as s que la condenars al fracaso. Si l ve que no lo presionas y decids tomaros un tiempo para reflexionar sobre lo vuestro creo que puede tener ms posibilidades de xito que aferrndote a algo que no tiene solucin.  En el caso de que tu pareja y t decidais seguir caminos diferentes, no se acaba el mundo, aunque al principio te creas que es as, siempre se acaba superando.  Adems, es posible, si lo piensas framente, que sea ms conveniente para ti,encontrar a una persona que viva cerca de ti y con la que puedas construir una relacin con una base ms slida.

Si el te ama, resolver su conflicto y confusin y pondr en balanza tu amor,  pero valorizate, habla directo, no medias palabras, dile lo que sientes y lo que esperas,  el amor no es de uno solo sino de dos, esto es compartir a el mismo nivel.  Dale tiempo pero a la vez le dejas claro tu punto de vista de dicha situacin, amiga, la distancia es tu enemiga, la soledad de una persona hace que busque compa?a, amistad o quien sabe, pero para que pueda el entender lo que tu sientes, dile que el hara si la situacin fuera a la inversa, si en vez de el estar pasando por eso fueras tu, que haria? ponlo en esa disyuntiva, que vea lo que se siente.

Pero nunca olvides que las platicas entre parejas son las mejores para solucionar cualqueir duda o enojo que tengas, no con esto te queiro decir que sienpre vas a estar discutiendo.

Es muy dficil adaptarse a otro. Es un momento de muchos cambios y muchas tensiones. Lo importante es tomarlo con calma y no definir una pareja por estos momentos tan complicados. Con el tiempo todo pasa y las cosa se solucionan, en algunos casos y en otros, quiz sean incompatibles.  Lo mejor es que la pareja resuelva sus problemas sinq ue la familia de ninguno de los dos se metan, ya es dificil entre dos para que que encima todos opinen y traigan problemas.

I've since read that it's fairly common and is the brain recalling the birth process.|`|651e4d138620386f55d76fb0bbecadfeaa	No sorry, all my childhood memories are very vague before the age of 5.|`|2a56cfe8f16f0b718efa89fb311ef870aa	nope. sadly i cannot recall any memories or what had happened when i came out of my mother's womb 25 years ago. well, make it 26 as we're entering 2007 and as i'll be turning 26 on february
25428eabe3e02993e80e0f1affd5d59faa	Well, unfortunately, your daughter's father is still a child himself and can't see far enough in front of his own face to see how his actions are affecting his daughter.  If I were you, I would just explain everything as honestly as I could to my daughter, and not go to any extremes to set up visits.  If they want to make all the effort, then let them, but if you have sole custody, you can also make sure all those visits happen at your house, where you are there to make your daughter feel comfortable.  When your daughter becomes an adult, she'll have her own things she wants to say to her father and his family, and at that time, they'll learn what a mistake has been made, but before then, it's nearly impossible to do anything about it.  Good luck!|`|030dd82cb167c736f497afbef6fd62d2aa	a really sad situation.  i think you already know your answer, but i say that he's her father biologically, but as a FATHER he's nothing! he'd be phased out quickly so as not to disrupt my daughter's life and further.  she doesn't need a person in her life that can't provide more than empty promises and makes her miserable.  as her mom, you have to be her parent first which means doing what's best for your child.  you have to be her buffer/shield, protection, comforter, confidant and all of the other things that go with parenting.  its unfortunate that you're the only parent and famly member that has your daughter's interest at the forefront of your mind and on your heart.  if we could control the things that others do to us, and our loved ones, we'd be in a helluva position but we aren't.  as her mother, you'll ride the emotional rollercoaster with her becuse you don't like seeing your daughter hurt by the family that doesn't find it necessary to be part of her life.      you've got the best part....you're experiencing everything with your daughter.  you won't miss out on all of the milestones..the first kiss, boyfriend, a really great thing that happened at school today...and all of those kinds of things that make parenthood so wonderful.  you'll have those times to share with each other and to remember.  please DON'T WASTE your tim and your daughter's worrying about those that provide little more than lip service.  you'll do yourself more harm, it may be a blessing in disguise that the other family doesn't come around, and they'll be looking foolish when they want to get to know her and the choice she chooses is not to.  they're missing out ...you're not.  be there for your daughter...time passes too quickly to worry about what we cannot control.  childhood passes to quickly....cherish it with your daughter.|`|AA11778516	you're right...screaming and shouting solves nothing, ask your daughter how she feels about this situation, if she is not happy about it then tell the creep to take a walk....he's messing with her and i think that's cruel....she obviously loves him, but he is giving her false hopes....after reading your other post about the letter your daughter wrote to Santa, i would say, send them ALL a copy and let them knoww how much she's hurting, then add that if they want to see her, the least they could do is pick up the phone, it does not take much to do that, your daughter does not kno if she's coming or going, she is human and some people seem to think that kids don't care and at the age of 11 don't have feelings, how wrong could they be, your daughter is an example, they should consider her feelings and stop mucking her about|`|3c6730336a7a2a2a49d6e81e90aefad4aa	what i would do is try to talk to your ex and family and explain the effect it is having keep on trying. if this doesnt work my advice would be do not let them see your daughter, until they can be trusted it is not doing any good for her or you.    Good Luck|`|1c1810dfb1b29b649801783d0a255bd0aa	You could tell them that if they want contact they need to be reliable and consistent as it upsets your daughter when they don't bother to contact her. Access/visitation is a childs right to see the absent parent, not the other way round. If they can't all put her interests first maybe it's best to explain to your daughter that it's not anything about her but they are inconsistent people.|`|5a392d74d6c6b584546688fbec7ea52aaa	i don't think i would push the issue to the other side of the family. i would let my child know she is still loved but there are people out there who just don't understand children yet and maybe they will ONE DAY. let her make the call. don't let them run your household. them doing your daughter like that hurts you too as well as her. leave them alone until she's ready.|`|5d21191191157ff05277e02fae7359a6aa	O that is awful, my daughters father left me when I was five month pregnant with my daughter and i always wonder if he will appear again.  I feel so bad for you and your daughter I understand she probaly desperatly wants to have her father in her life and i wam sure u want that for her 2 but she is not building a stable relationship with him dueto his constant disappearing acts.  I think harsh as it maybe she is better of with no contact with him or the family at all!!!|`|65549cbd3a6420fefed4b9ae61d7a154aa	Its their loss ,they have missed out on your daughters life,even though your daughter is feeling lonely at the minute,when she gets older she will have a better understanding of people and realise that there are some shallow selfish people out there.It sounds like you have done all you can to keep communication channels open and they just breeze in and out as they please. Your daughter will still grow up balanced because of the example your showing her.It makes me really angry(have something similar in my family)but i know its their loss in the long run and they will regret it in years to come.take care|`|80a7baaaa95c34df3b476f25d14bbb10aa	You need to be there for your daughter...stop and think...take a breath and ask yourself how will your little girl benefit from distant and unreliable relatives?....they would only cause hurt in the long run and this isn't fair on your girl.....surround her with the family that care...your relatives and friends and make things nice for her...this way she can see that it is not her but rather them with the problem......|`|9106165ae84d53ee275469e1a89fc7e0aa	What you and your daughter are going thur is difficult. But your daughter and yourself are learning a valuable lesson and that is love is more than words its our actions.Tell your daughter that. That way when your daughter becomes a teen and some guy starts telling her he loves her she'll know what real love consist of. What about your side of the family? Have her bond with them. I know you what to curse everybody out involved but whatever you do don't. Teach your daughter how to handle conflict appropriately. When those family members  start talking about how they want to see her and how they'll be picking her up next week, confront then on it but in an appropriate manner. Don't go ghetto, that's what they want so you'll end up looking like the crazy woman. Sit them down and calming explain what they are doing and how its been affecting your daughter (allow your daughter to be present). Its not about you having the power to change them but you doing what you need to do to create an sense of peace and strength for yourself. Well you asked what I would do and that's what i would do. Being angry is a natural reaction but it never productive in situations like this one. It just makes one bitter. So  continue to reaffirm your daugther she is loved. I'm glad your daughter has such a great mother!|`|3cb731f486b5c9fc22f985e406eb3575aa	theirs really not that much you can do............... she could play him at his own game and not be around when he wants to visit or she could try to get your ex and his family together and try explain how the situation makes her feel...........its your daughters choice to make  and i wish her all the best|`|c6665eae099029f531965fd3f77cb51baa	Wow, go see a shrink.|`|AA12354853	sounds like something i've seen in a family that I know. It's completely normal for your daughter (and for you for that matter) to feel pretty confused about what's going on. I think it might be a good idea to try to talk to her and see how she feels about it. Does she want to see her dad (i'm just guessing it's her dad) and the people on that side of the family? If he really doesn't then I think the best thing to do is just stop the visits esp the dropping off and picking up). If they wanna see her, they shoud come over. The instability in those relationships just confuses your daughter and may even make her wonder what she did wrong and why daddy and his family don't love her. So decide how you feel about it, is it important for you as a mother for those relationships to be developed, and see how your daughter feels about it too.  Good luck!|`|db1e9b07cbcf056027de341ceb3b9713aa	You and your daughter need to talk to a counciler, she needs counciling now, before she becomes a teenager and doesn't have the skills to handle the hurt feelings she has. It will come out as anger, and there will be worse problems for you and her. You need to talk to a counciler to learn how to deal with the father, and his family. I am not an expert, but dealt with similar things. The counciler can suggest things that you don't think of and they can be a lot of help. Good Luck, it is half the battle to ask for help.|`|b503decfa8ea3699827b93fe06c87c4faa	i know that one so well, have done it all try to sort things but still the same     all you can do is be there for your children and do the best you can do     hope it gets better, all the best|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	It all comes down to your daughter, after all it is all about the children.  Do whatever it takes to keep them in her life, next time you talk to them (calmly) let them know your daughter's feelings and how she needs them in her life.  Don't ever say anything derogatory to your daughter about them, it will only make her feel worse.  Reassure her that they do love and what a wonderful child she is.  Good luck.|`|66b6ef808239da999e0dfcb3682818d1aa	Sometimes, sweetie you need to put your foot down. I think you need to have your daughter write a letter to each of these people asking what she wants from them (it can be anything; they're time, her father, etc.) & you should write a letter, too expressing how you feel about what your daughter wrote in her letter.  One day when your daughter isn't around you need to sit down and have a private & personal chat with her dad, his sister, his brother, and his mom. Express how you're feelings honestly with them and allow them to express their opinions honestly. Now, I must warn you this conversation can make or break your relationship with these people but express to your daughter what may happen and why.  OR you can have her dad spend one day with her and let her explain how she feels to him; let him and her have a conversation. Before they talk, let him know how much he's hurting her and their relationship.|`|109c798a3c8dbf8044e1b2c4d6ae3a62aa	tell him 2 eff off

Some people say, once a cheater, always a cheater. If you really like the guy, give him another chance. Surely it will take you time to rebuild your trust in him, and respect for him, so I suggest you tell him that, and pray to God he isn't one of those types who makes a habit out of it.    Goodluck!|`|91fd08d9bc3cc51c7146d43928395ab0aa	He has been open with you and told you everything,and also apologised. give him another chance.

The fact that he didnt tell you shows he wasnt being honest in some ways obviously.  Think about it...you would have never known probably had it not been 4her.  How is that fair 2 you? Its possible he was looking 4 a rebound bcuz he was hurt over your break up, & its natural (NOT ok, but normal most times) 4 a man 2 retaliate in their own way by going elsewhere 2 fulfill their own needs, or their own hurt over something.  Either way, with your own issues he should have been the 1 supporting you thru your troubles, rather than thinking about himself.  Whatever the case, if you truly love him you can see what chances there are of the 2 of you working past this, if you GENUINELY care 4 one another & you believe in your heart that its mutual..  otherwise, move on bcuz there's no sense in setting yourself up 4 more heartache.  And what are the chances of him & this "friend" hooking up again.  I know i never sleep with any of my friends, but you know him better than we do, so thats your judgement call.  Good luck, keep your head up thru everything.  Time heals all wounds & life's lessons are meant 2 make us stronger, not break us down, so the world wont end if you do decide 2move on, true love or not.|`|9ca8d1695fa683524d797c2169b0a76baa	you guys werent together 4 those 2 days...so he could do wutever the hell he wanted to....BUT....on the other side...he still shouldnt has sex with the first girl he saw...if he really loved you he would not have done that|`|6c137e92a5d640f73ab3aca50c252f6faa	you shouldn't trust him anymore   and just try to forget about it|`|a01b5104e10a1a8830c7fcb88c9e6253aa	Oh, no .... find yourself another guy.

If they were friends before, how do you know that they weren't fooling around behind your back? I would dump him and move on. But if you truly love him then you need to sit him down and find out where this other woman fits into your relationship. I hope everything works out for you.
25fbc8af3ff6170192fe178347d6330caa	You're really putting a lot of effort into these questions. I have to give you credit for that, at least. Also your grammar and spelling are better than most of the other questions and although you're not totally free of errors, they are fairly minor ones.  In this one, I appreciate that you let us know that the funeral was for a man that died. That really cleared things up for me, narrative-wise.   Overall, I like how your stories are basically the same story but each is in a different setting. I cannot handle too much variety without dizziness and slight nausea. Which is why I liked Borat and watch CSI.  Not only should you sue the people from your stories, George Lucas should pay you for doing such great public work in the name of one of his most beloved characters.

It is a trend that working moms want to bring the child to the company daycare and you being a mother is just the thing they are looking for... no experience needed but your training and get your school to help.  You are not a failure. I lived a sheltered life to and when into nursing home training with the   Red Cross add up 10 years of experience with the elderly and they are bigger children. .. Hard on the back of course in the lifting department.  High Chairs Wheel Chairs whats the difference ...Husband is to prove his love and protection for you as you get on your feet to help him.

Unfortunately he was constantly working and kept apologising and saying I would lose interest...   In the end I did and stopped texting...  He never text me either..    However, I don't hold a grudge and he was a nice guy, so I text him to say happy new year, within minutes he had text back saying he thought I would never speak to him again for messing me around so much.   I told him that was the way things went and that I wasn't prepared to lose a friend over something as silly as him being busy...    He been texting me regularly since, even asked me what I was doing tonight but I had already agreed to babysit for my sister...    I don't know what is gonna happen now, if anything, but it's turned the tables and its certainly made me feel better... Just knowing that he was genuinely interested, just the timeing was wrong..    Won't say you should do the same thing, but just hope my experiences help you make an informed decision..    Good luck.

Imgen de cuando mam estuvo embarazada, otra de cuando era beb, luego cuando estuvo en kinder, luego en primaria y en secundaria, haciendo mencin de alguna ancdota muy graciosa que robe la risa a familiares y amigos,  y concluir con este da tan importante. Tambin hacerle 15 regalos significativos personalizados, es decir, que todos tengan su nombre. Pueden ser: una playera, una taza, una pluma, un reloj, un portarretrato, un diario, una toalla, un libro con su separador, etc.  Estoy segura de que le encantar.

127aeb603908ed65c1f4f8ab7dcc96e9aa	Try memory snapshots...where you list some of your favorite moments with her & most importantly WHY they are so memorable to you. Try think of little things that are a little more obscure and random than the usual first kiss, first time I saw you ect.    If you have a hard time thinking of stuff like this, try to remember all the moments she's ever given you that butterfly-in-you-tummy feeling and what she was doing that caused it.    Reasons your girl will like this:    1) Girls like to know you are paying attention to details  2) We ALWAYS want to know what you're thinking about  3) We ESPECIALLY ALWAYS want to know how you feel  4) Girls need reassurance that you're "into" them.    What you already have sounds great though.    You don't have to do too much though...sometimes less can be more. You can always save some stuff for a regular day when she might need a little pick me up...that's when those kinds of things mean the most.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	You are so sweet.

22e22f01e44ca6b3d1b505e606184f27aa	Try reading "The Five Love Languages" by Gary Chapman  I have always looked at relationships,professional or personal, as an  investment. Each person invests something of themselves into the relationship with the expectation of getting either the same or more in return. A happy relationship is when both parties make emotional and mental deposits for profit or a bigger withdrawal. If one is getting a lower "output" that what they're "investing," then the relationship will brake down or create an inbalance between the two. One will be  lonely or dissatisfied and the other will be oblivious to the fact.|`|b1de0a3ad13b3338680518e8ead3b6deaa	Sounds like he has intimacy issues. You can't change a man.

You need to look for other signs and accept that this is the way he is. Perhaps he does some little thing that makes your world a better place, that is his affection. I know if I am pushed to be touchy feely, it really pisses me off so much that I have to truly be totally absent of that person for days. I don't think he should have to keep confirming his love for you over and over and over. Relationships are about accepting how the other person is.

Are you sure that you won't run after anything else thereafter?    Grow up man, all that you are talking about is your greed. You can live a completely content life with what you are if you start enjoy doing what you are doing. The result would be the same. You would still earn, still save and improve your standards. But if you keep thinking about more and more money, you will never be satisfied. Result - you may earn the money but not satisfaction...    :-)

Bueno en lo personal creo q a los chikos no les duele!!! yo tenia la misma idea, y a mi me dolio y a mi chiko no, hasta creyo q le estaba mintiendo!!!! ya q le dije q m dolia, pero si esperas a q t prendas bien y t lubriqs bien no duele tanto y lo dejas ahi unos momentos kietesito y se va el dolor!!! como dijo uno de los chikos es como las muelas ???t duele pero no kieres q t la saquen!!!    suerte y si lo haces solo usa proteccion y prendet bien!!!!|`|ff29511f5989277eac995716e0769a1aaa	Cada quien vive ese momento de distinta forma, no es lo mismo lo que vivio tu amiga que tu otra amiga, as que es algo ms psicologico, sobre el dolor, pues claro que duele, como todo en uan primera vez pero eso pasa con el tiempo...    si quieres ver cochinadotras entra a www.lolita4.mx.vg

I think it depends on the woman. I have been with some white women who didn't want to get down like i do and the same with black women. I have been with freaks in both races. The one thing I have found true is that black women usually make you work a little more to get oral whereas the white women i have been with do it pretty regularly.

I just don't understand why so man men and women cheat.  Cheating is such a sad thing in this world. She hurt herself by not having enough self respect for herself, she hurt you by not being honest and truthful in addition she is hurting the person she cheated with by continuing in this relationship.  It could be she is planning on meeting him somewhere.  It's really hard to say, just ask her.|`|AA11280073	You broke up but you still live together?

One of you should move out.  You caught her cheating and now she's off the hook. Meanwhile, this is probably still hurting you especially because you still live together and you will see every move she makes and always wonder what she's doing. This can drive a person insane.   You need time alone to hurt, think, grieve and then move on. I would even suggest you cut off communication with her. She's a trader and wouldn't be a good friend for you either.|`|ApFych6paa	Why should she text mes. you?  maybe her guy is coming over? but why would she want you to know that.?

Another alternative is visit WebMD and do a little research on hormonal and chemical changes in women and see what vitamins/supplements you can take that don't have weird side effects and are natural, which means a better response from your body.  People care, but don't understand the changes women go thru. No matter what you say, they won't understand. As soon as you start applying the advice given to you by the suggestions above, they'll just tell you, "Good to see you back".  Good Luck.|`|fc80088e2d0eb270ff0f74bb60031ebfaa	im in the same situation as you|`|qD1sAcGkaa	As you did not put down your age...I will have to answer this twice.    If you are young and having hormone changes due to growing...this will pass.    If you are older, than this is normal.  Change of life...is not easy.  Some people fly through it...while others get all sorts of side effects.  A doctor can give you meds, but they put you in the high risk level for cancer, high blood pressure and other things.  However...if you can find a copy of the 2002 AMA - American Medical  Association Journal...there is an article in there about a study of a med that does not promote cancer...etc., which I know works.  Ask your doctor...he/she will know.  I dont know if I am allowed to mention the drugs name on Yahoo, which is the only reason why I am not doing so.    As far as your family...no, they dont understand.  If your leg has never been broken...how could you comment to someone whos leg is broken on whether it hurts or not?  You can only give your opinions.    Stop telling them about it...because they are only going to be negative.  This way you dont have to deal with the problem...PLUS their attitudes towards it...talk to professional people who will understand and help.

You are basing your feelings for this guy on chemistry and wishful thinking and not on actually knowing him (or really, anything about him).     This is very likely because your marriage has a great big empty spot in it.       Good luck, and try to focus less on this guy and more on what you can do to feel better about your life without dragging another problem into it!  Dump the cheating husband and live on your own for awhile to find out what you really want, but don't get involved with someone else as a means of fixing the emptiness.

Pues bien, petting es una expresin inglesa y americana muy antigua, procedente del verbo "to pet", que alude al hecho de acariciar, mimar, besuquear... Aunque puede usarse en un sentido amplio,  cuando hablamos de relaciones sexuales, el pettng se convierte en un intercambio de muestras de afecto, en una especie de juego amoroso y placentero, en el que todo est permitido, excepto el coito.    En cuanto a los motivos que llevan a muchos jvenes a practicar esta forma de intercambio de caricias, prevalece por encima de todos el de evitar un posible embarazo cuando no se tienen a mano otros medios anticonceptivos o no se quiere recurrir a ellos. Otras razones pueden ser el miedo a contraer alguna infeccin o el deseo de conservar el himen intacto hasta la noche de bodas.  http://www.pediatraldia.cl/petting.htm  http://www.lacoctelera.com/fasg/post/200...  http://www.netdoctor.es/XML/verArticuloM...  http://www.informacionsexual.com/activid...  http://www.informacionsexual.com/activid...  http://www.lacuarta.cl/diario/2005/11/06...  http://www.enfemenino.com/__e2605-Pettin...  http://www.pediatraldia.cl/sexualidad_in...  http://www.informacionsexual.com/activid...  http://www.informacionsexual.com/activid...  http://pettingcreature.blogspot.com/  http://www.lacuarta.cl/diario/2006/07/09...  http://www.tnrelaciones.com/caricias/ind...  http://www.pediatraldia.cl/edadolecentes...  http://www.agenciasmatrimoniales.net/sex...  http://www.dkvseguros.com/awa/netdoctorn...  http://www.netdoctor.es/XML/articuloNet....  http://www.123.cl/adm_cont/mujer/novios/...  http://www.el-mundo.es/encuentros/invita...  http://www.jovenesadventistas.org/foroad...  http://pettingcreature.blogspot.com/2006...  http://www.arrakis.es/~cjas/preresp.htm  http://www.klip7.cl/blogsalud/sexo/2005/...  http://www.averlo.com/Parejas/index.html  http://www.descargascristianas.com/foro/...  http://www.heavypettingmetal.de/?p=26  http://supervision.mineduc.cl/1622/artic...  http://www.pediatraldia.cl/anticonceptiv...  http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://besovioleta.blogspot.com/2007/01/...  http://peru.lapapa.com.pe/cv/2011_7_t.ht...  http://www.noticias3d.com/noticia.asp?id...  http://www.xem.cl/estudiantes/archive/in...  http://www.agencia-matrimonial.net/sexua...  http://www.fisterra.com/human/1libros/cb...  http://www.xem.cl/estudiantes/archive/in...  |`|bc44ac4ccd132ddac88239af73bd7242aa	ni idea...
