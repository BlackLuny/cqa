20090130202948AABu1zv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why is my laptop so loud?	I have a Mac Powerbook G4, and it's driving me insane. It won't shut the hell up. It's been loud for a few weeks now, and I thought that a bottle of compressed air would take care of the problem, considering it's never been cleaned. I lifted the keyboard, and sprayed the crap out of it. I also sprayed it in the holes on the sides and back (the holes in the back actually had dust built up around it). But obviously that isn't going to work since all it did was spray the dust back inside it... I do not want to take it apart, because I'm afraid I will break something and/or be forced to take it to some technician to put it back together. But if I must, I will. Please help, this must be stopped. I think it's overheating...      Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Everytime I open up my computer it says "Windows could not start up properly"  Then gives me a list of things I can choose from ->  Safe Mode  (3 more selections that I cant remember)  or Start Windows normally.    First I said to just start it normally and see what happens, when I got up to my user login screen, my computer restarted itself.   Second time, I chose safe mode, logged in, then used the computer backup thing, that brings my computer back to a checkpoint when it was fine. Then my computer started itself again and didn't even make it to the login screen.  Third time, I managed to login, then I ran my windows backup, then 2 minutes later, my computer restarted again.  I gave up after 3 tries, had dinner, and now I'm back. I turned my computer off, and now back on.  The fourth time, the screen still showed up about it not being able to start properly, I just clicked start normally, and I got into my account. I don't know if this is going to work in the future? Or will I be restarted in a couple of minutes or what? What do I do? :(    Any help would be gladly appreciated.  Sorry if some parts didn't make sense, I typed this as fast as I could without thinking in fear of my computer restarting again.  Thanks!

Make up a whole different side of you - maybe what your dream lfe would be like. If someone wants to know something about you, them something about the dream life. Like a fake name, pets, family - your whole life. That way there is *basically* no secrets being kept from new friends. They could keep their identity a secret while giving out unusable information. They could keep all information the same on all sites, that way no one suspects a thing. my question to you (again) is:       Is this safe or unsafe?

I know that it you need to convert if for the Ipod to beable to play it.  But what can I use to get it onto the Ipod touch.  Please don't share a program that's going to convert it, and then at the end, it says to put into Itunes.  The problem is not the converting the file to mpeg4, it's getting it to Ipod Touch without the use of Itunes.  Freeware or Shareware.  Doesn't matter though free would be nice.   Any Suggestions

Okay I just bought an enV2 NEW off of Ebay about two months ago and I am having problems with it.      1.* The phone will not charge unless I hold in the charger & if I go and turn the phone off to charge it, when I plug the charger in the phone automatically turns on without pressing the END button.      2.* The outside OKAY button has been having problems, I hear a lot of enV2's do this but I am not positive. It freezes and only works sometimes. Or if I constantly press it down superhard rapidly a couple times then It will work.      Does any one else's phone have this problem?      3.* What will verizon do if I tell them about this, will they give me a new one free or will they make me pay 50$. Or will they not give me anything at all since my contract wasn't up when I bought the phone on EBAY.?         & It has never been dropped, water damaged, etc.

20090130185818AAvx7so	Computers & Internet;Security	Is Windows "Administrator" account pretty useless or what?	I was running AVG anti virus, it started having a memory leak so I tried to kill it as an administrator, but it says access denied? Umm what part of being administrator does windows not understand? I tried force quit, still denied. I tried to lower it's priority still denied. I tried using process explorer to kill the threads and tasks of AVG still denied.       so I uninstalled AVG and it required a reboot anyways, which finally fixed it. The Admin account here is pretty worthless.      Then I go into control panel and go into administrative tools, then I go into computer management  and connect to another computer, I connect to a PC I know is in my network and it connects fine then I try to do ANYTHING administrative and it tells me I don't have permission, access denied, nothing here works. Another pointless aspect of the administrative account.       So I type the name of my local machine \\nameoflocalmachine\ADMIN$ and it sits there for like a minute and a half frozen then finally pops up a login screen with a greyed out "\\nameoflocalmachine\Guest" requesting a password, I never said to login as guest and that account is disabled on the machine anyways. I wanted to connect as Administrator (hence it being called administrative shares) I tried C$ also and it did the same thing.       So my question is, Why is Windows XP's administrator account so weak, so frail and so useless? I can do absolutely nothing with this administrative-access denied-weak account.       In Linux I say Sudo su   login   and I can do "ANYTHING" I demand to do to the machine, why is windows XP so weak?

20090130185928AAfqIT9	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What is a good program to check your PC specs in real-time?	What's a good program I can get to show what specs my PC is running at in real-time without me having to restart and go check the BIOS all the time?       If it helps the reason I need it is because my CPU Temp runs too hot (PC is near the heater and gets hot inside in the winter) and when it gets to 76 C or so it'll revert my CPU overclock multiplier from 9x to 6x, which significantly decreases the performance of everything. I would like to be able to check if this has occurred without having to drop everything and restart.      Pretty much what I'm looking for is something that'll show the Ghz of my CPU in real-time (dxdiag is unreliable because it usually just shows what the PC was at when you turned it on.) Thanks!

I like it around 88% which is one step down.  I can change it and it will stay the same at the time, but whenever I close it/turn it off it goes right back to 100%!  Now on a normal computer I'd change it and then click apply or save...but I have Vista Viao and it doesn't have anything like that.  How can I keep it the way I want?  Thanks

After using the game several times after first install, opening the game (WinBej2.exe) jointly opens with another process (game.exe). Closing the Game.exe process shuts the WinBej2.exe process down as well, but not vice-versa.      Installing, reinstalling, uninstalling the game hasn't worked. Reinstalling Windows worked for a short time, then it recurred. (Windows Vista Ultimate, Service Pack 1)      It's my understanding that Game.exe is a known worm, but it is undetectable by any antivirus, anti-malware or removal tool I have used. Where is it coming from, and how do I get rid of it?      (PLEASE don't send me links to off-the-wall websites, or programs that scan your system and come back with a "6,612 errors found!

20090130192349AAENm2g	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Starting a Gaming Company?	I have a bunch of ideas that I would like to put into practice regarding designing a video game. I may be attending a college for game design and am already getting familiar with C++ and the other aspects of game design. Realizing that it would be almost impossible (Or would take an extreme long amount of time) to design a game myself, I would need a team of developers to help me out. This would probably mean I would have to start my own company.    The only problem is, how would I be able to pay the people who work for me a decent salary until the game actually launches (having no money prior and probably not getting THAT much to pay them with a start up loan). I would estimate it would take 3 years most likely to have the game fully designed, and I have no idea where I could get the money for that.    If anyone knows of how I would be able to have the money to pay for a team of developers salary, among every other thing needed (building space, equipment), I would appreciate your help.

I know it may seem like alot, but I would like to know what my system may be worth if I were to sell the entire thing! Everything Works Perfectly and EVERYTHING is in Perfect condition. I will also assume selling it without the Operating System. I use Windows XP Home and it runs Flawless and FAST!! I will list my system first and then I have a few more updates I would still like to do to my system before it is complete. I am just curious how much I would gain if I sold it now compared to selling it with my finished updates.

As well as a Scythe Speaker set.       I have recently started this hobby building computers. I really LOVE it. I only build them for myself and family though for right now. I do know it saves a lot of money compared to store bought junk. So I am actually considering starting this as a part time job. So I was just curious what the resale value of these are after a build.
