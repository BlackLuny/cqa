SslUWT0Jaa	me too!!! I used to always be a hungry little child, but now that I'm almost done growing, I never feel hungry.  If I didn't have a kitchen I don't think I'd hardly ever eat.  only time I know when I'm hungry is when my tommy grumbles.  I mean I can eat alot or nothing and my stomach feels the same.  I'm trying to loose some flub on my stomach and thighs now, so I'm ok with it.  I want to know if its a side effect of something.  I now started taking vitams because I feel that I'm eating so little that I can't physically be getting the right amount of anything.

1wFMGizXaa	You don't really need to lose weight.     1600 calories is normal. Being a little lower or high than that would be fine, too. If you're not going to exercise, your daily calorie count needs factor that into consideration.     Also, without knowing exactly what you ate, I can't say whether your diet was good. If you ate 1600 calories worth of desserts versus 1600 calories of lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, then that's quite a difference.|`|Js7qSh01aa	Why are you trying to lose weight at 115 lbs?! Maybe you should look into getting some help with your self esteem issues first.|`|aW59AbDaaa	You may not like to hear it, but I agree 100% with the other answer.  Why on earth are you dieting when you're not overweight?  All you are accomplishing is setting yourself up for an assortment of anxieties and obsessions in your life.  In particular, why are you asking us to judge whether you may have eaten about 100 Calories too much today?  We have no way of measuring your base metabolic rate or what comprises your "daily living activities" or what additional activities are part of "etc".|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	I'd say 1600 cal/per day is too much if you want to lose weight.  Especially if you didn't burn up any extra energy by exercising.  So what you ate that your body doesn't need will be stored as fat....

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	With bipolar, you get times of hypomania or mania where you are only sleeping say 2 to 4 hours a night, and it isn't insomnia, you just don't NEED any more sleep & don't want to sleep, because it's a waste of time. You get up in the middle of the night to work on your novel, or repaint the kitchen.  You get really sexed up. Blow money on stuff you don't need, like perfume if you never wear perfume, or 5 identical blouses because they were on sale.  If someone tells you to stop pounding on the piano in the middle of the night, you get mad at them because they are interfering with "your work."  You can also get mixed moods, which is depression and mania together, which is a more agitated type depression, where you are really restless and ruminating on negative thoughts like crazy, on and on and on.  Go to bipolarworld.net to Ask the Doctor. He has a bipolarity screening test there. If you come up with a lot of bipolar type symptoms, then you need to be back on lithium or some other mood stabilizer. You were probably allergic to the ablify.  Ask your primary doc if there is another GP that has taken a real interest in psychiatry & go see that GP instead for this problem.  Otherwise, ask around and see if there are any community psychiatry clinics.  Psychiatrists do a lot better job at treating depression, research shows.|`|P6atY3xXaa	I'm also bipolar.  I get my therapy for free and meds for $5 a month each script (if he doesn't have samples to give me).    Hunt around for a state mental health facility to visit so it won't cost you but according to your income.    It will only get worse if you don't care for it.    I wish you well.    Debbie|`|E0rJfuZcaa	Seek medical advice. Nobody here can diagnose mental disorders.
TC21ao0Paa	Just tell your Doc as to how you have been feeling. Tell him/her all of your symptoms or, write them all down so that you don' t forget to mention your symptoms. If you choose to write your symptoms done, remember to bring it to your appointment. He/she can order any testing that may be needed. I'm sure that you'll will be given a Doc's note for school, depending on what your symptoms are and,  whether you are contagious or, not.   What are your symptoms ??    I hope that this helps and that you feel better soon.

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	Yes, you can.  This is called a monovision contact lens fit.  Will you be successful?  That is a VERY different question.  Doing this demands that your brain learn to suppress (turn off) the eye that is not being used for any given task.  When you are looking at a distant object your brain must ignore your near eye.  Just the opposite when you a reading.  For some reason, some people can learn to do this quite easily and some people it just simply drives them crazy.  The only way to know if you can do this successfully is to try.  So just go in and let your doctor fit you and cross your fingers.|`|RgwJ1PNnaa	I know someone who does this and they love it and can see near and far. Sounds a good idea if you can get used to it.

d6M0jmIkaa	What you want to do is look at the severity of your symptoms and how long your mood swings last.  Normally, in Bipolar disorder each mood swing will last for weeks or months.  You will be severely depressed for months at a time, and then you will be overly happy for weeks or months at a time with periods of normal mood in between.  These moods are nonreactive to things that happen in your life, you'll be happy no matter what happens, or sad no matter what happens.  Although there are triggers that can spark an episode.    When you're hormonal the mood swings usually happen several time a day and are provoked by something, even if the mood is an over reaction.  Like you'll be really mad at what your mom said, then you'll be sad.  Then you'll think of something your friend said and be happy again.  There are clear reasons for your mood swings ,all though they are all out of proportion.    More importantly, Bipolar disorder is more than just mood swings, there are a plethora of other symptoms that go along with the disorder.  Read over the web-site I gave you and it should be much clearer.    It is important, though, not to self-diagnose.  The only way to know for sure is to got to your doctor and tell him/her about your symptoms.|`|eDKSKqcSaa	Bipolar involves a very distinct pattern of depression and mania. Each phase of mania or depression  will last for around a month to a year (or more if untreated) and there often is a period of 'normal' mood before the phase changes. Rarely people can be diagnosed with 'rapid cycling' bipolar and will go from depression to mania from week to week. This is a good way to think about whether it is just puberty - do you find your mood changes quite quickly and you have different moods in the same day? If yes its really unlikely you have bipolar.  This is a very simplified way of describing Bipolar disorder but I hope it helps with you concerns. Puberty is crazy but fun and exciting too once you get a grip of it! Talk to friends.. some of them might feel the same way. Good luck honey!|`|aQSo5KMzaa	Excellent Question - this is an issue that is difficult for even trained professionals to distinguish.  It's very hard to diagnose in many cases and there are many misdiagnosis.|`|AA10451030	You don't. The only way to know is to go to a psychiatrist and wait to see if he diagnoses you with anything. Talk to your parents about mental disorders that run in the family, and ask your mom what puberty was like for her.    EDIT    I was unlucky and went through puberty and had (have) bi-polar disorder. It can be well confused. I'm sorry to say, but my parents thought it was just purberty until I started cutting. Then I had to go through 2 years longer before I was diagnosed. In addition, there is no test to see if you are bi-polar, all we have right now is observation. The closest you will get to a 'test' is a sheet asking about mood, sleeping and eating patterns.|`|e2J4r10Raa	I have a family member who is bipolar and before he was diagnosed he went absolutely crazy. It was bad. If you are concerned enough I would recommend going to a doctor and getting tested or something. I had two older sisters and they never were too crazy when they were teenagers.|`|qYlkAyiJaa	I always thought it was probably normal, and I never would have asked for help anyway, but.... eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 19. What really sent to me a doctor was the fact that my moods were ruining my life. I was doing terribly in school and my boyfriend and I almost broke up because of me being out of control. I went in for a yearly checkup in May after my freshman year of college (I was barely 19), and I told my general practitioner that I thought I was having problems with being too moody. I was surprised how concerned she instantly became and she told me that it was possible that I have bipolar disorder, especially since it's a little more common in people with ADD, and I promised her I'd check it out with a counselor when I went back to school. It was really hard to tell my parents that I thought I had a problem like that, but they of course wanted me to get help even though they didn't really want to believe I had it until after I went to see two different psychiatrists. I/they then accepted that my GP, counselor, and two psychiatrists might be onto something with the bipolar disorder diagnosis... I am 21 now and I am the happiest I have ever been after a few years of counseling and adjusting medication. I am not perfect, but I feel like my life is way more under MY control instead of my emotions' control. If you do turn out to have bipolar disorder, I really suggest you see a counselor once a week-- it helps me as much as the medication does I think, and she knows what direction I'm heading in (manic or depressed) before I do now, which is extremely helpful.    If your mood swings are screwing up your social, work/school, and/or family life, you need to see a doctor, because it will only get worse if you don't get help.|`|wKXUfedMaa	Bipolar disorder is a lot more serious then a hormonal outburst.  I would say depending on the time span of the episodes(?).  Another way would be to see what triggers the emotion and how serious they become. Bipolar involve two extreme mood swings ergo puberty would probably not be as dramatic as bipolar.

930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I always knew that something was off. My mind races, like it's faster than my body. It always has. I can't shut my thoughts off at night, and I would do things at weird times. Like scrubbing the oven at 2 am. Can't concentrate for the life of me at times. I always just thought it was due to stress and issues from when I was a kid. It bothered me that I couldn't sit down and read a book. Not that I didn't want to, I physically can't do it. I never thought it was something that had a name, just something I had to live with.  I didn't know what it was though until a Dr asked me a few things and told me that I was ADHD.  After that I started looking into it, and many of the things I have been having issues with fit what it is.  So no, many people with mental health issues don't know it, until it is brought to their attention, or happen upon the information and put two and two together.
rwbUF975aa	Really depends on what type of workout you do at the gym.

Also you can put sports creams on it like Absorbine junior to make sure that stiffness/lactic acid buildup doesn't occur.  Other than that just be careful with your knees, if they feel constantly sore maybe take a break from leg exercises.  The knees aren't muscles as much as a collection of ligaments so it's more just keeping them healthy than strengthening them.  You don't want to tear anything, especially at 15.|`|HpqGnCFAaa	STRETCH before any running or exercise. I know it seems really stupid but its really important and will help.

CNS depression and/or stimulation may occur. Hypothyroidism is unlikely to develop after a single acute overdose ingestion. Less frequently, overdose may result in hepatic enzyme changes or neuropathies."  Carbimazole crosses into the womb of pregnant women readily and can cause goiter and cretinism in developing babies.    As for PTU:  "Very little data are available on the effects of acute overdose.  In the only reported case of PTU overdose, decreased T3 and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were the only effects seen after a massive overdose in a 12-year-old girl."  T3 is triiodothyronine, the most bioactive thyroid hormone in the body.

2sycPf8Daa	Shortness of breath (dyspnea) is a worrisome symptom and has many acute and chronic causes.Being short of breath  is one of the scariest conditions.  Chest pain is a symptom of a number of serious conditions and is generally considered a medical emergency. Chest pain is one of the most frightening symptoms a person can have.    Having sharp stinging pain in the lower part of your heart. A common cause of chest pain is called Stable Angina.  Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that typically occurs with activity or stress. The pain usually begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away. It quickly goes away with medication or rest, but may happen again with additional activity or stress.    Stable angina is also called chronic angina. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left. It may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. The pain may spread to shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, back, or other areas.   Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion.     Shortness of breath?Chest pain? The list of potential causes in long and may take a little bit of time to determine the precise cause. I am not a doctor, but you dont have to give up. Do not stop here!Continue to see your doctor regularly you sound very anxious.   In conclusion I suggest encouraging yourself to be more open to your doctor. A good Internal Medicine doctor should be able to work through the potential causes of your symptoms: chest pains and shortness of breath.    Take shortness of breath seriously. Seek immediate medical care.   Take care always! OIRAM|`|WadzK6ejaa	Go to doctor to have full checkup though you may have chest muscle strain .asthma but you need to do EKG .echo ...etc

If you crack your back/neck you can very easily become paralyzed|`|cz6s5EZXaa	i dont think so.. i crack my neck and back all the time.. and i actually recently had a car accident.. and when i go to the chiropractor.. they crack my back neck...every single day.. so i dont think its bad.|`|NsYIUu3caa	the cracking sound you hear is air leaving the joints. you may notice increased range of motion afterwards, the downside is it may lead to arthritis later in life
2LpWgU20aa	mix honey and lemon juice together, take a spoonfull of that and let it drizzle down your throat- it may tickle but it tastes good and will help your throat feel better. Any type of citrus will clean out the bacteria and get you feeling better in no time. also gargle with lots of salt mixed in warm water- it tastes nasty but it works--the saltier and hotter, the better. Hope these tips work for you as it does for me!|`|BUOodnNRaa	If the cough is a dry cough, drinking tea with honey and lemon helps.     If you have a lot of phlegm in your throat/chest, salvia officianalis [sage] tea is very good for you. Licorice root tea is also good.|`|nSWGp1vQaa	you should try gargling with hot water with salt in it =)|`|fsHgUrcAaa	My favorite home remedy for cough is to get a tablespoonful of honey, add a little hot tea to it and take it like medicine.  Then drink the hot tea as hot as you can stand it.    I do this for my two-year old since I don't want to give her medicine for her cough.  It usually works for her, the only exception is I give her warm tea.|`|UQgjNliWaa	have some irish coffee - my mother had a persistent cough last year and she drank irish coffee (but only 1-2 a day) and eucalyptus gum or sweets. oh, and you should try honey and lemon mixed in warm water because it calms your chest and try inhaling some eucalyptus oil by putting a bit on ur pillow or use an oil burner or just inhale it from the bottle.  hope this helps :)|`|AA10131801	Slather Vics on the bottom of your feet at night and put socks on.

Also, very important don't forget to sleep with a humidifier on.|`|Z9YvZsA6aa	I read that you can rub vicks on the bottom of your feet, sleep with socks on, and wake up feeling brand new.

Yx5iSat4aa	I'd stay away from sex for a lot longer than 7 days.|`|KLGtR4vqaa	if it was Azithromycin you took than it takes 16 -17 days to officially get out your system but it take about a week for everything to go back to normal like having sex or drinking, jus make sure you didnt drink in the hours before and after taking the tablets as it takes 19hours after you take them to start attacking the infection.    Hope it helps|`|pOjPwxo8aa	I would call your prescribing doctor and ask them directly. It would be terrible to have some bad side effects from following the advice of someone who might not really know.

I'd say go to a cardiologist, just to be sure.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	I would suggest you consider going to see a gynecologist, dear.  You may have a particularly tough hymen- it does happen.  The gyn can slit it to allow sex to be a bit more comfy and save you the misery of having it torn.  The only other option is to try a lot of water based lubricant, and tell the BF to take it nice and slow.  While he is doing that, you need to learn to relax a little bit.  It's not a matter of tight or loose- the muscles of the vaginal canal are under your control and if you are nervous or frightened that can quite easily make sex nearly impossible or painful at best.  You also didn't mention using birth control of any sort.  If you aren't, the idea that you could get pregnant doing this is also enough to make you key up to the point sex is difficult.  So while you are at the doctor's office, you may want to arrange for some birth control to avoid that worry in the future.  You still need to use a condom, but two forms of birth control are the best idea.  Just go see the gynecologist now.  If you are old enough to have sex, it's time.|`|OLy54IDOaa	both probably. <br>  you need to stay relax or it wont work. use lub to|`|rbb4fMAwaa	well, the question is how far? if its about 6 inches, he's hitting the cervical opening. This is completely normal. <br>  <br>  You have to be really careful, especially the first few times, especially if the guy is a decent enough size. It can be a little of a shock. I still have that issue sometimes. <br>  <br>  Your hymen is actually surprisingly easy to break. Most women, if they are actually born with one as some aren't, break them riding a horse or bike or something else of this sort. Also, it could never break and merely stretch. <br>  <br>  The thing is, when you have sex, you really have to be ready. That is the point of foreplay after all. The walls of the vagina have to balloon out and such, and this doesn't happen if you aren't in the mood, and even then, he has to be careful to make sure he works up to full-blown sex.|`|nOTS9oS9aa	If you really want sex, and your hymen is so strong that your boyfriend can't breach it, your always have the possibility to let it surgical remove.<br>  I am only mention this, because where I come from. girls let their hymen repair out of concern of retaliation from their male relatives. So, consequently, it is possible to remove it, too.|`|jJjfeylmaa	it might help to have him eat you out before you guys have sex, that way you are more turned on before he goes in you. then just have him go real slowly and a little bit at a time, and you will loosen up and eventually enjoy it! :) good luck|`|58X0RRPgaa	Lubrication! <br>  Use it!|`|1NTiXAFxaa	It is definitely your hymen if you haven't bled then technically you are still a virgin
c84a1d17484d06ded093e2e049596aaeaa	According to the article you provided, this amoeba lives in DIRTY swimming pools. I'm a lifeguard at the YMCA and believe me, public swimming pools are very carefully kept clean. Just think about how much public pools smell like chlorine. That chemical would kill these amoeba if it entered the pool.     Also, the article says that most commonly these amoeba are found in lakes. You weren't swimming in any lakes, and the dust and dirt in your home is filled with bacteria, but not bacteria from lakes. You're already immune to anything that lives in the dust in your home.     Plus, these amoeba love heat. At the moment it's winter, so unless you live in the south, they would be dead in any water at the moment.    Remember, reporters like to tell about really dramatic diseases and stuff to entice public interest. This amoeba has killed only 29 times in  the last twelve years. Think about how many people died from AIDS, or cancer, or even just the flu in the last twelve years-- but I doubt you're running around worried about those diseases commonly. It would be a lot more than that. So don't panic. You'll be fine.|`|IGsAQAHMaa	YOU ARE DOOMED!! And your friend too!  It's going to totally be like Night of the Living Dead.  The bacteria will eat your brain and then you will be a zombie, eating other people's brains!!!    Just kidding.  I would prescribe that you watch a lot less news on TV and read more.  Television news shows are all tabloids.  Especially their websites.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	No, the germs will die in the air or once they're ground into the carpet or whatever. You really need to get the live amoeba in the water into your nose to even possibly get this illness, and it can't live if it isn't between like 75-95 degrees and wet. If its snowy where you live there's basically no chance of it being near you, and I doubt the pool is warm enough or dirty enough to even have any of the amoeba.    Also I'm pretty sure chlorine from the pool will kill the amoeba almost all the time. Even if its in the pool (which statistically speaking is nearly impossible any time of the year) you would need to snort the pool water basically to even have a chance of getting it. Almost all the cases of it are actually from lakes. It is not in tap water, nor is it in your plants dirt or even outside except in rare cases in hot summer.     This disease is really really rare so you should not worry about it at all. Do you worry about other illnesses too or other bad things happening to you or to others? Sometimes this is a sign of anxiety or other psychological stuff going on. If you do worry a lot you should talk to your parents/doctor/school counselor about it.
AA11311516	My boyfriend has this, and we just went to get his eyes examined and I asked the optometrist what it is. He said it could be:<br>  <br>  A. an allergic reaction to something<br>  <br>  B. a symptom of dry eyes. ( I know right?, its watering not dry) but the way explained it is that the eye is sending a message to the brain for more water and the water  comes but the eye is still dry..something like that. <br>  <br>  try either taking a benadryl when its watering or using eye drops during the day (when its not watering) and see if you notice a difference.|`|4i2e231Oaa	Mine do the same thing, or did the same thing.

KSUPtqCaaa	If you have had multiple infections, you are at great risk for more if you do not remove the piercing. Furthermore, one of these infections could cause severe complications.<br>  <br>  That said, if you choose to keep the piercing, then you need to take better precautions. First, be sure to bathe daily (not everyone does, so I have to be sure to mention it). Second, be sure to use a germ killer such as hand sanitizer around the piercing regularly. This will help kill any bacteria that may be near there; but don't use so much that it causes irritation.<br>  <br>  Also, you will want to clean your nostrils (this sounds weird, I know); but Staph (including MRSA) can be harbored in the nares. You can accomplish this by just using a salt-water flush once or twice daily.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to remove it, then you can consider replacing it in a few months; but do so under supervision from your physician.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	i think it would be best to take it out and let things heal, although if you choose to have a piercing, it very well could be the jewelry that you have in there as well , maybe try a 14 carrot gold or somethng of that sort|`|wbSGa7m8aa	MRSA infections re-occur because antibiotics have little or no effect on the current strains that are found in the community. If you have MRSA, then it needs to be eradicated. Removing the piercing will not remove the MRSA infection.<br>  <br>  Instead of asking questions here, refer to MRSA medical - A site that will offer you help with eradication and provide you with a host of knowledge.

IbrleShPaa	weed is a very interesting subject. it has medical uses for some patients.but if your dont have medical problems its a whole other thing.<br>  <br>  weed stuns brain cells but doesn't permanently vanish them. so in the long run its not bad. its your choic if you wanna smoke or not.makes you hungry and sometimes sleepy. people say you get stupid but wat is stupid? sometimes you understand things you would not sober.other times you cant understand anything. <br>  <br>  in my opinion weed makes you more spiritual,understanding,creative, happier, and nicer. weed to me is the strangest drug because you never know how your high is goin to be and what suprises will come. when you drink you know you going to get stupider, dissier and pretty much drunk. when you do acid you know your going to hallucinate. when you smoke weed you dont know if your going to get dissy, stupid, smart, paranoid, get lost or anything. smoking weed is an adventure.<br>  <br>  in my opinion try it and see how you like it. if you like it smoke it cuz theres nothing really bad about it. dont let that above the influence bull **** tell you otherwise. if you dont like it dont get peir pressured into doing it again.<br>  <br>  if you end up trying it and like it your life will never be the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  also if you do end up trying it dont be gay and go to harsher drugs. thats what weak people do. and also dont be the stupid stereotypical stoner and just smoke to sit around on your a s s doing nothing. go out and explore the world after you blaze. do it for creativity and spirituality also...its amazing<br>  <br>  god bless|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	CONS= It may alters your brain chemicals slightly, can lead to infertility.

GvQHw4Ntaa	The implantation bleeding would come roughly around the time of your expected period.. you ovulate approximately 14 days into your cycle and implantation bleeding occurs about 10 days after conception, so I'd expect it anywhere from 4 or 5 days before your expected period to the day of your expected period. <br>  <br>  Being tired and breaking out can be pregnancy symptoms - if you are pregnant, you're producing a lot of extra blood the first couple of weeks and your hormones are changing which could cause you to break out (especially if you usually have clear skin). Nipples typically don't become darker until a couple of months into the pregnancy, and although you may experience nausea early on, morning sickness usually doesn't occur until 6-8 weeks into the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Breast tenderness can be a pregnancy symptom... other times, it's not (this early on). For example, if you usually experience breast tenderness, it could just be a PMS symptom. If you don't normally experience breast tenderness, it could be a pregnancy symptom. Sometimes NOT experiencing breast tenderness when you normally do can be a pregnancy symptom, but that obviously isn't the case here. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you could be pregnant.. none of your symptoms are definitive. If your period is due in the next couple of days and you're really worried, it's not too soon to take one of the more sensitive pregnancy tests, like First Response. Just make sure you take it first thing in the morning, when the hormones in your urine will be most concentrated. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope everything turns out as you'd like.|`|zsOj9Ac0aa	COULD BE!!!

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	I bet your stomach does hurt.   Two glasses of prune juice would be enough to make anybody's stomach hurt, and combined with cramps- your poor innards probably don't know what hit them.  If you had explosive diarrhea, I think it's safe to say you were not as constipated as you thought you were.  Otherwise the prune juice wouldn't have worked quite so fast.  That typically takes at least a day to work.  You had the equivalent of a cork in the bottle, and you attacked it a little too vigorously, that's all.  How long your diarrhea continues depends on how much you have inside you to remove.  By tomorrow I image you should be nice and empty, with the exception of some gas- and that may be considerable.  Plan on drinking a lot of clear liquids, and sticking with white rice, apples, and toast or crackers to give your poor innards a break.  Stay away from all dairy products, because you just removed all the good bacteria you need for the digestion of them.  In about two or three days, have a carton or two of organic, live culture yogurt to replace those bacteria.  Eat a carton or two a day for two-three days, and then get back to a decent diet.  If you eat more fruits, veggies, and whole grain foods, and drink plenty of fluid, constipation should not be a problem.  In the future, I suggest you eat a couple of prunes, or have one glass of the juice to help promote regularity.  And don't go looking for such instantaneous results.  Bodies are usually happier if left to work as designed and on their own timetables.|`|r0XWK4cUaa	Hun, you'll be just fine.<br>  Next time i suggest you drink coffee though. especially the cold starbucks coffee you can buy at food4less. last time i was contipated, i drunk that and my **** flew out my *** like woah! it made a splashy niose in the toilet and wet my *** cheeks.|`|RQWyYV6Laa	Life is messy sweetheart!

You should be okay in the am.  Drink plenty of water.|`|0rpN2419aa	I think you will be fine.  The prune just just got things to moving after you had been constipated for awhile and everything should be out of you tonight.

You were very smart to drink the prune juice and walk on the treadmill!!!  Good for you!  <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better, and I'm sure it's a relief to get things moving.

Take an aspirin and place it on the sore and keep it there. The aspirin will dissolve. It will burn at first. Keep it there as long as possible. Once it really starts to dissolve rinse out your mouth with water a few times. <br>  <br>  The spot will feel rough from the astringent properties of the aspirin. The next day it should be healing up.
GiONso7zaa	if you lose 30 pounds you will weigh 105. 105lb at 5'6'' is way underweight. That would be unhealthy for you to lose that much weight.<br>  <br>  5'6'' is 66 inches. at 66 inches you need to weight between 118 to 142 to be considered at a healthy weight according to the BMI chart. (which is what nutritionists use to determine what a healthy weight it)
R9KvEhMxaa	I can comment from the perspective of doing research in the area of addiction recovery, primarily in compiling medical histories of recovering addicts. This information won't necessarily be universal, as there is somewhat of a selection bias in who shows up in such programs. However, what we see amongst them is quite uniform.<br>  <br>  LSD, and to a lesser degree other serotonergic hallucinogens appear to develop some psychiatric distress primarily in the realm of altered mood, typically tending towards the area of depression. Occasionally, cognitive impairments and other issues arise. There's not so much use of these drugs as in decades past, which is fortunate. The damage appears to arise as a result of the total number of uses over a person's lifetime, rather than any sort of chronic exposure or overdose. The dominant hypothesis for how this arises is that there's damage to either neurons receiving serotonergic innervation in the brain, or damage to the serotonin bearing axons. This does not seem to arise as a result of the drug used - that is chemical toxicity, but more along the lines of the uncontrolled neuronal activity that results. DMT is primarily a serotonergic hallucinogen as I recall, though it is not commonly used at all. I can't comment on it, as I have no experience with people who have used it.<br>  <br>  Cocaine, despite being one of the messiest addictions, does not appear to cause any sort of long term psychiatric distress. The primary danger seems to be acute - it's rather hard on the cardiovascular system, so you occasionally see things like strokes, aneurisms and heart attacks and the like. There does appear to be something like amphetamine psychosis with cocaine, but this appears to be an induced state by the drug, primarily showing up in long term heavy users. Withdraw the drug, and this appears to go away. Not a very popular drug these days, but still out there.<br>  <br>  Ecstasy is, unfortunately, quite popular these days, though becoming less so. It rather consistently induces psychiatric symptoms, apparently by a similar means to the serotonergic hallucinogens, but in a different area of the brain. Rather than heavy depression, there's a very consistent development of anxiety problems, starting within six months to several years after a person exceeds within 5 to 10 uses of the drug, though not always. It's quite odd how uniform it is. It generally starts with social withdrawal and a slight phobia of social interaction, progression to agoraphobia, generalized anxiety and panic. These get quite severe, and quite ugly. Also very difficult to treat. Since benzodiazepines are not to be used in cases of substance abuse, generally treatment has to resort to the stronger antidepressant medications, with mixed success.<br>  <br>  The above is gathered from working with doctors and research professionals in the area of substance abuse. Unfortunately, it does amount to being largely anecdotal. Legal and ethical concerns would make it impossible to do controlled studies on this.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Your question is to vague -- what do you mean be "experimenting"?  If you are talking about highly controlled scientific scenarios with guaranteed pure/clean stuff, that is one thing, but if you are just asking about people just trying this stuff to see "what's up", that's a whole other story.<br>  <br>  [Forgot to add]<br>  Might want to browse the Erowid vaults for information (see link)<br>  <br>  [MORE]<br>  OK, I see.  I'll relate a couple stories:<br>  <br>  1) A friend (this was in high school around 1970), consumed LSD repeatedly over a period of a year -- probably dropping tabs at least two or three times a week.  He grew progressively "disoriented" and finally died from exposure (25 F that night, wandered outside with just a small blanket for protection).  He was pretty messed up before he even started, so there's no saying that he wouldn't have found another way of doing himself in... i.e., not necessarily a direct link to the LSD, but of course that was everyone's conclusion.<br>  <br>  2) A college girlfriend (1975) ended up with a deviated septum attributed to near constant snorting of cocaine, and later had a cancer in her sinus that ended up eating much of her face 20 years later (of course, there's no sure way to draw a one-for-one link between the two).<br>  <br>  That's all I got.  Hope it helps.|`|I8fAJ1Bdaa	I can tell you that LSD, Ecstacy, and Cocaine have changed me for life. I don't know what they've done medically, but LSD has given me amazing insight into philosophical questions about existence, and many other things. Ecstacy has forever bonded me to my friends, and made us closer than we could ever be without it. Cocaine has haunted me for several years, and not a day has gone by where I haven't thought about it. It is long gone from my body, but it lurks in every dark corner of my mind.|`|lwxbHURYaa	there is a certain link between drug use in your teens and late 20s early 30s depression.

omYoOmSlaa	If your description of the event is honest: see a neurologist. One in 10 people in this world will someday experience a seizure. Some have seizures in withdrawal of medications or alcohol. Some have them with high fevers and illness. Others continue to have seizures. That is when they are considered to have a seizure disorder (or epilepsy, if you prefer that title).<br>  <br>  There are a whole slew of tests which doctors do in order to rule out more serious causes of a person's seizures. Blood tests, CT and MRI, are the usual initial tests in the moment. From there, they'll set up appointment for an EEG. They may or may not ask you to become sleep-deprived, in hopes of seeing seizure activity. <br>  <br>  At that point, the neuro may decide to look further to provide an accurate diagnosis. Video EEG may be done to see if the patient is experiencing psychological or physiological seizures. That info will give the doctors the info needed to recommend whatever treatement they deem necessary for you.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Alcohol withdrawal causes seizures. If you quit drinking you should be fine.

z5JkgFOyaa	Severe period pains should always be investigated to check for a treatable cause. As a rough guide, if you've had severe period pain (known as dysmenorrhoea) since around the time your periods first started, it's less likely a particular cause will be found. <br>  <br>  There are exceptions to this. Conditions such as endometriosis can sometimes cause severe pain from an early age (although the pain typically gets worse as the disease does more damage with each monthly cycle). Other causes include fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease and sometimes a narrowing of the cervix. Bear in mind, though, that period pains are rarely a sign of disease, especially in younger women.<br>  <br>  If the pain interferes with your life, preventing you from working, going to school or coping with daily tasks, I would recommend you consult with a doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	All of the above, and drink hot tea.

It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining. They help to stimulate contractions that move menstrual blood out of the uterus, and are also responsible for those cramps that occur throughout your period."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Primary Menstrual Cramps can be a debilitating problem for some 10% of women. Conventional treatment can even be as drastic as exploratory surgery whilst looking for a cure. A less intrusive solution is available. Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible. In order to do this one simply has to clench and then relax the vagina repeatedly for five minutes. With this method no one need know of the discomfort being suffered, and the pain soon goes. "<br>  <br>  <a href="http://organizedwisdom.com/Masturbation_and_Menstrual_Cramps" rel="nofollow">http://organizedwisdom.com/Masturbation_...</a><br>  <br>  "The flexing and contracting of an orgasm basically relieves the cramp.  Reduces the intensity of the cramps.  Also eases some of the other symptoms of premenstrual syndrome."<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  There's no such thing as "being too young" for that.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.

I am 1/2 smaller than you and compared to other guys I feel small.|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Here's the deal Dylan,<br>  <br>  Girls are notoruiously bad at estimating penis size. Most of them overguess meaning that they tend to think they are much larger than they really are. Whatever size your penis is, in the absense of a ruler and tape measure the average girl will estimate it to be about 1 1/2 - 2 inches longer. So even though you have 6 1/2 inches (which is slightly above average anyway), she saw an 8 inch penis. And her friends probably did the same thing with all of their boyfriends penises too (which is why they all seem to have 8-9 inches). <br>  <br>  It's highly unlikely that even one of you  has 8 inches since average penis size for the adult male is about 5 1/2 inches. Since girls tend to overestimate penis sizes, and guys tend to exaggerate the size of their own penis (or just flat out lie) when asked, everyone thinks that most guys have over 6 inches and every guy thinks that he has a small penis when most likely he is average. It's really kind of silly when you think about it but it's true. Your penis size is nothing to be worried about and most likely comparable with those other guys.<br>  <br>  Take it from me, when I was like 15-16 years old I used to lie about my penis size. Even though my penis is 7 inches long (which is already above average) I would tell everyone that it was 8 inches long because I thought that anything less would seem small to people. I didn't know average size was less than 6 and I hadn't seen many other guys naked before so I couldn't really compare. Only when I started reading statistics on average penis size, getting reactions from girls (who thought I was like 8 or 9 inches) and when I started seeing more guys penises in real life that I realized that I was normal and if anything bigger than a lot that I didn't have to BS my penis size anymore. Basically, I grew up!|`|SS5py9jIaa	Well she was being mean and she is a scaggy ho.

jOM4bBMPaa	Even though it's not making you fat, fast food lacks a lot of nutritional value so you may become vitamin deficient.  Moderation is the key to all food, and if you can balance the fast food with a good amount of fruits & veggies you should be okay.|`|AA12103453	NO it isn't ok. Sure you aren't going to gain weight, according to you, BUT you are still going to clog up your arteries. You are begging for heart problems depending on how much you eat. You have to consider that weight just compounds problems, it isn't the real issue.|`|S7GqsRWDaa	Why not eat healthy foods instead?  If you do what you said, the only thing you will gain, if anything, is fat.  If you weight train and eat a lot, but healthy foods, you will gain muscle mass, which looks better and is healthier.  The decision is up to you though, fast food is cheaper, but it is also not healthy, especially 6 times a week.|`|D9zB8suoaa	Whether or not your metabolism is high, its not good to have a high trans fat diet, even if you don't gain weight because it increases chances of coronary heart disease and its lowering good cholesterol (HDL) and increasing bad cholesterol (LDL), and known to have no known benefit, just increases heart problems.|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	You're metabolism will start slowing down now that you're 30.  But I suggest not to eat it 6 days a week.  Maybe once.  I'm 30 also and I used to eat all kinds of junk and wouldn't gain a single pound, but lately if I don't watch what I eat, I start getting rollies on my stomach.|`|3ERx4opSaa	its not all about calories dont forget, those foods contain trans fats, and saturated fats that build up around your belly.
50WCN0graa	In my expereince, they clear up the symptoms right away. Personally, I would start another one now.... maybe  one of the 7 days packs (annoying as they are).<br>  <br>  You can also get a pill from your doctor.... 1 pill, clears it right up.
KKdUWNY3aa	I've been on it for a few months. i LOVE it. :)<br>  <br>  I'm not on it for birth control, since i'm not sexually active. initially I got it to control mood swings, discharge, and irregularity. (sorry bout the details) it hasn't helped with the discharge but the regularity is super nice, I always know EXACTLY when i'm going to get my period, and it usually only lasts a few days, if that. <br>  It's helped a ton with the mood swings. Sometimes the mood swings are there like if I miss a pill, or on the placebo. But usually not too bad.<br>  I haven't noticed much about my weight. it's been pretty constant since i started i guess, and any changes have other sources to blame :P<br>  as for the sex drive, i've never really been into anything like that, so i couldn't tell you.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.
PnlgLBcwaa	yes<br>  <br>  but since tehy are both hard to diagnose and have very similar symptoms--many docs just automatically diagnose both<br>  <br>  there is even a possibility that they are the same condition--just with a variation of the primary condition--like Type 1 and Type 2 (like ADD is a variation of ADHD)<br>  <br>  did you fully examine your lifestyle--i assume you had a sleep study-have you been screened for depression--so you have otehr symptoms (there is more than fatigue to CFIDS)<br>  <br>  <br>  you CAN have FMS without CFIDS--a small number of people with FMS do NOT have fatigue--there is some evidence that there is a problem with REM seep and FMS--but nothing conclusive---<br>  <br>  and just because you have chronic fatigue as a result of FMS---doesn't mena you have CFIDS|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	you can have cronic fatige without fibro but not fobro without the cronic fatigue because if you have fibro you have less REM sleep.
ReNmXYiKaa	wow that is a lot.  I am on a crew team and when I first started I ran about 3-4 mi. and did some kind of ab work out and push ups.  That was for about 2 hours a day 5 times a week.  I lost about 19 lbs. in 1 1/2 months.  <br>  <br>  So with you it depends how much you are pushing yourself on everything, and what you are eating.  There is a guy on the team who is extremely overweight, and he works very hard during practice, but he eats soo much. so if you eat a lot you will not get anywhere.  Don't try and diet, just limit the amount of food that you do eat, which is what I did.<br>  <br>  So with all of the work you are putting in, and expecting that you will limit your food intake, I would say that you could loose about 10-15 lbs a month which is quite a lot. This also may vary on your current weight and, health.<br>  <br>  Take a picture before and after, that makes me feel really good about myself.|`|7PS3fSSPaa	Dude that's way to much cardio. You should do, at the most, an hour of cardio a day and there is no real way to tell how much weight you will loose it depends on metabolism and how you eat and age. Older people take longer to loose weight. People with slow metabolism tend to loose Weight slow because there bodies hold "waste food" for far too long and if you run for an hour then load on a bunch on carbs and fats at the end of the day, you wont loose. <br>  <br>  Now what you should do is run for 30-45 min and do some light weightlifting with alot of repetition. Eat  high protein with low carb and fat food for meals. and snack with vegetables and fruits that contain alot of citruit acids which help burn fat. Eat a high protein snack or maybe just a vegatable 2-3 hours after a meal then another 2-3 hours later eat another meal. That will build metabolism. But the important break down is to eat healthy and not in huge portions and execise continuosly.|`|9439fde5de5d1630388ac3bb49e66ce6aa	is this all in one day?? you really only need 30 minutes of cardio a day and no more than 60 or else your body will get tired and won burn any more.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	Absoluteliiiiii nothing!! If you get that precise you'll force yourself to go insane. =P<br>  <br>  Look, don't mind the fine detail. Fall in love with jogging. Spring time's comin up and find the right music to listen too. Get into parkour too! It's fun and free!! =D
RczxgiQaaa	Adding more or less water isn't going to affect how much protein you get from it.  It's just going to make it even thinner than it already is.|`|tIldpr7vaa	yeah add as much water as u want, but not too much otherwise it will taste too watery and gross|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Sure can! Most protein shakes are tough to get down.  However, the taste might worsen...<br>  <br>  Certain products have additives that "travel" with the water throughout the body.  SO make sure you aren't just flushing out these special additives (if the product contains them) by drinking too much water.  Creatine is a major one...|`|GtAncfOvaa	the water or milk is to just mix the powder so you can drink it, you could use a gallon of water if you really want to...<br>  <br>  milk will change the macronutrient profile of the drink but I'm guessing ur just starting out so I wouldn't worry too much.<br>  <br>  30 grams of protein is 30 grams no matter if you mix it with no water or a bucket of water.|`|9439fde5de5d1630388ac3bb49e66ce6aa	whats the difference if you made he drink following the directions exactly and the having a glass of milk or water afterwards?  theres no difference.  youll get the same amt. of protein.  just more fluids
Fu5oN8yoaa	you might be having rhinitis. it's unusual for a person to have runny nose when exercising because your body is in a sympathomimetic effect when exercising. So i suspect you're having rhinitis. and it is somehow hereditary.

ZQrPoHjTaa	Too many variables, but overall no for most circumstances. First, your body will get used to this and gains will dry up. You didnt state if you are looking for mass? cuts? strength? Mass: it is imperative to make strength gains to add mass. Pyramid bench pressing is best, simple 1 to 2 pound gains is best a week. Cuts: go for higher reps, lower weight, anywhere between 12 to 20 reps. Always practice good form and always warm up. I would also variate your workout, you can get away with 4 ot 6 sets of bench, 8 sets is overkill. Try 4 sets of bench and 4 sets of incline bench or flys. Good Luck!
jw6Lpt37aa	this is an excellent workout if you really stick to that you will not need any thing more the usual time for an adult person to workout per day is 30 minute and you do more than that and if you count the daily routine then you will find yourself doing a lot of workout and that with some adjustment in the daily intake of food you will get the best result ever and your body will get firmed and toned in a very short time and always keep in mind to change your routine by doing the opposite like workout with the medicine ball first and then run  best of luck and enjoy your life and keep on|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You have not mentioned your goal. It will be difficult to prescribe the workout Schedule.|`|nnaqMgYRaa	it's somewhat okay, but if you divide, you should add a little extra, like instead of 20 minutes, try 25 or 30.
RKMgokm6aa	Alright, during anaerobic exercise, the muscles use ATP and creatine for fuel. In essence, creatine supplementation causes the body to store more creatine, and therefore increase strength, endurance, and recovery during such exercise. Also, it seems that creatine helps a bit of water into the muscles. Muscle tissue is largely comprised of water, and you can see why that would be a good thing. It will definitely help in tennis conditioning. Also, I highly suggest you take some multi vitamins as well as supplement with some whey protein. These will certainly help you out. <br>  <br>  To address some of your question, creatine is a natural substance and is already in your body. It is non hormonal and will not induce you to take on any masculine characteristics. Good luck on your quest for better health.|`|tIldpr7vaa	creatine isnt steroids, its not hormonal and wont make u manish. Its just to help build muscles and help with muscle recovery, u can buy it at any kind of  health/vitamin shop. How much depends on the brand, but its not very expensive|`|rSwce38saa	all i can say is, it works :)|`|ROWNVIUVaa	Others have covered the how it works and what it is part, so let me just skip to some advice. I played 4 years of varsity tennis in high school and 2 years in college. Tennis isn't a game about being "buff" or even big. In fact, it's more about being lean and fast. Having a lot of muscle weight to lug around the court will only serve to tire you out. Also, hitting the ball hard isn't about swinging ridiculously hard, but about hitting the ball properly and with good form.  Instead of trying to gain muscle, you should work on light weightlifting to tone what you have, and lots of cardio to keep your stamina up so you don't tire out during the game. All the muscle in the world won't help you if you can't run to the ball.
QUmNt2WAaa	Well it all depends on the activities you do and your eating habits.. If your really tall its somewhat normal to be "small" And i weigh 93 pounds and im very flat.. :l But Dont let it get you down just remember girls with big boobs have back aches and are more likely to have spinal issues :D <br>  Lol sorry. anyway.. If you really would like to be "bigger" i would suggest like over the summer (so it wont seem obvious) Get padded bras Like at victorias secret  Its a little pricey but?

I use Dove's extra rich moisturizing soap.  It comes in a maroon bottle.  I scrub with one of those nylon net poufy things.

8lYZROjuaa	If your bikini bottom was damp and the weather was warm, yes you can obtain a yeasto from that.  <br>  Occasionally yeast infections go away on their own, not normally.  There are a bunch of over the counter remedies to buy for that.  <br>  Having sex can actually spread the infection to your partner.  May as well take care of it with an OTC product just in case it becomes worse.
sQu3LLqtaa	Girls usually stop growing at 15 so you may have reached your peak height already.  Further growth after 15 is possible but uncertain.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	You are already above the average.

If you've only had sex 4 months ago and had been impregnated, you should've skipped not only this month, but the past 4 months, right? So that's not possible. And menopause is also not possible, you are entirely much too young.<br>  <br>  In any case, you should see a doctor, specifically an ob/gyn if you have one. Skipping cycles isn't too much of a serious deal, unless it happens frequently and/or consecutively. Good luck.
WZkFdbnKaa	eh I'd say half.. I'm not expert... ur upper body weighs a lot more then bottom half so roughly 40-60% put your feet on bed n try. try onehand with feet about a foot apart but like on the sides just get comfortable any way you do it. then hardest. one hand with feet spred pretty far apart..|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Anywhere from 40%-100%, depending on how you do them.
xsyAljhaaa	It's not about how much you weigh, it's how much body fat you have. 7% is average. You can use the BMI (body mass index) calculators online to see where you should be at for a sedentary person. BMI fails miserably for athletes and strength athletes in particular. I'm 5'9" and weigh 220 with low body fat, but for someone else 170 might be best. For me the best weight is 242, but that's my preference. Don't worry about weight, and get a skin-fold caliper to judge how much fat you have.

RczxgiQaaa	Stretch, lift, run.  But don't run more than 20-30 minutes after lifting.  Your body gets more benefit from weight training than it does cardio, so you don't want to be tired when you start.<br>  <br>  You should be fairly burnt from just the weights and you're body is going to continue burning calories for many hours after you've finished.

DwkO4Y9uaa	drink water, or eat watermelon.
xsyAljhaaa	Um...you left out some pertinent information like age, weight, height, body fat levels...<br>  Maybe you gained that 10 lbs. because you are already way underweight, and if I ate what you've eaten so far today in one sitting, I'd still be hungry. I see a real problem with your diet, unless you are eating a lot of tofu: Where is the protein??? Not all weight is bad. Muscle weighs more than fat and is metabolically active, so if you don't eat any, or hardly any protein you are cannibalizing your muscles, effectively lowering your metabolism. It's not a sustainable diet if there is not a proper balance of nutrients. I'm no fan of vegetarianism, and soy protein is not a very good source, neither is bean protein because they have an incomplete amino acid profile. You also need cholesterol to build cell membranes and to make sex hormones. People who get 0 cholesterol have a nasty habit of going insane -- no exaggeration -- this is one of the side effects.<br>  Anyway, you probably put on fat due to undereating. Get a healthy diet which fulfills your bodies nutritional and caloric requisites, and exercise intelligently and you will look good. Don't pay attention to the weight on the scale, it's almost meaningless. Use a mirror to judge your fat levels -- unless you have an eating disorder.|`|00lbIaqcaa	hi there. i would suggest the nutritional shake my friends and i are enjoying. it has helped us lose weight the safe, effective and healthy way. no medicine, but only food. it has helped us lose those excess pounds and now we can eat what we wish without fear of gaining those extra weight.   very convenient if you concern is your school load. i my self am quite busy but the shake has provided me with my needed nutrients during my busy days, most of all, i lost weight. my migraine and acidity was also relieved. hope to be of help to you on this. thanks
tMtBe1lKaa	cover up might help. I don't want you to hurt yourself, but you could rasp them a bit on the pavement and say you fell. That would cover them up for a while.

First work on your diet. Cut out the unhealthy food and replace it with better versions. Also cutting back on your carbs can really help your initial weight loss. <br>  (Ex: use whole wheat bread and pastas, natural granola bars, juices instead of sodas etc...)<br>  <br>  You'll also need to exercise.

L4YGtpeLaa	Cutting is a coping skill (not a good one however). It takes the mind off mental pain. Overly simplified- like stubbing a toe will make a person forget a headache for a bit.<br>  <br>  I would tell your counselor. Counselors only have to tell if 1) you are going to kill yourself (cutting superficially doesn't count), 2) someone is abusing you, 3) you are going to kill someone.<br>  <br>  I have several cutters on my caseload (I am a counselor) and I did not tell their parents. Counselors can't help what you don't tell them.<br>  <br>  Might ask your counselor to explain to you again what he/she has to tell your parents if it truly worries you.|`|38be92b202d3bb88fe3754d7ae6e8ac2aa	I think you need to tell your counselor.<br>  Isn't it all confidential?

When I relapsed last week I couldn't find any scissors in the house so I broke apart one of my razors yes I was sadly that desperate too cut. Theres NOTHING wrong with you I totally understand cutting is a coping mechanism. Please go talk to your counselor you don't want to relapse I know I had said two years ago to a friend that I was never going to do it again and I relapsed. You did the smart thing in the beginning you talked to a counselor I never did that nor told my parents only a friend whom I trustedthat'ss why my cutting turned into a full blown addiction.

AA11944397	I've been on a few different birth control pills in my life, and yes-they do affect your period.  The first one I was on made me spot for the first two weeks I was on it.  And the second one I was on, I didn't get my period until well into the second pack of pills.  It is definitely a common side effect of birth control pills-it all depends on how your body responds to the change in hormone levels. <br>  And a week is more than enough time for your body to begin responding to the change in hormone levels.  <br>  You really have nothing to worry about.  You shouldn't get your period until the week of 'sugar' pills, which is the last week of pills in every monthly pack-and like I said, you may not for the first couple of months-your period might be irregular for a little bit-but once your body gets used to the medicine, things will regulate and go back to normal.  Nothing to worry about!|`|t2VxOwfDaa	My ex-gf specifically got on the pill to reduce her periods.  So yes, its possible but I don't think its common with all forms of contraceptive.  Talk to your doctor about it if its bugging you and switch pills.|`|PyjZVn28aa	your body will take a pack or two to get used to the pills...you will not get your period after a week of taking the pills...you have to go through the whole pack first before getting it..the pills screw up your system..so your body must get used to a new routine...dont expect to get your period a week after you start the pills..cause i doubt it wll happen|`|D8gqf4Dsaa	Well I'm not really sure unless I'm reading your question wrong, if you just started taking your pill a week ago you shouldn't be starting your period yet. You should have started your pack, then there should be three weeks you take the pill then on the 4th week you take your sugar pills and that is when you start your period. But in any case yes when you start using the pill it can make your period very light or you may even skip a period, but if you are only using the pill and no other contraceptives (condoms) you should wait till you have been on the pill for at least a month or u can still get pregnant. Good luck.

sTdlAMv7aa	The other respondent described doing lateral shoulder raises.  These help with the side of the shoulder, but there are other exercises one should do to have balanced shoulder strength (& make the shoulders broader).  Those exercises include 1) military presses, which start at the shoulders & end above the head, then repeat for reps (can be done with a barbell or dumbbells), & 2) upright rows (using light weights with good form).  Military presses are not the same as behind the neck presses (bnp)- bnps can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome (as can upright rows when using too much weight).<br>  <br>  Certain compound exercises (not isolated to the shoulders) can also help with gaining shoulder breadth.  Chest exercises that can help broaden the shoulders include bench presses (incline, decline, flat bench), flies, etc.  Back exercises that can help broaden the shoulders include lateral rows, t-bar, pull ups/chin ups, lat pulldown, rowing machine, etc.|`|fhCR7Fu1aa	I forget what they are specifically called. but take dumbells with your arms down at your waist on either side, and raise your arms straight out horizontally.

z5JkgFOyaa	No, I have never had a skin tag on my vagina or anywhere near my vagina.<br>  <br>  I have had a number of bilateral ovarian cysts (which included functional, hemorrhagic and endometrioma cysts) over the past 11 years.

I have experienced the same type of pain whenever I have had an ovarian cyst.<br>  <br>  I recommend that if you have any concerns regarding this pain you are experiencing, that you consult with your doctor/gyno for further evaluation. Sometimes ovarian cysts can become large and can twist or rupture causing intense pain and sometimes turning into an emergency.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
v0l1JEloaa	Well, you can start by eating the entire Egg!  The actual egg is the yoke: the thin liquid whites are just to keep the yoke from busting.  Then you also want to start eating lots of beef, because it has zinc, iron, and it's also high protein, which is what your body needs to make more muscle.  I don't mean that you should stock up on bologna, I mean eat hamburger meat and steaks.  <br>  Eat whole wheat bread instead of oatmeal, because it's better for you.  Spinach is high in iron as well as a good source of vitamin C and E, so make sure to eat that on a regular basis.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	1.  The device goes to 360 cause there are 360 degrees in a circle.  Not to mention it has to be high enough so no one reaches it.  I've personally had patients with systolic pressures in the high 200's.  <br>  <br>  2.  It means your screwed.  If the pulse pressure is genuinely low, e.g. 25 mmHg or less, the cause may be low stroke volume, as in Congestive Heart Failure and/or shock, a serious issue. This interpretation is reinforced if the resting heart rate is relatively rapid, e.g. 100-120, reflecting increased sympathetic nervous system activity as the body's response to low stroke volume and low cardiac output. A narrow pulse pressure can also be caused by aortic stenosis.  My personal fav is cardiac tamponade which basically means the lights are on but nobodies home.  What happens there is the AV Node continues to fire but because of the pressure around the heart the heart literally can't and won't beat till the pressure is relieved.      <br>  <br>  2.  Part 2 If the usual resting pulse pressure is consistently greater than 40 mmHg, e.g. 60 or 80 mmHg, the most likely basis is stiffness of the major arteries, aortic regurgitation, arteriovenous malformation, hyperthyroidism or some combination. (A chronically increased stroke volume is also a technical possibility, but very rare in practice.) While some drugs for hypertension have the side effect of increasing resting pulse pressure irreversibly, other hypertension drugs, such as ACE Inhibitors, have been shown to lower pulse pressure. A high resting pulse pressure is harmful and tends to accelerate the normal aging of body organs, particularly the heart, the brain and kidneys. A high pulse pressure combined with bradycardia is associated with increased intracranial pressure.|`|GiONso7zaa	Well, to answer your 1st question, they meters measure very high so that if there were to be a case where somebody had a blood pressure exceeding 360 systolic, we could know about it.<br>  <br>  167 systolic is something to be worried about. If you're reading 167/162 then you might want to see a doctor because 162 diastolic is very high is considered stage 2 hypertension <br>  <br>  If you measure your BP different on your left and right hands then you are most likely not getting accurate readings.|`|H2ujc4Gvaa	Yes, nor bp is 120/80, but you would be amazed how high some people's bp can get (ie. adrenal cortex tumor).<br>  When there's a very big difference between the first and the second reading it usually means there's a process of artheriosclerosis (calcification of the arteries). You see, the first reading is an indicaator of the force the heart is beating with and the second of how the arteries in your body are.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

z5JkgFOyaa	Glands inside a girl/woman’s vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when a woman is breastfeeding or when a woman is sexually excited.<br>  <br>  Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem.  Some other types of infections such as yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis can also cause discharge that is usually accompanied by odor such as beer/yeast/fish.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you have any of these signs or any concerns regarding this you consult with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and for proper treatment should you have anything other than just a normal vaginal discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|g5zSRCGQaa	Everyone has a bit of discharge.  The vagina is a self cleaning organ.  Normal discharge is like egg whites and gets thicker when you are ovulating.  Having said that if it is clumpy and smells kind of fishy or like bread dough, you may have a yeast infection.|`|QUmNt2WAaa	Really well if this helps your not alone? I have this most of the time..And discharge is normal but i have the odor problem too...Its been on my mind too|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	No, you don't have a yeast infection.  Discharge is completely normal and is the body's way of cleaning the vagina.  If you had yeast, you would have itching and redness.<br>  <br>  best wishes..
KAuPPyxDaa	There's a time in life where the body change. People can once be immune to it whereas later in life, the food is really harm to them. It's mostly passed down from genetics. There isn't really an explanation for this devastating catastrophe.|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	Yeah, don't even listen to the guy above me.  Wow.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can lose or gain an allergy to anything at any point in your life.  There are numerous proteins in all nuts.  One key distinction with almonds is that they are not actually nuts... they are seeds.  The almond comes from fruit, like the coffee "bean".<br>  <br>  If you are allergic to a protein common to all nuts, then you may not be allergic to almonds since they are not a nut.  You may not be allergic to pistachios or coconuts either, which are not nuts, but drupes, as well.

SwNKHxNQaa	Do crunches, sit ups, and other ab work outs. However if you do not do cardio you will have steel abs but your fat would still be covering it. Essentially be "thick" in shape but "thick" I suggest running a mile a day. It is good cardio and if your doing it on the treadmill at a rate of like 4.5-5.0 its legimately only 15 minutes of running. so thats about like 3-4 songs on your ipod.

dpgXzMenaa	You were just getting close, but you didn't get there if that's all you felt.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm.  Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know what one is and how to have one, for sure.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|c42a426f28c9fd509f9cc8dd1cb7d303aa	what you felt was not an orgasm, mostly because you said you couldn't keep still after wards! when a women reaches an orgasm its the best feeling ever, but usually in masturbation it goes away for about 2 secs which is normal, but after wards most women lose the "horny" feeling like your satisfied. you said you couldn't stay still so you were just reaching an orgasm, what you do is you keep going until you come, and trust me you will know! and then it usually feels a bit sore after wards!!<br>  <br>  <br>  but trust me you will know when you reach one!!|`|390032981173faf9118ec2e5f2f30349aa	leading up to one.|`|jJjfeylmaa	thaaat would def just be leading up to one :) the actual orgasm is hard to describe.. you like get tense and lose feeling/control in a way? and then you like come back down? idk its hard to explain. it does feel great tho :)|`|526ecb0ada8ac2e5c1f389c6b5600112aa	Yes is a orgasm|`|qDGfoqW0aa	That was a orgasm, good job!

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

You just need to eat smart, that means eating most what you like but like most ppl they do that in excess.  Carbs are full of sugars that take longer to break down in your body, although necessary for energy don't go overboard.  Proteins are ok, you can eat more of them but again not in excess.  Vegetables and fruits are your friends.  Most importantly is exercise, whether it's walking, short jogs and find a good gym or even a nearby rec center.  Logically stay away from junk food and avoid eating later at night.  You can splurge occasionally, but never more than about about a 24hr period and that is not very often.  Losing weight is about eating smart and exercise not fade diets. Statistics show most people who go on diets end up gaing the weight right back right after they reach their goal weight and then stop thinking they are safe.

There is some evidence that hanging weights from the penis can cause a long term restriction of blood circulation to the glands of the penis. This can cause infection or even gangrene in serious cases, which would ultimately lead to amputation. <br>  <br>  The most effective and safest way to get a bigger penis is with penis enlargement exercises. The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is. The effects are permanent, so any you keep any gains in size - even after you stop doing the exercises.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.|`|Fmeiu9PVaa	I don't know, having never tried it, but I can tell you one thing: your penis needs to last you for a lifetime, so please treat it kindly.|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	The 2nd part of you question makes me think you might have actually tried this.<br>  <br>  <br>  That thought makes me laugh.|`|ymMa6Pmiaa	Another lost Chris,<br>  <br>  Anyway dude, that's totally FALSE.

kXq90b09aa	Yes you will lose lean muscle as the 800 calories, as you know, is not even closely sufficient for your body to function, so all the calories you eat will be used up for different metabolic functions,  and end of the day the body would have nothing left to replenish your muscles. Doing strength training, or any other exercising would increase your metabolism thus you burn more calories, leaving your body with hardly anything for daily functions! <br>  <br>  Best form of diets are to eat within your calorie limit for a day, you can eat anything, eat a lot of proteins along with carbs, fats and other nutrition but do not exceed you calorie limit, and you wont gain any. Assuming you require more than 2200 calories a day (being an athlete) you can easily cut down like 800 calories a day, this way you can lose around 2 pounds a week. (every 3500 calories is 1 pound)<br>  <br>  More, am sure you'd have read how damaging it is for our kidneys if we take too much of proteins and not take other necessary like good carbs, good fats, fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

AyP3KlKdaa	Fossil fuels are petroleum, gasoline, diesel, natural gas, coal, etc.  Since these do not completely burn, there are by-products that contribute to pollution, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and various hydrocarbons.<br>  Carbon monoxide is poisonous, and nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides combine with water vapor in the air to form nitric and sulfuric acids (components of acid rain).  Diesel and coal can spew out black smoke of hydrocarbons that can cause respiratory problems.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	The emissions contain CO2 which go up into the atmosphere and get stuck there with the natural layer of CO2 (greenhouse gas) which then helps keep some of the sun's heat inside our atmosphere. Which is why we basically don't freeze to death at night. If that layer gets too thick less heat will escape back into space and eventually we get warmer.

TsjqzanQaa	Masturbation feels best when the foreskin is moved up and down over the glans, that's one of the many benefits of having a foreskin.<br>  <br>  Later on, though, when you have sex, you'll probably enjoy it more when the foreskin has more movement and can be retracted.<br>  <br>  You are in the majority, by the way, 80% of the men in the world are uncircumcised, and that's the natural and normal state of a man.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is an abnormal and unnatural mutilation of the penis, which always damages it, and also destroys sexual sensitivity and ability.<br>  <br>  When you expose the glans, it will be hypersensitive, and the hypersensitivity will diminish in time, if you expose it for 5-10 minutes at a time, several times per day.<br>  <br>  Don't leave the foreskin pulled back for extended periods, as it can cause swelling and pain.<br>  <br>  Can you retract the foreskin when you're flaccid?<br>  <br>  You can gently and gradually stretch the foreskin opening wider to accomodate full retraction when erect, but it must be done gently, and over several months, at least, so as not to cause scarring and tearing of the tissues.<br>  <br>  Just stretch the opening wider daily, just use enough force to feel moderate discomfort, not pain.<br>  <br>  An uncircumcised penis with a foreskin is a complete penis.<br>  <br>  A circumcised penis is a partial penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|Qas05nZraa	get circumcised and it's normal|`|i6RlYFo7aa	yes, it is supposed to retract (and you're not different, you're normal, 85% of men have foreskin)<br>  <br>  stretch the skin (look up foreskin stretching excercises) and get a steroid cream so the skin loosens up<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  oh and uncircumcised is the way to go : )<br>  <br>  circumcised weeners are dry and scarred up, mutilation isn't cool, circumcision has no benefits <br>  <br>  so it's funny that those rude people think they're cool to have a cut up, dry, partial, scarred, botched penis LOL sucks for them|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It is supposed to be able to retract so you can clean it but it doesn't have to expose the whole head during masturbation, if that's what you meant.

It's better that way for cleaning and sex, but if you don't want to make it like that then you don't have to. <a href="http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tightforeskin" rel="nofollow">http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...</a><br>  <br>  Harriet|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Damn, some of the people who answer questions on here are really f*#king idiots!

You should be able to retract the foreskin, however if it feels tight start by stretching and retracting the skin more and more each day to see if that helps, if not your doctor can prescribe a cream that will help. Be careful though, the head of your penis will most likely be very sensitive, but overtime it will improve.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

FicyC2TXaa	Very few, usually. <br>  <br>  The main side effect people report is fatigue, though not everyone experiences this.<br>  <br>  I I had 25 sessions, and I can't honestly remember how far into it I was when I began to experience fatigue. It wasn't constant, just every few days I felt exhausted - suddenly tired as if a plug had been pulled and my energy drained away. I made sure I went for a walk every day - many people find gentle exercise helps with fatigue.<br>  <br>  I did continue to feel tired for a few months after treatment, but honestly I put this down to the treatment in its entirety - surgery and anaesthetic, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, rather than just the rads.<br>  <br>  I didn't burn - my skin was slightly pink by the end of my 25 sessions; this too, of course, varies from person to person and for some people it's more like severe sun burn. <br>  <br>  I'm not aware of any other side effects - I didn't have any and none of the women I've spoken to about it in breast cancer support networks have mentioned any.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Fatigue and hair loss are the main ones.

The only side effects of radiation to the breast would be turning the skin a dark color and making it very tender.|`|176FjzuCaa	Hello.  Well first, I hope this is only for informational purposes.  I would always recommend people speak to their Radiation Oncologist for a specific and "tailored-to-you" kind of answer to this question.  This particular reply/answer will be only discussing the treatment of an "intact" breast or non-mastectomy...in other words, you still have your breast (with or without lumpectomy).  <br>  <br>  In general, side effects are determined, in part by which side we are talking about, as the risk, be-it small, is present for heart related damage if we are talking about left sided breast cancer.  Now it is/should be a part of most practices that every effort is made to shield the heart and as much of the normal lung tissue as possible, however normal tissue is going to be afffected by the radiation fields.  <br>  <br>  The most common side effects include redness and a fullness feeling of the breast, accompanied by some tenderness.  These generally do not present themselves until about the 2nd to 3rd weeeks of the initial 5 week course.  Patients also commonly experience fatigue with their treatments.  Less common side effects to the radiation treatments are telangiectasia, radiation-induced pneumonitis, and secondary malignancy (like 1% risk).  <br>  <br>  All of the more common side effects are manageable and there are some things you can do to help yourself combat these.  1) Forget about the anti-perspirant on the affected side...use a cornstarch or cornstarch based product if you are concerned with underarm moisture...but nothing with metallic elements (like the common over the counter deodorants/anti-perspirants).  2) Keep the exposed treatment area away from direct sunlight or tanning beds.  If your skin begins to get "warm" use a 100% aloe gel (nothing that 10% aloe and 90% junk...stick with the 100% stuff).  It may even help to put it in the fridge to assist in the "cooling" effect.  3) I would also recommend you stay clear of the hot tub scene for a while, if you are into that. Bottom line: if you try any products for your skin, please make sure they are completely removed by the time you get on the treatment table...even the best things can do more harm than good if they are present on your skin during the treatment...but, if you wish, go hog-wild in the changing room afterwards...no consequence at that point! <br>  <br>  Again, if this is for you or a loved one, please seek the counsel of your/their Radiation Oncologist as there are way too many factors affecting the incidence of side effects (chemo, previous treatments, current medications (prescribed and non-), etc., etc. with all of the information of your clinical case coupled with your history and lifestyle, they will best be able to provide the reasonable side-effect profile, and hopefully, ease any nerves about the process!  <br>  <br>  Above all; Take care!!!!|`|DgUq78nQaa	Radiation turns the skin a red color like a sun burn.  It will get tender, and feel just like a sun burn.  Your throat will hurt up intil about 3 weeks after radiation has stopped.  <br>  <br>  You will feel tired and might get weak.  <br>  <br>  Those are the only side affects|`|HumMEMu5aa	Everyone's side effects from radiation are different, but most common are fatigue and burns.<br>  <br>  For some reason many hospitals don't recommend products that help with burns.

Abs only show when your body fat percentage is less than 8% or something like that.<br>  <br>  Therefore, more ab workouts will not help!  You want to lower the amount of fat!

If that's a little too weird, try a sweatband. <br>  If anyone asks, say it's the latest style or you have a case of poison oak and you don't want to scratch it. I've used those ones a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|6wjR1rAGaa	I've found that generally, unless people will be looking directly at your arms you can still cover it up with makeup, even if it's still a little visible and as long as you don't expose your arm too much (no raising your hands in the sunlight w/ everyone watching and try to keep you arms generally turned inward) no one will really notice. Just be sure to put some of that liquid bandage stuff on first so that it doesn't get infected. <br>  If you don't have any other cuts or scars on your arm, you can always make a really big deal about it and whine about how some *** in the hallway accidentally scratched you with an exacto blade coming out of the art room. There are a million excuses that you can give. Say your friend pushed you into a fence or you fell into a thorn bush, etc. The cat scratch excuse is sort of like saying the dog ate your homework. I wouldn't recommend using it unless you have a really good and complicated story to back it up-- simply saying that your cat scratched you isn't going to cut it. Make up some ridiculous story so that it doesn't sound too manufactured. <br>  What do your cuts look like?  If they're all in a neat row, then you should make an excuse about something like a fork, rake, fence, etc. Anything that could give you scratches like that. If they're all jagged and going in multiple directions you should probably lean more towards the falling in a thorn bush type of lie.<br>  <br>  You could also always fake sick or skip that period. Maybe five minutes before the bell rings for your gym period ask your teacher to go to the nurse. If they send you back before gym class is over, just skip the rest of the period and if the school calls your house you can explain to your parents that you were at the nurse.|`|L1QDGBK4aa	"accidentally" rip or tear a whole in the front of your shirt when you supposed to be changing.

AA11311516	I use to do this to, let him know you fall asleep that early so try watching them earlier!|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Don't mean to be sexist, but it seems like girls on average get tired early easier than guys.  Just look at all the comments here!  Most girls I know say they go to sleep at around 9-10, and most guys from 12-1.  Also, I noticed girls get addicted to caffeine easier.  Sorry to sound completely sexist, and I know that this isn't true for every girl and every guy, but these are just my observations.  I don't know what you can do about it since I'm not a girl and don't have this problem, except in the morning.  I can't wake up then.  Not being able to wake up in the morning seems more common with guys.<br>  <br>  It probably comes down to evolutionary tendencies.  Males had to stay up later to defend from a nighttime attack by another animal, and women had to get up earlier to care for babies.  So maybe just try caffeine or watching your movies earlier.|`|rFUPo4YDaa	Wow, I thought I was the only one. lol.<br>  Try drinking a red bull or try watching a movie a lil earlier around 8. <br>  That's the only thing that has worked for me.|`|Qdb5LZMCaa	this must be more common than I thought lol...

OzK10hKxaa	That depends what kind of vegetarian you are. Do you consume animal products such as milk? or are you totally against anything connected to animals? <br>  <br>  Most protein powder is whey, it is derived from milk. Moo.<br>  <br>  Soya protein is vegetarian friendly, from non other than.. soya beans!<br>  It is usually really cheap too. But then, whey protein is a superior protein compared to soya. It is a pretty poor protein as to how your body uses it.  <br>  <br>  You can get along fine in everyday life with just vegetarian sources of protein, but for working out, bodybuilding etc. I do believe it will be harder due to the increase of protein that you need.<br>  <br>  But there are lots of vegetarian sources of protein such as...<br>  <br>  Tofu, almonds, peanut butter, broccoli! brown rice, baked beans and etc. the list goes on.<br>  <br>  But you will struggle to get like say 40g of protein after a workout using these sources.

That’s about 0.36 grams of protein for every pound of body weight. But in fact, protein needs vary depending on age, size, growth, health, physical activity, body type, . For more information on this point, see the articleere are three broad categories: legumes, grains, nuts & seeds. These can be mixed and matched to get complete protein at any meal, or throughout the day. For instance, the amino acids in legumes (beans & lentils) are balanced by those in grains, nuts and seeds, and vice versa. Vegetables and fruits also contribute significant amounts of protein. A one cup serving of avocado, for example, has 3 grams of complete protein, and a medium potato with skin has 4 g.Vegans can't help getting all the essential amino acids, through eating different combinations of grains, legumes, nuts & seeds, vegetables & fruit several times a day. <br>  <br>  Food combining for complete protein isn't a scientific system, where you have to keep track and analyze everything you eat. It's a natural traditional way of eating, which most human beings have eaten and thrived on, for thousands of years. Food is a sensual pleasure, and complete protein is a side benefit.|`|UYvR96tgaa	the best protein after a workout is whey protein. if you can use whey protein isolate, it gets absorbed a lot better than whey protein concentrate. optimum nutrition's 100% whey protein is a solid choice. i'd recommend getting supplements online, its usually A LOT cheaper than at GNC. <br>  <br>  you might also wanna take some fast-digesting carbs with that protein.|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	Protein powder works, but might not be good for u at this age.

i09pUyE4aa	i don't think it is.<br>  it's most likely just insomnia or something, which isn't a mental illness exactly, i also have this problem.<br>  but you can get medicine, it doesn't mean you're mentally ill or anything though, so i don't think you need to worry about it.<br>  but if it's effecting your stamina and endurance through-out the day, i'd say you might want to see a doctor, for like medicine and things.<br>  <br>  some people consider insomnia and things mentally illnesses, but i don't exactly.<br>  <br>  <br>  to be honest though, most people with sleeping problems just have a lot going on in their life, or have unresolved problems and things.|`|t8wtmMYlaa	Well, first you need to stop thinking what it could be and find out why you cant sleep ok,  Suggestion go to the doctor for a sleeping disorder test.  Does not hurt they watch how you sleep with monitors and watch your brain waves. This will show them the reason. It works.  In the mean time if you work leave it at work. Don't bring it home. Read a romantic book, watch a comedy. No drama or thriller,  that will make your mind spin and take longer to relax. Sweet dreams.|`|PRlCQh0zaa	It might be Insomnia|`|RQWyYV6Laa	Yep its true|`|pueeMH6gaa	Yes, and a serious incurable mental illness too.|`|L5I2tXvVaa	no it means that something is bothering you    just take tylenol p.m<br>  that happens to mee all the time|`|EuCF5rp8aa	are you stressed out? that often is a reason for hard sleeping.|`|AA11707163	sounds like your love life is in the dumps !|`|GEsOhS8Paa	it can be you should see a doctor if that is the problem
EJNV1XUNaa	Well it depends on what kind of anemia you have. I'm assuming it's iron-deficiency anemia, but there's also anemia related to a deficiency of vitamin B-12. If you're iron deficient, take an iron supplement (but not with milk, bc the calcium in milk makes it hard for your body to absorb the iron). Also, you can eat a little more red meat and vegetables that contain iron, such as spinach. Grains such as cereals are also fortified with iron. To help your body absorb more of the iron in the non-meat sources, drink a glass of orange juice with it, which is high in vitamin C. The C can help your body absorb it better. Hope that helps!|`|0LxgeSJnaa	You mean you are aneimic?<br>  <br>  Just aak your doctor what you should do. <br>  <br>  I take iron.|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	if it's not severe, just take Iron supplements or eat foods rich in Iron. You won't die any earlier that you would have before.|`|QoOx93PPaa	Lol, you mean that you're anemic.<br>  - You're not going to die from anemia.<br>  - When you were at the doctor, if that's how you found out, you should have asked them.<br>  - Further, they would have told you if you were going to die.<br>  - Further yet, if you didn't find out from a doctor, you may not be anemic.<br>  <br>  You say it's not severe, so chances are it'll just be an annoyance. If it's from a lack of iron, you can simply take some iron pills and that'll help.|`|H2ujc4Gvaa	There are many kinds of anemia (not exclusively caused by lack of iron). So it's important you go yo a doctor so you can find the cause of the anemia.|`|HYZYjV3Qaa	sickle cell anemia?|`|iJ5BgNuBaa	It depends on what is causing your anemia. Most common is iron deficiency anemia - more likely in females than males (because we have periods) . <br>  <br>  Anyway - if it is iron deficiency, you can supplement with ferrous sulfate tablets that your doc can prescribe you. And just because you are anemic doesn't mean you need to take pills - it depends on the severity. <br>  <br>  It is not dangerous to be slightly anemic - you just may feel more fatigued than most people. It is when the H+H drops sooo low that you have additional symptoms and are at risk for more serious complications. <br>  <br>  No worries - just visit your doc regularly and get your blood drawn to keep monitoring the situation. :)|`|3eUf3JBmaa	ur not even close to dying... i'm anemic and all i do is take an iron supplement once a day. it keeps you from feeling sick all the time, and can help if you have anemia related migraines or headaches.|`|JEOAknkfaa	I'm anemic too, and have been all my life.

They are usually on the lip or around the outside of them.  <br>  <br>  With coldsores start out as a little tingle and within a few hours it will start to blister up and start hurting.  If untreated it will usually take 1-2 weeks to completely heal up. <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about.  If you had a herpes blister and bit it, then it will swell up worst and hurt worst.|`|Wcscjegnaa	I'm sure it'll be fine =]<br>  Herpes usually isn't just one bump and you didn't mention any oral sex.|`|973048f8517e0239c85279b6cdd730cbaa	It could be but if it was gone so soon probably not.

dpgXzMenaa	The word is "masturbation"... <br>  <br>  There's no such thing as "being too young" for that.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  I don't think many things *get* more normal than that.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|XVe2Jkbsaa	Do you mean masturbation..?

It can be scary if you are not in tune or used to actually feeling your body. In my opinion this is the only time you really get to feel your body. Anyway it is just your body coming to a fully relaxed state.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Well your alive now, glad to have you back. <br>  <br>  Are you sure you werent just falling down or somthing in your dream?

My drive was slightly less at 36 than it had been, though.  You start caring about other stuff more than sex..... like coffee, sleeping, the stock market, your sky miles, and sailboats.  Sports takes on added significance becaese your team hasnt won in many years.  So for example, he might promise to foresewar sex if the Dodgers win the World Series. But WHEN you screw... its more fun than b4 when you were young.  If your 36 yr old man has a LOW sex drive, there's some plumbing problems maybe.  If he is oversexed, there could be a mental thing going on and you better watch his azz, cuz 36 is also a classic marriage meltdown age.|`|3SwWwR4aaa	I'm 54 and I can still do all I used to but not as often.

We run like a mile every week in our school too, and when I ate vegetables that morning on that day, I didn't get tired more easily than I did before when I didn't eat vegetables. Second, you can start to have goals. Like I want to have 5 minutes at a lap or something and after a week or two, you can make that lap time 4:45. Then yoyu can rewaqrd yourself or something. Or, you and your friend can race and see who wins. The loser can buy you something. hehe. My friend and I did that, but I lost to her. Also, you can run faster if you get behind someone. Because the air pressure when you run makes you tired easier than when there's no wind blowing. Also, you can run everyday after school, or job every morning. That way you can loose wight and can run faster, because the heavier you are, the lower you are at running.

It's childish to be embarrassed about it at your age.|`|EozYN8ynaa	just tell her. it may seem awkward but your mom has been dealing with periods for a long time so its normal to her. best just to get it over with.<br>  i see no reason for your soccer team to need to know about your period. i would have your mom ask the coach/organizers why that information is required or even relevant. if the proper care is taken, your period won't affect you playing at all.|`|ebI6ubrgaa	Just tell her like you got it today, though I think that you should tell her how long you have had it since you will have to tell the truth on that form anyway. Just explain to her that you were really embarassed about it and go from there, it's better to be honest with her about it now then have her question you and lose the trust because she had to find out about it on her own.|`|fac27a894899c379ea9be2f916504240aa	I'm pretty sure she already knows...  It's not something to be embarrassed about.  She had to go through it as well.  Just tell her you already started your period and don't lie.  There is no point.  It's so silly to lie about something like that.  If you lie, she'll probably know you're lying because you're already developed.|`|x4Irx79Gaa	Im sure it wont be that bad,<br>  when i told my mum i was like woaah i cant do this.<br>  but i had to .<br>  and now u do to .<br>  im very close with my mum too<br>  trust me its better use r close so it wont be as awkward as others find it . im sure she will understand|`|dZsaZfVkaa	You're so pretty!<br>  <br>  i'm sure she knows already.|`|0408UUUeaa	iit really wont matter when u tell her <br>  my mother and i are very close,  when i got my period i didnt tell her till i didnt have money for tampons 2 years later. but she was cool with it. i didnt tell her i had it 2 years prior, she just assumed i just got it.(little did she know lol) any way i just turned 20 and ive been getting it ever since. Beleive me it really isnt that big of a deal. its a par of life. the older u get the more u will realize that. u should just tell her, besides u can get her to buy you your pads/tampons and save some money lol<br>  good luck :-)|`|DCM4neHTaa	I did the same thing, but I was only able to hide it for 18 months. <br>  <br>  In all seriousness, they're not going to keep you off of the team or whatever if your physical says that you don't have your period even though you do. You don't have to tell anyone, in all actuality, even though the info is asked for and it's assumed you'll be honest. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't sweat it. I made it through 6th grade wrestling while lying on my physical about it. <br>  <br>  Don't stress. Bring it up if you want, don't if you're too uncomfortable.|`|DIZ0dFxraa	just tell her. tell her you were embarressed and just stopped thinking about it. she wont get mad, mabe be a little worried. she'll probably laugh at you, at the worst. its not that bad. just tell her.<br>  BELIEVE ME. its not that bad. i remember when i first got it and i had to tell MY DAD. MY D-A-D. it was aweful. believe, you'll be fine. plus it'll probably be better cause she'll pay for your pads and tampons.

If you are thinking of actual methods though, call the suicide hotline immediately.<br>  <br>  You may want to watch the movie, It's a Wonderful Life. Do what the angel helps the hero to do and contemplate how the lives of others would have been different if you had not lived.

Before these blisters appear, the person may experience increased skin sensitivity, tingling, burning, itching, or pain at the site where the blisters will appear.<br>  When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful.

I'd hope you already know that you can get both cases HSV1 and HSV2 in either locations. If you have HSV1 genitally, then the outbreaks tend to be less frequent, and sometimes, once, and never again. But if you have HSV2 genitally, the outbreaks tends to be more frequent and judging from the other answers, longer?

VqFRIJ44aa	Firstly, well done for what you have achieved so far, but please also be careful. 4 inches in such a short space of time can soon have an effect on your energy levels, plus you are coming close to overtraining as a non-professional athlete, training 7 days a week is too much.<br>  <br>  Your body actually changes while at rest, not during exercise. Exercise "tears" muscle and it is doing the rest periods, that your body repairs these muscles and then we start noticing physical changes.<br>  <br>  I note you have just mentioned cardio and no mention of any Resistance training. People are scared of training with weights because of misconceptions it will turn you into a bulky, muscluar freak! So not true. Weights training will far outway the effects of cardio training in your case.<br>  <br>  Anybody with high levels of bodyfat (noticeable through flabby areas of <br>  the body) needs to raise their metabolism, once you do this this you <br>  are actually burning fat while you rest. Also for your cardio, you need <br>  to be very intense and sharp. Continue what you are doing, but to raise the intensity. This could be hill sprints or all out effort followed by <br>  slower recovery periods. So one cardio session could consist of warming up, Sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds and then jog lightly for one minute and repeat this preocess 8-10 times.<br>  <br>  I have incuded a couple of weights routines below for you, which will <br>  not bulk you up, but will give your boby additional fat-burning <br>  capabilities, thus eventually reducing body fat as long as you follow a <br>  sensible diet.|`|mabv1qugaa	Any aerobic exercise is a great way of losing overall weight.<br>  I recommend you run/jog/walk on different paths everyday so you don't get bored. And also you could also throw in some cycling and swimming to keep it varied.<br>  and of course complement it with a balanced diet and you will get in great shape in no time.

KOYC3XkJaa	As a rule of thumb, rug burns are too shallow to cause scarring. You will probably have some residual redness in the area after it finishes healing, but that is not a scar, and will go away in a few days when replaced by healthy skin tissue. <br>  Even if you do get a scar, it will just be flat and the color will fade in a few weeks and it won't be noticeable.<br>  It sounds like yours is almost healed, so there's not all that much you can do. Don't scratch it, don't peel away the skin. If it's very itchy you can moisturize.
oHSzktF4aa	100 pounds in a few months? I'm sorry, but there really isn't a HEALTHY way to do that.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to eat a well balanced 2,000 calorie a day diet. You also need to do some cardio workouts. Do some jumping jacks. Run a mile every other day. A diet alone will not be very affective. At best you'll lose 20 or 30 pounds of fat (if done correctly), but you cannot HEALTHLY lose 100 pounds in a few months.<br>  <br>  Don't believe those "Lose weight quick" commericals/adds. They either don't work or they do work but the results are tempory (a few weeks) and are very dagerous for your health.|`|3533f4919287d52194cf39aedfda9625aa	Diet is a no no, just do portion control and a lot of cardio workout.  You should be aware that you one - two pounds a week is about the right way to lose.  It's all about what you eat, when you eat and the amount.  Make it a life style change.  I suggest lots of fruits, vegetables, and water.|`|bfAn2v0Oaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one method that definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Reader's Digest and CNN.

DYUfnPzhaa	I work in an optometrist office right now.  It really can depend on whether you are in a small office, or a chain like Pearle Vision etc.<br>  I think the environment of your coworkers makes all the difference.<br>  <br>  When it comes to selling glasses or 'frame selection', I really enjoy it!  Its so fun to help people find their style or totally switch up the frames they're used to wearing, for a much more 'hip' frame.  I won't want to sell frames to someone if I thought they could do better somewhere else.  When a person tries on the winning pair you can just tell that it not only 'fits' but actually compliments their face. <br>  <br>   A good pair of frames can really make a statement if you want them too, and that's something you realize working in Optometry!<br>  <br>  Have fun if you decide to work there...|`|9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	I work in that field right now, and I love it! It's the best job I've ever had. I like it because it combines medical with retail (if you work in an office where the actual eye exams are performed). Also, it's unique because in no other form of retail is there sometimes insurance that will help you pay for what you're shopping for, or that actually improves the quality of your life! It's so exciting to help them pick out a frame that they love, then on top on that see the smile on their face when they notice how much better they can see once the glasses are done! <br>  <br>  It's a great job to get into, good luck! =]

Probably a scam of some type.  Best thing to do is get a sleep study.  If he seems to be tired during the day and when he snores if there are pauses in breathing; there is probably a good chance he may have sleep apnea, and if so needs to be treated for it.<br>  <br>  good source of information here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sle...</a><br>  <br>  Snoring comes from a blockage in your air way.  In most cases either your tongue settling to the back of your throat or loose skin from being over weight.  I had the first problem.  I couldn't breath through my nose at night and when I opened my mouth my tongue would blocked my airway...  I had my deviated septum fixed, and no more sleep apnea.

MstGb2WBaa	I was just about to ask exactly the same question. I did some weights last night a feel nauseous. I felt better after I had something to eat so it could be blood sugar levels. I don't know. I think your muscles release some kind of toxin, abit like stir up the silt at the bottom of a fish tank. When you are not used to regular weight training I think this can make one feel sickly to begin with. Its also the same when you have a deep tissue massage.|`|JBOEzcWMaa	diet? make sure you eat and drink something before working out, something with carbs preferably, and definitely not something high in sugar because that will make you want to vomit most def.|`|vQM6kA7Faa	start to drink water when you workout and eat before your workout a good hour before.|`|leHQQX4paa	i think you might be over doing it. lift less weight and go slower and you should be fine|`|EgdR7cfTaa	it could be either not having any food on your stomach or eating too much before you go to workout.|`|JsffWlnEaa	wait at least 40-60 minutes after you eat to train,as all the blood in you goes to your stomach after you eat...

ZZzQLjaKaa	Sleeping pills rarely lead to any type of health benefit long term. They are intended for short term concerns, whereas it sounds you are having a long term issue. Over the counter sleeping pills will not improve your sleep cycles long term.

SrMt01nOaa	Why are you teen girls so self-conscious about your weight?<br>  <br>  Eat something for breakfast, such as cereal, or eggs.<br>  <br>  And what is wrong with a doughnut? who would be angry at you?<br>  <br>  Stop over-reacting to your eating habits.
QueLLNiraa	The true answer to this question is to keep your intake balanced. <br>  <br>  Later in life your metabolism will slow down, and by that time you could have developed a massive appetite for food, which may be hard to remove and that you'll notice it once you start gaining a lot of weight.<br>  <br>  As your metabolism slows down, you burn fat slower which means you'll gain weight extremely quickly.<br>  <br>  So maintain a healthy diet, follow the food pyramid, don't over eat and don't under eat.

You'll even out over time - you have years and years to do so. Being more developed on one side than the other is actually quite normal, especially for girls that are just starting to develop and/or are at a young age, such as yourself. I think that when you get your period, puberty will start getting everything going and you'll develop more.<br>  As for the hair, just get into a habit of shaving your underarms every morning when you shower. <br>  You're not idiotic, you're just concerned. You have no reason to be though! Everything will work out fine! :)|`|8668f05e854dcb2756138e1a4373d74faa	for the most part no one is even but dnt worry you'll prob even out a little more. :)

Your body will give out and then your dad will know something is wrong and he will be upset that you've kept it from him when he might have been able to help. When I was younger, I did that and now I am paying for it. I have stomach and digestive problems not to mention insomnia. I have to take sleeping pills just to get 4 solid hours rest. It's not worth it. Please find SOMEONE to talk to. I don't know how old you are or what the problem is, so this is all the advice I can offer.

z5JkgFOyaa	Glands inside a girl/woman’s vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when a woman is breastfeeding or when a woman is sexually excited.<br>  <br>  Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem.  Some other types of infections such as yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis can also cause discharge that is usually accompanied by odor such as beer/yeast/fish.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you have any of these signs or any concerns regarding this you consult with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and for proper treatment should you have anything other than just a normal vaginal discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|RoqxGbgRaa	it is quite normal, especially during the ovulation phase of your cycle.|`|AA12229118	Perhaps you have an infection of some kind.

Check it out.|`|uAGJz1jEaa	yes and may possibly have an eating disorder. get help, I'v seen how it has affected a close family member of mine.|`|tCBcAhUGaa	no you sound like a girl who paent sgot divorced. ask both aprents abut counseling you need it turst me|`|spXPpyP0aa	depressed|`|L5I2tXvVaa	you sound depressed to me thats a lot of crying.......|`|NrrIDQlIaa	a lot of things sound like they are happening in your life at the moment and you could be depressed but it sounds like at this moment in your life there could be a plenty good reason for being depressed...i do not see a clear picture of depression from here but the best way to get a picture if you have it is you can read personal accounts of people who have depression online or get a diagnosis from a counselor...whatever it is you definitely dont sound sad/(i assume you meant sad/pathetic) you dont sound pathetic or irrational at all...a divorce is a hard thing to go through and sometimes counselors can be a good help when we are having a rough patch in our lives so that might be a good place to be...shutting down is a common thing with depression, shutting down, withdrawing, isolating but the hardest thing to learn is it helps you feel better for the tiniest second but overall it actually makes you feel worse...talking with friends is very good for our self-esteems and getting our frustrations outside us....|`|a23e4caf2e326b2db8b1d2133e715601aa	To answer your question: you do sound depressed. But to me, it sounds like you're having coping issues and don't know of any other way of dealing with your anger or frustrations.<br>  <br>  The best advice I could give you would be to talk with those you can really trust: and I don't mean your friends on FB; trust me, your closest friends can take everything that you say and use it against you when it's most convenient for them. In other words, they're "trifflin" even if you don't seem to think so now.<br>  <br>  Also, try venting somewhere private like typing up something on wordpad or writing something on a sheet of paper. Try to get things into perspective, see what's REALLY bothering you. Is it because of your parents divorcing, or is it because things aren't turning out like you would want them to. Maybe it's something else that's not even closely related to either of those, maybe it's something completely different.<br>  <br>  My last shred of advice would be to listen to some relaxing music and give yourself some time to think over what's going on. My idea of relaxing music would probably differ from yours because mine depends on my mood. Sometimes I can listen to country music, sometimes I can listen to jazz, sometimes I can listen to "Lifescapes", sometimes I can even listen to classic rock.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get to feelin' better. :)
rSOGwYzcaa	Discipline. I had the same problem and then I set a bedtime for myself, and set an alarm to wake up at. Sure, this is all well and good to have goals, but you have to have the discipline to follow through. I find going to bed at 10:30 for someone who has to wake up at 5 (damn you zero hour class) gets me the sleep I need. Even if you can't sleep, leaving the lights off in a quiet room can be surprisingly restful. Give it a try for a month or two and if it doesn't work talk to your doc.
a4IR6tYqaa	Weight training is only a problem if you create injury.  At 14 your body is still growing and if you over train you may create problems with the bone growth.  Looking at this routine I doubt it will hurt you too much, but it depends on a number of variables. This routine will probably do more for endurance and not so much for size. <br>  <br>  Also, look at your routine.  I see lot on the front side of the body but nothing for the back, or shoulders. I also wonder if you are working out the legs?<br>  <br>  Weight training, especially with the routine above, will NOT hurt you and will not stop your growth.|`|HgwYk7rjaa	you will not grow as tall

z5JkgFOyaa	Just before your period is the time of the highest level of estrogen, which is the primary female hormone. Estrogen regulates the female reproductive system. <br>  <br>  Breasts become fuller under the influence of estrogen. It is a way of preparing the body for a possible pregnancy to allow the female breasts to produce milk. Progesterone is also a female hormone necessary for pregnancy. If the female becomes pregnant then progesterone becomes elevated and estrogen lessens. Progestrone means pro-for and gesterone-gestation is a word for pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question. Good luck :)|`|RWhdtG33aa	When we get ur menstrual cycles d hormones in our entire body are affected that y u have cramps, back ache, stomach ache, some girls become very irritated & as u said our breasts n nipples hurt or in my case they feel very tender . it just d way our bodies are designed to function.|`|ETiITRdoaa	because of your hormones|`|IQfaj1BGaa	i think hormones, but it hurts like a beep
JBOEzcWMaa	hope its not an std.. dont worry! its doubtful. a zit-like thing with puss sounds like herpes but there would be more of them. if you have had sex (even oral) within the past few months it wouldnt hurt to get tested for stds though.. just to be sure.<br>  <br>  you can get pimples ANYWHERE on your body though.. so again dont worry too much!|`|70744bc4be63015a2ec2bfa99decb962aa	COuld be an ingrown hair.  DOnt have to shave to get those|`|MpVQE8tnaa	It was a zit and they can hurt if you pop it. Puss comes out of those zits too.Yep you can get 'em there too|`|IM1bLPf6aa	Sounds like a cyst. They are very big, very painful and hard to get rid of without antibiotics. Go see your doctor. Also a hot washcloth soothes it as well.|`|rxk90e6Taa	It's an ingrown hair. At least that's what it sounds like to me. Apply very warm water as often  as possible.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Sounds like a zit, enjoy pooping it|`|ZA18KoC9aa	it could be an ingrown hair|`|vzr1qfQ9aa	It could be an ingrown hair, they always hurt to pop them.<br>  <br>  Soak in warm water, the warmest you can and then try to pop it. Make sure you pull the hair out if it is an ingrown though.|`|JxY5WXF2aa	Yes this is normal. If you pop it make sure you get all the crap out of it and clean it properly. It should be gone in a couple days.|`|nAe0sYrsaa	Zits or ingrown hair can occur anywhere on one's body. sounds like a zit to me.|`|jywM8mObaa	MY SISTER GETS THOSE EVERY ONCE IN A BLUE MOON...NOT REAL SURE WHAT THEY ARE I KNOW SHE WENT TO THE DOC AND IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS..COULD BE AN INGROWN HAIR THOUGH...HOPE THIS HELPS...TRY APPLYING A HOT WASHCLOTH TO IT!!!|`|rSOGwYzcaa	Prob an ingrown hair.

lcNPeZOeaa	NO OF COURSE NOT. <br>  <br>  even if our physical body dies, our souls are immortal. we just shed one body to be born into another one so that we can pay off aour debts according to the Laws of Karma!!!|`|17ea91da3ecc96021322eef63daae79baa	why should i think about anything that would happen in any way, and at any time. why should I waste time thinking and fearing about death which might happen to me at any time, beyond my capabilities to ascertain about timing.No one had escaped death in the past,present and that would be the same for the future too. Yet, i love my life ,should death snatch it away from me ,I hate death.yes, as it could not be conquered by anyone even the mightiest of men, me, have a taint of fear ,as i am already older enough to get in the hands of death.may be I am afraid, I think so.|`|0l1hvLf9aa	who isn't afraid of??????????<br>  it's easier said that done. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches. If you know you will be dying that time only you will feel the fear.<br>  Anyways whoever saying NO, dont believe it, they r just tying to be super hero|`|GoepUF9gaa	yes dude<br>  but i cann't express u|`|AA11355939	No.<br>  <br>  Maybe it has something to do with this part of "The Valiant"  I learned during my freshman year:<br>  <br>  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death shall come but once.  The coward taste of death many times, the Valiant but once.<br>  <br>  I was also with my dad when he died, he just stopped breathing, no great turmoil, no trauma, he just stopped.<br>  <br>  I am also a born again Christian; therefore, I know where my soul is headed.  I have assurance through Jesus.  That makes a hugh difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless you.|`|a9102f3afc18355a069ec08ead164d4baa	Yes of-course...I am....Coz I want to live.|`|ZRG18vnQaa	I'm afraid of dying young (I'm 47 , thats young in a 47 year olds eyes...lol) , When I hit my 70s God willing I don't think I'll be afraid of death , just fear of the unknown|`|k23bgZQlaa	no.one should not be afraid of death, as it the ultimate truth of life(as per sanatan dharm sciptueres). it says god is not the ultimate truth but death. so why be afraid of truth|`|AA11707163	Don't know never meet him or her !|`|NqfUPKiSaa	No, death is a reformation|`|4715b1b2168ae801a0d235d545847f26aa	NOT AT ALL but would surely like to pray last minute to give me a next birth NOT in india anymore so that i dont have to struggle for Visas.

Live life is our motto. death is good friend of ours. It comes silently to comfort us. To take us to a long distance so that we do not suffer much more than what we get in earthly matters. <br>  Only work. Work for yourself. work for manking. Jesus will come to save u in right time. u r the son of Jesus.|`|Rtat1tQqaa	nope why should i be afraid its a real truth thats going 2 happen for sure any how its saying there another life after death ready 2 enjoy a whole new life after one|`|sb1ymEIPaa	Dear pa,<br>  Thank you, am also fine like you then  dear am not afraid. Because based on my karma only,my death will enable & so i want to do possible goodness to others without think about death. BYE HAVE A NICE LIFE.|`|QtJH37KRaa	No.. not at all.. its a fact of life. No one should be afraid of dying its self, but afraid of what they are leaving behind.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Actually no, I'm not. As a child it would put me to sleep crying every night, but I'm okay with it now. It is simply something that happens, and there is no sense worrying about it, as worrying will not change a thing. I don't see it as a source of fear, I see it as just another reason to live my life to the fullest. Death could come at any moment, so why spend your days worrying about it instead of fulfilling the life your given? I also used to worry about what happens after death, which was what really scared me. I pictured myself alone, in the dark, holding my breath forever and I'd burst into tears. But, now, I realize that whatever happens after death is impossible to discover or explain, and that I'll find out eventually so, again, why worry?|`|Dz1AvLjwaa	yes.........after i met the love of my life<br>  i want to live with him forever|`|QD03bB8Aaa	yes, because i do not know how i will die - suffering trauma or just suddenly; how i hope it is the latter! and yes, i am sad that i have to die. i don't think i have been able to achieve a tenth of what i feel i can.|`|b1c6a61de2278655a6aa8decfda8c927aa	death is mandatory to everyone, thats why i am not afraid of death but the death should not be a painful one.|`|twh67AfTaa	NOT AT ALL.<br>           Because it is real you can't escape it<br>                             NEVER|`|FuyXRHHzaa	No,I am not afraid of dying|`|GDtfZjsiaa	I am not.. Waiting for my death|`|9IRukMtxaa	No. Death is natural and not something that I personally fear. Why should leaving this earth to move on to something else be so hard?|`|gGaP2Twoaa	no, because it's going to happen so i might as well accept it.<br>  unless its gonna be slow and painful, then i'm afraid of it.|`|sKLri6mhaa	Death is Truth and certain, life is false, but we still afraid. That's the thing which equalized people in the end make men to believe in all mighty GOD.|`|AA12075153	Nope!

Logically, those who die by committing suicide, are not afraid of death but are afraid of life. That does not mean that those who die natural death are not afraid of death. The apprehension of death is hypothetical as it comes only once in life. Those who survive the death very closely would better know the real apprehension of death.|`|SLL4sNnnaa	Death is a Certain process, and nobody could avoide it.Infact, Lord Buddha got his Divine Wisdom, only after seeing a dead man being carried for cremation. We Hindus believe that Soul is permanent and what dies is only the body. Those who believe in the sanctity of Soul, never errect a memorial and hence only the body is cremated.<br>  <br>  When the Soul leaves the body, the mortal remains are eleminated . Therefore, there is nothing to be afraid of DEATH. In reality the Soul which is permanent never dies and ultimately attains Moksha or mixes in to the ultimate ALMIGHTY.<br>  <br>  If you believe this, then FEAR NOT DEATH.|`|gH7gMs0Paa	Almost everyone of us is afraid of death but pretend as they are not afraid but if you are one who has faced life which is like HELL or is still facing then that kind of person may not fear of death kyonki uske liye zindagi ne zindagi bhar gum diye jitne bhi mausam diye sab me gum diye :(|`|KBRUibSKaa	no why we should afraid by death<br>  d-devlop urself<br>  e-enjoy till u can<br>  a -amaze by thinking u are the one in the world<br>  t-take urself away from sorrow<br>  h-heads of to life|`|rPfyaQ6uaa	i dont really fear death, bu then again, im only 20. most people would fear death either because of they havent made peace with the idea of death and leaving behind life, family and things that make life livable ( happiness, love, great moments in your life) or they fear the uncertainty of death.

I am a spiritual person and practicing Ananda Marga Yoga Sadhana. Its philosophy removes the fear of death..  <br>  <br>  The spirit within us is important and not the physical body. The spirit is immortal, never vanishes or dies. It wants to discard the unwanted, old, us lesss physical body, may not be suitable to hold the spirit and seeking to enter into new and fresh body. Thus, use of the present physical body for sadhana and expand the knowledge to ripen spirit.|`|NaBBJZp2aa	yes! i haven't enjoyed my life so far :(|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Everyliving thing in this world has its unevitable end someday or the other..<br>  why fear it? just try to make the most of what we have before the end is near..|`|JFmb0o0Raa	YES, because if I died then I have no chance to meet my friends again...<br>  The life is very sweet please live it with your friends and family...|`|htLJqQ7raa	i how are you|`|lDlk3jCqaa	no, im afraid of living and the future.<br>  i will go when its my time.|`|7aVDNYcWaa	No. i am not. because i meditate everyday in the morning.|`|086RF4LDaa	no because life is more difficult than death|`|cPjYRq3Vaa	i'm not afraid of death coz....one day everyone has to leave. <br>  <br>  At this moment, i remember a real incident happended to my friend, <br>  On a cold winter morning about 8'o clock he went to a near-by fuel station to re-fuel his bike, after starting to move , he suddenly want to check the tyre pressure, the biker who left just before him was hit & run over by a speedy tanker truck.

The process before I die is a little frightening, but I know I'll be with God once I die, and that's exciting.|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	Not really!<br>  <br>  Being bitten by a snake 'scares me to death', though!|`|8q3fUhQAaa	YES!

But, the idea of leaving behind my loved ones terrifies me.<br>  How will they manage without me?|`|2DhOHlz5aa	yes,because some body depend on me|`|tsZx5Stdaa	No! because death is common for human being but we can't expect this.everbody should be die one day.|`|UKWEgIXGaa	I want to die when I have finished all my duties towards my family.|`|fGZzcdcJaa	No, sometimes i get aggravated to get death!!<br>  Give me Liberty or give me death!!!!!|`|uefBhrT8aa	no i'm not. just waiting for it to happen. wat to live that existing life too. hope it will be fun.|`|LOeyPwh7aa	Yes & No. this is mythological question. that it will decide at the time of death|`|jOzMriHlaa	yes.bcoz before dying i want to njoy my life as much as i can,there r lot many works to do before dying,like i wanna be independent,i wanna do something for my mom n dad...... in short i wanna njoy my life sooooooooooo much before dying........|`|Br3neyBzaa	yes|`|AAduo4Adaa	I am more afraid of what will happen if I have not been a GOD fearing Christian.  <br>  <br>  We are all afraid of the unknown, but I would like to think that GOD has something fabulous (beyond words) waiting for us...along with all our loved ones who have gone before us.|`|kddTPKfdaa	No, we are only here on earth for a brief period of time. If you are a Christian this is not your home, you are only passing thru. You are heaven bound and God said He would never leave you or forsake you. He will be with you thru it all.|`|EvZTXRXBaa	NO , It's a faith|`|ADYBdBJ5aa	yes<br>  because some people are afraid of the unknown<br>  no one truly knows what happens after death<br>  but hopefully i will be with God n thats all that matters|`|jmV30M1Maa	yes|`|aqBj9wDlaa	never , i like this because i think after death we will give re birth and we only change our body . but kisi aur ki death se dar lagta hai , khud marne se kabhi dar nahi lagta .|`|4OIXPJT2aa	yes because i have some responsbilites on me|`|OmV6FXscaa	EXACTLY NOT ,BECAUSE MAN IS MORTAL.|`|XYOYml59aa	Nope, why should I be? It is going to come, I won't be alive forever or anything. Medicine just isn't that good yet, sorry|`|AA12346188	Yes - because I saw the painful death of my wife.<br>  No - because you cannot avoid death - I am already prepared mentally.<br>  I understood the reality of life, after the death of my noble wife i.e.,<br>  UNWANTED BIRTH - UNAVOIDABLE DEATH.<br>  So, whether you are afraid or not, the death is for sure.|`|gYYUFA6Paa	YEAH!!! I actually strife to fulfill my G--D-Give mission, yet I don't wanna complete it, uncertain of what lays ahead of me. I don't wanna find out what awaits me yet, because as I try to live life to the fullest, it would be almost impossible to do so if I knew what was in store (WHAT IF IT'S A BAD THING?) Not knowing can be sometimes known as a form of flattery and as a chance of knowing, if you get what I mean. I am terribly afraid of death itself and no matter how much I try to sync in good thoughts by updating my brain and eliminating all of the negative side effects, I can't do it--I simply can't. However, what will happen will happen no matter how many attempts we strive for and how much effort we truly put into it doesn't make a difference anyway. We just have to have faith in G--D and know that what awaits us is all for the best. Also, I personally believe that G--D doesn't control all of the preferences--that he just takes the thoughts, hopes, dreams, bribes and prayers and takes them into consideration and under thoughts. They are specifically reserved for you particularly. Anyway, I also believe that if you don't complete the personal and private mission given to you fully & completely, you live in another life, and so on, until you really literally fulfill the mission. On top of that, I think that you each have a special timing to be on Earth. However, he doesn't really control it, as it is his choice to prevent what so and so... until you've reach you're goals and highest potential. So, yeah, I cry SOOO much about death, overall and bottom line I suppose it is because of an extremely tragical case and the incident that happened to me several years ago was tragic. In May 21, 2006, when it was my 9th birthday, my mom's grandma (aka My Great-Grandma) died on that exact day! I can't stop thinking about it. IT'S SOOO SAD. To make matters worse, I hadn't seen her since I immigrated from my original country (yeah, I'm foreign exchange, I'm naturally latin and come from Spanish heritage) when I was 3. I was SCARED of her! Yah! THAT'S RIGHT, I sure was, MJM! UGH! It's just... I don't know, she was old... NOT TO MENTION WRINKLED---AND C'MON I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BUT I WAS 3. DON'T INTERPRET ME OR ANYTHING THOUGH. LOL. G--D Bless! <3333<br>  XOXO!|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Not really...just afraid of it happening in a manner that might hurt for an extended period of time.  But really, when it comes...I hope to welcome it.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	No!Death in hindu =YAMA =Guru of Nachiketha.If I get death I get great guru.Respect death/Yama(not suicide)<br>  --You can read information written by yahoo answerers and you know how to write e mail messages to any answerer  here ,by clicking here in profile picture|`|rO0LyKiUaa	No, why should I be... there's my next life to explore when I die.|`|t54UvTviaa	i want to achieve something like name fame in life . before dat i afraid of life, because i have nt fulfil my dreams yet. after achieving something like name and fame in life i want to die like a queen. i wont afraid of life.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Why should we get afraid of death any once born has to die one day or other as an old version in Telugu as ,' Pottina wadu okka rozu chechu powala adhayvidhanga Maricheywadu okka rozu thirugi rawala'.   So do whatever youdo|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	No. It is a means of deliverance.|`|AA10408380	Yeah. It's mostly because of the unknown. I mean, I know I'll just stop and not feel anything even though the world will be going on. But still, it's kinda creepy when I think about the eight hours I was asleep. I don't remember a thing. I went to sleep, then I opened my eyes, and it was daylight. I don't remember anything in between. That's what death is, except w/o the waking up part. It's scary to think u won't wake up...ever. That u won't be there to see things that u wished u could've seen. I mean, I've seen death, I"ve even experienced it, but I dont remember dying. I don't remember waking from it either. So I can't be content with death, because I dont know how it's gonna be, and the unknown is scary because even if it's inevitable, it'll help to know how u'll go, and how u'll rest for all eternity.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	ya i am afraid of death not mine but of dear ones.<br>  because who dies is relieved of all pain and suffering and those who are left behind bear the agony throughout their life.<br>  my father died in 2001 he was relieved of all worldly things but we still feel the ache in our hearts<br>  <br>  i miss him and always repent for hurting him always.|`|QFf9phAmaa	it depends on your mentality.you will get another life after death and it is certain then why to fear? overall life is immortal and a life cannot be ruined|`|hl5cZxO2aa	Have you heard the song of Kishor Kumar as bellow:<br>  Zindagi ek safar hai suhana, yaha kal kya hoga kisne jana<br>  Mot (death) aani hai aa jayegi ek din, Jaan jani chali jayegi ek din<br>  Aeisi baatose kya gabharana, yaha kal kya hoga kisne jaana<br>  Making heart charmig to hear this song sung by Kishor kumar<br>  Dear, Don't be afraid of death.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Yeah, if its at younger age But no, at older age, struggling for everything.<br>  <br>  If this answer is good, please mark it as Best answer.

AA10294399	I had the same problem.  I'm not familiar with the meds you are taking but Xanax helps my anxiety and  panic attacks- in fact, I haven't had a panic attack in 10 years.  Restoril helps me sleep.  Antidepressants did nothing for my anxiety.  Benzodiazapines are addicting and one builds a tolerance to them, however if you are careful they continue to work.  I actually take less now than when i first started treatment with them and that has been over twenty years.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	You are definitely stressed out and have anxiety.  I would recommend learning breathing techniques, meditation, or Yoga.  To fall asleep you may need to distract your mind.  Counting backwards may help.  Numbers are not stressful.  Maybe the drugs are keeping you up also.|`|LS4WzJl3aa	First of all, you stop taking anti-depressants drugs.Continuable use, can damage your liver, shall be creating breathing problems.Take one tablet each day for three days only omniparazol[ocid]. <br>  At night time ,before sleep, shut down all lights, sit calmly in bed,close your eyes, and recite in your heart the mantras till you get a get fast asleep :-<br>  "OM NAMOH SHIVAYA"<br>  you shall live longer and check up the website at :--<br>  <a href="http://www.lawgoddess.org/index.php?option=com_alphacontent&section=41&category=159&Itemid=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.lawgoddess.org/index.php?opti...</a>
tMtBe1lKaa	Allergies, small stroke, overexposure to strong smells or chemicals, drugs, colds, the onset of colds, and neurological disorders can cause this. you probably want to seek medical attention if you want answers or have any other symptoms (dizziness, pain in your head, discoordination.) best of luck!|`|6oASoFr7aa	FжжцK calling a doctor. I'd have my *** in the e.r- with or with out insurance.

AA12266052	If you have dry skin, apply light liquid paraffin immediately after taking bath. Don't use soap.|`|GHZ3fZlsaa	Cleanse, exfoliate and moisturise.<br>  <br>  If you have naturally oily skin, then don't worry about trying to make it "normal" - your skin is a certain type and there are lots of products out there for oily, combination and congested skin.<br>  <br>  Although your skin feels oily, you should avoid anything that drys it out.  So don't use products with Alcohol or harsh detergents.<br>  <br>  You should also read the label of your existing products....Propylene Glycol, Parabens, Sodium Laurel Sulphate - these chemicals can all harm your skin and make it more sensitive and prone to breakouts.<br>  <br>  If you have oily skin then you shouldn't use anything overnight - no night creams, gels etc - for your skin type it is far better to let your skin breath at night.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a Cream Cleanser, a muslin cloth to gently exfoliate and a combination moisturiser which reduces pores and is easily absorbed into your skin so you don't get an oily residue.<br>  <br>  I have put the products I use in the Sources box below.
dZsaZfVkaa	It's way easier with a plastic applicator.<br>  I use tampax PEARL. make sure it's pearl.<br>  You stick it a little bit in and then push on the end until it's all the way in.<br>  Do it at a 45 degree angle.<br>  I know - it feels soo weird but really, it's worth it.<br>  It's sooo much easier than pads.<br>  promise.|`|xpftUFMKaa	Umm...the cardboard tampons aren't really the most comfortable ones to put in. Use like Playtex glide or something. And you need to be completely relaxed because it won't go in if you are tense. Trying to put a tampon in when your not on your period is not the best for you either. There Pretty simple to put in; it's just that some women can't put them in. It's not unnatural, it's just that some can't use them.  <br>  <br>  I don't like putting it in with the one leg up thing. Try sitting on the toilet with your legs open...|`|aoY1089oaa	Yes it helps you.. All ya need to do is read the directions in the box but your supposed to put it in about like half ways where there 2 half's of the applicator meet. and then push the bottom half of the applicator into the top half and that releases the tampon into your vagina.. just make sure you can grab the "little string" to remove it..<br>  <br>  <br>  if you dnt like cardboard tampax makes some with plastic applicators
Im44orotaa	there is nothing they can do for a bruised or broken rib... time is the best healer. ice for the first 48hrs... but since you are past that heat will help sooth the pain.<br>  you could also get a giant ace bandage and wrap it around your ribs tightly for a little extra support.<br>  good luck healing.|`|496e7a1baa81aea865b0b44909bb9234aa	I had broken ribs had bed rest for 11 days in hospital.

BENiX8eDaa	Ah, peanut butter is more of a 'fat' but is one of the good fats if you buy the un-hydrogenated ones that you have to stir first...<br>  <br>  To get enough protein you'd be better off eating hummus, cottage cheese, tofu, assorted lowfat cheeses, soy burgers/dogs, fish (if you eat fish), & beans|`|eVeWxvsHaa	Yes if you are a vegetarian peanut butter is one of the best protein sources. It gives you about 8 grams of protein in every 2 tablespoons. Milk is another great source of protein. (unless you also don't drink milk. I know some vegetarians who don't eat ANYTHING animal related, even if it is not meat)<br>  <br>  Your body doesn't absorb all the protein though. If I remember correctly I think less than half of the nutrients coming in from food are absorbed, but either way peanut butter is excellent. I eat meat and am trying to put on weight for football season and peanut butter is still one of my best choices.|`|urNrb3GBaa	true, peanut butter has a large amount of protien, but in order to gain muscle, you need larger amounts of protien. the protien in peanut butter isnt nearly enough. if you eat it in high amounts, you will gain more fat than muscle.  go to the store and buy muscle milk. cookies n cream is the best.|`|AYyFAt7Naa	Take rice cakes w/peanut butter.

tMtBe1lKaa	30-50 thousand seems to be the range. My mom is a recovery nurse in Oregon, and can make $90,000 annual. She takes overtime and call when she can get it though. The average doesn't mean anything. It has to do with where you live and what company you work for. Also, whether you are a nurse in a pediatricians clinical practice or at a pediatric department or unit in a hospital. Generally, specialty nurses make more than general nurses, hospitals pay more than clinics, nightshift pays more than day shift, city hospitals pay more than rural hospitals. Northern states pay more than southern states, and managerial staff get more than newbies or regular positions.<br>  In most places nurses are always needed, so you do have job security, and will probably make more than other jobs. Pick several cities or areas you would like to live and work, and ask them what their general pay is. They won't tell you specifics, but may state a range to give you an idea.|`|AA11315244	depending on state A pediatric nurse salary can have an average range of $30,000 to $50,000, with some able to command salaries of up to $100,000 depending on experience.|`|JxY5WXF2aa	Depends on your educational background is or what degree you hold. With an associates degree it is probably anywhere between 40-45,000 a year. With a bachelors degree anywhere between $53,000 being the lowest $58,000 being the median and $63,000 being the highest. All of these figures are based on where you live and where you work as well. People with even higher degrees such as a masters or graduate certificate make between 70-90,000 a year. Sometimes more.

(this helps to let the words roll-off and not take it personally)<br>  <br>  Take 5 seconds before you react - THINK  <br>  "What difference will this make 5 years from now???"    <br>  (This is an attitude changer to be able to take the pressure off )|`|MfIz3TPVaa	calm down.  try to think before you react ,seriously its not worth it .you may wind up having a stroke or heart attack.

2Dy6jZBtaa	its bed bugs, possibly fleas...yes bed bugs, they are nocturnal insects, so they only come out at night...they live in the mattress if ur mattress gets infested with them...the best u can do is toss ur mattress out after doing proper cleansing of the mattress, don't what the bedbug population to get worse around the area u live in and all is why. disinfect all of ur clothing and dressers, closets carpet, box spring, etc with some really hot water and bleach to clean the hard furniture. as well as get bed bug killer for ur carpets and chairs in ur house...<br>  here is pretty much all the info ul ever need on bed bugs..but u do need to do a really great clean sweep of ur place and if u have the cash, hire a pest control person to do it all for u a few times...it takes a few times around to get em all.<br>  <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/</a><br>  u really do have to do a clean sweep a few times mostly because of larva issues...bed bugs bread like wild fire.<br>  after u disinfected everything, cover ur matress in plastic..like a case for it. leave it on and put rur sheets and bed spread on top and that is how ur bed will be made up for a little while till its pretty certain that they are all gone.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	Could be body lice.

I have never used it but understand it works well.  You need to take it within 72 hours of having unprotected sex to be effective.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|PyjZVn28aa	yes..it might be be small price for what can happen..i have taken the pill...it costs about 65.00 in NJ...and if you dont get your period atleast one week later..you are pregnant.....i dont remember if i had anyside effects b/c i was 18 at the time..now iam 20....so its been a while...but..its a good idea to take it...to be safe....one more thing..you have to be 18 years old...to buy it OTC|`|498858d062c282903b8e821194cc5fb7aa	I took the morning after pill yesterday around 4p.m. for sex i had at about midnight the night before. You can take it up to 3 days[74 hours] after unprotected sex or if the condom breaks.<br>  <br>  But the sooner you take it the more effective it is.<br>  <br>  The side effects really suck and for plan b where i live its $50 for both of the pills. <br>  <br>  I don't think the side effects would be worse for you they aren't bad, you'll just be bitchy and dizzy, maybe a little nauseous.<br>  <br>  [And a correction for the person above me, If you don't get your period within THREE weeks, you need to get a test]|`|9QC1MD4Naa	If you had unprotected sex 24 hours ago, get the pills NOW. They only work if you take them within 72 hours, but they're more effective the sooner you take them.<br>  <br>  The pills cost about $55. The only side effect I felt was nausea. It's normal to have bleeding and cramps too. I guess it worked wonders because I didn't get pregnant after our condom slipped off.<br>  <br>  You also have to be 18 to get it without a prescription. They will check your ID. If you're not 18, you'll have to get a prescription from your doctor.

GpvZml6Daa	When I first started doing oral sex on my boyfriend it took a while for him to climax because I wasn't doing it properly (I was doing it too slow). Now a couple months later and after A LOT of practice he climaxes pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  -If he's soft when you start lick/suck aggressively (but pay attention not to hurt him) to get him hard<br>  -The head is the most sensitive part, put forth most of your effort there. If I want to make him come quickly I only pay attention to the head and I jerk him off while I do it. <br>  -Try to lick the head fast, either swirling your tongue along  edges or batting it with your tongue. Sucking is effective too. <br>  -Try to deep throat it -- it will turn him on even more, if you you can't don't force yourself because you will vomit and that will destroy the whole act/mood <br>  -Cover you teeth with your lips (so you don't hurt him) and move your head up and down his member quickly. <br>  -If/when you get tired, stroke him up and down with you hands (from base all the way to the head), hold firmly (like a banana) and try to go semi fast (not too fast or  you'll hurt him and not too slow or he'll get soft)  -- if you're not sure ASK him while you're doing it.<br>  -When he's about to climax DON'T SLOW DOWN/STOP -- even if it hurts your jaw/hand/tongue or he might lose it and you have to start over. <br>  <br>  I find the most effective method is to alternate those techniques. Also, the most comfortable position for me is for him to lie down, while I kneel against the bed/sofa. Communication is also important -- listen to what he says, asks if it feels good. Also, before you start ou should also talk about where he's going to climax (in your mouth or not) and if he is allowed to push your head down on his member. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vj2pWs9Maa	I have found it's much easier to use your hand and your mouth (and lube!) - alternate when one or the other gets tired.  And what really seems to get him going is when I just concentrate on the end of his thing (don't know how much detail I can use!) - he goes really quick!|`|VegwUJiCaa	ditch him and find another one|`|fhCR7Fu1aa	Figure out what part about him is the most sensitive, and work that spot like there is a diamond engraved in it.

Also, the tip of the penis is the key area that makes a guy finish.  Use lots of saliva and lots of tongue.  But some people can't finish from oral...he might be masturbating too much also!|`|wGW1pmTxaa	try giving him a hand job for a while, then go down. He may be a bit nervous to as well. My boyfriend would always make excuses like stop for a sec just so he didn't. Just try doing the hand job fastly then go down. It will probably take a while.|`|1CTbPfbqaa	Why would you want it shorter? All that will do is make it less pleasurable for him.|`|JENUSXuDaa	I am in your same situation (but on the guy's side of it)...it could be technique...don't be too repititive in your movements, that could get boring after awhile (both mentally and physically), change speed, angles...also, nothing turns a guy off more than a girl who acts like doing that is a chore and a burden (not saying this is you)...but make sure you act like you LOVE this or dont do it at all. Oh and to add to a previous comment, find his sensitive spot, the head is a good starting point but also right under the head where it joins the rest is also very good...at the start, lick various areas to test and watch/listen to him very closely.<br>  <br>  Hope that wasn't TOO detailed. Also as a side note...it may just be him wanting more than just that (speaking from experience)...if he's had sex before, even if it was just once, he may rather that than anything else...sorry if its a sad truth but it is. you may want to check into his feelings about waiting (was it a mutual decision or was it more your insisting/demanding? be honest...).

KOYC3XkJaa	It could be an infection, ingrown nails very often get infected.<br>  Another possibility is that it's still ingrown, deeper down where you can't see it. It might not be sore now, but as your nail grows it will start hurting again.<br>  Best bet is to head to the doctor's and have the ingrown nail removed. Otherwise it will just keep coming back.
W2z5dCrmaa	It didn't used to be normal, but Dudes and Girls start puberty sooner now, and know way more about sex at an earlier age than in the past.<br>  <br>  The term normal means that a thing occurs at a high noted number of times in the social structure and if often enough, it becomes the norm, or becomes know as normal.<br>  <br>  It doesn't happen enough that people are aware of yet to call it normal, but if they turn out to be comfortable enough with each other, it could easily happen. They could have hung out together since play school, and that would make it possible, from playing doctor at a young age and then just growing to puberty. Haha!<br>  <br>  All of the things about it are really normal, so I wouldn't think him to be abnormal or her, only the age at which they started would be thought as not usual.

W2z5dCrmaa	That's a one to seven expansion ration, which is quite unusual.<br>  What I'm saying is that the hollow bodies of a penis don't normally expand seven time their resting size. There just isn't enough tissue elasticity to do that under usual circumstances.<br>  <br>  It's possible. because some of us are showers as in a nice jeans package, and some of us are growers as in really small and then when the time for action comes, there's lots to work with.<br>  <br>  Others are both showers and growers.

A healthy weight for your age and height would be 122 - 164 pounds.<br>  <br>  your calorie allowance for a day is around 1900 so eat at least 2400 calories a day to gain 1 pound a week! (3500 calories = 1 pound)<br>  <br>  by the way your case is very likely to be hereditary as your entire family is thin, in which case i don't see any medical threats, however try and eat healthy and more than your calorie allowance a day. Go to a gym and do strength training BUT you need an expert's advice being a 13 year old. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Yes.  This is too thin.  It is partly because of your genes and partly because of your age (you are growing vertically more than laterally) but you should be careful and make sure you consume enough calories and all of the nutrients you need.

I wouldn't worry though.. I'm sure as you age it will slow down. Some people are just heavier than others. I would say that your weight is kind of unhealthy, however.

So to have strong muscles will make your body stronger in general. Plus it will help you put some meat on your bones!|`|FcKxoOPGaa	OF COURSE !

Here are some of the more popular natural remedies for menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  Magnesium, acupressure, omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat diet, vitamin E, vitamin B1, heat (such as a heat pack, warm bath/shower), aromatherapy, massage, calcium, chiropractic exercise or you could go to the chemist and ask them for something for the pain if none of the above-mentioned helps.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if painful cramps during your period is so bad that it interferes with your daily activities or causes you to miss work/school because of it, that you definitely see your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation as painful periods can sometimes be caused by conditions such as endometriosis which can sometimes cause severe pain from an early age (although the pain typically gets worse as the disease does more damage with each monthly cycle). Other causes can include fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease and sometimes a narrowing of the cervix (using all these conditions as examples only).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

The older you get, your metabolism will start to slow, which will make it harder for you to lose weight. My opinion is to get started working out now.. nothing major, but make sure that you do about 30 minutes of cardio at least 3/4 times a week. If you feel like you want to add muscle (another really good way to lose weight) make sure that you start out slowly, and gradually build up to higher weights. Having some muscle would definitely help you feel better about yourself as well!

tMtBe1lKaa	Wow, it depends on what state you live in and thier laws concerning medical treatment for minors. If it is an issue related to sexual behavior, try planned parenthood or the public health department. In many states, you can get birth control and counseling without parental consent. Some allow abortion also, but that is a big decision. I had a daughter when I was 16, if it is something related to that, email me and I might be able to help. <br>  If you have hurt yourself, you can call 911.<br>  If you need to talk to someone about depression or other mental health issues, you can contact the health department. If you can tell your parents that you "just need to talk to someone", they may seek the right kind of help. Good parents are advocates for thier childrens health, that includes mental health.

dpgXzMenaa	Having vaginal sex alone isn't a very effective way to have orgasms for most women, because the vagina isn't the place where women's most direct sexual pleasure comes from.   The clitoris is.<br>  <br>  It might interest you to know that by the age of 12, 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that by age 15, it's 2/3 of them doing it *regularly* (many of them more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse.<br>  <br>  ... or that the very first thing sex therapists teach women who've never had an orgasm is how to masturbate - because that's the *only* sure fire way for a woman to learn how her body responds sexually and what will bring her to orgasm.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. <br>  <br>  Once you can have orgasms dependably when you masturbate, you can have them dependably whenever you have sex with a partner... either by giving them to yourself during sex or by teaching your partner what works for you so *he* can give them to you.<br>  <br>  Seriously. <br>  <br>  And if you don't have orgasms alone... it's time you learned: how's your man gonna know how to get the work together with you if *you* don't even know what the job is?<br>  <br>  It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm... both of these are unusual but normal, and anything in between is just fine.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it might happen that there'll be no interruption at all between orgasms, and it can feel like one single orgasm that lasts anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|70744bc4be63015a2ec2bfa99decb962aa	Ask him what he wants and do it, only if you fell comfortable with it, but try somethings for him.|`|AA11404315	you poor thing........."a stiff dick has no conscience"...you have needs girl....get a man!|`|BcWs38MWaa	duh try all the positions u know ones he knows touch tease before u have sex go down on him lick suck his balls masturbate man there are so many things u can do im very flexible if u r too put ur lega behind ur head and do the splits n let him f   u from the back that way talk dirty to him "yeah daddy i want u to f|_|k me, i luv dat d!k in me, depped baby, yeah f|_|k me. mh yes yes yes yes ah right there papi si ayyyy" things like this talk to him in spanish or maybe in other languages u kno<br>  <br>  its not normal for someone with 2 years of going out to not enjoy their sex|`|bKDBbGmuaa	read the cama sutra it will help you out on alot of position and somtime there exotic if you dont know where your g spot is  learn and then teach him it is instant orgasm|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	Be straight up with him & tell him that he has lost his mojo.

Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas.

(if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I tried to send an email but it did not work.

ksxlW3HQaa	I don't know abut the headache, but I do know that when you have a fever even a low one, and if it breaks (starts going down) then you will feel hot.  If you have a high fever like 103 and it comes down to 98.6 then you'll probably feel hot and sweat a lot. So possibly, that means you're getting better.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, the antibiotics will fix the infection.  After the infection is down, they can then fix the abscessed tooth.  <br>  As long as you're taking the antibiotics, you'll be ok.|`|MPbB0ri1aa	You have a fever, because you have an infection. <br>  <br>  Did you contact your dentist after your first visit to the ER? Antibiotics alone will not take care of that abscessed tooth. You need a root canal to take care of it once and for all. Your headache is most likely from the infection, too.<br>  <br>  Be sure to drink lots of fluids, if your temp gets over 101 degree F call your doctor and call your dentist as soon as possible.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Probably the infection. The tooth can't be worked on until the swelling is down & that's what they gave you meds for. You could put an ice pack on your jaw for some relief. Call & ask if you can take Ibuprofin for swelling & pain and/or Tylenol w/ the meds they gave you. Since you went to ER, they will probably answer you on the phone if you call & say you were there, but now...then proceed to decribe what you said here that is going on now. They can advise you better. <br>  <br>  Use your own discretion whether you should try this...I personally would try to puncture my gum w/ a small hole & get some of the pus out, but that's just me. I have a low pain & med tolerance, so I'd find a way to give myself relief. Then gargle w/ Listerine & peroxide & water & salt (don't swallow) to disinfect.|`|mx3YK5rLaa	It sounds like you NEED to get that tooth pulled or something. Abscessed teeth can be very dangerous, the infection can go to your brain (because your infection is in your teeth, which is close to your brain) and cause permanent damage. GET THE TOOTH PULLED OR FIXED! ASAP!!<br>  <br>  It almost sounds like you are having a reaction to the medication.
9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	Yes, it's bad:<br>  <br>  1) Your scars will identify you to others as someone with mental problems. <br>  <br>  2) You haven't learned healthy ways to deal with stress, anger and other negative feelings.<br>  <br>  3) Cutting will only get worse.<br>  <br>  4) You are in denial big time.<br>  <br>  5) People who engage in compulsions are not happy well adjusted people.|`|gGaP2Twoaa	its bad because it harms you.<br>  try doing something else, like writing or drawing.<br>  <br>  EDIT: oh, and cutting is bad. i know first-hand, i still have scars. i have to wear long sleeves even if its one of those rare days where its acutally warm out.|`|SdOtY7Isaa	yes;  because still anyone who was happy.. & loved themselves wouldnt do that.<br>  if you need help there are suicide lines <br>  and stuff.|`|L5I2tXvVaa	thats a real problem.....its a sighn of mentall ilness            cause normal ppl dont do that          maybe doctor can help you|`|DQNegurEaa	Well i cut myself on my wrist and i do shallow cuts like you and it makes me feel better so i really dont see whats bad about it but people think that its just weird that you do that because that recation is people dont like to get hurt and so when someone does it to themselves i think that they think that its just different and they think bad of it so no not really|`|dCoGR2Tdaa	no because once you start that is the only way to ever be happy again, and it brings you a lot of joy the longer you do it. i know this because my mom works with cutters for a job and she has to make people stop and she says they are never happy again. its not bad.|`|JJZi7r6maa	Yeah, because threessalwaysypossibilityy to you can cut deeper than you intended to. And when others find out you aren't only hurting your body but you are hurting those around you that truely love and care for you..

Please find other ways of coping. What about a punching bag. Also you need some therapy.. Good luck to you.|`|w6OyaSPzaa	Wow... thats not good.. You should probly get some help before you get addicted to doing it or else your going to hurt yourself really bad.. Good luck ;)|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	if you dont think you have a problem then why are you posting this question?|`|NrrIDQlIaa	It's not bad...some people blinded by stigma are like omgod its bad generally because they think its related to suicide even when its not and if it is it generally is to keep the suicidal thoughts away...but whatever its not bad, its a coping strategy that is how you have learned how to deal with your world some people choose cigarettes another reason why i dont find it quite so bad...however the appearance thing can make it a real issue and the mental stigma thing can make you feel like **** because other people dont understand and especially in relationships...it can also become bad if say you cut not that deep thats fine but do you treat it and is what youre cutting with sterile, if not it can become infected and than can pose serious issues to your health...and then afterwards the problem can also become if your behavior escalates say the small cuts dont work anymore for you and you have to keep cutting more and more to get the same effect (that can obviously pose as a problem) and it can happen so gradually you dont really notice the escalation or it can happen extremely fast too so its different...but yes its a coping mechanism helping you get thru the day which is good people have to cope but cutting can create some serious problems later...a lot of cutters actually die from infections i didnt know that i mean i totally treat mine but i found that wierd...|`|a9c1ab7b93c0a25db7b6e9027f704f7aaa	just don't do deep ones.

FOjurlZZaa	its not a huge deal. actually your body is just reacting to the so called uh change i guess you could say. basically the pain you feel is your body healing itself. if you think about it, ya you literally just did rip part of your skin. so its just your bodys reaction to heal itself is the pain you are feeling. and blood, ya that happens to. but it does get better, i promise. <br>  nothing ot be embarrassed about, i promise.<br>  and no if definatley not an STD.<br>  dont worry its not that gross or detailed or anything. really you will be fine.<br>  i hope this helped.|`|DIZ0dFxraa	possible UTI and a cut. easy fix. no worries.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	it sounds like there was not enough lubrication when he penetrated you.  next time, make sure you're lubricated enough.  you might want to add some lube--like ky--to help ease things a bit.<br>  <br>  for the time being, you shoud probably apply a layer of vaseline to your vaginal area to help heal the dryness.|`|ZD6H6nGgaa	well the best answer will come from a doctor but sounds like maybee not lubricated enough?? or a UTI, DRINK lots of water before and after sex. but def go to the doctors to get checked out|`|urNrb3GBaa	may be the size of his penis. he may have broken the walls.|`|Q65vW0QXaa	not lubricated enough?|`|kNLi16C6aa	might be a bit of thrush.<br>  <br>  easily fixed. Your dr can explain more.|`|wol6ECnQaa	Abstain from sex for the meantime, as you haven't consulted a doctor yet. More sex might add more pain, we could only assume but it's better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Know your body well, the burning sensation that you feel may be due to the vaginal wall bruised by the intense friction which is made worse by being not "wet" or lubricated enough.<br>  <br>  As for the possibility of UTI, pay close attention to exactly when the burning starts and stops. With urinary tract infection, the burning is felt as the urine passes down the tube on its way out.<br>  <br>  Hope this somehow helped by easing your mind.<br>  Post an update on what the doctor says. Good luck and be well.
YSr8dm5faa	How old are you? I ask because wisdom teeth begin to erupt from the gum around 17-21yrs old. The front half of the upper 3rd molars come in contact with the back half of the lower 3rd molars usually, but your lower 3rd molars should kick in first before the upper sets do. If you're having pain in the very back of your tooth, you may very well be having them. See your dentist.

Ve6RAuq3aa	autoimmune disease. this is where the bodies immune system (in this case the white blood cells) attack other parts of the body (in this case, the red blood cells). examples include lupus, vasuculitis etc. often autoimmune disease are treated with corticosteriods which help suppress the immune system|`|0nyWiro9aa	It's called erythrophagocytosis and can be quite common with hemolytic disease of the newborn. In mother who are type O for instance and have a baby that is type A then it's possible for the mother to have immune anti-A antibodies cross the placenta and coat the baby red blood cells. Such coated cells with antibodies are detected by macrophages who's role it is to attack such coated cells and digest the offending cells. Normally they are foreign microorganisms. This is only for newborns.<br>  <br>  In older babies, one steps into the Autoimmune Hemolytic anemia's that can be induced by a post viral infection in some cases, that causes the production of antibodies which tends to either cross react with the babies on red cells or the agent causes conformational changes in the red cell antigen altering it to make it appear foreign and thus the production of antibodies begins against the babies own red cells. The immune cells then begin destroying them.<br>  <br>  One has the immune disorders, immunodeficiency states of acquired and some of which can also be congenital.<br>  <br>  It is important in all cases of suspected anemia's especially associated with normal size red cells to do a test detecting antibodies on the red cell surface in order to diagnose an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The presence of microspherocytes (small color condensed red cells) and erythrophagocytosis is consistent with such findings also.|`|tYt2AEcZaa	It can cause disease or sickness.

OLXv3DEAaa	You should go to the doctor. They can do a simple checkup to check for scoliosis and if that is not it they can try to figure out what else would cause the joint/back pain. <br>  <br>  Anyway, yes it could also be scoliosis from what you described. I am pretty sure that certain types of scoliosis are inherited so you might have a higher than normal chance of it. <br>  <br>  It could be some kind of muscle imbalance like you're stronger on one side than the other or just weak muscles or maybe you got an injury to your back? For that kind of problem you might need to do some exercises or physical therapy to keep your back from hurting. I'm not sure what they'd do for scoliosis it depends how severe it is.|`|3YEmU25Paa	I'm not sure about the sore back and sharp pains. But about the head tilt and shoulder level discrepancy is probably because one of the shoulder muscles (trapezius) and one of the neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid) are innervated by the same nerve. You may have some sort of problem with that nerve, should probably see your doctor. As far as scoliosis, I think the rule of thumb is if there is a 10-15 degree variation in your spinal curvature you should get it check out by your pediatrician or an orthopedist. Hope this helps.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Scoliosis is hereditary in that people with scoliosis are more likely to have children with scoliosis; however, there is no correlation between the severity of the curve from one person to another. Scolliosis is more common than you think. Many believe have and not even know it. It is a simple test that is done to find out as well. Also pretty much all children and checked for it while growing. Ask your parents if the doctor ever mentioned it to them if you had it or not. Or just ask to see your doctor and get it checked out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.........|`|3SwWwR4aaa	I am an X-ray tech and the only real way to find out is to have an X-ray of your T-spine and L-spine.<br>  I have seen patients which appear to have straight spines are really curved when X-ray'd.

ygcbrp5Uaa	Well I know this is a bit gross, but if your diarrhea is watery and kinda leaves a foam when it's in the toilet, it's because you're pooping out stomach acid. When this happens, the acid (like it's intended to) will literary eat away the skin around your anus on the way out. This very easily causes bleeding and a lot of discomfort. If it's frequent though, (5 or more times a day) then it's possible that maybe you didn't wipe properly at one point and one of the lesions form the acid got infected, which could explain the bump. <br>  <br>  Try eating bread and crackers to soak some of the acid in your stomach up. If necessary, try taking some ant-acids. If this doesn't help with in the next 3-4 days, then see your doctor. <br>  <br>  To relieve some of the pain and help heal the area, I know this is embarrassing, but try going out and buying some butt cream to put on and around the anus after you clean up from pooping with a Q-tip or cotton swab.

d6M0jmIkaa	Personality disorders are very complex, some studies do support that there is a genetic bases for the disorder.  But chances are it's a combination of nature and nurture.  You need the genetic predisposition towards having it, but traumatic events can trigger the onset of the illness.  But you don't need a traumatic event or a bad childhood to develop a personality disorder, though those factors defiantly exacerbate it.  And it is possible to develop the disorder without any clear family history of it, as I said they are very complex.<br>  <br>  "Antisocial personality" is a disorder, it's full name is Antisocial Personality Disorder and it is actually closer to being a sociopath than actually being antisocial.  There are many different types of personality disorders.

Here are some of the more popular natural remedies for menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  Magnesium, acupressure, omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat diet, vitamin E, vitamin B1, heat (such as a heat pack, warm bath/shower), aromatherapy, massage, calcium, chiropractic exercise or you could go to the chemist and ask them for something for the pain if none of the above-mentioned helps.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if painful cramps during your period is so bad that it interferes with your daily activities or causes you to miss work/school because of it, that you definitely see your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation as painful periods can sometimes be caused by conditions such as endometriosis which can sometimes cause severe pain from an early age (although the pain typically gets worse as the disease does more damage with each monthly cycle). Other causes can include fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease and sometimes a narrowing of the cervix (using all these conditions as examples only).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

You aren't shooting out your useful testosterone, only your sperm, already lost testosterone  and total components that make up semen.  ..... the need for, and producing more sperm causes more testosterone production along with it. The two productions work hand in hand.<br>  <br>  Your balls are ducted gland for sperm through the Vas to your inner sex engine, but are endocrine glands when it comes to testosterone, meaning ductless and working directly into the blood steam.

These are the necessary precautions you should take to ensure your hormonal safety. Stop masturbating IMMEDIATELY. You are completely correct when you say masturbating drops your testosterone levels. Each time ejaculation occurs, testosterone is expelled directly through your urethra. Think about it from a logical standpoint; semen contains testosterone, and when you ejaculate, you lose semen, thus you lose testosterone. If you are addicted to masturbation, the best thing to do would be to stop cold-turkey, or get started on started on steroids.

z5JkgFOyaa	Periods that are too frequent (more often than every 28 days also called "metrorrhagia") can be related to several predisposing factors:<br>  <br>  If the periods are otherwise normal, then a short "luteal phase" or insufficient ovarian production of progesterone may be responsible.  If the periods are inconsistent, then failure to ovulate and the resulting anovulatory bleeding may be responsible.  If the periods are actually normal and once a month, but there are episodes of bleeding in between the periods, then mechanical factors such as fibroids or polyps may be responsible.  Women with hyperthyroidism are classically described as experiencing frequent, heavy periods. They, in reality, rarely show that pattern, but doctors usually screen these patients for thyroid disease anyway. <br>  <br>  Early stages of pregnancy might be a possible cause as well, but it could happen if you change your eating habits, are stressed, have a lot on your mind, etc. Our emotions and hormones collide a lot.<br>  <br>  I've experienced frequent periods too in the past that was caused by ovarian cysts.<br>  <br>  There could be other causes for the frequent periods you are experiencing and I would recommend you see your doctor/gyno for further evaluation to see what they think could be causing this.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Pregnant...|`|7lCJWU52aa	it sounds like you could be pregnant. but the brown liquid you mentioned, i had that a few weeks before having my son. defiantly go to the doctor xx<br>  Ps, i had periods for the FIRST 3 months of my pregnancy xx|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	I really can't answer that question, but your avatar looks like it has a tiny goatee.|`|ETiITRdoaa	you could be diabetic you should see a doctor soon|`|4BdFfeLpaa	Take a pregnancy test. If you're sexually active and not taking birth control then there is a high possibility that you are pregnant! <br>  The bleeding you described as a "second period" could well be in fact implantation bleeding which can occur when the embryo implants in your womb. This is what I had when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now 3 months old.<br>  (I assumed I was having my period but by the second day it was just a brownish discharge like you are describing and then ended) <br>  The other symptoms you are having sound awfully familiar for pregnancy too so to rule it out I'd get myself tested.<br>  good luck!|`|qoyokiSiaa	Well, for one you could be pregnant.... You do not have to miss a period to be pregnant. Or your body might be changing meaning your hormone levels could be fluctuating. Depending on your age and how long you have been having a period. I would just relax and try not to stress over it to much then wait a couple weeks and try a cheap pregnancy test. Yes I said cheap only because all tests will tell you if you are or not they just want to fool you into paying a arm and a leg for them. The only trouble is you need to make sure you wait long enough after your period before taking one. I usually waited 10-14 days after my missed one but you could wait that long after your last day of your period and should be fine. If you have to buy a couple and wait a few days in between. As for how you feel you dont really feel anything but nausea for awhile and some people dont even show any signs for months. Anyways just relax it will be ok and Good Luck<br>  <br>  Jen :)

It's all a matter of will really if you wanna stop then stop and talk about things with ashlee, if you feel like cutting then talk to her and say what's happened to make you want to and talk. Usually I would say tell the parents but see how you fair with friend support first see how you cope. I say this all from experience, I cut for 7 years and I have been clean for at least 2, and I can tell you there are times I want to cut again but I push through them and try to talk. I also got rid of my cutting stuff, I started using a compass then moved onto scissors and knives but get rid of whatever you use. And just try, try and not do it.

The compulsion to cut yourself may be greater when your seeking attention and as the old saying goes with kids any attention will work even if its bad attention. Your so young and trust me right now your BF might seem like the best thing since sliced bread but there will be other boys. YOu really need to focus on yourself and your schooling. Hurting yourself doesnt just hurt you its painful for your family and friends to watch you do this to your self and not really fair to them. Only you can control yourself though..you just have to want it bad enough. You can do great things and be anything you want to be. I hope this helps and hon please stop cutting yourself..those scars will stay there for the rest of your life. Good Luck
Tkkc3Wasaa	In order to burn away the abdominal fats , you will need to do a full body workout instead of just doing exercises to target your abs.<br>  <br>  Also, you will have to monitor your diet everyday. Try to have a diet of 5-6 small meals each day of calorie content of 500-650. Avoid starving yourself before your next meal as there is a high chance you will exceed the calorie intake for the meal when you eat on an empty stomach.<br>  <br>  The calorie intake each day depends greatly on your Resting Metabolism Rate (RMR) which can be calculated using the formula :<br>  <br>  For male : [66 + (12.7 x height) + (6.27 x weight) – (6.8 x age)] x Workout Intensity Factor.<br>  <br>  For female : [655 + (4.57 x height) + (4.36 x weight) – (4.7 x age)] x Workout Intensity Factor.<br>  <br>  Where weight is measured in pounds<br>  and height is measured in inches.<br>  <br>  The workout intensity factor varies according to how much you workout. Give yourself an intensity factor of 1.3 ( for non active people ), 1.4 ( for moderately active) and 1.5 ( For very Active ).<br>  <br>  For a person who workout intensively 4-5 days /week, he is considered as very active.<br>  <br>  Once you know your RMR, you will be able to monitor how much calorie intake you need per day to lose or gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  The next thing you will need to get your 6 - pack abs would be a good workout program.<br>  <br>  Try to commit yourself to your workout program up to 3 times per week. Any session more than 3 times each week may lead to over-training and this will be counterproductive towards obtaining your abs.<br>  <br>  For your ab-training exercises, try to commit to just 2 times each week with each session lasting for about 10-12mins. Similarly, any session more than this will lead to over-training.<br>  <br>  A few good ab exercises would be ab bicycles, ab scissors and ab crunches.<br>  <br>  With a good diet and a good workout program , i am sure you will be able to lose fats pretty fast.<br>  <br>  Hope this clears your doubt<br>  <br>  Cheers <br>  <br>  Alan|`|JsffWlnEaa	diet is 80% weight lose|`|9oRgTCjKaa	You can lose that fat off your stomach with the wu tea diet.

TdqeC0vmaa	Well it depends on the severity of each. <br>  A severe case of borderline is worse than a mild case of bipolar and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Their is a relatively high rate of suicide in both <br>  <br>  Bipolar results in suicide in both depressive and manic phases or death related to bad judgment in manic phases. They can loose finances jobs and relationships. The moods last a long time so the life of someone can be disrupted for months to years without treatment. <br>  <br>  Borderline results in suicide often as well due to intensity of emotions and difficulty in impulse control. Loss of a loved one or a perceived loss can result in suicide. Also the multiple suicidal gestures can accidentally lead to suicide. The moods of borderlines are short lived but intense. Though they do not feel the consequences of sustaining a depressed or manic mood for months or years the frequent intense mood swings and bizarre behavior they insight can result in loss of relationships jobs etc as well<br>  <br>  Bipolar is easier to treat due to the fact that it is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and can be treated with medications to regulate the imbalance and occasional emergency medications and assistance to treat acute episodes. The difficulty in bipolar is being able to diagnose it. Often someone goes years and years diagnosed as depressive until they have their first manic episode or a strong family history hints that bipolar may be the cause.<br>  <br>  Borderline has to be treated with lengthy therapy. You can give medications to treat severe symptoms. But this is like taking medicine for a cold. It alleviates some symptoms but does nothing to treat the cold itself. Often years of therapy and periodic medications as needed are the course for this illness.|`|xnZi0i8saa	There is a new therapy that was designed specifically for Borderline Personality Disorder. It's called Dialectic Behavior Therapy and it's supposed to be fantastic! I use it also but for Bipolar. I can't say for everyone but I think I prefer being Bipolar over Borderline....... i do not have the problems with anger, manipulation, abandonment... etc that those with borderline have. I would say that Bipolar can be the most debilitating because it is a chemical disorder where borderline is learned behavior...... Suicide rates among any mental illness are highest with bipolar. Much higher, not only attempted suicide but successful suicides..... Being in a mixed state puts you at the greatest risk of suicide....... <br>  <br>  Each person is different though....... a severe case of borderline will be much worse than a mild case of bipolar..... I can say how I feel but how can anyone say that in general one is worse that the other...... doesn't it really suck to have either? <br>  <br>  The two are very different though they can have a few of the same symptoms..... check wikipedia, it has a good description of both....|`|NrrIDQlIaa	most debilitating depends on the person both can be very debilitating diseases or people can also function fairly well as well...highest rate of suicide is said to be higher in bipolar but i dont know the statistics for suicide and for people claiming a mental illness seem to never be quite right so i have no idea which ones actually 'worse' according to this question anyhow...easier one to treat i would say is bipolar, and easier to find treatment for is bipolar...there are actually much fewer therapists that specialize in borderline and even a lot of psychiatrists wont even treat you if youre borderline since theyre not specialized in that field even tho that matters with no other mental illness...its annoying...|`|94NYYq5Haa	both disorders can range in severity.  It depends.  Most clinicians would say bipolar is easier to treat because standard treatment includes a cocktail of medications.  However, it's just not that simple.  Traditionally, therapist dread working with borderline patients.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	it depends on the severity of the case.<br>  it's easiest to treat bipolar disorder because medication can solve it, though it's hard to distiguish bipolar disorder from depression.  so a lot of times bipolar patients end up with the wrong medication.  as for borderline personality disorder, well, it's harder to treat because you can't take meds for the disorder itself, so it can only be cured by therapy and medications for some of the severe issues that may come with it, like depression.<br>  <br>  i don't know about suicide rates, though.

Can I call ya double D? Here's the thing:<br>  <br>  If you like looking at other men...and enjoy lookin at their peepee, that may mean that you are experiencing homosexual urges. HOWEVER, ...double D, this can also just be a...thiiinnggg. I iunno. It dun necessarily mean you're gay just because you're attracted to a guy. I think a lot of girls are pretty and say "If i were a guy id totally tap that." But see how I said the word 'totally', that means I'm still straight, haha, im just kidding there that was just for fun, LMAO.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Dan D, what I'm getting at is that you can be attracted to a guy and still be straight. Are you still attracted to females? Do you fantasize about females? About males? It'll come to you. You could be bisexual. But don't be ashamed of whatever you prefer...only ya might just wanna hold back a bit on the staring cuz yeah those guys who AREN'T attracted to other men..they don't appreciate that so much, as you have already experienced noting the adjustment of your tinkle area. Ya never know. It could just be a stage that you have to overcome. Or you may have a permanent attraction.<br>  <br>  Anywho. In the end, it doesn't matter.

I care.<br>  <br>  I have thought about it (cutting myself) too, but you should be honest with yourself.  You want attention.  You possibly hate yourself... or at least don't have a healthy sense of self-respect or self-worth.  You want it to be secret, but you don't.  You like to do it because it hurts you and it feels good to binge on sadness, pain, and even anger at times.  You want help, but you don't want help.  You like the feeling it gives you, and you like the feeling you get when you ask for help in a privately public place like this.  You have a delicate ego.  You have false pride.  Be aware that getting help will require you to put that false pride away, and won't get you as much of the kind of attention you crave.  But, you should get help for this anyway.  Don't make it a big to do.  Don't talk about it alot.  Just get through the real issues, and then you won't need this anymore.  You are special for other reasons.  Good reasons.  Hating/hurting yourself doesn't make you special at all.

f18489e4ac64118394294095ba8665dcaa	Consider a fire.  If you put logs on it at night - over the night, it slowly burns through what is there - when you wake up, if you don't bother to put more wood on the fire, it goes out. <br>  <br>  This is your metabolism.  You must consistently provide fuel for your body.  If you stop putting in fuel, the metabolism slows down - it's a protection measure your body utilizes if it thinks it's starving.  The result, unfortunately, is that by skipping meals, you have the exact opposite effect you are looking for .  Your body holds onto the fat that's there even HARDER. <br>  <br>  I disagree with the special K suggestion - I would suggest a high protien breakfast.  It will make you feel more full, for a longer time, as it takes your body longer to process protien.  <br>  <br>  Consider this idea - eat like a king for breakfast, a prince for lunch, and a pauper for dinner.  It will provide energy you need while helping you reach your goal of being healthier. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fnmViEXaaa	You burn more fat throughout the day than at night. So, if you eat something healthy (like Special K with a banana and fat-free milk) at breakfast, you will have more energy, added vitamins and a faster metobolism. Even a healthy breakfast bar or OJ is better than nothing. Keep your metabolism going!|`|YXOnGg8Kaa	Breakfast  stands for Break the fast because while you are sleeping your body in a fasting mode and when you wake up you need to break the fast by eating something so it starts up your metoblisim and you burn more calories thru out the day|`|hiuY3yrUaa	It is definitely better to eat breakfast if you are concerned about your health and want to prevent or lose fat in your body.  It's true that when you skip meals your body thinks it's starving so it starts to hold on to fat deposits.  If you only want to eat three times a day then the advice to eat like a king, prince, then pauper is accurate.<br>  <br>  But you may find you aren't hungry enough in the morning to eat a big breakfast.  Or (like myself) they wake up with just barely enough time to get to class or work.  Many people find success in eating 5 or 6 smaller meals a day.  The key here is to make sure you aren't eating regular portions each meal but actually reduce your intake so that these smaller meals equals what you would get from three standard meals.
TsjqzanQaa	Male circumcision, like female circumcision, is genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  In male circumcision, the foreskin is amputated.<br>  <br>  The foreskin of the male is an inherent part of the penis, it's a sleeve of skin that covers the glans, or head of the penis, and can be retracted, or pulled back like the sleeve of a shirt.       It's not excess skin, but is a normal part of a complete and natural penis.<br>  <br>  The purpose of the foreskin is to protect the glans, and keep it moist and sensitive.      The foreskin also has Langerhans cells, a fairly recent discovery, that have antiviral and antibacterial properties.   This is one of the reasons that uncircumcised men have a lower rate of HIv infection and also a slightly lower rate of STDs.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is one of the most sensitive parts of the male body, and has thousands of nerve endings.      The inner foreskin is mucosal, and is what keeps the tissues smooth, sensitive and moist.<br>  <br>  The smoother texture of the intact, uncircumcised male is less abrasive to the walls of the vagina, and the motion of the foreskin during sexual activity also is less abrasive and more enjoyable for both partners.<br>  <br>  The foreskin also provides more enjoyment for the male in masturbation.<br>  <br>  Doctors make money from circumcision.     They also very frequently belong to the religions that try to mutilate all males by circumcision, and are highly biased.     Doctors do not disclose the adverse effects and complications that result from circumision, and in fact suppress them.<br>  <br>  Circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.    <br>  <br>  The foreskin, with its thousands of nerve endings is amputated.    Other nerves and nerve endings remaining on the penis are permanently damaged.      Veins, capillaries and blood vessels are severed, permanently disrupting the normal penile blood flow.<br>  <br>  Scar tissue is formed.      Finally, the exposed glans and surrounding tissues, meant by nature to be covered by the foreskin dry out and keratinize, and all of the above factors combine to reduce sexual sensitivity by an average of 50-75% and more in come cases.<br>  <br>  The keratinization is continued throughout the victim's lifetime, slowly an inexorably reducing sexual sensitivity even more.<br>  <br>  Obviously, a complete and natural penis with a foreskin feels and functions better than one made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.<br>  <br>  There are old wive's tales and outright lies about the so-called benefits of circumcision, but these have all been disproven.     Most of the world leave their males unmutilated, but people in the USA have been more gullible, and the medical profession has done just about everything that they can to spread the scourge of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, more people are realizing that it's abnormal and unnatural, let alone cruel and barbaric to amputate (usually without painkillers!!) the most sensitive part of an infant male's body.<br>  <br>  This practice, like female circumcision of minors, should be illegal, as it's unbelievably cruel and disfiguring.       You can look at one of the videos on the internet of an infant being mutilated, and it'll turn your stomach.      Animals are treated better than that in the USA.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	No its cutting off the foreskin that coveres the tip of the penis.<br>  <br>  I don't know, I have been asking myself that question ever since I found out I was circumcised.<br>  There is no reason to do it.

They did it at puberty - it was painful and was supposed to make you into a man.  Jews and Muslims copied these ancient tribes that did this.<br>  <br>  Today , only 20% of the world's men are circumcised.  Most of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision began in the late 1800's to stop boys from masturbating among other silly reasons.  This only happened in English speaking countries.  Most countries have never circumcised.  Circumcision was never that popular in Britain and had died out by 1950.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.  In Canada and Australia it died out in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% of boys are circumcised in these 2 countries.  The USA is the only place it is really done.  Though the rate has declined recently to about 55%.  You can see a full history here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=5&id=70&Itemid=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/ind...</a> <br>  <br>  There are no medical reasons to circumcise.  Though a lot of the old myths still persuade new parents to perform this damaging operation.

With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  This is why some boys have to get it done later.  If parents follow the correct advice - do nothing - then like in other countries that do not circumcise, it never has to be done later.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  the glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.

Nothing says you can't order an appetizer - and lots of restaraunts have veggie side dishes.  Get salads and veggies when you can.  Get appetizers other times.  And - there are PLENTY of ways to excercise without leaving the house - walk around the house...do sit ups...yoga...  Mostly, plan what you will do when you get back so that you have a gameplan to lose any weight you do gain (10 days is not that much) - that will give you more confidence.  A lot depends on how you are as an eater...  If going out is fun for you and you enjoy trying new things, it can be hard to say no to the interesting, higher fat foods...but if you are just going along to be with the person then try to eat skinny...smile.<br>  <br>  One more quick idea - if possible...suggest food courts or places near malls or parks to eat - then offer a walk after the meal...why not?  Refreshing change to sitting around watching movies or whatever...and promotes quality time together.  :)|`|023d407310e7a69690f198b62115be63aa	just try to balance out what you order. if you get a burger one night, take a break and have a salad the next. also, try to order more water than sodas because the soda adds additional carbs. as long as you try to balance your meals out, you should be fine.|`|Hmn5XOJCaa	Dont get anything fried(or keep it to a real minimum)<br>  Choose rice or veggies over fries or mashed potatoes. Ask for sauces and butters onthe side and apply as little as youll need. Always ask if theres a suger free or fat free option. Egg white only, no yolks, no red meat. No cheese. Try to get things baked bc food that is sauted and grilled involves grease or oil. Dont get stuffed fish, onyl the filet and actually spicey food fills you up faster. Park the car further from the resteraunts and theres always time for a little excrecise. Do 20 squats here or here, dosnet even take a full minute or get down and do 10 crunches throughout the day, even ONCE a day is better than nothing. Jog in place for a little. You may not get to doa  whole 30 minute workout but do something. Also, I used Trimspa to curb my appetite when I was losing works great!

uNZfdNinaa	there are a lot of reasons why people cut. whether its a "real" reason or an attention-seeking reason its nothing to judge a person on or make them feel bad about. its very serious and can make a turn for the worse if people are insensitive about it. I've had a lot of friends who cut for a lot of years. all of which had different reasons for doing so. but it never made me think of them differently. instead i knew i wanted to help them. people who cut don't want your pity. most of the time they don't even want people to know they do it. what ever the case is calling it attention-seeking and stupid makes its all worse.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	it depends on the reason in which they do so.|`|LBbKmemxaa	I feel like they should MAN-UP and cut their hands off FOR REAL.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	these days, i think cutting can be a "fad" behavior, but not in most cases.<br>  <br>  cutting is a sign of unresolved emotional issues... things which have not been attended to... cutting is a release.  <br>  <br>  cutters are usually depressed.<br>  <br>  statistics say that many cutters were abused in some way (usually sexually as younger children).<br>  <br>  You can find good information on this subject by doing a yahoo search for SELF-INJURY|`|rSOGwYzcaa	I self harmed for 3 years after my dad died.

I burned my arms all over last march and i had to where long sleeves all summer. the scars are still there 2day . no one person asked for what what u and i have. living with this is very hard esp. when those around u dont have a clue ro understand what u are going thru. they never ever will. if u try to make others see the world in your eyes, you will only hurt yourself. i was abused and ridiculed too so i know how it all feels to be an outcast. it is very difficult to go thru alone. most communities offer free psychological services in every state. people just dont know about it. look it up on the internet, there should be centers in your area that will service you for free or based on income. they give u free meds too. i dont take meds but i am suffering from it now that i am in deep therapy. but u may be different. mental health services are low cost or free because there are so many people suffering just like u and me. look it up .|`|nCNsiblPaa	Well i cut myself and the reason i do it is because i get soo angry i wanna break something but if i do ill get in trouble soo i cant get in trouble for destroying my arm., i also do it when im anxious. its very to stop when u have bad day u have bad days.|`|vauozgLgaa	I'm not really sure?

You essentially drink lemonade all day and take no solid food (read the book or instructions - this is not your run-of-the-mill sugary lemonade). I'm loosing about a pound a day. The diet is recommended for 40 days (to achieve maximum health and immune-strengthening benefits); 10 days minimum. I don't feel hungry.

ntPvdl1paa	Hi. The best advice would be to lose fat at a casual pace, say at 2lb per week. Anything more than that and it becomes highly likely that the body will be resorting to using muscle as an energy source.  Also, avoid making drastic cuts to your daily energy intake, as it will cause your body to go into a state of shock and actually make it harder for you to lose fat in the long term. Try upping your protein content and incorporating some resistance training into your fitness regimen. This does not guarantee some of your weight loss will be muscle loss, however, it sort of minimizes the chance.  Also, I highly recommend supplements such as L-glutamine, which is supposed to be anti-catabolic. It's great to use for those wishing to cut fat while maintaining lean muscle mass. I've been using it myself and it's been great.|`|aea1da7b2544e7966d7e75a1c52acc72aa	cardio exercise, like walking or jogging, would be good. try and do some every day so you'll lose the fat, and maybe two days a week do some strength training. if you lift some light weights you'll stay toned and not build too much muscle, and the cardio exercise will get rid of the fat.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|27d84fe4ef59a605fe5fb25164f4fe97aa	you probably can't bench as much since you stopped benching altogether?

It's best not to wait on these things since 1) you're not comfortable and 2) some STDs, actually the majority, can cause infertility if left untreated.  If you're not comfortable going to your regular physician, go to a hospital, clinic or another doctor.  But do get yourself seen ASAP.|`|AA11791214	You may have a urinary tract infection...<br>  When i was younger i used to get them all the time, and once it turned into a kidney infection, so you need to be careful, and make sure to go to the DR as soon as possible... <br>  <br>  here's some info about UTI's... Hope it helps:)<br>  <br>  The urinary tract is the body's filtering system for removal of liquid wastes. Women are especially susceptible to bacteria which may invade the urinary tract and multiply resulting in infection. <br>  Although most urinary tract infections or UTIs are not serious, they are painful. Approximately fity percent of all women will have at least one UTI in her lifetime with many women having several infections throughout their lifetime. Fortunately, these infections are easily treated with antibiotics that cause the symptoms to quickly disappear. Some women seem are more prone to repeated infections than others and for them it can be a frustrating battle. <br>  <br>  What Causes Urinary Tract Infections? <br>  <br>  The most common cause of UTI are bacteria from the bowel that live on the skin near the rectum or in the vagina which can spread and enter the urinary tract through the urethra.<br>  Once these bacteria enter the urethra they travel upwards causing infection in the bladder and sometimes other parts of the urinary tract. <br>  Sexual intercourse is a common cause of urinary tract infections because the female anatomy can make women more prone to urinary tract infections. During sexual intercourse bacteria in the vaginal area is sometimes massaged into the urethra by the motion of the penis. <br>  <br>  Women who change sexual partners or begin having sexual intercourse more frequently may experience bladder or urinary tract infections more often than women in monogomus relationships. Although it is rare, some women get a urinary tract infection every time they have sex. <br>  <br>  Another cause of bladder infections or UTI is waiting too long to urinate. The bladder is a muscle that stretches to hold urine and contracts when the urine is released. Waiting very long past the time you first feel the need to urinate causes the bladder to stretch beyond its capacity which over time can weaken the bladder muscle. When the bladder is weakened it may not empty completely and some urine is left in the bladder which may increase the risk of urinary tract infection or bladder infection. <br>  <br>  Other factors may also increase a woman's risk of developing UTI including pregnancy, having urinary tract infections or bladder infections as a child, having past menopause, and diabetes. <br>  <br>  What are the Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections? <br>  <br>  Symptoms of UTI or bladder infection are not easy to miss and include a strong urge to urinate that cannot be delayed which is followed by a sharp pain or burning sensation in the urethra when the urine is released. Most often very little urine is released and the urine that is released may be tinged with blood. The urge to urinate recurs quickly and soreness may occur in the lower abdomen, back, or sides. <br>  <br>  This cycle may repeat itself frequently during the day or night--most people urinate about six times a day, when the need to urinate occurs more often a bladder infection should be suspected. <br>  <br>  When bacteria enters the ureters and spread to the kidneys, symptoms such as back pain, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting may occur, as well as the previous symptoms of lower urinary tract infection. <br>  <br>  Proper diagnosis is vital since these symptoms can also be caused by other problems such as infections of the vagina or vulva. Only your physician can make the distinction and make a correct diagnosis. <br>  <br>  How is Diagnosis of UTI Made? <br>  <br>  The number of bacteria and white blood cells in a urine sample is the basis for diagnosing urinary tract infections. Urine is examined under a microscope and cultured in a substance that promotes the growth of bacteria. A pelvic exam may also be necessary.<br>  What is the Treatment for Urinary Tract Infections? <br>  Antibiotics are the usual treatment for bladder infections and other urinary tract infections. Seven to ten days of antibiotics is usually required although some infections may require only a single dose of antibiotics. <br>  <br>  It's important that all antibiotics are taken as prescribed. Antibiotics should not be discontinued before the full course of antibiotic treatment is complete. Symptoms may disappear soon after beginning antibiotic treatment. However, if antibiotics are quit early the infection may still be present and recur. <br>  <br>  Another urine test may be ordered about a week after completing treatment to be sure the infection is cured.<br>  <br>  Tips for Preventing Urinary Tract Infections<br>  <br>  The most important tip to prevent urinary tract infections, bladder infections, and kidney infections is to practice good personal hygiene.<br>  Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement or urination, and wash the skin around and between the rectum and vagina daily. Washing before and after sexual intercourse may also decrease a woman's risk of UTI. <br>  Drinking plenty of fluids (water) each day will help flush bacterium out of the urinary system and emptying the bladder as soon as the urge to urinate occurs may also help to decrease the risk of bladder infection or UTI. Some physicians recommend urinating before and after sex as well as a mean of flushing out any bacteria that may enter the urethra during sexual intercourse. <br>  Vitamin C makes the urine acidic and helps to reduce the number of potentially harmful bacteria in the urinary tract system. <br>  Wear only panties with a cotton crotch--cotton allows moisture to escape whereas other materials may trap moisture and create a potential breeding ground for bacteria. <br>  Cranberry juice often helps to reduce frequency of bladder infections. Cranberry supplements are available over-the-counter and many women find they work amazingly quickly when an UTI has occurred, however, a physician's diagnosis is still necessary even if cranberry juice or herbals reduce pain or symptoms. <br>  If you experience frequent urinary tract infections changing sexual positions that cause less friction on the urethra may help. Some physicians prescribe an antibiotic to be taken immediately following sex for women who tend to have frequent UTIs. <br>  Things to Remember... <br>  <br>  Although urinary tract infections are common and distinctly painful they are usually easy to treat once properly diagnosed and only last a few days. When treated promptly and properly urinary tract infections are rarely serious.|`|ca02ef42e638eed47881935f3e7b87efaa	You may have a urinary tract infection. Make an appointment to see a doctor.

Remember, fat takes up less space than muscle, so even though your thighs feel harder after squats, they are actually smaller and take up less space.<br>  <br>  I did the master cleanser, and it "works."  You do lose weight primarily because you are on reduced calories and, in addition to weight loss, you do some cleaning of your system because your intestines and colon get a much needed chance to rest.  My experience though, is that after about the second day or so, I was no longer hungry, but by about the 6th day, I started to get heart palpitations, which some people get when they are on liquid diets.  So you have to be careful.  Also, if you are doing the master cleanse for weight loss, my experience is that the weight came right back when I went back to eating normal foods.  So, I think that while it does "work" you should be careful when using it.  Good luck!|`|1c84924f05aa07297be779e3bb59286daa	Lemonade detox?

They said they felt better and didn't have the sugar and bread cravings that they had before, they even lost some weight.  I started out slowly by eating breakfast and lunch, then after 4p.m. all I drank was the lemonade.  I did this for about 3 days, and I think I lost about 5 lbs.  I also had less phlegm in my system.  I noticed that when I eat dairy I end up with mucus build up, but when I drank the lemonade, even if I ate dairy I didn't have as much of a problem.  I haven't done it exactly the way it says yet, but it still helped.  The taste of the lemonade is different so it may take some getting used to.

3Gq8lUukaa	they use both in weight loss pills dude you should read lables before you do anything|`|TFhLdk70aa	Dont bother taking either. If you want to loose weight you need to get your fat *** on a tread mill and run. If after 6 months you need something to push you past a plateou then get thermorexin or some other good fat burner.<br>  <br>  In reality, people get pumped up about results from the magic pill that they forget that its JUST A SUPPLEMENT and not the holy grail for their fat problem. If you are serious then see results 100% naturaly through sweat, effort and will power. <br>  <br>  For example. Do this for 4 months. If you are phsycialy in shape to run FAST. Start 4 times per week. Run 1 mile but each time you go strive to decrease the time it takes you to complete it. Doesn't matter if you have to walk then run again. Finish it as fast as you can. Strive for a sub 6 minute mile, although that is a HEFTY HEFTY number its always good to strive for a HIGH goal. See what you do when you structure your workout around a FUNCTION is that you forget that your there to loose weight, instead you focus on beating your previuos time and before you know it your ripped. But the real bonus is that you can out run most people at that point without effort. You can do whatever you like, but have your physicque follow a function, since its easier to stay commited and track progress.

Plus, how many calories are you getting daily from this diet. If it is under 1,200, you might want to change your game plan... especially if you are going to be exercising so much. Seriously. You will want to add a lot more protein to help you to tone your muscles and to encourage new muscle growth. What you are proposing is going to eat away at your muscles, and you are going to be dead tired by the third day. You might start losing your hair, too, if you are not so lucky.<br>  <br>  Why don't you go see a registered nutritionist to help you to plan a HEALTHY diet.

These types of food cause a spike in your blood sugar and then follow with a crash (i.e. your afternoon slump).  <br>  <br>  Try eating foods high in fiber and whole grains along with some protein for lunch.

UNdjfsoCaa	Generally, lifting weights does make things feel lighter.  There are a couple of reasons why the monitors and computers could feel just as heavy:<br>  <br>  1 It depends on how much weight you're lifting.  If you're lifting less than they weigh, they would feel just as heavy.<br>  <br>  2 Your muscles are tired from lifting.  I live in a 3rd floor apartment and have to climb 3 flights of stairs with groceries, cases of water, etc...  This is normally not a problem, but some days it's a little difficult, particularly on a day when I've trained biceps.  That case of water feels a lot heavier if my biceps are already fatigued.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on starting a lifting program and making progress!|`|e6d934a5ae439183c7827bcc4363fc46aa	I think its great how you are working out for so long and have your mind on it maybe you just arnt used to the Angle of the computer when you pick it up to move it...But i think your on a roll keep working about and eat healthy and i bet you could lift the whole desk instead of the stuff on it ;)|`|AA11127135	Your question involves the principle of specificity.  As you lift weights, your body adapts by recruiting more muscles to perform certain tasks.  That is why you can increase weight at the gym.  Also, you probably don't see time at the gym as work.  When you constantly lift objects at work, your muscles can get tired.  Also, you probably don't want to be at work (like the rest of us) and when you lift objects, you have to.  This is also a psychological difference.  Hope this helps. . .|`|AA11641218	Its work, nothing about it is going to feel better no matter what you do.

Also you may need to push yourself harder to see results.|`|d6311045132ba498b8c309138276e102aa	If you lifted a 50 pound object before you started working out, and lifted it again after working out for several months, it is still 50 pounds, and you have to exert the same amount of force and work to lift it. However, since you would be stronger, you should be able to lift it easier, though it should still feel like it weighs the same (since it does). Being stronger doesn't make objects weigh less, just allows you to lift heavier things.
ntPvdl1paa	Hey dude. The workout regimen you've outlined seems to make pretty good sense to me. Your protein intake also seems to be in check.  One thing you didn't talk about is how many carbs you're taking in daily. Since you're only 17, and you're probably doing some fairly intense workouts, are you getting enough carbs?.  I'm big on "good" carbs like brown rice, potatoes, etc - as they give me the energy I need to really hit it hard at the gym.  I haven't tried N.O Explode, but I've heard it's pretty good.  You might also want to consider taking L-Glutamine as a supplement. Ask about it at the nutrition store. You might even be able to get the stuff at a Wal-Mart or Target or somthing.  It's great for building and retaining muscle. Works wonders for me.  But anyways, it sounds like you're on the right track. Keep motivated, and keep pushing and lifting harder!  -- Andrew

CMjaetb0aa	You will lose some, but its not likely that you've gained a huge amount of muscle in 2 months anyway. Within 48 hrs your body will begin using muscle for fuel. Heres what you do: bring your supplements as you have no idea what the food will be like.

AA11400648	In an elective abortion (where the pregnant woman chooses to end the pregnancy) there are a few ways to go about it. The first method involves taking a pill. This is only used in early pregnancy (in the first month or two). The fetus (baby) comes out through the vagina in the form of a really heavy period. The second method involves applying a vaccum pump to "suck" out the fetus (baby). This tends to be a bit more  painful, but they can give the woman medication to dull the pain. It is used in more advanced pregnancy. Afterwards, the doctor  may have to scrape the lining of the woman's uterus (womb) to make sure that all the tissue is removed. <br>  For further advice, it would be a really good idea to contact one of the local crisis pregnancy centers. There is usually one  in every community, and the services they offer are low cost or free. You just have to be careful of which one you choose. Some crisis pregnancy centers are against abortion, so they may not even  present that as a choice.|`|b082783fdd2633a5141051c2a036b36daa	they use a vacuum to take it out they put it up inside the mother and suck the baby out, i have seen pictures of it, never had it done my self

However, it does motivate you to not smoke because you will feel miserable, so I guess it depends on the person. There's also a pill called welbutrin, I took that too, and it worked a little better, rather then giving you a crappy alternative to smoking i noticed there were no real cravings for nicotine.

Starches easily digest to sugar, so rice is typically bad for a diabetic.<br>  <br>  Many people substitute pastas (like couscous) for rice, but pastas are made with wheat flour, which is ALSO bad.<br>  <br>  the diabetic must avoid breads, pastas, rice, corn, and potatoes|`|bmWKETgWaa	Both kinds of rice contain the same amount of carbohydrate, but brown rice has a lower "glycemic index".  This is a number which tells how rapidly a carbohydrate-containing food is metabolized into glucose in the blood stream.<br>  <br>  A high-index food makes blood sugar values spike rapidly, while a lower-index food makes them rise more slowly and evenly.  There is a lot of information about this on the Internet, including glycemic-index tables.  Not all of these tables are in agreement with one another, however.<br>  <br>  There is ongoing discussion about how much it's necessary to emphasize low-index foods.  Some people need a quick boost in their blood sugar, if for example they wake up in the morning, test, and find that their level is very low.    Some athletes need quick energy.  Other people who don't want their blood sugar to rapidly go high will do better with low-index foods.|`|0e1c82c3e51c8fc7239168c6e717e201aa	Weather it is brown rice or white rice, both contains same carbohydrates. the thing is brown rice contains more vitamins[B5] and fibre.

In the Bible God was not upset because he put his sperm on the ground, he was upset because God ordered him to impregnate his brothers wife and he refused, thus ejaculating on the ground. It has nothing at all to do with Masturbation.<br>  <br>  The only correlation masturbation has to being a sin in the Bible, is that of lustful thoughts. It talks about coveting another person and having lustful thoughts. It is hard to masturbate without thinking of someone else or lustful thoughts. That is the only viable argument for masturbation being a sin. However, the Bible is quite understanding of human nature.<br>  <br>  That being said, if she isn't using porn to masturbate don't worry about it. If she is using porn that is a different matter that you and her need to discuss. Porn definately brings about a different aspect to things.<br>  <br>  Also, once you get married do not expect her or anyone to stop masturbating. Masturbating has nothing to do with being in a relationship or not. It is something we do.<br>  <br>  If you are truly concerned for her you should talk to your pastor and her not people on Yahoo Answers about it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't believe she is doing anything wrong. <br>  <br>  It isn't up to you to "keep her from doing it". You can talk to her about it and tell her it makes you concerned. Have a conversation about it but I would highly recommend not scolding her or telling her what to do.|`|PVoBHVRXaa	Masturbation is not a sin.

No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.<br>  <br>  But wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note-- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you. So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.<br>  <br>  So it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just like the rat.

Instead of eating 3 or more large meals, eat 5-7 small ones so you dont have to constantly eat big meals but just make a small plate of food and thats it for each little meal. do sit-ups, push-ups, jumping jacks, lay on your back flat and bearly lift your legs up but to where they are not touching the ground. And also try your hardest to exercise RIGHT before a meal that you want to eat a little bigger bigger like on the holidays- but not very much more! This helps your metabolism get going faster for a while. and after a few weeks if you keep this all up than you would of lost atleast 15 pounds, but it DOES depend on your body type.

In the form of 2 days on 1 day off 2 days on 2 days off.....this should give you good amount of rest to recover.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take in at least 1x g of protein per lb of body weight and eat lots and lots of good healthy food. <br>  <br>  If you notice your body fat rising up add in some cardio to keep it in check.<br>  <br>  Key is to aggresively increase weight at which the workouts are performed, to  keep your workouts below 45 minutes and to work out as intense and as hard as you possibly can!<br>  <br>  Later!|`|OjNHMwmiaa	Hello,<br>  I have some useful slimming product that want to introduce you.

KTBNf9meaa	Depending on how long you've been smoking depends on how long it takes to get out of your system. I smoke almost everyday so if I suddenly stopped it would take me about a month to get all of it out of my system. If you just smoked like one bowl or so you should be fine just drink LOTS of water, to help you urinate more. The more you smoke the longer it takes to get out of your system. Also forget these guys I'm in a job where they fire upon testing positive. But I've never been complained against and I go to work high all the time. Since you are small you should be ok, just drink a lot of water. Good luck.|`|9pyWRpoLaa	look into algae destroyer but first think about why your job is less than important than fun! second find out if they (your job) has a zero tolerance policy, if you live in a state that has legal medical m you might try to say (since it's only the second time) your small level of thc could be the result of being in the company of people who are legal to smoke i think 00.5 is passing unless they have the for mentioned zero policy. but really the best way is to not indulge for 100% safety god luck to you,should do it tuesday though! i believe my friend said it worked within 2 hours.|`|p4UQicV8aa	This happened to me except I had 2 weeks warning.

If you knew they would test at some time, you have only yourself to blame.

nUds76i4aa	First of all, it’s great to hear that you have one of those too-good-to-be-true-o-meters. ;) Sad to say, but a lot of folks don't and fall for the get rich quick schemes without thoroughly researching the “golden opportunity” at hand.<br>  <br>  I’ll give you my own “is ViSalus a Scam? – answered from a marketing and PR perspective” after the research I’ve done…<br>  The company has negative ‘propaganda’ that was most active in April and May of 06, upon their launch, but they continue to innovate with the launch of Neuro Smart Energy in ‘07 (which has tremendous marketability based on the unique formulation of DMAE or “brain food”) the launch of their Trim Slim Shape? Weight Management System in ’08 and, now in ’09, they have just launched their social networking community called Vi-Net to support these products (which seem pretty comparable in ingredient comparisons from their website). That’s indicator number one that ViSalus is not a scam. After 3 years of being slandered on notorious forums like scam.com, they continue to innovate and haven’t fallen by the wayside – or been indicted - which speaks volumes in this economy.<br>  <br>  They have partnered with BLYTH, a successful publicly traded corporation and  home expressions company in the direct sales arena. I wouldn’t think BLTH would jeopardize their shareholders, brand and assets unless they had made an extremely educated decision in answering that question for themselves before finalizing the strategic partnership, “Is ViSalus a Scam?” Indicator number two.<br>  <br>  The final indicator that has convinced me personally that ViSalus isn’t a scam is that the ViSalus CEO, Ryan Blair, is someone regarded highly in the media – especially on CNBC and the Big Idea with Ronny Deutch where he was featured as a multi-million dollar serial entrepreneur in showing America how to become successful quickly. Now I’m pretty sure that with all these news organizations promoting Ryan’s success and legacy, that they would have done their due diligence in finding out, “is ViSalus a scam?” It would be a PR nightmare for them if there were people being scammed by ViSalus with Ryan Blair at the helm so I’m sure if there ever was the possibility of ViSalus being a scam, they (the media, CNBC etc..) would be the first one’s to broadcast it on a national scale just to cover their mess up in promoting a fraud – which I don’t foresee happening.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision because that is of course entirely up to you after you have reviewed all resources for yourself. In my opinion, based on this research ViSalus is NOT a scam. One last word of advice, don’t let these videos from MLM marketers who aren’t even involved with ViSalus, and just spam their video titles with (scam) for controversy to drive traffic and peddle their wares, waste your time.<br>  <br>  I’ll leave you with this…what impresses me most is that ViSalus is proactive in giving back to the community. I came across their profile on a new charity network called Make the Difference Network or MTDN. Anyone who gives back to the community and charitable organizations in this economy is A-OK in my book.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and hope it helped!|`|bqxTMWaDaa	Many people have been culturally conditioned to be negative so that, when something good comes along, they cannot understand or accept it.  They'll spin their wheels and precious energy looking for a reason not to see a true benefit or step in the right direction. <br>  <br>  I have been on board with ViSalus for two and a half years and have had the privilege of working side by side with some of the most courageous, visionary and forward-thinking people.  <br>  <br>  You're crazy not to look at this company.  Twenty years ago, would you have ever believed we would have company names like Yahoo and Google?  And CEO's that ride skateboards in the office (Zappo's).  <br>  <br>  Open your mind and see what is in front of you: ViSalus Sciences, a company whose time has come.|`|csBXVTLFaa	I have been down this road many times looking for a home in a home based business.  For 3 years this company has delivered of and beyond what I have expected.  When you have a billion dollar company behind you and great leadership you are well ahead of the game.  Combine that with products based on science NOT hype with patents you have a home run.  The social network aspect appeals to the masses now.  Anyone that can share very easily the Visalus message.   In my 18 years of business I have found a home!|`|3acDmBOqaa	ViSalus is a legitimate company. What I look for in any company is a strong product base. A product that can stand on its own whether network marketing is attached to it or not. This company can stand on its own. In fact that is the real opportunity here. The product is proven so now they just need to share it with everyone.<br>  <br>  I am a customer and love the product.<br>  <br>  I have colleagues that are involved in marketing the product and are enjoying a BMW as part of the comp plan.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DupNjBoyaa	NOT A SCAM.  I have unfortunately  been part of some pretty serious scams in the past 7 years and Visalus is NOT a scam.  I have known the owners for about 3 years and have watch this business grow from an idea to an international power house of a company.  If you think this is a scam then just wait about 3 years and it will be a house hold name then you'll know......<br>  <br>  Any questions call CHUCK 303-506-7132 I know MLM and will guide you to real deals including the best team in Visalus.|`|SEqdPCr2aa	I have been using the products and have gone down 2 sizes in the last 3 weeks, without dieting.  The products are wonderful, the shakes taste better than any other product out there.  The Vi-Pak has the best combination of products out there.  I have not had any joint aches, pains or stiffness since I started on the V-Pak and I noticed that after only one week.  The ViNet social network is awesome.  They are ahead of the game with this site.<br>  <br>  Those people claiming that it is a scam, have not done their homework!<br>  www.abundance.myvi.net|`|a102d998a9389be3308ccafcc18a31ccaa	It's definitely not a scam - I earned a beautiful BMW convertible in my first month.  In addition to that I earned almost 20K in income.  This company is doing everything RIGHT.   I put my friend on their weight loss program and he's lost 35lbs in about 6 weeks!  He said it's the easiest he's ever lost weight in his life.  They definitely have it all together.  I've been searching for a long time, so glad I finally found a legit company.|`|ljuRsMNYaa	My wife and I are traditional business owners in Southern California and were introduced to ViSalus about 3 years ago. My wife has been able to get off her prescription drugs for anti-depression within the first 30 days and I have been without my inhaler and allergy medicine for since about the 2nd month on the Vi-PAK. In the last 12 months we also were able to use the TrimSlimShape and lost a combined 80+ pounds. From a business model it makes perfect sense. Take great products talk to others about them them and be rewarded for doing so. It's kind of like when you walk into your bank and they ask you for referrals and when the referral opens an account you get a reward from them. And who can pass up the free BMW for just referring more and more products and helping others with their financial and health goals. We have been able to help over 125 individuals on our team qualify for the BMW program in the past 2 years. Vi-Net is great it is a one stop web surfing that has combined your Facebook, MySpace, Jenny Craig & Weight Watchers under one umbrella.|`|jBxZ6OXCaa	To answer your question, "NO", Visalus is definately not a scam.  It is however one of the most legitimate companys I've been a part of.  The products, support, and managment are all amazing!  Yes, they tend to have that "too good to be true" follow them around however, never once have I not seen them deliver what they promise.  Another look at this great company would definately be in your best interest!|`|DRvBetPgaa	ViSalus is definitely NOT a scam. It's good, not too good to be true. Some of the stuff you're seeing might be hype, but that's the industry and companies always trying to stand out. All i know is they have good products, especially the weight loss.  Not too familiar with Vi-Net, but that's what they've been talking about a lot lately. They pitch it like Facebook with a paycheck.|`|QwxCQxXSaa	Visalus is at the same stage in development that Herbalife was in 1984.

And one that gives you a FREE BMW!!!!!! Never have I seen a company where the guys that created the company actually roll up their sleeves and train you.|`|BabtIDlWaa	To put it as blunt as possible no it's not a scam. I joined 50 companies in the last three years. I recently quit them all after joining Visalus 63 days ago. Visalus has second to none patented nutritional products not to mention Vi-net which no one else has. They also have an awesome pay plan. I got my Bimmer that Visalus pays for in my first two weeks and 6 paid for Bimmers in my team within 45 days of joining.

People watch too much unsolved mysteries...|`|keC4lrYOaa	Not unless getting more healthy, making more money, and helping others do the same is considered a scam!  Sure they are still ground floor, but they are backed by Blyth, Inc, a 1.2 Billion Dollar, public company which has like 20 years of experience in Direct Selling.  I went to a ViSalus event last week and I swear there were like 30 black ViSalus BMW's parked out front!  It was ridiculous.  I heard they have had 700 people qualify for their BMW program already!  I have my family on the product and they love them, and let’s face it, who doesn’t want to make more money right now!  <br>  <br>  Here is what really irritates me though… I have invited a ton of my friends to websites like FaceBook and YouTube and I have yet to get a check for any of them!  They make Billions, but what about us to who do all the work and refer all our contacts that they advertise too!<br>  <br>  To me ViSalus ViNet is just like a FaceBook all about health and lifestyle accept ViSalus actually PAYS YOU!  I get a ViSalus check every Monday!<br>  <br>  And I met the Founders, Ryan Blair, Blake Mallen, and Nick Sarnicola and they are just normal guys with a big vision and a great team who really want to make a difference.<br>  <br>  Don’t lets any of the blogs or paid ads posted by some inet marketer who bashes ViSalus so they can sell you their book or tape sway you… those parasites who poach off  the ViSalus keywords are the real scam artists!<br>  <br>  It you want to feel better health wise, or make some extra cash, ViSalus and ViNet are definitely worth looking into...|`|JsffWlnEaa	scam
FL216QOdaa	accutane in the beginning does look a little better.. but than you do break out. its because the medicine is getting rid of all the oils and dirt that are stuck in your pores so you breakout. once that breakout ends though you will slowly see improvement and after around 5 months you will see a major difference. i pop all my pimples because if i dont i look like i dont know they are there and i hate having others stare. <br>  <br>  you always can get a dermabrasion and get rid of scars|`|NxO58UJ1aa	dude, i've heard some nasty stories about accutane and how supposedly causes brain damage and suicidal thoughts, i don' t know what to tell you other than your skin is a reflection of your anxiety. now i'm no God, but i can try to tell you how to fix that anxiety by reading Erich Fromm's 'tha art of loving', from then on, you'll have to figure out yourself.<br>  <br>  research about accutane, maybe i'm being melodramatic, but you never know? hope you'll be fine?
C4WlEbIOaa	I am in the EXACT same position as you are in.  I have been going through this since my freshman year in high school.  I got 2 ultra-sounds and they came back normal, but my hormone levels are a bit high.  And, my doctor won't tell me if I have PCOS.  But, yeah the hair part really sucks. I feel your pain.  You should ask your doctor about medication that can help the hair.  That's what I had to do.... But then pills didn't suit me, and they haven't prescribed me something new.

AA11077726	First off, make sure it isn't a sign of a heart problem or stroke.  But if you are very young, it probably isn't.  Do you remember possibly overexerting yourself during some physical activity?  Sounds like you just have some irritated soft tissue.  A deep breath probably stretches this sore area.  <br>  <br>  Try some mild pain relievers to help.  Also, take a hot shower and let the water spray you on the back for awhile.
yiEUOwK0aa	I learnt ALL about memory in College Psychology. I'm an expert ;-)<br>  <br>  In order for people to effectively remember things, and for the memory trace to be permanently stored in our long-term memory, we must throroughly ELABORATE on the meaning of information. We must store the memory trace in form of its MEANING, and we must also ASSOCIATE the thing to be remembered with memories of similar quality to enhance quick and easy access to that specific memory trace. <br>  <br>  So people who are smart, but also really forgetful in other areas, are the people who effectively MAKE SENSE of the information they learn and want to remember for a later date. However, this doesn't mean they do the same when told what time you were supposed to meet them at the cinema for a date... ;-)

AA12123587	I'm not sure about 11 but 12 and over is the following. <br>  <br>  Here are the results of a couple of studies. I trust the second study more than the first. <br>  <br>  By age, the averages found were:<br>  <br>  <br>  First Study<br>  Age.......   Size <br>  12.......    4.1" (104 mm)<br>  13.......    5.1" (130 mm)<br>  14.......    6.0" (152 mm)<br>  15.......    6.1" (155 mm)<br>  16.......    6.3" (160 mm)<br>  17.......    6.5" (165 mm)<br>  18.......    6.4" (163 mm)<br>  19.......    6.2" (157 mm)<br>  20.......    6.2" (157 mm)<br>  <br>  Second Study<br>  Age....... **Erect Length (inches & centimeters)<br>  11.......    3.0" (3 and 0/16ths")  7.5 cm<br>  12.......    3.8" (3 and 13/16ths")  9.6 cm<br>  13.......    4.8" (4 and 13/16ths")  12.3 cm<br>  14.......    5.4" (5 and 6/16ths")  13.6 cm<br>  15.......    5.6" (5 and 10/16ths")  14.3 cm<br>  16.......    5.7" (5 and 11/16ths")  14.5 cm<br>  17.......    5.8" (5 and 13/16ths")  14.8 cm<br>  18.......    5.8" (5 and 13/16ths")  14.8 cm<br>  19+.......   5.9" (5 and 14/16ths")  14.9 cm<br>  ** Some inch rulers use sixteenths (16th) increments rather than tenths. <br>  Top numbers are inches and tenths noted in decimal. Bottom numbers are inches and sixteenths noted in 16ths". You need to count how many lines there are between each inch on your ruler to determine if it measures by tenths or 16ths.<br>  <br>  Conclusions: <br>  The average adult penis size is about 6.2 inches or (157mm). It is interesting that in this study, penis size 'peaks' at age 17. Since penises do not get smaller as a male approaches age 21, it can be concluded that boys aged 16, 17, and 18 are most likely to exaggerate the size of their penises.<br>  <br>  Penis growth among teens differs widely. For a young male, trying to interpret a table of averages is not necessarily easy nor beneficial. Young men who read this may try to make comparisons with themselves and this table. We advise any concerned teen (or concerned parent) to use this table only as "average reference". Remember, when an "average measurement" is listed, that means approximately 50% of all young men are shorter than this number (and about 50% are larger). Less than 1% of males are exactly average. That means less than 1 out of 100 men will match the average number exactly. Beware that averages are actually known as "statistical means" and they are typically used in the context of medicine and statistical sciences rather than personal counseling. Nevertheless, the table can still be used as a good reference for average penis growth over time.<br>  <br>  Inches and centimeters are different. Measuring by inches is more complicated than centimeters. See explanation below the chart. <br>  <br>  The table above is a collection of measurements from doctors and pediatric physicians. They do not measure the boys' penises while they have erections. The length of the erect penis can be determined by stretching the flaccid penis from the tip as far out as it will comfortably extend. It is then measured from the tip to the base while flaccid (and still extended). The measurement is then taken for the medical records of boys who have had developmental concerns, urogenital diseases, or penis injuries. It does not take long for a group of physicians to determine averages and normal variations when they see hundreds of patients per year.|`|AA11518036	5 inched|`|AA10232591	everyone is different|`|62c989762060601f211adb4b62605c22aa	google it|`|AA10527065	about 5-6-7 inches|`|AA11496743	There is no average size for a person your age, because everyone goes through puberty at different ages.|`|AA10024039	It really just depends man, like 3-5 is normal but it just depends wheer in puberty you are it.

Don't exercise any one muscle group on two consecutive days.  There are a lot of routines but a popular routine is a Monday, Wednesday, Friday routine that works every major muscle group.  Another is a similar routine, but six days, where upper body is worked one day and lower body the next, and Sunday is an off day.  There are many variations, but the most important thing is WORK OUT.|`|1e698e5ad84cc14cb76de52fa1d7d19baa	Purchase some good books from market|`|213f160fb4b74f2d3ddcf939f2ce0edfaa	I used to do 200 sit ups a day
9e349bcf4bec12aa12c425b5348af244aa	I used to work at our local hospital and saw these "cards'...they are, at least I think the cards you are talking about.  They are with medicaid (welfare) and ONLY cover medical visits RELATED to the pregnancy. Check with your states health plan to see if that is something she is elgiable for.  I don't know of any other insurance company that offeres ins for pregnant ladies only, thou some times there are some "free clinics" that offer the ins for pregant people if the visit is related to their pregnancy|`|89bb66e5f7302152b837578dfbe1990faa	i think it's legit. my sister did not have insurance, except when she was pregnant, because the government wanted to protect the baby. once she gave birth, she was no longer covered and the child was.

They give you a round cracker the size of your hand and tomato sauce in a tube and call it a pizza. I will tell you that I used their idea of having 12 oz of skim milk with every meal and that worked for me. I eat a saucer sized portion of whatever I want and then the skim milk 4 times a day and am very full. So far I have lost 18 pounds and counting and that is without adding any exercise. Good luck with your weight loss but DON'T waste your money on NutriSystem!!
ee1c0c1d4321045630054dc29dc543a6aa	Yep.  They took out a piece of tissue there, and now scar tissue is filling it in.  It is going to feel uneven and a bit lumpy with the swelling and the new hole..etc.. So please don't worry about the biopsy site.. just continue to monitor it.
2ofTJnxfaa	gosh, when you know please let me know- i've had a partially torn hamstring tendon for over 7 months now & i am still going through physical therapy. talk to your doctor about cortozone shots, that's what i might be getting. the surgery is usually used if the tendon is completely unattached from the bone. if it is, then i would definitely consider that. YES, get a second opinion. the first doctor i went to told me it was pulled- and i was in pain for MONTHS, knowing it must be more than a pulled muscle. always get a second opinion, even a third or fourth.

If a woman's body can handle semen being in her vaginal tract and uterus, then her body will suffer no bad effects from having your semen in her stomach.  <br>  <br>  Some men like it when a woman swallows.  They view it as a form of complete acceptance.  Also, semen is a good source of protein with only ten calories per mouthful.  Just be sure that you don't eat anything sour or bitter if you want your wife to enjoy your semen.  The flavor of a man's semen is related to what he eats that day.|`|AA11016556	Why do you need other peoples opinion, or approval to decide what is "OK" for you?|`|AA12281559	If she gets off on it.|`|a48d0bc59e199b485ab8543f47a1c8c1aa	Yes, it's okay, but it would be even better if she swallowed mine!<br>  <br>  In all seriousness, you are asking this why? You don't seriously think it's an unhealthy act for your wife to indulge in, do you? If so, you're probably not mature enough to be engaged in these acts with your wife, let alone mature enough to be married with another adult.<br>  <br>  To those who are uneducated, ignorant, or just plain clueless: unless the male has some sexually transmitted disease, there is no medical reason why a woman can't or shouldn't swallow a man's semen unless she's allergic to it.<br>  <br>  That being said, a woman who doesn't know her partner's history would be well advised not only to refrain from swallowing, but to also practice safe oral sex to avoid getting in contact with that partner's sexual secretions of ANY kind.|`|b082783fdd2633a5141051c2a036b36daa	it's ok i guess|`|AA11964605	Swallowing semen is good for her.<br>  <br>  There are nutritional components in your semen as well as health building enzymes and glycoproteins (also Selenium which shows promise in preventing cancer)<br>  <br>  Semen Therapy is the practice of swallowing semen three times a week or more, to get the health benefits.|`|f84b05bdda8acdc9c46170615c8d8e13aa	ew.

8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	Is your dad willing to help you with money and place to live while you're pregnant and afterwards.That will make a big difference.Why give away your own flesh and blood baby without  a damn good reason? Do you want to keep the baby especially if you can get some help with it? Look, if 17 wasn't too young  for you guys to have sex  then 17 isn't too young to be a parent. Tell your old man to put that in his pipe and smoke it! There's always a way to do what you want to  do if you're willing to work hard and fight for what you want. Tell your dad to start acting like a grandpa who cares about his daughter and future grandchild.|`|21d1e43bcab13ed0553650014e8596e9aa	This is a very hard question to answer as it is a personal choice for you.  I personally had a baby at 19, I was too young at that age, but I did not give her up for adoption. Who knows what kind of life she may have had if I did, maybe she would have more money, or more priveledges, but I know she wouldn't have had more love.|`|a7340a076c890afa386058b2b69fc815aa	It is up to you  to decide .

I was 19 when I got pregnant with my first child and was absolutely thrilled.  Then I dumped my boyfriend and was even more thrilled!  lol.  But seriously, this is up to you.  Are you ready to give your EVERYTHING for this child?  You've got a hard road ahead of you if you do.  School is going to be hard, college and work even harder.  Is your boyfriend supportive of either decision?  Would he be willing to raise your child if you decide you don't want to?  I gotta tell you, you're in an extremelly difficult situation that only you can decide the outcome for.  If you decide not to put your baby up for adoption, I congratulate you and wish you the best.  You're child is a miracle and blessing and will become the best thing in your life.  Although, if you decide that you can't give your child the best they deserve and lean towards adoption, I still congratulate on doing what you think is best for you baby and still wish you the best.  Just remember, there are programs out there for young mothers.  Maybe you should look into them before you make your decision.|`|d60b2ed5d84ce4bd6e37b1cec230d050aa	this a difficult situation, i wouldnt give your child up for adoption, you'll never know what he/she is like, it may be a rough life at first, being so young, but im sure everything will turn out fine in the long run, i would defintely keep the child and just make the situation as best as you can..... no one can give more love to a child than there own mother|`|0948bd5a88aa2c09d8903792496cd05aaa	This is a hard one, sweetie.  I can understand your father's position and yours.  If my child came home with this I'd be very tempted to suggest they keep it but a part of me knows all too well that raising a child when your young is hard, very hard.  Not that it gets any easier with age.  A parent never stops worrying.  If this is something you're going to end up doing alone, you may want to think of your child's well being.  Check out your local chapter of Birth-right or Right to life.  At least they have trained counsellors that will talk to you and your boyfriend free of charge and they may be able to suggest some options.  <br>  Ultimately you have to sit and talk to your parents and his... if you aren't going to get their support, the world can end up being very hard on a single or young parent.  Remember though that sometime adoptive parents will be willing to allow you to remain a part of the child's life, it's rare but it does happen. Sometime the ultimate gift of love is to allow your child to have the possibilities an older loving couple can give. <br>  I can't say one is better than the other both have good points and bad.  But whatever decision you finally make, try to make it with a health attitude after you've looked at all the options.  I don't know if this helped or not but good luck.|`|6ad6b3a34a025d8efd1a2a86f4f4f684aa	Congrats on your pregnancy.  No matter what you decide, you are bringing a new life into this world.  Adoption will change your baby and your life forever.  If becoming a mother changes you, well being a birth mother will REALLY change you.  Adoption is a personal decision that only you and your boyfriend can decide.  Others might tell you what to do but they won't be the ones with the adoption grief and pain that even women with the most awesome adoptions experience for months and years after their child's adoption.  So don't let anyone else make your decision.  Look into what it would take to parent the baby and then you can decide if your baby and you would be better of if you picked adoption.  Good luck to you!|`|AA11952926	What do you and the babies Father think about it? Who says that by the time the baby gets here that you won't be ready? What is there to be ready? All the money in the world or maturity <br>  can't make one "ready" for a baby. In the long run how will this affect your life and relationships? It sounds like your dad may be the one who suggested this, not you. You and the babys' dad should make this decision.|`|a89dfd13dfe4c923b0ad5f42b6c0aca4aa	I think your father is right.You should give it up for adoption.Your father knows you better than anyone on here.and adoption is better than abortion.If you put the baby up for adoption then a family that can't have kids and can and is ready to raise a child will have a chance.Plus if you did put your baby up for adoption most families will sent you letters and pictures.

No pueden interpretarse los sue?os, porque nunca recordamos los sue?os completos. Sale!!<br>  2. Por tanto, se interpreta el contenido emocional de lo que recordamos de los sue?os y las causas por las cuales los recordamos<br>  3. Eso generalmente lo hacen los psicoanalistas<br>  4. El significado de cada símbolo representado en el contenido que recuerdas del sue?o depende de tu personalidad y de los significados que tú le asignes a tal contenido. Por tanto, el resultado de la interpretación sólo puede ser válido para ti y tu experiencia, no puede ser generalizable al resto de la gente. <br>  5. Aunque lo que sí puede generalizarse es la metodología y las correlaciones que existen entre distintos tipos de personalidad y los significados que suelen asignársele a los contenidos del sue?o<br>  Esperando no haberte complicado<br>  Me despido<br>  Saludos desde México.|`|dee73696582478c7e54acbc26ee6d19daa	Compra varios libros de interpretación de sue?os, para que tengas varias opciones para comparar el significado de un símbolo. Te puedo dar varios tips: busca el significado de lo que más te llame la atención en un sue?o, pueden ser colores, ropa, muebles, personas, lugares, etc. Eso es lo importante para interpretar un sue?o, los detalles que más recuerdes, olvida lo demás. Toma en cuenta si tu sue?o fue a color o en blanco y *****, porque tienen significados distintos. NO TOMES AL PIE DE LA LETRA LO QUE ENCUENTRES, porque nadie tiene la verdad absoluta en esto además de que se presta a charlatanería. Ya que tengas varios símbolos, busca su significado y haz una especie de rompecabezas para sacar el significado final del sue?o. Ojalá te sirva, suerte...!!!|`|200c6fe93f4d1fda474d8465459ec34faa	Valla a la libreria y alli hay muchos libros para estos que te pueden ayudar y eso de pende que tipos de sue?os  sue?as si no cuentame y te dire que se trata tu sue?o.|`|175a76c9e371848e51e6eaff5764f33baa	segun lo que se los libros no ayudan, es mejor que vallas con alguien que sepa de eso...

a4b0816eb980480ac8716ecefb9e957daa	Well you're gonna love my answer considering I don't plan on being a B$&tch :) I lost 23 lbs in 11 days doing the master cleanse. It is also referred to as the lemonade diet. I gained 7 lbs back. My jeans size went down 2 sizes and stayed that way though even with the weight gain. Since I have not overdone it but have tried to maintain somewhat of a healthy eating lifestyle. Although I do still crave Tostinos pizza (and eat it) and love anything italian! Good luck. Just type in master cleanse in google or yahoo search and you'll find everything. Oh and I also did my maple syrup in half because I was doing it for weight loss. I felt better on the detox than I have in my entire life. No hunger pains. The only craving I had was the craving to chew and taste but I wasn't actually hungry. Good luck and e-mail me with anymore questions.|`|85dd3e1a2e5f17251258499b9309d5a4aa	There is no such thing as a "quick fix" fat loss program.<br>  You can try really low calorie diets but you will end up losing muscle instead of fat which Will make you fatter in the long run.<br>  <br>  The best practice is to eat right, at the right times of the right amount of food.

It's not the detox taht's doing it (if they're actually giving you any meds or therapies), it's the lack of whatever drug/alcohol you were doing before going into detox.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  well genius, you're wrong.  You say I need to know what i'm talking about?  It's pretty clear that you're the one who has no clue.  Detox refers to a detoxifying program to get people off of substance abuce.  "detox" in the way you're referring to it is not a medical term, and frankly is just a load of crap to begin with.  Quick-fix weight loss or 'toxin' removal diets and cleansers are garbage, they don't do ANYTHING AT ALL.  There is no medical basis for any of this at all.  It's not scientific, it's commercial.  Some company tells you about all the harmful 'toxins' in our food an environment and how their product can magically get rid of them and make you so much healthier.  Well, it's a lie.<br>  <br>  Any company advocating psuedo-scientific claims like 'toxin removal' is just throwing out words with no scientific, statistical, or medical basis at all for their products and claims.

My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11813053	about 10 minutes per my doctor
ibWjO7nXaa	go to bodybuilding.com to find out about the detials.<br>  <br>  I suppose there's no chance you'll listen to me when I say you could do better money wise and results wise with a better understanding of diet and more consistency, than getting supplements. Unless you're much more experienced than anyone who would ask a question like this, that is.<br>  <br>  So on to this thing -<br>  Yes it's safe. Don't listen to the health nuts that say no, because NO explode has nothing in it except stuff you could theoretically get in food, just in pure, concentrated form, and in certain proportions. It can't affect your endocrine system, it won't put undue stress on your liver, pancreas or kidneys, you'll be fine. Those people are the same that never microwave food because they think that eating food that's been affected by radiated heat will give them cancer. It's perfectly safe once you hit age 12, from a danger standpoint.<br>  <br>  "How much water do you need to drink..."<br>  <br>  What the hell kind of question is that? You're working out and not drinking a gallon a day already? Get one gallon of water, IN A CONTAINER (not fruit which has water inside, not kool-aid with water added, not soda for christ's sake, but water) - and if you want to be real fancy like me, you'll pay 109 instead of 63 cents per gallon, on something with REVERSE OSMOSIS. Distilled is great if you're bodybuilding during the last 2 weeks, or for general health (it will help you get rid of toxins easier and free radicals [maybe]) but it's bad for people wanting rapid, dramatic results because it takes all the minerals from your body too. Reverse osmosis water is the best you can get for filtration without it robbing you of minerals, including those in your no-xplode. (is there no e? I thought it was explode. Guess not.)<br>  <br>  For the record, I can be sure that if you just added a meal of skinless chicken breast, threw some olive oil on it with everglades seasoning (or any complete meat seasoning,) it would be better for you. This product is good for competition, but i don't even know if you're a bodybuilder like me or just doing weights, or maybe not even that - they try to market this cardiovascular crap to soccer players and what not saying it'll help endurance too. That's the best advice you'll get on the subject. Knowing which supplements to take and how to balance them with your budget and your diet spending is as much as important in reaching any athletic goals (unless you're not interested in being athletic past high school; maybe genetics alone is enough to make you a big pimp at hometown usa...) as the training aspect. No-xplode... Not worth it. But looking at the nutriton, I do believe it would do SOMETHING. Just not MUCH. So go ahead and take what you've got if you've already bought it.<br>  <br>  PS- you got lucky I was on this site now on the first day of spring break. Ususally, you'll just get retarded hippies on during the day who are baked and have nothing better to do with their time; they are the microwave fiends I've mentioned before. If you've got questions, look for a big site which sells stuff. This means that they're open to lawsuits if they're not at least up to date with the medical theories, if not right about their facts. They are reliable, because if makes business sense to be reliable. Any chmuck (I spell wierd I know) on the internet? Not worth talking to. Forums? Full of morons who will never reach their potential contradicting each other. If you want to know if something works, do like I do. Spend about an hour, a full crammed hour, every day studying case reports, nutrition, yes sometimes the sports magazines on the supplements, and get a doctor that knows about this stuff (most family practitioners don't). If you're really interested in good info, go to a bodybuilding show (even if you're not a bodybuilder or otherwise interested,) and talk to the actual competitors, and the people around them - NOT the rest of the audience. I'd suggest an amature show, it's kindof hard to get time to talk with Cutler nowadays, heh. <br>  <br>  Oh, and if you do ask these guys, they know thefacts like the back of their hands. Have some IDEA before they even answer, don't just say - tell me everything about no-xplode!.... That will piss off a guy who's big, sodium and water deprived, and has had a lot of carbs for the first time in 2 weeks. Be considerate of the fact that more than one specific question is probably not what they came there to do.<br>  <br>  Take care, ~|`|IY9gqPUAaa	It says right on the label, only for adults 18+. If you have researched the proper dietary guidelines and are in a health physical state I would think you could start using the product. Be careful. Drink at least 64 oz per day plus the fluid you use to mix with the NO-xplode. Spread it out too, not all at once. This helps with absorption and decreases to chance of urinating out all the product.<br>  "Warnings: Before using product, seek advice from a health care practitioner if you are unaware of your current health condition or have any pre-existing medical condition including but not limited to: high or low blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, heart, liver or thyroid disease, anxiety, depression, seizure disorder, psychiatric disease, diabetes, pernicious anemia, difficulty urinating due to prostate enlargement or if you are taking an MAO inhibitor or any other medication. Do not use if you are pregnant, nursing, prone to dehydration or exposed to excessive heat.

Every 5 years, your implants will have to be replaced ( the dr. will not disclose that to you it's bull sh1t), you risk losing nipple sensitivity, your body could reject them. If you decide to have your implants removed, your skin is permanently stretched out..so it won't be a pretty picture. Not to mention the scars.<br>  Now a tummy tuck is a very painful procedure that will leave you with a big huge scar! Not unless you have the $ to have that removed. Because the fat is being lessened in the stomach area, it's going to start showing up in other places. <br>  Just remember one procedure does not equal perfection..it could end up making you look worse. Good Luck|`|AA11624209	Don't do either! I saw a tummy tuck on TV it is disgusting what they do. They cut away half of the skin on your stomach! Especially if you're going to have kids, you only get so much skin you know. Also, why do you need a boob job when you have plenty? It will just go all saggy. You will probably lose sensitivity, why do that?|`|b11891449865800184a8e042a33e3b28aa	As an individual I would say neither, but I am going to school for pre-med so I am speaking as a soon to be doctor. You have to understand that the tuck won't give you the stomach you see beach bodies with. Help out yourself and your surgeon, you should prep your body by doing full body lite weightlifting because it doesn't matter how thin you arei If the muscles below the skin are weak then that makes your skin somewhat unstable. Crunches among other things will help stablize your stomach region. But I would say the stomach would be first then the chest because once the stomach is flat or you appear slimmer, then your breast might seem well suited to your body and you might decide to save yourself some money and skip the implants. But if not, first you should decide what kind of implants you want. There's Silicone, saline, and double-lumen, and pvp-hydrogel which all have a different feels, functionality and all have different risk. There's also Trilucent which has Vegetable oil in it which I think should drop so health concerns but I've never seen them used. Talk it over with your Doctor and make an intelligent decision. I am not saying you should do either, I am just informing you so you can make the decision, wisely. Recovery is the hardest part of these procedures. Its long and painful and its best to have people who love you take care of you during home recovery cause its gonna be tough on them too. A good plastic surgeon can operate leaving procession stitching in his/her wake almost completely minimizing scaring but some aren't that good and some people end up looking rough. I hope the info helps. I bet your a beautiful women and society says we need to look good. Even people who say you shouldn't do it will judge other people based on looks. Just make sure your doing this for yourself and not so you can pull more numbers while club hopping, thats a short term game plan and this is anything but short term. Good luck!!  :O)|`|c5f0f96abf985426b7ff0517da4b4ff9aa	36C? that is a good size. You don't want to get anything bigger than that... it would be way too much and look fake.  As far as your belly, try doing sit ups and try to flatten it yourself.  If that doesn't work, then sure... go for it... get the tummy tuck!  If I could afford it, I would do it.  Just make sure you think about the problems/side effects that can come from the surgery and if you are willing to still go through with it, then I say more power to you!

SBS is a condition that affects new buildings almost exclusively however can affect older building that have had major renovations. SBS is caused by number one organic vapours given off by curring paints; glue and new furniture, number two inappropriate or lower than necessary fresh air flows leading a buildup of carbon dioxide from the breath and organic vapours from glues and other sources, number three low or faulty artificial lighting with very low levels of ambient natural light. These are the main causes of SBS however there are many more and if your building has SBS there is very little that can be done. You might try opening a few doors and turning the air-conditioning flows up a bit, but that will only helps if caused by one or two factors. Hope this helps.|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	could be carbon monoxide poisoning. they have pretty much the same symptoms. or its just the smell of paint and carpit and new furniture. i have trouble sitting in new school bus's because the seats smell new but i get sick and get a really bad headache. by the way doctors dont know ****|`|972c756a0dacaa8f78a3428843e01730aa	All new textures, glues, cleaning agents, possibly molds, drywalls, plasters and HVAC units means trouble.

66f55095d669712d045c790c287d2277aa	You are definitely underweight by any standard, and if you feel that you are larger than you are you may be suffering from distorted body image, possibly Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Your stomach has become accustomed to not having much food in it at any given time; this is why you feel full after eating only a small amount of food. With your caloric intake being so low, you are depriving your body of the things it needs to survive. If you feel guilty after eating, even small amounts, you are likely suffering from disordered eating, and quite possibly anorexia.<br>  <br>  It's becoming more and more common for men to have eating disorders, so you should know that you aren't a freak and you aren't alone. It's really important that you seek treatment as soon as possible, because anorexia can progress really rapidly, and take over your life completely before you even know it. There's a 'point of no return' where all your logic and value for your own life disappears... trust me that it's not worth it. Anorexia is more addictive than any drug. I recommend that you see your doctor and tell him/her what's going on and he/she will probably refer you to a specialist, who will be able to help you recover from your diseased thinking and eating patterns.<br>  <br>  Good luck in seeking treatment... if you truly suffer from disordered eating you have to stop it before it gets out of control.

Take protien bars half hour before workout and protien shake within a half hour after a workout. Don't over do yourself either. The worst thing you can do is get hurt while trying to bulk up.

Do one warm up set of 6-8 reps at one third of your normal training weight.<br>  <br>  Then do 4 working sets. Pick a weight that will just let you do 8 reps for the first set. Do that then do 3 more sets to failure.<br>  <br>  Then when you're at the stage that you can actually do three sets of 8 reps at that weight add another 10-15 pounds and start again.<br>  <br>  The only way to build strenght is to lift heavy but not so heavy you hurt yourself.<br>  Also remember to split your training with days off in between.<br>  EG:<br>  Monday  Chest - bench press and dumbell flys.

Never stretch before you do a workout stretch after your completly done with that workout then move on.no matter what u have heard streching before workout will still leave u with a pain the next day then if u was to strech afterwards.|`|AA11563286	the more you do it, the stronger you will it get. it takes time and patience. good luck.|`|d7AE0hwjaa	Train you triceps and your shoulders.  These muscles contribute primarily to the bench press.  If you really want to be stronger you should consider other compound movements like the deadlift, squat and rows.  Though they don't "target" your bench press muscles they do help you build muscle and recover quicker from workouts but encouraging your body to release more testosterone and other muscle building hormones.  Research powerlifters (those that compete in the benchpress, squat and deadlift) to find flaws in your technique.

I quit smoking at least a thousand times before I finally succeeded.  After two weeks I didn't have any cravings, but early on it was awful.  I haven't had a cigarette in 31 years and I have no more desire to smoke one than to put one in my ear.  <br>  <br>  Once I found out that nicotine was water soluble.  I had a little machine for making filter tip cigarettes.  I soaked the tobacco in water to get rid of the nicotine, and dried it.  My nicotine-free tobacco wasn't even worth bothering with in an emergency.  You can get nicotine patches, which are certainly better for your lungs than smoking, but you're still dosing yourself with nicotine, which happens to be addictive.|`|c6206b40d5e4899522260146aef60470aa	I had smoked for abot 10 years and when I decided to quit, really decided to quit, it wasn't bad at all.  Of course, I gained a bunch of weight, but hey...at least my lungs are clean!  Seriously though...I think the mental part was way more of a challenge than the cravings.  It's easy enough to aviod your smoking "spots" or change them somehow.

Then wait until you get your period again and the day before it starts is the last day. So if you got your period on Jan 1 and the next period started on Jan 29, you would have a 28 day cycle. That means you most likely ovulated on Jan 14. Sperm can live in your body for 3 days. Your "Most Dangerous" days for sex would be from the 8th to 18th days of your cycle. This is of course based on a perfect world example where you were exactly on time every month.

Good luck =)|`|d3a8750c703155a8705ebe8968df7c0caa	Honestly, the healthiest way is to go running (it's free) and count your calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein and sodium.  I'm telling you WITHOUT FAILURE it'll work.  Use the 40-30-30 method; which is 40% carbs, 30% proteins and 30% fats.  And sodium is the same for everyone which is 2,300 milligrams each day. <br>  <br>  Don't forget to drink lots of water.  Whatever your weight is, divide it by 2 and the answer will give you the amount of ounces you should drink each day.  (example 150 pound person would need 75 ounces of water each day.)  <br>  <br>  But go running, do some crunches, push-ups or whatever feels right for you.  But don't overdo it and make sure you're warming up and cooling down.  And don't forget to stretch only AFTER you finish.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless!|`|lwKIA3hjaa	The best way to lose weight:<br>  <br>  1) Why not try the zig-zag diet?<br>  It works with me and most people. Eat like normal for one day and eat a little less for three days. Make sure you burn more calories than you consumed each day.<br>  Cons: You will lose muscle & fat at the same time<br>  <br>  2) Go to sauna and do some workouts in there. I'm pretty sure that you can lose 10 pounds for two hours being inside there. Make sure you drink lots of water.<br>  Cons: You will lose most of water weight & a little bit of fat<br>  <br>  My best suggestions are: Go slow on losing weight. No need to be rush. Make it your permanent goal & not a short-term goal.

w0czI8AAaa	Dreamy,I am in my 40's and have tried EVERYTHING to reduce my pores. My dermatologist told me that it wasn't my fault. Pores are not little trap doors that open and close. No matter how much I clean,it is just the texture of my skin. You can opt for dermabrasion(I did),but, is an unpleasant procedure and rather messy  ordeal. Your skin does the ooze,crust,peel thing twice and then new fresh skin is revealed. You have to wear sunscreen and repeat process every year-year and half.  It is well worth it for me,but,if you are young,you are in for a long commitment. Whatever you choose,remember,the pores of your skin are only a small part of who you are. Don't let a insignificant thing spoil your image of who you are. You know that there is so much more to you. I spent years(and money) worrying about my skin only to find that as long as I like myself I'm way ahead of the "game" Good luck Sweetie|`|0a9f8cd1a38969c50665bc7487b588c5aa	The products I recommend to my clients are as follows. The Exfoliating Enzyme Scrub (to deep clean your skin). Then use the Pore Minimizing Toner (to close the pores). You can buy them both direct from the manufacture (it's much cheaper than buying from a salon). Just do a Yahoo search for Bee-Luscious Cosmetics. <br>  <br>  But you really need to deep clean your skin BEFORE applying the toner. Otherwise you can close the dirt and grime in the pores and that could cause more problems. I am a skincare professional.|`|ce5ce2a3f46440aa95eeaa31359c3271aa	tea tree oil|`|daec570e912ba7b1e8530d506989af05aa	you should use Srub more often on your face.. then use Skin Refinishing Lotion for treatment.. <br>  <br>  Its cheaper to get a good skincare products than seeing a skincare doctor.. <br>  <br>  Wanna good skin also need to eat more protein.. inner & outer body need to be healthy & need more nutrients|`|YOxWUBkjaa	They make a pore refining face wash that you can try.|`|942a708204289df3b7927c55a8ecd741aa	I have large pores on my face also, and I've tried just about every product out there..during the summer, with the help of the sun and some good face washes, they tighten up a bit...but really the only permanent option out there is to see a dermatologist.|`|G191Jistaa	Exfoliation, alpha hydroxy acids, and a clay based facial masque. I have large pores (and am prone to breakouts) too, but I can keep them under control by using the things listed above. My skin looks better at 34 than it did at 24. I daily use a micro-dermabrasion cloth, pimple eraser stick(glycolic acid) (Walgreen's), alpha hydrox cream, mineral makeup with SPF 19,  and Queen Helene mud masque (2x a week). It's not super expensive and it works well for me. A professional facial can help get you started, but they will want you to buy their skin care line too, if you can afford it, it's a nice thing to have, but not a necessity to having great skin.
0d47360398fbfbe302ba1e0efed96bdbaa	We do it to please our mates, and some (not much) increased sexual pleasure. You do not have to do it! And actually you'll be better off if you just shave your bikini line, you can shave as much or as little (as wide or thin) as you want to. It's all up to what is comfortable for you. The Gillette Venus razor is a good one to use for non-nicking purposes. I wouldn't use shaving cream as it is not good for clearly seeing what your doing down there, just use soap. Always remember that women are made to have hair there for a reason, it helps protect us from getting infections and such. So be mindful of what is important to you. We are not meant to look like prepubescent girls. The other thing is that when it grows out, it gets itchy and if you wear a bathing suit those little pesky "whiskers" will poke through your suit (& undies). You could also keep it trim without shaving it all off by using scissors or an eletric razor with a gaurd on it. This eleiminates the "whisker" issue.|`|eNSf7bC7aa	everyone is different but I like to shave everyday to every other day.

Take your current weight and multiply by 12--this is how many calories you need to maintain your current weight.  Then subtract 500--this is how many calories you should be getting to lose weight.  <br>  <br>  To get an accurate calorie count of the foods you are eating, you need to really pay attention to portion size.  Measure *everything* and weigh meat and fish--one serving is 4 ounces.  Most people underestimate the amounts of food they eat.  You would think that one chicken breast would be one serving, but if you weight them you will find out that they are actually 2 or 3.  So don't assume the amount you are eating is one serving...measure and weigh!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA11028702	Why can't you wear a bandage on your hand?  It doesn't have to be a stick-on type.  Have you thought about doing a wrap?  put some zinc oxide or antibiotic cream on the scab, cover the area with gauze, then tape it by going AROUND your hand with hospital tape or even duct tape, if you can't afford the other kind of tape.  If you don't want to use tape, then you can also use an ace bandage to go over the gauze or any type of a covering should work.

AA11025977	Some folk say before some say after, I think it's more what the individual is trying to do that determines timing. I like to take it before I go to the gym because I'm using it in conjunction with my breakfast ( half a cup of oatmeal and a cup of green tea, no sugar or milk ) as the fuel for the workout. I'm looking to build muscle mass and that seems to be working for me. I have read some pretty compelling arguments that after is the time because it goes directly to rebuilding torn muscle tissue. Experimenting a bit is probably the best way to go and see whats working for You. I'd say the most important part is the amount of water You drink before working out, way more important than supplemental protein. I drink one third of my daily allowance before I go to the gym and that's worked really well for me. Good luck with it!|`|88Qved6jaa	20 min before workout|`|517023f7131f0bb249c4431a7f5f8170aa	before and after.. your body needs those amino acids which is found in protein.. so when you work out your body needs to be able to get them.. the best would be to have fish or meat for lunch and work out in the afternoon.. and some protein in the morning too, maybe an egg?

Si se los suprime, el organismo aumenta su diuresis. <br>  <br>  Entonces se desciende de peso, que no es igual a adelgazar. <br>  <br>  Adelgazar es pérdida de peso a expensas de la grasa, no del agua o de las proteínas Con ella rebajas pero la mayor parte es liquido y musculo, no pierdes grasa que es lo importante. <br>  <br>  Es razonable hacerse una pregunta básica: si los músculos y el cerebro se alimentan de azúcar, de qué viven cuando se eliminan drásticamente los hidratos de carbono? <br>  <br>  En principio  de los cuerpos cetónicos que se forman en el hígado cuando las nuevas grasas, que no pueden almacenarse, se dirigen allí. El cerebro no puede esperar por alimento, así que cuando se han consumido las reservas de azúcar (y esto ocurre a la hora de no ingerir hidratos de carbono), el organismo, usando un mecanismo de salvamento y para evitar entrar en coma, utiliza los cuerpos cetónicos como energía. Pero tienen una contra: arrastran el sodio, el potasio y, con ello, el agua. La persona se deshidrata, por eso pierde peso, además, se siente débil, cansada, con mal aliento.<br>  <br>  De modo que el cerebro, finalmente, quiere azúcar. Y la única fuente de glucosa que queda son las proteínas el cuerpo tiene que consumir su propia proteína para obtener energía. Es decir, pierde su propia masa magra, se desnutre, y esto ocurre aunque tenga sobrepeso<br>  <br>  El gran problema es que pierden masa muscular hasta los órganos, entre ellos, el corazón.

The only thing you can do is lose weight all around and eventually the problem area will also improve. The way to burn fat is through a calorie restricted diet in conjunction with an exercise routine that will burn calories.

AA12319262	dats kinda small! but i think thats ok!|`|4a8723a2941488a3fef88e364558d865aa	Here we go again with another "penis length/size" question. <br>  Average is about 5 to 6 inches. Penises come in a variety of sizes. Your penis size will be the size you are given! There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the "huge" penises out there. Sure the "American thing" is "bigger is better" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given. <br>  It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the "jocks" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.<br>  And it will be fun learning the technique.<br>  And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis. Trust me, you stand a better chance this way than with any tools or toys|`|2f0ca23a25326318e27b4a573d435ed7aa	I do not understand the fascination about penis size unless you guys want to become porn star or a nude model?

LOL <br>  <br>  Anyways.....please dont take no ipobrufen....this guy was being stupid.<br>  <br>  Also no cajun food with help you either.<br>  <br>  If you genes meant for you to have small back or pancake booty then all you can do is special execises. <br>  <br>  Pick up one of the Oxygen magazines for female work outs or Glutes, which is pointed directly to your lower area work outs and get your butt to the gym. <br>  <br>  If you want to know basics without pickin up magazine then best exercises would be squads. I personally dont like to do them because they work out more of your legs then back area. So i till try to describe you my favorite ones.<br>  1: Lay on your back, bend your knees, with your feet flat on a ground. Hands behind your head or flat on a grown. And pick up your hips off the ground the further up you can go and then back up to the floor. When you do this exercise and when you lift your hips, make sure you squeeze your butt cheeks. <br>  2: Can do the same thing standing up. Squeezing your butt cheeks. Can do this exercise everywhere anytime of the day. Just make sure noone sees it, otherwise its just gon look weird. <br>  3. This one is my favorite. Stand in a doggy position, basically on your four, look forward, lift one of your legs at a time. Try to make a kick upward movement. If all you can go up is as far as creating 90 degree angle with your leg that is bent. <br>  <br>  I am not too good explaining exercises, but whats the point of giving you a name for exercise if you may not what the exercise is all about. So hopefully it was a lil clear.

Now i use a one of those womens schick quatro. 1. u dont want to use a disposable single blade razor...with the single blades sometimes instead of cutting the hair they can pull it which can cause some of the bumps (in case thats what u use) 2. do not shave for at least 20 mins after u wake up in the morning. this has to do with the oils of the skin. 3. when u hold the razor hold it firmly against the skin but do not push into the skin or b too rough. it will irritate the skin. 4. b careful what ur putting on ur legs after shaving. u may have sensitive skin and if u r using a harsh soap, or a heavily scented lotion or body wash it could also b irritating ur legs. I use olay body quench its wonderful. <br>  also b careful witht he nair. or anything that u let set on ur legs for so many mins then wash off. if it is left on too long it can actually 'eat' away the skin.<br>  I hope this has helped some.

rjcV64D2aa	There really isn't an "ideal" weight, bro. Just start squatting with 3-4 sets of 6-9 reps (every other day) and you'll find you can start increasing the weight. Do this in one of those contraptions in a gym for just in case you fall over. I do it all the time and it hurts, too. Lift to your max. and don't skimp out on it.<br>  <br>  Eat correctly, too, with a high carb diet with some protein for the muscle.|`|0vHVy2rYaa	between 130-200 if I had to guess depending on your genetics.|`|OXRJqHBnaa	The "ideal" weight would depend on a lot of factors, but let me encourage you to do this--high reps, low weight (something you can easily do 20 repetitions of without feeling muscle strain).<br>  <br>  The reason I encourage this is because at 14 you are still growing A LOT. There are plates on the ends of your long bines (ie. leg bones) called epiphysial plates. They are the plates that allow your bones to grow longer and allow you to continue to grow taller. Sometime between 18 & 25 these plates will close and you will be as tall as you are going to be.<br>  <br>  Too much *heavy* weight lifting in the early teens can accelerate the closure of the epiphysial plates and therefore discontinue your height growth.

Your individual treatment, and cost will vary from one to the next, and without a plan, it is hard to answer any of these specifics.

ls1JbwGpaa	The body will sacrifice bone calcium to keep a normal blood calcium level, so blood tests won't tell you.  You can test the bone with a DEXA scan - it's used to check for osteoporosis.<br>  Recommended daily calcium intake varies from 1000 to 1500 mg, depending upon the stage of life.  Milk products are great sources of calcium, and are fortified with vitamin D, which is necessary for the absorption of calcium.  Calcium is also found in nuts and seeds, beans, oranges, amaranth, collard greens, rutabaga, broccoli, kale, and sardines.<br>  A cup of milk has about 300g of calcium, so you need at least 4 cups of milk daily, or an equivalent total with the addition of yogurt, for example.  If you're not getting enough dietary calcium then a 500mg supplement taken with breakfast and dinner will be adequate.|`|AA11592942	in a nut shell ...... you can have a bone density scan done. very painless. trust me I wouldn't do anything painful.

Doc told me tuesday was that acidic things help with asorbing calcium. like tomato's, but they do cause havick with joints.  Viactive, or generic brand of it is one of the best supplements.

I freak out about the littlest things like moles and stuff because I'm afraid it could be cancerous.  <br>  <br>  So... I tell you these things to let you know that you are normal and that people worry about the ones that they love (and themselves).  <br>  It's only when it goes to an extreme that it is hypochondria or whatever it is for other people.  :)  Try not to think about that stuff so much, and focus on the good times that you have with people.|`|951483cfb9daff8f4880ea125371effbaa	I think you have what my wife calls "A guy thing".

It's quite common for people of all ages. What you are suffering is called "an anxiety attack". I know because the exact same thing happened to me a few years ago. <br>  <br>  The first time it happened, I just shrugged it off to being tired. But a week later it came back in triple force. There was this complete and utter sense of dread. Like something completely awful was going to happen! That was followed by a feeling that I personally was a complete screw up and would never anoint to anything! I was so overcome that I could barely make it home. <br>  <br>  Fortunately, my wife was someone I could talk to about anything. She slowly "talked me down". Right after that I went to my family doctor and he told me it was a form of anxiety attack. He gave me a prescription for a mild sedative which I took for 3 month. He told me that sometimes the brain kind of gets into a loop and feeds on it's own fears. The sedative is designed to calm the brain down and break the cycle of fears. I never had another attack!<br>  <br>  So, Daniel, if you have a very close supportive parent, sibling, or buddy open up to them in order to talk you down. Try somewhere quiet. Tell your parents about my experience and get in to see your family doctor, right away.<br>  <br>  I truly hope this helps.
AA11387869	My youngest daughter has this problem too.  I never did, but did have excruciating cramps for about three days (she doesn't).<br>  <br>  My middle daughter gets sick (like a bad cold) a few days before her period begins.  It goes away when her period comes on.<br>  <br>  My eldest daughter has extreme PMS (bad enough that she attends anger management classes) for about a week before her period begins.  This goes away when her period starts.<br>  <br>  Just keep warm gingerale and plain crackers nearby--sometimes sugary, weak tea will help the nausea as well.  Have you tried chewing on Tums or Rolaids?  That may help.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor, and see what he or she recommends.  Also you could do a web search on menstrual disorders and see what comes up.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different, and everyone's period is different.<br>  <br>  I hope that you can find a remedy for this  :)|`|2b5dd3581135b61e32cf9d6f56212bb0aa	Strange.

In the mean time try some home remedies I've used....drink hot tea, take advil not asprin or tylenol and get plenty of rest!  Good luck!

Psychologically, your need for the drug is produced by the feeling of fulfillment or discomfort from needing an artificial source. If the problem is purely medical, the drug will help as intended.<br>  <br>  If you are taking the drug so you don't have to concentrate on pleasuring your partner but still performing, you are taking it for the wrong reason.  You will likely become dependent and ultimately, the drug will do you more harm that good. It teaches you to replace real love with artificial responses that are hollow. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that sex is not about pleasure for yourself, it is pleasure for your partner. As long as you have that thought in mind, you will enjoy it, with or without the need of a drug.

IP4zVHeCaa	how often do you work out? you may be over training which can slow your gains. be sure to give yourself enough time to recover between workouts or you aren't going to grow. also it's good to vary the exercises you are doing. i used to do 3 sets flat bench, 3 sets incline and 3 sets of decline presses. that worked pretty well for me. dips, push ups, and dumbell flyes are also good excersises.|`|AA10640379	Do other chest exercises like flyes with dumbells, incline bench too. You must push yourself hard.|`|If4v9Yalaa	Instead of laying flat on a bench when doing your presses, incline it 45 degress.
rjcV64D2aa	It depends on how you workout. Make sure your doing all of your exercises with 3-4 sets or 6-8 reps. You know, like squatting, bench pressing and such. And don't workout everyday or work the same body part on two consecutive days. Muscles need time to rest and recover. <br>  <br>  Also eat a high carb meal like pasta or a bagel an hour before you workout to give you the energy you need.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're eating correctly, too. Don't think you'll gain a bunch of weight eating unhealthy, fatty things. Eat about 3000-3500cals per day with most of them (60%) coming from carbs like whole-grain products. Make sure you down about 100 grams of protein per day. And make sure your fats consist of unsaturated fats and have no saturated fats, or trans fats. Keep it down on the cholesterol and sodium as well.<br>  <br>  Being a weight-lifter, something I've been considering buying is L-Glutamine. I heard it raises you Human Growth Hormone levels a good 300% or so. People with low Human Growth Hormone levels are usually skinny, so look into that.<br>  <br>  Drink water, too! It's so important to drink a good 10+ cups of water especially if you are on a higher protein diet. It relieves stress on your kidneys that the extra protein puts on them. It also supports in every bodily function.|`|AA10232591	McDonalds for breakfast lunch and dinner EVERYDAY

I say this because I've lost 1 pounds in 4 days at a light weight class if you are gonna do it make sure you wear a good amount of sweats(2-3 layers: wear a rubber suit if ya have one)to keep in the heat and maximize you sweating. You are also gonna need to cut down on your food maybe a small salad but noooo dressing if people are telling you to drink juice there kinda wrong because the juice will have a lot sugar no matter what kind. I know all kinds of stuff will be tempting but you must resist it you need to know not to eat too much and you need to learn not to drink a lot of water, when you are using a sauna you drain yourself of all water so now your body will be retaining any water it gets<br>         Well if ya wanna gain a little muscle i would suggest taking a small protein shake it will help you lose weight while gain some muscle and you should be lifting two times a week it wont just make gain muscle if you do it right you will burn a lot of calories while you lift<br>          yeah if you do all of these things right  that weight you wanna lose should come off in no time.|`|AA10368243	It sounds like your already in pretty good shape which probably means that you have a low b.m.i, or body mass index( your ratio to heght and weight), so the best way to gain muscle while also losing weight is to invest in a sauna suit which can be found at your local department store, the sauna suit holds in body heat which will make you lose water weight.<br>  Do lots of cardio and calisthenics for weight loss. and do LITE resistance workout to put on muscle like high weight at a low repetition, otherwise your gonna put on more weight.|`|a3VaJfK2aa	Diet and workout.|`|qbqjOnELaa	DON`T DO IT ! you`re qonna lOok like a siqk person..6`2`` at 158 pounds ? i think you`re phsyco ! lol but on a serious note..i think that`z extremely danqerouss..i wouldnt recommend it =[|`|b70e721857f81c4d64abaddfa0fedaabaa	158 at 6 foot 2, you're kidding, right? Thats underweight, and I don't think you'll make a good wrestler if you're underweight. <br>  <br>  But, I can help you gain muscle, but I will not help you lose weight, because that is completely unescescary and potentially dangerous.<br>  <br>  Obviously, for wrestling, you wan't to gain strength<br>  Find the heaviest weight that you can curl 8 times. If you don't know how to do work outs, I will give you a link after to help you.<br>  <br>  You will need some weight equipment, wal-mart or a store like fitness depot can easily help you with that. <br>  <br>  Do a work out that has 5 different excerises (for one muscle group) for 3 sets. Remember you need a weight that you can curl 8 times at a maximum.<br>  <br>  An example would be: 3 sets of 8 barbell curls, 3 sets of 30 push ups, 3 sets of 10 standig barbell curls and etc<br>  <br>  You will need to be consuming alot of protein. Drink protein drinks and eat lean meats with low fat and high protein, like chicken. It is reccomended that you eat 1 gram of protein per body weight (if you are 180 pounds, you need 180 grams of protein). You can consume less and still have results, but get as much as you can, and no more then 40 grams per serving, as your body cannot absord that much that quickly. Drink lots of water to assist your body in processing it. <br>  <br>  Here is a site that will show you how to do certain work outs: <a href="http://www.leehayward.com/arms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.leehayward.com/arms.htm</a><br>  <br>  Seriously they though, don't aim to be 158 pounds at 6 foot 2, just lose the amount of weight that your coach or whoever is running the wrestling reccomends. <br>  <br>  After 3-6 weeks you will see very good results.

AA10419765	it depends what you want to tone, I'm not quite 100 lbs over weight but im far from tone. Generally if you want to tone however then you have low enough body fat that you can see muscle (which it sounds like you do) and your exercises are different that those who want to just gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  For toning you need to concentrate on form and not weight. When I get on the bench I'm training with weight so heavy that I have to push for 8 reps. You dont want to do this, you need to work the entire muscle by focusing on your form. <br>  <br>  Other than that any work out schedule that allows your body ample time to rest will work, some cardio on your off days will keep you bodyfat down too.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7KqQ1hU2aa	What  really tones up the stomach is  crunches after a while you will feel the difference.<br>  I used to be like you i thought i was fat and some times i would skip meals.I lost the weight and still called myself fat then i made my own dieting plan and lost more weight i looked at myself long and hard and i started to feel beautiful so try not to be so hard on yourself. So do some crunches or swim and burn of the fat and build up muscle.
AA10419765	Both, i can notice that i do heal quicker and feel asif my muscles have more fuel.<br>  <br>  Downsides, when you're fist loading the creatine it can upset your stomach and make you less than popular in a public restroom, but it doesnt last forever.<br>  <br>  I have found no downsides to protein, except the tastes of some of the poweders.

tlMbxgpJaa	Myth: Wearing a hat causes hair loss.<br>  <br>  Fact : As long as you don't regularly wear a hat that's so tight that it restricts circulation--blood flow to the hair follicles--this will not cause hair loss.

uRXZDs8kaa	You didn't say what was originally prescribed. Do you mean you got brand Fioricet the first month and then generic for the refill? If that is the case then I have news for you: Fioricet has caffeine in it. It contains butalbital, acetaminophen, and caffeine. That's why you see the ingredients listed on the generic label instead of the brand name "Fioricet" but caffeine is still in the Fioricet pills.<br>  <br>  If you were on a totally different drug the first month then that is a different issue. Or maybe you were given the wrong medication the first month? (the correct med is recorded in the computer but the wrong pills were put in the bottle??? I'm just trying to figure out what is going on based on how you described it since you said it was a refill not a new script)  Or maybe the store switched generic manufacturers so the pills look different?<br>  <br>  In any case, if the pills are generic for Fioricet they are going to have caffeine in them. So maybe you were supposed to refill a different prescription?|`|b73bda331fdfa778ce67f7c1e95159e5aa	Take it back with a note from your doctor specifically stating that you cannot have pills with caffeine; the pharmacist is legally required to follow the written prescription.  If the original *written* prescription did not specify, they're allowed to substitute any equivalent product; this allows the use of generics, which many people prefer due to the lower cost.<br>  <br>  Whether you can force them to take back or refund the incorrect pills is less clear, and might need an attorney.  If they value customer service, though, they should do so without too much pressure.|`|zYhkCNZZaa	Only blue pill i know is Viagra ! LOL  !<br>  <br>  I agree some of us are very caffeine sensitive so take it back !
AA12381717	I go to the gym almost every day.  I don't always use the elliptical, but when I do, I do intervals.  I go faster with less resistance for a few minutes, and then slower with more resistance for a few minutes.  The machines at my gym have buttons for interval training and you can just choose what level you want to be on.  Good for you for wanting to be fit and healthy.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a best machine for cardio.  I think you need to do a combination of different types of cardio, so that your body doesn't get used to just one type.  I definitely think an elliptical makes you burn calories faster than a bike or walking.  I'm not sure about running, because I don't run.  I think you should do primarily the elliptical when you are at the gym, since you said that you walk the rest of the week.  If you could do a little bit of biking or use the step machine, you'll notice a difference in what muscles are working too.|`|nQWpYvRwaa	Hi, I clicked on this question because I answered a question and saw your answer with a link... smart!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would strongly recommend a combination of the two, more resistance does burn calories but geared more toward bulding mucles. Less resistance goes faster with emphasis on fat burning with more calories released. <br>  <br>  I always wondered about that too when I was your age!|`|HHB9LUqiaa	I would say it depends on what your want.. if you want to tone more go slower with more resistance.. if you want more cardio go faster with less resistance.. if you want both switch.. one day do slower with more resistance and the next day go faster for more cardio
X1uOh8ylaa	Some girls' periods arrive like clockwork. Others get theirs at slightly different times each month. Many girls get regular periods most of the time, but occasionally skip a period or get an extra period during times of pressure or stress. In fact, you may notice that when you go on a trip or have a major change in your schedule your period is late. All of this is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  It's also normal for the number of days a girl has her period to vary. Sometimes a girl may bleed for 2 days, sometimes it may last a week. That's because the level of hormones the body manufactures can be different from one cycle to the next, and this affects the amount and length of bleeding.<br>  <br>  So how can you tell when you're about to get your period? If your cycle is not regular, you'll want to pay attention to the clues your body may give you. These include:<br>  <br>  back cramps or stiffness <br>  heavier breasts or breast soreness <br>  headaches <br>  acne breakouts <br>  disturbed sleep patterns <br>  mood swings <br>  bloating <br>  Most of the time, irregular periods are part of the normal changes that can happen when you're a teen. At some point as you grow, your cycle will probably settle into a recognizable pattern. This usually happens by 3 years after your first period.<br>  <br>  However, some teens may develop irregular periods — or stop having periods altogether — as a result of certain medications, excessive exercise, very low body weight, or not eating enough calories. Others may develop problems as a result of a hormone imbalance. For example, disorders of the thyroid gland can cause menstrual irregularities if the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood become too low or too high.<br>  <br>  Some women have irregular periods because their bodies produce too much androgen, which is a hormone that causes increased muscle mass, facial hair, and deepening of the voice in males and the development of pubic hair and increased height in girls. High amounts of androgen can also cause hair growth on the face, chin, chest, and abdomen, and is sometimes associated with excessive weight gain.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these problems, or if your periods are irregular for 3 years or more, see a doctor. The doctor may prescribe hormone pills or other medications or recommend lifestyle changes that can help you to have regular periods|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Irregular periods might be an indication of a problem. Most women have cycles every 23-35 days. And whatever is considered normal for that particular women, won't usually change more than a couple days. For example my cycle is typically 30 days. Once in awhile I have a 29 or 31 day cycle.<br>  <br>  Here are some possible causes for irregular periods:<br>  Significant weight gain or loss<br>  Over-exercise<br>  Poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates)<br>  Smoking<br>  Drug use<br>  Caffeine<br>  Excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone)<br>  Eating disorders<br>  Increased stress<br>  Polycystic ovarian syndrome/estrogen dominance<br>  Uterine abnormalities (fibroids/cysts/polyps/endometriosis)<br>  Hormonal imbalance related to perimenopause (early menopause)<br>  Medications<br>  Chemotherapy<br>  Recent childbirth, miscarriage, or D&C<br>  Breastfeeding<br>  <br>  It sounds like each bleeding episode isn't a full cycle, but instead you are having breakthrough bleeding during your cycles. Your first cycle was probably 23 days. Your next cycle probably 25 (15 + 10). The next cycle 24 (18 + 6). Are you on birth control pills? They can often cause breakthrough bleeding.<br>  <br>  Keep track of your bleeding, and talk to your doctor. S/he will be able to give you the best answer.|`|wobRTCvHaa	don't worry, you're fine nothing is wrong.<br>  im the same age. trust me, its normal. <br>  after a while it will start to get more regular.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Don't worry there's nothing wrong with you, it's completely normal.  A lot of women have irregular periods their whole lives.  The downside to it is that you never know when it's coming so you always have to keep a pad or tampon handy just in case.  If it really bothers you, then you can always get on birth control which does wonders at regulating your period

uqRb9tAqaa	Brown bread is generally good for you, but you shouldn't eat 9 slices. Bread has a lot of carbs - and carbs are what get burned off before calories and fat. So, if you eat too many carbs you will most likely gain weight, or have troubles maintaining your weight. And in generally, carbs aren't too good for you if you have a lot. I would suggest toning it down to like 4 slices a day.    Good luck  xoxo|`|BqVolg5Faa	You'll get fat and nobody will want to love you.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	umm yes I would say so|`|IT9DJQNiaa	Maybe try to lessen up your bread into 5 because 9 I think is too much.

Make sure you are buying natural bread to get the best benefits possible. I think 9 is too many. For me, I would only eat 4 slices a day. You need other nutrients too!|`|al0cCPb6aa	I personally would say yes, that is a lot of servings of carbs...are you eating other carbs on top of that? I would say 6 slices tops...but for me that's even pushing it. Depends on what other carbs are in your diet.
9Zbh8HZxaa	this is very common actually, this is a form of rebellious activity, not listening to your parents will only come back to haunt you when you really want something from them like a car , new snowboard, a trip to Cancun Mexico , a concert  .... keep doing well in school even though you don't like it, education is very important. try to compromise with your parents don't leave them with difficult decisions, you won't like the outcome. do what's right . being a rebel is overrated. be yourself, you will have plenty of time to rebel when your 18-21 good times ! good luck young buc

Right now, you have no idea what your parents can do and if you did, you wouldn't do what you have done.  Your parents can do to you so much more than you do to them.  It's like you have no respect for your life.  There's nothing you can do about what you've done.  Swallow your pride and go talk to them and apologize for your past actions.

Having teeth pull can be one of the most traumatic experience a person can go through, so prevention is the best way to combat negative dental experiences.  You try switching toothpaste to see if there is on you like, you can also try brushing with out tooth paste for a whilebut you need to force yourself to brush twice a day, and get over you phobia (or what ever is causing you  to cough)  If you have cavities brushing now wont make them go away and if they are deep eneough they will keep growing, so you can brush all you want and it will not stop any present cavities.  You need to see a dentist.  Call you dental association in you state and find out where there are clinics that do reduce fee work or even pro bono.  <br>  <br>  But get into the habit of brushing.  I brush twice a day and have not had a cavity in 20 years.  Brushing beats getting a filling or a tooth pulled as a result of not brushing.|`|p5wTtH3taa	Nope.

WwWpjYXUaa	If you are still within the growing age then perhaps you can add a few inches by eating a balanced diet and leading an active life. A nutritious diet that includes fruits and vegetables, dairy, cereals, meat, and plenty of water will aid the natural process for enhancing height. A good and proper night’s sleep is also essential for the growth process. Taking part in active sports along with some stretching exercises can have a cumulative effect on human growth. There is not much we can do to grow taller after puberty. There are many products in the market today that claim to increase height of adults, but they are all scams without sufficient scientific evidence. Surgical options, though available, are EXTREMELY RISKY and of course expensive.  This leaves us with basically two options.<br>  <br>  1. Stretching Exercises: - These exercises will help you improve your posture. You’ll be surprised that how much of “Height” is hidden behind your slouched back. You can, at any age, add an inch or two of height by simply improving your posture. Follow the link below for information on specific height enhancing exercises:<br>  <a href="http://walktallshoes.com/grow-taller-exercises.html" rel="nofollow">http://walktallshoes.com/grow-taller-exe...</a><br>  <br>  2. Second, you can create a “Taller” effect by following some smart fashion techniques.  You can easily add another inch or two of “illusionary height” by improving your dress coordination.  The link below can provide some input on height increase through fashion effect:<br>  <a href="http://www.walktallshoes.com/how-to-dress-taller-quiz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.walktallshoes.com/how-to-dres...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rf0WEI8Maa	You will proubly grow a little bit taller..

atGN7MoYaa	on a diet shouldn't eat foods with:  cholesterol  a lot of fat  a lot of sugar      on a diet you should eat:  grains  fruits  veggies      =)    p.s.- eating celery burns more calories than you take in|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you should eat EVERYTHING in moderation.  never eliminate a food group -our body's need cholesterol, sugars, carbs, fats, proteins, etc.  speak to a nutritionist if you need a more specific answer.  be mindful of portion sizes.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com|`|ONRpcM82aa	For a healthy diet, you should avoid sweets and fried foods.  There is alot of "healthy" foods out there that are really the worst that you can eat so be careful.  Include more fruits, vegetables, and nuts in your diet.

You're 15, menstruating and growing so you need more food. You are eating so much that your body can't handle it, meaning it has to go into overtime digesting and disposing of all the extra food. Hence why you feel nauseous and you have diarrhea. Eat a little more food each day than the day before. Don't eat one meal one day than a full three meals the next. If you don't start feeling better within a week, go to the doctor.|`|q106uCAZaa	You might have an infection, you might have irritable bowel syndrome, it could be a lot of things.<br>  I know you don't want to hear that you should see a doctor, but come on.

You could possibly be having Diareha from eating so much - and predominitately WHAT are you eating? Nerves can even trigger Diareha, as can a lot of things. You can tell yourself not to eat so much and tell your brain that you're just not hungry. Another one is - you could be having after affect symptoms of your period, It happens to me too where I just want to eat everything In site after my period. If this persists for a week - please go to the doctors. It could possibly be all in your head causing these affects but for your own peace of mind go to a doctors.

Firstly, saying you don't want to see the doctor is not wise. I too say that and now and I'm 33! I also have a crazy fear of doctors, remember they are there to help you.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the diarrhea is an affect of your panic (and it is!) you may say but it's not going away, that's because your bodies stress lasts longer then your panic.<br>  <br>  Why you are getting pain I don't know but that's what DOCTORS are for, it's probably growing pain or a hormone thing, you are growing up and your body is going through a lot of changes.<br>  <br>  Calm down, try and learn how to relax and go to the doctors to be checked. The feeling of relief when you leave the doctors office will be awesome! Also you will notice that your diarrhea will stop!<br>  <br>  Please try and calm down and ignore stupid answers like "you're going to die"<br>  <br>  Good luck.

EcS6ImfKaa	yes - most likely it is an allergic reaction. An itch usually means there is a chemical in the skin. With poison ivy the chemical is an oil that causes the skin to itch. It is good you have been writing down what you have been eating and drinking - it is a first step. If you want a suggestion I can tell you a faster way - go on a restricted diet where you eat only a few items. Because if you eat many items it will be too confusing to figure out which item is the guilty item and then there may be more than one item that is guilty. My most restricted diet is bread and water. With only two items the allergies should go away. If not then either the bread or water is giving me allergies. But if the allergies is gone then I can add a 3rd food item and then 3rd food item is tested (see if it gives me a reaction).... and so on.|`|53YYMICkaa	there are many symptoms for an allergic reaction.. the main ones are: <br>  swelling (generally in the eyes or infected area)<br>  small red dots on your arms and legs (if it is a skin reaction)<br>  feeling sick around the thing you're allergic to<br>  <br>  on your arms might mean a cream or you eating/drinking something<br>  It sounds like you're intolerant to something so i would go to a doctor and see what they think <br>  Hope it gets better ^_^
BDXTmvrqaa	Both above answers are good. If you have stairs, run up and down them. Also, at the bottom step (if you have stairs) or any curb like along a street, stand at the edge with your toes on the step or curb and lift yourself up and down with controlled movments.

I don't know what your body "build" or "type" is, but unless you're one of those super-slim people, I'd say there is NO need to lose weight. Maybe you could just exercise.

That will also help you feel better about yourself (endorfins...er...spelling) :)|`|wGdmKEQ6aa	I would say 10 pounds at that height and weight would be like a lot....and would look very skinny, it wouldn't lead to anorexia, 5 pounds would be ok.

PGTM31Vdaa	A cold sore is gonna be pretty obvious, and there's not really mistaking whether it's one or not. You can only get a cold sore if you've been directly exposed to one, mainly through kissing. Could you have gotten one by kissing a family member? <br>  I'm not sure if you can get a cold sore through sharing drinks, but that could be a possibility. I guess all you can do is let it go away.

LR5m5WDOaa	I do think the doctor is a good idea.  I have a chronically runny nose.  The constant moisture dries out your nose - just like your lips get more chapped in the winter if you lick them a lot -  Once it get dried out, you get sores in there...more moisture and a little irritation you end up with bloody noses.  Right after you blow you nose and it's dry put some Vaseline in there - esp before you go to bed when you aren't going to be wiping it out so soon.  That may help with the nose bleeds. I hear good things about nasal washes - but it didn't help any for me.   If you are also bleeding easily when you brush your teeth, or bruising easily, I would worry that your blood is too thin.  You definitely want to see a doc for that.<br>  <br>  I don't think Supersonic has any clue what he's talking about with laying your head back and migraines.  If you lay your head back when your nose is bleeding the blood goes into your throat or stomach and can upset your stomach.  It doesn't run into your brain!<br>  <br>  As far as migraines - look for a trigger.  Is there something that always happens right before you get a migraine.  Not enough sleep, smells, anger...<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|ce2427d2bb5aacba0d9fa20c1e73e943aa	you should go to the doctors and see what they reccomend|`|32d8fbc9a837c07af7128533f6887c6faa	Go to the doctors. I have no idea what is causing the bleeding nose but you might be getting a migraine from the blood.

What I am sure though is you should go to the docotrs.|`|0dTN4Grvaa	hi ,not much info but bleeding from ur nose 4 times in a week and migraines might indicate hypertension.have ur blood pressure checked asap

DE3Scu5Jaa	the best thing to do is calorie count. then you can eat what you want within the limit of your calories. I eat chocolate all the time while I have been losing weight (70pounds) I have found its the easiest way to go because you don't feel like you are missing out on anything. I'm from Australia so I have been using an Australian website calorieking.com.au which I know there is also an American one, but I know for sure the Australian one is free to join and it works out all the calories for you. because it can get tiring, but eventually you tend to start learning about the foods you are eating so you don't need to write everything down because its in your head.<br>  I found that the most important thing for me in the beginning was getting my eating under control & I lost 30pounds before I even brought exercise into the equation. So if you can do exercise from the beginning thats great & every little bit helps.  Also I have a baby and a husband too & it's not to hard to factor calorie counting into your everyday lifestyle. Like cooking for you kids and partner. good luck!<br>  <br>  More stuff :-)<br>  some ways to cut some calories back is to:<br>  try to drink only water. if you like tea and coffee try and drink them black. Lots of people consume a lot of extra calories through drinking soft drinks and even juices. Also when you are about to eat dinner drink a big glass of water because you will find that you will become fuller faster and that will help your portions sizes.<br>  snacking is a big part of hidden calories. if you tend to snack it might be better if you prepare them earlier, like putting them in little plastic bags with the calories already counted so you can eat them throughout the day, but they are already counted for :-)<br>  Another way is how you might prepare you food. if you usually cook your vegetables in oil, trying steaming or boiling. <br>  When you cook meat, try grilling and if you need to use an oil use a spray as it ends up being less than if you were to pour some of the oil on. Also you could cook meat in a non stick pan with oil spray too.<br>  <br>  I think another best way for cutting down on some calories is when you are serving your meals, think about what you are putting down on your plate, maybe try and put one handful less than you usually would. you just need to start small & it does get easier over time. Once your stomach isn't eating as much as it usually is you'll find you will start getting that fuller feeling and you wont feel the need to eat large portions. <br>  if you can stick with it for 2 weeks, generally it becomes easier then, especially if you have the results of weight loss for extra motivation.|`|AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less.<br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  <br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fruits too and boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) Try to chew ur every food for atleast 20 times. And then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  7) No Potato Please. It is strictly forbidden during this diet<br>  8) No Junk Food Please. <br>  9) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. Rather take a bottle of water with you all the time, when you feel starving, drink it as much as u can.<br>  10) Make you habit to use brown bread.<br>  11) use skimmed and low fat milk and yogurt<br>  12) Sugar is strictly forbidden in this diet plan. <br>  13) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u really wants to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (but not cola), but just one glass once in a week.<br>  14) Eat at least once in a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup ( as ur dinner or lunch), as much as u can but no corn flour in it. <br>  15) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  16) if u feel hungry then divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  17) one bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  18) No hard drink of any type is allowed in this diet.<br>  19) Smoking strictly forbidden in this diet<br>  20) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  21) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  22) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  23) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we all are impatient. You have to be patient in terms of your weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  24) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months and when u feel that u have achieved your desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for you entire life.  Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that you will never have to loose weight again. But occasionally u can take other junk food too.<br>  25)  You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  26) Never ever go for any type of Diet pills or any drug which claim that it will reduce the weight quickly. Taking Diet pills will kill. <br>  27) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan. Start your exercising slowly and gradually increase the intensity. Trying too hard at first can lead to injury. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run on tread mill for at least 30 mnts daily. Try to extend ur period for one hour. And if you don’t have this facility then best indoor Exercise is skipping.<br>  |`|aJFISQFFaa	www.calorie-count.com.. i find this one helps they have alot of groups. you can keep track of your diet and activities. Just think. you only live once.. so live longer!! you'll feel so good when you start to lose weight n get your kids envovled even if it's taking them out to the park for a run!! healthy foods are expensive so try cyt back on what you eat. cereal is a good snack, fruit and even salad.

Investigate your local gym - mine has free childcare, so most mums tend to have their kids at the childcare facility for an hour while they exercise.<br>  <br>  The key to a successful diet is to not restrict too much - portion control works a lot better and will keep you from binging.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Doctors typically do NOT cure disease in anyone, and that includes their own families.  Doctors treat symptoms, not root causes of disease.  That is their training and they have been educated away from making people healthy.  That is one of the reasons why the health food industry has grown very large and "alternative" medicine is growing very large now.<br>  <br>  Drug companies pay huge money to politicians and the government passes laws in favor of this approach to medicine.  It is called the Allopathic approach to medicine.  Pasteur started this philosophy and basically it says, kill the germ and you kill the disease.  Medicine is dedicated toward this goal and this is why drugs and surgery are the only tools doctors use in "modern medicine" today.  They are not trained or schooled in nutrition and how to make the body healthy.  The "Beachump" philosophy of medicine is more in tune with what health food people follow and that is that if you make the host healthy, disease won't be able to get a food hold.  <br>  <br>  Both philosophies have their place, but neither seem to want to join forces, so what we have today is a drug culture treating symptoms and a huge number of sick people walking around.  In 1905, the CDC reported that less than 5% of ALL Americans were chronically ill.  In 2005, the same CDC reported that over 53% of ALL Americans are now chronically ill.  Does that sound like progress to you?  Americans now rank 45th in the world for longevity.  44 countries have people living longer than Americans.  Yet, we are told we are living longer than ever before.  We are being kept alive, with a poor quality of life and health, with drugs, and it is make believe health.  <br>  <br>  The answer is that doctors do not understand how to make people healthy, just treat symptoms.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|LibFxkeBaa	I don't think it's ironic, I think it's sad.  Can you imagine the frustration?|`|y3ZAHnBYaa	Because doctors have a code of ethics that they all adhere to for the obvious reasons.

Revel in the fact you don't have to put up with bloody knickers and suspicious leaks yet. But really, it will start when you body is ready and no sooner.|`|uqRb9tAqaa	You're really thin, so that might be one of the reasons. If that's naturally how you're body is, that's fine, but make sure you're eating enough please. :) Once you hit 100 pounds you'll be more likely to get it. But if you've had discharge for a year at least, than you're likely to get it soon. I'd say, as long as you're eating healthy and all you'll get it this year, probably in the next few months. I know people who have gotten it at 15 though, so no worries.    xoxo  Simona|`|MMGKVtVVaa	You should probably get it soon.  Be on the look out for a clear discharge in your undies.  That lets you know it is coming soon.  Some people also get cramps before their period.  And just to let you know, be GLAD that you havent gotten your period yet.  So what if everyone else already has it?  Your period is a big deal and responsibility, not something that you go "I want it"   It is NOT FUN AT ALL to have your period.  If you are younger, you have to worry about maintaining it in school.  It is also very annoying and stains your clothes.  Not to mention, A LOT of pain. (cramps)|`|ygLjblp2aa	On average, most girls do not get their period until they are at least 100 lbs.

You're BMI is 15.1, which is wayyyy underweight. Your body will not be able to handle having your period, you are too weak.

Don't get so hyped up about it though. I know you don't wanna hear this, but it's way to complicated and annoying. You have to think about when you'll change your tampon/pad (especially at school), be sure you don't leak, get over the cramps, watch your attitude, etc., etc. On top of that peeing is just a great big hassle! You wipe, more blood comes, you wipe again, blood comes again. PERIODS ARE ANNOYING!     I know you want it real bad but once you get it you'll trade it for anything! You might get it before June but don't count on it. It will come when it comes. Good Luck!

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|KWL7Y3Rzaa	Join a gym!<br>  Or go buy a treadmill.|`|BHDXE76oaa	strech and dont eat much|`|y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet<br>  <br>  As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.<br>  <br>  I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.<br>  <br>  First, let's dispel some common myths.<br>  <br>  Myth 1:<br>  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.<br>  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.<br>  <br>  Myth 2:<br>  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.<br>  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.<br>  <br>  Myth 3:<br>  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.<br>  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.<br>  <br>  Myth 4:<br>  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.<br>  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.<br>  <br>  Myth 5:<br>  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.<br>  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.<br>  <br>  ~~The Anshar Diet~~<br>  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.<br>  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).<br>  <br>  2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.<br>  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")<br>  <br>  3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.<br>  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.<br>  <br>  4. Eat breakfast. Always.<br>  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.<br>  <br>  5. Drink water.<br>  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go|`|H8VlvH5gaa	I had way too much fat in all the wrong places until I tried acai berry, I understand they say that pills will not work, however they certainly worked for me, and they have been showcased on CNN too.

2rHCCZiBaa	Un aneurisma popliteo va trattato chirurgicamente o endovascolarmente per evitare che la sua occlusione acuta possa provocare una ischemia acuta dell'arto con pericolo di amputazione.<br>  L'intervento può essere effettuato o in maniera tradizionale sostituendo il tratto di arteria dilatato con una protesi sintetica, o se persistono le condizioni l'esclusione della parte dilatata con una protesi sintetica posizionata in maniera endovascolare.<br>  <a href="http://www.dica33.it/esperto/visualizza.asp?id=29605" rel="nofollow">http://www.dica33.it/esperto/visualizza....</a><br>  <br>  L’arteria poplitea è la seconda sede più comune di aneurismi. I movimenti del ginocchio traumatizzano l’arteria. In aggiunta, la compressione dell’arteria, quando lascia il canale di Hunter nella parte bassa della coscia, comporta dilatazione poststenotica, che è poi esacerbata dallo sviluppo di aterosclerosi. Molte lesioni sono asintomatiche. I pazienti con un aneurisma pervio hanno masse pulsatili nella fossa poplitea, ma un aneurisma occluso può essere scambiato per una cisti. L’ecografia è diagnostica. Dovrebbero essere ricercati altri aneurismi; infatti il 50% dei pazienti con un aneurisma popliteo ha un aneurisma popliteo controlaterale e il 35% ha un aneurisma dell’aorta addominale. <br>  <br>  La tromboembolia, acuta o come una serie di piccoli emboli al piede, è la complicanza più comune (16% dei pazienti); essa richiede spesso di eseguire l’amputazione. Occasionalmente, il polso popliteo scompare e riappare a seconda di come il trombo cambia posizione nel sacco aneurismatico. Le altre complicanze comprendono rottura (in circa il 10%), compressione della vena poplitea e trombosi e compressione del nervo tibiale posteriore con irradiazione del dolore o perdita della sensibilià nel polpaccio.<br>  <br>  Trattamento <br>  I pazienti con aneurismi occlusi non richiedono un trattamento specifico; il trattamento è lo stesso come quello dell’occlusione arteriosa periferica (Vedi: "Trattamento" .). Gli aneurismi pervi, tuttavia, sono pericolosi per l’alto rischio di rottura e tromboembolia. L’intervento chirurgico risulta necessario, a meno che il paziente sia molto debilitato o abbia una prognosi infausta a breve termine per un’altra causa. Può essere usata, se necessaria, l’anestesia spinale o anche locale. L’aneurisma non è resecato, ma è bypassato e separato dalla circolazione mediante una legatura prossimale.<br>  OCCLUSO=TROMBIZZATO!!!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.msd-italia.it/altre/geriatria/sez_11/sez11_95c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.msd-italia.it/altre/geriatria...</a>

HpqGnCFAaa	its lactic acid built up in your muscles that results in inflammations and pain. Stretch before any running. Drink lots of fluids like Gatorade. and also wear a better supported shoe such a New Balance or Nike. hope this helps|`|F4fAEP4kaa	Well I used to love running until I found out that it is horrible on your joints. Now I do other things to stay in shape. I love swimming & hiking. They are much easier on your joints.|`|2277af9334d38e9e40b267c6c7f5f318aa	Sorry, but that sounds like the onset of arthritis. You can try Glucosamine but different running shoes will not help.
Muz6YB18aa	Reducing stomach acid can help canker sores. When I was younger, my mom would give me pepto bismal for canker sores. I also like Tagamet (cimetidine) for acid reduction. Aloe vera juice is good for the tummy and you can swish it around in your mouth too. I like Lilly of the Desert brand Stomach formula aloe vera juice- mix with water half and half (or dilute more if you prefer.) I get aloe juice at my local health food store. Canker sores can be like stomach ulcers in your mouth.
I8xjT8kNaa	It doesn't sound like you have bipolar disorder specifically. Many people have changes in motivation like that for no apprarent reason and it could well be some kind of other disorder that causes the change, if not bipolar. As a side note, it might be a good idea to get rid of that medical book--it doesn't sound like it will really help you overcome any phobias, as it only feeds your ability to find diseases that (as you know) you probably don't have.|`|d2a0990475e0f667c5ad93ab48d28197aa	No, it does not sound like Bipolar.   Bipolar disorder is characterized by INTENSE changes in moods.  The mood episodes usually last for weeks or months and they affect the person's life.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing for you to do is to get rid of that medical book and stop reading about disease and illness.  You are trying to pigeonhole yourself into a disease.  Your actions sound like depression and I would suggest seeing a doctor to get back on some meds.|`|OutLojh7aa	I not sure labeling yourself as bipolar maybe a little premature,<br>  if you feel you have issues with any disorders, I would recommend you to go to a psychologist. Good Luck
hVVoyDEvaa	It's not for sure yet because in 2006, researchers examined antiperspirant use and other factors among 54 women with breast cancer and 50 women without breast cancer. The study found no association between antiperspirant use and the risk of breast cancer; however, family history and the use of oral contraceptives were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Because studies of antiperspirants and deodorants and breast cancer have provided conflicting results, additional research is needed to investigate this relationship and other factors that may be involved.   And I think until now there aren't a antiperspirant deoderant without aluminum. A product can be labeled "natural" and still have highly processed versions of the natural ingredient meaning that they are really poor imitations and potentially harmful chemicals.  Even the "organic" label can be abused since only one ingredient can qualify for the label!|`|eFDOhVGLaa	At any health food store you can buy a crystal like rock mineral that has no chemicals.  The way it works, is the minerals prevent bacteria from growing so therefore--no smells.  You will still sweat, but no stink.  I use Kiss My Face brand that comes in different fragrances and in a roll-on form.  It takes about 3 weeks before it starts working though as you pores need to unclog from prior deodorant's.|`|fACWmhuFaa	Hi, Yes this is an aluminum free deodorant which is called TOM'S you can find it at your drugstore, it contains the botanicals lichen and coriander for fighting odor, and aloe vera to soothe the skin. Hope this helps|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Yes, and many. Look at healthy stores, where they sell organic items.
FO34AN7haa	Well first off I would advise medical detox if needed...alcohol withdrawl can be very dangerous.    Detoxing instructions without medical supervision that are helpful    Have someone administer 1 oz of vodka or whiskey, purely on an as needed basis to "taper off", no more than 1 oz every hour at first then increase time in between. 1 every 2 hrs...1 every 3 hrs...etc..     Multi-Vitamin    Orange-juice/honey/tons of sugar mixed in a glass    I know its gross but, drain juice out of saurkraut and mix it with the orange juice and honey, it contains many vitamins...    Supervise the detoxing person and call the ambulance if needed..    Again, i would advise medical detox, but if not these are some suggestions.

txVu1SH4aa	I don't think there are any government regulations for quality between grocery stores and supplement stores, I believe it's the same all over the country. I think the store employee was saying that the supplement stores have a higher standard for quality since people are probably expecting to get better quality products. Grocery stores are probably expecting people to buy with impulse and not really care about quality.
vQZvqJBcaa	I wanted Paragard but my Doctor said to go with Mirena because I already had heavy periods and heavy cramping and, Mirena has hormones but it would help with that problem. And it doesn't cause weight gain! ^_^ Also, she said if I did get Paragard that it would worsen my periods and cramps! Paraguard does inflict harder cramping and heavier bleeding. I love the IUD though. I am only 19, with no kids, but it's the best birth control. If you don't want hormones and are willing to risk heavy cramping and possibly more bleeding, then go for it girl. I will say, the insertion of the IUD is very painful! This is because they have to dilate your cervix and make sure your uterus is big enough for the IUD or else they stretch it just a little. You will feel HORRIBLE cramping and most women (including me) get dizzy and hot flashes right after it is inserted. I never get that way!<br>  <br>  However, if you want to minimize the pain of insertion take some Ibuprofen 30 mins before, or ask them to put an anesthetic jelly in you. The pinching part of it wasn't that bad to me as the Cramps were, which is caused by dilation of the cervix. She told me that it is similar to the feeling of going into labor, when your cervix begins to dilate to 10cm. BUT, they only dilate it a little not to 10!, but it hurts! Hope this has helped you. Oh, and yes, that entire day will be painful. The cramps will be bad. It'll last a couple of days but the worst day is the first day. Make sure you eat something before you go too.<br>  <br>  If you have a man (Which I'm sure you do, because they recommend not using IUDs unless you are in a monogamous relationship because of the higher risk of infections and stds to the uterus because of the IUD) then have him take you and rub your lower belly when you cramp, and that'll make you feel better. :) Good luck on your choice!<br>  <br>  *** EDIT ***<br>  Nancy is right below me. It works by sending mini abortions.|`|CATz28tvaa	Well I have never had one so I cant tell you about the pain, but I can tell you about the nasty infections and the problems that come along with most IUDs.|`|640yZiqKaa	It pinches quite a bit on insertion, but after that, not so much.|`|LSBqGQFSaa	I had one several years ago, and I found it extremely painful to have inserted.  (Removal was painless)<br>  Here is more info that I wasn't given when I had mine.<br>  If you are pro life you might want to check out the link below.  I was surprised to learn that it is not a contraceptive but an "abortifacient" It causes a "mini abortion" at approximately 1-2 wks of pregnancy.|`|RIaHG9glaa	i had a copper IUD for about 3 or 4 months. i had to have it taken out because of the pain. but my doctor said it probably hurt me because i have a tilted uterus...whatever that means.|`|guSLpHlPaa	i m a medical student and i like to tell u that if u want to do this u can but firstly confirm about it . sometimes it is helpful in the long run but sometime if not inserted properly it can do irritation inside so be careful<br>  i m telling this to u as a daughter
7EEfRkzCaa	I could be<br>  But also if you rub too hard or put too much then that can be the cause too.<br>  Both can be the problem because I've rubbed too hard and gotten a sore spot

You may need to go on the pill to sort out the heavy periods. try drinking cranberry juice till u get to the Dr. forget about the tampons till u get the other issues sorted out your body is under stress and can make it harder to use them. Good luck dont worry just get ure self checked by Dr.|`|2K5Ebc38aa	Now see, some of that, the weakness and the pain during urination, are normal if they're relatively subtle. The diarrhea is worrisome, and the UTIs are a bit abnormal. Be sure you're changing your tampons and not just the pads. Ever hear of Toxic Shock Syndrome? It could be that.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'm really not sure. Talk to your gyno as soon as possible unless it gets reeeeeeally bad, then go to the ER.

jZ03Zdjdaa	It is quite damaging to your health, physical and mental, to have such a high stress level and get so little sleep.  Here's what you need to do:  You need to discuss this with your parents and call a meeting with your teachers, school guidance counselor, the school principal, and hopefully your doctor.  <br>  <br>  At this point, you need your work load cut up to half, even if college has to wait another year.  You need to get to the source of the problem:  Is this a school that loads you up on honors classes and a heavy homework load to get you into a good college?  Do you have a learning disability, perhaps undiagnosed?  (Nothing to be ashamed of).  Are you having trouble in one or more subjects that take up a disproportionate amount of your time?  If so, tutoring can help.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, your health comes FIRST.  School comes second.  You in conjunction with the adults in your life must work out a solution.  Your parents should have been in tune enough with you to be helping you with your situation already.  But since they aren't, you need to be proactive about it.  It's better to have a smaller workload where you get enough sleep, less stress, and do well.  Otherwise, you're on the path to getting sick, and your illness will force you to take the break your body needs.<br>  <br>  BTW, when my husband worked at a high tech firm in the Silicon Valley, the stress load was high, and people typically got about 2 to 4 hours sleep a night.  There were people there who prematurely aged, dropped dead from heart attacks and other illnesses, and several who committed suicide.  People can not and should not live with the ridiculously high stress level and work load, and ridiculously low levels of sleep like you describe.<br>  <br>  P.S. to added info:  Your problem is #3 and #4.  Your well-meaning but somewhat clueless parents are part of the problem.  You need to start your HW as early as possible--4 pm if you can.  If they pick you up from school, they need to take you straight home so you can do your HW.  See if that helps.  I highly recommend you print up your question and all replies and show that to your parents.<br>  <br>  See if having about 3 - 3 1/2 extra hours a day helps your problem.  (I'm assuming 1/2 to 1 hour for dinner).  This is at least 15 extra hours in the school week for you to get your work done.<br>  <br>  If you still have a problem after that, you may need to learn how to be more organized (if that's an issue for you) and/or drop a class.  AP classes can be brutal.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, colleges look not just at GPA, but volunteer work/community service, hobbies, sports, and overall well-roundedness.  Right now, you're so bogged down with school, that even if you accomplish that 4.2 or 4.4 GPA, you won't be well-rounded enough for some admissions departments.  Better to have a 4.0 without so many AP classes, but to volunteer in the community, play an instrument, etc.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	Two AP classes at one time are enough.  <br>  <br>  I am surprised that your principal and guidance counselors approved such a tough schedule.<br>  <br>  I second Ms. X's suggestion . . . time to call a meeting with principal, guidance counselor and parents.|`|nVltBQBhaa	sounds like you might have bipolar or something similar. |`|6yGDisLFaa	you are burning out, so to keep the flame burning just a little longer.

Third, your friends are their n o matter what and sometimes just having them do their homework at the same time you do yours is just the support you need.  Your not incompetent just inexperienced,  This is a learning opportunity to not fill your plate so full, we all do it at one time or another.  Hang in there and don't be afraid to ask for help from your friends.  They give you that social break you need as you do homework, Friends understand and will help the best they can.|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	First, is it necessary that all but one of your classes is an AP class? Just because you are capable of doing the work doesn't mean you should push yourself so hard that it affects your health and emotional well-being. If you could change one or two of those classes to college prep classes, that would probably ease your stress quite a lot. Also, if there is an elective class on your schedule that you could drop and change to a study hall, that would give you that much more time to do your homework. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would buy a notebook specifically to record your homework assignments and due dates. Buy a second notebook to create a schedule for yourself. When you get home each day, take 15 minutes to sit down and write yourself a schedule for the night. Look at the homework that you have, and estimate how long it will take you to complete each assignment. If you have projects or papers, break them up into small sections and aim to tackle one section at a time. Schedule specific blocks of time for each assignment, and make sure to schedule breaks for yourself. Let your parents know what you're doing, and try to schedule an hour where you do nothing but relax. Many times when you feel overwhelmed and unable to relax, it's because of poor time management. Putting yourself on a schedule will allow you to see what needs to be done. It will also break everything up into smaller chunks so everything doesn't seem so overwhelming.<br>  <br>  |`|qbuz6oa8aa	First, you need sleep. <br>  An average person needs 7 hours of sleep, and your brain, you needs rest. You need to sleep to digest the Information.<br>  <br>  Also, never feel that you will get scolded by the teacher. That only makes you less confident and motivated.  Take one step at a time. Look at your textbook, find you what you don't understand about it, then you ask your teacher. If things are too difficult, you might wanna get some help from the better students.<br>  <br>  From what I read, I can feel your stress, and I suggest you take a good night's sleep, and the next morning, wake up, plan what you want to do. One by One. Start fresh every morning. Plan how long you need to do this, how long it take to do that, and just follow the plan. Also, put those important ones first. Try not to skip lunch, as your body needs energy to work.<br>  <br>  Every time you feel nervous and pressurised, just breathe in and out, tell yourself, there will be a way to do it. There will be a way to finish the stuff. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and all the best for your exams<br>  |`|058636f2837cb30d16abe14ee37469cbaa	My heart goes out to you.  It sounds like you are really stressed, which is causing you performance problems in school, which is making you more stressed.  You don't say why you are not sleeping, or what is taking up all your time, thus keeping you from homework, but it does sound like you might need some help from a counselor or psychologist.  Perhaps it is as simple as getting some medication or talking things through. Can you go to your parents and tell them you are overwhelmed? If so, ask them to take you to the family doctor.  If you explain your situation to the doctor, he or she can refer you to a mental health professional who can take it from there.  <br>  <br>  I know this feels overwhelming to you right now, but this is fixable.  You need to reach out for some help from a qualified professional of some kind and then take it from there.  There is always help available if you just ask.  Good luck to you.  I promise things will get better; this too shall pass.  Your concerns are real, but you can get through this.|`|1BHxvaQ8aa	You sound like your suffering from depression.<br>  There is lots of teens going through the exact same thing.<br>  There are medications that can help you with this, go to your family doctor and they will prescribe something for you.<br>  I also consider looking into counseling. This can help a lot when your going through depression.<br>  <br>  For your homework situation I suggest setting a time range in which you will work. Don't over work yourself, this will make you more stressed. And you need to get more sleep. Missing school will only worsen the situation. You will end up with more work. Talk to your teachers about all the home work and they might be able to give you more time, or get a doctor's note to give to them.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|4sHsbyDBaa	i was diagnosed an anxiety disorder last year, and i had alot of tijme off.

Have you been to see a doctor?<br>  If you go to a doctor and tell them about these experiences they may be able to help. They can send you to see counselors and psychologists who can help a lot. Also there are medications that can help take some of the anxiety away so you can at least sleep, do you school work and socialise again.<br>  <br>  If I am right about it being anxiety, you will experience great relief from following my advice.<br>  At least go and ask a doctor if they can help...you deserve at least that!<br>  
izEqYVtOaa	Yes it is normal.  I'm a virgin and I'm 19.  If you want to prolong it, try to hold back and slow down when your masturbating.  masturbating also helps you too in the long run if you do decide to have sex one day.|`|e0lfV7skaa	The fear is normal, but usually unfounded.  Once you do get laid, you'll find that it takes longer for most men to orgasm having sex than masturbating.  And even if your trigger is quick the first time, the second time it won't be.|`|9d9wYqwcaa	If you ejaculate quickly when you masturbate, then you can expect to ejaculate about 10 times as quick during sex and foreplay! <br>  <br>  Are you feeling a rush of nerves soon after you masturbate? Do you get alot of pre-come? This is a big sign of premature ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Being 23 and still a virgin, i bet you masturbate often. This is not good!! There is something called overmasturbation! You hear all these morons on this site tell guys that it is ok to masturbate as often as you want. But when you masturbate too often, you lose important hormones such as testosterone, DHEA, growth hormone. You also lose many important nervous system nuerotransmitters such as dopamine, seratonin, and acetyl-choline! <br>  <br>  Dopamine controls your endocrine system functions. Your endocrine system makes those hormones mentioned above. Without a healthy amount of testosterone and DHEA, you will have a weak erection, and have trouble maintaining an erection. When you ejaculate, you lose testosterone because it is needed to make more sperm. <br>  <br>  Seratonin controls your sympathetic nervous system. This is also call the "flight or fight" nervous system. When you deplete too much seratonin, your nerves in your penis and prostate will not be strong enough to hold back your orgasm and you will blow your load very quick! You also deplete acetyl-choline that controls your parasympathetic nervous system. This is the "rest and digest" nervous system. This keeps your erections strong. Its like the electric current to your erection. You need those nerves firing off to keep your testosterone burning and sending more nitric oxide to your penis. Nitric oxide is what expands the blood vessals.<br>  <br>  Some men think that sexual energy is endless. They think that more masturbation leads to better erections and longer sex sessions. The opposite is true! You need to stop ejaculating so much and let your body recover what it needs so you can have a strong sex drive and function.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more, email me. I went through this and cured myself of this problem!|`|rsTax7Vaaa	youth.

biFCKGAcaa	Liver Inflammation in other words termed as Hepatitis. It is characterised by the destruction of a number of liver cells and the presence of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue. <br>  <br>  Hepatitis can be caused by diseases that primarily attack the liver cells. It can also arise as a result of a disease such as mononucleosis. Hepatitis can be divided into two subgroups according to its duration: <br>  <br>  -Acute hepatitis has a number of possible causes.<br>  -Infectious viral hepatitis such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D and hepatitis E.<br>  -Other viral diseases such as: mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus.<br>  -Severe bacterial infections.<br>  -Amoebic infections.<br>  -Medicines, eg paracetamol poisoning and halothane (an anaesthetic).<br>  -Toxins: alcohol and fungal toxins, eg toadstool poisoning.<br>  <br>  How do you get hepatitis -<br>  <br>  A person can develop hepatitis if they contract one of the viruses that can cause liver inflammation, or as a result of exposure to substances that can cause hepatitis - alcohol, fungal toxins and certain medicines.<br>  <br>  There are two ways in which medicines can lead to hepatitis: it can either occur as a result of medicine poisoning through overdoses of a medicine (eg paracetamol), or it can occur as a result of an abnormal reaction of the liver to a normal dose (eg halothane, the anaesthetic). Fortunately, the latter type of hepatitis is rare.-<br>  |`|29ZL58Xjaa	You should ask your doctor if it comes to your body. You have a right to know what is going on with your liver.  There are many causes that could cause a liver to inflame. There are things like alcohol usage, drug usage, also if your body has a lot of toxins and it is having to work overtime, if you have a blood disorder, genetics to name a few.  But the best thing to do is to talk with your doctor.|`|yDdGoYLJaa	Hey there, don't worry too much about the results, just keep a closer eye on yourself. I frequently have an inflamed liver (out of 6 blood tests over a period of 3 years; 4 showed up as inflamed). I went for a liver scan and everything was fine.<br>  <br>  The main cause of inflammation tends to be alcohol, and closely followed by drugs. <br>  <br>  I don't drink any alcohol whatsoever, however, I do tend to take quite a lot of medication. I am guessing at that.<br>  <br>  <br>  So... If you drink, or take an excess of both prescription and/or recreational drugs then it will put a strain on your liver and could one day cause psoriasis, however, if you are a moderate user; then you haven't anything to worry about!<br>  <br>  Good Luck xx|`|6gkq7Fwkaa	Liver inflammation is actually the clinical definition of Hepatitis. Getting drunk though would have to be the most common cause. Alcohol stays in the liver until metabolized. Didn't your doctor say anything about what your test means? If not, ask him!
dJ92gis3aa	I've been on Lexapro for three months and I haven't gained weight but I'm on a strict diet and I workout a lot. I think you have to watchl your carb intake because I believe this drug slows down your ability to process sugars. I'm not a doctor but I did gain a lot of weight on paxil and I was craving a lot of carbs. Paxil is also an ssri. I love the way I feel on lexapro , I'm not depressed anymore and I'm actually enjoying life again.|`|cc1ba6b0728cacb0aa2b8c20c0cb48f6aa	I started on 10mg of Lexapro about 9 months ago and now I'm on 30mg.  I lost about 10 -15 lbs on it.  Not everyone gains weight on antidepressants.  Some people stay the same and others lose weight like me.  Just keep an eye on the scale and see what happens.  If you start to gain weight, then worry about it.
7b31cade28ca9a849b8c768af3e63b82aa	im wondering why you were AT the gyno and didnt ask these super important questions there.

93R5pEHpaa	If you get a chance to talk to her again, the worst thing you can do is say things like "C'mon, you have to come out of your house" "You can't keep starving yourself!" "What's wrong, don't be so sad." That will make her feel pressured and stressed and that's not what she wants to talk about. Just have a regular conversation, don't even bring up the depression/anorexia subjects. Ask her "How are you doing?" Tell her about your day, and talk about other things. She'll feel much more relaxed.<br>  And from my point of view, (I'm a girl), the one thing that can always make me smile is when a friend/boyfriend etc will go out of their way to make a kind gesture. Bringing her flowers is a GREAT idea. I promise it will make her smile. And also if you bring them to her house you will have a real good reason to see her and I'm sure her parents would be much more likely to let you in.<br>  If she is becoming anorexic, she is obviously feeling self concious of her looks. Give her a hug and say "Hey, beautiful." Even if she does look thinner, don't tell her that. It will make mer feel good that you noticed her weight loss and she will want to eat less and less because she will think it makes her look better and better. Tell her how nice her hair looks, or how you like the outfit she is wearing. Whatever you do do NOT comment on her weight. Whether that be "You've lost weight, you look good!" or "You're getting wayy too thin. Start eating." Girls in a fragile emotional state take things completely the wrong way wayyy too easily and you should just stay away from that subject because it's really hard to understand. Even if you think you're complimenting her, it could affect her negatively or drive her to eat less, feel the need to be thinner, etc.<br>  And obviously if it is clinical depression and if she is medically diagnosed with anorexia, she will need professional help, but until she feels comfortable with that and understands the fact that she does need help, don't bring up the subject. Slowly get to the point where she realizes there's something wrong and she needs to do something about it. Don't say out of the blue "You need help! go to the doctor!" It will piss her off and make her think you're trying to make her do something she doesn't want to do.<br>  <br>  So this was really long, sorry. But I really  hope it helps you out somehow.|`|WLAwpH83aa	I think she needs you more than ever now even though she's telling you to go away. You should go round to her house and bring her something like flowers or anything that will make her smile and let her know you are there for her. I think talking to her is the best thing to do and keep telling her how wonderful she is and what a great life she has. She probably needs a friend than a boyfriend and keep telling her you'll always be there for her. She'll soon see what a great guy you are. <br>  I hope i helped, you sound like a really nice guy and she is very lucky to have you. |`|444750251a2abcaf29357159f649a215aa	Let her know that you're there for her, whatever she needs. And tell her its not about that y'all had a relationship, its that you want to be her FRIEND and there for her no matter what she is going through.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I'm not sure what you can do...<br>  <br>  Good luck!
142397505edf01ae4fd5bba2b9f175b0aa	Anorexia can be all-consuming. If you've encouraged her to seek treatment, then, yes, you can become a threat in her mind. Anorexia destroys the body and the mind and so she isn't thinking rationally right now. <br>  <br>  If she still likes you, then maybe the best thing you can do is to just ignore her. If she tries to get back into touch with her, then say that you are not willing to be involved with her until she agrees to get treatment. If you stick by that, then perhaps she will. Maybe she won't. Either way, what matters more than your relationship is that she gets help and you're not going to be able to force her. The reason I say it's more important is because you can't have a good functioning relationship when she is in the mental mess of anorexia. She has made her disorder more important than you and that's not how a relationship should work.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds harsh, but really, anorexia consumes your life and sometimes the only wake-up call will come when you realize that you've lost so much that is important to you that it's no longer worth the disorder. Even then, though, the chances of her recovering on her own are somewhat slim, so she should get professional help.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry about your situation... It sounds so tough. Best of luck.|`|3d291501c7b6d3c3ffbfcf93aaf0bd93aa	She needs help before she can have a non-toxic relationship. Anorexia is a disease of the mind. She can't focus on you when she is focusing on her disease.

qUlLt3Yzaa	so long as you stretch after wards and do a warm up you will be alright doing that amount of push ups,however if you went to the gym and worked that  muscle group everyday you would get muscle fatigue  and then could risk further injury.  for a warm up do 10 push ups give yourself  a 2 minute break then do the 50.  That's what i do and i do 120 push ups every night (not in a row) An easy way to increase your reps is to just increase it by 1 or 2 each day its a small goal and easier to achieve then 5 or 10. pretty soon you will realize that  all of a sudden 1or 2 is not enough then you increase it a little more.  Then after awhile add some incline push ups into your routine  which is where you stick your feet on something about  2 feet above the ground and do a push up If you believe that you can do those one or two per day you will do them and realize its easy to achieve good luck.|`|JgF0DCrbaa	5000 a day.|`|LVuMTw9saa	Try pull ups too.

TiaGCg9Waa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities.  Impurities come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The impurities get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.

9206ed209c9df6b0ce28d5168357f66faa	Well immediately after workout, Whey is the way (haha) to go. Since whey protein is a fast digesting protein your body will be able to use it the fastest, which is important because your body needs something to repair with within about 30-45 minutes of your exercise. Bodybuilders, muscle-heads, and all kinds of athletes swear by whey right after workout, and so do I.<br>  <br>  I use this:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/wh...</a><br>  It's got high quality protein.<br>  <br>  If you are really looking to pound on muscle and are working out really hard then get a slow digesting protein supplement to take right before bed as well. Something like a casein protein supplement which takes much longer to digest. This will feed your body throughout most of the night while it repairs itself instead of starving your body. Be careful though, try to get a supplement without tons of carbs or fat, because consuming carbs and fat right before you go to bed will put on the bad kind of pounds (fat).

That is a lot to be dealing with for you and your mom.  My suggestion is if your parents are unwilling to go to family or couples counseling, that at the very least YOU get some counseling.

These compounds are rampant in our food supply and hard to avoid unless you know what to look for... this goes WAY beyond trans fats... there are some more sinister villians in our food too (more about that later).|`|1PooYDoHaa	crunches...I used to do 100 a day, every day!|`|hwXQzXQRaa	it seems like you gain weight most easily around your mid section. so it helps if you have more muscle in your midsection, it will make it appear smaller and flatter. do about 60-80 sit-ups a day, (hula-hooping is good too). and walk for 30-40 minutes, or jog. <br>  <br>  it always comes down to eating less calories than you need, if you want to lose weight. So if you need 1500 calories a day, take off 200-300 calories (since you're thin, and give it sometime and you'll lose your belly).<br>  <br>  Eating foods with fibrous foods help make your belly smaller too (helps digestion), basically more fruits and vegetables, and when eating carbs mostly whole grain.|`|r1hkyFmVaa	For belly fat, the best answer is Cardio, and lots of it.

But creatine just helps muscle growth, it opens up ur circulation so more water can get to your muscles, so when taking creatine u need to drink lots of water... and if ur trying to get big , u need to lift heavy weights for the creatine to take full effect and make u ripped, but if ur younger than me i wouldnt recommend lifting to much weight.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	There is no reason to take those kinds of supplements as a child. Your body is still growing and there is no reason why you need them.<br>  <br>  Stick with eating right, drinking lots of water and taking a high quality multivitamin. <br>  <br>  By taking those performance supplements now, it can really screw your body up later on in life when you stop taking them. Your body gets used to having them and not having to make them. So when you stop taking them your body goes through withdrawals. <br>  <br>  Think of your health for when you get older.|`|ODOFlQx2aa	Since I started to work out I was looking for a good weight loss product.

I am pretty strong for my age benching around 170.  In all my looking around and searching the web the only things I found were<br>  1) Your body is still growing you don't need it.<br>  2)  It will hurt your kindeys.<br>  3)  Teens will be more prone to use higher powered supplements such as anabolic steroids.<br>  4)  There is not enough research done on it to know of any severe side effects<br>  5) A bunch of other dependency, acne, etc.<br>  <br>   Through all my research I found nothing with enough evidence that it is bad for teenagers.  You're still growing... I understand that as being as you get at a heavier weight your body may not be ready to handle that so you get injured but, as long as you practice safe weight training techniques.  As for hurting your kidneys, it would do that for anyone not taking the supplement correctly.  Just drink water in excess. When ever you feel thirsty drink.  <br>  After two months of research and hearing experiences from friends I tried it.  Muscle Tech Cell-Tech.  I had great results.  My bench is now 190 i am faster, and stronger then ever before.  From my experiences the only side effects I had were minor headaches and bloating.<br>  <br>  Just remember that you want to take breaks in between.<br>  1st week - Loading stage 20g/day<br>  2-4 week - Maintenance stage 5-10g/day<br>  5-6 week  - Off<br>  <br>  Repeat<br>  <br>  This will make sure your liver will produce natural creatine phosphate. It will give your kidneys a chance to produce adenosine tryphosphate (ATP).

You'll feel full with fewer calories on them. Fruits, vegetables and fibers are packed with nutrients but less on calories. <br>  <br>  I lost 10 pounds in just 2 months using these tips.<br>  <br>  Here are Tips to help speed up your metabolism plus help you lose weight. they worked for me =)<br>  <br>  1. Fill up on Fiber and Lose Weight Fast<br>  <br>  Fill up on Fiber - Foods rich in fiber will make you feel satisfied and help curb your appetite, helping you to lose weight fast and safely - so make sure to pack your diet with fruits, vegetables and whole grains.<br>  <br>  2. Boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50% by sipping coffee<br>  <br>  Sipping coffee before a meal can supress appetite by 35%, plus boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50%, according to extensive research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The sudy-proven dose : 250 mg of caffeine daily, taken either in supplement form or by sipping to cups of coffee or 4 cups of tea.<br>  <br>  3. Lose Weight just by eating Yogurt<br>  <br>  Yogurt is a calcium-rich food. Research links calcium with lower cortisol production, and it has been proven that women who increase they're intake lose up to 40% more weight than calcium avoiders.<br>  <br>  Plus Yogurt has live microorganisms which helps proper digetion and absorption of nutrients we take. Make sure to get yogurts that says "with live microorganisms in labels/packages". <br>  <br>  4. Try this Hunger-Taming Trick<br>  <br>  Cut fat and you'll cut cravings. Consuming a high-fat diet may supress your body's natural satiety signals, according to a new study from Pennsylvania State University. Animals who'd been consuming a diet rich in fat ended up eating 40% more of a high-calorie snack than those on average diets. Keep your fat intake to less than 30% of total calories.<br>  <br>  5. Feel full on less food.<br>  <br>  Apples are rich in pectin, a soluble fiber that slows the digestive process, so you'll feel full on less food.The result: You'll eat just enough food to make you happy, reducing calorie intake.<br>  <br>  6. Studies suggest people pursuing a healthy weight could lose more weight and burn more fat by including 24 ounces a day of low fat or fat-free milk in their reduced-calorie diet. Instead of 8 ounces or less.<br>  <br>  7. Speed fat burn with Cranberries. The ascorbic acid in cranberrieshelps thin liver bile, making it easier for the organ to emulsify fat so so it can be quickly flushed out of the system rather than stored in cells.<br>  <br>  8. Boost your protein intake and lose almost a pound a week without hunger. You can try protein smoothies. Packed with nutrients and low in calories, smoothies are a fast, easy and great tasting way to achieve good health.<br>  <br>  You can find a wide collection of healthy fruit smoothies at : <a href="http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com</a><br>  <br>  By boosting your protein intake from the typical 15% of total calories to 30%, you may be able to cut your daily calorie intake by 440-enough to lose almost a pound a week without hunger, according to a recent University of Washigton study. "A high-protein diet appears to fool the brain into thinking you've eaten more than you have," says the study's lead author, Scott Weigle, M.D., a professor of endocrinology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Stick with lean protein rather than high-fat, artery clogging meat and dairy products. For breakfast, use low-fat milk instead of water in your oatmeal and sprinkle nuts on top. Eat plenty of beans, fish and skinless chicken breast.<br>  <br>  9. To counteract a binge, keep your body's fat-burning furnace running on full blast by drinking Green Tea. Green Tea contains caffeine and the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) , which is proven to boost metabolic rate. In fact, in a recent 3 month study, participants who took Green Tea extract lost 4.6% of their body weight without changing their diet. To get the benefit, drink at least 3 cups a day. <br>  <br>  Whenever I ate too much, I just drink green tea and I don't have to worry gaining weight.<br>  <br>  10 Speed weight loss and double energy levelsby eating Coconuts.<br>  <br>  This tropical treats contain medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a unique fat that is shuttled straight to the liver and immediately burned for fuel. Research shows this little detour revs metabolic rate by up to 50%, speeding weight loss and doubling energy levels<br>  <br>  <br>  More of these Fast Weight Loss Tips Safely from: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.braveh...</a>|`|QYzelL2oaa	My field is in fashion, as a result many people ask me how they can slim down.

That seemed to work smashingly for him!<br>  <br>  Um, I wouldn't suggest trying to lose weight this way though.  It's hard on your esophogus and could turn into bulimia which is a serious eating disorder.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water before you eat little meals throughout the day.  No big meals. Stay away from lots of simple sugars found in candies, cakes, cookies, and sodas.  Fruits & veggies & whole grains.

Te voy a decir la neta. Siendo que acabas de entrar al gym y tu cuerpo no esta acostumbrado a los ejercicios que vas a estar haciendo, super en chinga tu cuerpo va a responder y vas a subir pero bastante rapido de musculo, CREEME. El motivo es porke al hacer pesas le estas haciendo "dano" al musculo, estas rompiendo, a una escala microscopica (para ke no te asustes) las fibras musculares. Tu cuerpo va a responder inmediatamente creando nuevas fibras mas grandes y mas fuertes, si le pegas de ahorita a finales de septiembre unas 4 veces a la semana con una rutina bien establecida y SUPER IMPORTANTE, haciendo los ejercicios bien, de la manera correcta, no kieras levantar peso de mas, como dicen por ahi, menos es mas. Enfocate en estimular los musculos y no en levantar lo mas ke puedas. <br>  Dicen que al entrar al gym debes de dejar tu ego en la puerta. Tambien te va a dar mucha hambre, y tienes que comer siempre que tengas hambre, y hasta cuando no, si hasta ahorita nadamas comes 2 o 3 veces al dia, empieza a comer 4 o 5 y veras que rapido incrementas musculo. <br>  <br>  Si no me crees preguntale a cualkier wey mamado que veas en el gym cuanto subio de peso el primer mes o dos meses que entreno en su vida y vas a ver que te van a decir alrededor de 10-20 libras. Cuando yo empeze en el gym pesaba 140lbs, despues de un mes pesaba 155, y ahora despues de 3anyos peso 185lbs.  <br>  <br>  Es mucho mas dificil incrementar musculo para las personas que ya llevamos tiempo entrenando que para los principiantes, por lo mismo ke te explique anteriormente. Mi cuerpo ya esta acostumbrado al ejercicio y para hacerlo crecer tengo que recurrir a metodos nuevos, rutinas mas intensas, etc, pero tu, que vas empezando, no te desanimes con los comentarios de estos losers. Deja que pasen dos semanas y la gente te empieze a preguntar si estas levantando pesas, te vas a sentir king kong. <br>  <br>  NO se te olvide, come 5-6 veces al dia, una dieta balanceada nada exagerado y pegale al fierro por lo menos 4 veces a la semana una sesion de mas o menos 1 1/2 a 2 horas. de aki a finales de septiembre te vas a ver mas mamey, (claro, no como arnold, eso toma anyos, pero la gente lo va a notar, neta.). Suerte!

Specifically, Apple Cider Vinegar, Green Tea (decaffeinated), Chlorophyll (fantastic cleanser), and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people (although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get).<br>  <br>  All that being said, it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last pill (it's never as long as it feels like it is).

My face got irritated and the following day my face went so itchy..I never tried it again. Maybe a lot of people tried it and worked for them but not my case. Or maybe it really works for acne-prone skin types cause i remember it was the same supplement the dermatologist has recommended my freind to treat her acne.

8mk2SYs8aa	If you're really not that strong you need to start with something low. At the end of each month you should increase the weight that you are lifting by about 5 pounds or you can just do even more reps (ex: lift the weights 150 times instead of 100). usually you'll feel the need to change the intensity of the workout because you won't feel satisfied. You know you had a good weight lifting excericise when it is difficult to bend your arms straight. If you're at a young age (in your teens) be careful about how much you lift as it could stunt your growth. also you need to keep your body balanced. it isn't great to have huge biceps and no leg muscles what so ever (but you must have leg muscles covered since you are a cross country runner).  You can also try doing pushups as this builds pecs and shoulders.|`|nkmhsUWqaa	if you feel like adding weight try using some protein it does work
KFtZ1lLmaa	Growth delay /growth retardation  and or dwarfism due to genetic cause could be tested by some blood test. We have <br>  1.  Growth hormone Level- stimulation test using some chemical injected through the IV route. The main reason for this is to produce hypoglycenia and the body would react by releasing GH. It should be > 10.<br>  2 Thyroid - TSH, T3, T4 .  Children with Down syndrome have associated hypothyroidism or decrease leve;s of thyroid.  This hormone helps in metabolic state of one body. <br>  3 Pulsatile Growth test while sleeping.<br>  4.Levels of IGF-1 . <br>  5. Not a blood test- Left hand bone x-ray to determine bone age.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to see your doctor there .  Enroll your child in special child or gifted child program. Get also to know some of the support groups that is around your area.|`|V66YUXL7aa	As I know from some cases I have seen, Down's itself causes growth retardation. I don't think it is same as 'dwarfism' that is usually caused by achondroplasia among other conditions like pituitary or thyroid hypofunctioning in children.<br>  In Down's syndrome, usually physical as well as mental growth is retarded so child will look much smaller than actual age, but won't be having characterstics of dwarfism or achondroplasia. Given more time she will grow to adult height/weight and to a variable extent, mental age.|`|5d06fa90b4817948d3e791ccce41e768aa	Summary<br>  <br>  Disease characteristics.  Achondroplasia is characterized by abnormal bone growth that results in short stature with disproportionately short arms and legs, a large head, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and mid-face hypoplasia. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually normal, although compression of the spinal cord and/or upper airway obstruction increases the risk of death in infancy.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis/testing.  Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals who may be too young to diagnose with certainty or in individuals with atypical findings, molecular genetic testing can be used to detect a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Such testing detects mutations in 99% of affected individuals and is available in clinical laboratories.<br>  <br>  Management.  Recommendations for management of children with achondroplasia include monitoring of height, weight, and head circumference; measures to avoid obesity; MRI or CT for evaluation of severe hypotonia or signs of spinal cord compression; adenotonsillectomy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by nasal mask, and tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; suboccipital decompression as indicated for lower-limb hyperreflexia or clonus and central hypopnea; surgery to correct spinal stenosis, and educational support in socialization and school adjustment.<br>  <br>  Genetic counseling.  Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Over 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with normal stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo gene mutation. Such parents have a low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with normal stature has a 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having normal stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. Prenatal molecular genetic testing is available.|`|a6TdaE3Uaa	some children are very short but not to worry she is probably just a late bloomer or just born small this happens to alot of pple so she probably isnt a dwarf because she would be very chubby as a baby and short as she gets older but i have a friend who id only 3feet tall but she is only in middle school but still short for a 8th grader so she will either stay short or as she go about the age of sixteen or so get many growth spers and become very tall that is probably why your docter wasnt concerned

If it is Major Depression, then you can feel pretty normal and then something can set you off and you'll spiral down.  Symptoms of that can be irritibilty, sleeplessness or sleeping too much, loss of appetite or eating too much, crying and/or feeling sad for most of the days, more days than not, sometimes headaches or stomach aches.  Not being interested in things you used to like and isolating...these are symptoms of Major Depression. <br>  <br>  If it is more like a constant, ongoing, underlying sadness...you never feel suicidal, but you just feel blah and lethargic and uninterested in life as whole and it has been this way for at least 2 years, then you might have dysthymic disorder.<br>  <br>  The other type of depression is Major Depression associated with bi-polar - which also has a manic or hypomanic state with it. For that, you need to see a doc.  If you think you are depressed...tell your family doc or a counselor or someone.

e43a03c45d246f7ed32ed68106be01d5aa	I am overweight too, and last year I had knee injury. From that I found out I have arthritis in both knees. I had never had any pain in either knee. The doctor said it is common for someone to come in with an injury, get xrayed and find that out. I will be having knee replacement sometime soon on one knee. There is one exercise I am supposed do to build up the muscle surrounding the knee before surgery that may help you now to keep your knees healthy while you are young. You sit in a chair, like a dining room straight backed chair, lift one leg slowly until it is straight out , then slowly lower it back down to the floor. Then do that with the other leg. The repeat until you have a rep of 10 with each leg. Do these once or twice a day every day if you can and I would think the building up of the muscles surrounding your knees will help you. There may be more exercises if you want to look for them. I would go to a website that deals with knee replacement , then look for pre-op knee exercises or maybe google something along that line. Good luck and I hope I have helped you.|`|AA11270626	Most Definetly!

If you just did some sort of activity that put stress on your knee it could just be sore from that.

QmbEp1rfaa	Tranquilo!! es algo normal en cualquier tipo de relaciones!!!, al principio de la relación uno está embelesado con el cuerpo del otro, es natural, es un terreno desconocido!! con el tiempo uno lentamente va cayendo, no sé si en una rutina, pero si en un grado de confianza que hace que uno se sienta mas comodo con el otro, comparta otras cosas y el deseo no sea tan grande ni tan urgente, y no está mal, al contrario!!.<br>  <br>  Creo tambien que deberías hablar con tu pareja, quizás esté preocupado por algo  o estresado (es re comun a esta altura de la fecha) entonces su deseo baje un poco, pero si como vos decís te mima aunque no tengan sexo, entonces el amor sigue intacto!!<br>  <br>  No creo que para vos sea "todo sexo" sino que son 2 personas con necesidades diferentes, hay personas mas sexuales que otras y no está mal!!.<br>  <br>  Como dije, el dialogo es super importante, conversalo con él, hacele ver tus necesidades y entendé las suyas y si el sexo no es tan bueno como esperás... ?para que tenés boca corazon? deciselo!! contale las cosas que te gustan, tus puntos eroticos, no existe el mal sexo, solo la falta de conocimiento del otro, nada mas, si hablás con él acerca de las cosas que te gustaría probar o hacer, la forma en que querés ser tocado y acariciado, seguro el va a entender como compalcerte!!!<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte!!|`|m6F4Qtp2aa	Puedes completar esa falta de pene con algún juguete sexual.|`|8XjFxIqeaa	Hola Bombón!!!!<br>  <br>  Se nota que lo único que te interesa a vos de un hombre es la cantidad de veces que podrás tener sexo con él.<br>  Además es evidente que has centrado toda la relación en la cama, o sea que cuando la calentura que tenés por el se acabe se va a acabar la relación, y ese es uno de los principales errores que cometemos los gay a la hora de elegir pareja: buscar un juguetito sexual que nos concienta cuando estamos cachondos...<br>  <br>  MUCHO SEXO PERO POCO ROMANTICISMO!!!!!!!

Realmente no pasa nada, mi novio es igual, a veces por stress del trabajo no quiere nada de nada, jajaja, pero eso no quiere decir que no me ame porque me lo dice o me lo hace saber.

y0BZcD6Uaa	Gee, there are some weird answers posted here for this one.  lol<br>  To work your abdominals, you need to do crunches, and variations of it.  Start with 3 sets of as many crunches as you can do, which should be between 10-30, I'm guessing.  Do this for the first week, then build up to adding extra exercises such as knee tucks off the end of a bench (<a href="http://www.netfit.co.uk/assets/004s.jpg)," rel="nofollow">http://www.netfit.co.uk/assets/004s.jpg)...</a>   and even adding weight to your crunches, by holding a heavy book, or a small weight disc (up to 5kgs).  This will allow you to build you abs to a degree that you can see the addominal muscles under your skin, hence, a '6 pack'.    <br>  Make sure you are not eating much sugary and fatty foods, as this will just add body fat, which is the covering over your abs.  Minimal bodyfat means a defined stomach.  <br>  Do some cardio work, too, to help you tone up a little more.  Anything like running for 2-30 mins, 2-3 times a week, will help a lot to achieving a 6-pack even faster.  <br>  It wont take long, within a few weeks, you should start to notice some results :)|`|nyMdy6geaa	WalMart carries a pilates DVD that works wonders.

KfwJDnjUaa	Tendonitis in very simple terms is inflammation of the tendon. All tendons have a covering sheath. When the tendon inflames, it rubs against the inner wall of the sheath which is what causes the pain.<br>  <br>  I know you want to play. But just ask yourself...is it worth an injury that could cause you to limp forever? I think you need to definitely see a doctor and identify the problem instead of guessing the issue and potentially damaging your heel/leg/tendon. <br>  <br>  All the best!<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Contrary to some of the other answers, doctors can help with tendonitis. I had tendonitis in my wrist and my doctor injected the wrist with cortizone. This reduced the swelling within 3 days. Talk to your doctor!|`|1EM6phyDaa	Probably just a stone bruise or a pulled muscle.  Take some ibuprofen if you not allergic to it.  apply a ice pack,  If not better by tomorrow go to the Dr. or school nurse....|`|6bf8c6c7de435f9d652937ce7f9fa148aa	it could be tindonitis you should get it checked out|`|7PJ2H0AOaa	It sounds like tendonitis.  Tendonitis is basically inflammation of the tendon.  Take some Motrin or ibuprofen to help bring the inflammation down and ease the pain.  Take a washcloth and heat it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds and wrap it around your ankle.  That will also help with the pain.  Also, keep your ankle wrapped with an ace bandage.  I have tendonitis in my wrists and when I went to the doctor there wasn't really anything that he could do, other than tell me that.|`|fFauMRadaa	Well for one it might not me tendonitis.  You could have torn a ligament or tendon.  Did you twist your ankle at all?  If you did you could have a sprain, a sprain feels worse than if you had broken it.  I would rather break a bone then have a sprain.  Usually once you have had tendonitis, you will have flare ups here and there.  The only thing you can try is wrapping with an Ace bandage, or buying one of those heel and ankle braces that pull on.  They really help.  Ice it for 20 minutes, then ice it again when needed for the 1st day, then the second day use heat for 20 minutes (soak it, the warmer the better), then start switching off and on with the ice and then the heat.  Take an anti inflammatory if you are not allergic to it, like ibuprofen to take down any swelling and helps with pain.  But, your best bet is to see your doctor as it could be more serious than you think.|`|hmWZcY7jaa	em i really dont no but u should defo get it checked out i mean just think it could seriously harm you in later life. you must be very dedicated to softball but this time i think better safe than sorry. hope this helps

M2hRUObvaa	It's a good start that's for sure!<br>  <br>  I'd change a few things, but your diet is definitely healthy. I like that fact that you're eating frequently, this will keep your metabolism going, which will in turn speed it up.<br>  <br>  A little word of advice that I give clients all the time, if you’re choosing a fruit to eat try and stay away from apples. Even though I am not a carb basher at all, apples have A LOT of carbs and sugar, but some type of fruit is better then no fruit. <br>  <br>  I would maybe replace the apples with a fruit salad made from blueberries (which is a super food) strawberries, bananas (lots of potassium will stop with muscle cramps if you’re working out) and oranges....YUMMY<br>  <br>  I'm glad to see your drinking water, because pop=bad, juice from concentrate=bad, water=good! No GREAT<br>  <br>  Breakfast is good! Special K is formulated for people that are trying to loose weight, and good job with the accurate portion size. <br>  <br>  Other then the apple thing, your nutrition seems solid; make sure you allow yourself a cheat day once a week or your likely to binge eat, or fall off the wagon completely (and fiy, "cheat" day means allowing yourself a reasonable portion of your favourite food, not a whole pizza like we want to eat haha)<br>  <br>  For working out, if your new to the gym, start on a cardio program of 2-4 times a week for 15- 25 minutes, cardio will burn the calories, which will help your body use fat for fuel<br>  <br>  I recommend getting on a resistance program as well to build muscle, since muscle has a higher caloric value then any other tissue (except for neural) so the more you build the more calories you burn when you're playing Halo, or sleeping!<br>  Meet with a personal trainer to make sure your doing proper technique, because if your not you could get injured or not do anything at all :(<br>  <br>  Well, I hope this helps, be sure to check out my fitness blog!<br>  <a href="http://robynfitness.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://robynfitness.blogspot.com/</a>|`|9sTBCvHvaa	thats great! keep doing what ure doing!|`|eTqiLiOfaa	Ya.

5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Sure sounds like gallbladder to me.  It doesn't respect age.<br>  They do it through a small incision now, not like the old days.  There isn't more than two or three tiny little scars that look like scratches.<br>  I had mine out and I never had to modify my diet, although I've heard others do.<br>  Just take it out before it gets really bad, mine went gangrenous during an ice and snowstorm on New Years Eve.<br>  You don't want that to happen to you, the pain is truly incredible.|`|k3OuRLa5aa	it sounds like your gall bladder to me, i am 25 and had mine removed in november, my sister also suffered with it and had hers out a year before i had mine out, my nan also had it, so i think it is passed on through generations, when you go to the doctors demand a scan on your gall bladder, they left me over a year and a half. the operation is so simple and its a releaf compare to the pains you get with gallstones. i also had a lot of wind, before the drs done a scan on my sister they told her she had lactose problems.<br>  <br>  anyway good luck honey
CBJyTMLaaa	I had gallbladder trouble and had mine removed. You do not have to have pain all the time. Your symptoms sound classic, but it is good that you are getting checked by the dr. The dr. explained to me that the gallbladder is like a pouch, and there is a small duct that leads from it to your stomach. The pouch holds bile, and when you eat, it contracts and squeezes bile into your stomach to help with digestion. If you have gallstones, they can get pushed into the duct and block it partially or even fully. The blockage is what causes the pain. Sometimes, it can get infected, but in that case, you would have severe pain and fever. You can function perfectly well without a gallbladder, because bile is always trickling into your stomach. The gallbladder just gives an extra squirt of it when you eat.|`|BUOodnNRaa	It sounds like you very well might have gallbladder problems. No, your gallbladder would not cause you pain all of the time, only when your system has been irritated by fatty foods and such. <br>  <br>  Don't worry and go for the ultrasound and take it from there.|`|vLK9fo7kaa	sounds like classic gallbladder symptoms!no,wont hurt 24/7,but mainly after eating,especially greasy foods|`|852b72f47394e81967453c029679c880aa	it sounds like it maybe gallbladder problems.  my pain was completely different. and it is not a constant pain.  your pains sound text book.  mine were overlooked for a long time as i was not a text book case.  you are ahead of the gang.  the ultrasound will for sure tell you.  but dont worry if you need to get it removed.  laproscopy is amazing!  i have had no problems or pains since having my gallbladder removed other than limiting the things i know will cause problems, which you seem to be keep tracking of already. good luck!|`|AA12181655	You nailed it.  Gallbladder.  Best take care of it now before you end up with a blockage.|`|G4x6htjaaa	I have gallstones now and all your symptoms sound the same as mine but ive stuck to a low fat diet the and have been fine since xmas the dr advised me to eat nothing with more that 4% and its working. ive got to have my pre op on the 15th of this month to have it removed by key hole surgery and am scared to death but at least i know i wont be going to bed each night wondering if i will be woken by that horrible pain! ive never felt anything so bad. hope u get urs sorted but for now just stick to the low fat diet|`|RmlcgNOAaa	okay i have had my gal bladder removed...i was interriable pain..they did a pipta scan and found out it quit working..But mine was not after eating and such. Have you heard about IBS or Chrons? My son had Chrons and that is a big thing. If he eats greasy foods, spicy foods and Orange Juice is a def. big NO NO..<br>  <br>  I will tell you alot of Dr's resort to saying it is something else...Intestential disorders are hard to diagnoise. So if you feel it is something else go see a GI DR. <br>  <br>  but there is a million things it could be. with my galbladder. I did not have pain I got frequent kidney infections though. This may not help much..But if you do not get much back from blood.ask for a EDG and colonoscopy. They can tell more and they can do biopsies while they are in there to check for alot of things. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped you :)|`|VRA6wHo2aa	I jsut had my gallbladder out on March 13th 2008,  I am so glad I did, It was 3 weeks yesterday and the pain is almost complety gone from the surgery,  The ultrasound will only show if there are gallstones, i insisted on a HIDA scan.. THat is the only way they can tell if it is functioning,. Insist on one, they did that and mine was functioning at only 13%.  THey scheduled me for surgery the next day.  Good Luck|`|anAVo3Kpaa	It should not hurt all the time but if you eat greasy foods it will. i know i had to have my gallbladder removed in 1997. everytime i ate greasy foods it would cause severe pain and it felt like my chest was going to explode.  This was caused by gallstones.  while you are waiting to hear what your doc has to say just stay away from anything spicy or greasy.|`|iaAFTtpoaa	That is horrible!!!<br>  I am in seventh grade and we are learning about gallbladders in science|`|kxjxaTYraa	I am 99.9% sure that gallstones. But don't worry. Just stay away from fried and greasy foods and wait for your ultrasound. If they are causing a blockage it might have to be removed. I had mine out last year. It was severly inflammed and was about to rupture. The surgery isn't bad (laproscopic) and only leaves 3-4 small marks. Hopefully you won't need the surgery. Just stay away from beef, greasy and fried foods. Good Luck!!

Please stop now...don't let it take control of your life....or you.  I know it's hard, and I know you can want so bad not to watch it, but still do, It will be a hard habit to break, but YOU CAN DO IT!  I promise....I was addicted for almost 5 years, and now I'm free!  If you have any more questions or need advice or just someone to talk to....please e-mail me at live_laugh_love_737@yahoo.com.  I'll be there to help you, and nothing you could tell me would shock me or make me judge you....I promise!|`|f0ij7Hb2aa	Don't worry about it, kiddo.<br>  <br>  If God doesn't like porn (and I can see a lot of reasons why he might *not*), just don't bother with the stuff.  That'll ease you mind a whole lot from now on, I'm pretty sure.<br>  <br>  I can't *imagine* God thinking that it's wrong to masturbate, though... He made us that way and we can learn how to be better husbands and wives (in the bedroom, at least) by learning about our sexual selves as we masturbate.|`|ZmuXoiScaa	I'm a christian too, and I cannot stand to masturbate, because I'm afraid of disapointing God, too.  But, my friend goes to a Christian school, and they say masturbation is a way accepted by God to release your urges.

zAkPpIjaaa	they can do your entire mouth if you have the money for it. I had it done today on my lower arch. Lets see..first they rub lidocane on your gums, then inject you IN your gums to numb you from side to side. (whole mouth including tounge), the start to clean by chipping away at any calculus and tarter and clean with other instruments. Then they brush your teeth. It doesnt HURT while they are  doing it but your whole mouth is Nuumb for a couple hours afterward. Then the numbness wears off and its sore. I am at hour 4 following the deep cleaning..so we will see how it goes.|`|eRDwzcaOaa	Deep cleanings are normally done when you have periodontal disease, or gum disease, when you have lost bone supporting your teeth.  Gingivitis is the beginning stages of gum disease. <br>  <br>  When they do deep cleanings, they typically will do only the areas where you have lost bone (measured when they do their probe readings- you probably heard them call out numbers between 2-7 when they were doing your exam).  <br>  <br>  Like the other person said, when deep cleanings are done, you normally are anesthetized, so it shouldn't hurt.  Some people elect to have it without anesthetic, but that can be fairly uncomfortable (so just take the anesthetic!).<br>  <br>  Afterwards, your teeth/gums may bleed a little and may be a little sensitive, but that should go away within a few days. <br>  <br>  If you have gum disease, you definitely need deep cleanings.|`|jzLuPouyaa	It's not a very fun process (weird tasted, loud polishing machines, etc.) but the way you feel when you leave makes you never, ever want to put anything in your mouth ever again so that it stays like that forever.

VwnLufUAaa	Antibiotics don't work on viruses. Drink plenty of fluids, take over-the-counter fever reducers, and rest.|`|o4KKBLH7aa	If you have a viral infection antibiotics will be completely ineffectual as they only work against bacteria.  What are you symptoms?  Are you sure you have a viral infection?  <br>  <br>  Paracetamol will help reduce your fever.<br>  <br>  
hxPAIlGUaa	It does seem to get alot worse before it gets better-your sinuses open enough to make you more miserable and your cough subsides enough for your muscles to get sore from the lack of "normal" activity for the past few days.<br>  I'm glad that you think you're at the end of your illness. Remember that any symptoms lasting 3 or more days should be reported to your doctor for his/her opinion on the matter. An acute change in respiratory status or copious secretions (with or without blood present) should be addressed immediately-call 911 or go to your nearest ER.<br>  I hope you feel better soon, God bless!
fMEmQZOUaa	Yes but it is also because you are run down, and lack of sleep with give you cramps too.<br>  Get lots of rest and I hope you feel better soon.
Drewkq4Naa	There really isn't a way to lose weight fast, no matter what people on TV want us to believe.  The real experts agree on this.  <br>  So many of the programs guarantee a vertain weight loss in the first month, and it does work, but not for the reasons they give.<br>  <br>  People new to exercise programs will lose a bit of water weight in that first month just through sweating and the body takes time to adjust.  They also lose inches because most people not already exercising have really lazy abdominal muscles.  Just by being used in a regular workout for a month and those muscles will start tightening up and it looks like you lost belly fat since your waist will be a couple inches smaller.<br>  <br>  Looks impressive, but its just the body's reaction to a new workout, the second and third months most people quit because you are back to real progress.<br>  <br>  But... for your holiday this will work.  Start a good solid workout plan, 4 days a week, good cardio (minimum 20 mins to burn the sugars readily available in your body), good resistance (after the cardio, 30-40 minutes to get into the fat burning) and you wil get those initial results too.  If you cut things like Soft Drinks and gravy, you'll also lose a some pounds of fat in a healthy way.<br>  <br>  It's win-win.  You may not lose all the weight you wanted, but at least you muscles wil look a bit healthier and that goes a long way.|`|3ciZXcthaa	Here is an awesome site that will absolutely help you lose weight fast...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://beyondcardioworkouts.com" rel="nofollow">http://beyondcardioworkouts.com</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  AviB|`|6UHdDmPkaa	walk to every place you need to go.  or run.<br>  <br>  if you start breathing hard, it means that you are doing something.<br>  <br>  follow canada's food guide, and portion control.<br>  <br>  no fad diets at all.|`|k4XLr4TUaa	no junk/ fast food.

1YdeUn1Caa	Like heaven. Enjoyable. You want it more.|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	Depends. Some people love it the first time around. I had to smoke for a while before I started enjoying it, it felt neither good nor bad for me at first. Sometimes people get nauseous the first time. Needless to say, studies show that kids who experience a calming effect the first time they try it are more likely to become smokers, but, weirdly, so are kids who become nauseous! That's because the nausea indicates that they're unusually sensitive to nicotine.<br>  <br>  But -- if I were to say on average -- you'll have a lot of fun, smiling, chatting avidly with your friends and enjoying what you're doing. You'll be having a blast, but it won't necessarily be obvious that it's coming from the cigarette. Your brain will notice, but on a deep level. This is consistent with current research.|`|6og9REH5aa	Both my parents smoked like chimneys, and it was sort of inevitable that I'd smoke too.  So by 17 or 18 I got some cigarettes and figured I'd take up the habit.  Oh man - it was so horrible!  A filthy dry feeling on the tongue and a constantly stuffed up nose.  Lord!  What an odd habit!|`|wRGwWvAkaa	It feels like you shouldnt be doing this but you kind of have to.<br>  Stress can be the main cause for smoking.This becomes very habitual and addictive if you continue to smoke.It makes you fell like your having something that others dont get.But soon that feeling disappears and you can become agrresive when u dont get to smoke<br>  Please by all means do not even light a cigaratte.It is very injurous to your and others health.<br>  It is a easier way of letting your troubles go.It is more disgusting than biting your nails.
SU8z0TUoaa	Step by step: First you get the cigarette lit. When you hold the flame to the tip, suck on the filter a little and blow the smoke out without inhaling.<br>  Then take a few puffs and just blow them out. At this point, it doesn't taste like much.<br>  Now try inhaling. Take a small puff, then open your mouth and breathe in VERY SLOWLY. If you get the urge to cough, put your hand over your mouth and hold your breath until the feeling passes. The do it again. After 4 or 5 puffs like this, you will no longer feel an urge to cough.<br>  Now you can try actually smoking. Take a puff, inhale it, and exhale through your mouth and nose simultaneously. I recommend a light menthol to start with, like a Virginia Slims Menthol Light or Marlboro Menthol Light. The taste and sensation will be pretty intense, probably wonderful. After several inhaled puffs, you will feel the nicotine buzz, and you will love it. After a bit more smoking, though, you will feel dizzy, and if you keep going, nauseous. At this point, stop and wait for the feeling to pass, then smoke again. After four or 5 cigarettes in one day, you will be over this part and you will be able to smoke whole cigarettes without getting dizzy.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!

AubmEoYgaa	Don't take any pain pills for stomach pain. You have a problem with either to much acid, ulcer or just an irritation, which could be from the pain medications that contain aspirin like Advil, Ibuprofen, Aleve. Tylenol if used for long periods of time will affect your liver. It's for headaches, and general pain anywhere except the stomach. You don't say why you are having stomach pain or for how long. If it's just been a day or two, could be as simple as gas, Why don't you try some extra strength Maalox that also contains anti gas. I'm thinking about the gas if you arwe somewhat constipated. If that is the case, some Phillips Milk Of Magnesia will help that. But if the pain has been there for a good while, you should go to the a Doctor and have a check up and get some tests done. Wishing you the very best young lady and I hope your pain goes away as quick as it came.

4cfee734accabf2cf33df95b41ee32d5aa	In order to really burn fat you must do aerobic exercise.  Muscles may show through the fat a bit, depending on how much fat there is.  But you must get rid of the fat to really show the muscle.<br>  Muscle burns more calories than fat does, so weight lifting will help with that, but not as much as aerobic (running, walking, swimming, biking, etc) exercise does.|`|oqiWY1QBaa	afraid to go the gym? how about getting the wii fit? (i did) it is so awesome! believe it or not, it gives you a very fun workout and your muscles will start to show and you will feel them working and the game actually encourages you. =3|`|J6O66K7Gaa	Assuming you have a solid workout routine in place, you stick to it consistently and you have a solid diet plan, then you will see results. However, it will take time to see anything and you'll probably be a little upset with your results for the first 2 months because you will start gaining muscle quicker than you are losing fat. Meaning that for a few weeks (and as long as a few months) you'll get bigger. You will still look better because your bigger won't have a flabby shape - you will start looking like you have muscle under your fat. But your clothing will get tighter for a little while.<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb, you will start seeing major muscle group definition (chest, back, thighs) at around 16% body fat. You won't start seeing your abs until 8-10% body fat.<br>  <br>  But a clean diet is key to getting the muscle to show. It doesn't matter how much muscle mass you have, over 20% body fat will just blur it all and make you look big.<br>  <br>  Luckily the single best way to lose body fat is to gain muscle. Muscle tissue is extremely metabolically active so you'll burn more calories at rest and when working out. Adding in some high intensity cardio will give you a fat burning multiplier for many hours. <br>  <br>  But I'd recommend just getting into the gym. At the risk of being a bit cruel, get over yourself. No one at the gym will care if you are overweight. No one will care that you can barely lift or that you are weak. Seriously. Everyone there is focused on their own workout. And 90% of the people there will be nice. Go in, work hard and ask for help if you need it. Most people there will lend a hand for a spot, give you tips on an exercise or tell you how to improve your form. Odds are they will leave you in peace if you don't ask because thats how the gym culture works. But if you ask you will get help. Plus it is easier to be motivated to work hard when you see other people working hard.|`|1a3Vqo0waa	No.  If you build muscle under the fat, it will certainly be there and you will be stronger, but in order for the muscle to show, you must shed the fat on top of it.   You have to start doing enough activity to burn more calories than you take in during the day and then you will start to lose the fat.  The muscle that you build will help with the fat loss, because muscle burns more calories in a day.  Just make sure that you don't up your calorie intake and negate the effect.  |`|aItbzsPMaa	dude screw the wii. i mean yea its bad *** but it dont help.just do some free weights bench, curl about 3 days a week and sit-ups. about 25 a night. and dnt change your eating habbit at all just turn your fat into muscle. 
d2AzNKEFaa	Were you taking any cold medication to relieve your cold symptoms? Most cold remedies contain an antihistamine that will  dry you out and make you thirsty - your pain is probably due to coughing and you  pulled a muscle - if your symptoms keep up or worsens I would go to the md - and yes - I also have had a bad cold that I have hurt myself coughing and sneezing |`|9pLdhuBnaa	Part of this could be related to the flu (an example only) but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.|`|WCtG8d2Paa	I have it right now.<br>  <br>  I have a cold that is getting better now but the underneath of my upper arms is tender and painful.

Don't be afraid, because todays neurosurgeons and neurologists are very skilled and very knowledgeable.  I came thru a brain aneurysm with surgery to put 2 clips on the bleeding artery thanks to a very smart doctor.  What about your vision.  Do you wear glasses?  Maybe the lens need changed.  What about allergies/sinus pressure?  Have you tried any antihistimines?  Call the doctor first thing in the morning.  Promise?|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	You dont say if you are male or female, if you are female it could be a hormonal migraine, I have them and the only thing that makes them go away is Zomig, but a visit to the doctor would be a good idea, and please do it soon, there is no real need to suffer like this.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of variables with headaches, your diet, do you drink a lot of coffee for instance? did it start suddenly? have you had blurred eyesight? do you see flashing lights? have you had a cold recently? sinus infections cause blinding headaches, maybe a decongestant would help, but go to the doctor anyway!!<br>  <br>  |`|jIufI9Zaaa	i've  had headaches/migraines  daily for years and ive just got used to them. ive had them since i was young so if your have just started recently u should see a doctor as it maybe serious, but dont worry too much about it as it may be nothing (simple chemical/hormone imbalance or excess stress on th neck etc)<br>  <br>  ive been on imagran (and many others) but none have worked very well.

614DONkkaa	Be careful with diet pills--I've had some bad experiences trying some of them. What I did find to work really well though was a natural supplement of Acai berry which I actually saw on Oprah and Rachel Ray. It was a while ago, but I ordered a free sample from <a href="http://ultraacaiberry.com/y/" rel="nofollow">http://ultraacaiberry.com/y/</a> and it's been great for helping increase my energy, metabolism, and keeping my body healthy! I've lost weight and I feel much, much better than I did when I was on the pills.|`|AA12381717	If you are just focused on losing weight fast, you will probably gain it back.  It's a good thing you don't want to use diet pills though.  It's really not a hard formula or anything.  You simply just eat less and exercise more.  I would suggest 30 minutes a day most days of the week.  Also, try to do some sort of weight lifting, maybe 30 minutes 3 days a week.  The muscle you gain from weight lifting will help you burn fat.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's possible to be full without eating a large quantity.  You just need to eat more vegetables, which really keep you full.  Watch your calories.|`|IjKh9BVcaa	Three steps that have really helped me are dieting, exercising, and the correct weight loss supplement for losing weight. Focus on those three things and you will lose weight considerably. I exercise 30 mins a day along with taking Proactol, a natural weight loss supplement that I saved money on at theweightlossplace.com <br>  <br>  Good luck and stay focused = )|`|ZxuuRXI7aa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - eat less and exercise more - the problems arise when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are loads of stumbling blocks out there don't you think?! I learned some splendid information by learning from the web portal in the box below, they have loads of guidance, I lost 10 pounds by following their helpful advice.|`|YS9gHgWuaa	What you want to do is go for a walk as soon as you get up without eating, you will have lower glycogen stores when you wake up so your body will resort to burning fat instead. Also Dont eat 2 hours before bed time, you can also can protein shakes which can replace one meal a day. |`|Zi2TrCtCaa	hope this helps...<br>  <br>  <br>  well im guessing that you buy that food at your house. if you do... then get all the junk out of your fridge and add some good food. buy a lot of salad and fruits. make half of the plate you eat with salad, its okay to add some dressing just make sure you dont get fattening ranch dressing. if you have a smoothie at home i would drink atleast a cup of smoothie a day, just add fruit and some ice on top of that and you will be good. (you should atleast go #2 once a day to the bathroom , eating fruits will help you do this).<br>  <br>  if you ever get hungry just drink a smoothie and you will feel good. or any other healthy snacks.

You just need to get rid of fat and add muscle, since muscle takes up less room than fat.  Do some cardio.  Go for a walk or go biking.  Try to be active most days of the week.  Also start lifting weights, doing lunges, squats, crunches, etc.  You should start noticing a change in a few weeks.|`|Zi2TrCtCaa	hope this helps...<br>  <br>  get all the junk out of your fridge and add some good food. buy a lot of salad and fruits. make half of the plate you eat with salad, its okay to add some dressing just make sure you dont get fattening ranch dressing. if you have a smoothie at home i would drink atleast a cup of smoothie a day, just add fruit and some ice on top of that and you will be good. (you should atleast go #2 once a day to the bathroom , eating fruits will help you do this).<br>  <br>  if you want to lose a size or 2 it is probably safe.... just do it slowly or you could harm your body. just eat healthy first and see if you will lose weight, if that doesnt work just workout a little every day until you see results.|`|AZeC5x42aa	at this age, watch your diet and exercise daily. also, work a bit on muscles. muscle helps your metabolism. but also at this age, you're still growing, so don't do the weights TOO much.|`|0JatB9mtaa	i think ur at a age where ur still growing u need all the nutrition u need and can get,.so dont change ur diet now. it will ruin ur growth patern. ur skinny. dont be anerix now.
AA12381717	You have some great ideas.  You're really on the right track.  I think starting out with 20 minutes of cardio 5 days a week is a good idea.  I would do 20 minutes the first week, 30 the next, etc.  I think that you should do all of the videos.  You should rotate them.  I do know that pilates is a wonderful tool when trying to tone.  I think you could probably meet your goal in 3 months.|`|WIyUKz3raa	The term "overweight" means different things to different individuals. It's a good idea to start at the beginning, and ascertain if you are actually overweight for your size or not, by computing your BMI (Body Mass Index). You can discover how to do it at the web resource in the box below, they have loads of tips and tricks, I lost 6 pounds by taking their advice.
nutp9nwaaa	You need at least 1200 to 1800 cals a day for maintenance.  You may be able to dip to 1000 cals for a few days, but you won't be able to maintain that for very long either.  Reduce your sugar intake and limit your fat cals to about 20 to 30% of total cal intake.  So if your cal intake for one day is 1200, your fat cals would be between 240 to 360 cals.  1800 cals would be between 360 to 540 cals.  A 1000 cal a day diet would have 200 to 300 cals in fat.  Eat only high quality food.  As close to what nature has provided as possible.  In other words forget processed foods.  And plenty of fiber and water to keep things moving internally speaking.  <br>  <br>  P.S.  If you don't provide enough nutrients your body will start cannibalizing itself to provide nourishment to your vital organs.  You can exercise as much as you want, but your muscles will be fodder for your body if you don't ingest enough good protein.  Your liver will start dumping glucose into your system for energy causing your pancreas to dump more insulin to clean up the excess sugars which will damage your pancreas.  You could get a build up of key-tones in  your system making you become dangerously acidified.  You will lose muscle tone, kidney failure, damage to heart, liver, pancreas.  All this could happen in as little as a week.  It is not worth it.  <br>  Follow a sensible eating and exercise program.  For a little insurance take a one a day multivite, don't forget to take extra calcium in a supplement or food source.  My fav is fruit sweetened or plain yogurt.  I hope you find this helpful.  God Bless you.|`|a8IRxC4raa	You might lose none.  When you don't take in enough calories, your metabolism slows down to make maximum use of the calories that ARE eaten.  The result can be no weight loss.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|AA12381717	First of all, you will probably get sick.  Second of all, your body will probably be in shock for those 15 days and you won't lose anything.  If you were to stick with it longer (which I definitely do not recommend), you would lose weight temporarily, and then gain it all back when you go back to eating normal.  If you didn't go back to eating normal, you would probably end up in the hospital.  Your body simply cannot function without it's fuel (food).<br>  <br>  A better idea would be to eat around 1200-1400 calories a day.  Just make sure it's mostly healthy stuff.  If you eat 1400 calories of a big McDonalds meal once a day, you're not going to lose weight.<br>  <br>  30 minutes of exercise a day sounds good.|`|AA10976543	I disagree with the above answerer.  You don't need to eat 1800 calories a day, but you do need to eat at least 1200 calories a day.  If you eat less than 1200 calories, your body will go into starvation mode and you will lose less weight.  Make sure you eat plenty of protein. <br>  <br>   Turkey and chicken slices (deli style) have very low calories, but lots of protein.  So do egg whites.  <br>  <br>  Also, vegetables are a good source of vitamins and fiber, and will fill you up for very little calories.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you stick to your goal of exercising 30 minutes a day! <br>  <br>  If you eat 1200 calories a day and exercise for 30 minutes, I would expect you to be able to lose 5 - 8 lbs in 15 days.  Good luck!  Make sure you find a realistic plan that you can really stick to!|`|Em6TqmFVaa	You won't be able to do this for more than 3 days. That's not enough food to live. <br>  <br>  exercising around 30 minutes a day is a good idea. Eat at least 1800 calories. You'll be noticeably more trim in 15 days if you stick to that. <br>  <br>  And sticking to that might not even be easy.<br>  <br>  300-500 calories a day is a joke.<br>  <br>  You're slightly overweight so you need to adjust what you eat a bit, but it's no big deal-- it's not like you're fat or anything.
8pa1sdvxaa	Maybe you have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, go to the doc and get checked out, good luck!|`|oqiWY1QBaa	because you are sleeping too much. try eating goji berries, they will give you lots of energy from head to toe! they are amazing.|`|yFc6CX23aa	it is possible that you are anemic.

I'm sure you have heard of how girls practice giving***** yep, on a banana!! <br>  <br>  Seiriously though, just relax, first kiss should go like this:<br>  1. Kiss gently, take your face away and look at her in the eyes.<br>  2. Kiss again and this time slowly and gently open your mouth a little bit, A LITTLE BIT!<br>  3. Keep your mouth a little bit and close and pull away slowly, repeat I'm sure you get the idea, NEVER use your tongue until she does, then return the favour!<br>  <br>  I learnt by copying the girl, adapt to every girl you kiss!|`|71d89c0698df3d4fde1a9ccef5b2469aaa	uncertainty, thats all part of the fun! |`|OBpGlEw2aa	some girl don't like that on first kiss, you may have made her mad
oUyif9L0aa	 If people are calling you names it's only because they have their own insecurities. You shouldn't let other people get in the way of how you feel. All that matters is how you see yourself. I know this from experience. If you don't have a good attitude about yourself, you can lose 200 pounds and you still won't think you look good. <br>  <br>   I hope this makes sense to you and I hope you take my advice about learning to love yourself. |`|6b56WFDcaa	Firstly people make hurtful comments because they are insecure themselves and want to feel that they are better than you.  Don't let what others say upset you.  <br>  <br>  If you are overweight though, it is best to take off weight for your health.  If you have some sort of problem, like a hormone inbalance, this can be very difficult.  Have you seen a nutritionalist?  Do you eat healthy foods?  Do you exercise enough?<br>  <br>  Believe in yourself.  Look at some Rubens  paintings.

T7p9TYrAaa	It can affect you, specially if you oftenly do it. It happened to me once, if you do it frequently, you are constantly motivating the muscle, it's like doing push ups all the time, in the end if you over do it, you will not only get tired, if not, it will also hurt.<br>  <br>  It is good to do it sometimes, but trust me, it is good to learn to control it, and not overdo it. Overdoing it may cause problems such as:<br>  <br>  - Tiredness, sleepiness during the day.<br>  - For some reason, somehow contradicting the previous one, it may cause insomnia.<br>  - Wanking too often, or too frequent "e.g. everyday, or not giving it at least a day to rest" may cause pain in the testicular area, irritation, sometimes inflammation, including redness and sullenness.<br>  - Give it at least 1 day between rounds, it feels better "stronger" and you don't hurt yourself, YES, you are hurting yourself when you sometimes overdo it, specially if you don't give it a rest, this may be what's causing your problem.<br>  - It can also cause problems when urinating "there is a bladder related issue, I forgot how to link it but I think that when you ejaculate, you feel as if you were... peeing, thus, sometimes you push harder in order to feel better, sometimes, without wanting it, forcing the bladder to work when ti does not has to, thus "like what happened to me once" reducing the amount of urine your  bladder can hold"<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and if you **** too often, yeah it will hurt, wait a day or two in between. If you're hurting too much, give ia a week's complete rest, it will go away in time, but you need to rest. Anyway if the problem persists even after you waited 1 whole week, you may want to contact a doctor, but don't worry too much, something similar happened to me, and I'm fine, they just chopped off my pen!s... lol kidding, but don't worry, it may be muscle exhaustion.|`|p5wTtH3taa	I don't think it'd be anything to worry about, after ejaculation your body has a peak in mental activity, and your symptoms are probably due to mental exhaustion. its not harmful so worry not. If you get really dizzy, or get bad headaches then it could be something a little more mild. |`|9Mf8uzcSaa	Its normal it happened to me 3 years ago|`|MU0gh8IFaa	do not worrry but do not over do at a stretch

c97f29a57d4e5a8b3ed896d65b238ff6aa	Floor hockey would be more important, because the same amount of force exerted on both a soccer ball and a hockey puck would have the hockey puck going faster.<br>  <br>  Plus, since a person can theoretically swing a hockey stick faster than someone can kick a ball, the hockey puck would move at an even greater velocity. Both sports require it, but a hockey puck in that region would be absolutely horrendous.|`|3exab8jnaa	I would say both. <br>  <br>  If I had to choose, I would say indoor soccer, only because of the kicking, etc near your groin area.

The only other suggestion would be to turn on a fan in the room for the constant noise. It may help drown out some of the complete silence to extreme loudness that's preventing you from even thinking you can sleep through it. It should help you focus less on the snoring at least.|`|SUOUfeisaa	Foam Snoring Earplugs are effective: Foam earplugs are the most common from the three. Some use a foam that retains its shape for nearly a year. You place it in, it takes the shape of your ear and after taking it out, it retains its old shape. This type of snoring earplug lets you hear everything including the snoring.<br>  <br>  These earplugs can fall out of the ear while sleeping and are also uncomfortable for the wearer.

There are pills you can take to stop the snoring. It also could be the possession he is sleeping.

Kxi8iFJYaa	I really feel for you, I also suffer from ovarian cysts and the pain can be unbearable. I was taken to hospital with one around 8 years ago and I was sent home after being told it was a kidney infection! I ended up in so much pain that my doctor organized an appointment with a gynecologist later that day and I was in surgery the next morning. As far as I am aware, a proper diagnosis cannot be given unless they perform exploratory surgery. It sounds as though you are not being taken seriously and my advice would be to get a second, or even a third opinion and keep going until you are happy with the outcome. After all, you are the one in pain and its your body so you have to stand up for yourself and get to the bottom of it.

I would recommend first finding the maximum number you can do with a normal hand position, hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Then I would perform sets of different forms of push-ups, such as hands in, hands wide, feet on a bench, feet on a medicine ball, one hand on an elevated object, and when you work up to it, push off jump and clap.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Way too many.

AA11724685	It may help with losing weight, but personally I think it tastes awful. And, if something tastes awful, you can only eat/drink it for so long before you just can't take it anymore. So, it may help to begin with, but if it's not something you like the taste of, it won't do any good in the long term.  In addition, although fruit is healthy for you, adding in the fruit and milk also means adding in more calories. Keep that in mind.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|UbU0uIbeaa	I don't like Slim fast b/c once you stop it you gain all the weight back.

The best part... it definitely tastes better than slim fast. Juice and a good diet and I'm very happy with the results.

uLvZc3eGaa	You could try cardio like running and sprinting.  If you just run about 2 miles every other day, or three times a week, I think you'd notice a difference and wouldn't lose muscle.  When I run, I feel it in my abs.  Cardio is good as a balance to weights.<br>  <br>  You might also check your diet.  Do you drink soda and eat sugary foods at all?  Try cutting all sugar and soda (even diet) out for 2 weeks and see what happens.  <br>  <br>  Prevention.com has a flat belly diet that is really popular.  I haven't done it myself as I haven't needed it.  But the link is below.  I don't think you can get the whole thing on the site, but the basics are there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I hoped this helped.|`|AA12105454	you have to have it in order to transmitt it.|`|mW2HP40Raa	ok i agree with the other posters. yes you have to have an STD in order to pass one to another person. STDs dont arise out of thin air.    but:    there are instances that can become confusing. for example, HPV (genital warts). HPV is passed from contact with skin. so, you could potentially contract (get) this infection without having intercourse. in which case, you could then pass the virus to another person.     another example of mystery contraction of an SDT is the spread of herpes. first of all, you could pass oral herpes that you have had forever on to your partners genitals if you have oral sex. also you could sort of carry the herpes virus and now know it. some people are infected with herpes and the virus can be found on their skin, but they never develop a sore (or they dont have a sore at a particular time). anway, a person can inadvertently pass herpes along.    ok TMI. im long winded.|`|YCeI6auxaa	no. one person just has to have had sex before.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	You have to have an STD before you can pass one on.
77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	If your voice is scratchy, you are using the wrong technique.  A sensation of scratchiness comes from damage to the thin, gelatinous covering on the vocal folds ("cords"). The next phase is being unable to reach high notes because that covering isn't there to give the preciseness of vibration of the cords. Following that one tends to push harder and clear one's throat a lot. This sets up the vicious cycle of voice abuse; throat clearing, coughing, singing loudly, etc.   Cords which are abused become swollen, giving the sensation that there is something in one's throat when there is nothing there. Once that sets in, your voice will have less range and you will become hoarse and breathy. Voila- nodules (which, ironically, form to protect your vocal cords from further damage).  Vocal sound (voice) is produced by the power source (lungs) rushing past the vocal cords and sucking them together (Bernoulli Effect), which causes them tp vibrate.  The cords thin and lengthen to produce high pitches, and thicken  and shorten to make low-pitched sounds.   Nodules develop when the cords bang together due to vocal strain. They do not form if air sets the cords into vibration without the effort of straining; that's why singers can do 8 shows a week without destroying their voice.   You admit to "pushing it" in order to gain loudness, when it's far better to take a huge breath and use your abdominal and lower back muscles to push, rather than using your throat. This will also give you more control over all loudness levels.  Any tightening of the throat is not what you want. Your throat should feel open and relaxed.  Stop singing for the rest of the week. Your cords aren't terribly damaged at this point and may recover completely by Friday if you use your voice as little as possible by avoiding the following voice-damaging behaviors:  Talking too loud  Using a "stsge" whisper  Coughing  Clearing your throat  Laughing  Humming  Yelling    Good luck with the competition!|`|6EocUFbhaa	no its just that cold thats been going around. about my everyone at my school stayed home at least for one day the past 2 weeks. and this one kid has a solo for mpas this week and he might not perform it cuz hes well enough to go to school but too sick to sing.

oGyL9WJ1aa	Are you getting braces or already have them? Save yourself the thousands of dollars and get your front teeth bonded. I am surprised that not that many people know about bonding...Your dentist will mix a little tooth colored composite and fill in the gap making it look like both sides of your teeth are bigger. It costs about $120.00. Please look at this link below.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	depends..maybe 6 months.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	it wouldnt take long at all, probably a few days.  braces are put on fairly tight, and move the teeth generally  quickly when there are small gaps.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Depends. There are other methods of filling the 'Gap'.    You can have bonding. Or if your other teeth might be crooked, then braces is the way to go.    You should really consult your dentist. They will tell you the best method.|`|j2sxi6Gvaa	Well before I had braces, there was a tiny gap there. Then the gap got wayyyy bigger after the put the braces on. Today I went to the orthodontist and they put  a power chain on the gap and it's already fully closed...... Basically, it depends on your situation....|`|XeUT8qABaa	Only a few days usually. It could take more. But... you do know that braces stay on for a few years?

Others just see it as a job.No one is MAKING them do that, its completely their choice, so I see no reason to feel bad for them.    I'm not a big fan of porn either, its very fake and the stars look so worn out its gross.

Gay is being attracted to men.  What it DOES mean is that you're honor-system is way higher than a lot of other guys (not judging people who do porn btw).

I know my future wife wouldn't want me looking at that anymore than i would want her looking at another guy.|`|n26Lb0Qcaa	No it doesn't make you gay, it makes you human.

You are born that way if you are.  Second what about the men? They chose to do it too.  And no woman has the forced on them, each and everyone choses that. Just like the men.

They like it. There's nothing wrong with that.|`|fDqCPBP3aa	No, of course you are not necessarily gay. You are just a man with very high moral standards and you feel that a female must never be exploited. Good for you.
O6SaytDUaa	Hi there,    I got the Implanon implant fitted in 2004 after i had my little girl. I had it in for almost 3 years but decided i fancied a change and switched to the Depo Provera injection.    My experience of being on the implant was completely fine, my periods were irregular to begin with but after about 4-5 monthes then settled down and i bled lightly for around 2 days every month. I had no pain or weight gain.    So no, you're not the only one who doesn't hate it. I just think some people have different experiences on it. I only switched to Depo because i was due to get a tattoo in the same place where the implant was fitted and was advised to have it removed before the tattoo could go ahead.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	If its the same as Norplant then I had a good experience with it. There is a tiny scar where the rods were inserted & taken out of my arm but my periods were fine while it was in situ. I would recommend it.

You need to be sleeping at least 8 hours. if you cut off the the sleep time by 1 hour, you'll feel tired because you did not let your body and your mind rest enough. Making it up in the next sleep won't help either. Again, you need to be consistent with this. It doesn't matter if you sleep during the day or at night.

Family physicians are also an excellent resource for therapeutic referrals to local ADHD specialists.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I don't think anger management issues and stress are directly due to ADHD....|`|nci2WOYXaa	Yeah, I go through the same thing.

2wMMAKpOaa	No you're not fat at all. In fact that's normal. Guys would prefer to have a girl with some curves on her than a toothpick trust me. But if you feel that your stomach is bothering you then just do a few sit-ups everyday. It doesn't have to be a lot but it will help tone.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|rtrdOcTcaa	You're not fat at all.  If your chest is big for your age, good for you - big chests help males notice you.  Also, fat on hips and stomach is normal - I have the same thing.  It just gives a girl some curves and makes her look mature.  But yeah, if you want to get rid of fat content and not necessarily lose weight, do sit-ups or crunches or run or something.  The exercises for your abs don't always get rid of the fat on top of them, but make your abs flex more, which makes you look more toned.  Running can melt fat away from all over your body, making it an efficient fat loss exercise.<br>  <br>  I'm not as thin as everyone else either - even though I'm 5'2" and 105 pounds and 0.4 BMI points away from being underweight, I wear a size 4.  My hips are just fairly wide, that's all.

It's not much fun, but don't worry, when you get your first period its not heavy, but if you want to be prepared carry around tissue. This can help as a pad of some sort.

fDqCPBP3aa	It is very possible. The viewer might get ideas that he/she never had before, depending upon the content of the pornography.|`|ONRpcM82aa	I does in deed.  What you will witness probably never came across your mind before and you will be eager to find out what its like.  Its just human nature.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	More than likely.     What is often missed from the equation that pornography is 'bad/immoral' etc is the understanding that it's the marketplace which is at fault; no buyers/viewers would mean no product to peddle.|`|irIk1saFaa	it might|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Sure.  Often, in porn, women will do things that "normal" women wouldn't do in real-life situations. Not to be feminist or anything, but sometimes men develop fantasies that involve a woman doing things that they typically wouldn't feel comfortable with, and it's unrealistic.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	I believe so. The human body naturally gets sexually aroused. Some times when we watch sexy/seductive material it causes us to be aroused. But pornography opens up a whole new window. Pornography invites us to ideas that normally our minds wouldn't be exposed to. Lets say the fantasy is a guy cheating on his wife with a neighbor. All you see is the pleasure from the sexual activity. You don't see the family or the wives that are affected by the cheating. I'm not saying that without pornography none of the things we see wouldn't happen, it just invites us to new opportunities. It plays on out natural behavior of being curious and liking new things. It creates a fantasy world, that people watching often try to recreate.|`|AA10331437	It does and always has in my case!  It is also very very addictive!|`|Fgz5xWxOaa	it could open up new ideas that maybe were never thought of before, but I don't think it changes a person's preference (like a fantasy they thought was horrible, then watch porn and want to try it.)    But its not a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with wanting to try new things to spice up your love life!|`|EvDwQXJ7aa	I only look at it in hopes of one day seeing your picture in it
GWRP3vLQaa	You don't have to LOVE yourself, you just have to like yourself and be comfortable in your own skin. You have to be able to recognize and appreciate your good points, and working on those that aren't so good. Even if you figure out who you are today, by tomorrow or 10 years from now you won't be the same person you are today. You are a work in progress, as we all are.  <br>  <br>  Economics and business may not be your passions, but most people don't have the luxury of following their true passions. At least you aren't majoring in flower pressing, tatting or something like that. You have chosen a field that will have a good potential for providing you with the kind of life  that following your true passions might not do. Also, you might find yourself getting into another field altogether. This happens a lot. As a former personnel interviewer, I know that a degree can be used in many ways, and your degree could eventually help you start your own business doing whatever you are passionate about.<br>  <br>  At 21, your passions and emotions are likely to be all over the place because you are - well, 21. Once you can get past worrying about what is going to become of you and realize that you are going in the right general direction in life, perhaps you can start focusing on other people more and what makes them tick. When that happens, you will probably find yourself making plenty of friends.<br>  <br>  God bless you and Good Luck.|`|6fjMtWboaa	You need to see yourself from God' perspective.  He sent His only Son, Jesus to die on a cross for you and me.  You were created in God's image and with that there are no mistakes.  You are who you are because God has designed you to be that way.  I didn't know who I was either until I came to follow Christ.  It's not about how religious one can get but rather a personal and committed relationship with Jesus.  You are loved!  Remember to have a friend is to be a friend and for Christ, being a friend meant going the distance.  I believe that you have a desire to change otherwise you would not have asked.  I think you can do this.  By learning to love yourself and God, everything else will fall into place, you have to trust me on this.  Now this is what you need to do.  Pray this prayer.<br>  <br>  “Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.”|`|j6sDX5H9aa	well ur the only one feeling like that, there are other people in colleges feeling the same way.

There are plenty of reasons to love yourself, and I agree that you should feel like you love yourself before you start pursuing other relationships -- otherwise you risk getting sucked into a bad relationship because you could feel like it's your only source of love.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you might be depressed.  Sometimes depression isn't just a matter of feeling "sad" .. many times people who suffer from depression feel lost, apathetic, or just don't get joy out of anything specific.  I do think that you should find someone to talk to about your feelings, like a counselor.  If you are a student, I am sure your college has resources to help you.<br>  <br>  You should love yourself ... just because you don't know where you want to be in the future doesn't mean that there aren't good aspects about you.  You have potential, and you care enough about your place in the world to want to figure it out.  So many people never even bother to consider who they are or what they want to do.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you ought to find a volunteer organization that appeals to you and spend a few hours a week doing something good.  If nothing else, you can be satisfied that you are doing something good for the world, and you might find some self esteem in that.<br>  <br>  Good luck -- I truly hope you find a way to love yourself.|`|f8f559850d31cb028b52782b5299ed19aa	this is lame but my zodiac sign helped me a bit realize that im already a person with its own passions and stuff.<br>  although i think that not many people will be sure of who they are themselves yet at 21.<br>  you develop into all that stuff when you get experience after experience i reckon.|`|vRKOxGfnaa	there are a lot of people who dont know what they want they want in life just experiment with different things im sure you'll find something|`|J9HEPVdaaa	you have to be yourself. so be it.

PGkR813Jaa	If you feel Ok and the pain/discomfort is not too bad there is no reason why you can't play sport.    Just remember to keep up drinking fluids especially while playing softball.    If you believe you have a kidney infection you will need to see a Doctor for antibiotic treatment. As when it enters the kidneys it is not longer able to just be treated with OTC treatments.|`|QtLRr6kLaa	First let me say sorry for the possibility but you will be ok :p You probably won't be able to play sports for awhile, but after a little while you most likely will. Your doctor will be able to tell you what you could and couldn't be able to safely do better than i. But as long as you play it safe and listen to your doctor you should be able to.|`|PxAbHx0Waa	yes you can play sports but first clear it with your doctor|`|el8yX5q3aa	If you have a kidney infection you will know it.  High fever, pain and vomiting and it takes a couple weeks to get rid of it. When you do...you can play sports..it is an infection like any other.  But it does need a doctor's help and medication.   Believe me...if you have  kidney infection you WON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING!    Believe me..if you have one...you will know it.     When I had mine I was almost in convulsions over the fever...it is very difficult to get through.|`|qjHUuwIXaa	If your doctor says it's OK.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	get it diagnosed and ask the doctor all pertinent questions before you leave the office.
al0cCPb6aa	Pilates is a much better cardio type work out...you will feel a burn from pilates...I would do yoga too though because it improves your balance and flexibility...I think they are a perfect combination.|`|EevMUAqJaa	Pilates. It burns more calories.  Pilates is a class that focuses on your body, and yoga is a class that helps you get peace of mind.
i7Ve5KbGaa	Ugh, I get this all of the time! It's most likely a gas pocket or possibly could have something to do with the gall bladder (not serious). It's caused by food. Mine is because I am lactose intolerant and I suffer from IBS. If I eat too much dairy or greasy food it triggers it and I am absolutely miserable. One time I almost went to the hospital the pain was so bad. But I would definitely recommend going to the doctor because everyone is different.|`|6pbUwvhEaa	I would say no because I have also sometimes have a pain exactly like what you have described, but I have no appendix anymore.  But I am also not a doctor, I just can sort of relate to what you feel.  My answer would be to go see a doctor or if you don't think it's that serious just mark on like a calendar when it happens to you, and if the pain starts happening more regularly I would definitely seek medical attention.    Also would you please answer my question.  Just click on my profile and go to questions and it should be there.  It's about Drug Tolerance.  Sorry I could not be that much help|`|QvrhmdAtaa	I have been going through the same thing since I was a little child.I was diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia. They are known to be extremely painful.I would recommend you be seen as this is just one of a variety of conditions the symptoms you're describing suggest. My 24 year old daughter now has these same symptoms and for her it seems to be severe gas attacks but she won't go in and it's not advisable to just make guesses when it comes to your health. If you're appendix were acting up you would be noticing the area over the appendix getting warm/hot to the touch and fever.You usually would not be going through appendicitis for years and you would have been hospitalized long ago as the rupture following the onset of appendicitis usually produces vomiting and seriously life threatening,even fatal toxins to be released into the body.It is a highly dangerous infection which makes most people violently ill.Unless you're showing the signs of some sort of an infection with these bouts of symptoms,it's pretty safe to say it's not your appendix. Like I said though,it may be any number of conditions which also vary in severity so I highly recommend you get in and be diagnosed properly. It may be as simple as taking some pepcid or even avoiding some types of foods altogether. I hope this helps and that you feel better soon.
ozexBuZ3aa	if your a girl it sounds to me like ovalation. speak to your mum about it, you may be starting your periods soon. try taking some pain killers to stop the pain and maybe book in to see a docter if your that worried x|`|RIhfYG0Saa	if your a girl, then you're growing, if you're a boy then idk?|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I would definetly talk to a doctor about that.

Maybe she can explain how this process will be of help to you so you can understand her reasoning.  Good Luck.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Tell her you're worried about the economy, the terrorists, the fungus on your big toe....

v4gUI96yaa	It could just be a yeast infection,but if your dr tells you that you have an std then you know for sure he is cheating....then you should move on nobody deserves to be with someone who is cheating AND has a bad temper to go along with it.You do have to tell him that you have an std(if you do) because he is going to need treatment as well.|`|TkJXWpFkaa	if it turns out you have caught an std from him walk (especially as hes violent) and dont go bck to him if a guy has cheated once how do you know hes not going to do it again|`|ipL31GYFaa	Yes you should because he could give it to some other girl and that is not good if you tell him he can preventt other people getting it. Since you arepositivee that he gave it to you then you should tell him so it will prevent someone else getting it.|`|CVKGpg3qaa	yes tell him so that they can have it cured and not spread it to others|`|X6zXjmUaaa	this dudes sounds crazy he could be going insane from syphilis better go get sum penicillin|`|satoCRC6aa	yep, your right, you know the answer to your delima, now you have the proof. confrontation is not alwayse the best way to handle it if he is violent.

Get rid of him and get healed and then put the whole sorry episode behind you.
kdSuwt8paa	The home pregnancy tests are very accurate if you do them properly so you may not be pregnant in spite of the symptoms, or you may be doing the tests too early.   As you said - you should go to the doctor, but time will tell anyway.|`|Aoa2fwQgaa	How exactly have you changed your diet? My sister's been going through something similar-her thyroid was a potential problem, she's got her cycle back but we're not sure exactly why it stopped for almost a year. Soy was another one of the things we'd checked out, she'd changed her diet and was eating A LOT of soy, which can be decremental to your health if you eat way too much. A cyst is possible as well, though it sounds like you're still having PMS symptoms. I'd say wait until this cycle passes-if pregnancy is a possibility then check for that after 4 weeks again, and then if you don't get your period after that (so if you miss your second cycle, which would be around a month and a half to two months), then I'd for sure set up an appt with a doc and get things checked out.  The fatigue and irritability are signs of a hormonal imbalance. Depression runs in my family and when my sister's hormones were out of wack with her period not coming, the depression kicked in, which caused her to be very irritable and tired, so if there's a history of depression in your family, that could be some depression showing up due to a hormonal imbalance. If you get an herb called "St. John's Wart" (or maybe it's "Wort", on "Wart", I don't remember), then that can help a lot with mild depression.
8cfyxToaaa	Loosing your virginity doesn't always hurt. Im not a virgin anymore, but i did use tampons when i was. They don't hurt if you insert them right, but i will admit its very awkward the first few times, taking them out is the worst (awkward wise). But its something you get use to over time. Don't worry just give it a try and if you don't like it stick with pads.|`|sHm4ISMJaa	are you asking if tampons hurt?  i am a virgin, and they feel weird at the beginning, but they definitely do not hurt, unless they are not in all the way.  but it definitely doesnt hurt like i would imagine losing your virginity would.  hope this helped!!!|`|P63t14eNaa	putting a tampon in doesnt hurt if u do it right|`|76usxNkvaa	uhh no i haven't and tampons don't hurt when that happens and the first time it sort of does but feels good :)|`|420e76e4daaff536c4d70d00660d1610aa	It doesn't hurt as long as you are relaxed and use plenty of lube.  It's only uncomfortable if you are dry down there or really tense.  Tampons don't hurt but again, you can put a dab of KY on the end just to help it in if need be. x|`|ulGgKEWSaa	everybody is different. It wont always hurt and tampons do not go high enough to hurt because sex only hurts when you break your hymen which will not happen by using a tampon.  xx|`|lsZDiqavaa	Your first time using a tampon will be a bit uncomfortable but loosing your virginity is a lot worst. I suggest saving your virginity till marriage anyway, At least till you find someone that you really care for & they feels the same way.

It's free.|`|WoqKWkQaaa	there seems to be more teens when it comes to cutting, but it's not ok to think about it.  you sound depressed.  you should talk to a councilor; they'll know what to do.  best wishes :)|`|AHuBqplbaa	You need to speak to somebody about this.  Do you really want advice on something so important coming from a bunch of bored strangers over the internet??    Tell your parents you wish to see a professional.  If you can't, than speak to a counsellor at school, or a teacher you can trust. I would not say thoughts like this are normal, but depending on your own experiences in life so far, they may not be abnormal either.  But you clearly could use some help, an ear to speak to at the very least.|`|XSTjyO1naa	Absolutely, its not normal to have suicidal thoughts most of the time. You are experiencing health problems, which turns you to act differently, your moods swings a lot. So at this time, if you are on medication, you must continue it and for further complexities, you must visit therapist or advice from Psychiatrist.  http://www.parentingteens.com/index/Trou...|`|2cDRRJ4laa	No this is not normal, but sometime i do feel suicidal myself. I have not talked to my supervisor on whats going on with me for me its depression Its not my fault i can't control it. Its more common in winter because of lack of sunlight. There were a couple of times where i thought bout killing myself. But i stopped and put myself in this situation. Imagine your already dead what would your parent or guardians think. how would your funeral be? Imagine your a spirit at your own funeral. I always think and put myself in these situations. It not fair.  I understand sometimes your brain sends off chemicals and its not your fault. I dont want help the medicine that physc doctors give can kill you. My advice is find friends or someone to talk to. It works for me. Even though i dont have friends i try and talk to someone it makes a difference trust me. If you want you can be my friend seriously. My point is this you not gonna make the pain go away it will only linger longer. Please don't do this to yourself.|`|rAawJuWcaa	well i mean i got those thoughts 2 but ive never cut my self like i mean it come and goes but like when i get like real pissed thats when those thoughts happen so im pretty sure they will go away if they dont then i think u should do wat those other people said|`|X0WBghTKaa	I Use To Have Thoughts Like That At About The Same Age   It Ended Up Being So Bad I Had To Tell My Mom An Had To See A Dr.  Its Better Now..

Hope i helped & Good luck |`|CLcGxHpAaa	No, suicidal thoughts are not normal for a teenager or anyone else.  These kind of thoughts may go away on there own, but it is not worth the risk.  You need to see a qualified physician for evaluation.  Suicidal thoughts are different from suicidal action, the fact that you cut, makes this situation all the more urgent. Please talk to your parents, a teacher or anyone that will assist you in seeing psychiatric help.|`|eDKSKqcSaa	It might be normal and it might go away. But your life is too precious to risk and you should find someone you can share your thoughts with. Suicidal thoughts can get out of control quite quickly. I'm 24 and work in mental health care now but when I was a teen I struggled with suicidal thoughts myself.  Find someone who will take it seriously and who cares.  Best of luck to you. TAKE CARE.|`|E1flIrdCaa	omfgggg im exactly the same and im 14...ive asked that question before....idk....im scared to IM me if u wanna talk its on my profile|`|AA11085654	You should see your doctor as soon as you can.  Suicidal thoughts are not normal. I had them really bad before I started taking my meds.   They start out as hating life and wishing to die, then they get stronger and eventually you will start to think that suicide is the best thing to do.  Dang, 15. You haven't even begun to live.  Please tell your parents or a school counselor or nurse that you think you have depression.|`|BPTfHiw5aa	same problem here. I think you should go to a therapist, before it gets worse. I know it will be hard but somehow you have to get through it.    Best of luck. also If you need to talk to me about anything just email me and I can help|`|cH1ztMjPaa	I don't think it's normal for a teenager.  It might go away.  It could go away and come back.  It doesn't mean you really want to kill yourself.  It means you feel hopeless, sad and maybe angry. Your parents are probably not capable of giving you the emotional support you need.  That sucks, but it would suck worse if you jumped in front of a truck.  It's not your fault that you don't have healthy parents.  Why should you pay with your life for a bad situation that you didn't cause and that you're stuck in?  That would be the ultimate unfairness.       You don't see a way out, and suicide is a way out.  Turning 18 is also a way out.  Start planning for that.  Get a job, babysit or something and save the money.  Do well enough in school to graduate so you can get a job when you're 18.  If you able to go to college, get a part-time job while you're there.       It's important to begin and maintain making some money, even a small amount.  You need to get it into your brain that you can make money, because remaining financially dependent on your parents as you get older will make you feel depressed and hopeless.       At 15 you're very close to independence.  Lots of 18 year olds at community college look for roommates to share housing with (if you're not going away to college.)  You can go look at the bulletin boards or websites of the colleges, you don't have to be a student.      When you're 15 if feels like you'll never be older.  18 seems decades away.  Make a list of the months until you turn 18 and cross them out as they go by.  Look at that a lot, the time will come.  Keep your eyes on the prize.
Yq2CUhtYaa	Well, for one, part of the cure is NOT asking for more advice. And asking for meds.    You're a hypochondriac. You're overreacting. If you understand this, then STOP over reacting, and STOP asking for help, because there's nothing actually wrong with you.    You don't need meds for something you're doing to yourself. You don't need people to tell you to chill out, if you already know that.    So, if you know this, put it into motion.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	The problem is, many people misunderstand Hypochondriasis and think it's as simple as saying, "look, there is nothing wrong with you, just tell yourself that and you'll be fine". If it was as simple no one would ever have a problem would they?    This is a form of anxiety, which manifests itself in many different ways. The answer is CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), it has a 70% success rate is curing your problem and it will- if you allow it to. Go and see your Dr and ask him to refer you. Medication is not the answer.     That said, in the UK there is a long waiting list for CBT, so in the meantime your GP can prescribe you with an SSRI which should help symptoms.|`|09009aa840b4de0060346d4327a1c0a9aa	That reminds of a joke I heard that goes along the lines of......a man goes to his Doctor's several times a week every week with every imaginable illness and disease.  He wakes up one morning with a splitting headache and decides that he MUST have a brain tumour and decides to back to his Doctor.  When he gets to the Doc's the Dr tells him "You have a typical case of hypochondria".  "Oh my word," says the man, "not that as well."
t5Mz1aLvaa	yes exercising and eating healty is also good... If you want you can stop eating junk food, but maybe every now and again you can give yourself a little treat or something.     If you do stuff with friends, that involves walking a lot or moving, like going to an amusement park, then that would be more fun then working on it alone... .|`|VB76LCmSaa	it depends on how much of a transition you made.  if you eat healthy with some junk on the side and you cut out the junk food you wouldn't loose a whole lot most likely.  so just go for it, its worth a shot and i'm sure if you put in some effort you'll be thin as wind and fine as wine in no time.    buon fortuna  ~bruno talina|`|0UBhxlkNaa	I never had to lose weight but I guarantee if you don't drink any soda then you will be healthier.  You might replace the calories by eating more food however.  Honestly you should just do all those things for your own health and forget the weight.  You don't have anything to worry about.  I gave up soda a long time ago and it was the best decision I ever made.  The stuff makes me sick now if I touch it.  It just shows you how dependent your brain is on junk that it would never really take normally.  Sorry if this isn't helpful to you.

Be careful, because it can be difficult to balance the bar while doing these.|`|b0faTDlJaa	gennerally u can put more emphasis on different parts of your pecs. Theres an upper and lower chest. Incline press stresses the upper, bench press both upper and lower, and dips and decline presses for the lower.The middle area which i think your talking about you can only cover by fat.Every1s mucles are different, theyll get bigger but is not likely to cover more space.

264GS7s7aa	I think they say that because there are germs in boogers, if you eat them it will build up your immune system.  If you do eat them, I guess in the long run you will get sick less often, making you healthy.|`|aqY13vWNaa	maybe, they are mostly water, but it still could have germs, so I'm guessing it's unhealthy.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Everybody eats them all of the time. Your sinus cavity is hooked to your throat. Every time you have a runny nose, your throat takes mucus, and transports it down into your stomach.|`|1oJtJCaWaa	Healthy or not... that is pretty gross!|`|m4q3hikbaa	Ew most definatly not, your boogers are dirt and little bugs.

224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Yeah, it depends on the chemo.    Adriamycin/Cytoxan made me lose virtually all my head hair, pubic hair, and leg hair. The rest hung on.    Then I started Taxol, and lost all the rest (arm, eyelashes, and eyebrows, face fuzz, etc.).    I suspect that if I had started Taxol first, I would have lost it all at that time.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	most body if not all,|`|5a5a5c0c2a0712dd2655d401a36b3686aa	All depends on the type of chemo, I was on short severe doses of drugs hence lost every hair on my body whereas others simply had thinning of head hair|`|FicyC2TXaa	It varies from person to person and from one chemo regime to another.    Not all types of chemo cause hair loss; some cause no hair loss at all and some just cause hair thinning. A person's oncologist will advise them in advance what the effect of their particular chemo is likely to be.    I lost the hair on my head and my pubic and underarm hair. I was lucky in that I didn't lose my eyebrows or eyelashes, although my eyebrows thinned a bit. Many people I know who had the same chemo I had lost their eyebrows and lashes. Almost nobody I know lost the hair on their legs - it's very stubborn.    I'm no fan of Jade Goody but she has had some dreadful criticism over her cancer, with people claiming she's using it for publicity etc. Some people forget she's the mother of small children and cancer and its treatment is as dreadful and grueling for her as for anyone else. I hope no rumours are going to start to the effect that she hasn't really had chemo as she hasn't lost her eyebrows...|`|AA12050428	I am sure it is all hair.....head and body. Maybe Jade Goody had false eyelashes.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	You lose it all, the eye brows and eye lashes seem to take longer, they thin slowly.  Chemo can not tell the difference between healthy and unhealthy cells, it attacks all cells in your body which is why you lose your hair.|`|LnL2T4oIaa	peoples bodies are all different, and how they react to meds will be different. i read about a case where somebody did not loose ANY hair. your friend is just... unlucky.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	sorry to hear about your friend hope she gets better soon....personally i never known any one to be in that situation..|`|LQABiZcaaa	It varies significantly from person to person, the dose,  and the different chemo drugs being used.   You might lose it all or there might be a thinning.   Courser hair like eye brows, lashes, pubic, etc. tend to thin and not lose all.|`|t27SvIPbaa	Chemotherapy is the biggest money making racket.  More people die of cancer when they take chemotherapy than those who do not.    Chemotherapy kills the Cancers cells TEMPORARY as it usually comes back within 5 years.  What it also does is kill your good cells that your immune system is weakened dramatically hence the loss of hair.  Chemotherapy has no scientific evidence that it cures cancer.|`|rP6CHrwgaa	Sorry to hear that Ariana, No girl I'd have no explanation.. :(|`|P544Sbmqaa	The first time I lost everything except my eye lashes.  The second time I lost the hair in my head, but not my eye brows/lashes.  I lost most of the hair on my arms and legs, but my pubic hair only thinned.    Really, it varies from person to person and from medication to medication.

FicyC2TXaa	There will be someone who is more than willing to sell them to you at a huge profit - sadly wherever there is cancer there is an unscrupulous charlatan eager to separate desperate people from their cash for useless 'cures' and this  is one such scam    It is one of the few 'alternative' therapies that has actually been tested; not only has it been shown to be ineffective against cancer, it's dangerous as it contains cyanide.    Please research thoroughly before you or anyone you know invests money, hope and - most dangerous of all for a cancer patient - time in ineffective and dangerous treatment.    Please be wary of unsubstantiated testimonials, especially on the inernet; you have no way of knowing if the person ever had cancer in the first place, much less that they were 'cured'.    Read this article for the facts about this particular scam:    http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRela...|`|8UQ7GupHaa	http://www.cancerchoices.com/Merchant2/m...|`|bYjercAqaa	In raw apricots|`|AA12212523	Save your money, it's a scam.|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	Be very careful about treating yourself with an unproven remedy for something you may not have!    Apricot kernels contain cyanide!!!    You could kill yourself with cyanide poisoning.    There is no documented, scientific proof that these help anyone.    People like yourself take them because they "think" they have caner, then get tested years later and when there is no evidence of cancer claim they have been "cured".    See a Dr and get and accurate diagnosis before deciding on either conventional or quack treatments.
al0cCPb6aa	I have been doing the same thing! I wanted to do things on my own. Whenever I do a fad diet...weight watchers...ediets...whatever you keep paying and paying and as soon as you go off of it you gain the weight back. I finally had enough and decided to do things on my own terms.    I eat candy occaionally and I mean really rare and if I do I have like one tiny piece I don't over indulge just have a taste of it. As for soda, I haven't drank it in a month and I tried some the other day just a sip and I was like WHOA way too sweet. I've just been drinking tea with splenda and water so now most things are too sweet for me, which is really awesome!      Yeah I quit fast food too...I was eating a lot of empty calories as well. I've lost 16 pounds so far and hopefully alot more to come! I excersise every single freaking day too. There are days where I really don't feel like it, but I force myself too. I dont' want to slack at all.      Gratz to you though! Glad I'm not the only one who cut out so much stuff. Everyone is like if you do that you'll binge. I just tell them I have self control, if you don't that's your thing. Don't tell me I can't do something when I'm doing it hehe.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	WOW, that is just awesome!

vgWUdKCOaa	if cayenne pepper is an herb -- this can.  I'm not sure if it's a true hot flash, but ingesting it (in a drink, for instance), can certainly cause you to flush for a minute or so.|`|yE2vM76naa	Niacin most certainly causes a flush for most folks.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	If the supplements effect your hormones, they can.   Some herbs effect one or another hormone.  The hormone system is a communication network that works back and forth.  If one is unbalanced it can unbalance another.    So, if it effects your adrenals, or ovaries, you might get an unbalance that can cause hot flashes.

I agree with the Answerer above, you should try to swish salt water around in hopes it will dislodge it.  If nothing else, the salt will rid your mouth of any other irritant and hopefully give you some relief.      You probably won't have to have your tooth PULLED if there's nothing wrong with it; you just need to get the irritant out from between your gum and your tooth.  Try to see if chewing gum will help, perhaps you just need something that will fit between the gum and tooth, which gum seems to do.      I have had this happen before, and even though I had the tooth treated, I am very careful if I have pork, especially, since it seems to cause a worse reaction than beef.|`|ipL31GYFaa	When that happed to me I was told to take salt water and swish it around to get all the food that got stuck in my gums and in my teeth and It worked.

dwLqreuvaa	It doesnt matter whether it is child abuse but it is abuse and your brother would certainly get punished from this,     Talk to a trusted adult with this, its a very serious issue|`|AgqIXOasaa	Yes it does. If you get hurt and it leaves marks then its counted as child abuse. You need to tell somebody. If you dont want to tell somebody personally you can call childline on 0800 11 11. Or you could email samaritans at jo@samaritans.org. But you must tell somebody so it can stop. It's best to get help with somebody you know in person though, and they can get hold of the police, because even if he is your brother, it is still child abuse.    Hope i helped :) xx|`|oq29JFRfaa	yeaa. i think so|`|kdSuwt8paa	Yes.    If he is deliberately hitting you that is abuse.    If it is in play he shouldn't play so rough.    Avoid physical contact with him.  From any angle this sounds bad.|`|Hacoibteaa	You should compose a piano concerto and close out the movie by playing it.|`|10zaYXqGaa	yeah it does. But brothers are supposed to "fight" each other.come on, don't be a brat, and hit him back. It's just playing.|`|AA10725587	Or you could quit being a whiny kid and deal with it.  No wonder you get smacked around.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It is a Schedule 18 offence under the Law.  I used to work in partnership with the Probation Service.  The fact that he is your brother doesn't change the Law.|`|gpO5thmSaa	Yeah, he's older than 18 and you're a minor.|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Yes it does...you need to report it if you have evidence of the bruising...and also to the person who said stop being a whiney kid...you obviously have no respect for anyone and your as bad as the answerers 19 year old brother! If you cant give sensible answers please go away|`|WhzOlOiEaa	Legally yes.  It is a offence of child cruelty if a person 16 plus does a number of different things to a person under 16.    Separate from child abuse it would be assault anyway.    I have to say practically though, is this family play fights or really violence?|`|QAM3gVs6aa	It does since he is legally an adult (18), try telling your parents or any other guardian that you live with. If your on your own and your brother is constantly hurting you in this way and wont stop, tell someone like a close relative and seek guidance. If you choose not to go to a relative you can always talk to a school teacher. They will listen to you as a part of their job. And if you really wish they can even send over a social worker to help out and intervene in matters. I hope that helps you|`|nikli8fyaa	Yes, and if this is not the first time it has happened, tell your mom and call the police. I know he is your bro, but seriously, it stops being a family issue when your safety is on the line. Trust me on this, don't wait, my bro would hit me and my little bro too!!! We didn't call the police, but I wish we had, because now he is out of control and ruining my entire families lives!!! I am not exaggerating.|`|YvqiIkZCaa	Any adult hitting on a minor is considered physical abuse. A lot of offenses can be seen with it, like physical harassment resulting in injury and others.    If you are being hit by a brother (not while you are playing around) but he is hitting you because he wants to show who is boss, then it is definitely abuse. Please contact the authorities if it happens immediately. Seek medical consult to get the necessary evidence as well.    Domestic violence must not be tolerated. Please take care.|`|KdNZGP8Baa	yes|`|tpSZA4xJaa	i don't think it does because hes you brother but if u really cant stand it then you should tell your parent first and then they'll guide you to do the right thing|`|smGTHpTmaa	yes it is. he is considered an adult and you are a minor its doesn't matter if he is your brother or not it is child abuse.|`|xvh3OdKDaa	idk but if it does almost all of the U.S.A's kids'  and beyond are gonna be charged if that is child abuse. I dont think it is though. i hope so, so i can siew my evil brother!!|`|MrPwK9s7aa	Your brothers. Thats what you do.|`|Ifo0kf5yaa	technically yes he is because He's over 18 and your under. isn't there a reason as to why he s hitting you or what you did to get hi to hit you. other wise tell an adult and keep out of his way
Px8urrAuaa	Stress can certainly change your period, so that could be the problem.    As for the smell, I'm really not sure what that could be.  You might have an infection.    Go to the doctor ASAP, honey.    Good-Luck!    Everyone has a smell down there, but if it smells "fishy," That isn't good. Get it checked out.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	Please go to the doctor.
ccdc6f3f519842053378bde625158b4aaa	i lost 20 pounds. it was easy for me. all i did was drink a lot of water and danced to my favorite music in my room until i was tired. And the only changes that i did was eat smaller portions. SIMPLE eh ?!|`|2q1XI0j9aa	you can definitely do this, but i think you need to talk with your parents and express you feel over wight and want to get healthy, they can help and support you    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|0muvYszmaa	just walk 1-2 hours a day it will work trust me + eat healthy  thank you for your time|`|m4q3hikbaa	Exercise for 30 minutes daily, eat fruits and vegatables, drink lots and lots of water, maybe go jogging around your block twice a week, go to the community center and exercise, pretty much just get active!|`|wpkJFL5Qaa	eat less, one secret taht models have is eat ice cubes, & also drink 4 bottles or even 6 of water, so you keep full with that , & don't even touch sugar, than watch by summer time you'll loes even more than 20 pounds|`|dlgQCSocaa	How tall are you and what is your current weight?  A healthy weight loss range is 1-2lbs a week.  Start by eating healthy (5 - 6 small meals a day), and engage in regular physical activity. Eat whole grains, foods high in fiber, fruits and veggies, yogurt, milk, low-fat, low-sugar, etc. Have your Mom or Dad join you/support with the healthy eating, by them doing it themselves.  Try activities like swimming, biking, skiing, walking, dancing, kickboxing, etc. to make physical activity more interactive and fun.  Do these activities with a friend so its a social thing.  30 - 60 minutes of aerobic exercise 3 - 5 times a week is optimal.  Good luck.|`|2facaa92a7738bf74922d878ba7e3647aa	Almost everyone knows that loosing weight is about changing your eating habits to a considerable extent. What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.    Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-crital even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty.     You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals! Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike! Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!     If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!|`|iQJuEtH2aa	Read this book ...

There are so many good things about it. I literally force myself to drink 10 glasses a day. If you drink a glass of water before each meal you'll eat less & feel full more quickly. Drinking ice cold water actually helps your body burn more calories since it has to work harder to get it up to your body's temp. If I keep eating fairly healthy & exercising a least a little every day, it helps me lose weight so start with that :)|`|ipL31GYFaa	Try walking for about 30 min a day and eat small porions of food and stop eating by 8:00 at night you should lose weight there|`|duyN8ahBaa	balanced diet   work out regularly  Pills if wanna loss fast .

ZrwaXUUzaa	yes it's normal. Plan B is an Increased amount of hormones from your normal birth control pill. and when you take that dosage away that will kick your body into jump starting your menses cycle.<br>  <br>  No this does not mean you are pregnant. Plan B jump starts your cycle and doesn't let a fertilized egg  attach to the uterine wall because the environment isn't ideal (hormone levels) for implantation.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you start taking the pill so you can have double coverage.<br>  (if you take plan B enough times your cycle will be really screwed up)
