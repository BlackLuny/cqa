20071018090958AAWcLKR	Science & Mathematics;Biology	A che punto è la ricerca di Graig Venter sul cromosoma artificiale?	Ciao a tutti. A scuola ci hanno lasciato da fare delle ricerche sulle biotecnologie e io ho pensato di parlare del cromosoma artificiale sintetizzato da Venter. Per trattare l'argomento mi sto servendo di alcuni articoli di giornale pubblicati domenica 7 ottobre.    Ora, qualcuno di voi saprebbe dirmi se dal 7 ottobre sino ad oggi sono stati compiuti passi avanti? Se le ricerche e gli esperimenti sono andati avanti? Se il mycoplasma laboratorium (il cromosoma sintetico) è stato iniettato nella cellula per verificarne le capacità? Insomma... vi sono aggiornamenti rispetto a 10 giorni fa?      Grazie

20090204215158AAbnzfr	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Number of alien worlds quantified?	Intelligent civilisations are out there and there could be thousands of them, according to an Edinburgh scientist.       The discovery of more than 330 planets outside our solar system in recent years has helped refine the number of life forms that are likely to exist.       The current research estimates that there are at least 361 intelligent civilisations in our Galaxy and possibly as many as 38,000.       The work is reported in the International Journal of Astrobiology.       Even with the higher of the two estimates, however, it is not very likely that contact could be established with alien worlds.       While researchers often come up with overall estimates of the likelihood of intelligent life in the universe, it is a process fraught with guesswork; recent guesses put the number anywhere between a million and less than one.       "It's a process of quantifying our ignorance," said Duncan Forgan, the University of Edinburgh researcher who carried out the work.       In his new approach, Mr Forgan simulated a galaxy much like our own, allowing it to develop solar systems based on what is now known from the existence of so-called exoplanets in our galactic neighbourhood.       These simulated alien worlds were then subjected to a number of different scenarios.   If alien life forms do exist, we may not necessarily be able to make contact with them, and we have no idea what form they would take       Duncan Forgan   Edinburgh University       The first assumed that it is difficult for life to be formed but easy for it to evolve, and suggested there were 361 intelligent civilisations in the galaxy.       A second scenario assumed life was easily formed but struggled to develop intelligence. Under these conditions, 31,513 other forms of life were estimated to exist.       The final scenario examined the possibility that life could be passed from one planet to another during asteroid collisions - a popular theory for how life arose here on Earth.       That approach gave a result of some 37,964 intelligent civilisations in existence.       Form and function       While far-flung planets may reduce uncertainty in how many Earth-like planets there are, some variables in the estimate will remain guesses.       For example, the time from a planet's formation to the first sparks of life, or from there to the first intelligent civilisations, are large variables in the overall estimate.       For those, Mr Forgan says, we will have to continue to assume Earth is an average case.       "It is important to realise that the picture we've built up is still incomplete," said Mr Forgan.       "Even if alien life forms do exist, we may not necessarily be able to make contact with them, and we have no idea what form they would take.       "Life on other planets may be as varied as life on Earth and we cannot predict what intelligent life on other planets would look like or how they might behave."       Whats your thoughts?

20090205010948AAnUrsJ	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Can you teach me how to do this math question? Please...?	Okey... $720,000; or for simplicity let's go with $60,000 which will work just as well. Hopefully I didn't confuse you yet.. That's 720k / 12.   Now, that's 25% of a total, so we have either $240,000, or $2,880,000 let's go with the full one as that's what I'm looking for and saves me a step of multiplying your answer by 12. Right now we have $2,880,000 as our number, but some how we need to figure that there was   an additional 8% on top of that.   Let's see.. trying a few numbers and then multiplying them by .   92, it appears that our original figure would be near $3,140,000   BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF IT, either...   Now we have to divide that number by   $29.95, and we have approximately 104,841.   075 x $29.95 (7.5%) = $2.25 + $1 = $3.25   x 104,841 = approx $340,733   + $3,140,000 = $3,480,733      That being said, if you can teach me the   part where I had to guess numbers to   figure out "how to add 8%" that'd be great   PS: Essentially what you're doing is, you own a website and are receiving $60k cash per month. Now you're trying to figure out the total   worth of that business. It's a $29.95 product,   with a $1 + 7.5% payment processing fee.It carries a 8% refund rate due to the market, and you pay affiliates 75% commission per   sale.(yes not all sales are from affiliates so that throws off our figures, but it's close enough. UNLESS you want to send me the   equation for figuring out the annual gross where I can plug in if non-affiliate sales were.

Hello Everyone,   I would like to calculate the length of steel sheet (approx. 0.2 mm thick and 8 mm width) wound on a reel of 8 mm wide and 200 mm diameter. The outer diameter of the ring after the sheet being wound is 5000 mm. (Clarification: The sheet is wound over the previous winding everytime, as the width of the inner ring is equal to the width of the sheet, unlike a cable wound in a hub where the width of the hub is relatively many a times larger than the diameter of a cable and the cable being wound beside and over the previous winding).      Please propose a mathematical formula for the above problem.   Thank you very much,      Venkat

20090205030034AA3Ixte	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	What could make my rings change colour?	I have two rings that mysteriously change colours sometimes. One of them is sterling silver and the other is white gold. Both are worn on the index finger of each hand.       Sometimes when I wake up or while I am in the shower, I notice that the rings have changed from their usual silver colour to a gradient between bronze, metalic blue, purple, and black. After a while, the problem usually corrects itself and the rings return to their normal shades.       I wear two other rings of the same metals which are not affected by this at all. It seems to only happen to the two on my index fingers. I know that they are real sterling silver and white gold because they were both purchased from very reputable jewelery stores. At no time does either colour change affect the colour of my fingers underneath.      What is making this happen? Is this typical tarnishing? Is it normal? Why does this occur?

At the boot of our car we beheld a three toed footprint about one third of a foot long, with three toes about two centimeters apart from each other with one two centimeters in front of the other two, they were all arranged in a kind of arc. about a third of a foot back there was another mark. All these marks were circular in shape. The footprints continued at about half a meter intervals and then stopped when the snow ran out. Does anyone know what this could be apart from a dinosaur?
