20080403184724AAvc76U	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Can you break the hood by closing it too hard?	I drive a g35 coupe and recently got a new grill for it, i think the grill is a little thicker than the stock grill, so the hood doesn't close as easily. Before i was able to snap it shut after it catches on the first latch, but now i have to raise it up and use the weight of the hood to properly close it. So my question is, will the hood be damaged? or are they designed to do so?

20090205013203AAXDttm	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Thinking about learning how to drive a manual?	So I'm a licensed driver who hasn't touched a car for awhile. (Ok, so my parents are a little scared of me running into something w/o insurance--which they aren't willing to share--and insurance are costly to a college student!)  I've been raised on how to drive on automatics and as early as three years ago during one summer, I've actually first paid attention to the stick shift when a friend and I were driving to Lake Tahoe.  I was intrigued at how she was able to do such maneuvers and know which gears to use.        Just a few hours ago, a friend and I were just biking home together and he mentioned something about cars and the driver's guide, which led me to believe that he must've recently started to obtain a license.  (I knew for a fact that he hasn't gotten his yet even though he is older than me and I believe both his two younger brothers have licenses, but of course not having yet obtained a license isn't an age factor.)   So, I asked and sure enough he's trying to obtain some practice!  With this, he bought up the topic about manuals, which resurfaced my curiosity about them, as it had been buried and forgotten because of other problems caused by life.  Since I've been a cyclist for a few years now, I've understood a bit at how gears work.  Cars?  Eh, not so much, unless much of it is pretty much applied similarly (it would be nice if someone here could clarify).  How difficult is it to transition from being an automatic user to a manual user?  Will it be easy to learn on your own?  Or will it be easier to learn from an instructor?  (Now that is an excuse I will be willing to make an appointment for, if I need to do so.)      I'll appreciate for your answers!  Your answer can be as long as you want, but it needs to be at least two to three sentences at minimum!  It's not exactly a question that can be easily answered with just one sentence.  Thanks for taking your time to read this!

I have an 03 VW GTI, shortly after i bought the car it stared to Click, Pop, and whine. i bought the car completely stock, The noise was there with the stock stereo, speakers, everything. i put my kenwood HU in it thinking that i should fix my problem, NO. did nothing. the static has just gotten worse over time becoming VERY BAD! iv had this car for alittle over a year, thats how long iv dealt with the noise. the static will switch from speaker to speaker sometimes alot then at the same time. iv also put in my two JL 10s with kicker 500W amp not much but its all i need. iv checked all my connections, wires, ground, power, everything. the problem in my car was there with stock components, so not something iv done, i think. i know cars and car audio quite well, im not a pro or anything but i no what im doing. one other think i should mention is that if i lightly hit the either side of my dashboard (around the stereo) sometimes it quits and just has a high pitched whine that i can flood out with a little music, but anymore my little hit fix doesn't work, i know the whine could be my alternator. it doesn't mater if  the volume is up or down, it does it the worst when the motor is running but still does the high pitched whine when off.   anybody got any ideas   thanks

But I recently bought an AC/DC inverter to charge my laptop on the road.     I was wondering if using it causes the engine to use extra gas to recharge the battery, or extra wear on the alternator or something.    Is this just free energy for the taking or am I paying for it in another way? Can I use my AC/DC inverter with impunity?

Ok I have an 02 F250 Super Duty and I am having 4 wheel drive problems, am going to list everything that has happened so I can hopefully get help with this.   1. About 3 weeks ago I had to use the 4 wheel drive one morning and it worked fine, just as it always had before that. A couple of hours later I needed it again and it didn't lock in, unnoticed until I was stuck in the mud.   2. I lock in the hubs and turn the switch, I can hear the solenoid/acuator shifting but still have no power to the front wheels.   3. I have heard a slight grinding noise in the front left hub area a couple of times before that but it always quit before I could get pulled over to try to find the source of it.   4. I read that the vacuum pump could cause this and my heater only works on defrost, which kind of points that way but why would I still be able to hear the solenoid/acuator if this was my problem?   5. If I just unhook the vacuum and change to better quality lockin hubs how would I change from 4 hi to 4 low? Would the switch on the dash still work that part even though I have unhooked the vacuum to the front hubs?   Please help can provide any more info needed, Thanks

20090204220157AAxaL2i	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	1995 Suzuki Katana Carburetor flange/venturi stuck open?	Ok, so I just rebuilt and reinstalled the carb, air box, and gas tank onto my bike.  It starts up and runs fine, idles fine, rev's fine, but here is the dilemma.  The idle is tuned to 1500 rpms, and when you pull on the throttle, it will rev fine, to 5, 6, or whatever rpm you pull to, but when the rpms go down again, it won't descend lower than 3000 or so.  So, with the tank raised and slightly to the side, I pushed on the flange to close the venturis.  They will close manually and stay at the desired idle setting, but it won't return to idle on it's own.  The choke is closed.  The throttle cable is not sticking.  It just won't descend below 3000 rpms on its own.  Any advice on why it is sticking?   Cheers~   PS: Also, I tried with the air filter on and with it off to make sure that air flow was not an issue.  All adjustments have been attempted for the idle, and the throttle (both at the carb and at the handle).

20090204222718AAUhb3i	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Please solve overheating problem (honda civic)?	I drive a 2002 honda civic si-coup.  When I drive long distances (20-30 KM) and then hit a sudden stop (brake) The thermostat on my car starts to rise, sometimes almost going to H. The temperature increase is sudden, as soon as I stop, after driving long distances , it begins to rise, it takes less than a minute to get one click away from H.     When this happens the heater stops working and begins to  blow freezing cold air. (which makes no sense because the thermostat says its overheating).However there is no visible steam comming out of my car.    I've gotten it checked out at my local mechanic and he doesnt know what the problem is, because he can't get it to overheat in the shop, since I have to drive long distances for it to overheat. He has checked the cooling system entirely and everything is working as it should be, there aren't any leaks in any hoses, everything is working just fine.    When my car does this, and I take it into the shop they fill it up with coolant and i'm "fine" for a couple weeks or so. However, this doesn't really make sense, because the coolant shouldn't be dissapearing...if its not leaking out of a hose or something, right?     Please help me figure out what is wrong with my car.Why is it overheating?

20090204223056AAQM3oC	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	R6 Problem - Held Back/Hesitation When Giving It Full Throttle? Any Info?	Was riding it around and I gave it all it had. At that time, it held back some and kind of stumpled to go again until I backed off the throttle and normally increased the speed. Then, I tried again because it never has given me a problem. I gave it all it had three more times and it ran fine and fast for those times. Just that first time was the problem.      This is not a track bike... take good care of it and it runs perfectly. Use it just as a daily riding bike to work, school and wherever else I may need to go. Took it to the track once and best I did was high 11s but only once.      But riding it easily and doing what I always do (try to not do anything over 7K RPM), it can't ride any better that what it does. I was just wondering if anyone has info on why it did that when I gave it full throttle?      Thanks. 2004 Yamaha R6. 20K Miles

Hey guys,      My car is making a weird sound in first-fourth gears.  It's almost mower like to describe i guess... Anyway, most of the time it doesn't make the sound in first. When it makes it in 2nd, it initially sounds normal, but as the revs rise, the sound begins to start - same with 3rd and 4th gear. It never makes the sound in 5th gear (as of yet).  The car feels as if its running perfectly fine. Only current issue is the high-pressure power steering hose. Seriously doubt that this could be linked in any way (but weirder things have happened).   It's definitely not any weird sound coming from a flat tire or anything of that nature (got them changed today, sound was there before and after the change).  So yea... please make some suggestions!

20090204230643AAOsXCc	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is my tranny working properly?	I had my tranny serviced last Thursday. The fluid was replaced (they used universal automatic tranny fluid), put in a new filter and checked the pan gasket. They also replaced a ruptured line from the tranny with a new one. That stopped the fluid from leaking. They did not find any debris or shavings in the filer or fluid, but before the change, the fluid was kind of dirty. The car does not jerk when it shifts, but are you supposed to feel it shift? I can feel the car change gears, usually at 2nd. For some reason, the car used to shift into overdrive at 40 mph, but now it shifts into overdrive at 50 mph. Solenoid problem? The Check Engine light has not come on at all, so there may not be a problem. Is it "Game Over"?       This is a 95 Buick Regal GS 3800 (13 years running)

20090204232139AA5VFcc	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Plugs keep fouling on passenger side motor 2003 yukon 5.3 flex fuel?	I was trying to figure out why my truck was making a squealing nose. I put a new belt tensioner on. It still squeeled. I realized the alternator was making the noise to. I took the alternator apart and realized the brushes were bad. I rebuilt that in 20 min. I cleaned my throttle body with cleaner. I started the truck and it was idling funny so I cleaned it again. The problem stopped. A week and a half later the truck started to misfire. I took the plugs out and they were all dry carbon black at the tips on the passenger side only. so I put new plugs and wires in. The next day same thing (misfire). I noticed only the passenger side keeps fouling out. I cleaned the plugs and put them back in. A GM tech told me my catalytic convertor was clogged on passenger side so I replaced passenger side cat. The cat. was like a chunk of charcoal. The drivers side catalytic con. was perfect as well as the plugs. My plugs keep fouling up on the passenger side. I took a can of seafoam and sucked up almost a half can to clean out the intake ( 2 master mechanics told me to try that. The tips are dry black and the threads of the spark plugs are a little wet black.I have changed these plugs everyday for 3 days since I changed cat. Convertor. I did a compression check it was 120 (normal). I did a fuel pressure check (normal). The truck has a misfire when idling or sowing down to stop. The check engine light stays on. I can drive at a steady pace or faster and it seems fine. The check engine light starts blinking. Im usually good at figuring thngs out but I cant figure this out. What should I do first before I assume the worst and spend alot of money playing guessing games. Please any opinions I would be glade to hear

Ma mate has got a kenwood headunit connected to a bose (i tink dats it) amp powering a single kenwwod 12" sub. the sub keeps cutting in and out, so like hel b playin music n itl jst randomly stop or start up. I have a general idea what im doing, bt im no expert. Im goin to hav a good look at it 2morro bt id appreciate some feedback as to what 2 look 4.   The amp dsnt cut off, the light stays green jst the sub stops producing any sound.   I am going to check the grounding wire, the battery wire and behind the headunit for loose wires but apart from that im not sure what to look for cus i doubt they r the culprits due to the amps continous working. The amp also has cooling fan so it cant b overheating or anything.   The sub works fine when connected to my system   also the amp is mounted on enclousure so is it possible this has screwed the amp into not always passing along the signal to the amp?   any help as to what to look for would b appreciated thank you

Hey guys      The high pressure power steering hose on my car has a tiny split.  This is causing a decent amount of leakage.  Any ideas on how to fix this leakage? Cloth tape doesn't work (heat causes the adhesive to to melt - useless).  Any ideas would be appreciated.  Hose costs $490AUD plus approx. $50AUD labour.  I'm a uni student with very little cash (had to replace tires - $430) so i'm trying to prolong the lifetime of the hose so i have time to raise the funds.  Please don't say "you can't fix it, you have to buy a new one". Please don't bother answering if that is the case (sorry to be so up front about it).      Thanks

I have a 1997 dodge avenger and the brakes were done march 2008 (new pads/rotors). In sept 08 it started making a weird creaking/crunching-type noise from front brake-area when stopping, at slow speeds only (like stopping at a stop sign  10 degrees celsius. The noise is ONLY when the brake pedal is applied and the noise stops if I release the pedal. I have taken it back to the place that did the brakes over 5 times and they keep saying "everything is safe, nothing is loose, the brakes are like new" and I have also taken it to two other places and was told the brakes are fine. I am beginning to get very frustrated as the noise is extremely annoying and pedestrians look at my car like 'WTF is that'. ANY help or similar experiences is appreciated.

20090204230114AAVTv4X	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Railroad crossing and Stop sign dilemma!?	Near my home there are two streets that run parallel to and on both sides of a railroad track. The track has two intersections where there is a stop sign after you go over the track. The problem is that if you stop for the stop sign at the second intersection, then the back of your vehicle is still on the track! If you stop before the track then you are in the middle of the first intersection! I would love to find out if I should illegally stop on the railroad track or illegally run the stop sign or illegally stop before the track in the middle of the intersection then go over the track and illegally run the stop sign since there is not enough room between the track and the stop sign? Please tell me this is not a "common sense vs. the law" since I don't want to break the law nor do I want to be stupid!

The light has been on for a  year or two, but I'm getting ready to sell the van and I want to get the light to go off.

Anyone have any advice as to how to keep it from freezing...or how to get it to thaw quicker.  Or how to even tell if its froze or if its dead...It wasnt acting funny when I turned it off last time I drove it..(Tuesday morning)  However it has been acting funny anyways for awhile, when idling it acts like it wants to die, has a miss to it.  My brother thinks its a vaccum leak and even got it to stop doing it as bad but couldnt find the leak.
