pZGLhV2Waa	If I were choosing between the two that you have listed the 17-55 F2.8 would be my choice. The F2.8 constant aperture would be the main reason. This lens will perform very well in low light situations. It is two stops faster at 55mm than the other lens. It is also optically superior. Cost wise though this go over your budget. The lens costs about $1,000    Now as to whether you will appreciate it. This depends on your skills and how often you will need the F2.8 aperture. If your camera never leaves the auto or scene modes you probably wont appreciate it. If you do have a basic understanding of exposure and use either manual or aperture priority you will probably enjoy the lens.     It would be a good choice for portraits and general photography. For the cost though you have some other choices that are pretty close in price. The downside I see with this lens is that it is an EFs lens. If you ever upgrade to a full frame body like the 5D it wont work. Now you might say that you wont but technology advances quickly. In a few years you might find that full frame cameras are much cheaper and more common than they are now.    For the same cost you can get the Canon EF 17-40 F4L $699 and the 50mm F1.8. The 17-40 is a premium wide angle zoom lens. The 50mm F1.8 often called the nifty fifty is a great portrait lens. It is very sharp and fast. It will give great Bokeh for your portraits and the best part is it cost $100. These two lenses will cover basically the same range as the 17-55mm and will both work on full frame cameras.    Other lenses to consider would be the EF 24-105 F4L $1,059 or the 24-70 F2.8L $1,250 both are a little bit more than the 17-55 F2.8 $1,000. You would lose out a little on the wide end but gain some on the tele end. Both are professional lenses.    Another cheaper alternative would be the EF 28-135mm. Again you lose out on the wide angle but you gain quite a bit on the telephoto end. Cost about $400      Another option would be the Canon EFs 18-200mm. This is a great all around lens. The focal length range will cover most every situation. For many people this is the only lens they will ever need. It is not as fast and sharp as the 17-55 F2.8 but it is very versatile. Cost $595|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM is NO better than your current kit lens, so it would really be a big mistake to buy it.     The EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM on the other hand is a fine lens. It's a great lens especially or indoor/low light shooting, but it's WAY over-priced. It also has a 77mm filter thread, so buying filters, especially a Cir. Polarizer, won't come cheap. But, if you can justify the cost (approx. US$1030), then it's well worth looking at.    I own the Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and it's a very good lens, but the one thing I wish it had though, was IS.     A few alternatives are...  the excellent EF 70-200mm lenses which are available in f/2.8 IS, f/2.8, f/4 IS and f/4 versions. The f/2.8 IS version is best, but it doesn't come cheap. In your price range, I recommend the f/4 version (it's only around US$600). This is a very highly rated lens, they all are...so maybe have a look at them.     The EF17-40 f/4 L USM (Canon's lightest L lens) is another quality choice (US$649). But, it's focal length might be too limited for your needs.    Also, have you considered a prime lens? These focus fast and have very sharp image quality (better than many zoom lenses). They're great for portraits and low light.  Some good choices...  EF50mm f/1.8 (ultra cheap & budget, very sharp image quality and a bargain at less than US$90).  Or if you want better quality (especially in build and USM), then look at the EF50mm f/1.4  Or, the EF85mm f/1.8. I have this lens and it's a great lens (with nice bokeh).  etc. etc.    The EF-S 55-250mm rates reasonably, but it's not what you would call a great lens. It's really a budget lens so image quality could be a lot better.    The new EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM is a better choice (and what a great focal range). It only costs US$595 (from Amazon), but, I still have reservations regarding it's IQ (from reading several lens reviews).    Check out the lens reviews below...  good luck
uDK0gBwoaa	Just hook up your VCR/DVD to your VHS machine and play the Tape on the VCR/DVD and press record on the other one and it's like recording off of tv.
cTo5zrF7aa	this is a pretty general question, considering there are a ton.  i can give you a few.    panning- swinging the camera left to right or vice versa  dollying- the camera moves alongside the shot following the image  Stabilized shot- camera is on a tripod and does not move to follow the image  Long Shot- a large scene, big picture  Medium Shot- usually about as much as a person from the waist up  Tight Shot- usually as big as a hand, or a person's face  Extreme Tight Shot- A finger, a nose, an eye, etc.
AA10326440	You said that you and your friend both have unlimited texting but she can only text Verizon people.  If that is the case she does not have unlimited texting, she has unlimited "IN" texting which would mean she can only text Verizon customers.  But she can get unlimited texting to use to anyone on any network for $20 on an individual plan or $30 for a family share (the $30 gives everyone on the family share plan unlimited texting).    Verizon is now advertising that Alltel is apart of Verizon so I would think that you should be able to text eachother but to make sure I would call the customer service department of Verizon & Alltel just to make sure.|`|26zfOKYNaa	Some alltel customera are already in the verizon network but all may not be until the transiton is complete.  Go to verizonwireless.com and type in calling in the search box.  It lets u put in 3 numbers at a time n it will tell u if they are in or out of the network.  If in and u have plans w unlimited in then ure ok.|`|VFOyzZJIaa	Otherway around. Alltel is part of Verizon, and Unlimited Texting, no matter who to, is always free on your part. If SHE doesn't have the Unlimited Texting she's probably going to get charged 10-15 cents a message.

Now, make sure you are connected to the Video 1 input on your TV set, and you are connected to the VIDEO OUT on your DVD player...    Hit the source button and enjoy....|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Just something to add here.    Using composite cables is not only going to get you the worst pic quality, but it won't carry a proper widescreen signal. You'll either have a totally letter boxed pic with widescreen movies (bars top/bottom and left/right) or a distorted and stretched picture (to fill the screen) why would you pay so much for a new HDTV, and then do this?    If your DVD player has HDMI use it, the next best is component (three red, blue, green for pic, two for sound).
pWnvpLyCaa	I took a quick look at the Navigon 2100 and it seems unsuitable for geocaching.  As for charging, since it apparently pulls its power from a mini USB connector, it might be possible to charge it from your home computer (I have a hand held GPS that works that way).  I didn't have the full manual so I don't know the exact process for adding a waypoint, but typically if you set a waypoint, you can then edit the coordinates to your desired value.  As you might guess, that process will become a nuisance in short order.  For comparison, I can upload 1000 geocache waypoints to either of my caching GPS units in seconds.  The display does not appear to be very adaptable to caching, either.    Add all that to what the previous poster has said, and you will see that your best be is probably to use your Navigon to travel to the cache, and then switch to a hand held unit for the hunt.  The Garmin 60CSx was mentioned, and it is my favorite, but you can begin caching with less expensive units and then work up if price is an issue.|`|AA10277440	An automotive GPS receiver is a really poor choice for geocaching.  While good for getting you to the parking lot for the cache, they are not good for using on the trail.  They are more difficult to hold, do not have good battery life, are not water resistant, and cannot withstand drops as well as a handheld unit.  Not to mention the problem you encountered of not being able to easily enter latitude and longitude directly.    I suggest you either relegate your Navigon to in-car use only or replace it with a handheld GPS receiver like a Garmin GPSmap 60Cx or a Garmin eTrex Legend HCx.

So you can see your bill on paper.  Now the options you have to pay your bill are: you can request an address change to get your bill and get it mailed to you.  You can pay by debit card or credit card on the phone by again dialing 611 or you can go inside a tmobile store and pay cash or by card.   You can register your phone online at tmobile.com and pay your bill there. Lastly you can go into a tmobile store and buy a tmobile prepaid card scratch off the gray area in the back and tell the tmobile representative the pin number. I hope this works|`|e4QW4xvOaa	You can always go onto their website and view your bill online. You will have to register it and then you can access it. I believe they send a text message to your phone when you try to sign up though, at least that is what AT&T does. Once you've done that, you can pay your bill online and edit all your billing information. Hope I helped.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	A debit card? That comes directly out of your account.

The government probably screen every phone call, text message, faxes and e-mail anyway.  This situation is not nearly as fictional as the majority of folks consider it to be.  The American government recently tried to pass a bill to make the monitoring of all e-mails, all telephone calls, faxes and texts legal i.e. not against your human rights or against the country's constitution.

AA10722993	This is constructive criticism, so please don't get angry!   Your spelling and grammar in that ad looks like it is written by a 10 year old!   You have "I except only money order!"    The word should be "accept".   Please have someone help you rewrite that ad, and maybe it will be more successful.  No one really cares that you had to pee often or had nausea.       The only good features of that camera to me is that it is probably more sturdy than most.  But it is only 3.6 optical zoom, has no viewfinder and can't be adjusted manually at all.   You may not even get the $200 if you start out with that amount.  Get some advice from an experienced ebay seller to see what bid you should start out with.   I do wish you luck in selling this camera.    And if you can't get what you think you should, why not keep it to take pics of your new little one?  You will need a camera!|`|k7MINvaIaa	Fairly slim for $200. Should start low to entice some bidding.    EDIT- the last line of your ad may in fact violate Ebay's terms of use in that you are encouraging bidders to work with you outside of the Ebay system.|`|cLmsF2W8aa	seems priced a little high|`|e76f94644ba717d14e758eb9252c03a8aa	Maybe $100-$150.      The "I only accept money order!" kind of turns me off though.  I just want to pay with PayPal and have it done with.  I don't really want to hassle going to the store to get a money order, sending it out and waiting weeks for the camera.  It's not that hard to get a PayPal, all you need is a bank account.|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	Money order only = Nope unless item is rare.  No reserve + starting bid  = good teaser.  A few too many words in listing.
AA11131134	It would likely be just as expensive, or more expensive, trying to get your Xbox fixed.  You would have to pay for the parts PLUS for labor.  Electronics repair shops would likely charge about $40-50 an hour for labor...at even 1 hour of shop time you could basically buy a used Xbox.    Game Stop sells used systems for about $60, and they offer a 30 day warranty on it.  I know you don't want a new console, but it might be the most cost effective method of being able to keep plahing the xbox games.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i dont know the price but i think gamestop would have the best price|`|GTUgFLDyaa	you can get a used original Xbox at gamestop for 50 dollars.|`|R6Civz9kaa	My advice would be that now is the time to get a 360.

dLULcTgcaa	iPhone. The iPhone is a very well rounded device. It is worth every penny in my opinion. It has hands down the best touch screen, and most fluid scrolling of any device.

So I suggest go for an iPhone|`|3toGqUUHaa	Iphone due to all the applications from iTunes.

fwnqB0dTaa	No one knows yet as RIM have not announced any dates for the official version yet - mainly as they are still developing other things to put in it.

The price is $180 for a 2 yr. contract. the krave is $230. the voyager is the cheapest: $130. The dare has a 3.2 mega pixel for the camera and camcorder if you like to take pics and vids. It also has a touch screen qwerty keyboard for easy txting. Also, on the dare qwerty keyboard, the buttons make the click click click sound which can be very loud in a quiet place.

fwnqB0dTaa	It is not necessarily the battery at fault, despite what "little miss short and normally wrong answers" has said.    It could be one of many problems.    Arcing/short being the most likely non battery related problem.    Depending on the hardness of the water it was dropped into, and how long it took to dry out, there could also be etching and/or limescale build up of the circuit boards    Take it to where you got it and ask them to test your battery for you, most good suppliers should be able to do this.    Once you know if it is the battery or not proceed from there, don't just get a new battery because someone on here, with little or no technical knowledge, tells you to do so.|`|LzSj90pbaa	It might not. You could have arcing in the phone that is draining the battery, but not enough to short the phone out. You could buy a new battery only to find out that it doesnt solve the problem. Then you are out of the cost of a battery and a new phone. Then again, if get the same phone, you will have an extra battery.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	of course. obivously its the battery thats causing the problem so i suggest you just buy a new one.

Should get a ps3 or 360 instead|`|a3FAGYgVaa	Some I consider must haves... of course, bottom line comes down to your own taste:    - Super Mario Galaxy  - Super Paper Mario  - Zelda: Twilight Princess  - Trauma Center games (both Second Opinion and New Blood, but if you go for just one, go for New Blood)  - de Blob  - Medal of Honnor Heroes 2  - Guital Hero: World Tour      If anything, IGN's "The 20 Wii games you should already have" article should help you out.

You could try getting a new cable as well, but it might be time to upgrade.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well read your TV users guide trouble shooting page,make sure everything is connected and hooked up right.|`|v1eUufHOaa	Time to get another one buddy !!!|`|mzRSO802aa	Call a TV repair guy.  He'll come out and tell you what's wrong with it and it might be something simple.      I had the same thing happen to my 42" Mitsubishi last year.  It also was a 2004 model.  It ended up costing me about $300 to get it fixed but that was a lot cheaper than having to replace it.

hHBTJPI1aa	My sister got a classic because it holds so much music (40,000 songs). The iTouch has a relatively slow internet, but is really cool. Games, movies, and everything. But it can only hold like 7500 songs. This is equivalent of 40,000 minutes of music.     I suggest the iPod Touch (iTouch). The nano is only good for a cheap, small version of the iTouch.|`|TaBsMJFBaa	Depends : )  If you want to play games and have a big budget, want a big screen for movies (and a big pocket I might ad) get a iPod touch.    If your very colorful, watch movies occasionally, smaller budget, don't mind a smaller screen and a smaller Device get a iPod Nano    If you want to fit your whole library and more, and you don't mind a thick device and for occasional movie playing it's alright.    If you just want to listen to music occasionaly and don't have a massive library, and for a $50 US its a good deal, Get a iPod shuffle|`|GuVNYGqyaa	ipod touch|`|e3LzkOvGaa	get an ipod touch the cheapest 1 is $230  you can watch youtube on it  the internet is very fast  plays videos music and some games|`|43de75718ceba943b37b3cc82da0e8eaaa	If you are only going to listen to a small collection of music, a Nano would be good. If you have a HUGE collection than the Classic would be best. Or if you want your iPod to be able to surf the web, play games, do hundreds of really cool things (apps), and play music and videos... than the iPod Touch would be the one.     I personally can HIGHLY recommend the Touch.

XIGJaU6kaa	Forget about Limewire. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.      PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|AFy5LyaGaa	you can try converting youtube to mp3, there alot of videos on youtube..    just go to http://zamzar.com/ and go to http://youtube.com/ right click on the video with the song you want, copy the url and paste it onto zamzar and convert it to mp3, make sure you enter your email address because they will send it to your email..    good luck!!|`|q0rGhf0vaa	UTorrent might be an option.

EsdqLD9Saa	What is your budget?  How much are you willing to spend. If you are only going to spend like $1000 then I would get the Canon HV20, with a Rode Videomic. Then I would probably buy Sony Vegas Platinum 9, (which comes with DVD Architect 4.5 or something like that). If you have a little more to spend I would get a Canon GL2 or Canon XH-A1 or Panasonic DVX100, with a Rode NTG-2. Then buy Sony Vegas Pro 8, which comes with dvd creation software. If you want to get real fancy with your DVD you should get DVDit, google it. If you add your budget to this info I can give you a much more accurate answer.|`|AA11629848	You can use any camera with 3CCD, for editing try Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 / CS4 or Sony Vegas Pro 8. Shooting instructional videos is an art on its own, you need to be aware of how you light the scene and also about the sound. An external mic works wonders, you can use boom mics or wireless mics, that allows you to place the camera a little further away from the subject and still have good audio. Using a green screen allows you to use a little corner in your garage / office and avoid the overhead cost of building a prop set (studio set / background).

So double all that|`|uC7IKCQ6aa	well actually 20 gig drives are about 13 or 14 gig drives (the xbox uses about 6 or 7 gigs for system updates and files)    it'll hold lots of saved games  don't rip discs, just stream them from your computer  demos: it depends on how big the demos are. some (res evil 5) is about 600 megs others can get up to 2 gigs

OhTPygYlaa	Can't you just tell Garmin to look on com 4? The Fuze has its own GPS receiver.  Hope that helps.
tHjBr4L4aa	The answer is simple.  A separate flash, such as a Nikon SB400 or a Nikon SB600 (my personal favorite) raises the source of light higher, so there is less chance of the lens casting a shadow on the subject.  Another advantage is that you can tilt the bounce head of the flash and use the ceiling or a simple white cardboard reflector to redirect the lighting.    Most photographers, fisheye or macro, don't use direct flash.  You'll find them using available light (push up your ISO) or bounce/reflected lighting.    I use my SB600 on my 135-400mm lens, and it's much longer than your 18-55mm + fisheye setup.  In fact, in it's shorter, retracted mode, it's already 7.2 inches long, and I always use a lenshood as well.  Zoomed out to 400mm, it's even longer!    Hope this helps.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	I'd vote against using the Holga flash. A high trigger voltage could fry your Nikon. If the Nikon flash is out of your price range then take a look at the Vivitar 285HV. Its about $90.00, has a tilt/swivel head, plenty of power and safe for your Nikon. Of course it isn't TTL compatible but if you'll spend a few minutes reading its Owner's Manual you'll be able to figure it out in no time.    NOTE: Be absolutely certain its a 285HV. The older 285 will definitely fry your Nikon's electronics.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	What everyone is neglecting to tell you is that a flash is not likely to fix the problem. The problem is not with your lack of flash but with the cheap screw on adapter that you put on your lens. Half of my lenses are longer than five inches and I never have this problem. If you spend your money on a real fisheye lens I can almost guarantee that this problem will go away. Go to a camera store and try one out.    I seriously doubt that the Holga flash would even work on your camera never mind whether it would fry it. I would recommend you use a Nikon flash but there are third party ones that are designed to work with Nikon. I wouldn't use a real cheap no name flash but a Quantaray or Sunpack wont fry your camera and will work fine.|`|AqKALUItaa	I use an old (but not real old) Vivitar 283 on my D40.   But before you put any non-iTTL flash on your camera you need to check the voltage across the sync contacts. Use an accurate volt meter, because you don't want to fry your camera.  My (real) old 283 has 300+ volts, so I don't use it.  The other 283 only has 8 volts and the D40 will handle up to 250 v. It works great, but you do have to set the camera to Manual and match the aperture to the flash sensor.  If you don't want to hassle with the voltage question, Wien makes an adapter that limits voltage. I think it's called a Safe Sync.
k2wiYJAcaa	No, you cant. I work for verizon, and this merge between Verizon and Alltell is similar to the merge between Sprint and Nextel. Although sprint bought nextel, you cant use nextel phones on sprint plans. The programming and default programs on the different carriers are not compatible with the Verizon plans/features, therefore, for now you can only use Verizon phones on a Verizon plan.|`|5x9EbHWlaa	Yes.
vk5R3sCzaa	I got that phone last month.  I personally love it.  At first the battery door would unscrew itself and come off, but I bought a case for it and now it doesn't do that.

If it was ON then it's probably fried. The rice thing is BS, you will not live longer enough for the rice to absorb the liquid. It takes 20 minutes in boiling water for rice to get soft. Kitty litter absorbs moisture instantly. Take out the battery, open it up and let it dry in a a warm place. DO NOT turn it on.

I once dropped my phone in the pool, blow dried the battery, and it never worked again. Try putting the battery back in or shaking it. If there is any response when you place the battery in and turn teh phone on you may have a chance. However, I would contact your service provider.|`|5QxrQF7yaa	yea but u have to take the battery out and let it dry and then once it drys over night put it back in and try it the speakers may have broke that happens alot when phones get wet|`|AABCy5mQaa	I dont know. Ive had one phone recover from slight water damage, but most of them were just done once the water hit it. Give the phone a few days and it might come back. Even if it may seem dry, the inside may still be very wet. Good luck.

From here you can change the controls to anything you desire.    EDIT: gbh101, if you're going to use an xbox 360 controller and complain about PC, you shouldn't be gaming with computers. Go and play your crappy console and stop whining. PC controls are simple and easy to use... for those intelligent enough of course (certainly not you).|`|m9j3kUH2aa	i know this doesn't answer your question but after buying an xbox 360 controller for windows 6 months ago, i strongly advise you buy one of these for games such as this. I've completed a lot of games recently with my Xbox 360 controller (NFS:Undercover,  Assassins Creed, Dead Space). Although a lot of games are better on a keyboard and mouse, i think a controller is worth the expense.    GTA IV is arriving tomorrow and i wont touch my keyboard and mouse while playing it.

s7Muujxzaa	You could hook a converter box to the VCR input and the VCR would still be able to record. However, since the tuner is now in the converter, the VCR would only be able to record on whatever channel you left the converter box on. The vCR will no longer have the ability to switch to specific channels and record automatically.|`|5a8d2673d4fb8554d0747c3b114ff002aa	nope - a vcr can only read channels like 3 not 3-1 and that is what they display on, on the hd channels, sorry - time to upgrade :)    The way a VCR works is it records what is displayed on your tv based on the channel you tell it to record. Well, your HD channels are all displayed like 3-1, 8-1, 26-1 etc.. and your vcr doesn't have an option for -1 channels, it only has like 3, 8,26, which are not HD channels, but standard channels. So, it will record the non-hd channels and never the HD ones.     Maybe stephen below has a good point. It would be like recording your cable/satallite on your vcr though redirecting your cables. (had to think about that one) your tv would be on channel 3 - and your converter box on the channel you want to record (ex, 8-1), you'd tell your vcr to record channel 3 (it's used as an input that way, instead of a channel) -  interesting :)  Maybe that would work  but it wont record in HD

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	nikon <br>  <br>  <br>   All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|cahGKBp7aa	I would recommend the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.<br>  Superb Imaging Performance <br>  ?  21.1 megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor for high resolution images of superb quality and details  <br>  ?

IOGSCjVxaa	if you get a new current ipod touch(second generation), it will already have that update and you WON"T have to pay an extra $10.    to get the free apps, you WILL need an itunes store account, and to make an account i believe you need a credit card number.

4DqUFgULaa	No, absolutely not.  As long as you use the QuickPwn tool properly - no.  It is entirely safe.  Yes, you do change some codes and packets,but they are constantly offering updates for various parts of the jail broken firmware which increases stability.  iPod Touch 2G cannot be jail broken yet, but if you have an iPod Touch 1G 2.2 or 2.2.1 follow this link to get QuickPwn:    http://www.quickpwn.com/    Also, I suggest getting the gpSphone from ZodTTd and various other emulators.  I can't give any links to repos for Cydia or Installer as it's illegal, but they're a lot of fun.|`|TvkR2ftsaa	You always run the risk of bricking it...  I would reccomend watching a lot of youtube videos so that you can be sure that you are preforming the jail break correctly!|`|W9v4mfiHaa	anytime you modify the programming it has a chance on messing up the ipod. If done correctly it will work fine, if done incorrectly the itouch can stop working completely. By hey you would have a pretty cool paper weight      Also it does void any and all warranty from Apple. Which means they will not touch it or help you.|`|TmJokyAoaa	Hi first of all please dont listen to people who tell you it is unsafe.  If something goes wrong during the process of jailbraking it you can always restore your ipod.  I have jailbroke mine 5 times. The method in which i used was Quickpwn which is the official jailbrake >http://www.quickpwn.com/  Download the version for which firmware you have.  If you have 2.2.1 for instance download the 2.2.1 version of quickpwn.  Once you download this sync your ipod touch and open up the quickpwn program. From here it is very very simple just follow the instructions they are very straight forward :) Look on the quickpwn website for the correct version for the firmware you have. This website offers other methods as well however quickpwn is the most straight forward, simple and safe :) I hope you find this helpfull and hope you have a good expierience. If you need extra help you could always look for howto videos on the subject on youtube.com :)

You need to get that solved first.<br>  <br>  If you can see messages from the box and the box can't find any channels, then you are not getting enough signal into the box.

FyE3BSIxaa	You should be able to visit the apartment with no one there. Furnish it however you like (since you shouldn't need any money to do this you can really go all out.) Then move your Sim in after you're finished. When your Sim moves out, unless there is someone staying behind all the furniture will be added to their net worth. Use the motherlode or kaching cheat for money if your Sim doesn't have enough to move in.|`|rCNRcF5waa	I'm sorry ahead of time, I don't know either.

The option should be there if you've entered the cheat correctly. <br>  <br>  Or you could head over to MATY and grab the latest hack for AL which automatically gives you the choice to rent furnished.

RQXN3cwkaa	It's true the film is no longer being made but you can still find it some places. If you're in NJ, Sandrian Camera has several packs in stock (link below).<br>  <br>  If you do find the film, make sure it has not past the expiration date stamped into the package.  This is very important with Polaroid film because the battery that powers the camera is actually built into the film cassette.  If the battery is old & dead, the camera will not work.<br>  <br>  Fuji has announced a new camera system that uses instant film just like Polaroid did (see link).  They make film for it too, but I'm pretty sure the film will not fit your Polaroid.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Polaroid doesn't make polaroid film anymore... Fuji still does. Try Walgreens.
HVQFVtelaa	I could have found you some simple software, but I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. The page below has the most amazing collection of recording software I've ever seen. The backbone is a sophisticated Wav & mp3 recorder and editor for recording, editing, mixing, and extracting with wav, mp3, and wma. It comes with 20 bonus programs and a sound effect library.<br>  <br>  The bonus programs are too good to be true, one solves the Windows nasty habit of alphabetizing songs from an album & changing the original play sequence. One let's you burn CD's with no pauses between tracks. One sets up a tune library automated jukebox. One is a CD to hard drive ripper with special abilities. One is a play list manager. One prints tracks and play-lists out instantly.<br>  <br>  All of these programs are compatible, and can work together, even adding special effects like echo and reverb. And,I've bought from this company for 30 years, I trust them completely.<br>  <br>  At this point, anything further is wasting your time, you need to click below and decide if this package is worth $25. Make a sandwich first, you'll be reading awhile.<br>  <br>  If this page doesn't get you're attention, I'll eat my keyboard.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dak.com/reviews/2050story.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dak.com/reviews/2050story.cfm</a>

US Cellular doesn;t want to become a gsm network and even if they wantted to they couldn't because don't have the funding. The only other way would be for apple to make a non gsm iPhone which again isn;t going to happen due to the fact of US Cellular not having enough money.

n5vWT6wMaa	All you have to do is make sure the title of the album and the name of the artist are exactly the same. If you have even one capital or lowercase letter different between them, iTunes will see them as different. Even one extra "space" will bring them up different. What I do is highlight one song then hold the "ctrl" key and highlight the others, right click select "get info" this is where you can enter the information for all of those you highlighted. If you bring up the "get info" and any of the info shows up already, you will know that that indicates you had that particular info the same on all that were selected. But here is the kicker, if you have all of that fixed and still have the same problem, you will have to go into each individual "get info" and delete the "album artist". I don't know about you but I could care less as to who designed the cover. I hope this helped. I typed this all on my itouch. I use mine constantly and have learned quite alot. Hook me up with 10 PTA if it helped.

0WXCISP0aa	*an iPod is just like a storage device - kinda like a USB. so all ur music/videos are in there but hidden -- all u need to do is unhide them    *before continuing-make sure u have iTunes ;)    *now just follow these steps:    1) connect ur iPod to ur PC/laptop  2) when iTunes opens up - DON'T CHOOSE THE "erase + sync" option. if iTunes didn't open don't worry    3) anyways go to My Computer > Apple iPod (disk) or whatever u named it (my iPod)    4) open it, and open the folder called "iPod_Control".  if its not their - then go to the Adress bar and type this:    iPod_Control    5) it will open and ull find folders called tones,gamestats, or whatever. now right-click in any space and un-check the HIDDEN option..  > "apply changes to this folder, subfoler, and files"    6) then ull see many more folders, including "MUSIC"  if its not there, then type in the Adress Bar:    Music    7) when u opened that folder, ull c other folders called "F-08"/"F-14"/etc.  if they're not there, then right-click in any space and un-check the "HIDDEN" option..    8) then there are all the folders with your music and videos! don't worry if the names are "DHSJ" or "FJDS"....    9) all u need to do know is copy eeeeeeeeeeverything into ANOTHER folder on ur desktop or anywhere u want in ur laptop/pc    10) open iTunes, and drag all ur songs/videos FROM THE FOLDER U CREATED ON UR DESKTOP OR ANYWHERE ELSE in the iTunes library. there names will come back!    11) then just sync ur iPod!

uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|XIGJaU6kaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.      PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	Flickrmusic has been a great place for me to obtain a great deal of music.

If you still want to keep those songs for later, I would transfer them to a music folder or something so they don't get permanently deleted.
lEYrs02Raa	You shouldn't be having problems with sound.  My SD1000 produces great sound when played back over the computer speakers, or even through the A/V hookup to the TV (that's what that jack output is by the way, it's NOT a phone jack).       Unless you're talking about playing back the video using the camera and listening to the sound over the camera's tiny speaker?  If this is the case, you can increase this playback volume by pressing the menu button, selecting the tools menu, cycling down and selecting the "volume" setting, and setting the "playback" selection to max volume.    If the above is not the case, the next thing to check is to make sure that the microphone is not blocked by dirt or gunk.  It's that tiny hole located on the front face of your camera, just to the left and below the lens (8 O'Clock position).  Take a close look and make sure there's no gunk in there.  Maybe blow some air at the hole but DO NOT poke anything into the hole.

iqHrzhYuaa	Well, Rhapsody is a subscription program, which means that you pay ~$15 to download unlimited songs, I believe.    I've heard that you have to pay extra charges, though, after subscription charges, to burn a song to CD. I believe that this is because of the fact that the files that you download 'expire' after a while, and you pay the purchase price.    People I know seem to like Rhapsody and the music they offer, but I (as a non-user) will NEVER be able to like anything made by RealNetworks, because the RealPlayer software doesn't like to delete itself. Please don't take my opinion, thoughh
AA10492776	First: The digital audio optical output of your HDTV can only deliver a 5.1 surround sound signal from the antenna input; any digital source (HDMI) or analog video source (Component or Composite video) is only going to transfer a 2 channel stereo signal to your Home Theater System. It is better to run the digital audio fiber optic cable direct from a HD cable set top box to the Home Theater input for true 5.1 surround sound capability, if you have a HD cable set top box.    Second: you need to use the function button on the Samsung Home Theater receiver to select "D-In" (Digital - Input). By selecting the Digital Input as your source, the Home Theater knows to process the audio on the digital audio fiber optic input port to the attached speakers.    Additional Details: Now you have just discovered why Home Theaters in a Box are not the best Home Theater Solution (they have very limited inputs for multiple external sources). It is far better to have purchased an A/V receiver like the Denon AVR-789 or a Home Theater System based on an A/V receiver like the Onkyo HT-S6100 system that actually has inputs for all your Home Electronic devices. Your best opportunity now (if you keep the Samsung Home Theater) is a TOSlink Selector Switch. With this device you connect your multiple sources with fiber optic cables to the TOSlink Selector Switch input ports and a signle fiber optic cable out to your Home Theater.

OosO8xxcaa	Hey- I was just at the T-Mobile store earlier today looking at the rates. It's $4.99 for 400 messages, $9.99 for 1000 messages, and $14.99 for unlimited messages. Also- each time you recieve OR send, it counts as a message. The texts include: domestic texts, instant messaging, picture, and video messaging. Hope that helps!
YeFi54U2aa	no|`|8H9eSDm8aa	I don't think they can do that. I'm assuming someone stole your xbox 360, and is using your account, and your afraid they'll get the card info.    Or your just really mad at someone lol.    I highly doubt thats possible, the only console in history that can brick itself via online service is the ps3. There was a new PSN update, and it bricked tons of consoles.
937e2e59b70bd2d72ef38a3a0c6b95adaa	No.. you are fine..     All the base Xbox 360 consoles are the same.. the Arcade/Pro/Elite bundles only differ in the bundled accessories and some color differences.. if you add HD cables, headset, network cable and a 120GB hard drive to the Arcade you have the functional equivalent of an Elite..    Good Luck..|`|9AR6B4ELaa	hi robert,  the arcade version has many difference from the regular 360. i'll tell you about it.    the arcade does not have the hard drive which the regular one has (known as the pro or premium version). the arcade version has only a 256 MB flash memory but you can upgrade it to 512 MB whereas the pro version has a 60 GB hard drive (you can save songs or video into it). and the pro version comes with a wireless headset in which it was sold seperately fot the arcade. the pro version has the chrome disc drive whereas the arcade has the white one which makes the pro version looks far more nicer. but for the HDMI cable, it is sold seperately for both of the consoles. the cable only comes with the elite. the way they build it is standard for all 360s which is they use the same Falcon motherboard. and i would suggest for you to invest on either the pro (the regular) 360 or the elite rather than the arcade.    i hope this has the info you needed.    pls vote me|`|c1sRWiX3aa	If your Arcade is 'newer' (ie manufactured in 2008) and has the HDMI input then, no, there is really no difference between it and the Pro.    When the Arcade first came out it didn't have an HDMI output, but as I said that was changed in 2008. It also only comes with composite cables and not component cables (also, doesn't come with an HDMI cable), but hardware wise it's exactly the same.    In fact, if your Arcade was very recently produced you might even have better hardware as the new 'Jasper' GPU just recently hit the shelves and everything I've read so far suggests it's only being seen in the Arcade models as of now.|`|IcsKkSfHaa	arcade are only have 256mb...but pro got 60gb..lots of difference in memory space..  pro also got hdtv cable but arcade got only tv cable...|`|IC0ELEmjaa	I don't think there is a difference other than the VERY ESSENTIAL  hard drive and siver detailing, but it may have a higher Red Ring of Death rate. Oh and wireless controllers cost more, use up your valuable double A's, and can become disconnected randomly. It is nice to have one, but wired controllers are more reliable and don't waste batteries

suDZDSr2aa	No. Switching carriers and keeping your number will completely cut all ties with the previous carrier. Any dropped calls you experience after the switch will be only due to the new carrier.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	No dropped calls aren't related to the number it's related to the network and the phone and honestly check the coverage with the new carriers web site because ALL carriers have dropped calls.|`|Bt3Hvh5Saa	u must get a new number

If you have some pictures on the card that you would like to recover first, here's some freeware photo recovery software that you may be needing if your computer no longer recognizes the card:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12...    You will need to use a flash card reader with this software.

Ei5m7K9naa	GoPhone by AT&T is an excellent service, one that i used for awhile.     Most major cell phone companies also offer a prepaid option.    However, since you live in  Wyoming, service might not be great. Links to major companies' coverage maps in source.
nCfarFc7aa	well what i would do is connect it from the modem to the xbox 360 wired connection and see what happens|`|sdcx2clBaa	Do the troubleshooting steps. If that doesn't work call 1-800-4my-xbox.
Qm5qpEKsaa	Nintendo offices usually repair their own appliances very efficiently.    http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/...    Also, you should be more specific about your problem. If it was a screen problem, you could probably fix that on your own with a replacement part.Small things you could probably do yourself, but if you feel that it's beyond you, contact Nintendo and look for an authorized repair service.|`|Z11DKA9Gaa	if it has warranty you could change it for another one|`|GdDUVvAzaa	I fix em' email me bestbuybooksca@gmail.com I am usually cheaper than nintendo
e032df0395b11a00a915ee41ad92113caa	No But if you have the ethernet cable for the Xbox 360 you can plug that to the the back of your computer. (The other end goes on the 360)  Before you turn on your 360, on your computer go to network,network and sharing center then manage network connections right click on your conection the go to properties. Click on sharing tab and click on the first box. The turn on your 360 and test the conection. you should then be connected to Xbox LIVE and when you sign up they give a one month trial

eac8411737600cb69167ca52e369872faa	Depends on the headphones.  If you are plugging into the headphone jack on the upper right side of the phone, then you can't do it.  That jack is for the music only.  You need to either get a bluetooth headset or the headset that plugs into the same port that you plug the power into.  The ATT store has one for about 20 dollars.

1HtTxOOQaa	I don't think the 360 is capable of full HD(except the elite) and since you have the older version, it's I think probably impossible. You need a HDMI slot in your 360. Too bad cause when MS learnt that the PS3 is coming out with HDMI, they decided that they need a 360 with HDMI.   You can contact MS and ask if there is any way(which I don't think there is). Even if you had a HDMI port, you would probably be able to transmit 720P to your TV. Sorry!!|`|IC0ELEmjaa	My Elite came with a component cable that was slightly different; it had an HD one with a blue and green and red connector, you may want to check your TV to see if it has that, I'm sorry that I don't know the name of it. I'd bet you can buy it somewhere, it came on the same thing as the regular RYW cables though|`|a9pHlV2raa	You go under setting on your Xbox account   and then under display there is a setting   with 1080p
2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	Yes.    It's free if it's still under warranty, and $75 if not.  Nintendo pays for shipping.      Go here to setup a repair:  http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/...|`|C7baXdSZaa	Yes but what happend to it???

My0D4lmVaa	It's still very unsure, but it's possible. The game has been DEMANDED by fans, so hopefully it'll be put on soon. No official confirmations, however.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Mushroom is right and yes it should man ive wanted to play that game for so long...And Lucas is better anyway!    I was about to ask this question LOL|`|wic6ut7Qaa	It's on the ESRB rating board, but there hasn't been any word of it coming to VC yet.     It has been heavily demanded, and every issue of Nintendo Power lately seems to have Earthbound as the   1 requested game for the Virtual Console (and the original Mother in second.)    For other info, check out www.starmen.net    Let's hope that Nintendo finally comes to their senses and starts to appreciate this amazing series.
ofpmRvHpaa	Yes - but there are complaints.    Older movies are shot on film and have 'grain'.  Many people are used to CGI based popcorn movies like "Spider Man" and "Transformers" which do not have grain.      When they take a older movie and copy it onto BluRay - it properly picks up the grain of the original film.  This tends to freak out younger people and they post here about "..how do I improve the picture.." when they tried to watch an older show and saw the grain.    A good example: the recent "Band of Brothers" series on BluRay. This has a LOT of grain and green/grey filters are used to mimic documentary style news clips from the war.  There is nothing wrong with peoples system, but they are un-used to this.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Film is the highest definition format available.  However, film degrades over time.  But it can be restored digitally.  So if the original source is restored then it *can* look as good or better than HD video, but that isn't always the case.

Qm5qpEKsaa	The text itself should be free because you have unlimited texting, but the anything that requires that you send data through your phone, or receive data uses the internet on your phone. You'll be charged a data fee per usage. I suspect version will tally up all the data you sent and received and you'll be billed a fixed rate of data/price for your usage.    Buy a data plan if you plan to send and receive audio or video. A texting plan does NOT cover audio/picture/video mail transfer.

Tell them that you want to buy a prepaid SIM. Its about $5 and you will usually get $10 worth of airtime.  Go to ebay, or any store that sells the phone you want without a contract. Buy the phone.  If its an ATT phone ( aka 'branded' it will say either ATT or Cingular on it) or is unlocked, simply pop your sim card in it, and youre good to go.  Unlocked means that you do not have to use the branded carrier.  It could say 'tmobile' on the phone, but if its unlocked, you will still be able to use it on ATT. If it is locked to Tmobile, then you annot use it on att. (however, it MUST be a gsm phone.. i dont know if you know that part)  You would fill the minutes the same way you do now. You could buy prepaid cards and enter the numbers, you could add minutes with a credit card, or you could add minutes using the att kiosk.  Some additional info:  If you take your tracphone to att, you can have them port the number over to the new att sim card, so you will keep your same number. Its free of charge and it usually is activated with the old number in 24 hours.

Qm5qpEKsaa	you have to place the isos you've got onto a virtual drive or burn them onto a cd. I assume you did the latter incorrectly so finger around with your iso burner (I personally use alcohol 120 for my iso purposes) until you can generate virtual drives. From there, all you have to do is, using the iso program, drag the iso to the drive. Another popular iso mounting software is called daemon tools. I find daemon tools less.. well.. noob friendly and I suggest alcohol, but I'm willing to put my money on the fact that daemon has better support and guides. Try youtube and other video sites like metacafe for tutorials too.|`|SRQSFaaIaa	ok well ive tried using torrents and sometimes the file is right so you may get messages like these.but if you want to make it work you can buy the disc from the store. i know it sucks that u have to buy it rite

XIGJaU6kaa	Forget about Limewire and Frostwire. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.      PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|nhftr3j2aa	Im using frostwire for mac and its working fine but if you want to stick to something faster, try going to a bittorrent called Azureus, I know for windows you can download music and things off that but for mac i haven't tried.

dLULcTgcaa	I am not a big fan of the invisibleSHIELD. They are very very very hard to apply to your device. I bought one for my Samsung Alias, and ended up wasting 30$. My advice is to get a snap on case. I recently upgraded to the Voyager and bought a snap on case, and haven't had a problem yet. I think it was $4.99 on ebay. If you were to get an invisibleSHIELD and apply it correctly it should protect your device pretty good.|`|PRqCRJm3aa	haha, i have the same phone, they dont have good cases, or shiields out yet, wait about 3 months for them, then buy one, thats when its easiest...    p.s.    i drop mine all the time, i'm 13, and its still ok, but just try to be more careful.|`|RWYupRTTaa	I have invisibleSHIELD on my eternity, and I like it very much.  it protected my phone few time already.
3CJAUyqPaa	If you want best video quality then you will get something using miniDV tape. It compresses video - in this case HDV - much less than AVCHD. Especially the anemic consumer-type AVCHD associate with many consumer cams. AND, AVCHD video requires the CURRENT version of FinalCut or iMovieHD '08 (or newer) running on an Intel Mac - earlier versions cannt deal with AVCHD; non-Intel-Macs cannot deal with AVCHD.    The miniDV version is the HDR-HC9. That - and a 4-pin to 6-pin firewire cable (and possibly a custom install of the Apple Intermediate Codec from the OSX system discs) will drop you into 1080i high definition land.    In either case, these consumer cams have smallish lenses and imaging chips, so low-light behavior will not be too good. This is not a Sony issue... Low light behavior starts getting good with larger lenses... The HDR-FX1000 is a good start. So is the HVR-V1U. But they are also more than the HDR-CX11/CX12.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	This one is great http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BET...

2235a96a63c564e70804806a305bcd5aaa	Browsing is fine on the sony mylo, depends on router and internet speed, youtube is great.     Between the Sony Mylo2 and Archos comes down to features really.    Their are a couple things Archos 5 has that sony doesn't (for the difference in price you have to know their are extras) its a 7 inch(I think), has opera browser supports flash 9 , gps ready, up to 60gb hard drive, and hook ups to tv which is cool in a old fashion way since you probably won't use it so much as there are sites on the web where you can stream episodes live and movies being in digital download form doesn't need a tv anymore but none the less cool feature that can't be taken for granted also full touch screen including keyboard.     Now I have a Sony Mylo 2 and it has flaws but at $200 its a different tool. It has a flashlite browser (adobe) funny enough it doesn't support some flash 9 applications but youtube works, has a qwerty keyboard which similar to touch screen rely on tapping with 1 or 2 fingers which is slower then you would a regular keyboard. The one thing sony has on the device is it doesn't rely on internal memory and if you are a sony fan well this is for you then because the sony mylo only comes with 1gb internal but don't let it fool you because it can take up to a 16gb memory stick which if you have other devices such as a cybershot you won't get stuck with the 1.3mp camera (its ok not great) you can use up to a 7mp cybershot and place it in the mylo to send, Also the sony webbie hd records mp4 which I wonder if mylo supports playback if so very good.  Before I said if you are a sony fan, great thing about memory stick duo is that you can place it in most sony products (also if you have the slot) no need to usb which is great, worst feeling in the world is moving a electronic device from a computer and seeing some memory gone because on windows you didn't safely remove and stop the items use before disconnecting. Also you can drop and drag digital files easier with the mylo.      Let down is just like all portable devices these devices may resort to having to use a mobile sites (more so on the sony then archos because of the browser opera is a fully used web browser its better on archos as flashlite (adobe portable) on sony is limited hopefully firmware updates will fix some issues). One thing I can't figure out is on the archos site it says movies and music for video but wifi drains batteries faster so how long can you say on the web with a 7inch highres screen. Sony Mylo is more portable.     The 1.3mp is great to be on the sony mylo the photos are of ok quality, it records video which I find to be smoother and more use then stills.     Best tip to think about is going for a cellphone especially if you are willing to spend $449, save some more money get a smart phone, iphone, blackberry, whatever and get the 3g network plan so you can use the internet from anywhere. For that much money you can also get a nice laptop these days even a netbook.|`|sCh9eDYjaa	For chatting, mylo-2 is pretty good. We had a little pain when we first got it getting the mylo-2 to log into our chat accounts. After that it's worked fine, though. I just wouldn't recommend it for too much browsing or looking at youtube (especially trying to watch youtube. It's intolerable).

ejATuQiwaa	well, first of all, ps2 games are region protected so a ps2 game that was bought in America wouldn't work with a ps2 bought in Australia. There is a way to make your ps2 all regions. You have to get a modification chip. You can find a guy to do this from the trading post or continuous browsing or the internet.

0xz8mR2xaa	Pretty much any high-definition plasma will have an internal ATSC tuner for digital TV reception in glorious high definition.

dbaPuwv4aa	I have unlimited texting in and out of verizon, and for  everyone on your plan its an extra $10 a month. That's  what my dad got for me, him, and my sister. It also includes  in and out of verizon video and pictures messages. So you can  send and receive unlimited from anyone, including if you get  ringtones from a website where they send through an e-mail  attachment.|`|7lzAf0Dsaa	you have to ask for it.  its usually a little extra to see them, like $5|`|CNotcjbaaa	First of all, what cell phone carrier do you have?    Most plans are 10$ a month. I'm Verizon and for me, it's 10$ a month, unlimited to other verizon and 5000 for outsiders of verizon. 5$ for 250 for verizona nd non-verizon.
Ur6H8gwkaa	Yes and no.    If you get a strong enough signal with digital TV, the picture will be perfectly clear.    But as the signal gets weaker, it just drops out totally.    Unlike analog where the signal will degrade more and more the weaker the signal, digital works a little differently. When the signal hits a certain threshold, it just goes out.    You can see this now with Sirius SAT radio, and DirecTV, there is no such thing as a fuzzy picture or sound, you either have it or you don't.    The downside of digital TV is that people that are within range of a analog transmitter that currently get a slightly grainy picture (but still good enough to watch) might be in a situation where they won't get the digital signal station at all because it's just too weak.|`|slHUNl58aa	They do were I am, we have a box already and the channels that have  converted ahead of time come in great..we had a lot more interference before.

Nintendo would think twice about not making one. We just need to wait for them to make all the game-play, voice acting, background music, graphics, etc.     It would be cool if you can use all 4 controllers to play (like SSBB) in the game and with a good Multiplayer mode, along with online play! That would be very exciting and cool!|`|jKc7aDCwaa	I'd say chances are good... and here's to hoping they do. Using the Wiimote as a flightstick would be pretty cool.     "The Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto has shown interest in creating a Star Fox game for the Wii console in the future. As of now, however, no plot has been announced. Miyamoto has suggested the Wii Remote would work really well for controlling an Arwing, while series designer Takaya Imamura has also said he has some ideas for a sequel."

It's expensive!     any way if you have the basic $29.99 you will not be eligible for a discount of new phone since the minimum plan rate should be of $34.99 to receive a phone discount.

VcNHahtgaa	Well, my parents just got me a PS3 for Chritmas, and when my dad found out games are $59.99 now [New PS2 games were $49.99], he became mad and told me I couldn't buy new games as often now lol.      Right now, I look for the best deals in the internet from different companys like Fry's, Best Buy and Wal-Mart. When I find something good, I tell my dad if he can buy it for me or not. For instance, GTA4 was on sale in Best Buy for only $37.99.    Right now, I found out the Midnight Club is only $9.99 at Best Buy if your a rewards zone member, and my dad is one so I might get that soon.    To be honest, I am trying to conserve my parents money now since games cost a lot and my mom got laid off. When PS2 was out, I bought a lot of games, maybe 2 games in 1 week. Now that I am older, I look for the best deals then tell my parents.     But for sure, I'll be getting Killzone 2 next month, worth the $59.99 it is.    After that, I won't buy a game for a long time unless there's a good deal :P.|`|9sRUf4zEaa	When I first got PS3, I was getting games once every month for 6 months.

7nmzxp4Iaa	If you are talking about a satellite vs. street names then tap the bottom right.  It folds up the map and you can select the map type. If you mean street view where you actually see the area from the ground just search for what you want to see, tap the pin and if it's available there will be an orange person by the name, tap it.  As long as you have the latest firmware it will go into street view.      Don't forget best answer! =)

OosO8xxcaa	Hi- The pricing did go up! It USED to be $20 bucks for unlimted everything. Now the rate plan is $24.99 for 400 texts, instant messages, picture texts, and email. For $34.99 you get UNLIMITED texts, instant messages, picture texts, and email. For either data add on plans, it includes unlimted web browsing. Please Note: the $34.99 or $24.99 is priced ontop of the voice plan.    I pay $20 bucks for my sidekick plan- since I got it 3 years ago.    Hope this helps!|`|lJAaBmlyaa	Yes the plan did go from $20 to $34.99 with the unlimited text. If you have the $20 rate you will be able to keep it.

It may not come out as true surround sound since the TV may only output stereo, but at least the sound should come from all speakers.
RyvKws7Laa	Give it a day or so and see if it burns out.  New Plasmas have to condition the gasses.  As part of the conditioning process, for the first 100-200 hours of use, keep the brightness and contrast (picture) cranked way down.  After that then go ahead and optimize.    If it still remains after you hit those hours and if you've given it some time to burn out, then you might need to get a Panasonic rep on the phone to have someone come out and check it.

It is a known problem.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_te...|`|FjdU3gzpaa	A similar thing happened to me.    I thought it wouldn't help but it did..    I called 1800 4 MY XBOX and when you call keep saying Agent, Agent. And then it will bring you to an agent.    THen the guy talks to you and you tell him what happened and then he gives you advice and if it doesn't work then he gives you a tracking number and he will send you an e-mail that you will have to ship your XBOX back, and if it has a warranty, for free.    Funny thing is that happened to me and I was just checking my Repair Status for my XBOX and it is coming back soon =)    Good Luck! :-)  Hope it gets fixed!|`|qpn8c2lqaa	I don't know what it is, but it seems that the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 always blow up for no apparent reason T_T    That's why I got a wii...|`|nssP8Lp0aa	xbox 360 bottom right red light how tofix    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXuz7VY9O...|`|KSsOiWj1aa	That same thing happened to me yesterday! You where lucky though, because mine just brings up a black screen that reads "system error, contact microsoft for more information" and it had the error code E74. After contacting microsoft, who was of no help at all, i might add, the only way it can be fixed by sending it in for repair.  My warranty expired last month and since my box has only 1 light of red, it doesn't qualify for the three year ex. warranty. That warranty is only good if your system has 3 red lights. So to sum it up, if you have 1,2, or 4 red lights and your warranty is expired, you either have to get a new system ( im gonna buy one from game stop, much cheaper) or pay $92 for them to "fix" it.  Ive had several buddies of mine get theirs repaired and like 2 months later they got the red rings again! I would recommend just buying a new one, repairing your old system is a waste of your money!

Most important thing is that the laptop have a dedicated graphics card with at least 256mb. It will be dual core with at least 2 ghz minimum and 3gb ram. A laptop with these specifications will at least run for $1,000. Dell has computers with these specs if you don't mind Dell.     Oh yeah if you want to game do not buy a Mac you need to buy a PC laptop.|`|xSu5A4eYaa	Alien spyware, gateware|`|FPONPOlHaa	HP or compaq. no doubt.|`|QTwddHlcaa	A mac because they never slow down after you install alot of games|`|gwNHbrz0aa	One with a dedicated graphics card built in.  Don't expect phenomenal battery life, but there's no other way around it if you want to TRULY game.    With that said, brand doesn't matter.  Just make sure when you're reading the specs it says something like, "Dedicated 256mb (preferably more) *blah blah blah* graphics card".  Dedicated is the key word.    It would be a waste of breath to tell you , "OMG spend 4k on an Alienware or... Hp is good." The fact is, as long as it has maybe 3+gb ram and at least a decent dedicated card.  You're not going to find a junk laptop and it'll probably play 90+% of the games out there.
hHBTJPI1aa	Battery still is used in the sleep mode. That's how it comes out of sleep so fast.

iZEAJGK3aa	the "radio" just refers to the connection to the network. if the battery is too dead, the phone will not shut off for quite some time, but it will be unusable to make calls or send texts. charge it a while, and it should be fine

These are the new audio formats for blueray. Look at the back of a blueray box movie from block buster (Look in the back at The bottom) and you will see the audio format..      The receiver you have in the link is good for a regular dvd home theatre setup. The audio fornat is Dolby Digital, DTS, Dolby Digital 2|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You have a Blu-ray player, so disregard any home theater in a box (HTIB) that is player-based.  Concentrate instead on finding one that is receiver-based.  In my opinion the best value in such HTIBs are made by Onkyo.  With your HD devices you'll want an HDMI switcher rather than HDMI pass through.  Pass through models like the HT-S5100 don't process any audio or video signals, so you're not going to get uncompressed audio out of it, only the core lossy formats.  Besides this complaint the 5100 is a good system.  However, I recommend the HT-S6100, or the HT-S7100 or HT-S9100THX if you have money to burn.  They're about $600, $800 and $1,000 respectively.    http://www.us.onkyo.com/prod_class.cfm?c...
VcNHahtgaa	You do know we are stealing Exclusives from Microsoft also right?    Here's some that were made for Xbox 360 then ported to PS3, and some that we stole also:    -Dead Rising 2 [Confirmed to come PS3]  -BioShock [was an Xbox 360 exclusive, also Game of the Year 2007]  -Far Cry 2  -Fallout 3  -Orange Box  -Mass Effect [Rumored to come PS3]  -Tales of Vesperia [Rumored to come PS3]  -Left 4 Dead [Rumored]  -Gear of War 3 [Rumored that the Third will come to PS3 because Microsoft only made a 2 game deal with developers, now the contract is up.]  -Saint's Row 2  -Lost Planet  -Condemned 2  -Vampire Rain  -Haze [Became an Exclusive, but a very bad one]  -FEAR  -Oblivion [Game of the Year 2006]  -Two Worlds  -Sacred 2  -Overlord  -ArmA 2  -Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII  -Enchanted ARMS  -Eternal Sonata  -Enemy Territory: Quake War  -TimeShift  -Kingdom Under Fire 2  -Doom 4  -Omikron 2  -Postal 3  -Unreal Tournament  -Ninja Gaiden    As you can see, we took a lot of their exclusives also.    Also, Call of Duty 4 COULD have been exclusive to PS3, but Sony wasn't interested in paying them. I think Activision [Makers/Developers] asked Sony if they would like it to be exclusive.      Don't listen to the guy who said "because there's more 360's"  There's currently 20million PS3's out there and 27 million 360's. But 360's have been out 1 year longer than the PS3.|`|uctxzjIIaa	If you can find a way to port the game cheaply, why would you limit your audience to just one system, unless you are the maker of that system? As the costs to make games goes up (blame the High def graphics for this primarily), the need from a business perspective to do this grow.|`|AA12146249	thats easy it's called money!!! but it goes both ways like Bioshock, 3he Orange Box, and Left 4 Dead when it comes out|`|C7baXdSZaa	well the most likely reason i am not lying here is because not many people own ps3  only like 12 mill and xbox has around mil so if you sold a great game and could sell it to 20 million extra people wouldnt you do that? Think of call of duty 4 if it only sold the game to ps3 owners then only 12 mill could enjoy the great game even though 20 million other people wont the game so if you sell it to the 20 mill. you get more money.|`|3AChQgbZaa	3rd party developers are doing it to make more money.  last gen the ps2 had a massive amrket share, this gen it makes more sense to make them multi platform.  Dont worry though sony has a lot of first party devs, but they are great devs such as naughty dog, polyphony, guerrilla games    and final fantast series was exclusive to NES and SNES before VII|`|pl2SocVKaa	they just want to make more money|`|tas2J7F4aa	1-maybe the game manufacturer think that if the game being multi-platform it will generate more profit then EXCLUSIVESLY own by playstation.  2- maybe Microsoft pay them so they game can be play on their console or playstation not give enough money to maintain the EXCLUSIVESnes.|`|785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	It's because those games are made from 3rd party developers, so Microsoft can buy from them if they are willing.|`|pOi0wewIaa	It's because Microsoft paid the companies that made those games with big money to go multi-platform. The economy has nothing to do with the Multi-platform games.|`|6y2SZDQeaa	THE ECONOMY :P|`|Zy0OcOpeaa	Because Microsoft is paying companies for extra features and Games to come to the xbox 360.    Its kind of like bribing, doesnt really have to do anything about the economy.     e.x Microsoft paid $50 million dollars for the DLC coming out for GTA 4.     They also offer money to game developers, to make games for the 360.|`|SZkSRBRLaa	Dude Tekken 6 ain't going multi. If you've watched the trailer it plays the PS3 logo before. Besides Final Fantasty looks better on PS3|`|GlpdHPTraa	Well I know one thing was that sony decided to quit paying extra to keep the games exclusive that why grand theft auto 4 went multi-platform. Before xbox got their paws on that game rockstar came to sony and sony pretty much told them they weren't going to pay the extra cash to get the exclusive sony feels that their TRUE fans will buy their console and feel that the money they didn't use for exclusives game they can use to better the console in upgrades, customer support, and free online features. While xbox is spending all the money to persuade game developers to go multi in games their weakness is the fact they choose not to fix their RROD!|`|1ykhOBLuaa	money!!!!!!!!!!
GZKbvXLLaa	Its kind of funny to see all those people flocking to these 'going out of business' sales. At only 10% off, the circuit city closest to me was jam packed with people, and yes, they were buying. What they seem to be missing is the fact that a $300 camera is only getting a $30 discount off their already too high prices. These are items that you would normally buy online for much less than the discounted 'going out of business' price.|`|AA10722993	This happens with a lot of stores that close.   Some other store will buy their inventory, so they don't have to bring the prices down too far.|`|5e1843a800af8a0c4fa0753cee310ddbaa	yea i know, expect the prices to really drop on the final days they are open|`|Wd1bljhxaa	IKR...I HATE  THAT...THATS WHY  THEY ARE CLOSING   ONCE AND FOR ALL...
a4b0e58e7fc3d933670b14375b88b2cdaa	Uhhh...do you mean you sold your phone or your actual sim card? It would make no sense to sell your sim card as all of your personal information is tied to it from the carrier. The sim card's more important then the phone in terms of information. Under no circustance should you sell an activated sim card with your information on it.    If it's a prepaid phone that you activated yourself then you're okay as the carrier hasn't attached your personal account information to the card. If you want to erease contacts, sms, etc. there's usually a setting in the phone (phone settings) that will allow you to clear the sim card back to its default state. I hope this helps.

2uiuOpSvaa	If you call to express your shock at the high number of text and to change your subscription to a plan that allows more texts, they will, if you ask, give you some retroactive courtesy texts.  That will severely reduce your bill and then, maybe you will only be half dead.|`|AA11570236	If you were my daughter ,I would take it from you,indefinitely.|`|bgWfcplBaa	This happened to me when my lovely daughter did the same thing.  I called and added the unlimited before the billing came out and they applied it to the current month.     You gotta tell your mom the truth because she will be LIVID if she gets that bill!|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	Next time control your actions...you knew this would happen but you did it anyway. I don't mean to sound harsh but seriously.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Has the bill been printed? If not, if its before the end of the month plan, hurry call and expand to unlimited text, most providers do it, the next month, on the first day of the new plan month switch back to your normal plan, they may charge a month in advance, dont worry it will all wash out normal the next month. If the bill is ready already, yes you are a dead man. I have seen this on the news recently, you are bad bad bad, and u know what as soon as you can get a job you need to and hand over every single dollar to mom, her credit is on the line now big time.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Yeah you are screwed. You can't do anything now but pay for it yourself.   Or get her to pay and pay her back.   Tell her to get you unlimited because I am sure it is much cheaper than getting 2000 over!    If she refuses, just use the phone. TALK! That's what its for.   Instead of wasting texts on "lols" and "rofls"...use it when you need it.     This is why kids shouldn't have cellphones. And if you are not a kid...get a job and pay yourself.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	How could you possibly not realize that you were over??? You had to know you were over.

GET A JOB!!!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Nothing to do but pay it....|`|ujT5teZgaa	too much time spending "sexting"|`|i8ySLyjLaa	babysit and apologize    babysitting for the right ppl gives good money    also try locking your phone somewhere...if it is harder to get to, your body will feel like it isn't worth the effort to go unlock something every time you have to text|`|TPn3CEK0aa	LOL FOR REAL!?!?!?  I had the SAME plan thing, with the 250 a month txts then you have to start paying....  I went WWWAYYY  over, the phone bill was up too $600.    I dont know, my dad is an awsome dad.  YOur assss is grass though if you have to really worry.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Wow, you are in some kind of trouble.      You really showed your mom how responsible you are.  You are probably gonna lose the phone.    How would you like us to help?  Send you money?|`|KjzsYV9uaa	Haha that's why you tell your mom that you'll pay the cost for unlimted txt instead of paying 200 dollars for those txts|`|wnbz5gNzaa	I have called the retention department and advised them of what a great customer you have been, then ask if they can do a one time removal of charges. I have been successfull more than once.|`|6od8qaU2aa	stop texting?|`|om0zcFigaa	LOL omg 250 to 2000? GOOD LUCK!|`|oq0jpqAgaa	time for you to get a job.|`|qJDNIRjraa	You're mom should have spent the extra money for unlimited, because now she's going to be paying even more than that.      But, you can't say that.    You're screwed!!!|`|3qrSUE7uaa	Haha, owned.|`|i98X99Q8aa	Oh my god... ummm    Figure out how much $ it is to pay for that extra 2000 texts and then try explaining to your mom that it would be cheaper to get unlimited (if it's cheaper) ... if you are old enough you could get a job, or do some extra chores like shoveling snow or somethings like that. Garage sale anybody???    It might be a tough decision but try cutting down on your texts by... idk maybe a 1500 texts or so... I have 250 limit per month and I only use like 100 texts every 3 months, so I can't say I know how you feel.    Look on the bright side!!! You will probably learn something from all of this!!! If not then... Good luck in the future!    I will edit this when I think of other ideas.    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|tK9vi25Daa	lot of money =P    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	You can try selling nickles for five cents.|`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	I hope you got something worthwhile out of it.|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	say that if you get unlimited you'll lower your minutes.|`|y3jRbaTQaa	Woahhhhhh  GooodLuck getting some money|`|yUxh8Eozaa	well heres a few options    stop using the phone   call the phone company and tell them you want unlimited and will pay for the previous months unlimited if they take the overcharge away  just call the dang people|`|AA11739944	convince her that it would be cheaper to pay for the unlimited than to pay fees for going over every month.|`|u3sw0LMpaa	I was in the same situation, except each text was 15 cents. I went to like 2,500 texts and my dad was furious, so i told him that unlimited is cheaper and it comes in handy and how it is hard to stay limited because texting keeps going when your in a conversation. Try telling your mom something like that =)Peace on Earth =)|`|9oCrDNe2aa	Be honest and own up to what you did.  There are other ways, but I recommend the first.  Apologize profusely, and make your mom breakfast and give her a massage while she watches her favorite reality tv show.    When she asks you what you want, tell her you were just being irresponsible and went over your limit, and you're willing to take full responsibility for it. (Trust me, parents love that kind of thing    . But be glad you even have it...|`|DKsc9zEbaa	omg, you totally went overboard. your bill is likely over $100 and now it's probably high. earn money to pay your mom back and FAST! otherwise you'll be dead meat.|`|py0DpCh4aa	What is your question.

(: it worked|`|s3AwAF4saa	absolutly nothing|`|EgfL2c86aa	wow. that sucks. lol sorry. try apologizing first off and offer to pay for some of it. get a job or take up babysitting. and meanwhile invest in t-mobile =]|`|sUik60LTaa	strart saving money and pay for it but tell ur ma b4 she gets the bill. do not let her find out through the bill  and give her some money when you tell her too|`|ucr4J8kcaa	Well, there's nothing you can do at this point, but I'm sure after getting the phone bill she'll either cut off text messaging entirely or get you unlimited.    My dad texts me so when I went over he got me unlimited. I didn't even get in trouble. Haha.    Do you make any money or allowance or anything? Offer to pay for whatever extra the unlimited text messaging will be. I pay for just my media stuff with my iphone and my parents pay the rest.|`|AA12367807	What the heck do you expect me to do. Get a job!|`|Y9Hm6fYWaa	Do you know her social security number? If you do, call your service provider and ask them to put on an unlimited package before the bill is issued. Then just suck it up and pay the $30 or whatever the charge is. You'll still get in trouble but at least its not like $500 bucks.|`|XMKw6iOiaa	...shame dude. sorry... o well, do better next month|`|euxRjS4naa	wth ?  2000 and you didn't even text me ?  okay , i see how it is ,  and to think i was gonna ask you out , hmmph !|`|H21Un2fiaa	I use at&t  i don't know what you use, but im on the family plan and its cheaper for your whole family to get on the family plan and everybody can get unlimited for cheaper than everyone getting the 250 plan.  I had the 250 once and i did 80 the first day i got it :(  So good luck. and God bless :)|`|lFPsPzxzaa	suffer the consequences u knew u only had 250|`|BZuaEyseaa	its your fault anyway..     first of all you should know your limitation...    anyway again..    just face the consequences..     you'll make it through soon..     talk to your mom.. and say "sorry I did'nt mean it"     make your self happy always..     hehe..  ...|`|TYxUM1PYaa	That happened to me when I switched to T-mobile, the guy told me "my favs" also included text messaging. That was wrong, my bill went from $70 to well over $350. I called them and explained what happened, although they wouldn't drop the charges, what they did do was allow me to pay it off in as many little installments as I needed. Just call and ask the phone provider. Also, they maybe able to change your plan so that it still costs the same every month but you get more messages, i.e. less talking minutes in exchange for more texts.|`|v4z8htW1aa	have your own job =)|`|I7rh95Dkaa	wow.. give her some time to calm down and, show some more responsibility by, keeping the household clean etc. and  basically(kissing her butt) when the trap is shut in the sweetest way try and convince her to get you unlimited....oh and also apologize  alot (act sad and dissapointed until she gives in)    .....hope this helps it works for me|`|7OiXvuO5aa	hi, work an instalment plan with your mother....  tell her the huge figure ( 2000) was due to the recent holiday season..  and that you will tone it down soon...    Get her to pay for you first..mothers or rather parents love "honest" kids....and will think you had good sense in "talking it out" with them.    tell her you will pay back in instalments..maybe get a part time job..  anwyay, you shd be responsible for your own actions...    cheers..|`|eOX8U3bAaa	Sometimes.....and I mean sometimes.....if you ask very nicely...the cell company may work with you and might forgive the debt all together.  It never hurts to ask.    However, You'll be lucky if your mother lets you keep your phone, at all.    Does anyone smell burnt toast?|`|1cL06jyTaa	your best argument would be   that the amount that your moms paying for this month   would be way less if you had unlimited    and if she pulls the "well you need to control yourself young lady" c.rap    then say that your social life and overall life quality actually really depends on your ability to have enough minutes to talk to people    if they ask how  tell them cause its your only means of building relationships and not spending all your time at home    as for this month your pretty fuc ked and your best bet would probably to say sorry and do some extra jobs around the house that your parents will probably forget about    that also works for getting unlimited texting   tell them youll do jobs around the house that would cover the diffrence in prices between your current plan and the one you want    i did that and my parents totally forgot about the tons of ridiculous jobs i said i would do after a week|`|1TKfwDGsaa	Cut down on texting people who you know can take a phone call, especially when you can make a phone call. Texting is done mostly because people don't want to actually have to say things verbally to each other, and thus be a witness to their reaction. It's okay even if you're not good on the phone, it is better than the alternative texting bills.|`|FJVwsYCOaa	elplain the situation to your mom calmly. trust me it will a lot worse if she finds out by her own. and the obvious remedy to this situation is to get your mom to pay the bill or simply get a job. best of luck!!|`|LN2oLOg8aa	sorry.. next time just limit your texting. financial answers? get a job!|`|AA11458683	IF YOU HAVE ATT THEN YOU CAN CALL THEM AND HAVE HER ADD THE UNLIMITED FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS SO THEY WILL RERATE UR BILL AS IF YOU WERE ON THE UNLIMITED SO YOU WONT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THOSE 2000 THAT YOU USED THEN YOU CAN CALL AND TAKE OFF THE UNLIMITED PLAN AND ADD BACK THE 200 OR 250...

Maybe they can break the payment up over several months.|`|uGvVMYsqaa	o0oo you have to find a way to pay her back for the extra txts you sent.  I think you should ask her to pay you pocket money weekly so that you can pay for your own unlimited txting and other personal things..?  unlimited is what like $10 per month..? thats not a huge amount|`|xO15PzZzaa	dont text any more.  qet a friqqin job.  and qive yer mom all the money you qet.|`|yFL2aHi3aa	that sucks! that i went over just like 1000 and i got my phone taken away...just suck up alot and convince her how great unlimited is! =]|`|TQHHH7kxaa	well girl i hope u have a job that is alot of money|`|NPByt7D3aa	kijiji some of your other expensive items    www.kijiji.com|`|HbayB338aa	just help ur mom pay it then tell her u won't  do it again|`|r5p9Hr20aa	i had the same problem like 2 years ago, so my mom discontinued my texting for 6 months til i convinced her i can stay within my 200 text limit then she let me get the 200 texting plan, but then she somehow came around and put unlmtd texting into my phone plan, which i didn't even have to ask for, the people at AT&T convinced her to get the unlmtd texting :)    for you however, i suggest telling your mom immediately so that she won't freak once she sees the bill and BEG FOR UNLIMITED TEXTING. or get a job. or call the cellphone company & explain the situation to them & ask them to disregard your text overages.|`|cbcbab86777e066cac6fcb2864f0274faa	Depending on what service you are with, i guarantee its cheaper to get unlimited....if you have a 250 limit and when over by 2000 the least a text cost is 5 cents so that's 100 dollars gone when you can just get unlimited and its from what i know no more than 20 dollars added on to your monthly bill....if you are like me and have tmobile  and don't really talk on the phone that much you can take your minutes down for example i only have 300 anytime minutes which is like 40.00 a month and then add the unlimited text and your bill will be around 60 to 70 dollars a month....or you can just ask her to add more up your limit because to be honest 250 it not enough i do about 300 a day!!! (im am textaholic =] )...and that could cost anywhere from 7 to 15 dollars added onto your monthly bill, so when she has to pay that one hundred dollars or more, just run it by her in a nice way that it would be much easier to just get unlimited....I advice you too go to the site where you have your service (like tmobile verizon ATT) and just browse around and see how much it will come up to get up the nerve print out some stuff and show it to your mom......i know that was a long answer (sorry) but i hope it helped GOOD LUCK!!!!!
vAUewI5faa	heres what to do:  connect ur shuffle to the computer, open up itunes, and then click on ur shuffle. it should show a picture of ur ipod and how much space is left, etc. near the middle of the screen there is an option called "Restore" which will erase all of ur songs but fix the problem. its the only way (hopefully u put in the songs in ur itunes library.)|`|6a55ffafe30a288e463a44590fbd060daa	Okay...it sounds like you've already gone crazy.

g2CYn27naa	how the hell do you expect to keep a low price when you are buying the top range stuff?  anyway you need at least 700watt if not more for PSU, as for the SSD, have a look at the review to get prices and best performing hdd. Also to lower the price, dont bother with amazon, they will not have the best prices avialible. try newegg.com for your components. Not only will you have more choice, but you should also get lower prices

IidCp0KDaa	360 degree's in a circle.    The power button on the Xbox is a circle, the guide button is also a circle.|`|uctxzjIIaa	MS's explaination was that, like there are 360 degrees in a full-circle, the second XBox system is a complete package.    Realisitcally, they more likely wanted the name of the system to have something at the end that featured a three at the beginning, due to fear that the public perception of "Ps3 vs XBox2" would make uninformed consumers think the XBox2 was a full generation behind.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	maybe it means that its perfect in every aspest or suitable for everyone. like the measurement 360 degrees on a full scale protractor.|`|IC0ELEmjaa	it's probably just a name  less original than Nintendo (Gamecube-Wii?), more original than Sony(1,2,3...)|`|XMXlXu0xaa	Because it sounds appealing so people would buy it.|`|hnXS1Nttaa	If you weren't tech savvy, which one would sound better? PlayStation 3 or Xbox 2. The choice in '360' was probably centred around the power button (a circle - i.e. 360 degree circle and the L.E.D. ring around it.) The Xbox 360 logo / Guide are also circles, hence 360.

It still bothered the hell out of me, after paying 300$ for it. Just take it back, and try going to another future shop, walmart, or best buy. Or try Costco, Idk if they have the new ones yet.  The middle button seems to be a bit faulty in general because my friend's ipod video middle button stopped working after a year. And she didn't do anything to it.  If it's already defective, you don't want to have to deal with it later.  Future shop doesnt care if you return it, they send it back to the manufacturer and get their money back. No big deal.|`|BJzhuAGWaa	ha. im in the same boat. i eventually couldnt handle it and replaced it for free b/c it was still under the warrantee. unfortunately, now my replacement has been damaged (severely) and i missed the warrantee by 8 days. i too am OCDing over this situation...X(|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	sell it and then buy another one|`|E59mK1FUaa	I don't really think it's a big deal.

chKSL0Ewaa	Alright, hopefully this may help you a little bit.   I have all my artwork exactly as if I had bought my music from iTunes on my iPod touch. For your Katy Perry Songs, try to fix the id3 tags so that they are exactly the same (except for the actual song name)...   So basically, plug in your iPod touch, click LIBRARY on the left hand panel... and then find the katy perry song, right click, and click CHANGE id3 tags... from here, make sure that these are the same on both your katy perry songs ... (ALBUM NAME, ARTIST NAME, and ALBUM ARTWORK) ... drag them into your iPod touch and hopefully it will work then... good luck!|`|xU9Qhczqaa	wait what i got totally confused with your question
krB6hWIeaa	Wait for the newer one.  Heard its coming out soon.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	Wait... It'll be worth it!
nXcr5kzpaa	Do not turn it on. Get a few of those gel packets that come in new purses then put the packets and the ipod in a ziploc bag for a few days. After a few days try turning it on.The gel packets are supposed to suck in the moisture. Good luck!|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Hello try drying it with a hairdryer but not to hot i hope it works out for you good look.|`|zbWZop0laa	Place your ipod near a heated place such as a heating vent if u live in a cold place. other wise place near ( not tooo near) dry heat. and wait till it the inside is all dried up and hope for the best.    If u have warranty try using it but i dont think they cover that
U9n960GYaa	Remove the battery and place the phone into a baggie with brown rice for a day or two.  The rice will absorb the moisture from the phone...|`|AA10124897	give it a day maybe two it should be alright... if it was only for second... depends on what quickly is to you..     also note, removing the battery does not "hard reset" the phone, that's a soft reset..|`|CNotcjbaaa	Take battery out and let it dry. You could use a low setting on blowdryer about 8 inches away maybe    or try changing your ringtones back to normal?|`|LExEl5k1aa	Maybe the usual, take out the battery and let it dry for about an hour, this also does a  hard reset on the unit. good luck.|`|dLULcTgcaa	Make sure your ringtone is set for text messages. If there's any water damage, I doubt it would have that kind of effect.|`|PRqCRJm3aa	nice going. lol      sit the speakers and every other part of the phone iin fornt of a hair dryer (turn it on) for 45 minutes striaght. it'll dry iy out...      i dropped mine in a toilet, the n i did this for 2 hours, and it still worked, then sit it under a lamp.
qGfAlDd2aa	The two countries are still using different systems.  Brazil is using SBTVD for digital and the US is using ATSC.  Sorry . . .
AA11579568	If you're still with AT&T and just change your phone, you aren't breaking the contract.  If you want to break the contract (I have no idea why you would) you need to contact Customer Service. The cost for early termination varies widely depending on company, specials when you signed up, and specific contract terms.|`|E8qMrpA7aa	umm i couldnt say. i would go to the at&t store sometime soon and tell them. hope that helped :) good luck :)
0i5dn4ryaa	Well the major problem you're going to have is finding a PSP that is modifiable.  You'll have to find a refurbished PSP 2000 that was released prior to January '08 (so anything released December 2007 and later).  If you can find a PSP fat I would def. go for that.  With that being said, since you don't want to play games I believe an iTouch would be much better.  As long as you have wifi access you can watch YouTube and buy applications or download free ones.  You won't have to go through the pain of converting and storing videos and music on the PSP as you can use iTunes for media purposes.  I don't know the availability of av cords and such for the iTouch but I know they're available for the PSP.  The PSP is mostly good for playing games as the internet browser is terrible.  From the looks of things if you're not really into games either newer or classic emulators then bypass the PSP.  If you really just want music and video then go for the iTouch.  Though this will cost you more, you won't have to deal with buying and swapping out memory cards when one is full.  The down side to the iTouch is that when it's full it's full and you'll have to delete or move files around when you want to put new ones on.|`|AA12146249	you would be alot happier with an Itouch a PSP is too bulky for what you are wanting .. I own a psp so I'm not just trying to be a jater.|`|ZYMjsGSJaa	I wouldn't buy a PSP 3000, I heard on gameinformer that the screen is realy bright that the you can see the pixels real easy, I would get the 2000 version. but when you get it dont upgrade, go to google and look up some emus for psp|`|kfZ66olcaa	If you're into to homebrew and a large variety in terms of ability, go with a PSP but try to find a 2000 series or even one of the phats(1000) series.    The PSP compared to the iTouch is just... More useable in my opinion.    Of course if you're looking mainly for music purposes, you can't go wrong with the iTouch.
dLULcTgcaa	Yeah you pretty much have to, but there's ways of "flashing" phones to other carriers.|`|CNotcjbaaa	It's possible.    Search on google.|`|33H19iQqaa	no. you have to use a phone that is for that company|`|LExEl5k1aa	you can purchase an "unlocked" phone and use it with almost any network, but beware of doing this.......|`|PRqCRJm3aa	same phone. same carrier.|`|OpqUaHtsaa	you gotta have a phone from the same company the majority of the time
8H9eSDm8aa	Get an xbox 360, and then get a Sony Ericson phone, it has 3g network, its got a great GPS program, a few games, a 3 mega pixel camera, and really cool buttons. Its an amazing phone, and I got it for 50 bucks with the rebate. Sidekicks really aren't worth the 300 bucks, they are kinda slow sometimes.|`|C7baXdSZaa	If you dont have a phone probibly the phone UNLESS most of your freinds have xbox then i would go with xbox becuase the xbox is fun to play and you can chat the whole time and text just like a phone. OR go with whatever is more expennsive first then save up for the cheaper one.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	get the 360. you can play games and go online with. but if you wanted a phone, get the 360 first and get a cheap phone with your own money (the phone). then when you get another chance, choose the phone|`|33H19iQqaa	if you don dont have a phone already, you should go for the sidekick. but if you have a phone, then get a 360 but playstation 3 is better.|`|IC0ELEmjaa	Xbox- how many phones can play Halo 3? besides, you don't really need an expensive phone, if you can just get a cheap prepaid phone, I see no reason to get a phone more than $50  and PS3 is a better system but it has worse games

AA12116276	Um, no.     You need to restore the Zune to factory settings before you sell it.     Answer from when this question has been previously asked:    Open the Zune program and connect the Zune. Click on device. Under Sync scroll down and tell it to erase all content.

a4b0e58e7fc3d933670b14375b88b2cdaa	APN stands for Access Point Name and it's a setting that you can adjust in your T-Mobile phone. The APN is the gateway address to the web. There are a few APNs for T-Mobile but the last one is the newest as of the end of last year. The APN might be different depending on what type of phone you have.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	First of all, avoid Bose.  There products are without exception overpriced.  You can get a good receiver, a good speaker set (with small satellites) and a good Blu-ray player all for under $1,000.  For example:    http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Hi-Def-Ho...    If you want to spend $2,000 you will have no problem.  This sort of stuff can be really expensive.  However, I'm a bit of a cheapskate, so I know very little about the higher end stuff.

BonyOJLRaa	I got my husband's 4GB  4th Generation IPod Nano from Amazon.com for about $150 for his birthday (shipping was free too!).

Ok ive got a zune and i love it.|`|jyfSyraaaa	An ipod nano 8GB|`|TaBsMJFBaa	Depends : )  If you want to play games and have a big budget, want a big screen for movies (and a big pocket I might ad) get a iPod touch.    If your very colorful, watch movies occasionally, smaller budget, don't mind a smaller screen and a smaller Device get a iPod Nano    If you want to fit your whole library and more, and you don't mind a thick device and for occasional movie playing it's alright.    If you just want to listen to music occasionaly and don't have a massive library, and for a $50 US its a good deal, Get a iPod shuffle|`|yb4HJgCpaa	get him a blue nanochromatic.|`|mb17ouvUaa	i suggest the nano (though you specifically say you don't want it) because you can get a case for it and it's much more reasonable in price than a touch (unless you want to spend a lot). i think you can even get a purple nano and i'd go to amazon.com to look for cases. they are cheaper there and more variety than most stores.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Black or red 8gb nano.|`|8E59Idahaa	get him one of those new coloured ones.... i think there shuffles... they have purple!  lol  sorry i have been no help =p|`|ucr4J8kcaa	How much are you willing to spend? The ipod touch is great because you can get on the internet, store files, and download applications, while the regular ipods simply hold music, videos, and photos. I love my iphone, so I'd say go for the ipod touch. If he has a lot of music, like me (I have about 40 gigs of music on my computer), he might want something bigger like an 80g or 120g video ipod. But if he doesn't have too much music an ipod touch is great. Not as small as the nano, but the same amount of space.    I'd let him buy his own cover, that way he can choose. Many stores (target, wal mart, amazon.com) sell covers for all the different ipods.|`|wcYRxDw2aa	Well I know that an I pod touch is pricy but an 8 gb is only $250 and best buy sell's cases of all colors and they even have holders.  Even for a nano they have cases that you can put on your belt or on your arm.|`|DAimMrGLaa	well it needs to be pink. that's for sure.|`|ev3EwV2laa	ipod touch but they are kind of expensive|`|HcjCdLehaa	Classics are the best. I have a nano.|`|6zXg6DRIaa	sounds like you answered your own question...nano is pretty much it, unless you want to get him a shuffle that doesnt have a screen|`|2kTIk3voaa	i touch|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	iPod touch, best thing you could ever get him|`|XQH72YZWaa	lols get him an ipod mini|`|jMGN4KU5aa	I have a red 4G Zune and it was about $20 cheaper than an iPod nano (with the same amount of gigs) when I bought it, probably even cheaper now. I'd go with a Zune. On their website you can even get cool custom artwork engraved on them!     http://www.zune.net/en-US/    If you don't like the artwork so much, this website has great covers for them, you can even make your own!    http://www.decalgirl.com/browse.cfm/2,25...|`|s3L88qGQaa	This is just in my opinion, but you shold get him a an older type, the nano, but the nano that can hold atleast 2k songs. heck, you might want to get him a gift card too, in some respects, songs aint free. Thank you|`|6a55ffafe30a288e463a44590fbd060daa	Touch is the best way to go, but its pricey. You could get classic, but that's too old. Zunes are cool too so check that out. But if you want what fits your description, just get a purple nanochromatic with a rubber skin, so it has friction and doesn't slip and slide! ;)
MpiE4f88aa	try to reset your ipod.  (hold down the menu and center button for a couple of minutes until the screen fades and you see the apple come up.)  also, have you tried to slide the hold button off?  or is the actual ipod stuck on hold?  good luck!|`|6a55ffafe30a288e463a44590fbd060daa	Well, why'd you do that? Huh?

8gi5gfOsaa	Not so long as the puncture did not penetrate the coils or condensers of the charging system. If it did, you will likely find your cooling capacity is a thing of the past. If the puncture just penetrated the walls into the insulation of the box, you need only find a way to close the puncture in order to retain the original efficiency of the unit. Aside from that concern, it will probably work indefinitely, should you care nothing about excess power consumption and all things GREEN.|`|LB9xWMIWaa	Depends on what punctured, if it's the compressor that's punctured, fridge is toast, the rest is just insulation, if there's no liquid seeping out of the puncture slap some duct tape on it and save yourself 500 bucks.

fwnqB0dTaa	There is no way for YOU to track the phone, no matter what other answerers have said.    Only law enforcement agencies can do that, and even then they will only do it if a crime has been reported relating to the phone (theft etc).    They won't put the resources needed into tracking down a lost phone.    Best thing for you to do is give the serial number etc to your service provider and they can block the phone being used by anyone.    Not much use to you, but at least you know no one else can use the phone.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	it depends on what phone company you have. call them and ask.|`|98dletRgaa	i agree with pretti gurl.what company do u have.|`|TYx3r3vuaa	if u lost it in ur house and it still has battery try calling it

Xxviy63Paa	Yes, I use my ps3 as a pc and it's a very valuable backup to my pc when it goes dead. It also is a better web browser than the XMB, and watches youtube better despite the recent youtube improvements sony made.    Get ubuntu here:    http://www.psubuntu.com    Latest good install is Hardy, it is a stable release and is recommended, though last I heard there were a few problems getting it to work... if there still are, use Gutsy instead.    I use my ps3 OtherOS partition partly to download and store video from youtube. I also use it to play quake2, and a few other games that work in ppc architecture. It's kind of a hobby, getting stuff to work on a non-x86 platform. The ps3's graphics hardware can't be used under linux, but the cell is so crazy powerful that it can run many games very well anyhow. It makes some aspects of Quake look better under software acceleration than it looks on my pc under opengl2.0.    I can also use my ps3 as a game server, if I need one for my LAN. And to rip music off of internet radio. And to transcode video files. I can do all these things with my pc too, but sometimes I use the ps3 just for the hell of it.    PS3 linux is greatly limited both by the lack of access to the gpu and the fast but scarce system RAM; meaning there's only about 218mb of RAM available. But it still runs a lot of stuff real good. And some stuff runs crazy fast, as long as there's not too much stuff running at once.    Last time my pc crashed, I was glad I had otherOS up and running. The ps3's native web browser sucks eggs, sorry Sony but it just does. They haven't even fixed the Java buttons after 2 years.|`|UGrZGjZnaa	its possible but i think its a waste of time -_-|`|SZkSRBRLaa	Take your PS3 to a good engineering college and pay one of the guys there to fix it up :).|`|1ykhOBLuaa	so y dont u play games on pc instead??????|`|ggKeBL7Laa	Yes of course it is possible,, But my Fav platform is PC...

DDQwdurBaa	Do it. LCD TVs, especially a Samsung one, aren't going to get any better (and cheaper). I have one back home and it's beautiful. Just be sure you can actually fit the thing in your dorm in the first place, since the desks don't compare much to its size.|`|RyvKws7Laa	Its technology, there will ALWAYS be a newer, "better", model out next year.  That's the nature of technology.  You should buy when you need/want, not when you think you're getting THE item that will never get bettered.    LCDs are going to a new level of quality with LED backlight LCDs.  But right now those are like $6,000.  Its not going to be next year when those prices bottom out.  The next generation of TVs will be OLEDs.  But right now I think an 11" one (yes only 11") is like $2,500.  So again, its more than a little while before those really hit the consume market in full swing.    I personally recommend Plasma over LCD, but if you go LCD, Samsung is definitely a good choice to make.  Make sure you look out for the contrast ratio (real contrast ratio, not the dynamic contrast ratio which is a lie).  The bigger the better.  And at 46" it will start becoming noticeable.  Also go for 1080p and 120Hz refresh for 46" and LCD.  120Hz is a must for sports on LCD. (Plasma is better for fast action - sports/action movies).    Why Plasma:    LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|sER6UGMWaa	i would tell you to wait due to the fact that there about to come out with new models and there is also new technology coming out as well|`|wS9UNPWwaa	I think it would be best if you bought it, i mean really, why would you have to wait another year.  you will make the money back, it will all be good.  i think these can be pretty discounted sometimes.|`|HoOHNKKnaa	Yeah get it for this Superbowl..

UcsBgfntaa	Your problem is that you bought an LG phone. Do not ever by LG, I am suprized people wouldn't get it after everyone in the world had to return their chocolates.
AA10326440	Since you have had the phone for less than a year it is still covered by the manufacturers 1 year warranty so take the phone back to Verizon explain the problem and have them give you a new phone.  My daughter had a different problem with her LG enV2 and got it exchanged for a new one with no problem.  Her friend had the same problem as her and is on her 4th or 5th phone replacement but her problem is self-inflicted.    Like I said, it's less than a  year so tell them to replace the phone with a new one. Do this at your nearest Verizon store.  If they do not do anything then go to http://www.lg-usa.com, click on the customer service link for cell phones and call (do not email as it goes into a black hole never to be answered) the LG customer service department, explain the problem, they will give you an RA number (return authorization) and they will either fix or replace the phone.  If they don't ask, then you need to ask if they have a loaner phone for you.  They offered a loaner phone for an LG Chocolate that we had problems with.    Good luck!|`|c6PRMsW4aa	um my sister has had it for a year plus the othe 200 people who have one in are school and i am not liying that all u see is the enz 2 and every one has had no problmes so its your phone so try spening the battery and if it spends then that meant it has had water dam and also means time for a new phone
VbAm6N59aa	You will probably pick up channels in areas farther away as digital has a stronger and more reaching signal. Also, some stations actually broadcast more than one channel. I work for a PBS station and we have 9 channels but they can't be picked up with analog. My grandparents went nuts when they plugged in their converter and saw them all.

Have fun'!|`|ui3hwihuaa	You are not stupid...just beginning. This time next week you will be answering all these questions by yourself.  The answer is "Windows Live Photo Gallery", where you will find all your lovely pics taken either from your Memory card or if you cable it up, from the camera direct.
VUK77SrXaa	The newer TIVO's (and DVD-R units) have copy protection schemes built in. This may prevent you from burning the movie from premium channels. There are ways around this, but it involves some "hacking" equipment that is not cheap (usually between $75 and $150).    New copy protection - url http://www.dvdrw.com/press/broadcastflag...

2VqlXSE0aa	i've found tons of sites. i dont hav links cuz i googled it. google it and u'l probably find it.    if you're looking to buy japanese phones, there are tons of forums with people dealing these phones. i believe its easy to find someone that's trustworthy because they've been doing this forever.    but if wehreever ur living locally has asian stores, i bet they'll have some.    but if you don't live in japan, then a japanese phone would really be useless other than looks. none of their renown high tech features such as one-seg tv, their internet, etc, work. my friend has one and it's quite useless. i would recommend getting a local phone that works with your services and operators    sorry that i couldn't provide links.    good luck though
BOMu89Ttaa	Walk over to the cage and then a picture will pop up to show you what controller to move; as for the nunchunk or wiimote. Then when you see the picture hurry up and move it when you see it pop up, otherwise you wouldn't climb
ESA5ZDfnaa	I would not recommend waiting for the battery to run out.  If your iPod is the kind with a click wheel, you may be trying to reset it using the wrong buttons.  All iPods with a click wheel should be reset by toggling hold on and off then pressing the center and menu buttons, not the play button.  Something that they don't tell you to do which may also help is resetting while it is plugged into the computer.  Hope this helps.|`|7om1xYCzaa	alls you have to do is hold the center button and the menu button down at the same time the ipod will reboot itself i promise i did that to my ipod many times. just hole them down till it resets itself it wont do anything to your music or anything|`|dYdLmOHyaa	the same thing happened to my nano last week and ya, i just waited for the battery to run out. then when i plugged it back into my computer it worked again
ij9N9r5waa	Yea I spend a lot of TV time on Y/A instead.
VsmqrHoqaa	it charges from the computer when its plugged in, so yes, it is. you can buy separate chargers to plug into outlets, but its not nessecary.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	no the usb charges too|`|AA10174516	it charges from the computer when its plugged in, so yes, it is. you can buy separate chargers to plug into outlets, but its not nessecary.
RyvKws7Laa	You can't really see 1080p advantages on sets 40" or smaller.  So if you're going that small 720p is fine (unless you want to sit with your nose next to the TV).  Paying extra for 1080p with a medium/small tv is a waste of your money.    If you are going 42" or bigger than you should consider 1080p models.  You start to notice it in around there.  Maybe as you'll be in the bedroom you could go as low as 37" (since you will be fairly close to the TV in theory).  But that's kind of pushing the barrier of where you'd notice the difference.    ====    If you had two TVs of the same size, and they were both small sets, and compared 720p vs 1080p you wouldn't notice the difference unless you stuck your nose to the screen.  If the TV isn't big enough, you're not going to see the difference.  Even though 1080p may be technically better, you won't see it unless you have a big TV.
Ga9oCLavaa	I recommend the 18-200mm lens; it's worth the extra money and you'll get the extra zoom you need.    But you'll find a better deal here    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/59...      I got my D80 from there and was extremely satisfied with the packaging and shipping speed.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I think it worth to buy second choice better lens with accessories.
AFzb8sXCaa	All of the coupon type converters have to have certain features. But some converters are definitely "better" than others.     What constitutes "better" depends on what you are going to use the converter for. For example:    If you get marginal TV signals now, you probably want one with a superior tuner.     If it's going to be used by the technically challenged (elderly, children, etc) you probably want one with a simple remote control.    If you are going to use it with a VCR, you probably want one with a "VCR timer".    Here is my list based on extensive research:  -------------------------------  Best converter unless you have a special need:  Zenith DTT901 (or its clone, the Insignia NS-DXA1-APT at Best Buy)    -Remote can turn TV off & on, but sound is controlled at the converter output.  --------------------------------------...  If you need something with a simple remote control. (simple box for elderly or non-tech people):  RCA DTA 800B1 or DTA 809    -Remote can control TV on/off & volume, a big plus  -Has smart antenna support  --------------------------------------...  If you want S-video to get a bit more picture quality:  Channel Master CM-7000  --------------------------------------...  If you are using it with a VCR or analog recorder without an IR blaster (has timer to switch channels):  Zinwell ZAT-970A  --------------------------------------...  Best converter for use with 12 Volt power :  Artec T3AP-Pro  --------------------------------------...  Cheapest box:  DISH Network TR-40CRA    -The newest software for it seems to have fixed most of the quirks in the earlier production  -Can be used with VCR (has timer to switch channels).
oJJmJTuaaa	Get the XBOX 360 Pro because you want to download stuff.|`|lIMjCaS1aa	Xbox 360 Pro: $399.00.|`|tD3JPC1Jaa	ok... the xbox arcade is not much different form the xbox pro only the arcade is cheaper and has less memory. if you do alot of saving (i play alot of sports games and i do many dynasties and those take memory! haha) so if i were you i would spend just a bit more for the xbox pro it will be worth the memory thats what i have... if you get online at all that takes memory too...  but for your case do not buy the xbox elite!  way to much money and its really not much better at all|`|Cogcypiraa	i would say get the xbox 306 pro     1. its not too much  2,it has enough memory for at least 10 games and more memory if u are planning on buying another game  3.it has online    over all the best game box u should get is the ps3 from my own experiences with the xbox 360(i own one myself its a pro)if u play a game for 1 week or maybe more and not play your other games until you want to the other games might not work on the xbox 360 happened to most people and you might have to buy a new one or fix it or return it if u can

BOMu89Ttaa	For the Wireless internet connection    You would need a router to connect to the internet: which you can buy at electronic stores.  Ask one of the employees for help.    Then you'll have internet access.    Then on your Wii, go to your settings and look for internet.  Go to test settings: Look for your internet access point. Get it up.    To get the internet channel:    Go to the wii shop channel, go to channels and the internet is 500 wii points: You can buy Wii points online by: going to Wii points on the screen and order them with a credit card. 1000 = $10, 2000 = $20...And so on, or buy them at Gamestop for Example: but it's called a Wii point card, some are either 2000 which is $20 or 4000 which is 4000...Type in the code in the Wii. Then you'll get your points and buy the internet channel which will be on your main menu    Since if have a router which connects to access points to the internet you can play wifi games like for example: Mario Kart Wii.|`|3e65dfb46f6689bcdc2d5c7ab71084ebaa	the exact steps can be located on Wii.com. here's a summary you would need a wireless router.
