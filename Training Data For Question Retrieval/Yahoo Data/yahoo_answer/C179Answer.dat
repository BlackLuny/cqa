You have a 50/50 chance of having a girl and whatever you have, I'm sure that you will love it no matter what. Good luck.|`|44d983e549bff0d4e51b0b2593c25999aa	Your choice of having a gurl is great you doin this is fashion these anywayz if you wanna have a gurl plz plz leave it on god if u have trust in him and pray and by this you will know also that he listen to or no ..|`|a9e255e064ae5d8a7db93d811096a850aa	hey. I think that choosing the sex of your baby is fine as long as you try to do it naturally,like the Salinas method. In witch you time the intercourse accordingly. I don't think there should be scientific intervention. I think you should go for it. It will contribute positively to your life and won't effect the child. Just be sure you won't harbor any hatred against the child if it comes out a boy. Its YOUR life and if a beautiful baby girl will make you happy go ahead and do it. Good luck.|`|b74dfb6f55186377a5a2d3b39d8d6db9aa	they say the best way to have a irl is to not orgasum. because when you do it kills off the girl sperms but its not 100% its who wins the race realy. good luck|`|l0rbJQtxaa	NO, I would never try to influence the sex of my baby. I would accept whatever god gave me as a blessing and just be blessed that I have a healthy baby.|`|AA11787590	yes i would want to influence the sex of my next baby. i have three girls and want a boy. my dr says its gods choice but i really want a boy. We are going to try the shettles method. if you did get pregnant this time it could be a girl theres always a 50-50 chance of having either or. good luck.|`|d8cddd77a64ecf734a055d9f313b6248aa	I would choose if I could! I would even do that sperm sorting thing they do if I could afford it.... I already have a son and a stepson, so I really want a girl... I am currently pregnant, and got pregnant the first month trying. I didn't expect it to be that soon, and I was going to look up some ways to make a girl, but I was already pregnant lol... I don't know what the sex is, (shy baby) but I think it is a girl.... <br>  There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying for a boy or girl.. Some people say it is playing god, but I don't. It is not like you are genetically changing it, your just rooting for a certain team lol... Good Luck I hope it works for you!

P2PtFiZtaa	Si tenes ciclos regulares, tu dia fertil es el dia 14 del ciclo. <br>  El dia 1 es el dia que comenzas a menstruar asi hayas empezado a menstruar a las 23.55hs. Ese es tu dia 1.<br>  Desde ese dia contas 14, al dia 14 le restas 4 y le sumas 4 (son en total 6 dias).<br>  Por ejemplo. Empezas a menstruar el dia 10/7. Tu dia 14 sera el dia 23 de julio.<br>  Al 23 de julio le restas 4 (desde el 20) y le sumas 4 dias (hasta el 26) podes quedar embarazada.<br>  Tu periodo fertil es entonces desde el 20 al 26 de julio (si tenes ciclos regulares de 28 dias) sino este metodo no es para ti. <br>  Muchos a?os use este metodo, con control de mi ginecologa, porque tengo contraindicado cualquier otro y nunca quede embarazada.<br>  Siempre tuve la precaucion de agregar un dia mas antes y uno mas despues. Me cuidaria desde el 19 hasta el 27. Total 8 dias.<br>  Podes tener sexo igual, utilizando el condon bien colocado, para que no se rompa (tienen instructivo) y me fue bien.<br>  Se llama metodo del ritmo. <br>  Si queres asegurarte podes hacer una consulta con una ginecologa especialista en atencion de adolescentes las hay muy buenas en hospitales publicos en Argentina (no se de donde sos, supongo sos adolescente) ellas te aconsejan que es lo mejor para ti, y en estos lugares te dan los condones ademas de pastillas o colocan Dispositivo Intrauterino DIU en forma gratuita y con absoluta reserva.<br>  Trabajo en un lugar asi, en un consultorio de esas caracteristicas. <br>  En la pagina del Ministerio de Salud de la Nacion te dicen hospital por hospital en cual tenes servicio de atencion de adolescentes y quienes son los profesionales a cargo de los mismos.<br>  Te deseo mucha suerte y cuidate.|`|tYeS2eAcaa	mira...Mientres uses condon..no importando si es antes o despues d tu mestruacion...las probabilidades de quedar embazarada son casi nulas...<br>  GRACIAS POR DISFRUTAR PERO CON RESPONSABILIDAD...<br>  y es menos probable despues de tu menstruacion|`|ef7f0f636072189c2c27739d91d3ad21aa	Pues estas ovulando.

Pero atención!!! El día 15 en este caso, sería el día en el que el óvulo se implanta en el útero, pero 2 días antes se viene ya formando y está en viaje, y hasta dos días después aun estará vivo y fértil ese óvulo... <br>  O sea que SON CINCO LOS DIAS FERTILES, se entiende?<br>  Pasado este lapso de tiempo (siempre que seas regular) el óvulo caerá bajo los implacables efectos de la HORMONA PROGESTERONA. Si ese óvulo no fue fecundado pasará a degenerarse en algo que se llama "CUERPO AMARILLO o CUERPO LUTEO", o sea, se convertirá en una mucosa sanguinolenta que pasará a engrosar el endometrio (la membrana interna del útero) hasta que gracias al delicado mecanismo hormonal que poseemos las mujeres, ese cuerpo amarillo se convertirá en menstruación y lo eliminarás de tu cuerpo.  Cumplido esto, tu organismo se ocupará de revertir las cosas, y tu glándula HIPóFISIS (que es la glándula que gobierna al resto de las glándulas del cuerpo) dará la órden de comenzar nuevamente a producir ESTROGENOS (la hormona encargada de producir óvulos), cosa que tus ovarios harán, hasta el día 15 nuevamente en que la producción estrogénica haya dado sus frutos formando nuevamente otro OVULO FERTIL.  <br>  Para simplificar, SI ERES REGULAR  basta con que tengas en cuenta la fecha de tu última menstruación, y cuentes 12 días a partir del día que te vino. O sea: Si te vino un 30, hasta el día 12 del mes siguiente puedes hacerlo tranquila.  del 12 AL 17 cuidate mucho, y del 18 al 30 otra vez puedes estar tranquila!  Pero, como te dije antes, esto es así SIEMPRE Y CUANDO SEAS MUY REGULAR Y TE VENGA SIEMPRE CADA 28 O 30 DIAS!  OK?  <br>  Si no eres regular, más vale consulta con un ginecólogo a ver cual es el modo más seguro de cuidarte, para reforzar la dudosa seguridad de los preservativos.|`|9ING63GWaa	Para evitar el embarazo lo mejor es la ABSTINENCIA el sexo conlleva MUCHAAAA responsabilidad PIENSALO no te dejes llevar por algun impulso piensa siempre en las consecuencias que te puede traer un embarazo o peor aun una enfermedad.

Vean quien pueda tomar leche de un biberón lo más rápido. <br>  Preparación para este juego de baby shower: Antes del baby shower, compre un biberón de 4 oz. para cada invitado quien vaya a venir.

Lo que tienen que hacer es con los ojos vendados pasar encima de la embarazada caminando y abriendo las piernas, pero el truco está en que en cuando les venden los ojos, la embarazada se cambia por otra muchahca de su complexión que tenga una panza postiza y cuando las participantes pasen caminando abriendo las piernas por encima, la embarazada postiza se debe de mover de manera que crean que le pegaron en la pansa. Está muy divertido.<br>  También es bueno eso de ponerse nombres de artículos de bebe como pa?al, cunero, sonaja, etc., y nadie debe llamarse por su nombre real, sino por el nombre del artículo, de manera que quien se equivoque debe pagar cierta cantidad de dinero. Eso les ayudará a juntar un poquito de dinero para la nueva mamá.<br>  Otro truco es el del pa?al, compra un pa?al de adulto, y quien cruze la pierna en el baby, se tiene que poner el pa?al.<br>  Otro juego es que la madre le cambie el pa?al al nenuco con los ojos cerrados. Le ponen todos los artículos, pero amarren a las extremidades del nenuco unos hilos para que lo puedan mover y le cueste trabajo a la madre cambiarle el pa?al al bebé.|`|97c8392d5b334a5f00927976b037466daa	Buen Día!!!<br>  En esta pagina encontrarás una gran variedad de jeugos para baby shower, una lista de 50 jeugos, juegos imprimibles, tablas de loteria baby shower, todo listo para imprimir..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pkts-babyshower.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pkts-babyshower.com</a><br>  <br>  Espero sea de tu agrado!<br>  <br>  Saludos!!!|`|BNLCfDmEaa	Hola Lu, puedes ponerle pinzas para la ropa unas 3 o 5 en la blusa y cuando una cruce las piernas se le quita una, quien junte mas pinzas gana, o darle de comer una o otra con los ojos cerrados y con un gorro de bebe la comida podria ser un gerber, otro es darles jugo o agua en un biberon a varias chicas y la que termine primero gana, cambiar un mu?eco ponerle pa?al rop etc.<br>  <br>  suerte y felicidades por el futuro miembro de la familia|`|cs38Vcucaa	bueno se pueden hacer varios juegos, por ejemplo: con un papel de ba?o o no se como le dicen alla para que los invitados y el padre mida la pancita de la madre cada quien se le da  el papel y mira la panza y corta, cuando cada quien tenga su papel a mano entonces cada una (la futura mama va pasando) va poniendo el papel alrededor de la cintura para ver cual es el mas exacto y el que sea se le da un regalito de bb o cualquier cosa que se tenga destinado para eso, otro juego es que se tanga a mano unos biberones con jugo y se escoge al que quiera participar y se tendra que tomar el contenido en un tiempo de un minuto. y al que gane lo mismo del primero: su premio.<br>  otro juego es con un pampers se le ponen cuatro olores, pueden ser un perfume de bb, un poco de vinagre, un poco de cualquier olor o sustancia de cocina los que creas convenientes, que los olores no sean tan  fuertes que compitan entre si ni tan debiles que no se sientan. sera divertido ver como cada quien adivina y dicen disparates. se das a oler a cada invitado y este persivira y callara hasta que todos hayan olido. despues ya sabes.<br>  otro es decir cada quien los deseos para el bb y cuando todos hayan termindo llevarlo hasta otro cuarto y mostrarlo en un espejo (este tiene moraleja) o sea ejemplo: yo digo que el bb sera hermoso y cuando me lleven al otro cuarto me muestran dizque al bb pero en realidad lo que tienen es un espejo y me veo en el reflejo..<br>  espero que te sirva de algo por lo menos estos juegos.<br>  <br>  suerte.|`|BdDK0Nzyaa	Hola :<br>  Una buena Opción es  en un frasco de vidrio o de preferencia mamila, mete unos chocolates o dulces, múestralo a tus invitados y ellos deben escribir en un papel cuantos dulces hay, el mas aproximado  será el ganador|`|QytDhHFLaa	juego de medirle la pansa a la mama le <br>  compra lana o liston y  cada quien que corte lo que cree que es la medida correta no tiene que medir a la mama para calcular es pura mente y cada quien pasa midiendole la pansa a la futura madre y el que se acerque  ala medida gana .-<br>  otro seria  dale una a 3 persona una hoja de papel para que escriban layor cantidad de nombres ya  sea de varon o hembra y gana el que tiene mas escritos pero no repetidos<br>  <br>  la de la cola del burro<br>  <br>  la de formar nomdres con romm′pe cabezas

It could also be just an abnormal period coming on. Either way good luck!
BykL0txuaa	What's AF?  Sorry if I sound ignorant, I never heard of that abbreviation before.<br>  <br>  As for the prenancy, you have all the symptoms, but it could be caused by many other things.  Stress, fatigue, overworked, hormonal imbalance, and/or believing you're pregnant can delay your period from coming as it should.  I used to skip mine for a while for 3 or 4 months.  Thought for sure I was pregnant, but I wasn't........then.  My periods were always weird and irregular, so it always got tricky figuring out if I was pregnant or not.  <br>  <br>  Go to the docs for a sure test.

UOGkW35daa	Es un proceso que empieza unos meses antes de comenzar en la escuela.Ante todo debes crear un nivel de comunicación e integración social en tu ni?o.Eso lo puedes lograr llevandolo a los parques para que juegue con ni?os no conocidos de el ,y hacer que interactuen entre ellos sin que ellos noten que tu los vigilas. <br>  Debes implicarlo en la compra de los utencilios para la escuela como la mochila(muy importante en la vida de un ni?o), los lapices y las libretas.Esa acción le crea sentimientos de responsabilidad y autoestima.<br>  Unos días previos al comienzo real de la escuela debes ir creando las condiciones para que el sepa que la escuela ademas de ser buena es algo serío e importante en su vida,como empezar a cumplir el horario de dormir y el de la siesta.<br>  La habitación del neno llega ha ser muy importante en su vida y es por ello que debes crear en ella un lugar para sus estudios y hacerle saber dias antes o un tiempo antes que es ahí en donde le dedicará algun tiempo no tedíoso a sus estudios.<br>  Nunca utilice a los estudios ni a la escuela como un medio de coexión; a la larga le hara rechazo a la escuela.Cuando lo deje en la escuela hagale saber que usted estará bien serca para ayudarlo aunque sea una mentira piadosa. Al finalizar las clases preguntele sobre como lo pasó,sus nuevos amiguitos y si puede le compra uno de sus dulces preferidos como satisfacción (no confundir satisfacción con premio).Digale que el proximo día será aun mejor.|`|072f26a3181fcfd2e9b4a9f72d3ea20baa	Que va llorar seguro, dejar a mami es muy duro para el ni?o, pero no te preocupes cuando entre en su clase y ya no te vea se tranquilizará y se lo pasará muy bien, con los otros ni?os y las profesoras saben que hacer para consolarlos, lo más seguro que lo pasarás peor tu que no tu hijo. Explicale que en el cole tendra amiguitos, que jugaran mucho que pintaran y aprendara muchas cosas. Ya verás que cuando lo vayas a recoger será todo lo contrario y el dia siguiente irá mejor. Todas hemos pasado por esto, crecen demasiado rápido. Mucha suerte y no llores mucho.|`|0NRN9gcTaa	Todo depende de la institución y maestro que reciba al ni?o . Creo que sería conveniente recibirlos con una reunión infantil , puesto que esto les encanta. Además  que con anterioridad se le haya comprado  útiles escolares  para que llegado el momento ya estén familiarizados con ellos.|`|1nxamhzsaa	Como profesora de Primaria creo que lo que puedes hacer es contarle que el colegio es "mundo fantástico y maravilloso".

Mi sugerencia es que la persona que lleve al ni?o al cole le transmita seguridad al ni?o, y hacerle entender que no lo abandonan contarles la verdad que hay que ir al trabajo, y que ellos van a pasarcelo muy bien transmitir toda la seguridad y confianza posible en los maestros y en el centro y dejarle claro que volverán a por él. Luego cuando salgas en el coche llora cuanto quieras si te apetece. un beso y mucha suerte.ánimo todos fuimos ni?os y pasamos por erso no es tan catastrófico|`|4tcju70Eaa	Es inevitable que lo pase "algo mal" los primeros días, sobre todo si no ha ido a la guarde, debido al sentimiento de abandono. él cree que tú no volverás, por lo tanto lo que tienes que transmitirle es mucha seguridad, hablale de lo bien que lo va a pasar en el cole y de las actividades que allí realizará, de todo lo que va a aprender y de los muchos amigos que le están esperando y también dile que volverás a por él. Despidete de él con un beso y siempre, aunque llore, una sonrisa para que  sepa que el lugar donde lo dejas es bueno. No alargues las despedidas. Procura que tú familia sigua estas instrucciones. Nunca le amenaces con "si no comes se lo diré a tu se?o", ni "verás como te castigan en el colegio". Hablale de la se?o y del papel que desempe?a. Dile que es como su mamá en el cole, ella lo va a cuidar, a dar agua, a contar cuentos...y que lo quiere mucho. Verás como la adaptación al centro es muy fácil y tú eres la mamá más contenta cuando veas la ilusión con la que tu peque va a la escuela. Te lo dice una se?o y una madre. Besos.|`|5699b2188331e38384983332526ab297aa	Hola:<br>  Como profesora de Infantil te podría indicar que fomentes todo lo positivo que se va a encontrar en el colegio (otros ni?os, experiencias nuevas, profesores, aprendizaje, juegos...) para que el ni?o no encuentre un mundo totalmente desconocido para él el primer día. Si el ni?o conoce lo que va a encontrarse y se lo vas explicando con toda naturalidad creo que le resultará menos chocante. Asimismo, enfatiza esa nueva de responsabilidad en su vida, un ni?o que ya "es mayor", puesto que va al colegio. Espero que estas breves sugerencias te sirvan para hacer del ambiente escolar un ambiente cómodo y familiar para él al que desee volver con alegría todos los días, puesto que ésa es la misión de nosotros los profesores también en el aula.<br>  Un saludo.|`|59ed3491b5753c658962db87f687fe1daa	Hola amiga te sugiero que le prepares antes contandole lo que se hace en el colegio desde juegos y cosas divertidas, se que es extra?o para el todo pero comprale el morral preferido un cuaderno que a ellos les gusta dibujar , que se los muestre a toda la familia,luego el gran dia llevenlo juntos los dos tanto mami y  a papi es dificil para el y para ustedes dejarlo el primer dia puede ser que no llore al momento pero si le van hacer muchas falta,trata de llegar a buscarlo mas temprano de lo normal y recompensalo ese primer dia con un juguete o llevalo a comerse algo que le guste, pero te sigiero que lo estimules mucho ese dia hazlo sentir mi bebe va al colegio y es un excelente ni?o y veras los resultados soy madre de 2 ni?os uno de 13 y una ni?a de 7 fue dificil pero esa fue mi tactica,y hoy en dia la quiero compartir espero tengas la misma suerte que yo,les deseo suerte.|`|6e504f9fffab8cd2b82bd957c756e916aa	Lo ideal en estos casos,,,es ir lo preparando con tiempo,,,para que se acostumbre a pasar  ratos con amiguitos,, y asi,, no sea traumatico,,para ellos ejemplo,,,,dejarlo en casa de familiares ,,solos  dos horas y luego subirlo,,hasta llegar a cuatro horas .....Yde vez en cuando darle una vuelta ,,para que se den cuenta que no lo estamos abandonando,,todo lo contrario,,hacerles ver que lo queremos mucho y que son muy omportantes para nosotros.... en la casa luego de estar,,periodos prolongados solos hacerles ver con  mimos y caricias que nos hacian tanta falta como nosotros a el...............|`|8f03e6d72afa7902d7d0cf1ba1be2e23aa	HOla, yo tengo un ni?o de cuatro a?os y para que el primer día de cole no fuera un melodrama antes de comenzar el curso lo iba dejando un cuarto de hora o una hora en estos parques de juegos que suele haber en los centros comerciales. No tuve problemas|`|9rnX9P3Oaa	Comienza hablando con el, aunque es aun peque?o ten por seguro que el te escucha, y toma muy en serio todas tus palabras.<br>  Ayudalo a tener confianza en si mismo y en el nuevo ambiente que lo rodeara, puedes ir con el a visitar el colegio y a mostrarle cual es el camino y la distancia entre la casa y el colegio, eso lo hara sentir mas ubicado y menos perdido.<br>  Llorar el primer dia de clase no es malo, es una reaccion natural en un peque?o, asi que no le critiques ni lo censures si quiere llorar, solo dile que no es necesario, que mas bien se alegre muchisimo porque conocera nuevos amigos, nuevos juguetes, nuevos colores y nuevos cuadernos para pintar.<br>  Si es posible conozcan a la persona que sera su maestra, con mucha anticipacion y lleva a tu hijito a ver a la maestra unas dos o tres veces mas antes de que empiece el colegio, claro si es posible, si no es posible, llevalo a pasear por el colegio y muestrale los jardines y alrededores para que no tenga ningun temor.<br>  Y recuerda una vez mas, el podra llorar cuando ve que te vas, pero una vez dentro del salon se le pasara, todo esto es parte del proceso de madurez emocional y social por el cual todos los ni?os pasan.|`|ALl4jsCtaa	Creo que es una etapa muy dificil tanto para el ni?o como para los padres, pero es algo que cada ni?o debe pasar.<br>   Solo te puedo decir que trates de hablar con el  en un lenguaje de acuerdo a su edas y decirle que va a conocer amiguitos, que va a jugar mucho, que la escuela es su 2da casa. <br>  Talvez eso pueda ayudar un poco.|`|DA0pNhhtaa	Bueno,también me preocupaba cuando mi hijo iba a empezar el colegio, ya que además él nunca había ido a guardería ni se había separado de mí para nada. Yo lo que hice fué explicarle más o menos lo que iba a pasar, lo que iba a hacer, que se iba a quedar un tiempo allí pero que yo luego volvería, y la verdad que no me fué mal, tambien tuve la suerte que le tocó en la misma clase con una amiguita que se conocian desde peque?os y eso le ayudó, pero en fin la mayoria de los ni?os lloran los primeros días, las madres sufrimos y no hay mucho más que hacer,<br>  suerte|`|EkXICQssaa	pues consiguele amigos del colegio y dile que es por su bien y si saca buenas notas sera un gran presidente o algo asi <br>  ?tu diras?|`|ErVY01bUaa	Después de ver la situación muchas veces, y tal como muchas recomiendan: no seas tú el problema. En muchas de las ocasiones el problema son las mamás. Deberíamos desdramatizar, quitar tontería, estar tranquilas y transmitir confianza y seguridad. Tienen (y deben tener) vida propia.|`|G0brFH53aa	Hola, yo trabajo en un colegio y estoy con los ni?os peque?os, todos los cursos vemos el mismo panorama, los de 3 a?os que empiezan el cole, lo mejor es que no se le de importancia, muchos padres lo pasan peor que los ni?os y así se les contagia ese miedo, no es para tanto, en un mes todo el mundo está adaptado, y es muy distinto de puertas a dentro, en cuanto se van los padres los ni?os cambian la cara y se distraen con cualquier cosa, no hay que exagerar tanto con la vuelta al cole, hoy en día los colegios no son lugares de tortura, no hay que ponerse así, se les trata muy bien a los ni?os, no hay por qué tener miedo, cada vez mimamos más a los ni?os, y yo también estoy de acuerdo con que la despedida sea lo más corta posible, si no es muy peor para ellos.|`|J7bc6h4Raa	yo creo que tienes que hacer practicas  comentarle de adonde va ha ir ect...yo ten go 4 ni?os todos son mayores menos uno que acaba de empezar la guarderia adios si necesita algo llamame|`|N8lHGhhoaa	Como esta peque?ito lo que deberías hacer es ir lo acostumbrando a estar sin tí cierto tiempo para que la separación no sea traumática, también llevarlo al parque, o a otros sitios donde se encuentre con ni?os de su misma edad y que aprenda a compartir y jugar con ellos. Así el no sufre y tú tampoco.|`|gFVLsH0Paa	Hola, lo importante es que te vea tranquila, y hablarle de ello pero no machacarle, decirle que va a estar en un sitio nuevo con muchos juguetes, muchos ni?os, con una profesora que le va a cuidar y que va a aprender muchas cosas divertidas, tampoco se tiene que repetir muchas veces esta idea, solo hasta ver que lo entiende porque se le puede crear mucha expectativa y este hecho es lo que le pone nervioso a los ni?os. Cuanta mas naturalidad por parte de todos mejor. Un saludo y ?suerte!|`|OBETd8x2aa	Lo más importante es que los papis estén tranquilos y mentalizarle de que va a ser genial, que va a jugar con nuevos ni?os y que se lo va a pasar muy bien. El contacto previo con el entorno es muy importante, por eso es aconsejable llevarle antes y si puede conocer a la profesora, mejor. Mi hijo empieza este lunes y está acostumbrado a la guarde desde que nació practicamente, así que espero que acepte la situación como es y sea feliz.|`|iZ6xkdidaa	tranquila los mejor para los ni?os es estar entre ni?os, ademàs se lo pasan genial, sufrimos mas nosotras que ellos.<br>  Suerte.|`|Owee6BAUaa	Eso es muy normal que llore los primeros días,pues esos cambios traen consigo ese tipo de reacciones,trata de  no concentirlo ni despedirte tan efusivamente de él, esos es los primeros días,porque aveces no es solo él ni?o,sino que las madres terminan llorando,si el llora y enseguida te lo llevas a casa de vuelta va a utilizar el llanto como un arma o excusa para q lo lleves de vuelta a casa y ahí si que se te pone dificil,recuerda que es un período de adaptación.Si llora no te preocupes eso le pasa pronto.|`|Qoc4878oaa	Pues le costara pero tiene que acostumbrarse a ello, sino puedes darle un par de cachetes.|`|R7ZYGF1iaa	Entrar al cole es ingresar a un mundo diferente, con otra cultura, con gente nueva. Para él es como viajar a otro país, y quedarse solo en él. Es normal que sea difícil para los ni?os, y para las mamás también. Por eso trata de preparar el momento con anticipación, lo mejor es que puedas estar con él en el cole hasta que él se sienta seguro.  Entra a su salón, conversa con la profesora, que él vea que son amigas. Haz todo aquello que haga que él sienta que ese es un lugar confiable. Puede llevar un juguetito de su casa. O algo tuyo que a él le guste.<br>  Es muy importante la acogida que le de su maestra. <br>  Los cambios pueden ser difíciles pero si se hacen con amor, con paciencia, pensando en él que es el más peque?o, la situación será mejor.|`|n6AH1hbraa	Hola, tengo un hijo de 6 anhos y entiendo como te sientes, pero lo mas importante para tu hijo es que vea en ti la seguridad que el necesita. Tienes que quitarle hierro al asunto y decorar su nueva aventura al cole. No le hables del cole como un deber, hablale solo de las fantasticas consecuencias que ello conlleba. Como por ejemplo lo mucho que va aprender, todos los amiguitos que va a tener y lo divertido que lo va a pasar. La mayoria de veces somos los padres los que tenemos mas miedo que ellos. Ellos solo sufren el desenganche de las mamas y los papas pero cuando ya estan metidos en el meollo tienen muchos mas recursos que nosotros para adaptarse a esa nueva situacion.    Al fin y al cabo este es solo el primer bache importante por los que debera pasar tu hijo a lo largo de su vida. Ayudale manteniendote en tu posicion de adulta y no dejes que te rompa el corazon su sufrimiento. Almenos delante de el. Y sobretodo, deja que llore y comprendele, solo consuelale y deja que llore. Lo triste de los adultos es que muchas veces no nos atrebemos a llorar cuando lo pasamos mal, por eso cuando vemos a alguien llorar sentimos pena. Llorar es la forma  mas sana de expresion (no mas de 5 minutos porque entonces se convierte en victimismo). Cuando lloramos descargamos toda la rabia, luego uno se calma y se siente mejor. Yo siempre le digo a mi hijo "llora carinho, llora que ha dolido" en breve lo calmo y le sonrio... De esta manera tambien les ayudas a desarrollar sus sentimientos.|`|TsM6tSZVaa	dile k lo ba a pasar bien va a tener muchos amigos y los profes k jugaran con ellos debes en cuando<br>  eso es lo k hiso mi madre con migo jeje|`|qejfodCNaa	bueno mi opnion de tu hijo es que no lo consientas tanto para que empieze este mas animado y no le de miedo ir a otro mundo con nuevas personas. lo puedes preparar desde tu casa ense?andole `para donde va ir que conocera quien va estar etc. <br>  ojala que tomes en cuenta mi consejo chaito|`|VQ9VGGXeaa	oye...quien nolloro u primer di de clases?...es parte de la vida...dejalo...yo que tu..y en serio...mi mama a dejado a 5 primeras clases...XD....preparate para qu no llores y sufras tu...;)|`|xDyjsPSqaa	Bueno cuando yo fui por primera vez al cole no lloré y veía a much@s compa?erit@s llorar, el verlos llorar fue lo que me puso un poco asustada pero me adapté rápidamente; lo raro es que mis 2 hermanas mayores al igual que mi hermano menor si lloraron yo me senté y solo miraba alrededor, pienso que también depende de el caracter de cada uno, deberías decirle que no tenga miedo que va a ser divertido, contarle de las cosas buenas que va a ver, los jueguitos que existen, llévalo cerca del cole para que vea como pasan los ni?os que ya están ahí, incluso puedes jugar con psicología dile que si no le gusta los primeros días entonces no lo vas a enviar de nuevo, ofrécele algo a cambio como que si está ahí la primera semana le compras su helado favorito, entonces el ya se adaptará en las primeras semanas; pienso que también la sobreprotección es lo que los hace tener miedo. Te deseo suerte......|`|ZEYAUry6aa	lo mejor es ir uno mismo relajado y contentos una vez que el ni?o se queda y empieza a llorar tienes que explicar la verdad que tiene que quedarse allí unas horas y  después lo vendrás a buscar. si sigue llorando es mejor que te vayas ya parara por si mismo. es un poco duro pero necesario, los ni?os son muy listos y se dan de cuenta de todo, incluso hasta donde pueden jugar con tus sentimientos, uno se tiene que mantear firme. ahora un secreto para que un ni?o no llore no lo hay porque cada ni?o es un mundo  y reaccione de diferentes maneras.|`|a12a84630255a8d2fd5341352cae3a75aa	Convencerlo de las cosas buenas que tiene el cole.Como que vera a sus amigos,ira a alguna excursión,se lo pasara muy bien...|`|dhyWBN84aa	Bueno los primeros días de colegio para un nmi?o siempre son dificiles pero esa dificultad depende de el tipo de ni?o por ke si tu hijo esta acostumbrado a tratarse con ni?os de su edad no le va afectar mucho por eso es bueno ense?arlo a compartir con ni?os de su edad,ense?arlo a entrar en la sociedad por mas duro ke esto sea.Por eso tiene ke acostumbrarse a ese ambiente.Si le es muy dificile es mejor días antes de la esperada entrada la colegio xd xd hacerlo entrar en ambiente ke charle y se komunike con ni?os de su edad.|`|aI3IOB9Faa	Tendrás que hablarle de lo bien que lo va a pasar y que encontrará nuevos amigos; pero sobre todo aprovecha de dejarlo en casa de algún familiar o amiga de confianza que tenga ni?os por las horas que duraría en el colegio.|`|brOVqneJaa	En primer lugar comentarte que este es un momento muy importante para tu hijo y para tí, y como tal lo debéis abordar, pero eso sí, sin dramatizar. Los ni?os son muy inteligentes y captan nuestras tensiones, por eso es muy importante que te vea tranquila, que comprenda que es una nueva etapa que va a comenzar en la que va a descubrir un mundo muy rico de relaciones sociales y de estímulos. Actualmente en todos los colegios de E. Infantil tienen un período de adaptación en que se trabaja la integración de los alumnos/as al colegio, este período pretende que el ni?o/a se adapte al nuevo espacio en el que va a pasar una parte importante de la jornada, así como a su profesor/a y a sus nuevos compa?eros/as. El hecho de que llore en el momento de separación de los padres es muy normal, por lo que no debe preocuparte, pero la experiencia como profesional de la ense?anza me ha demostrado que el alargar las despedidas es negativo, es decir llevar al ni?o al cole, darle un besito e irte lo antes posible para no alargar ese momento. no utilizar chantajes y potenciar las nuevas experiencias enriquecedoras que comienza a vivir.<br>  Deseo haberte sido útil.|`|d5DDd6Wpaa	Hola mira dile esto: todos los ninos son inteligentes y solo hablale directo y dile q ahora es grande y necesita estudiar y hacer un ni?o que en el futuro ba hacer un profesional asi el pude asistir a escuela y tambien que el ya se tiene qeu aconstumbrar. y mira pra que el bbno pase mal el dia lo que tienes que hacer que tu la bayas a dejar y te estes entreteniendolo un rato o un retito si es que tu tienes tiempo ok EL NI?O SE QUE BA HACER UN PROFESINAL EN EL FUTURO Y QUE  ESTUDIE MUCHO OK CUIDATE .......|`|d6b7d12b583b9eb5fece7a8b523e38e2aa	Yo hice lo mismo con mis dos hijos y fue todo perfecto. Tambien juega a favor algo de suerte.<br>  Desde unos dias antes mencionaba el ir al colegio como un premio, pues todo son juegos y diversion.<br>  Es mas, cuando se portaban mal insinuaba que igual se quedaban sin poder ir al cole.<br>  Para un ni?o conocer algo nuevo es genial, somos nosotros los que sin querer les ense?amos a..que pena que nos separamos, no te preocupes que no te va a pasar nada,...etc..<br>  Hazlo natural, que te vea segura de lo bien que se lo va a pasar.|`|dLR5bG4yaa	Te diria que te prepares vos primero.

Dicho esto, te deseo mucha suerte: el primer día de cole con esa edad parece un melodrama de telenovela. Vete preparada con pa?uelos para soberte tú también los lagrimones: tu peque se hace grande :)|`|g6GsDWRsaa	?Buenas! Si ya lo has llevado a una guardería y disfrutó recuerdale cómo fue y que en el cole será igual y podrá hacer amigos nuevos y divertidos, que va a jugar y a pintar mucho, que la profesora es majísima,... Si no te has separado mucho de él, no le han cuidado otras personas algún día, puede que le cueste más, pero si te ve tranquila y segura él también lo estará. Hazle partícipe de los preparativos: comprar los materiales, el baby,... que sepa que luego os veréis y que va a ser divertido. <br>  No tiene porqué llorar, no al principio, y las maestras saben cómo hacer, les ocurre mucho estos casos. Pídeles ayuda si lo necesitas. Muchas veces que la conozcan antes del primer día les ayuda. Hay guarderías que hacen el proceso de separación paulatinamente para que padres e hijos lo lleven mejor. A veces los padres lo llevan mucho peor que los hijos. <br>  Espero que te sirva de ayuda. También hay páginas en internet que te cuentan estrategias, pero lo importante es no mentir, que participen, que sepan que no es eterno y les queréis estén donde estén.|`|ZQq6sooWaa	Mi experiencia han sido de tres hijos y te diré que hasta en el ultimo seguí pasándolo mal ,mi consejo es que te mentalices tu y procures no pasarlo muy mal porque el ni?o tardada mas o menos pero al final se adaptara con los demás ni?os y a la vez se inmuniza porque que sepas que te cogerá todos los catarros pero de esto también poco apoco se acostumbrara.Suerte|`|jnffSkQaaa	Tiempo antes dile lo que sucede, cómo es el kindergarden y todo, para que se vaya acostumbrando...<br>  <br>  Alégrense amigos, ya tenemos HORA FELIZ en Yahoo!

En verdad somos los adultos quienes creamos inseguridad en nuestros ni?os, ellos no saben lo que es ir al cole, como es algo nuevo lo mejor es tomarlo de manera natural y con entusiasmo, predisponerlos a todo lo bueno que conlleva la vida escolar y demostrarles que nos gusta para que a ellos también les guste.

Por ejemplo, a una persona autista puede molestarle un ruido que a una persona no autista pasa desapercibido. En muchos casos la molestia puede ser extrema, al grado de llevar a comportamiento violento. Por otro lado, un autista puede tener una gran tolerancia al dolor. Algunos aseguran que no se percatan del hambre o de otras necesidades biológicas.<br>  <br>  En una minoría de los casos (no se conocen cifras exactas) puede haber un comportamiento auto-da?ino, por ejemplo, el de golpearse la cabeza contra una pared. Otros comportamientos típicamente descritos son los de dar vueltas constantemente y aletear las manos.<br>  <br>  Otros desórdenes, incluyendo el síndrome de Tourette, impedimentos en el aprendizaje y el trastorno de déficit de atención, a menudo concurren con el autismo, pero no lo causan. Debido a razones aún desconocidas, alrededor del 20% al 30% de las personas con autismo también desarrollan epilepsia cuando llegan a la etapa adulta.<br>  <br>  Algunos autistas consideran que el autismo les da ciertas ventajas. éste es el caso del Premio Nobel de Economía Vernon Smith [7], quien dice que el autismo es una "ventaja selectiva" ya que le proporciona la habilidad para hiperconcentrarse (una habilidad también apuntada por personas con TDAH).<br>  <br>  La creencia común de que los autistas no tienen sentimientos no tiene una base real. De hecho, los autistas parecen ser bastante sensibles en muchos sentidos. La dificultad se presenta en la expresión de los sentimientos, que se interpreta como una falta de los mismos.<br>  <br>  Los autistas suelen referirse a sus características obsesivas como "perseverancias" y en algunos casos las consideran ventajosas. Algunos autistas cambian sus "perseverancias" con regularidad y otros tienen una sola "perseverancia" principal de por vida.<br>  <br>  Las causas del autismo se desconocen en una generalidad de los casos, pero muchos investigadores creen que es el resultado de algún factor ambiental que interactúa con una suceptibilidad genética.<br>  <br>  Harris Coulter, director del Center for Empirical Medicine en Washington, D.C., e historiador cuyos muchos libros han rese?ado la evolución de la ortodoxia médica en los Estados Unidos, ha hecho el cargo inicial que mucho del autismo fue causado por la administración en la ni?ez temprana de la vacuna contra la tos ferina de célula completa. En dos libros recientes (DPT: "A Shot in the Dark", por Harris Coulter y Barbara Fisher, publicado por Harcourt Brace Jovanovich en 1985 y "Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality", publicado en 1990 por Nort Atlantic Books), Coulter ha reunido importante y abrumadora evidencia circunstancial en contra de la vacuna anti tosferínica y ha clamado por la realización de estudios para esclarecer su relación causal con el autismo inducido por encefalitis, el da?o cerebral y la muerte por apnea (paro respiratorio) conocidon comunmente como SIDS. Atacado por las compa?ías farmacúticas y por grandes segmentos de la comunidad médica como alarmista y prejuiciado contra las compa?ías farmaceúticas, Coulter sin embargo ha cautivado persuasivamente la atención de algunos especialistas en autismo tales como el Dr. Bernard Rimmland, además de haber elevado un tipo de alerta crítica de ciertos padres preocupados.<br>  <br>  Su cargo ha generado también una explicación a la mayor incidencia del autismo en los varones por su desarrollo más lento que las ni?as, siendo por tanto sus cerebros más vulnerables a las edades en las que la inoculación DPT normalmente se lleva a cabo. También por ello se explica por qué ciertos países como Japón o el Reino Unido, presentan menos incidencia de autismo, pues sus campa?as de vacunación son más tardías y en Inglaterra la vacuna antitosferina, aunque común, sigue siendo enteramente electiva. En caso de ni?os con alergias, sobretodo a la leche, los efectos de la vacuna DPT son aún más pronunciados.<br>  <br>  En su presentación más básica, el argumento de Coulter se compone de tres argumentos factuales relacionados: La bacteria de la tos ferina se sabe que causa una inflamación cerebral, la cual a veces ocasiona da?os difusos, indiscriminados y permanentes; las vacunas contra muchos tipos de bacterias se sabe provocan inflamación cerebral y no fue hasta 1992 en que se introdujo en los Estados Unidos una vacuna antitosferínica aparentemente más segura basada en medias células y no células completas de la bacteria causante de la tos ferina. Por consiguiente, no es un salto sin precaución concluir que por muchos a?os la vacuna DPT ha causado mucho da?o cerebral e incapacidad permanente. Y aunque las campa?as de vacunación no son responsables de todas las incapacidades y males sociales, contribuyen substantivamente a su incremento.<br>  <br>  No existe por ahora un tratamiento que cure el autismo. En la actualidad el tratamiento preferido está basado en el análisis conductual aplicado (Applied Behavior Analysis o ABA), puesto que estudios científicos e independientes han demostrado su utilidad para elevar el nivel de funcionamiento de los ni?os con comportamientos autistas. Se cree que un inicio temprano de la terapia y la intensidad del mismo mejora las probabilidades de aumentar el nivel de funcionamiento.<br>  <br>  Existen una serie de tratamientos no probados populares con los padres de ni?os autistas. Tal es el caso de tratamientos biológicos y terapias de diversos tipos. A día de hoy sin embargo, sólo los tratamientos conductuales presentan fuerte evidencia a su favor.<br>  <br>  La educación como el vehículo para el tratamiento de las personas con autismo, es necesario crear programas educativos adptados a las necesidades individuales de cada persona con autismo. Cabe destacar el trabajo que se está realizando con algunas personas con autismo en el campo de la Planificación centrada en la persona (PCP)|`|HBD0K4c5aa	Jodelo porque si no luego el sera el que te jodera a ti|`|PCl4pTftaa	pues para sacarte de dudas puedes consultar otra u otras opiniones psicológicas, llévalo con otro psicólogo y compara sus conclusiones, no te cierres en la opinión de uno solo.|`|Q6GgDd4Kaa	Hola.

e453da8c0d9add951e116701277a7778aa	A ver, Isa, si logro aclararte el lío que tienes, reina...<br>  <br>  La píldora anticonceptiva "del día antes", como tú la llamas, y yo doy por sentado que es la anti-baby de toma la vida, se toma durante un período de 21 días y se descansa otros 7; durante esa semana de descanso se presenta una hemorragia similar a la menstruación (no se considera menstruación porque no hay óvulo que eliminar). Desde el primer día que tomes este tratamiento, e incluso durante la semana de descanso, estás protegida frente a un embarazo accidental, siempre y cuando tomes unas sencillas precauciones:<br>  <br>  - Tomar la píldora cada día, siempre a la misma hora (aunque hay un margen relativamente amplio, pero mejor así)<br>  - Tomar una pildora extra, de un envase de reserva que es más que recomendable tener, si vomitas antes de que se cumplan dos horas de haber tomado la píldora, o si tienes diarrea<br>  - Usar métodos de barrera (condón, diafragma o esponja) durante el resto del ciclo, si se incumple una de las condiciones anteriores, pues la efectovidad bajaría mucho entonces<br>  - Consultar con el médico (vale de médico de familia, no hay que ir necesariamente al ginecólogo) si sigues algún otro tratamiento, pues algunos fármacos, como los antibióticos, merman la efectividad de la anticoncepción hormonal, y en estos casos puede ser necesario usar, además, condones.<br>  <br>  Si tomas anticoncepción oral "normal", no tiene el menor sentido, salvo la salvajada hormonal que le has hecho a tu cuerpo, que tomes la píldora del día después. Esta medicación está pensada para mujeres que usan anticoncepción de barrera (o que no usan anticonceptivos) y tienes relaciones sexuales en las que se rompe el condón (o no se respetan los plazos de espera para los geles del diafragma, por ejemplo) o para las mujeres célibes que tienen relaciones sexuales "inesperadas" (e incluso no consentidas, como en el caso de las víctimas de abusos sexuales).<br>  <br>  De no haber estado tomando la antibaby y rompérsete el condón, es lógico (y más que sensato) haberte tomado la del día después, y cuanto antes mejor. Pero sigo sin explicarme lo que has hecho, salvo que estés tan perdida que creas que la píldora se toma "antes de" (como creen muchos jóvenes que he conocido). Si dieras más detalles (mándame mail si no quieres extender la pregunta), podría informarte mejor.<br>  <br>  Supongo que a estas alturas sobra decir que tienes todos los números para NO estar embarazada.<br>  <br>  Lo que sí puedes esperar, con la  burrada que le has hecho a tu organismo, es hinchazón de las piernas (porque retendrás líquido), dolores de cabeza, mal humor, mareos (incluso puede que con náuseas), somnolencia... vamos, como un síndrome premenstrual, pero a lo bestia. Esos son los efectos de la anticoncepción oral, que se magnifican en el caso de tomar anticoncepción oral de emergencia (=píldora del día después).<br>  <br>  Bueno, creo que no se me queda nada en el tintero, salco recomendarte encarecidamente que, una vez pasados los nervios, acudas a tu centro de planificación familiar más cercano (en su defecto, a un punto de información juvenil, donde te dirigirán a un servicio gratuito de este tipo, especial para jovenes) para que te expliquen más detalladamente cómo usar responsablemente la anticoncepción oral, si bien, a título personal, me parece una muy buena idea combinarla con el uso del condón (eso es lo que hago yo misma, para estar tranquila en todos los aspectos).<br>  <br>  Bueno, guapa, espero haberte ayudado con todo esto.

6wab30hWaa	Encuentro que tu eres un chico muy responsable y buena gente y eso esta muy bien por que además eres respetuoso.Lo primero que has de hacer,es hacerle ver que es algo normal de esta vida,que la primera vez tal vez sea algo molesto,pero después descubrirá que no pasa nada y que tu sabes que lo ha pasado mal pero esos recuerdos dolorosos ha de dejarlos atrás.Otra opción seria que fuera a un especialista para que pudiera sacarle esos miedos y temores que todavía existen dentro de ella.Cuando queráis intentarlo,se delicado con ella,ves poco a poco para que ella pueda sentirse mas a gusto y quizás en una de esas pase todo ya que la primera vez puede resultar un poco dolorosa para ella,pero todo pasara si te quiere realmente,lo que pasa es que lo vera como algo feo y sucio,después de lo pasado.<br>  Saludos y mucha paciencia,si os queréis vale la pena esperar.|`|BgeOWsZiaa	yo sufri algo parecido, no fue violacion, pero fue abuso <br>  sexual<br>  es dificil confiar en alguien y mas dificil aun cuando alguien vive algo asi<br>  <br>  si ella insiste tanto intenta no preocuparla<br>  cuando esten a punto y veas ke komienza a llorar<br>  acaricia su cabello de forma romantica, dile ke la amas y k todo va a salir bien<br>  <br>  para ella esas palabras seran de muxo consuelo n_n<br>  y vivan felices|`|YSVRPD8qaa	ah pues esta dificil la cosa, obviamente no lo ha superado, pero si ella quiere intentarlo contigo me parece que podrias intentar una velada super romantica con velas, inciensos, flores, todo bien arreglado, y comportate lo mas cari?oso posible y dile cosas lindas al oido y se todo un caballero.

I doubt you will get a Paps and blood work that day! <br>  <br>  he wil give you vitamins and books probably.|`|MMDRp02Gaa	they will do all the fun stuff on your first visit! like take your blood, ask medical questions about you and your baby's dad, i think they will do a ultra sound on your first visit also to measure the baby's due date, good luck|`|OwajU3sPaa	I'm in England and i dint know if things are different here from where you are but when i went to the doctors to tell them i was pregnant all they did was ask dates of LMP and take my blood presser and book me in, now im waiting on a appointment for a scan at the hospital and a date to see my midwife. here it is just a rutine chat really.|`|ZUzwkAllaa	well they will do a pap to check for std's and any abnormal cells. They will do blood work to check for anemia, rh factor, possibly check your hcg levels and I think to see what your blood type is.<br>  <br>  They will also give you an EDD based on your lmp.
cF3FbVofaa	I have a daughter that was born with a cleft lip and palate, so I understand the speech issues..M's are the easiest for my daughter to say..R's are pretty difficult..So are L's, atleast for her...Her sister's name is Eva Marie and she can actually say it...Her name is Ella and she'll hardly attempt that name at all...I'll say, "what's YOUR name" she'll say "Eva"..I'd say pick out the name that you like the most, if anything she'll probably end up with a nickname, something close to how your boys say her name..Every name you have there (and they are all GREAT names) are going to pose a problem with speech in some way...I'll always love Eva, but Ava is a popular name..My daughter can say that, trust me, her speech is pretty far behind..Ava Marie is very pretty!  Good luck to you and your family!  I'm sure you'll come up with the perfect name for your new addition!|`|wqbZbwpBaa	Isabella Marie VanRiper-Williamson. And I would suggest only using one middle name for school (if you want. for example, my friend's last name is MacDonald VanRiper(Same name !!), but she only uses MacDonald at school.) Rose would also be good, because it would bring the name down to less sylables. But I think Isabella is the best! If your boys have trouble saying that, she could be nicknamed Bella, Izzie, or another of you choice. Good luck and a big congrats !|`|NJkyxRHmaa	I like the name Torielle. (Tory-el) I got that because I was playing Sims 2 and my Sims had a baby, the dad's name was Torence and the mom's name was Gabrielle and so I put the names together. Torielle. Hahaha, anyway, I think the name is pretty. Good luck.<br>  |`|bMZ7lOfVaa	I think Hannah Marie would be really easy for your boys to say.

NroZQN5vaa	I think Bailey Jean sounds better. Bailey Marie is kind of rhymey and I don't like it so much. You could put the two together Bailey Jean-Marie Brown. I know several people who have two middle names because they're both family names.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Neither<br>  <br>  Bailey is a masculine BOYS name. Also it is the name of an alcoholic drink! Why would you want to name your child after an alcoholic drink.<br>  <br>  Jean Marie is a nice name.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I like Bailey Marie Brown because Bailey Jean makes me think of Jelly Bean! <br>  <br>  ---- think about it ----|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Bailey Marie.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I am not a fan of Jean or Marie, less so,Jean.

Just a thought but you could switch it up, Bailee, Baileigh, Baylee, Baylei. ( I Love to play with the spelling of names for some reason)<br>  If that's not in your plan... Then i guess i Vote Bailey Jean<br>  It rolls off the tongue easier.<br>  I wish you the best!|`|3KoGUAfLaa	When I first read Bailey Jean I heard "Billy Jean is not my lover..."<br>  <br>  Even though it reminds me of the Michael Jackson song, it sounds better. Ha ha, I can see her good friends making fun of her now :D In a good way :)|`|fPuZGkmsaa	I would go with Bailey Marie Brown. I think that it flows nicely. In the end it is entirely up to you. I personally like the name Bailey.|`|5QtseYWuaa	I like Bailey Marie. <br>  I know a girl her name is Bailey Mae and I've always really liked it but yeah my favorite is Bailey Marie.|`|U0XdcLfCaa	Bailey is an AWESOME name.<br>  <br>  I would go with Jean because everybody and their DOG'S middle name is Marie.|`|xmmpqySUaa	Bailey Marie Brownn......Bailey is a beautiful name!|`|xNSThNlOaa	bailey jean sounds like billy jean is not my lover! bailey jean brown = country!!!<br>  <br>  maybe Bailey Rae or Bailey True.

I like the name Bailey :)|`|DjMqxsfuaa	They're both adorable names! but I like the sound of Bailey Marie better.|`|SJEqXq21aa	Bailey is a beautiful name i really like it...<br>  Bailey Jean for sure! ;)|`|MW1yrHbOaa	bailey marie is cute, bailey jean reminds me of the michael jackson song billie jean|`|hJoB7VR1aa	I love the name Bailey. My daughter's name is Bailey, but I spelled it Baylie and her middle name is Rylynn. <br>  I would go with Bailey Marie.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	After just answering your other question, I'm liking Bailey Jean Marie better than Bailey Marie or Bailey Jean. The extra middle name really adds something and sounds nice.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I kinda like Bailey Jean a little better then Bailey Marie... they are both cute though.<br>  <br>  But I think Bailey Marie Brown Sounds better.|`|AA12209656	My aunt was going to name her baby Bailey Jean after her grandma, Bella Jean. But she ended up having 3 boys instead.<br>  <br>  I've always thought it had a nice ring to it so I would go with Bailey Jean =)|`|AA10325228	Bailey Jean sounds better to me
EXBMxFCKaa	Personal Thoughts: I like the name Melanie, I think it is very underused and is much more feminine and becoming than the more popular "Madison" I really like its versitility as well. Melanie Johanna sounds alright, the balance of syllables is ideal but I like something more like Melanie Christine, Johanna would take some getting used to for me. <br>  <br>  Lanie: Very cute nickname for a little girl and a teenager, I prefer it to Mellie which I could also see her getting a lot in school. <br>  <br>  Very elegant name that's found a great medium between old-fashioned and trendy.|`|UCkkrhdhaa	I think both sound okay. The first is a cute combo and the nickname of Lanie will set her apart from any other Melanies since the more common nickname is Mel.|`|voyH3d1Kaa	That's a very pretty name<br>  <br>  I prefer Joanna though. Pronounced Jo-anna|`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	I like Melaney Joanne<br>  And Lanie is kinda different than Melaney<br>  God bless|`|oxxBmhV0aa	I like them..Melanie is a beautiful name.|`|u6cFXfPnaa	I don't like Johanna. It's usually pronounced Yo-hanna. If you want to pronounce it Jo-hannah, then I'd spell it like Joanna at least. I like it better spelled like that, but it's still not my favorite. Lanie I think is fine as a nickname, but personally I would call her Melanie. It's already a cute name, I'm not a huge fan of cutesy names. |`|3CKspZxPaa	Melanie Johanna is beautiful. im not a fan of johanna but as a middle name for melanie its very pretty. lanie sounds like a great nickname, unique but not weird. hope this helps :]|`|wcNdpyGbaa	Lanie isn't different to me! My first name is Lani. Pronounced the same.<br>  For some information the name Lani, it's Hawaiian for Heavenly skies|`|BFrpf8g1aa	I like Melanie Johanna that is a very unique name not a combo I ever heard before...Lanie is not really that close to Melanie but it is cute...so hey why not|`|13ba52d1d8f776526728149760b05c93aa	I like everything about it! Melanie Johanna sounds beautiful, and Lanie is a very pretty nickname.|`|181WVEyyaa	well all the melanies i have met have all been called "Mel" which is what turned me off the name. calling her Lanie does make the name more appealing, and trendy. <br>  nice name. |`|cEw3V7Blaa	I love it!  It's a very pretty name, and I think Lanie is a great nickname for Melanie.|`|8005b8bf0bacf864fdd70082653cb325aa	Yer the name is ok but Lanie is to different from Melanie|`|htjgd0oXaa	Melanie Johanna is really cute.<br>  <br>  Lanie is a great nickname for Melanie.|`|QEvXgMTGaa	I have herd of Lainey before!!! IU love it|`|CMuL7XpKaa	yeah, Lovely
qqiVKUBpaa	Rhoswen is kind of cool. I don't think I've ever seen that name before.|`|4YqL4iCcaa	I really like Annily Jane- its cute and I can see it on a child and adult...also have you every year the name Bronwyn? It seems like a name that would fit with the names you have listed...Maybe Bronwyn Grace. Congratulations! |`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	I like Livi Adabelle instead of Livi Adabella.<br>  God bless.|`|E8kzNG3iaa	My fave is Katherine Juliette :)|`|Ux0F7WJJaa	Juliette, Keira, Aurora, Jane. Love the middle names! Not so hot on the first names.  Kendall is ok if spelled this way.  Would you consider making any of the middles a first instead?<br>  <br>  Aurora Juliette? With the nn Rory is so cute. Or Keira Juliette?<br>  <br>  If I had to choose from your names I would say Katherine Juliette.|`|WBV16h9jaa	Katherine is nice but I personally prefer it with a C, as it looks a bit softer.  Juliette is nice, but Julia is nicer :)|`|FhSCxiPZaa	Rayleigh Jane is my personal favorite then Katherine Juliette<br>  :D|`|mJ5kGMrFaa	Katherine is my favorite.  The rest are spelled too funny for my taste.|`|Wqv9Jmkkaa	Annily Jane!!<br>  it's adorable|`|rHZivjUGaa	Katherine, I can't even read out the other names!|`|6CARSUUjaa	i think Annily Jane or Katherine Juliette those are really good and unique but great!|`|8vOPMannaa	I like Rayleigh Jane.|`|1w1aEKu6aa	are you serious...what are you thinking?  Your kid will have to walk through her entire life with that cr*p for a name. What kind of mother does that?|`|WWVshXqiaa	If I had to choose out of any one those names it would be Rayleigh Jane, but I'm not sure Jane is a very good middle name with rayleigh<br>  another nice name is leighton rose|`|fOVVSAZ2aa	Annily Jane|`|ndc5PhtHaa	I like Katherine Juliette, Rayleigh Jane, and Kendahl Kiera the best. |`|pVT9yLMhaa	I like Katherine and Rayleigh|`|181WVEyyaa	weird names and stupid spellings ruin all of them.<br>  <br>  katherine is the only normal one. juliette is yuck|`|dwOLnFnlaa	Katherine Juliette is beautiful, I love it :)|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Katherine Juliette! Most definitely. It's by far the cutest name. It flows very well and sounds amazing. It's a name that will definitely grow with her. Good luck! :o)
2l636NUvaa	Aidan James<br>  Lucas James<br>  Liam James<br>  <br>  Overall I prefer Liam James, because I am not a HUGE fan of the name Lucas (prefer Luke) and Aidan (though I love it) is becoming overused. Second preference would be Aidan James.<br>  <br>  Kiara Grace<br>  Olivia Paige<br>  Sienna Rose<br>  Natalie Grace<br>  <br>  Overall I prefer Kiara Grace because Kiara is such a lovely name and yet quite uncommon. Grace is a very cute middle name to go with it. Second I would choose Sienna Rose, but I think that Kate and Paige both go just as nicely with Sienna as Rose does. <br>  <br>  Good luck choosing your final name for either your beautiful son or daughter! Your taste in names is very nice.|`|sHzSYL5raa	Aidan is very mature and sophistacated, i like it, Aidan Matthew would be my choice....<br>  Lucas is very amazing and adorable, Lucas James would be my choice......<br>  Liam is very cool and rockstarish, i like it, Liam Seth would be my choice....<br>  Kiara is very unique and unusual, i like it, Kiara Paige is my choice.....<br>  Olivia is very pretty with Kate, i like it....<br>  Sienna is very cute and is my favrite overall.....with Paige<br>  Natalie Kate is CUTE but Natalie Grace hands down.....<br>  <br>  Love XXXxxx<br>  |`|rdbRGWfzaa	Aidan James - A.J. could be a cute nickname<br>  <br>  Lucas James - his nickname could be L.J. (thats my nephews nickname)<br>  <br>  Liam James - again, his nickname could be L.J.<br>  <br>  *As you can see James is one of my favorite boy names<br>  <br>  Kiara Grace - sorry not my favorite, Grace is pretty but I dont like Kiara<br>  <br>  Olivia Rose - This is so pretty! i wish I would have thought of it! Olivia is one of my favorite girl names!<br>  <br>  Sienna Rose - i love it, it sounds so sweet<br>  <br>  Natalie Grace - it's a pretty name but I dont like the name natalie...Nat would probably be her nickname and it just reminds me of the bug<br>  <br>  overall, my favorite boy name is Lucas James and my favorite girl name is Olivia Rose<br>  |`|9mSBlBkIaa	Well, it also depends on what your last name is, cuz you want the first and middle name to also have chemistry with the last name...<br>  I personally like Lucas (Luke for short) and the one that goes best with that is James....And I like Grace. But the only one that goes well with that I think is Olivia. Like Olivia Grace, or Liv Grace. Not big on Sienna, reminds me too much of Sienna Miller, and Rose is too common now, and sounds a bit old fashioned, even tho its still a nice name...<br>  So overall, Lucas James or James Lucas...<br>  And Olivia Grace, but I really like Liv Grace.|`|CScarqBZaa	I absolutely  love the name Aidan so i would have to say Aidan-James and out of your girls name  i really like Sienna-Rose and Kiara-Grace and i like the names Paige and Kate maybe Olivia Kate, Natalie Paige, Lauren Kate... Good luck...|`|Drr89BVmaa	I would go<br>  Aiden James (3)<br>  Lucas James (2)<br>  Liam Anthony (1)<br>  <br>  <br>  Kiara Grace (4)<br>  Olivia Rose (1)<br>  Sienna Kate (3)<br>  Natalie Kate (2)|`|Bj5ywGhUaa	I think they are all pretty names. But for a boy I like Aidan James and for a girl I like Natalie Grace, or Kiara Grace. I know how hard it is to pick names, there are so many! I wish you the best of luck to you and your new baby. |`|xMBEIw5oaa	Liam James & Sienna or Olivia Rose|`|HN9twtQlaa	Boys:<br>  <br>  Aidan James - This name flows best, and I love the timelessness of the name James. <br>  Lucas Matthew - Even though I dislike having two-syllable names together, I chose the name Matthew via the process of elimination. I didn't like the way the 's' at the end of Lucas ran into the 's' at the beginning of Seth, and I didn't like the repetition of the end 's' sound in Lucas James. <br>  Liam James - I like the subtle repetition of the 'm' sound, and think that this name flows well. Seth is a close second. I wouldn't use Matthew because the 'm' sound at the end of Liam runs into the 'm' at the beginning of Matthew. <br>  <br>  If I had to choose one of these names I would go with: Liam James. Liam is a crisp, modern sounding Irish boys name. Aidan is nice, but it has become incredibly boring due to overuse (Aidan & all of it's rhyming variants are *very* popular). Lucas is quite a handsome name, but I'm not too fond of any of the middle names it's been paired with. Lucas Anthony is nice, as is Lucas William. <br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  <br>  Kiara Grace - this is simply done on the process of elimination, as I could not use the name Paige as it means 'servant' and 'little boy'. <br>  Olivia Kate - Olivia Rose is overdone, I see it on Y!A all the time. <br>  Sienna Rose - This is a bit overdone, but I enjoy the charming, romantic overtones of this name... and that both names are associated with the colour red. <br>  Natalie Grace - It just sounds the nicest to my ear.<br>  <br>  My favourite names from your girls list are Sienna Rose and Natalie Grace. I would probably go with the name Sienna, as it is ranked at #169 in popularity while Natalie is ranked at #17. If you really love the sound of the name Natalie, but are deterred by its popularity, you could always opt to use the beautiful French name Rosalie. It's pronounced rose-a-lee, and isn't even in the top 1000 names in the US. Rosalie Grace and Rosalie Kate are both very eye-catching, pretty names. |`|KOv8DVgZaa	Aidan James<br>  Lucas James<br>  Liam James or Tony James<br>  <br>  yeah so I think James suits them all the best<br>  <br>  Personally for a boy out of that list I like Aidan the best but it is nice and very thoughtful to name your child after someone and the person would be very flattered.<br>  <br>  Kiara Grace<br>  Olivia Rose<br>  Sienna Paige<br>  Natalie Grace<br>  <br>  of those I think they are all really lovely names but I think Natalie is the prettiest. Good luck.|`|Nh88Rlipaa	1. Liam Anthony (long form of Tony)<br>  2. Lucas James<br>  3. Aidan James - aka AJ<br>  <br>  1. Natalie Kate - beautiful name!<br>  2. Sienna Rose<br>  3.

miFe45quaa	1.) I think it's a very unique name. And it's interesting! I wouldn't consider it part of the "aden" trend, because as you said, it wasn't a big thing 6 years ago.    2.) I think I like it more. I've always preferred traditional names, but Shaden Thomas is kinda cute :) I'm glad she gave him a more classic/less unique middle name. It flows well.    I wasn't fond of the name Shaden (I've never heard of it til now) and I don't like the name Thomas. But it goes well.  xx|`|q7kiY8L7aa	i think it's really cute, the child is lucky to have a unique name. his time don't even really know about the "aden" trend so it's all good :)|`|T7nsmFAZaa	I think it's a horrible name, in all honesty.  It's made up, and it doesn't sound at all substantial enough for a grown man.  In addition, the "Shay" names are very girlish.    And the "-ayden" trend was already well underway six years ago when your half brother was named.|`|k8pFvtMLaa	I'm not crazy about it. And I do think it falls under the -aden trend. I know of Aidan, Braden, Caden, Hayden, Zayden, Raiden, Jayden, and Shaden. I do think it's kinda unique since it's not a common -aden name.|`|U56OqFe2aa	I don't like it. You can be way more creative then that, please don't put a lame spin on an "-aden" name.|`|5UY1rauZaa	it's a male name? I don't love it but I've heard faaaar worse!  and sorry I'm a mom, no time for long answers!!|`|181WVEyyaa	shaden sounds shady, maybe u can call him slim shady. lol. |`|cZfCw2UAaa	Honest opinion:  I liked it and thought it sounded like a natural melding of a couple of names, like Shane and Jayden. (I've seen a Braiden, too.)  I liked it, thought it sounded unique, but not freaky.  (and I've heard some freaky ones, I'm a teacher).  Kind of cool, not too flamboyant; nice name.and Shaden Thomas rolls off the tongue, good to have such a traditional middle name.  So in conclusion I would say I vote yes on Shaden and Congratulations to you.|`|XZ6gQOwfaa	My little cousin is named Shayden, and until now, he was the only Shayden/Shaden I'd ever heard of. It's definitely a unique name... I don't think his teachers have to call him Shaden (Last-Name-Initial)!  And Thomas goes well as a middle name.    Does your brother like his name?|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Like I was just saying a minute ago.  Emergency Room charts the othe day we had so many Jadah Jadyn Jada Jaylee Jadenee names I thought I was going crazy trying to keep their labs and stuff in correct charts.    And we see so many of the dumb 'aden names.  It reminds me of the Mohammid name in Islam already.    Enough of the ADEN NAMES ALREADY
PD8l8xqDaa	Samuel James is definitely the one!<br>  It sounds so.. proper... if that makes any sense, :)<br>  <br>  Also, the name Samuel can be adapted as he grows up.<br>  Sammy, for when he's little.<br>  Sam, for when he's a little older.<br>  And Samuel, for when he's in trouble.<br>  <br>  Aw, gorgeous name. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped<br>  Good luck <br>  <br>  + Congratulations x|`|Elxuvon8aa	Samuel James sounds good  Zachery James sounds good|`|xLabGD6Maa	I like Benjamin and Samuel. Timeless.<br>  Zach is blah and Lewis is a surname.|`|zgT2rB0zaa	Zach is my favorite but I prefer it spelled 'zak' because the 'ch' always bothered be being pronounced like a k. <br>  <br>  Zakary James is a very nice name or Zachary James depending on how you spell it|`|6loH10bVaa	I like benjamin james<br>  <br>  Zachary Lewis <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|5It6FLCBaa	i personnaly like  Benjamin and Lewis|`|LcOPL8gCaa	 I like Pric (Sorry forgot how to speller name) said Zakary james and or Zachary James<br>  <br>  Vercy Nice!! GLUCK|`|181WVEyyaa	anyone with initials BJ will be in for a teasing!<br>  samuel james doesnt really flow that good. samuel makes a great middle name. benjamin samuel or something.<br>  zach is a cute name. i like this one!<br>  lewis is a common surname so i dont like it as a first name. |`|T9SS5QBmaa	Zach is great, it is heard of/commonish & yet still rare enough.<br>  <br>  James...seriously? <br>  The name has lost all beauty and is boring.<br>  <br>  Zachery Lewis.|`|JD4Yy6bCaa	Benjamin is a really great name, and I don't hear it too often. I might name a little boy that myself.|`|thMHYPmlaa	Zachary Lewis or Benjamin James x|`|ieGGbWgZaa	Samuel|`|gbaTYv4xaa	lewis.|`|AA10047696	Zach sounds cool
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Lilly Ella is a cute Name..|`|u7o75zipaa	Lilly I absolutely LOVE. But not with Ella .. lol. Lilly and Ella are both great names, and I think they both sound nice followed by "Mae". <br>  <br>  Lexie is really cute! It's a great nickname for Alexis, which I love. <br>  <br>  As I don't really like Lilly and Ella together I'd have to go with Lexie. |`|eBKJRmEgaa	Lily Ella because Lexie is just a nickname. But I dislike Lily-Ella because it is SO cutesy, it won't age well at all.<br>  Alexandra would be my choice over both.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS, Lily is the correct spelling, like the flower.|`|eA817mGoaa	lilly-ella, it just sounds delicate and pretty, like a flower. and lexie reminds me of a girl i used to hate in hs :)|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Alexis is nicer. Lexie sounds like a nickname. :-)|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Ella is a nice name|`|HN9twtQlaa	I don't like the names Lilly and Ella when they're hypenated. It looks a bit too pretentious to me. I also dislike giving nicknames instead of formal names, so even though I like the nickname Lexie, Lilly-Ella wins by default. <br>  <br>  I would recommend: use Lexie as a nickname for Alexandra, Alexandria, Alexis, Alexandrie or Alexandrine. <br>  <br>  Instead of the name Lilly-Ella, why not: Lilly Elizabeth, Lily Eliana, Lilly Eleanor, Lily Elisabeth, Lilly Elaheh, Lilly Elaine, Lilly Electra, Lilly Elena, Lily Elliot, Lilly Eliza, Lily Elise, Lily Elodia, Lily Eloise or Lily Elysia. |`|93f5bc2f17989cfb856983126c1aa33caa	Both names are sweet and imaginative.<br>  I prefer Lily-Ella though, its always a good idea to have room for the namee to alter her name when she gets into those creative teenage years. All of mine have either shortened, lengthened or added the odd x or z, here and there.<br>  The problem with Lexie is that "thats all there is", its a difficult name to alter and it will be assumed that its a shortening of Alexis, Alexandria.|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	haha-alex curran (steven gerrard's wife)named her daughters those names!!!!!<br>  <br>   i like both names but i like ella on it's own better-but out of the two i like Lexie......|`|nkM6wmv6aa	neither. Lilly is nice. Ella is nice. Lexie is nice as a nickname ONLY. But Lilly-Ella together is too much.|`|jEB0F18faa	I prefer lexie. Lily-Ella sounds too made up. Lily is quite nice by itself too.|`|VvPJkjjZaa	I prefer Lexie out the two. But I do like the names Lilly and Ella but I think it would be better if Ella was just a middle name instead of joined with Lilly.|`|Pgsq2GfBaa	Alexandra Lilly...Lexie for short|`|JPaT4BT4aa	i just likwe lilly on its own but Lexie is nice x|`|35ede025973851f9668b84f73a5f8796aa	Lila.<br>  <br>  Lexi(e) is a soap opera character, and Lexi/Lexus sounds like an adult movie actor. No, no explaining but I'm old enough that when dirt couldn't be there for Genesis 1:1 I stood in...<br>  <br>  (please no rimshots, the drum's a rental)<br>  <br>  Well, never mind, you asked and I hope it's healthy.|`|PxEt4iSOaa	Lexie sounds strong, you can imagine Lexie coming out of the boardroom. You cant imagine Lilly-Ella in a serious, high powered position.<br>  Plus I always think those double barrelled names sound a bit pikyish, sorry.|`|jS9FPRWBaa	I love both of those names.<br>  Personally cos my name is Lily.<br>  But i would have to go with Lexie, its really exciting and cool.<br>  Lilly-Ella... I think they should be kept seperate. not as one name.<br>  <br>  =)|`|IYkis9tgaa	Lexie all the way - it's gorgeous i want to call my little girl lexie if i have a girl. Lexie - Grace would be lovely!!!<br>  <br>  Don't like lilly-ella its too much of a mouth full.|`|181WVEyyaa	lilly ella doesnt flow at all!!!<br>  <br>  lillian if u want a longer name than lilly.<br>  lexie is a great nn for alexia or alexis. i love those names, but my friend used it! :(<br>  <br>  gl choosing|`|SqW9ZJBmaa	Too many Ella's about and Lilly sounds dull. Love Lexie, but I agree with others Alexia is cool.|`|4CyhY6Q1aa	i prefer Lilly Ella even though i love Lexie i'd want to make it a nickname! |`|VwmqpqHiaa	i prefer the name Lilly-Ella. x|`|xMPQV5J1aa	lexie, lilly ella is pretty but too long in the tooth.  |`|uf6efp0Naa	Lexie - I just like the name|`|KOvzRtd0aa	Too many 'l's|`|wxFyC6PDaa	Lilly on it's own |`|g6MgOlx4aa	nop<br>  
ui7waO1haa	I like Leigha better because it has a ring to it. It's different, but in a good way. Good luck!|`|miFe45quaa	I prefer Leah. Leigha looks like a mouthful, and the little girl would have to correct people all the time.<br>  <br>  I really like the spelling - Lia. I think it's short and sweet, even better than Leah :)<br>  <br>  xx|`|D4ow1TIgaa	I like Leah  better. That way she will never have to correct people on how they spell her name. Or some may even pronounce it wrong.  But i love the name Leah! :)|`|4ec27dca9c261de9c39abd8e0dd218f5aa	I like Leah best. Leigha looks strange and the child would probably spend half her life correcting people when they spell it.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Leah. Leigha looks strange.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	defiently Leigha!!!!!! please not Leah!!!!|`|ZKDIMnVKaa	Leah, Leigha looks weird.|`|AA11393938	Lea would be nicer|`|LEImGspmaa	leah|`|pHNKGXYXaa	I think that Leigha is better. Because Many people spell the name Leah and then if the girl named "Leah or Leigha" has another Leah in their class at school then the teachers will easily get the cildrens' papers mixed up. my name is Marisa and most people spell it Marissa, Marrisa, Mariisa, Marrisa, or Marrissa. So why not go for the most unusual name? |`|SUX4KOU5aa	I've always liked mine best: Leia. Definitely not Leigha--it reads like "leg-ha, no wait, lee-a?" Leah is my second favorite, because it's traditional, but I really prefer it without the H at the end, it's such a bring down sound. like lee-uh instead of lee-ya.|`|aWU6YCH3aa	leah it just looks better|`|AjYfIvTZaa	could try lea, still works.|`|pCZPtegeaa	Out of your two choices, I like Leah better. Leigha just seems a bit unorganized, if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the spellings Lia or Leia.|`|rHZivjUGaa	Leah..is a really nice spelling and classic, but the other looks like you are trying to hard.  I feel the same about Breighanne, Ashleigh, Ashlee...|`|CXU242lZaa	what abou liah? or leeha? leighah? leiah? lia? leyah? liia?<br>  just suggestions.|`|6qrcY4Jbaa	i like Leigha cuz it is so original,,,, it is much cooler|`|GCN3dquAaa	Leigha isn't bad. It's a little strange looking, but I think it could grow on me.<br>  I think I like Leah more though.|`|2baAorp2aa	Leah <br>  because Leigha sounds like Leighla (Layla) without the L|`|181WVEyyaa	leah looks better, and is easier to spell. leigha looks cheap. |`|AA11018222	Leah|`|bWagV9CZaa	Leah :D|`|wRnnxg5saa	Leah|`|J2gr1ogHaa	leah, leigha looks hooked on phonics like|`|DMvqOxtvaa	I like Leigha it is unique.|`|a3f7e0aff698dc0f0c2fd1d17df6bb4baa	Leah.  If you name her Leigha, people are going to constantly pronounce it wrong.|`|5Qp91ZS1aa	Leah....Leigha is more difficult|`|VgeWlecbaa	Leigha because it's more unique plus if people were to pronounce it wrong, they'd be stupid.|`|YMoBKBjtaa	I like Leah the best out of those two. Leigha just looks kind of strange, not as beautiful, and will probably get pronounced wrong a lot. My favorite spelling of the name, though, is Lia - I just love it!!!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Leah is my fav <br>  2. Lea<br>  3. Lia<br>  4. Liah<br>  5. Leigha<br>  6. Leea|`|5sYzlAjPaa	i like Leah, because that is the original biblical spelling, and it is the most practical, easiest to pronounce and spell.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Leah - it i classic and people won't get it wrong. She'll thank you later because she won't always have to correct people and get annoyed about it. <br>  <br>  Lia is nice too- I also knew one once.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	I like Leah better, but fir a nickname (Lee, even though Leah is short enough) I like Leigh. Leigha is too confusing. |`|UJaCObdyaa	Lia - this spelling is much prettier.
KSWL6mkHaa	Do whatever you feel comfortable in|`|8E215DgRaa	I didn't pack my bag until my water broke.  If you have a normal delivery, you will only be there a couple days, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  I know you want to look good and all, but if it's your first child, you should have plenty of time to throw some stuff in a bag.  Just make sure you have an idea of what you want to take with you.  On the other hand, if you feel more comfortable with it packed 3 months ahead of time, go for it becuase you've got enough on your plate when your pregnant, why add one more thing to worry about!|`|2zszNy7Aaa	Seriously, i packed my bag the day i went in labour. and then finished it off the next day before i was going into the hospital. Do you have relatives that coulld come in and bring you stuff? you have to be prepared if your little bub needs to stay a little longer. My son stayed for 5 days because he was sick but i had my mum that came in and took my washing home and washed it all. You need clothes, underwear, pads, your essentials, maybe some money if you wanted to pay for tv, The pediatrician guys are so hot so you want to look your best! lol.|`|181WVEyyaa	well i had my boy the day before i was buying my hospital stuff. lol.  so while i was in hospital my hubby went shopping for me. he got new pjs n everything. <br>  <br>  in my opinion, u feel like crap for the first day. so dont bother about face creams and stuff, u just want your baby and u wont care how u look.<br>  take a couple of pairs of undies for each day, because u may leak onto them if u bleed. in aussie we get given nappies and wipes in hospital. take some nice baby bath wash. our hospitals dont cater for that. take nice pjs and slippers, and take a supply of breast pads in case your milk comes in while u r at hospital. my milk came when i got home, but u may get yours early. take a phone charger, because u will need that. and dont forget your camera!!<br>  gl :)<br>  <br>  woops, forgot maternity bras.|`|56638d337acd9374814462c9cb38e0a7aa	I only stayed in hospital for 12 hours. so everythingi packed stayed there. <br>  i wished id packed chapsticks coz when ur doing all the breathing etc and they have aircon going my lips were soo dry. i packed makeup coz i wanted to look decentish, but never got looked at. u are soo intersted in the baby u forget all that stuff. take comfy pjs to wear in the hospital in he day, and something to go home in. pads are a must, nursing pads, undies, just comfortable stuff.|`|xKk1l01Aaa	I would start packing about 2 weeks before you are due that way when he/she comes you don't freak out and forget to pack something. It's not the best time to start packing when you go into labor. Make up is not really an essential when packing a deliever bag. I would pack some comfy clothes, something that you could fit in around 5-6 months pregnant.  Your stomach isn't going to go down right away. You will spend roughly a day to 3 days in the hospital. They will give you onies and diapers for your baby but pack a going home outfit. Both times that I had babies they have these nylon fishnet underwear that is really comfortable when wear the pads that they give you. You will bleed a lot after you have that baby so while you are in the hospital wear the pads that they give you. When you get home you can use your normal pads. I would bring some comfortable underwear if you like (2 pairs would do you). If you plan on breastfeeding I would wear or bring a breastfeeding bra, they are the most comfortable and when your breast start to get more of the milk in them it will expand with them instead of fight them. If you plan on bottle feeding they have formula for you at the hospital and will let you bring home a couple of premade bottles. You can bring some shower stuff but they have towels there for you. Don't forget your toothbrush. If you have any concerns you can call your local labor and deliever or mother baby unit and they will tell you what they will provide for you. I would bring some slippers too. They are just comfortable.

NJ8Kh0A9aa	He may have a stronger blue eye gene. Perhaps the brown eye gene was a bit recessive. Usually brown eyes are more dominant than blue. But physical traits can also skip a few generations. Perhaps one of your family memembers had blue eyes years back and you dont even know about. Maybe as early as  your mother or father. Or as late as your great great grandmother or grandfather. <br>  <br>  Ex. Mindy and Joel and a baby girl with red hair. Both of them had brown or black hair. But one of their family members had red hair. Red hair is just the ressesive gene that doesnt pop up a lot in their family.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	its hardd to say. what color are both your parents eyes<br>    my mother had blue eyes and father brown there are 7 of us- 3 brown 3 blue and one green|`|5M8kRqQ8aa	Brown eyes are usually dominant over blue, but if he has a recessive blue eye gene in his DNA the baby 's eyes could be blue.

The lady I work with had twin girls with the deepest blue eyes you've ever saw. Right before there one year birthday both girls eyes changed over to brown. The mother had brown eyes and the father had green eyes so they can change up too a year old. Like everyone else had said brown is dominant.

AA11036437	I have 5 year old identical twin girls. They were my first babies and I went totally crazy with the whole 2 of everything and wasted a whole lot of money. I had 2 moses baskets but as they were premature they spent 5 weeks in the special care baby unit. That meant the moses baskets were only really used for 2 months and at ￡65 each plus ￡12 for the stands... a bit of a waste of money. They didn't seem to sleep well in them anyway. They slept better sharing a cot bed (as the cot) Cot beds are bigger. I did get 2 cot beds which lasted until they were 4 then they went into regular beds. <br>  Had 2 high chairs the ones that turned into little table and chairs when they were bigger (thought they would be cute) but they took up soooo much room so got rid of them and they had highchair booster seats on the regular dining chairs.<br>  2 bouncy chairs... yes invest in those but they don't have to be all singing, dancing, vibrating, rocking bouncy chairs. Just the regular good old fashioned ones. I fed my twins in these until they were able to sit up unaided. <br>  I didn't spend a huge amount on the double buggy but there were not a lot of options at the time. This was the one thing the twins spent a lot of their time in and it lasted 3 years! Not bad for a ￡120 Graco double buggy. <br>  I dressed my girls exactly the same. Yes they looked cute and adorable but it has caused a lot of problems too. If one of the twins gets her pjs wet with juice or milk and I have to change her then her twin sister will have a huge tantrun until she gets the same pjs on as her sister. Makes a huge lot of washing and ironing I could do without! I would dress them similar but in different colours. I'm trying to teach then now that even though they look the same they are allowed to be different.<br>  We have a lot of 2 of everything in toys but we do encourage them to share the ones that we don't have 2 of.<br>  Also don't buy everything all in one go. Buy the baby stuff to begin with and the rest as they need it. I had everything for the 1st 18months before they were born and a lot of it was not used or used for only a short while. If you need any more advice feel free to email me. Good Luck with you twins!|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Hi congratulations. You definately don't need 2 of everything. I wouldn't even bother with moses baskets as most of the children I know have hated them. I would get 2 cots though I don't think a professional would recommend that the babies sleep together in 1 as you could easily put the cots next to one another. You will only need 1 bath, steriliser, baby ring, swing. I would get 2 bouncer chairs though. Good luck.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I registered for a double stroller, 2 car seats, 2 high chairs, 2 cribs, 2 bouncers, 2 swings, and double the diapers.  For the first few months you can put them in the same crib, but eventually you will need 2.  Instead of buying bassinets, we are just going to have them in one crib in the bedroom until they need two cribs and stay in their room.  Good luck and congratulations!|`|8hYKIRWiaa	my twins slept together until about 5 months then they went into their own crib.  I only used 1 swing at a time, but had 2 bouncers (they loved them).  I used 1 highchair unttil they were 1 year than bought another one.  Don't waste your money on mosses baskets they won't be in them long enough.  I only used 1 bath tub at a time.  I did find it really usful to have lots of bottles (if you aren't breastfeeding)  There are just sometimes that you don't want to wash bottles.  Good Luck|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	twin cribs are great! or 1 crib till they get older 1yr. then toddler beds or a full bed <br>  <br>  you dont need two of everything. It would help to have<br>  2 swings or 2 bouncers or 1 of each. and I would so get 2 playstations. so you can get things done. <br>  <br>  CHeck out <br>  <br>  craigslist.com <br>  <br>  find your state and your town <br>  its like an on line garage sale <br>  local! no shipping<br>  <br>  lots of cheap stuff! <br>  <br>  also check out yahoo groups freecycle sign up I just had a baby 9mo ago and i get lots of things people are giving away free.|`|UwhyTsCKaa	Pretty much, for the exeption of when they are older. Children get jelous easily, so its better if they have their own toy sets.. etc.|`|2gyKORCbaa	yep just about. if you need any advice on twins feel free to email me too<br>  good luck|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I would suggest buying one crib for now and putting it in your room, then they both can sleep in it.  They will need their own cribs eventually but if money is a problem just buy one for now and buy another one later on.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Haha well yea thats what my mum did! She had to get two of everything for my bro and I..literally everything! And I would get labels on the crib as to which is which..cuz my mom used to feed one of us twice, thinking it was the other one haha! So yea, it gets really confusing at first but after that you'd be able to tell them apart by their voices. good luck|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I have fraternal twins boy / girl and I did buy two moses baskets & cots & bounc chairs, car seats different clothes only because they are boy / girl.  Everything else I bought one off, actually I bought two bath seats so we could bath them at the same time but never used them just put them straight into big bath together obviously holding them.  <br>  The sleeping arrangement are entirely up to you, I know 1 person with identical twins and they share the same cot, I always seperated them so they didn't get used to being right next to the other but mine aren't identical. The only reason I did buy moses baskets is cause I couldn't fit two cots in the or room,  You only need one buggy make sure it's a double though!! <br>  Good Luck with the rest of your pregnancy.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I nanny for twins and when they were first born they slept in the same crib. They did so until the girl became more active and started to move around in her sleep and wake the boy up, around 4 months. Now they do have two cribs, but sleep in the same room. They only had one swing, as the girl didn't care for it too much. They had one play center and ended up buying another one because both kids liked it so much. Since they are identical, im not sure if you would want to buy two of all clothes, it would be cute to match once in a while, but what a waste to buy two of every outfit! You could probably stretch your budget better if you didn't do that! Good luck and congrats!!|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	Twins can share crib for a while.  A lot of parents actually do that and as long as you move one when they get too big it won't make much difference.  Then you don't have to buy two expensive pieces of furniture at the same time.  You also don't necessarily need 2 changing tables.|`|kNFH5lKnaa	Yeah, I'm a twin to be honest.<br>  Umm.. I did wore same outfits when I was little and share the same cribs back when i was small.<br>  by the time they get older, they will feel they want to  be different from each other, cause that's whats happening right now with my little brother (by 4 minutes)
x8dDKH3Maa	go with old school spellings on all of them. my opinion is that people who try too hard to be different look like weirdos and snobby...in my opinion. It's like they are BEGGING for attention..."hey everyone, look how unique my baby's name is!!!!" Plus, it will be easier to find personalized stuff for the baby and as they get older. Unless you want to pay to have things personalized, stick with the original spelling. My good friend has twin girls :Lindsay and Lauryn. I always find cute "Lindsay" stuff but can never find "lauryn" spelled like that :( <br>  Susanna, Sophia, Rebecca, Lucas, Mattias, Nicholas...those all look "normal" to me. best of luck.|`|wXxKsOI2aa	Susannah<br>  Sophia<br>  Rebecca<br>  <br>  Lucas<br>  Mattias<br>  Nicholas<br>  <br>  Lovely names by the way|`|zZ6wjO6Maa	Suzanna<br>  Sophia<br>  Rebecca<br>  <br>  Lucas<br>  Mathias<br>  Nicholas|`|181WVEyyaa	sophia<br>  rebecca<br>  lukas<br>  mathias<br>  nicholas<br>  susannah|`|9OKG0a5Baa	suzanna<br>  sophia<br>  rebekah<br>  lucas<br>  mathias<br>  nicholas|`|Ymonx5cJaa	Susanna (nick name susie)<br>  Sophia<br>  Rebecca (nick name becky or becca, also k's in this name look kind of awkward or something)<br>  Lucas (nick name luke)<br>  Mathias<br>  Nicholas (nick name nick)<br>  <br>  i like the names, isabelle (bella and izzy for short), kayleigh (kaylie, kailie......), bridget, gracie, zaiden (for a boy), seth, xavier and austin<br>  <br>  try to use more unique names, names starting with "x or z" because not a lot of people have names starting with those. try to get 2 middle names instead of just 1 to make it more unique plus if you cant decide on a first name and you have a middle name then just put one of the first names as a middle name then you'll be happy lol|`|o6ruEMVUaa	Susanna is very pretty looking, so is Sophia.

AA10615073	Ectopic Pregnancy - Symptoms<br>  <br>  An early ectopic pregnancy often feels like a normal pregnancy. A woman with an ectopic pregnancy may experience common signs of early pregnancy, such as:<br>  <br>      * A missed menstrual period.<br>      * Tender breasts.<br>      * Fatigue.<br>      * Nausea.<br>      * Increased urination.<br>  <br>  As an ectopic pregnancy progresses, however, other symptoms develop, including:<br>  <br>      * Abdominal or pelvic pain, usually 6 to 8 weeks after a missed period.4 Pain may get worse with movement or straining. It may occur sharply on one side at first and then spread throughout the pelvic region.<br>      * Vaginal bleeding that may be light or heavy.<br>      * Pain with intercourse or during a pelvic exam.<br>      * Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting (syncope) caused by internal bleeding.<br>      * Signs of shock.<br>      * Shoulder pain caused by bleeding into the abdomen under the diaphragm. The bleeding irritates the diaphragm and is experienced as shoulder pain.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of miscarriage often are similar to symptoms experienced in early ectopic pregnancy. For more information, see the topic Miscarriage.<br>  -webmd.com|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	I know that if you conceived, cramping and some discomfort is normal, so don't rule out a *normal* pregnancy. Everyone I know who has had an ectopic described it as intense pain, not minor. But I experienced cramping and pain when I was just plain pregnant. Give it another week and take a pregnancy test. It could just be implantation pain, which some people do feel. If you see a small spot of blood in the next day or two, I would more likely suspect implantation than ectopic.|`|181WVEyyaa	generally, pain on the left side means period is coming. i got pains on my right side the month i fell pregnant.<br>  BUT, theres alwways exceptions. wait till the day of your period, and take a test. <br>  gl|`|78d6ef8ee0f77ed0f7f9850021641ce6aa	i just had emergency surgery due to ectopic pregnancy a week ago. i did have extreme pain in my ovaries. i didn't feel it more on one side i felt it in the middle or all over. aches could be serious, but usually they aren't. i wasn't so lucky. to be on the safe side take a preg test or better yet get a blood test and go see a doctor ASAP. because ectopic pregnancies can be fatal. not that anything is wrong because some cramping also is a sign of a reg pregnancy or you might be getting your period, but if you are concerned it would be for your own good to ask a doctor. <br>  i don't know, but i have a feeling you'll be ok. :)<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|Pp35Swztaa	There's probably nothing to worry about.

It really sounds like what i went thru with my two pregnancies so try to relax hey?|`|XajoRVtjaa	Ectopics tend to present in one of three ways: <br>  As an emergency. Suddenly, without warning a woman is very unwell, collapses and is taken to hospital. A positive pregnancy test is found and she is transferred to theatre PDQ and a ruptured ectopic is found with bleeding into the abdomen. <br>  The second group are known to be at risk of an ectopic pregnancy, for example she may have had an ectopic previously, may have undergone tubal surgery or assisted conception (such as IVF). Early detection of ectopics are high in this group of women as we routinely check that the pregnancy is where it should be fairly early on. Less than 20% of ectopics present this way. <br>  Finally, the most common presentation is with a missed period, positive pregnancy test, some abdominal pain (usually to one side), and some irregular vaginal bleeding. Some women report fainting or shoulder-tip pain. <br>  i hope you find this useful

Avere il dono di concepire, crescere e portare alla luce un bimbo/a è semplicemente MERAVIGLIOSO anche se dobbiamo sopportare nausee, vomito ect ect.<br>  Per il parto ti rispondo con un antico detto toscano:<br>  "il parto è un dolore scordone che rimane tra il materasso ed il coltrone".<br>  E' un detto che risale a quando si partoriva il casa e significa che soffriamo ma appena ci alziamo dal letto con la nostra creatura in braccio dimentichiamo qualsiasi cosa dato che ne siamo ripagate in pieno. "scordone" significa appunto che si dimentica (altrimenti non faremmo più altri figli, no?!?) e coltrone è l'attuale piumone.<br>  Comincia pure a pensare ai nomi!!!!|`|8NeKYvlLaa	E vai!

2XTaooRlaa	Sounds like a very good chance as you were ovulating. Unfortunately there is onlt a 20% chance even if everything is done right. That is why it takes most couples a year. I hope everything works out. Good luck!|`|j9hqeBRRaa	If you had sex on Jan 28 to the 2nd then you will not be able to tell if you are preggo until at least Feb. 11th or 12th. How much "ejaculates" as nothing to do with increasing the chances of conception. It only takes one. If his sperm count is normal then everything should be o.k. Everytime a man "ejaculates" his body releases millions of sperm. If he has recently ejaculated (say one, two, or even three) days before hand, it lowers the "quality" of the sperm, but not the "quanity" <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|E9Cpx9RXaa	well from personal experience the more semen ejaculated into the more will run out once you stand or move in general it only takes one sperm to do the job  though  so good luck.|`|181WVEyyaa	always a possibility.  ill cross my fingers for ya! xxx|`|4Hc3bvJHaa	I say there is a definite possibility.

jPpSsIcmaa	bonjour!<br>  je penses que tu as eu tord de la conduire chez sa copine. Pour ce genre de faute, une simple explication ne me parait pas suffisante et tu aurais du trouver une punition. la,ca va etre pire pour elle puisque sa copine va savoir ce qui c'est passé et qu'elle va sans doute se prendre une fessée.<br>  Je pense que son pere a raison de vouloir marquer le coup et si elle recoit une fessée meme déculottée he bien tant pis pour elle|`|90cec9339b2c7808629b41dc15916eb1aa	ta fille a volé, elle doit etre punie.<br>  tu as mal géré l'affaire en la conduisant chez la copine,bon ,c'est fait, c'est pas non plus evident de penser a tout sur le moment;<br>  ton mari s'est peut etre un peu ennervé en apprenant ca et c'est logique;<br>  essaye ,si ce n'est pas trop tard, de negocier la fessée; en proposant que ce soit toi qui la donne déculottée ou lui sur la culotte.<br>  la fessée, ce n'est pas un drame si elle la recoit mais il faudra ensuite une bonne explication <br>  <br>  bon courage|`|JxjicV6vaa	Je réprouve la fessée, mais une VRAIE PUNITION s'impose.<br>  Il s'agit de lui expliquer pourquoi c'est "mal de voler". Prenez un exemple qui lui parlera : un objet auquel elle tient que quelqu'un lui volerait...  et ensuite, privez là d'une sortie, d'une distraction etc. A 11 ans, elle va très vite comprendre. La fessée ne ferait que renforcer un sentiment de "honte" et de "culpabilité" sans travailler le problème à la base. Apprenez-lui l'effort et la notion mercantile pour obtenir les choses. Cela portera plus ses fruits qu'une fessée humiliante, vexatoire mais non pédagogique.<br>  Beaucoup d'entre nous, enfants, avons commis ce genre de grosse bêtise, le tout étant de ne pas récidiver parce que l'on a eu peur, mais parce que l'on a compris qu'on ne doit, qu'on ne peut pas faire à autrui, ce que l'on ne supporterait pas que l'on nous fasse.<br>  Bon courage à vous et votre mari, ainsi qu'à la petite puce, qui ne doit pas être fière à cette heure malgré tout !|`|Z7VFpheSaa	1) Je ne l'aurais pas conduit chez sa copine<br>  2)Pas de fessée (et surtout jamais déculottée!) ......Si fessée il doit  y avoir, elle doit etre donnée immédiatement  après la betise et en aucun cas une heure après............ éviter les fesses donner plut?t les claques  derrière les cuisses....... et donnée par le père ou la mère|`|aDpWSxukaa	Là pour le coup je pense que tu as manqué de discernement (tu étais prise de court je suppose)<br>  <br>  Il ne faut jamais dire à un enfant "la prochaine fois tu seras punis", il faut punir dés la première fois!!!<br>  <br>  Attention la punition n'est pas forcément énorme, mais il faut qu'il y ait une réaction rapide, nette et précise.<br>  <br>  En l'occurrence je pense que la priver de sortie chez la copine plus un bon sermon de la part du père avec un "file dans ta chambre" (sans la fessée) aurait suffit. ( suivi un peu plus tard d'une discussion calme sur "pourquoi il ne faut pas voler".|`|ogmzW0gIaa	Je suis d'accord avec les réponses précédentes. Où est la punition ? Est-ce qu'elle a vraiment écouté ce que tu lui as dit ? Un enfant à besoin d'explications ET de faits, il a la mémoire courte quand il veut... Je pense que le père a tout à fait raison en allant la rechercher, il marque le coup. Parce que non seulement elle a fait une grosse bêtise, mais en plus elle a eu ce qu'elle voulait... Elle s'en sortait bien, non ? :)|`|q1eHlgwGaa	Je lui aurait fait une morale et surtout je ne l'aurai jamais emmené chez sa copine. C'est grave de voler et selon moi ?a doit être puni.

On comprend bien que tu le regrettes.<br>  <br>  Il faut la punir, la priver pendant le temps que vous jugerez nécessaire de ce qu'elle aime le plus (sa DS, une boum la semaine prochaine ?, la virée du samedi aprem chez une copine ?, les prochaines vacances de paques qu'elle avait prévu de passer chez sa cousine préférée ?... vous seuls pouvez juger).<br>  <br>  Le tout est qu'elle comprenne l'ampleur de sa bêtise.<br>  <br>  C'est vrai, je n'ai pas d'enfants, mais j'ai été une ado qui a fait plein de conneries et maintenant à 30 ans, je considère que mes parents, parfois sévères et je les ai détesté ont très bien rectifié le tir !|`|AKmEEsRBaa	Bravo a ton compagnon.<br>  <br>  La loi interdit ce genre de chatiment, tout comme elle interdit de voler.<br>  <br>  C'est donc en se comportant en delinquant que ton compagnon voudrait faire comprendre a ta fille son acte tout aussi delinquant ?<br>  <br>  Fais ce que je dis pas ce que je fais.<br>  <br>  Je suppose que ce n'est pas la premiere raclee que se prend ta fille.... On verra les resultats quand elle sera adulte, preparez vous a des relations cahotiques, conflictuelles, voire pas de relations|`|NXCoNLtLaa	La priver de sa sortie et des prochaines à venir me semble nécessaire. Pour ce qui est de la fessée en revanche, c'est inutile.|`|ZwAZMoJqaa	Virginie n'a pas tort lorsqu'un enfant fait une bêtise de cette ampleur le mieux et de lui faire comprendre par une punition. A cet age là, des paroles de reproches rentrent par une oreille et ressortent par l'autre. Toutefois la "fessée déculottée" n'est pas une bonne solution. Il faudrait priver de sortie ou encore d'argent de poche jusqu'à ce qu'elle regagne votre confiance progressivement.|`|a35e171973fc4e01bbabdf0a3e0279c4aa	Je suis du meme avis que les autres, une punition s'impose, son geste est mal mais la réaction du papa est mauvaise : une fessée déculotée à 11 ans? Ca ne se fait pas. A 11 ans,j'avais déjà mes règles et des poils pubiens, j'aurai très mal pris une fessée venant d'un homme, qu'il soit mon père ou non. Empêche le de lui infliger ce préjudice.

But for a healthy pregnancy, you must take folic acid/pregnancy pills Seriously,  I found this on WebMD site...lots of info there. Also,  what you could do is after your partner ejaculates have him lift your legs up in the air, but make sure your bottom is up.

MhZoP0xSaa	Yes they're stretch marks alright but only the slight ones (I unfortunately have the reddy/purple ones).  Cocoa butter cream is the trick !|`|xnOfffO4aa	Yes is perfectly normal...I didn't get any from my two pregnancy, but I've seen others with them...and it's perfectly normal|`|181WVEyyaa	yes thats ok. its the big red/purple ones u need to watch. they tear as u continue to grow. <br>  use some cocoa butter on them. or bath in baby oil.|`|36748cbfd8b4560aa422e8e953c25f9faa	yes! and that is good, cuase they wont be as noticable as the yucky red ones.. Unless.. you tan in a tanning bed, they wont get darker and they are more noticable.<br>  <br>  I am right behind you! 34 weeks.. with my second. I didn't get any with my first.. with this one, theres quite a few. I am getting them laser removed though...|`|gC0ZaMpzaa	You are very lucky its only silvery stretch marks.Maintain the colour,and its barely noticable few months after the baby is born.<br>  Eats lots of fresh fruit n veg,control the weight gained n liberal use of rich moisturiser.<br>  If the skin of your belly is being stretched at a rapid rate in the last part of your pregnancy,your silvery marks will be red n purple.|`|oQziCHbbaa	Yes it is normal. I'm only 5 months and i already have silvery ones. You are very lucky because they go away much easier after brth and are not noticeable like the red or purple ones. You should be glad
181WVEyyaa	yes i had  a blood test on tuesday, and today is a public holiday, so after the weekend, i get the results.<br>  <br>  sorry ur not preggers, it took me 3 months of trying. have u been trying long??<br>  <br>  try to pin point your ovulation, it took me a couple of months to do this, but i figured it out, around day 12-14. be sure to try every other day, not every day, so that the sperm are strong. and be sure to come so that your pelvis shakes, making the sperms swim up to the egg. i didnt believe people about that, but after a couple of months i thought "ill try anything", so i told hubby to do me good   lol. and i fell pregnant from that try. its the only time we tried in february.
f97fc2a0050a87481efc626d11ed4108aa	Well... <br>  If you are involved in a church and they are old enough to commit themselves to this choice of life style... Go for it. <br>  I would find a church and start going. If the children are into it and understand they will want to when they are ready.|`|AA10943329	you approach the church of your denomination and say you want to get it done, they will make a time. Easy, as for spelling it. It is10.40pm and my mind has gone blank of Christening,I think thats right lol|`|181WVEyyaa	christen**<br>  depends where u live<br>  in australia, u can contact the church for what eva religion u want them to be, and get some forms. u will need to think about godparents, and these days they r flexible with the procedures on the day. some call it a naming ceremony if they arent religious.|`|42tTsVuxaa	That's great! A little thought.<br>  <br>  Why do you want to get you children Christened? (I am not saying you shouldn't) is it because you were and they need to be done! tradition! Its a life long commitment for you and the God Parents. <br>  <br>  It's very easy, go along to your local church, and talk to thee Vicar, Priest, Minister (which ever church you belong too and have a chat, when we had our little boy Christened we were with the Minister for about an hour. There is no where in th Bible where it says Children have to be Christened, only adults, because of the innocents of the child they will already be accepted by God. I think its more of an conformation of the parents, God parents that you bring them up as Christians, in a correct way.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your Children|`|K0tT6JXMaa	Spelled christened. You need to contact a local church that does christening. I know Catholics do, not sure who else does that.
KSWL6mkHaa	This week of pregnancy, your baby is a little over 4 1/2 inches in length and weighs about 2 1/2- 3 ounces. Fine lanugo hair covers your baby's body and head. Gender is recognizable now during an ultrasound exam and you can also see your baby's movements and possibly the sucking reflex as your baby sucks his or her thumb.<br>  You can easily feel your uterus below your belly button and you've most likely gained 5-10 pounds by now. This would be a good time to learn to sleep on your side, since you shouldn't lie directly on your back because it can place the uterus on top of major blood vessels, which can decrease circulation to your baby. Lying on your stomach isn't a good idea either, since it puts pressure on your growing uterus. So, invest in a pregnancy pillow or a body pillow for support.<br>  <br>  For more info visit<br>  <a href="http://pregnancyguidelines.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancyguidelines.blogspot.com</a>|`|AA12254128	I believe the tighten of you belly is normal as long as you have no pains there should be no problems. But make sure you ask your doctor. good luck oh and congrats|`|181WVEyyaa	could be braxton hicks but i doubt it that early on.<br>  do u work out?<br>  i used to get tightening right after a work out.. i went to the docs and he said its fine, just dont over do it.
WtBBMl5Qaa	Try using a nursing pad underneath your bra. It will help to stop clothing from brushing up against the nipple and irritating it. <br>  <br>  Also...this may sound wierd but it is worth a try....try squeezing your breast. It will release some of the fluid that is building up in anticipation of your babies birth. It may or may not relieve the soreness but it's worth a try!|`|ITp35Wyzaa	Most pregnant women will feel some changes in their breasts. Your breasts will increase in size as your milk glands enlarge and the fat tissue increases, causing breast firmness and tenderness in the first and last few months of pregnancy. Bluish veins may also appear as your blood supply increases. Your nipples will also darken and a thick fluid called colostrum may leak from your breasts. All of these breast changes are normal.<br>  <br>  Recommendations: <br>  1. Wear a bra that provides firm support. <br>  2. Choose cotton bras or those made from other natural fibers. <br>  3. Increase your bra size as your breasts become larger. Your bra should fit well without irritating your nipples. Try maternity or nursing bras, which provide more support and can be used after pregnancy if you choose to breastfeed. <br>  4. To ease discomfort and maintain support, try wearing a bra during the night and day. <br>  5. Tuck a cotton handkerchief or gauze pad into each bra cup to absorb leaking fluid. Nursing pads, which you can buy in a pharmacy, are also available. Make sure to change these pads as needed to prevent irritation to the underlying skin. <br>  6. Clean your breasts with warm water only; do not use soap or other products since they can cause dryness.|`|181WVEyyaa	lansinoh is a cream you can buy from the pharmacy, it comes in a purple tube.<br>  its used at the end of pregnancy and while breast feeding to protect and toughen nipples. u dont even have to clean it off before breastfeeding.|`|fayUhRw3aa	put a nursing pad inside your bra, and have you tried nipple cream
ikCwYaVEaa	my son is the same age and like your son he eats at different times everyday also. he eats breakfast when he wakes up, lunch after his afternoon nap, dinner between 5 and 6 and then cereal before bed. although it's at different times, this works for me. i would just let him make his own scedule so that he can enjoy eating all these cool new foods! sounds like he's a healthy boy. you must be doing something right!!|`|181WVEyyaa	an absolute time schedule would never work. nothing goes to plan. if he is  a happy baby, then he has u to thank. just keep feeding him when he is hungry. when he is older u can try and get him used to times for foods. i think its an individual thing, all children are different, and some r just more hungry than others.<br>  keep up the good work.
KICQQxLxaa	Honestly, I only sterlizered them when I first got them.  The rest of the time I just washed them in warm sudsy water.  We do have good tap water though, so that may make a difference...|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	i always sterlize them when they are new then after that just wash them with soapy hot water.so not sure but i think anytime as long as they have been sterlized once.|`|181WVEyyaa	i stopped at 12 months. then i started washing them like all my dishes, because at 12 months they can handle  more germs, cow milk, all foods etc etc. they just have a better immunity. <br>  <br>  i wouldnt reccomend stopping at 3 months. but its your baby.|`|1GICvnk4aa	haha 5 months|`|5WuoGfroaa	I did it once before I used them, now I put them in the dishwasher cause they are dishwasher safe.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You should always sterilize bottles before you use them for the first time but do not need to sterilize them after that, just wash with hot water and soap.|`|7Jo4wdaEaa	i stoped at about 3 months<br>  also if you are using plastic bottles they should not be heated!! there is chemicals in certin plastic bottles that come out when heated! im not sure if its in every bottle though ill try to find somthing on it and get back to you if you are intrasted or you probally already heard of it...lol|`|cc2e3ed9be1a8c4f1a14697858f251e9aa	If you're really concerned, then wait till it's time to start your baby on cereal - after all, you're not going to sterilize the bowl, spoon and such.|`|waq1y3gYaa	I sterilized after every feeding for the first 2 months and then just washed with hot soapy water.

I have twins one sleeps during the day the other at night.|`|bmxtqw7saa	It depends, if she is crying I'd say about 6 and if she's happy she never wants to go to bed. But then their are times when she is calm and sleeps 10 to 13 hours. Sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and cries which take 1-2 hours away. On an average she sleeps 8-10 hours.|`|g0Szf5hgaa	My 3 month old sleeps about 8 hours at night with about half and hour in the middle for a feeding, and then he takes about 4 thirty-minute naps during the day.

qyEEFM2Daa	I think boys names are harder then girls names, but you will just have to find whats right with your surname.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think boys are a lot harder to name then girls.  I have so many girl names I love, but no boys names i feel the same about.|`|i5iOyCLdaa	I think about names for a long time. I usually get them from books and movies I like. If a name is stuck in my head for a long time, I end up using it permanently in something. For example, Darcy in my book is named after Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Also, if I can't find a way to use them, I'll add them to my extensive alias list that I use every time they ask for my name in public places. My children will probably be victims of that. <br>  <br>  But most people nowadays like to change common or semi-old names into trendy versions to make the poor innocent child "unique" (by drawing attention to the poor little dears with their odd names).|`|miFe45quaa	I agree totally! For boys, I have tons of names picked out, Luke would be number 1 :)<br>  <br>  But for girls, I would get really stuck! I think Bridget Elaina is the only name I'm sure about. <br>  <br>  Like those questions that people kept asking today "if you had sextuplets (all girls) what would you name them?" If it were all boys, it would be a piece of cake to answer! But all girls? That's a tough one!<br>  <br>  I pick names by which I like. I don't care much about the popularity. I'm more into traditional names, so I stick to that. <br>  xx|`|AA11946005	Interesting since I think boy names are harder.  I think there's more options for girls with feminine or unisex names- it's okay for a girl to have a formerly boy name like Jordan or Bailey but less acceptable for a boy to have a name that's seen as girly or wimpy.|`|4OUszQ6zaa	You just have to find one that's right for you. You also have to find a name that flows well with your last name. |`|dwOLnFnlaa	I think it's hard because there's so many that I like...|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I don't think they are because my fiance and I can only agree on 3 names, lol, so we have 3 and that is it.  He has a very long last name so they have to be short and sweet, just like our girls will be-well actually they will be tall. We picked 3 first names and the middle names will be 1-Barbara for my mother who passed, 2-Joy for my middle name and 3-May his mother's middle name if we have 3 by accident, only planning for two babies so we will just figure it out when it happens.|`|nu6Fu0lCaa	My parents liked classic names: I'm Katherine Elizabeth and my brother is Benjamin Paul.  These were both common names when we were born too.  I advise not going with the latest trend because I can tell you from personal experience that its annoying to know 20 people with the same name as you.  In every school and on every team there is always another Kate or Katie or Katelyn and it drives me nuts.  But at the same time, I don't think making up a random name is the best idea either.  Find a unique name that's been used before (I know that's contradictory).|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	LOL that's true! <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I focus mainly on girls' names, so it won't be difficult for me - I already have a few names picked out for my future girls. <br>  <br>  I have a few boys' picked out too, but my boys will more than likely get a family name, probably on his dad's side.|`|kEWUDMzUaa	i think boys are waaaaay harder to name.<br>   i have a whole long list of girls names, but like a list of 4 for boys!<br>  i suppose its down to what you think.|`|mpdSORysaa	I know. I totally agree with you. There is always a different way to name a girl. Girls i think get judged by their name more then they guys do.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	Oh, no, I have SO many more favourite girls' names than boys'.<br>  <br>  Don't think about fashion or style.<br>  <br>  Go with what you like.|`|FmdonPOUaa	That is so freaking true! Don't name your girl Terri whatever you do. |`|FpSdshiDaa	omg i know what you mean!<br>  like for a boy i have always said i will name him either David, William or Philip.<br>  <br>  but girls, there are so many names and they are all sterio-typed, so like Jade, Crystal etc all would be for strippers and Elizabeths would be nerds etc.<br>  <br>  i am naming my daughter Holly, because i feel that the name has been around for a long time, it has no rhymes that go with it, that people can tease her about, the name is short, easy to spell and pronounce and is no longer too common and it goes with our last name (Peresa)<br>  <br>  :)|`|oeEZZeQvaa	I stuck with a classic, that way I know it'll always be 'in style' so to speak.<br>  My daughter's name is Julia.

It's in both the "cute names" and the "cool names" categories at Baby Names World, which as far as I know is quite rare. It has a likeable sound, and it's been made known by certain recent pop culture figures, ergo it's gotten quite popular lately -- it's gone from outside the top 1000 names in 1990 to nearly #200 in 2007.<br>  <br>  Boone and Carlyle don't appeal. The surname-as-first name trend is definitely on the outs. I'd avoid those.<br>  <br>  Erick is cool, but why not just Erik? That's one of my top names. It's used in 5 different languages, making it a good name for a traveller.<br>  <br>  Abernathy does not have a sound that will appeal to the masses. 'Nuff said.<br>  <br>  Bristol is sooooooo associated with the Republican party. If your daughter doesn't grow up to be a Republican, she might end up not associating with/disliking her name.<br>  <br>  Christensen -- again, surnames-as-first names are now widely considered ugly. Plus, this doesn't sound feminine at all.<br>  <br>  Donna is a great name, a classic. You can't go wrong with it.|`|GJbziTG2aa	Asher: Cool.<br>  Boone: Not as cool as Asher<br>  Carlyle: Sounds like a girls name, no offence.<br>  Erick: Better than Boone<br>  <br>  Abernathy: Too long for a girl. I wouldn't a girlfriend whose name is Abernathy,sounds old, no offence.<br>  Bristol: That's cool!<br>  Christensen: Sounds long and complicated<br>  Donna: hmm, not bad, not exactly good. <br>  <br>  Can you help me?<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao2CkajXT2vYImFOGGlQE7zAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080928203820AAYXCfL">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	I actually dislike them all... sorry.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	I don't care for any of them.  Eric or Erik I prefer over Erick.|`|e4M4uQXNaa	Asher is cool, but not really something I'd give my own son as a first name.  Maybe as a middle, but as a first, it's a little feminine for me lol, especially when you start calling him Ash for short.<br>  <br>  Boone is awesome and definitely my favorite from the list.  It's modern and unusual, but not too wild or out-there; to me, it still sounds strong and very masculine.<br>  <br>  Carlyle I actually like better as Carlisle, but like Asher, it's really only a name I'd give as a middle one.  That's not because it's feminine or anything, but because I really don't like the name Carl lol which he will inevitably be shortened to.<br>  <br>  Erick is just alright to me, nothing too special.<br>  <br>  Abernathy for some strange reason or another reminds me of a pig lol.  It's definitely not something I'd use on my own kid, nor would I use Bristol.  Some place names are really cute, like Memphis or Alexandria, but Abernathy and Bristol?  Too harsh sounding and not pretty enough lol.  They're original I guess, at the very least (even though I'll bet Bristol - the name - has already gotten a bit of attention being one of Sarah Palin's).<br>  <br>  Christenson is really cool though for a girl.  Christie would be a cute nickname, and I love the sound of Christenson a lot more over the plain old Christina or Christine.<br>  <br>  Donna I actually really like, even though it screams '70's to me lol. <br>  <br>  |`|yv94euDBaa	BOYS:<br>  Asher - Okay, but on the rise. Becoming common.<br>  Boone - Your kidding?<br>  Carlyle - Prefer Carlisle. Okay.<br>  Erick - Eric or Erik. Choose one. Good name.<br>  <br>  GIRLS:<br>  Abernathy - BAD.<br>  Bristol - GROSS. Palin much?<br>  Christensen - Christen is fine.

Might as well name her Gertrude or Bertha while you are at it<br>  <br>  Bristol - This one is ok?? maybe.  The first thing I thought of when I read it was Connecticut<br>  <br>  Christensen - She would always be called Chris or Christy....as long as you are ok with the shortened versions, it's ok....cause no way is she going to go through her whole like with the long version all the time<br>  <br>  Donna - sounds ok.  All of the Donna's I've ever known were sweet and pretty, so I think that's a good name|`|jRcBr5ieaa	I'm really sorry to say that my honest response would be that I don't love any of them; Asher is a totally fine name though, just not one of my favourites.

m4amCT5waa	It's nice.  It's not overly trendy or popular (in fact it's hardly in the top 1000), so it's distinctive and unique, but it's not weird, either.  It's pretty.

Both names have a very timeless elegant feel. 8/10<br>  <br>  Ashley Scarlet: I like Scarlet over Ashley, Ashley is trendy and not as appealing as something a little bit more feminine and becoming. 5/10 Alright<br>  <br>  Zaria Gabrielle: I prefer Gabrielle Zaria if you're heartset on Zaria at all because it seems a little out of place on someone living in the US (if you are living in the US) 4/10 Not a favorite<br>  <br>  Carlie Renee: I love Carly although spelled with a 'y' using ie it seems just a little too cute and childish. Carly Renee sounds just fine, they flow well together, I like Carly Elizabeth too. <br>  <br>  ALL of your boys combinations sound better as seperate names, none of them have any type of fluidity together, sorry to say. <br>  <br>  Connor Ethan: Both are adorable names, try Connor Michael, Ethan Thomas<br>  <br>  Mathew Jonathon: Not a huge fan of either name as a first name but Jonathon Mathew has much better fluidity. <br>  <br>  Benjamin Gabriel: This name sound decent when switched but sound even better with new middle names.

0xGm3lrxaa	Nice names. Cillian is a weird name. How do you pronounce the first girl's name??|`|m7KL7dH6aa	Out of the girls name I like.. Allaire-- thats different but not too unusual.. I also like Juliana-- jules is cute for short.... And lastly Olivia-- popular but pretty Liv is a cute nickname    Boys name I like Max-- not Maxwell-- reminds me of coffe.. but max is short simple and masculine ,, other names arent my taste... hope this helps!! good luck =)|`|FZSBe7Jiaa	i ike paige but not sienna. how about paige spohia?  kenley elizabeth is also cute and different. how about kenlee, kenleigh or kenley jade  i like gavyn but spelled gavin.  and i like kahne lucas, possibly kaine|`|181WVEyyaa	for girls i love the name genevieve.i know a genevieve and she is beautiful. we call her gen.  i do like the name paige but not with ur middle name. the rest of the names dont appeal to me.    for boys i really like Nash, Lucas, elijah and westley. i wouldnt use them, but they do sound trendy. i picture good looking boys pulling these names off. nerds couldnt do it. |`|nvXAfLMCaa	Bridgette Morgan and Olivia Hazel b/c they are unique  for girls    Harland Justice is to blah but I like Emery Lewis|`|wcNdpyGbaa	Just remember when choosing strangely spelled or unique names, think of your child. How difficult will it be to learn to spell? Is it too difficult for a teacher and new friends to pronounce, causing your child embarrassment?   It's awesome to have unique children names. It shows thoughtfulness and creativity in parents, but also think of how your child would feel.    That said, for a girl I like Paige Sienna and Kenley Elisabeth, and for a boy I like Asher Phoenix and Gavyn Nicholas.  |`|SROmPst4aa	Girls-  Allaire Mae:    Not really my style.  Bridgette Morgan:    It's ok.  Candace Rae:    Cute  Genevieve Ruth:   It's ok.  Juliana Jo:    Better with 2 N's.  Kenley Elisabeth:    Cute  Lucy Ella (Luella):    Not my style.  Lorelei Rebecca:    Two first names.  Olivia Hazel:    Not my style.  Paige Sienna:    Ok.  Tierza Claire:    Like Teresa????          -Boys-  Asher Phoenix:   Don't like it.  Cillian Michael:   Don't like it.  Emery Lewis:   Emery sounds to girlish.  Gavyn Nicholas:   Spell is Gavin.  Harland Justice:   Better as Harlan  Jetson Elijah:    Jetson... are you kidding? HATE IT!  Kahne Lucas:   Not sure about the first name. Different spelling,  Maxwell David:   Cute  Nash Wendell:   I think of Nash Bridges.  Raleigh Leroy:   Raleigh sounds like a girl name.  Westley Adam:   Wesley would be better.  |`|LlXkDt24aa	i love lorelei! and paige and bridgette, all the other girls names are either plain or ugly    i like emery, gavIn, harland, jetson, westley is so cute! justice is a girls name |`|1HwmqxI4aa	love bridgette morgan! i dislike the boys names|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Haha my name is Ashley and I live in Phoenix. I like Asher Phoenix.    I like Julianna, Lucie, Paige, Gavin, and Westley. Those are all cool. The rest are a little too different for my tastes.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I'll rate them on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love).    Allaire Mae ~ 2    Bridgette Morgan ~ 7    Candace Rae ~ 9    Genevieve Ruth ~ 6    Juliana Jo ~ 4    Kenley Elisabeth ~ 4    Lucy Ella (Luella) ~ Lucy Ella = 4, Luella = 6     Lorelei Rebecca ~ 10 (Beautiful names.)    Olivia Hazel ~ 5    Paige Sienna ~ 5    Tierza Claire ~ 3     Asher Phoenix ~ 3 (I like Asher, only I prefer it as a middle name. I don't liek Phoenix.)    Cillian Michael ~ 2 (I dislike Cillian, Michael is ok, but not great.)    Emery Lewis ~ 3 (I don't care for Emery. Lewis is ok-ish.)    Gavyn Nicholas ~ 8 (Gavyn looks femine, but I love the name in general. I prefer Gavin.)    Harland Justice ~ 5 (Hate Harland, LOVE Justice!)    Jetson Elijah ~ 3 (Hate Jetson.)    Kahne Lucas ~ 3 (How do you pronounce Kahne?)    Maxwell David ~ 5    Nash Wendell ~ 1    Raleigh Leroy ~ 1 (Sorry, but Raleigh looks very feminine. and Leroy doesn't sound good with it at all. It's very hard to say!)    Westley Adam ~ 5 (I like Wesley, but not Westly. If it was Wesley Adam I'd rate it an 8.)    Individually I like:    Asher, Gavyn (but spelled Gavin), Justice, Elijahm Lucas, Adam, Sienna, Lorelei, Rebecca (but spelled Rebekah), Ella, Ruth, and Candace.    :o)   |`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	I like Candice Rae and Wesley, not Westley Adam  God bless|`|rH9cGBuRaa	Names with 2 names (parts) are too long and confusing for me  And it looks like the second name is better off as the first one  (Michael, Adam, Lucas, Ruth, Elizabeth, Rebecca etc)

Natalie's all the rage. It rose from moderate popularity up to #16 on the U.S. popularity charts in 2006. Natalia, the Russian version of this name, also is a growing hit at #94. These names are derived from a Latin name that means "the Lord's birthday."<br>  <br>  Nevaeh. Nevaeh is a name trend that caught on for no apparent reason in the early 1990s, and in 2006, it was up to #43 on the name charts. Its meaning? Nevaeh is "heaven" spelled backwards. The name is especially popular among African American parents, but not exclusively so.<br>  <br>  Nicole. Nicole's no longer the top-20 sensation that it was in the 1980s, but it's still widely used at #74. It's also a very popular middle name that complements popular names that contain the letter L (Ashley Nicole, Kaylee Nicole, and so forth). Nicole is the female form of Nicholas, which comes from a Greek word that means "victorious people." Nicolette is a less popular variation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Classic Baby Girl Names that Start with N<br>  <br>  Nancy. This quintessential Baby Boom name was popular between 1930 and 1970, and was in the top 10 in the 1940s and 1950s. These days, it's down at #326, but the name is classic enough that it doesn't sound too dated. Nancy is actually a form of the name Ann, which means "favored grace."<br>  <br>  Nora. If you're looking for a Scandinavian name that's unusual but not strange, try Nora. Originally, it comes from an Italian name that means "compassion." The similar names Norma and Noreen sound much more dated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unusual Baby Girl Names that Start with N<br>  <br>  Naomi. Naomi's actually more popular than you might think-- up to #129 in 2006, and climbing. In Great Britain, the name has been popular for quite some time. Although this name is beautiful, be warned that it is often mispronounced-- the first syllable is correctly pronounced NAY, but it's often mispronounced as NY (much to the annoyance of the author). Naomi is a Biblical name from the Book of Ruth that means "pleasant."<br>  <br>  Nina. Nina's always been a moderately popular name that's never become trendy. Like Naomi, it's often mispronounced (as NY-nah instead of the correct NEE-nah). Nina comes from Spanish expression that means "girl."<br>  <br>  Nadia. Like Naomi, this Russian name is quickly climbing the American charts-- up to #188 in 2006. Nadia comes from a Russian name that means "hope." The French version of this name is Nadine.<br>  <br>  Nyssa. This unusual Scandinavian name means "little fairy or elf." Doctor Who fans will recognize this as one of the companion's names.<br>  <br>  Noelle. This unusual name becomes a bit more widely used in December, for obvious reasons. The masculine form, Noel, is also sometimes used for girls.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|TVx4iWlGaa	I know some people who moved here from Serbia and their daughters name is Nella.

vpL67nETaa	well, they should be checking your HCG.<br>  <br>  <br>  if its not increasing, and the hearbeat doesn't show at the next ultrasound, they'll liekly declare it a miscarriage or blighted ovum, and might give you time or drugs to miscarry, and if that doesn't happen, they'll offer a D&C<br>  <br>  I'm wishing you the best of luck|`|3gXQPso5aa	then if you are too far along they give you a d&c and you try again|`|nlteggWIaa	if they don't find a heart beat they will ask someone else to scan you if they both say there isn't one then a doctor will see you and tell you your options . they will ask you if you want to miscarry on your own ( but that could take weeks ) they can give you a pill to make you contract and miscarry ( this only has about a 70% sucsess rate ) or a D&C this is a small op to remove the pregnancy i had one on monday after losing my baby at 12 weeks  . you are only in a day very little pain after and not alot of bleeding . i hope  you and the baby are  ok good luck all the best x|`|V3J1sf8raa	You didn't say how far along you are, but it is possible that they just couldn't pick up the heart tone yet. But unfortunately, you are exhibiting signs of spontaneous abortion or (miscarriage). Just stay strong what ever happens. Know that the Lord is in control. Humans are not good reproducers. God made us that way. God knows that if he allowed the fetus to be born, it could have severe problems and possibly even kill you. Stay strong. Good luck.|`|AA10728216	well i havent been in your situations but i really believe that cramping cant be a  good sign. i suggest you ask your doctor any questions you have and specially if its something that if bugging not only your hear but your body as well. <br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck :)|`|UGRhOZvtaa	I don't think they usually can hear the heart beat until like around 6-8 weeks?.   Not positive, don't stress just yet, think positive!!  Good luck!!    how far along are you?
3dNP7Smwaa	a blood test can tell 7-10 days after ovulation. it is possible to feel something that early, many people will tell you it's not on here. i felt pregnant the day after conception. i'm three weeks pregnant right now. if you think you're pregnant, wait long enough to take the blood test. good luck!|`|7KIVaBrIaa	The earliest you can test is 5 days before your period is supposed to arrive. Its almost impossible to know now. Good Luck though.|`|9jidaKK3aa	yep, I  think about a week before your next period arrives too.<br>  <br>  If you're really that scared and think there might have happened something you should have gone to your gynocologist. Your gynocologist can give you the pill after in that case what stops you from getting pregnant|`|EZZBkpOBaa	clear blue from asda that tells u only 2 days after yr period and i do not no about the morning after pill hope things work out 4 u in the way u want them to|`|GAlD3P5baa	It's too soon to test. I don't think you're pregnant.|`|RTmmfaPqaa	After three days, not that I know of, you would have to have implantation first and the symptoms of pregnancy do not start until that happens. For some women like myself with irregular periods, I thought I was having a light period but it was implantation.  The soonest would be a few days before your period but that is for women who have a hcg level of 15 or more, you may or you may not get a good reading.  You could get a blood test that has an hcg level of 5 which it can pick up.|`|bs6tlzwbaa	No; the fastest is 5 days before your missed period.|`|bb98f7a156f1ef793e7e330a23f87df6aa	You can get a blood test done by your doctor. It can show up on a blood test at around a week.
j0VNrxJNaa	you could try made-up names like:<br>  Tefela<br>  Teffalyn<br>  Teffansyn<br>  Clateffa<br>  Tefandra (or Tephandra)<br>  Tefine (Tephine, Tephein, Tephan)<br>  Tyfann/ Tyfanndra<br>  <br>  or you could make it just teff ( i don't know if you want this) but the full name could be:<br>  Stephanie<br>  Teffaylyn<br>  Tephera<br>  Tephel (ph fronounced as f)<br>  Tefal<br>  jewish:<br>  Tehila (add an "f" name after it such as Franchesca)<br>  Temima (")<br>  Tehora (")<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :-)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Tiffany|`|FidZNMmUaa	Steffani|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Stefanie or Tiffany |`|a4YgHXRHaa	mmm...i would say "Teffinyah" (Teff-i-ny-ah)|`|AA10325228	 Tiffanny|`|miFe45quaa	I think Teffi is fine the way it is! I learned from this website:<br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/character-names.php" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/character-names.php</a><br>  <br>  That you really, rarely use the character's FULL name.<br>  You could avoid using her full name...it would also be less confusing for the reader. <br>  <br>  I was thinking of Tiffany...maybe the spelling Tiffani?

jwpwV0r3aa	Mira, yo estoy completamente de acuerdo con El Gera y aquello que tiene su horario invertido, alguna vez tambipen me ha ocurrido con mi hijo mayor, pero gracias a Dios mi madre que vivía conmigo me supo orientar muy bien.<br>  <br>  Lo primero que tienes que hacer es hacerle pasar un día muy ocupado, vale decir organizas sus horarios de comida como siempre y los entre tiempos lo haces jugar bastante impidiendo que haga siesta por la tarde, al caer la tarde le das su última cena del día, lo ba?as y si deseas le pones manzanilla en el agua de ba?o, puedes preparar una esencia en una ollita peque?a con manzanilla fresca o si no consigues puedes usar la que venden en cualquier supermercado, de esas filtrantes calculas unos 10 sobres y lo mezclas con su agua de ba?o, luego verás que no resistirá el sue?o. Le das su leche y como te aconsejó Paulo le vas hablando que es la hora de dormir, haces que se despida de quienes estén casa y lo acuestas.<br>  <br>  Si se despierta buscando tu atención, mi madre aconsejaba no encender la luz y sólo revisar si está mojado al tacto, no le dices nada absolutamente así busque de reirse contigo o algo no tienes que ceder, el bb tiene que entender que es hora de dormir, si está sucio su pa?al lo cambias a media luz, creo que a estas alturas debes ser una experta cambiando pa?ales, por tanto no necesitas de luz para hacerlo, si te es posible no enciendas nisiquiera la lámpara sino con la luz que cuela del pasillo y puerta junta ?me explico?, si notas que sigue despierto, no lo cargues y sólo le empiezas a hacer algunos cari?os sin hablarle, puedes sobarle la espaldita pero no lo saques de su cuna. NO CEDAS, los bebes siempre tratarán de manipular a sus padres si notan que pueden manejarnos, por ello aunque no te sea fácil tienes que ser fuerte. Si se vuelve a despertar, entonces ya no vas tú sino tu esposo y que haga exactamente lo mismo que te indiqué antes, verás que lo lograrán.<br>  <br>  Tienes que formarle el hábito diariamente y que comprenda que la noche es para descanzar, verás que todo se resolverá y tu bb dormirá tranquilo toda la noche.<br>  <br>  Tal vez necesites despertarlo temprano para empezar este nuevo ciclo que te estoy proponiendo porque de hecho que si está despertándote por la madrugada tantas veces entonces él debe estar durmiendo más por la ma?ana. Procura que su día inicie a más tardar 7 de la ma?ana.<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva mi consejo, ya que a mí me funcionó muy bien con mi hijo mayor, logré al poco tiempo que durmiera temprano, luego de toda esta rutina a más tardar estaba durmiendo a las 7.30 de la noche y se despertaba a las 6 ó 7 de la ma?ana.<br>  <br>  Dios bendiga tu familia|`|B3QipuMhaa	estimada colega,,, te digo asi por ke yo soy un papa de una peke de un a?o y 3 meses,,,<br>  <br>  colega,,, mi bebe ha pasado a su corta vida por una serie de "etapas" segun nos comenta un amigo terapeuta,,, ademas tambien por gracia de amistad de mi esposa, ella conoce a un dr de medicina alternativa, ke tiene una especialidad en psicologia infantil o algo asi,,,<br>  <br>  asi ke te imaginaras ke el primer semeste de vida de la bebe (y como es la primera), nada mas tosia y corriamos al dr, jaja, ke tiempos<br>  <br>  al paso del tiempo y con los consejos de los ke se dicen saber,, jaja, nos dimos cuenta ke toma mucho tiempo en ke un bebe se adapte al mundo exterior, y aun mas tiempo en ke se adapte a nuestras vidas,,,,<br>  <br>  mi consejo para ke el bebe duerma bien toda la noche, y es lo ke nosotros hacemos,,, es darle un buen ba?o 1 hra antes de dormir,, si lo pones en ba?era, pon un chorrito de alcohol dentro y diluirlo, despues del ba?o nosotros tenemos unas gotitas ke nuestro amigo nos dio, no es medicina, son naturales asi ke no hacen da?o,, creo ke se llaman Dormidol, o algo asi,, le damos 2 goteros, incluso a mi peke le gusta,,,<br>  <br>  y despues le ponemos su pijama y comenzamos a decirle ke ya es noche, ke ya tiene ke dormir,,, procuramos bajarle a la tele, apagar luz, ke el vea ke ya no hay ritmo de vida,,,<br>  <br>  una vez dormido, procurar ke su ambiente de dormir sea optimo, poca luz, no mucho ruido,, posicion comoda de el bebe,,, y sobre todo, ke duerma ya en su habitacion solo...<br>  <br>  si se despierta en la noche,,, intenta descubrir por ke fue,, puede ke sea el frio, se atoro en las cobijas, un ruido lo desperto,,, lo ke sea,,, y deja unos segundos para observar si vuelve a conciliar el sue?o,, si no es asi,,, acompa?alo y arrullalo, pero no sigas su juego de caminar,, ir a otro lugar, levantarse de la cama,, por ke se le va el sue?o,,,<br>  <br>  pues es lo ke te puedo aconsejar<br>  <br>  esto debe ser diario, hasle una rutina nocturna,, ke se le haga costumbre y ke marken las cosas la pauta,,, o sea, ke cuando se ponga pijama sepa ke ya es noche,,, ke si esta en la cama es por ke tiene ke dormir,,<br>  <br>  ya ke si observas ke ni asi se le kita en un tiempo considerable, si te recomiendo ke acudas a algun especialista,,, <br>  <br>  y en cuanto a ke el peke tenga dolor,,mmmmm pues yo creo ke si tuviera dolor los primeros sintomas de un bebe son llorar por no saber expresar ke le duele, y fiebre,,, ten un termometro a la mano<br>  <br>  espero haber podido ayudarte..<br>  <br>  suerte|`|JRgzWqB3aa	Lluviaaz:<br>  <br>  Verifica con el

dormir,igual es que le esta saliendo alguna muela y tiene dolor,si es asi le llevas a la pediatra para que le de algo,pero si no llora es que no tiene dolor,por lo tanto insiste en llevarle a su cama.<br>  Besos y suerte,piensa que si tiene dolor,lo tiene igual en su cama que en tus brazos,por lo tanto si llora es que tiene algo.

ApyrV5J9aa	Well, you're on birth control so your chances are already extremely slim.

kHk8rS5Xaa	i used the same with both. i just heard if the car seat was in a car accident then you shouldnt use it 
gpuyAKhSaa	You can reuse a car seat from your child for another of your children, but it is not recommended that you use a used car seat from a friend, relative, or consignment store. The reason is that you know the car seat history fo a car seat you used 100%. You don't want a car seat that may have been recalled, or that may have been in accident, or that may not have all the pieces. Also, if you own it you know how it was stored. You don't want to use a car seat that was stored in a garage or attic because the heat can make the plastic of the car seat structurally unsound.
bd206b850f2fec243858724c57950888aa	I was told to just keep my bladder full for the day of the ultrasound.  My baby actually had his legs crossed, so the tech poked my belly a few times to get him to open his legs and then she told us what the sex of our baby was.  It really is luck and no food or water will keep your baby in a position to see his/her genitals.|`|8051092d1ee3157bc1cf451a31222966aa	You will  have to be on your back during the ultrasound. I didn't drink anything and they were able to determine the sex of my baby. I had asked if I needed a full bladder and they said no since I was 20 weeks. If you will be in your 20th week, they shouldn't have a problem seeing, unless of course he/she does have the legs crossed, in that case there really isn't much you can do, drinking apple juice/sweet stuff can actually cause the baby to be too active and he or she wil be moving too much for them to see/measure things they need to or for them to tell the gender.|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	I have heard all kinds of things, it really just depends on whether or not the baby decided to cooperate. With my first, it was obvious, with my second, I had to roll around on the table before she would open her legs enough to see. You should ask the doctors office when they call to confirm your appointment, they will know what really works. <br>  <br>  *Edit: I am with the other poster, I have always had to empty my bladder before the scan.|`|kgSBcnRaaa	I had a gender determining ultrasound at 19 weeks.  I was told 30-45 mins before my appointment to eat or drink something with sugar.  I drank a half can of mountain dew which I never drink soda and he was very active.  They had no problem finding out.  <br>  They did have me lay on my side and poke my baby just to get better views of his face.  But we seemed to have no problem viewing any part of him.<br>  I was told to use the bathroom before my ultrasound so I was comfortable during the session.  I did not need a full bladder.  I think that is only true for old equipment.|`|fvmKx667aa	I have never heard of that. I didnt do anything and she was willing to work with it. They did my scan for a little over an hour so had plenty of time for baby to move if hiding. They will have you change positions on the table to try and get to move if they cant see. How far along will you be?<br>  <br>  *edit* I keep hearing that on here about your bladder needing to be full. They always make me empty my bladder before ultrasound and I have been able to see perfectly fine. Weird.|`|TO1gE3Qhaa	I had an ultrasound at 18 weeks and the baby wouldnt move hardly at all so they couldnt check for gender. I didnt want that to happen again so I just drank a little bit of Dr. pepper and then on my way there drank ice cold water. He was moving so much the tech. could hardly get good pictures lol. It was fun though and it took awhile longer but taht was just more time I got to see him. But he did show us that he was a boy! <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|ovfGxh3haa	im 17 weeks and had a scan a few days ago, we could all clearly see the baby's gender! i didnt take/drink anything before the u/s, just spoke to my baby the night before and asked him to be on his best behaviour so we could get a good look, it worked!! LOL!|`|iyRWN59Xaa	I don't know about that other than your bladder has to be full.|`|vNKLhNbJaa	Drinking apple juice will not make the baby do one thing or another.  I even tried to eat chocolate in the waiting room to get him moving!  Didnt work.  But, we were lucky enough that he cooperated and gave us the full monty. lol  Definately a outtie not an innie. lol<br>  Good Luck and congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|lXTA58vsaa	i would try anything i heard, we couldn't tell at our's and let me tell ya for the 1st couple days i was in shock it was a boy, not that i had it in my head for a girl just the not knowing so yes i would try it can't hurt|`|Leda2ha0aa	I think that would be a myth.  It totally depends on how your child is positioned and if they are active at the time.  Sometimes the tech is able to make it so the baby will show something.  Whatever you do, don't overdo it on the liquids.  I did the first time and the tech had me go to the bathroom because I was in agony.  You will be laying on your back the whole time and an extremely full bladder does not make it comfortable.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Apple juice has nothing to do with it. That's funny.<br>  Every thing depends on baby, period. It also depends on how far along you are. If you are over 18 weeks you will probably see the "signs".<br>  <br>  I see by your due date that it may be iffy. I hope you get to see it. The tech will try several angles so keep hoping.<br>  |`|mBeGdFO2aa	Drink a lot, they recommend a lot of water.  The u/s tech will advise you which way to lay if they can't see properly.<br>  <br>  So this is a doctor's u/s?  Don't be too heartbroken if they can't tell :) <br>  <br>  I had my dr's u/s and they couldn't tell.  It's all about the measurements and then they take some time at the end for gender determination, but not that much time. <br>  If you need to, go to a private clinic.  they dedicate the whole visit to you and seeing the baby.  It was so much better than the dr's u/s, which was very boring (45 min long) until the very end when she let me see the monitor.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	Okay! - i went for a gender ultrasound at 17 weeks. The tech told me that i should eat a meal and have caffeine about an hour before my appointment. Thats what i did. Specifically i went to hardees and got a sandwhich/fry meal and a med soft drink. My baby was VERY cooperative. Try that - Its not the apple juice that you need to drink i believe its the caffeine from the juice. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|OJFz0LBZaa	im also going for my scan on the 11th november and i have heard that as well the baby will be more active if you drink sweet fruit juice and lay on your left side for a hour, not sure if it does work or not, your a day ahead of me let me know if it works lol x|`|YrK7S8xtaa	lol, no its pretty much pot luck
yU0dp5HDaa	She could be pregnant, she could just have a weird period this month. Once she is done bleeding, have her take a pergnancy test. |`|NXKQPcPIaa	She could just have an irregular cycle. This sounds like breakthrough bleeding. Does she have regular periods and does she start on time? If this is the first time she is experiencing this it would also not be abnormal. Stress can change a cycle. If she is cramping  it is probably her period. If not, she should take a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. If she is worried she is pregnant and it is negative she'll probably have a heavier breakthrough in a few days. My guess is she'll start next week. Breakthrough periods (lt. pink spotting ) usually precede a heavy period the next week. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|azcEyojGaa	not pregnacy of course she can proably have an infection..|`|OAnyhXDVaa	That happened to me as well when I found I was 6 weeks pregnant with my son go get a pregnancy test. Make sure she doesn't drink any water or juice. Morning urine is the best urine to test with.
wLhcRPUOaa	Honey, I have severe migrains that I have never had. I am 14 weeks and 5 days today. They started a couple weeks ago for me as well. It could mean dehydration. Drink a bottle of water and take 1 8 hour tylenol. That is what the hospital told me when I went in for the headaches.|`|PBivGxuyaa	I had really bad headaches while pregnant.  Only thing i could do was take Tylenol with caffeine.  You are allowed 1-2 servings of caffeine while pregnant.|`|BEP4GRORaa	Drink a ton of water!  Drink all that you can and take Tylenol. That is the only pain medication you can take while pregnant.|`|clVuMLWKaa	Yes. It is absolutely normal.|`|A6GRX4wAaa	I am almost 13 weeks pregnant, and I was the same, they got some bad and interferred with my day to the point that I couldn't function right. I went to the doctors and I was dehydrated. I have been drinking alot more and the headaches seemed to have vanished...
jhPO37kpaa	You won't annoy your doctor. They know that this is the biggest change in your life that you will endure and you will have millions of questions. Sounds like it might be a pinch in your sciatic nerve. Does it almost feel like you are stepping on an electrical cord and it is shocking you up the one side?? Either way- call you doctor. it is important that he/she is aware of any changes/feelings that occur anyhow. Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS- misscarriage is accompanied with blood so don't panic yet|`|bha4ROR1aa	I read that could POSSIBLY be a sign of miscarriage.  Hopefully it isn't but I would call your doctor right away.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	if worried i would call your doctor, but it could be nothing other than the baby laying on a nerve as that can cause sharp pains in your back and front, i would not worry about a mc as that is normally painfull cramps low down and not up by your hip bone, i as you know are the same weeks as you and also get all sorts of sharp pains here and there even if i have been sitting for awhile and if i get up to quick or something |`|Xc02z608aa	I'd go to see a doctor....I experienced similar pains...it actually felt like a kidney infection just because of where the pain was located.  It turns out that a ligament was the source of my pain and after a week of rest everything was fine but I would definately go see a doctor.
Iq0ZW0vVaa	Usually in your first pregnancy it's closer to 18 weeks, but then in subsequent pregnancies it can be as early as 12 weeks.....<br>  Chances are, if you think you feel it, then you are.....<br>  congratulations!|`|AA10907434	That could be what you felt.  I always felt my babies early on.  Your weight shouldn't have anything to do with it.  My little ones always felt like something was lightly flicking me in the same spot repeatedly and then it would disappear.  Congrats.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	yes, more like constant flutters.|`|UUysEV0yaa	I felt my baby "move" when I was 14 wks- it felt like having butterflies in your tummy but further down.<br>  <br>  Im a slim build so maybe it helped to feel the baby early, I dont know.<br>  <br>  At 16 wks it is definately possible to feel the baby move, but you should feel the baby further down not underneath your rib cage just yet.<br>  |`|wNEdi1IDaa	its definitely possible that you felt the baby move. |`|E0gm0mRBaa	for a first pregnancy, you'd be able to feel slight kicks between 16-18 weeks. earlier for 2nd and so on pregnancies.|`|no9N3zjMaa	You sure can. I felt my baby around 15 weeks and I loved it. It'll almost feel like you have gas bubbles in your tummy or butterflies. Congrats|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	Yes it is. I felt flutters around that time! Good luck and congrats!
5e91281ac09fac3996686a8bcd4bcf58aa	I am sorry to say I had it throughout and it was excrutiatinly painful at times. I found it was worse if I got cold so my advise is to try and avoid getting cold at all costs, I found tucking in a pure wool scarf over my boobs and under my coat when I went out helped prevent it.... it looked a bit stupid but anything to avoid that pain.     I really hope it doesn't continue for you or you can prevent it in future.|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	I don't think you can do very much. They're just growing, probably, and it's hormones. A hot shower might help for a while. And a good support bra.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	It sometimes has something to do with the sexual hormones.  Try as the other poster said with a warm cloth, or shower.  That would be about it that you could use, so you are not having something that will affect the baby.|`|cstMkEC3aa	I think it just depends on you, I had it my entire pregnancy and I found running a hot shower over them, or even placing a warm wash cloth on them helped sometimes. But in all reality there is not to much you can do. Sorry! Best of luck to you!!|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	use a warm towel 
c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Depends on the baby and whether or not it's breastmilk or formula.  Very young babies eat every 2 to 4 hours.  Older babies every 3 to 5.  I nurse exclusively but I keep a days worth of bottles on hand.  Thats 10 to 12 for my 2 month old.  12 is probably on the safer side if you only want to wash bottles once a day.  Anewbornwill eat about 2 ounces at a time every 2 to 3 hours.  Feeding will increase by amount and space in time eventually, so to start you will need more, but by 3 montha or so you might only need 6 to 8.  Also, make sure you have a nipple and bottle brush and a few replacement nipples.|`|Ud871v3paa	i bought the starter kit but never used any.|`|jNErU39iaa	My daughter is breast fed, but when I have to go somewhere - i express into Avent freezable bottles first, so I can freeze them in advance and just take them out when i need them. At the moment i have 6 bottles in the freezer with 180ml of breast milk in each of them<br>  But i have a heap more bottles (probably 15) just waiting to be filled up!|`|LhvKTYftaa	hmm..well I use drop ins and have 9 4oz bottles and about 8 8oz ones.  I used the same nipples as I wasnt using 8oz bottles when I used the 4oz ones!!<br>  <br>  10 should be fine for now!!|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i have 9 in total but we only use the 6 glass ones. the other 3 are put away because i couldnt return them but they have bpa in them... maybe... not sure but not taking the chance|`|ETthFRBEaa	10 is good perfect i use to put water in all my bottles then when i needed one i would only have to add powder good luck|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Yep. All having lots of extras does is allow them to sit longer between washings and breed harmful bacteria. I had 6 6 oz ones, and when my daughter started drinking more we threw out the small ones, she had 5 bigs ones we used until we threw them out. <br>  Of course, we washed them every day, or two as she got older, we'd let them soak in soapy water between washings. <br>  Good luck! |`|WxQFe0GYaa	I have six.  I thought about getting more, but I'm fine with having a maximum of six to wash at any one time.  There are inevitably times that I don't wash them until they are all dirty, and that sucks.|`|6Rw7COSoaa	Most definitely- I have 9 and my baby is 10 months old. She is on 4 bottles a day. A younger baby may be on 5-6 a day. So you have plenty- plus extra, just in case!|`|WjMPCEs5aa	i have 6..it seem to be enough..you really don't need to many cos they should be washed (the use bottle) after each feed or by the end of the day. so there is always a clean bottle...|`|rdbRGWfzaa	i have 9...I pre-make her formula and have them ready to go for feedings....9 lasts me 24 hours usually.  so I would say 10 is a good amount|`|ZCSIrQduaa	I have 5 and I am constantly washing them. BORING!|`|AA11466534	We have 4|`|aWU6YCH3aa	I now have 0!! My son is off the bottle!!!|`|9436e2092a447a7fb73dc09932ee58a8aa	10 is a good number... the way i look at it is the more you have the more you wash!! get my drift!! lol 10 is a good amount ...|`|4zwGCcKAaa	With my son, we had 12 or so. With my daughter, we had 8. 
hr6ii9o0aa	I have nothing to add except that pregnancy doesn't have "symptoms."  It's not a disease or a chronic condition.  |`|kG6VWsGvaa	It differs for every woman. You don't even need to experience any of those to be pregnant. They're just somewhat common symptoms.<br>  <br>  I'm gonna say the earliest you can experience pregnancy symptoms at all are about 4-6 weeks.|`|fjeFBGlqaa	bout 5-6 weeks|`|lWbchmJuaa	They can occur as early as the first month! They can occur differently for everyone!<br>  Keep in mind that the symptoms that you described can also be P.M.S.<br>  They can be difficult to distinguish. <br>  If you suspect that you are pregnant, please see a doctor if you haven't already done so.<br>  I hope that this helps. Good luck to you!|`|10237fa7f63a19efe73f3fb4f3d3753aaa	My breasts were sore even before my missed period. Thankfully, i didn't experience constipation and haven't heard many women complain about that during pregnancies. The water retention most often occurs toward the end of pregnancy.|`|NQwKQYn3aa	I got sore breats around 4 weeks prego, constipation same time but havent retained water
nN4VKGYJaa	Yes, You get to decide what traits are most important to you. Banks may have infancy, childhood or even adult photos of the donor to help you choose. You may wish to match hair and eye color or ethnic origin. Most clinics offer consultation (either free or for a price) to help you find your perfect match.|`|XydHvcqJaa	You pick from profiles that match what you want. You can ask for specific ethnicities , hair color, eye color, hieght, intelligence.
bHgQ91Kbaa	That's stupid.  You should not have to wake a poor baby up every three hours to eat.  When she is hungry she will wake up.  When in the world did people start thinking it was nec to wake a healthy baby every 3 hrs on the dot to eat?  That is insane unless your baby is either a very small preemie, or failure to thrive.  <br>  <br>  If your baby is healthy she will wake up when she is hungry, then you allow her to eat until she is full.  I swear these so called experts don't have a freaking clue what they are talking about.  My babies were all fed on demand.  If they were hungry I fed them, if they slept 4-5 hours no problem, just kept a close eye on them if they slept longer than I was comfortable with, but I NEVER woke them up to feed.<br>  <br>  Baby's are all unique, and they go through periods of physical growth and mental growth.  When they are in a physical growth spurt they sleep more because all the energy is going in to growth.  When they are in a mental growth spurt they will be much more alert and sleep less, often or in shorter spurts, and they eat what they need, as much as they need.    <br>  <br>  I would inform the daycare that they are not to wake her every 3 hrs to eat, and just feed her when she is hungry.  If it is 4-5 hrs, yes, wake her, but not every 3 hrs, sheesh.   Believe me she will let you or them know when she is ready for a clean diaper or food.  |`|O9MGxS6yaa	congratulations on your beautiful little bundle of joy!!!:) I asked my doctor this very same question after having my son, and the doctor, (a mother of 3), told me that in the beginning the baby needs to eat every 2 hours to make sure that your milk is coming in correctly and so that the baby is getting enough to grow. As soon as the baby makes a healthy weight gain your doctor will probably tell you its alright to go longer between feedings. but the baby should never go more than 3 throughout the day at that age. at nighttime its a different story because then they need their sleep and so do you! so let them sleep as long as they want. but in the day, if you go long amounts of time without feeding, your breasts might make less milk...mine did because i was feeding every 2 hours, then sometimes 3, then sometimes 4 and they simply slowed down the milk production. props to you little mama for breastfeeding!!!<br>  *Why thumbs down?*|`|AA10728216	oh wow 7 weeks is too little to go to daycare... but well its ur choice and i wont question it... i feels like i wouldnt want to leave my baby on a daycare just yet lol <br>  my baby is almost 6 weeks now and she wakes up alone, our doc told us that i have to feed her on demand, whenever she wants to as much as she wants to. ive had no problems with that, shes growing up nicely :P  <br>  <br>  my baby wakes up around every 3-4 hours when she eats around 4 oz and every hour when she eats only 2  |`|6D4wSKriaa	I don't think it's necessary, she'll wake when she's hungry. Let the poor little thing sleep.|`|AA11194918	My best advice is to wake your baby to be fed during the daytime and let her sleep as much as possible during the night.  As long as she is a normal healthy 7 week old, who has already gained back her birth wait + more, don't wake her for a night time feeding.  This orients the baby to the idea of night and day.   She will learn that daytime is for eating and night time is for sleeping.  She should be getting most of her nutrition during the day.  This way she will develop good sleeping behaviors and patterns. |`|jhdjX6iWaa	This has everything to do with convenience for the daycare and nothing to do with what is right for your baby.  Ask them to explain the reasons why they do it, if their answer is that it fits their schedule, ask yourself if this is the type of daycare who puts your daughters needs first. If you are unhappy, speak to a supervisor and explain that you would like  things done a different way, as you are not comfortable with the 3 hour rule. If they refuse you gotta ask yourself a question or two! Never feel bad about asking daycare for an explaination.  Your baby is the most important thing in the world.|`|Wjo2X9LRaa	Ok. Your daughter shouldnt be woken up to be fed... She will eat when she is hungry. I have a preemie. He was woken up until he was 5 1/2 pounds. Then I was told to feed at will. So in other words, let him tell me when he is hungry! I would tell them not to do that. They keep babies on a schedule when they are in the NICU so that they will gain weight. If your child isnt having problems gaining weight and eating, then I would tell them stop... |`|AA11465739	By the time my daughter was a about 2 weeks old she would wake us up on her own. She knew when she was hungry. By the time she was about 3 1/2 months she was sleeping through the night.  I would think that at 7 weeks she probably has a good idea when she's hungry or not. |`|SDr9Y7Zyaa	A baby should never be woken from their sleep...not that it would do harm but a baby will not fight the need to be fed, but they will fight their naps when they are overtired.<br>  She will not allow herself to starve.|`|5cWCn9HLaa	She needs to eat every 3 hours. YAY! SHE STILL SLEEPS and is 7 weeks old. Enjoy it while you can. |`|zYvLNT09aa	i dont believe a baby should be woken up to fed.if the baby is hungry he or she will let you know|`|IXBl5l5kaa	At this age your baby should feed when she wants to feed. Every 3 hours is no indication of baby's hunger. We stopped waking my baby to feed after 1week. At that point she woke herself. <br>  <br>  The only time I wake my baby now is when I get home from work at 2am so that my supply will have help with baby-to-breast and so she'll sleep longer for my sake. She is 3 months<br>  <br>  I would request them stop doing that.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	personally i don't think a baby should be woken to eat unless they are preemie and have to... no baby is going to allow itself to starve. she will wake up when she is ready to eat.
qC6wsGamaa	You should tell your doctor. <br>  I would suggest that you might be allergic, or having an adverse reaction to Depo.....<br>  I was on Depo for 4 years, and let me tell you one thing you may not know....It promotes tumor growth in your uterus and in your other female regions.  Be careful what you do to your body to ensure not getting pregnant, when it can cause cancer. Severe bone loss... we already have problems with this later in life, this is going to create a worse problem.<br>  <br>  Educate yourself on this before having it done again, please.<br>  I don't mean to alarm you, I just don't think that people take this warning literally enough. I would rather not have sex at all, than have had to go through the treatment for cancer I just underwent.  So I am just trying to let you know ahead of time what you can expect for long term usage.<br>  <br>  Good Luck sweetie!|`|Hz5ZCYIAaa	when the next shot is due, the last starts wearing off, it all depends on your hormone levels when u get a period but if i was a couple of weeks late with my next injection i would get a period.

IyPPBkCHaa	First of all, big hugs to you.  I was told they could not find the heartbeat and I am now 31 weeks pregnant with a very healthy and extremely active baby.  I would go get another Ultrasound.. sometimes the dates could be off.  Good luck!|`|khyidQeaaa	I miscarried with my baby at 4 1/2 weeks so there was difinatly no heart beat, but this time around i heard my sons heart beat at 6 weeks. I do hope everything is ok but at 8 weeks tha baby should have a heart beat and they should be able to detect it during an ultrasound. Best of luck fingers crossed everything is ok!!

j7UQUgTAaa	maybe ur only "late"<br>  and you're almost sort of scaring yourself into thinking its something else?? if ur concerned, go to the doctor.. i'm guessing that would be the best thing to do.|`|4jBK95d1aa	Your pregnancy hormone may not be high enough. Take another test in a week and if nothing then but same symptoms see a doctor.|`|AA12030967	well you could just be stressing about it and your body might be bloated, sometimes when you're worried yo uget those symptoms...<br>  <br>  but if you want a quick way to really find out, schedule a physical with your doctor, you have to pee in a cup anyway to be checked. you know without 10 minutes for real.|`|RoQye1O0aa	Stress can definetly cause a missed period.  Cramping and soreness of the breasts are common  ailments of most women experiencing pms. I personally get soreness every period!!<br>  <br>  Usually in the first monthes of pregnancy a woman will lose a little weight. You may be bloated, and just having pms.<br>  <br>  And how would you know what being pregnant feels like? Have you been pregnant before?<br>  <br>  I don't know what test you have taken, but try the test that is supposed to detect the hormone before your missed period. If all else fails, see your family doctor.|`|Tmf9CgZhaa	You could always try another test after a few more days or so or you could go see your doctor. He/she may do another urine test but should also do a blood test and that will give you an accurate answer.
EcAW67QLaa	Yes that's normal you have discharge throughout your whole pregnancy so i wouldent worry about it, I did it with my son when i was pregnant with him and my doctor told me that it was normal. I hope everything goes well with you and the baby and congrats on the baby.|`|QvVUCkc9aa	I'm pretty sure it's normal...it doesn't necessarily happen to everyone, but as long as there's no blood in it, I think you're probably okay.  If you feel uneasy about it, definately talk to a doctor or nurse to make sure.|`|TYHnRJy4aa	oh thats nothing. it will get worse as time gose on.<br>  discharge is just one of the many things that comes with pregnancy.|`|tSc2XdANaa	It's very normal to have increased discharge while pregnant. Clear, white, or yellowish discharge increases during pregnancy to help soften the cervix for delivery when the time comes. However, if you ever notice blood or blood-tinged discharge, call your doctor immediately.|`|wZDkn2i2aa	yes its very normal infact you will have that same discharge during the whole pregnancy! The discharge is actually cleaning you out! If you see any greenish or brownish discharge then its something to be alarm about! You can read more about it on pregnancy for dummies trust me that book is great/ internet
R78WYJjBaa	Honestly it's up to YOU when you want to start her on differnt things. It's not up to your doctor or her doctor because they aren't always right. Our little girl was 2 months old and we had to start her on rice cereal because she was always hungry and that helped alot then we gradually moved onto stage 1 foods around 3months,we asked her doctor and he said that they start around 6 months with cereal but if they have problems sleeping sometimes it helps to start early. Try applesauce with her cereal or banannas,fruits are usually easier for them to start with ecspecially since they have sweetness to them then gradually to veggies. I hope this helps,but like I said it's basically your call.|`|YPycXcoLaa	give her pureed fruit and veggies for lunch or tea|`|zGgEVAbraa	ask your doctor if he thinks shes ready for more food. and what he thinks shes ready for|`|AA10686742	Leave her on the rice cereal for now.  Let her get used to that and then gradually add a different type of food one at a time. This will let her belly get used to having different foods.|`|pNC24hxEaa	you can give her stage one fruits and veggies in the afternoon.
7yHBkOczaa	nope im guessing I am about 4 weeks and started to feel some symptoms like sore boobs and a little light headed and kinda off colour|`|YP3rEESUaa	they say that you usually start to feel the symptoms around the time you miss your period or even a few weeks after that, so its not to early for you to be feeling them. Congrats!!!|`|2FH6IuPlaa	I was lucky with this one.  I didn't have any symptoms until I was well into my second trimester.|`|9dq0QUGGaa	No every one is different some may have symptoms right at first and some may not till they are in their 2 nd trimester.|`|AA10452941	it depends on each person. when i first started to get morning sickness i was about 3 months .|`|cj0hQLwbaa	Possibly, I didnt get symptoms until 6 weeks|`|sZogcNF9aa	Some people get them right away.<br>  I started noticing extreme tiredness around 5 weeks.|`|weY5yrNdaa	i am not sure, how preg you think you may be, but if i can remember correctly, i started getting symptoms around 5 weeks.
lCnz9Z91aa	I had what seemed to be a normal period, right on time, at the beginning of this pregnancy.  A week and a half later, I had spotting and cramping for 5 days.  Mostly, it was brown, but there was some red.  <br>  A few weeks later, at 9 weeks, I had MAJOR bleeding with large clots (at least 8 to 10, each golf-ball sized or bigger).  Of course, I went to the ER, and once the bleeding stopped, I saw my beautiful baby moving around like crazy with a very healthy beating heart on the ultrasound.   <br>  <br>  I'm now 12 1/2 weeks pregnant, and I continue to have brown spotting almost daily, and even some pink and red spotting.  Some women do have a lot of bleeding during pregnancy and are perfectly fine.  In my case, it's because I have a subchorionic hemorrhage in my uterus.  <br>  <br>  In my first pregnancy, I had a TINY bit of brown spotting once or twice.  It was nothing like this.  <br>  <br>  Try not to worry too much about it.  Since this happened to me, I have talked to at least 20 other women who have had this happen.  Bleeding in pregnancy is much more common than you'd think.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's actually really common. brown blood is old blood so i wouldnt worry if it wasn't red and heavy. i spotted until i was 3 mo pregnant- just take it easy and get some rest. you're going to be worryin  for about 31 more weeks|`|5M8kRqQ8aa	I had the same, three sucessful pregnancies in a row. Aparently you can have implantation bleeding well into the first trimester as the placenta grows. I'm glad you had a scan, though.|`|QmX0STXMaa	I don't think it is anything to worry about but if you are then consult a doctor for Ur own peace of mind|`|ba055a468a802f924ac09085f0de94d8aa	You have done the right thing in going to get it checked i had brown spotting and miscarried (there was no heart beat) April 07 then had brown spotting in Aug 07 and it was ectopic.Your situation sounds different  a heart beat I'm sure you'll be fine all the best xx|`|jGOPgcw5aa	With my second pregnancy I had spotting between weeks 8 and 10 - with one day of actually bright red blood (dripped into the toilet!) I went on to have a healthy baby boy :)<br>  <br>  Sometimes as they embryo burrows deep into the lining of your uterus there is a tiny tearing and you can spot.|`|WVHzh9qJaa	Spoting occurs when baby is forming in the womb.  The same question was asked by me when I had my first pregnancy sometimes in year 2003. I was seeing blood but the colour was brownish.  I became worried and visited my Doctor who erased my fears. Before then I thought I was going to have miscarriage but, he told me the baby was trying to form in my womb.<br>  <br>  After the 11th months the bleeding stopped, my baby was fine when I went for scan. Now my girl is now more than three years, she will be four this year.<br>  <br>  Madam Wasilat, don't entertain fear. Your baby is alright.|`|YDJeMEziaa	With my last 2 pregnancies - I had brown spotting off and on until about 10 weeks. The first time I freaked out but then it kept happening and I continued going to the dr and everything would be OK. With my current pregnancy, I didnt freak out as much when it happened - if it is brown blood - it is just your body cleaning out old stuff. Worry more if it is bright red - in a large quanity - and accompanied with severe cramps. The cramps you felt could have been the baby implanting. Just try not to worry - stress is the worst thing for you and the baby - chances are everything is fine!!|`|h7yzQP0Uaa	I had bleeding throughout a pregnancy and went on to have a healthy baby at 37 weeks.  A friend of mine had monthly bleeding throughout both her pregnancies and had healthy, full term babies.  Sometimes you never find out the cause of bleeding.  The best thing you can do I think is to try not to worry too much (easier said than done I know) and maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Good luck!|`|uIgthzUgaa	I had some blood in week 8, went for a scan and everything was fine. Mine was an ultra sound and they were able to see were the blood was coming from, it was outside of the womb, bekow the baby, completely unrelated to the pregnancy, just a clot.<br>  <br>  I know it is really easy to say, but do try to relax and not worry.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your pregnancy
xXnFx6qLaa	I had this problem with my son as well... And I can tell you what the problem was but you are going to think I'm nuts.<br>  <br>  I was always SO nervous about giving him a bath.  I don't know why, I was just scared to death.  And every time I did it, he screamed his head off which made me even more nervous.<br>  <br>  So one day I decided I am NOT going to be nervous today, I kept myself calm and sang to him while getting him undressed and sang to him on the way to the bath and stopped in front of the mirror to say "Hi Baby" (that cracks him up) and then kept singing as I slowly put him in the tub and he whimpered a little bit, but no full on screaming... <br>  <br>  So the next bath, I did the same thing and we were both a little bit calmer... And the next bath came and he was actually playing in the water.<br>  <br>  I really do think it was because I was stressed/nervous and he could feel it.<br>  <br>  That's just my situation, but maybe it helps?  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wn5M2MZIaa	talk to a Dr. It might be a medical condition|`|jjYSOwGhaa	Maybe the bathtub is too big and scary for her , try bathing her in the kitchen sink.  Make sure to clean it thouroughly prior and after and to clear the area of anything and everything|`|mB7iuKVpaa	Did you try taking a bath with her?|`|xkHxZ1jBaa	I don't think there is much you can do about.  My daughter hated baths because they involved being naked which she also hated.  She started to like them when she was old enough to actually play with the water.<br>  <br>  You can try showering with her but I don't think you can really make her like them at this point.|`|yBbcTSw5aa	Give her some toys to play with.. lol thats so0o cute...and yea like dat other guy said.. try takin a bath with her..and dont forget toys... and maybe turn on some resting music for her or u can sing..Good luck
AA11972683	Hun, you really need some counselling, not a baby right now.  What you did is done, and all you can do is move forward.  Getting pregnant is not the answer.  You need to deal with your guilt and your emotions first.  It will make you a better parent in the future. <br>  <br>  The shot you had may have been rho-gam.  Is your blood type negative?  When a mom has -ve blood, and has any kind of bleeding during pregnancy, they get the shot.  It keeps your body from developing antibodies against the baby's blood.  If the baby's blood was +ve and mixed with mom's blood antibodies would form, and then in future pregnancies if a baby had +ve blood, the antibodies would attack the baby, causing the pregnancy to end.<br>  <br>  If your miscarriage was performed by an OB/GYN and there were no complications your miscarriage is completely unrelated.  Occassionaly scar tissue can form, and cause problems but this is very unlikely.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Um if you were 16 1 year and four mos ago how old are now 18 at the most right ?... but you've been trying for 5 mos ... grr|`|kShZDNGpaa	You can't replace one baby with another.. Seriously why did you get an abortion in the first place just to wind up pregnant again, did you not learn anything.. What's problably wrong is that your body hasn't had time to heal physically or emotionally.. Just take it easy and don't worry about having anymore children...|`|qKEzhwIBaa	I think the shot is for people that are RH negative. Planned parenthood seems to give this to everyone.|`|uecwFz0Daa	You are 17 and trying to get pregnant?  I think you do need help and it's not about any shot.  <br>  <br>  As mentioned in your other question, it is likely you are RH negative and received a Rhogam shot.  Write the clinic stating your name and date of when you had the abortion and ask them to tell you what injection you received.  Rhogam has no effect on fertility.
LrXxwtj3aa	Check her temp.  If it is higher than 101 (rectal), she needs to be seen.  If not, there are a few things you can do to make her more comfortable.  Use a humidifier in the room she is in.  Buy saline drops for her nose and use the bulb syringe to help her breathe.  You apply the saline drops before you use the bulb syringe, it will help loosen anything that needs to come out.  Do not do this too often, it can make it worse.  Lots and lots of cuddles and make sure you are checking her temp often.  She should be fine, good luck!!|`|AA11885437	saline drops for her nose will help, put in the drops then suck em out with a nasal aspirator. Also a humidifier may help, or just set her in the bathroom with you when you shower so she gets the benefits of the steam. I put mine in a bouncer on the bathroom floor when she had a stuffy nose. There wont be anything the doctor can do for her at this age. If you are nursing you may try to offer extra feedings so she gets more fluids/ and antibodies to help her get over the cold quicker. Best of Luck!|`|oMAXAQA0aa	If you keep her in the carseat, watch the head does not droop. Very bad for them when that goes on.<br>  But it IS good to have her somewhat upright, even a slght incline in her sleep surface willl help her sleep with clearer breathing.<br>  Do not leave her unattended when altering sleeping surfaces. She could get annoyed and roll all crazy if she's uncomfortable.|`|AA11972683	As long as see can breathe OK, and she doesn't have a fever there isn't too much a doctor can do.  If the mucous is green or yellow it is indictive of an infection.  Keep an eye on her.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, if she is stuffy you can put saline drops in her nose (available at the drug store), or sit in the bathroom with her with the shower on straight hot.  The steam will help her breathe better.  Feed her on demand as she may not be taking as much per feed because its hard to eat and breathe.<br>  If her cough becomes brassy, or tight sounding then take her in.  If she appears to be having difficulty things to look for include  nostril flaring, seeing her ribs clearly when she breathes, or any bluish hue in the face or around her lips.  See a doctor immeadiately if any of these things happen.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and take care.  She will feel better in a few days, and then you will too.  Keep up the good work!|`|fdfzYLOyaa	You need to get some saline solution from the pharmacy if she has a head congestion's. Make sure you child is sleeping in a up right position. It is easier if you allow the child to sleep in the car seat. This helps the child with the sinus draining. It is very common for a newborn to catch a cold. But you still need to take her to the doctor to make sure she is ok.|`|lWUknox6aa	she should be seen by her pediatrician.  Usually sick babies under 2 months old should be seen just to be on the safe side.|`|v1thde5Paa	Call them see if there is anything they can recommend giving her. Better than dragging her out when she's not feeling well.|`|3U1gELh0aa	They can't do anything for a cold. All you can do for a stuffy nose is to suck it out with a aspirator after irrigating with some saline spray. You can run a vaporizer near her bed, but aimed away from her. i would still call the doctor, to get some advise over the phone.|`|4m96vlnIaa	more than likely if you take her to the doctor they will tell you that she is too little for meds, get you a vaporizer and use that for the cough you can run Vic's on her little feet then put her socks on her... that will calm her cough, for her nose just just saline and suck her nose with a nose sucker.... she wont like it but she will be able to breath, but use your judgment and i would never discourage a doctor visit|`|QSIpMmh6aa	Take her just to be safe. Take care of the cute little bugger. =)|`|QvVUCkc9aa	You can take her to the doctor if you want to have her seen, but I know from experience with my little guy that there's not much they can do for a baby with a cold...and as for cold medications, they say you're not supposed to give them any until they're at least 2 years old (for the over the counter kinds, even though they say a younger age)...even now, when my 18 month gets a cold, my doctors and nurses tell me not to give him anything, just Tylenol if he's got a fever.  It's tough because it's hard seeing them sick and not being able to do much about it...good luck to you, and I hope your daughter feels better soon.  :)|`|WHFWzT4caa	To ease your mind take her. But it could be allergies.|`|h5bzGzhsaa	all you can do it suck her nose out with a bulb syringe, use a humidifier and saline spray|`|koHePHKdaa	I havent had any babies, but it would seem to me to keep her as warm as possible.  I would atlleast call the doctor and see what he reccommends. It will give you peace of mind as I know you are very concerned.Good luck, I hope she gets well very soon, God Bless.|`|YKnSDehcaa	Yeah I have a 6 month old and when he was 1 month he started getting stuffy noses and coughing and sneezing. I felt soooooo bad. I called all kinds of doctors. I was not satisfied with the first answers I got but they all told me the same thing and if I wasn't satisfied that I could take him in. They pretty much told me the same things that everyone else in here is telling you. Keep the room she is in moisturized with a humidifier or vaporizer. If there is no moisture in the air it causes her nose to become stuffy. If her nose stays stuffy use saline drops in her nose and let it sit for a minute or so to loosen the mucous up then suction it out. Keep suctioning if she sounds stuffy. Unfortunately there is nothing you can give a 1 month old. She is still too small. I was also told that the infant vicks would still be a little too strong for a 1month old.|`|c6CHNyCSaa	Anything for a newborn is something you don't take lightly and a pediatrician needs to look into it. I am a mother of 2 boys -  2 1/2 yrs old and a 6month old preemie (actual age, adjusted age - 4months). It is better and safe to have a physician check your child than sit at home and wonder. This way, even if the doctor says there's no need to worry - you know you have done something proactive. In that regards, i just took my 6month old to his dr. today since i gave him my cough. Turns out he also has a slight ear infection, and so, now he is on antibiotic, and we're doing nebulizer treatment to keep him from getting congested and so he won't start wheezing.<br>  And always trust your gut feeling/instinct. THere's nothing wrong with that. THat's what your pediatrician is there for. And they won't fault you for it. GOod luck!|`|ccn6lWGKaa	I wouldn't take her to the doctor. There isn't much they can do at this age, and her immune system is very vulnerable right now. You dont' want to expose her to more germs. Try a humidifier to keep everything loose. Saline drops are good as well. A warm wet cloth and then vaseline under the nose to prevent dryness and chafing.|`|pecaYlcpaa	Hiya.  Generally the biggest thing you need to worry about it making sure your baby can breathe okay - babies will always breathe through their noses so that's the thing you might want to concentrate on.<br>  <br>  You can use saline drops to help clear her nose a little - there is a spray called "Fess" which is perfectly safe for newborns, that will help clear her nose a bit and make her more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Make sure she gets plenty of liquids - and if she's still the same after more than two or three days, get her to the doctors before it turns into anything nasty :)|`|sJd1FYzXaa	You can also run a hot shower and just sit in the steamy bathroom with the baby to help the chest congestion and stuffy nose. Just be sure to wrap the baby up before leaving the comforts of the steamy warmth so the baby doesn't get sicker.|`|sRvSpSBYaa	I would Call before trying to take her out honestly, we ALWAYS call and talk to our dr, or drs nurse before bringing our son in unless we just know he needs to go in for something. I say call first because getting her out will most likely make her worse, if your dr says bring her in then obviously take her in..<br>  I wouldn't have her out anymore than you have to.<br>  My Son got a bad cold stuffy nose, bad congestion, coughing..etc..The dr put him on Breathing treatments for this.<br>  She may have the same thing my son had, Bronchilitis...Its going around in our area BAD! We were told NOT to take him out...he was wheezing down in his lungs it was so sad. =(<br>   He was 5months old though.<br>  My Son had these symptoms and he was sick through the weekend and couldnt get to the dr, next time i know to immediately nip the cold in the butt!! <br>  I just didnt realize how quickly a baby can go from a little cold to, being fully blown out sick!!<br>  So, its always better safe than sorry, Ecspecialy with a 1month old..<br>  Good Luck Sweetie!!
NsrTYN9haa	YES it can be in his system!!  It depends on how far along you are.  If you are 33 weeks or more it can.  If you are under that and stay away from people that are doing it your baby should be okay...You however have already killed a few brain cells....|`|93b7ec7fdebf357a510ed9e542f2ce4caa	how far along are you? but you have to ask yourself was it worth your baby? was being around people smoking worth your babys possible health and possibly giving your baby up.most of my friends smoke and thats not something i can make them stop doing, but when they are about tosmoke they let me know and i leave the room and go watch tv somewhere else. i quit smoking bc i dont want to hurt my baby and i have to act more like an adult now so i really dont want to be around it either. <br>  <br>  sorry i know that was a little opinionated but to answer your question, it really depends how far along you are and how "in contact" you were with the smoke. i didnt smoke for a few months but was around it alot when i was younger and my dad didnt beleive that i didnt smoke so made me get a drug test and it came up clean, even though i had been around it everyday. so i really dont know wat the test will say all i can say is your about to be a mother and you have to start making better decisions.|`|uRkyUuXSaa	first off why did you ever put yourself in a situation with marijuana and it all depends where you there on a regular basis?|`|1EIamqMzaa	yes it is possible. What a stupid idea! Grow up!|`|LjQfCmGbaa	Its possible. Depends on how poorly ventilated the room was and how much you actually got into your system. Start using your head, you can get your baby taken away from you if you don't start thinking about the consequences of your actions. EVen though you say you didn't smoke, you did choose to be around those that were which is very irresponsible as a mom-to-be.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	i dont think so cuz when a person smokes themselves it is usually out of the system between 2 and 4 weeks. i personally smoked for 3 months of my pregnancy(ofcourse i didnt know i was pregnant) and my sis in law smoked the whole time(she knew she was pregnant) and both of our kids are perfectly fine. so for that you have nothing to worry about. i would stay away from that from now on tho.|`|FVXHcTCAaa	I think maybe but should be slim! Keep away from trouble or you will lose your baby!!!! You now need new friends or chance losing your child and smearing your reputaion, especially if your not involved!!

Not 2 get on your cause but that was not a good ideal. when your pregnant. u come second your child come first born or not. You know your child can have it in there system. if they do a test and find they will take your child away.  your child  also come also have some slight defects. is it worth it? i know someone  have been trying for 2 year to get there child because were born with drug in there system. it's better way to have fun while pregnant then 2 be around people who smoke weed. I pray that every thing work out for the better good. Sometimes we learn form our mistake and sometime we don't. i pray u did.|`|qSWoZatoaa	my sister went through the same thing. if you are around it breathing it in then it will get into the babies system. it will get out though so no need to worry. if you are not that far along then it wont show up in the babies system because it takes 30 days to get out of your system and takes 3-5 days to get out if you dont smoke it and never had and dependin on how much you smoked. beins that you wont smoking it it should only take a couple days to get out your system and your babies. it is a possiblity it is still in your babies system but its very small. my sister was almost due when it happened to her and when she had my neice they tested her and she came out positive but there was nothing they could do cuz it was not in her system just the babies. chances are very low for it to be in the babies system so dont worry. good luck with your baby and i hope all goes well.|`|wteI1Oakaa	how far along are you? how much smoke was involved? it is possible that it could show up....but it also could not, it depends on lots of things really.

I would watch for the mucus plug to fall out. It would look like a thick discharge, but only for a day or so. I would also watch out for any extra wetness down there, your water could be leaking a bit. Any back aches that don't seem to go away and get worse could be the early onset of labor, this usually hapens within 24-36 hours of delivery. If you need any more advice, feel free to email me, i've had three babies.....GOOD LUCK!

A good way to tell if something is wrong is with if you can keep down water and bread becuase the baby cannot go without food. That was the cause of the stomach cramps where it was being squashed and the sick was pushing what she had eating out of her. But seen as your only 9 weeks im not sure this actually counts for that because the baby isnt formed or big enough to squash your stomache, So im not sure it might be kind of the same becuase of the place its laying maybe, im not sure. Whatever anyone tells you, Its best to just get a doctors appointment becuase they know exactly what it is.<br>  <br>  Just get a doctors appointment tell him whats going on. If you cant keep water and break down, Go to the emergancy room. Try not to worry will make you worse, just remember you may not have what my sister had. After them giving her a C section, she was presented with a beautiful healthy Little girl On the 28th of may.. Hilary rose connea.

Drink lots and lots of water (little sips to start with!), and if you still can't keep this down, go to your doctor and they may prescribe an anti sickness pill that's completely safe to take during pregnancy that stops you from feeling sick. Your baby is fine, it's a parasite and takes whatever it needs from you, so it's draining you of all your body fat and body fluids, which is why drinking is so important! If you can't keep liquids down, then there's risk of kidney failure and infections. <br>  <br>  Stay away from anything that makes you feel sick. A smell, a food, a drink, anything! Morning sickness is normal, and if you think that hurts, wait another 8 months and then think about the sweet, sweet time when all you had to worry about was throwing up, because labour is a lot harder!!|`|AA10728216	i lost a  lot of weight due to morning sickness but im better now. it is perfectly normal to loose weight because your stomach cant keep the food down. you will feel very tired and you will want to sleep a lot because as you know, food gives us energy.<br>  <br>  morning sickness is caused by an irritation of the stomach due to hormones. what really hellped me was drinking a  glass of water before eating anything, that way you trhow up the water instead and the nausea goes away and then you can have little pieces of fruit or dry cookies or bread. <br>  <br>  you will start regaining your appetite soon <br>  <br>  remeber to take vitamins to try to balance the lack of nutrients you get from food. <br>  <br>  i suggest you take the vitamins right before you go to bed at night. <br>  <br>  congrats on your baby , and dont let anyone tell you its wrong . a baby is a  blessing, and blessings always come at the right time :)|`|hdrIaMF3aa	morning sickness is normal but if u cant keep anything down at all call your doctor asap|`|6189125e1ad87195375957adba600e39aa	ya its normal just morning sickness|`|Gg4ZTZ3saa	um, it is normal to get sick, some ppl get really sick during the first trimester. and my cousin when she was pregnant lost some weight, but it is not healthy to continue losing weight. you can lose some at first but by now i would assume you should be gaining it back. now, you shouldn't be getting huge just yet. but they say that if you are smaller or regular size you should gain from 25-30 lbs by the end of your pregnancy. i would say definitly get in touch with your dr. and see what's going on. if you are just getting sick like most ppl do, i suggest as my dr. has suggested me (an so has everyone else) drink some sprite or 7UP or coke (sprite is usually best i think) and eat some crackers. take small sips, and chew slowly. when you brush your toungue or teeth if you find that you vomit, then be careful not to brush as far back. if you get sick often in the mornings have some drink an crackers set up for in the morning so you don't have to get up. if/when you get sick later (if you know about what time it happens) try and make oatmeal the last thing you ate (it sounds strange but that's the best stuff i have ever thrown up because it doesn't burn, it's just gross). i hope i helped! good luck!<br>  ps. if you wanna personally talk you can email me at plowboyup3@yahoo.com, i'm 19 and 6 weeks pregnant and totally get where you're coming from.|`|5Gv2n2b9aa	hi:)everything is normal ,but i think losing weight isn't normal at all . should go to a doctor.|`|bTJH5y6Zaa	That is morning sickness, but if it gets worse or you start to feel unsure make sure you talk to someone about it.|`|T2UYb2gTaa	Yes I'm 5 weeks pregnant and I have stomach pains as well.|`|UpDWtvEeaa	HOW OLD WAS YOUR ''LOVER?"'

pGztKgykaa	I can't see how you would be able to get out of your parents' house. Why would you? You will need their support. If Dad is not around, grandpa and grandma are even more important.<br>  <br>  Some savings tips:<br>  1) Breastfeed. No cost. Enough said.<br>  2) Cloth diaper if you have a washer and dryer. You'll save hundreds of dollars a year.<br>  3) Cut back on everything that is optional. Movies, new clothes for you (other than things that wear out), cable, cell phone, internet access, everything. <br>  4) You do not need tons of stuff for a baby. Somewhere for the baby to sleep, some basic clothes, diapers, a car seat (if you will be driving)and that's it. A stroller is not necessary. I never used one (by choice) and did just fine. If you have a large purse, you don't need a diaper bag.<br>  <br>  Not to be snarky, but why not get married? I'm assuming (and I could be wrong) that the dad is not a horrible guy. If you were married, you would have better family benefits from the military, as well as a stable home life for your baby. Just something to consider...<br>  <br>  Also, you have 6 months to find a better paying job. You could take classes at night and work toward something better-paying. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could nanny for another family once your baby is here. Some families will give you room and board plus wages to nanny. It's not a perfect scenario, but you would be with your child all day and have no child care costs (in my area, full-time child care is at least $1,000 a month). Plenty of moms are able to care for an infant and another child at the same time. You could do that too.|`|AA12370001	you need to find a job that first of all isn't hourly and pays you a proper wage.  With no days off and working a full 8 hours each day, you are only looking at $22,880 without taking out any taxes.  You can't live in NY on that amount!  You could go and be a receptionist, data entry clerk, maintenance worker, etc. and make at least double that walking in the door!!!!|`|x7vTKP24aa	there should be somekind of support system there that can help you. i dont usually promote welfare, but if you really cant make ends meet than you cant.<br>   maybe you could move out of the city where things are not as expensive. get a social worker have them help you. im sure you will get more child support than you are expecting.|`|EKL9JCL9aa	If you want to make it you will. I supported two kids with no child support on 13/hour while paying 1400/month rent in california. <br>  Keep track of where your money goes. Dont splurge on stupid things.<br>  <br>  Go to the library and get some books on frugal living and budgeting. That should help. Start saving NOW, you still have a few months to get some savings before you have the baby.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I don't think you could move out and support a baby on $11 per hour, especially in NY.  You're probably better off staying with your family.  Besides, living alone with a newborn will not be easy. When you have an infant it really helps to have people around you.

Maybe you should have thought about this 3 months ago.|`|WOugJxMvaa	Sounds like you should have thought of all this BEFORE you got knocked up.|`|f1vlhGawaa	I would suggest either staying at home or temporarily getting welfare. Go to a trade school to become a medical assistant, dental assistant, or something like that, alot of the classes can even be taken online. They usually take about 9 months to complete and those jobs pay very well and are always in demand. See how much you could get done before the baby is born, then you could complete the courses after you are back on your feet. Don't let yourself get depressed, be proactive, you are bringing a beautiful life into the world and it is your job to give it a beautiful life. Congrats and good luck.<br>  
IFDfpbFJaa	It wouldn't be kidnapping if it's a parent. It's Child Abduction when it's a parent.

Here's a good way to get protective custody of the baby--breastfeeding. Tell your doctor that your baby's father abuses you, and she will point you to the proper place for legal action to protect the baby. <br>  <br>  Mothers have special rights, especially with newborns. If you claim that you are breastfeeding the baby, he can't even get partial custody. How often he sees the baby will be totally up to you. |`|DYJOpfvraa	First of all, as long as he doesn't live in New York he does not have jurisdiction. On the other hand, you do. Right when you give birth and able to move around go to the courthouse and file 'physical and legal' custody of your child.<br>  While you are there see if you can get a temporary restraining order (TRO). If possible try and get it before the baby is born. If he's been abusive to you he could become even more abusive right before the baby is born despite the fact that he's in Virginia.<br>  Take precautionary measures and take care of your self and baby.|`|jLYTKr33aa	If all of this is true, I sincerely hope you've made a police report against him.  If he goes to court to get visitation, that's one thing.  There's also no guarantee that custody will go your way; he could get unsupervised visitation.  But if he's threatening to kidnap the baby, see if you can get a protective order against him.  Also, don't let him know where you're going to give birth.  |`|6JycWsYnaa	As prior military, I would suggest you contact his commanding officer and let him know what is going on.

My husband and I are finishing up a 6 month court battle over his daughter.  I'm not sure of every states law, but I found out some states automatically grant custody to the mother if there's no other custody order in writing through the court. Go online and research the laws in your state.|`|B9mpxKi5aa	ummm, tell teh court eveything that is in this question DO NOT LEAVE ONE THING OUT and then sue him,,, ull win,,, the wife abuse costs lol|`|l9xTs8Fjaa	sew him and go to court. there you will have custody of your child by law.|`|9s1It2WKaa	This may be serious go to court!|`|AA11100890	I would not let his have a part in the child's life right now.  He sounds crazy and doesn't have the kid's best interest in mind.  You're not married, right?  You can choose to not list him on the birth certificate.  You seem to have enough evidence to file a protection from abuse order against him.   At least on behalf of your child.  If you choose to you can always drop the PFA later.  You need primary/sole custody.  He needs no custody.  You really don't want him visiting without you there.  |`|Hdoxi8EZaa	What is your concern?  Unless there is something you are leaving out, he has very little chance to get unsupervised visitation, much less custody.  <br>  <br>  If you are really worried, you can contact my law firm.  I'm licensed in CT and NY.  I don't want to give the number so I don't get calls for free advice, but you can email me at jeff.jeffcoat@snet and I can tell you how to reach me if you need advice.<br>  <br>  Jeff|`|RlskYr26aa	To the person with the "story".  It seems to me that you are bored and have nothing to do but make up stories online.  To the people answering the question:  It is obvious this story is made-up and false because if this person is able to get online, log into groups, formulate and pose a question, then the person obviously is somewhat computer savy and can research custody issues online, etc.  <br>  <br>  Come on people.  Open your eyes.  This person is laughing at you.  This person needs to get a life.  
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	you picked him...|`|pXSKSS3daa	Have him carry around an 8 lb. bowling ball for a day and ask him how it makes him feel. Ugh.<br>  <br>  If you're riding in the car with him and his friends speak up and tell them to put their darn cigarettes out! When pregnant you shouldn't be lifting anything over 20-25 lbs., especially if you weren't doing it BEFORE you became pregnant. Sit down and tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  Honestly, he just sounds like he doesn't care about you, what you're going through, and the health of this baby. If that's the case you ARE better off without him.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	He's not your boss so don't do the things he asks such as lifting heavy boxes and such.<br>  <br>  Your child or him?  Should be an easy choice....and I know in your heart you know the answer already.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you..and stay healthy|`|gFiRi5xnaa	It sounds like he doesn't want the baby to be there anyway. It would be one thing if he just didn't get it, but he's physically endangering the baby with the smoke, and cologne and physical labor he wants you to do. Get out of there, because the first 10 weeks are the foundation of the baby and if anything goes wrong now, thats going to affect the baby for the rest of its life.|`|xQ1z1Zj3aa	My girlfriend is 8 months pregnant and it upsets me when she lifts anything..Have your doctor talk to him, let me quess he dosnt go with you....Im sorry good luck with what ever you discide|`|vek2OwQfaa	I would get rid of him. Really...what is he doing that is good. He doesn't sound like a good person or a good father.|`|WJf05jDFaa	Tell him that you care about the health of the baby; those woman at 9 months that would do something that would harm their unborn baby aren't very good mothers,<br>  and you want to protect your baby as well as you can, and if he continues to endanger the health of your baby; call it off until the baby is born; then try it again.<br>  If he is still a jerk, then find someone better who will care about the welfare of your little one.<br>  Congratulations and good luck (:|`|i7oKJRf1aa	I don't think it's fair that he's treating you this way.... It's just plain wrong. I can't tell you what to do, but ask yourself do you really deserve to be treated like this? And I don't care what anyone says there is no excuse for it. If the women you love is having your baby then you should take care of her(you). HANDS DOWN. If anything my boyfriend treated me best when I was pregnant. Hope this helps and remember you don't have to be treated this way.|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	He sounds like a real winner. As far as the cologne don't worry about that so much. But everything else he just has no idea what you are going through. My husband didn't really get it until he went to a doctors appointment with me and could ask the doctor all kinds of questions for himself. That changed a lot of things for me and for us. and once they hear their baby's heart beat it changes their whole attitude.|`|YE28jqL0aa	what a fricken loser.<br>  leave him. and dont let him see the baby.<br>  obviously he is a loser and jerk. he doesnt care.<br>  LEAVE.<br>  what kind of guy doesnt know that a preggo woman cant be inhaling fumes and carrying heavy things and other fricken obvious things like that... ahhh... this makes me so angry. i want to punch him. :)|`|L2rxDUbuaa	Well he doesn't sound like a fantastic catch does he? Try a trial separation to see if that shocks him into getting his act together. However it's not up to you if he sees the child or not - the child will have the right to see his or her father.|`|aKiynqA6aa	sounds liek you already know what to do.  one thing you should maybe try is taking him to the doctors office with you and having them explain everything to him.|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	Im 3 mos pregnant with my second baby and my husband wouldnt dare talk to me like that or tell me to do ANYTHING that i didnt want to do. He knows im the princess for the entire 9 mos!!!!<br>  <br>  First of all he cares about me and our unborn baby... sounds like ur guy doesnt. If i were u id leave his sorry butt. U shouldnt settle for being treated like dirt because u love him or because hes the father of ur child. Not worth it. There are plenty of men who will help u even though they're not ur babys daddy. My husband isnt my first child's father but loves him more than anything...<br>  <br>  Find a new man, or hell stay single until ur baby is born. Do whats right for u and dont worry about him. U should tell him exactly what u think and if he doesnt listen then u should leave him. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|uEo0vS7aaa	Who says you have to stay with him? If he is disrespecting you and the baby isn't even here, How do you think he will treat the baby. Yes, once the baby gets here some guys wise up and mature, but what if he doesn't. All of the things that you are telling us shows that he has no concern for how you feel and if you are hurt or hurting the baby. In life we must make choices: Do you want a healthy baby or that man. I would chose my child. You can always get another more loving and respectful boyfriend.|`|TnCcOaFQaa	it doesn't sound like he cares about you or the baby.  if you want to give him a second chance, i say drag his butt to the dr. with you and let the dr. tell him what you can or can't do/should or shouldn't do.  if he's still acting like a jackass, then send him packing.  just a side note:  i know things can be difficult when you're pregnant, but sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and your unborn baby.  if you're scared of him, leave him now!|`|8eL7S5Hfaa	Take him to a doctor's appointment with you and ask the doctor if all your symptoms are normal and if you can do the things he is asking you too. Maybe that will make him realize what you are going through. I had my boyfriend read a book made for guys about pregnancy. It is more funny than serious but it helped him understand what I am going through. You could try that. I hope he stops being a jerk. Good Luck!|`|f8Bc7Lrnaa	It's not just hurting you it's hurting your baby and if you think that this is going to get better after the baby is born you are wrong. It will only get worse. You need to think about what's better on you and the baby. Screw him if he don't care. Good Luck.|`|ft2EmHFoaa	Wow, I don't like him, ha. Take him to the doctor with you next time you go and get your doctor to help explain it to him. Also, you should look up on the internet exactly what secondhand smoke does to a baby while its in the womb, because its really sad. Good luck.|`|xEC3E06Baa	you poor thing!you need to think about your baby,he seems like doesnt care about you or  the baby!do you have support from ur parents??i think you need to be around them at a time ike this!if you need to talk email me x|`|8e96a7aeb87ff7ad56089a315394ced6aa	I advise you to sit and have a deep conversation with him about how you feel. if he still acts as though he doesnt care. LEave him until the baby is born. |`|4pHDIcafaa	Im really sorry that you are going through that. Youre pregnant and it should be an enjoyable time in your life and you should be pamered and treated like a Godess. I understand exactly how you feel because my husband is the same exact way...he expects me to do everything that I was able to do before with no change but I cant. Im 9 months pregnant. He just doesnt get it. But anyways my advice to you is this: Is it really just how he is dealing with the pregnancy or is this his character. Some men are more emotional and sensitive than others while other men are just so non chalant about everything and they lack a sensitivity chip. I would definatley write a list of the good and bad about him and see which one outweighs the other. Sometimes you gotta accept the bad with the good. Ive learnt to do that with my husband. Hes got other qualities that make up for his lack of sensitivity. Also Im waiting to see how he will be when we have the baby..he might just change. Maybe your boyfriend will see your little bundle of joy and it will soften him up a bit. GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS!!!!!!|`|7fq4meqLaa	Only you know what is best for you. Im not living in your situation so I do know all the facts. But I think that you need to do what is best for you and your baby. It seems that he is not treasuring your child like its his and he loves and cares about it! It doesnt seem like he cares about or respects you who are the mother of his child. I think that you need to sit done and have a serious talk with him express your feelings to him and if he doesnt get his act together get your **** and leave his sorry *** you can do bad by yourself. You're are not only living for you now your living for your unborn child too. I can tell you already love your baby or it would be no need to put yourself thruogh all the pain and dicomfort your goin through. So my advice is that if he cant get with the program and he's not even worrying about yalls health now how is he goona be later. Doesn't seem like he's on the same page as you. Anyway good luck and I hope you feel better.
yJiP6nrYaa	If you're not late for your period then you should wait a week. If it is implantation bleeding then it would be to early for a test because the egg is just getting planted.

7pafh1Nkaa	You have to ovulate to get pregnant meaning an egg needs to be released.  However it is difficult even with BBT charting to be sure of when you ovulated.  It gives you a rough idea of when you did ovulate and you can usually find the pattern of when you generally ovulate.   Some women ovulate multiple times in a cycle, and if you just count the days between your cycle start you won't know for sure when or if you ovulated.  So it is safest to assume anytime you have sex you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  As far as the earliest when you can get an accurate blood test it would be about 10 days after implantation of the fertilized egg.  It takes at least ten days for HcG (pregnancy hormone) level to rise enough that it is detectable in the blood.  Implantation can happen anytime after egg fertilization but there is no set number of days after intercourse that can give you an idea of when to test since even if you know when you ovulated you cannot know when the egg was fertilized and then implanted.  Even with IVF where you know when fertilized eggs are placed in the uterus you cannot know when implantation has taken place without the usual 2 week wait.  Most places will not blood test until you have at least one positive urine pregnancy test or have missed a certain number of menstrual cycles.  <br>  <br>  Of course in cases of an ectopic pregnancy it is not uncommon for it to take much longer after implantation to have HcG levels rise high enough to be detectable in the blood.|`|Z4NmoQkFaa	you can get pregnant anytime you have unprotected sex..its just more likely when your ovulating! i think its like a week after the sex you can have a positive result form a blood test|`|xfV0PKlQaa	yes! <br>  You there is always the chance of pregnancy when you have unprotected sex. Doesn't anyone read these messages?<br>  |`|raTECpL5aa	YES|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes..  sperm can live inside of you for 3-5 days.. <br>  <br>  most women dont really know when they are ovulating anyways, there's such a wide time frame, anywhere from 10-18 days before the period is "average"..  meaning it could be more, or less.  I've heard of women who ovulate towards the end of their period.. meaning they are fertile the entire month!|`|ErCJnABBaa	You can only get pregnant when you ovulate (because the egg only lives for about 12 hours unless it's fertilized).  But sperm can survive for 5 days (maybe upto a week under just the right circumstances).  But how to you know when you are going to ovulate (unless you are tracking your fertility with BBT, CM and CP records).  You can't even rely on your period to know you're not about to ovulate, because it's possible to have a period if you don't ovulate (anovulatory bleeding) and if that happens, you can ovulate at any time.  (And you won't know if you've had anovulatory bleeding or a true menstral period unless you've been charting ovulation with BBT).<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more, read the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertilty".
xypA3yZMaa	Keep it in your pants! at least until you learn how to spell. |`|VyU2d8Ohaa	i can't see any reason for you going to jail|`|HwI6iwDOaa	you could charged with rape. Sorry.|`|5fmPj6uEaa	If you were  over 14 and she was under 14  I think it would be yes, but here it wouldn't be if both parties were over 16 (14 for the male), but not sure about usa as states seem to have different statutes for all sorts of things and no solid central foundation of laws.|`|y96eYj0Faa	Depending on your country or state. But mainly you cant get booked if you were under the age of 18 at the time of intercourse. Nope, you can't go to jail. I suggest doing some more research on the matter but I'm pretty positive that you can't go to jail.|`|kO0XkRleaa	Pregnut? You might not go to jail, but you certainly shouldn't teach your possible future kid to spell.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You don't say where you live. Look up legal age of consent. The laws are listed there by state and country. |`|IW1BMJNuaa	I am not sure what state you live in But in my state a 17 yr old can't get charged with anything. The girl had sex with you because she wanted to and that is not against any law. The social worker only was threatening her because of her parents being so against your relationship. As far as her being pregnant, the judge is going to see you as two minors who had unprotected sex and thats it. When parents get angry they take drastic action especially if they can't stand you.|`|xfV0PKlQaa	It varies from state to state but yes you could go to jail of a detention facility. In most states you can be tried as an adult at 17. And it is not so much your age but the age of the girl. She is a minor. In most countries, sex with a minor is big trouble.|`|HKKmQCsBaa	I think that the social worker is trying to scare her if you are both minors then there is nothing that they can do about it no she dose not have the right to threaten her at all |`|JXVhVODcaa	You're not 18 yet so no. You can't be sent to jail.|`|N40HrW8haa	I doubt it. The age of consent is 16 in most states.
t5tU3Xe8aa	Same thing happeend to me about 4-5 years ago I'm so sorry for your loss :  ( i know what it's like to loose a baby I had 3 misscarriges before having my twin daughters!!|`|vJfcepDOaa	I'm sorry - that sounds like a terrible thing to happen, but please don't be scared. The doctor may examine and test the material you passed (if you kept it) and may examine you internally to make sure your reproductive system is okay.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor or family/friends if you need support while your boyfriend is so far away.<br>  <br>  You will be fine :)|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	this sounds like a miscarraige to me too (although i have never had one)<br>  <br>  as hard as this is , you need to get to the doctor and explain what happened.  its really important that all the products of conception have passed out of your body.<br>  <br>  also the doctor can do some blood tests and determine if you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  i am so sorry for your loss and your situation *hugs*|`|8VJwoGXKaa	Um yeah.  It sounds like you did miscarry.  Are you going to see a doctor?  You really need to so that you can find out for sure if you did and make sure that everything passes like it's supposed to.  I'm sorry.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Sounds like a miscarriage to me. Get ahold of a doctor, you need to be taken car of so that nothing gets infected. Stay strong (even though that's hard).|`|bcd173d35993f0ffa9da4f1c985072e1aa	I know this must be so difficult for you, especially with your boyfriend so far away.  It sounds like from what other people are saying that it may have been a miscarriage.  But even if your period is starting, you still should get to a doctor soon, that way they can make sure that everything comes out all right and they can comfort you and answer your questions, too.  My mom had 4 miscarriages (don't worry-- this was very unusual I think) in between my brother and I (we are 9 years apart), and my dad said that it was really hard on her physically and emotionally (of course).  but I know that my mom really believed that it was a very natural thing and how amazing that your body knows when is the right time or safe time for you or the baby.  anyway, I just think that in our society/culture there isn't ask much support and allowance for grieving that there is in other cultures (Japanese, for instance.)  Anyway, please get to a doctor that you trust so you can get some physical and emotional support.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  Take care of yourself.|`|kHTCODHAaa	babe you need to get off the computer NOW and get into the emergency room!!!! If you by chance didnt miscarry then something very serious but fixable or treatable could be wrong with baby!! If you wait to long you run the risk of the doctors not even being able to do anything. At the emergency room they can do an exam and tell you if youve miscarryed!! They can also do tests to see what is wrong if you didnt!!! Go there please girly! If you didnt miscarry you can still save your baby....my sister in  law ignored things of that nature and gave birth at 20 weeks, her son lived for 13 mins.....get help! All the worrying is not gunna help if your on the verge of miscarrying so you need to know what is up!|`|57AfoCEDaa	I had the exact same thing happen to me a few years ago.

C88eIxSRaa	There is the chance that you are pregnant. I must agree with the other person, testing with first mornings urine is key in trying to determine if you are pregnant. Also make sure you look at other factors as well. There are many things that can make your cycle irregular. If you test one morning and it still comes out negative, check on of the following things: your blood pressure, your stress level, your weight. These things can affect your cycle and make you believe you are pregnant even if you are not. Of course checking with your doctor is always the best route to take. Good luck and I hope all works out for you.|`|l5HhlcYCaa	My friends sister went through this she had some weired bacteria build up er something <br>  <br>  i hope i helped|`|lfA5Lk2Oaa	I'm having the SAME symptoms, almost the same period start date (Aug 26th), and neg tests. Someone please answer!|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	You should take a test with first morning urine instead because it is more concentrated.  Then see what it says.|`|JxS3QhdIaa	well just to let u know my sister had the same thing happen to her ...she missed her period so i went and got her a test and of course it came out negative...then a couple of days later when her period still didnt arrive she took another one and that one came out negative...she ended up taking like 3 or 4 tests and when she finally went to the doctor when she was almost a month late and she was pregnant so  yes it can happened .........you should go and make sure for your piece of mind if for any other reason<br>  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! good luck
JxS3QhdIaa	yeah you very well could be...they say that when you are prego you have period symptoms like cramping tender you know whats and moodiness!!!!! good luck |`|O9zhAb5faa	Could be pregnancy. I once had period-pain like cramps went to the doctor to see what was up and I was surprisingly pregnant. <br>  <br>  Take the HPT test, it should show up by now. Most of them can show up a few days before your period is due. If you are pregnant you will more than likely have enough hcg in your system to test a positive. <br>  <br>  Why put yourself through the curiosity?
JxS3QhdIaa	you can take a pregnancy test i believe as early as 5 days before your missed periods so if you are in that range then i would just to be safe|`|vhUFH61zaa	try it u may be pregent babe...<br>  
2BdxLgO4aa	Maybe he just doesn't like it. Try some other foods.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	And why does your baby NEED to eat rice? My baby refuses to eat broccoli. Oh well. She can skip it if the texture bugs her.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Rice cereal or just plain rice? If its rice cereal, you can try switching to oatmeal cereal instead...but at 16 months you can give your baby almost everything of what you eat.|`|avx7bLnKaa	rice is pretty bland especially if he's been eating regular table food<br>  <br>  try it with some beans<br>  <br>  my 19 month old son LOVES beans...black, red, almost any<br>  <br>  often times he may eat the beans but not the rice but if i put plenty of the "soup" left from the beans over the rice and beans he gobbles it down.. if i spoon feed him... if he gets to pick at it with his fingers he just eats the beans|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	My son loves rice. Maybe he is not a rice baby like mine. Did you try pasta or potato instead? Lipton makes rice with flavors. I like southwest style. It has veggies and I add my own too with little pieces of chicken. Try something like that.|`|p2dYpPW0aa	he probably doesn't like the texture. The taste is ok. I would blend it with milk or soy milk and make it more of a soft mush until he got used to it.Then gradually make it more texturized.|`|5s0GQsTQaa	try oatmeal.. he does not really have to eat it. just give him baby food... even table food is fine. soft enough for him to chew it. |`|KNpUc7wKaa	I am not sure why it is absolutely critical for your baby to eat rice but try introducing it differently. In my culture we cook rice with milk and some vanilla. It becomes a thick porridge that we top with sugar and cinnamon. It is jummy! You could also try some sweet and sour sauces, or make rice look more exciting by putting it in stir fries.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Try making rice congee instead.  Basically use a little rice and lots of water.<br>  <br>  Use organic rice -- really, it tastes just about 100 times better, and your baby can taste just about 100 times better than you.<br>  <br>  Use brown rice -- white has no flavour.<br>  You can use sweet brown rice, they like the texture better<br>  Wash the rice.<br>  Just put a little rice and lots of water<br>  cook it.<br>  mash it up in a suribachi or mortar with pestle.<br>  <br>  I fed (still do) my kids mainly organic food, and they could immediately tell the difference.  I'd try to give them the same thing but was non-organic, and they'd make a face, Yuck! and spit it out.<br>  <br>  I also didn't give them any sugar or salt etc. and they really learnt the naturally flavours of things first before I introduced any added flavours etc.|`|XOT9rHPMaa	My son could not eat rice.  I gave him oatmeal.  He still does not like rice but that is just him.  He is 18 now.  It is just personal preference.  His little personality is emerging.  Welcome to parenthood.  |`|Ib7WDqiLaa	I don't blame him. I could tell you something about rice that would make you sick all night. If he doesn't like it, feed him something else.|`|ZMFeQG7yaa	the texture? either way at 16 months old he should be able to eat more then rice. Find him something else he likes to eat.|`|LvywvZSeaa	Uhhh...don't make him eat it.|`|wePlbqf4aa	he don't like it that's why hes not eating it!|`|2ubRBhdJaa	If it is plain white rice try a little bit of brown sugar.

I hate okra!  yuck.|`|wRnnxg5saa	rice doesn't have a strong smell so he probably doesn't like it try something with a stronger smell|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	He probably does not like the texture.

d6e11chxaa	I really really hate masculine names on girls, but if you have to, it's better in the middle. I don't like either name mentioned here because they're 'creative' misspellings of common names. Olivia James or Kayla James are a bit better, but I would use something that's more unusual and very feminine, if you must use James, like Lucille James, Odessa James, or Penelope James.|`|AA10045620	There are so many feminine names out there.  James is a nice name, but not for a sweet little girl.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No.  Stop stealing all the boy names for girls!  And please, learn how to spell.  Your child would have an impossible time with those names.  They are Olivia and Kayla.|`|miFe45quaa	Eh...Aliviah is spelled wrong, and Kaylah looks weird. I don't like James for a girl, too out there. <br>  What about Jamie?<br>  <br>  Olivia Jamie<br>  Kayla Jamie<br>  Jamie Olivia (So cute!)<br>  Jamie Kayla<br>  <br>  If you must spelled Olivia differently, Alivia is the only good option. Aliviah and Kaylah looks tacky...<br>  I think Jamie Olivia Currier is cute. Or Olivia Jamie Currier. I really like the last name :)<br>  xx|`|z6BtwSE8aa	Not really, but I supposed it's better than using it as a first name. Aliviah is horrible though, if you like Olivia spell it the proper way.|`|vwxmsUa2aa	It's ok as a middle name. I don't like Kaylah or Aliviah though.|`|nkM6wmv6aa	not at all |`|0Xl9BLOdaa	No! Why would you give your girl a boy's name?  Feminise it!  Do Jamie or Jamesina.  How is that going to make you daughter feel when she finds out that her middle name is supposed to be on a BOY?  Think about your daughter, and stop thinking about yourself!<br>  <br>  And if you're still too selfish, put yourself in her shoes.  How would *you* like to have James, Thomas, Allen, Jonathan, or Andrew in YOUR name?|`|v3IobQCgaa	I've heard of girls named James.  I also know of a girl named Jameson.  <br>  <br>  I think it's fine, if you like it.  <br>  <br>  BTW - I'm assuming you're pronouncing that one name "Olivia" right?  I have a friend whose daughter is named Alyvia.  That's another interesting variation on the spelling.|`|zBflzn2haa	I like Jazmyn James the best.  Perhaps there is a different spelling of James that you could use to make it more feminine.......Jaimes.<br>  <br>  I did like the suggestion of Jamie.  That is cute.|`|Pgsq2GfBaa	it's a male name, leave it that way.<br>  Aliviah Kelsey<br>  Aliviah Jade|`|w2szGbrTaa	I know a drag queen named Kimber James... very pretty.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	As a middle name it's very nice!|`|u0kK3RUtaa	Aliviah James sounds rad..<br>  <br>  all comes down to your last name though.. |`|tumes18Kaa	absolutely like:<br>  LEah James<br>  Noelle James<br>  Carson James<br>  Brandi James<br>  Sarah James<br>  Bridget James<br>  Ariana James<br>  Carly James (but i prefer Carly Shay)<br>  Mikayla James<br>  Spohia James<br>  Cynthia James<br>  Chelsea James<br>  Evelyn James<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|5VV0EWQVaa	Well unless you want her to be teased at school or something<br>  i mean like, half a boy?<br>  no, i don't like james as a middle name sorry|`|QTyZ5U6haa	That is a great middle name!!|`|itoWr393aa	isn't james a boys name????|`|QCqBkstdaa	no too boyish

It is very nice to do as a keepsake but i thought it requires time . Something i dont really have . Bu ti kept some stuffs like what happened in the world that day , hospital pictures and tags ( the one they give you at the hospital), outfits to come home , first shoes , first smile pictures and i used to take pics every months , shots records, growth chart, lots of small things in a box but i stopped when she was about 7 months .|`|NiZMDfTfaa	I did a memory box and I got one made from Walgreens.com with my son's picture on the top.  I have kept his hospital bands, his first outfit, his first shoes, his foot and handprints, I have written in a calendar his firsts as well, such as smiles, laughs, etc.  |`|Vzdu8OH0aa	most people do this anyway<br>  <br>  go to mothercare or type baby book into google|`|wh2hPcAAaa	mothercare do a pregnancy record book and baby record book   both very  nice it has a page in it where u can write down wot pressies u recieved and who gave them to u. and ur friends can write messages for the baby aswell,,,|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'm going to make up a memory box for my baby's first year.

If you're creative you could also make your own by collecting different supplies from Arts/Scrapbooking stores.  By making your own it's a one of a kind.
Tc23KWgzaa	Yes, it's possible.  Why don't you ask your bf if he's seen proof of this.<br>  <br>  Maybe her baby was late being born.  That would give her another week in development.  Being on her tummy may help her crawl.  My kids were rolling over around then.<br>  <br>  Don't compare Joey to this baby.  One of my kids wasn't crawling until 11months.  And he's certainly not behind.  (18yo now).<br>  <br>  If you see the baby being neglected, you need to call child services.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|MbEwgRnjaa	i know most babies crawl between 6-10 months my son is 7 1/2 months hes starting to figure out how to crawl but some babies are more advance than others|`|TJusfEnlaa	yes it possible - my son sat up on his own at 21 weeks and started crawling at 5.5 months.<br>  just because your baby is not doing these thing it doesn't mean she is a liar!!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's possible. My son was sitting up, crawling, and standing at 5.5 months. He started rolling to his stomach to sleep on his own at 3-4 months.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Yes that is possible. My son sat up unsupported at 5 months...and when we put him on his tummy he would crawl backwards.  He never slept on his tummy though.  All babies are different so they are going to do things at different times.
UbCzA2JVaa	Charlotte, Ariana was a close second, but I chose Charlotte because I love the name Charlie for a girl which can be a nickname for Charlotte!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|Y8ZmuWwgaa	Can you guess my vote? ;)<br>  <br>  Charlotte. While Audrey is lovely and I'm largely indifferent to Ariana, Charlotte is definitely my favorite. <br>  <br>  As I've mentioned before, Charlotte is my absolute favorite girls' name. It's so timeless and has unmatched grace. I love that it's feminine and dainty sounding without frills or fussiness, and remains youthful without ever sounding immature. I think it's perfect!|`|5hzCUPVUaa	I love the name Audrey. It's such a beautiful, timeless name. I also think Charlotte is lovely. I'm not fond of Ariana.|`|Hg89exnMaa	In this order:<br>  Ariana<br>  Audrey<br>  Charlotte<br>  <br>  but out of all of them i prefer Ariana(:|`|igMh0iL3aa	Ariana|`|qeT182Ooaa	Ariana|`|qqj7e64Waa	Ariana<br>  xx|`|NNki7qiFaa	Charlotte is my favorite name.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Charlotte|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Audrey|`|laddjTVvaa	Charlotte:)|`|NePgB9b2aa	Audrey and Charlotte are my two favorite girl names ever.|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I like Arianna.|`|cxhsI7tbaa	audrey!|`|HMPdnhApaa	I LIKE them all, but I LOVE Charlotte and Audrey. :)|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	Charlotte is so cute!!!!!!!!!|`|XoNd3VWzaa	Ariana or Audrey|`|HurPmgSaaa	Ariana<br>  Charlotte<br>  Audrey<br>  <br>  in that order|`|8RfmosODaa	I like Audrey and Charlotte|`|CxRJwJsraa	Audrey.<br>  <br>  Ariana is too princessy and Charlotte pretty, but lacks Audrey's sex appeal and simultaneous class.|`|fZGcufB7aa	Ariana!!!!!!!!!!|`|xLabGD6Maa	Charlotte|`|8VaSOTfnaa	Audrey...but my niece says Ariana....(I would spell it with two r's though  =))|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Wow, that's an amazingly hard choice.

w2NA1KuXaa	I think it's not healthy for the child to be renamed at all, regardless of his/her age.  For a child aged 3/4, they have been known by their name for all that time, and I think it is far too much to expect a child who has been torn away from their homeland, their language and culture, put them with strangers, and expect them to answer to a new name.  It just seems cruel to me.<br>  <br>  I think children of any age should be able to keep their name, adoptees should at least be left with that much of our beginnings.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	In my opinion to change a child's name when you adopt them robs them of their identity. IA already face the loss of their culture, the loss of their first country, the loss of their first family, and often the loss of their language as they are thrown into the language spoken by their adoptive family. To change the name of a three or four year old (who is old enought to associate their identity with their name) would be emotionally damaging and confusing to the child.|`|bHfuVh6kaa	I don't agree with changing names - even for very young children - I think it gives the message to the child that their name wasn't good enough - they go through so much change already - what's in a name?<br>  <br>  If they are old enough to be asked and give an opinion fine - but If not best left alone - or you could add some middle names - we did that for our son and he was just over a year old (not adopted from abroad though adopted from foster care)|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Well, if you adopt her, she will have your last name, your family name.  I would suggest that you NOT change her first and middle.  She can always pick a nickname that is local to your country if she wants that for herself later. By changing her name, you're saying that her culture and Heritage are not important.  You should always value her culture and make sure she understands and is proud where she came from as well as were she lives now with you.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Depends on what their name is?  Sorry don't mean to sound flippant.<br>  <br>  If it's a difficult to pronounce name or one that the child might be teased about then I would probably keep the original name as middle name(s) so they still keep it.|`|AA12127693	Why would you change a 3 to 4 year old childs name?  I believe that maybe you could shorten it or give the child a nick name and maybe add a name of your own, but this is truly too old IMHO to change a childs name.|`|6orvPrLLaa	no.<br>  <br>  my 3 year old responds to HER name. most 3 year olds respond to their name. <br>  <br>  there is no benefit in changing a child's name.|`|OLHiZ045aa	I think it would be incredibly selfish to do that.<br>  <br>  At that age they are well-aware of their name, it's part of their identity.|`|AhNkKIMlaa	i wouldn't change their first name, at that age you respond to the name you have been given, like some one said when they are older you can give them a nickname that they can choose to use.|`|aCDWwsisaa	You don't want a child, you want a pet.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Unless a child brings it up and wants to have their name changed, I don't agree with it.  Children are old enough to know their own names and that is a vital part of their identity.  It's not for the APs to say that their name is too foreign or too difficult to pronounce.  <br>  <br>  Unless there is some major compelling reason, I don't support the idea of APs changing the name of children.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Friends of my parents adopted a child from another country whose name in this country was something embarrassing. Soooo, at home they'd call her her own name AND  their loving nn for her which was "Sunshine". They'd sing to her lots of sunshine songs and when people (strangers, because their friends had already been clued in) would ask her name, they would speak up and say, "she is our little sunshine" because if they'd said her real name, it sounded like a swear. Still at home, they would interchange the real name with Sunshine which soon became Sunny. The mother said that about 3 mo. later, someone asked her name and before the mother could answer, the little girl said, "My name is Sunny" Good idea IF the name is one that would cause the child to be laughed at in our culture.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I think it's a dangerous idea. The child is gaining a new family, but has also lost so much already. Changing their name would really be an insult to him or her. Its a good way of honoring the child's past. Even if the child's past is not so great, his or her name will be the only thing they have of their past.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	My opinion is that it would say a lot about the ignorance of the Ap.<br>  <br>  Those types of people are lacking self respect and are not capable of giving it to others.<br>  <br>  Adoption doesn't mean buying a child like you would a pet even though that is the current practice.|`|B24W8w43aa	Ask them. At that age they can give you an answer.
Nux5S6oVaa	That depends, are you on a regular 28 day cycle? If so it's 14 days from the beginning is a "supposed" ovulation day...however you could ovulate 2-3 before then or a day or so after...Really hard to pinpoint an exact day.<br>  <br>  Wait 3 days if you're on a 28 days cycle, that's you're expected period date...|`|d54784ffbf5354267478c5b7043eaf8eaa	There is no way to know from the information you have given. If you know when you started your last period, count that as day 1. Then you will know what day of your cycle you are on.|`|7aa265cd932bedd8a376089a112f08ebaa	normaly  next period is about 14 days after ovulation date
8ae9CGqcaa	No, you don't need to ask your doctor to check. <br>  You will know when you're going into labour, and then while that is happening, your doctor, or a nurse will check to see how dialated you are.<br>  It's also common to be dialated about 1 cm before labour, and it's harmless. Your body is just getting ready. <br>  I know how easy it is to be so concerned with this process since you are so far along, but I'm sure you're fine. <br>  <br>  Still, feel very free to address any of your thoughts and concerns with your doctor. They won't mind, it's their job to talk about these things.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I wish you a safe labour, and a healthy baby!|`|AA10526033	drs won't usually check as it can cause early labor or infections they usually wait until around 37 wks or so when its safer. at 31 wks you probably aren't dilated and it wouldn't really matter if you were if you aren't having contractions. your dr knows what they are doing.|`|vxoWXVLKaa	They typically won't start routine checking until your 34 or 36 week check-up.  If there is reason to believe that you may be dilating sooner, ie early contractions or loss of mucous plug, then they will start checking earlier.  You can always ask for them to check while you are there too, no harm there.  Good luck!|`|Fx77zYhWaa	you shouldn't be dialated until around 36 weeks and at that point they start doing a quick vaginal exam during each appointment until you deliver.|`|rpZRlJMzaa	mine does the same thing! i am 34 weeks and 2 days and having dr's appts every 2 weeks now. and my next one he should check me! however, i am dialted 1 cm. yay!
9s6lFT82aa	thats absurd    just joking   its a really nice name   i like it|`|r7iTzPdtaa	Um, not sure what your culture is... but in English language it means "ridiculous"<br>  If you live in an english-speaking country, I wouldn't subject the child to that.|`|iqqoFZkLaa	It means ridiculous in English, give the kid a normal name, if they want to change it let them do it as adults. Don't make them suffer as your fashion victim|`|3h6B19bdaa	Sounds like a winner to me. For a middle name, how about Preposterous or maybe Keith?|`|KImktMtXaa	oh yes, its not absurd at all. wayy normaler then half the names on here|`|QfITU9aYaa	No|`|EFlX4GYOaa	I thought that was a female name?|`|pSkPC3sbaa	No, don't you know that word in the English Dictionay means Silly and Ridiculous|`|wVW7nxSzaa	Yeah!

StiIpLFoaa	It affects them because everyone is on the same page and they are engaging in the same goals and tasks. Everyone is putting in their input, observations, and ideas for techniques. It makes all the difference in the world.
67f702c23a5155f54675a8e89e6bdad8aa	 1. They become de-sensetized to violence ....so that violence seems pretty normal.<br>  <br>  2. It opens their appetite and they graduate to not just tv shows, but also computer and inter-active computer/internet games that are difficlt to nearly impossible for parents to monitor.<br>  <br>  3. Dramatic behavorial changes occur , such as rebellion, fixation on porn, displays violent behaviour, difficulty focusing on school work, if at all....and the feeling of invinceability generally occurs.|`|1p9DK04Faa	First of all they may imitate what they're seeing on the television, okay they think its okay if they're favorite character does it. Its not just television its other sources of media like magazines, especially gossip magazines. For example, go ahead and watch a BET Music Video or American Gangsters, which glorified these criminals. Which came off to me as a way of encouraging youngsters that gang violence and drugs are okay, when they really aren't. But despite all of this I believe that reinforcement at home is the most important of all, by letting your children know that it isn't okay to behave a certain way can make a difference|`|F0uLexezaa	desensitizes them<br>  most violence it directed towards women<br>  makes them think this is ok behaviour|`|PNtq2jgOaa	Depending on the type of/intensity of violence,and age and the individual child,the effects can be:    Learning that violence is okay; Traumatization; desensitizing; or no effect at all.
SMkB2LKIaa	Unfortunately, there is nothing you can really do. I know what you are talking about- I get very upset when I see people treating their children this way in public, but when it comes down to it- it's none of our business. Unless this is someone you know who is abusing their child at home, then you can't really call social services.|`|SYBfPFcDaa	There is nothing you can do. The police wouldn't be interested in stuff like that. And you can't call social services unless you know who they are or where they lived. And personally I wouldn't go over and give a piece of my mind to someone like this - because one of two things would happen:<br>  1. They might not be a bad parent but just be very stressed and at the end of their tether, and so me saying something would achieve nothing.<br>  2. If they ARE an abusive parent, all me saying something would almost certainly achieve is them taking out their anger at me upon their child as soon as they're in the privacy of their own home.|`|0FbK9qDxaa	honestly u, as a child can do nothing.Basicly paernts (some) feel that because their older and they gave birth to this child they have some ultmate regin over them and the respect gun shoots bullets only one way and guess whose holding it?(the adults) yes there are certain steps taken when an accual child abuse point is reached but like you said, when it falls short, theres technally no rule against "good decipline" so, i personaly wont physcally punish my kids or curse if their under age bu, until some poster kid for mild child abuse speaks up.....hey this is america right?"land of the free& home of the brave".....|`|XW9FqleYaa	if it keeps happening you coulod call child services, but if it only once you seen it i wouldn't.|`|c8a0fc27d021da822a52ee6103add094aa	I think it's completely out of line for a by-stander (let alone a government agency) to deem what is proper and improper disciplinary action for a parent to take. Not all spanking is abuse. And if you read the Federal Law about child abuse, you will learn that failure to act (such as letting your child throw a tantrum in the Wal-Mart checkout line). There are laws governing what one person can do to and with another - that's far enough. Next thing you know, by-standers will be saying I "abuse" my child because I don't have cable and don't buy them video games.|`|67f702c23a5155f54675a8e89e6bdad8aa	That's a big one..let me see! Try talking to the child instead, in calm kinda firm kinda playful way...or maybe a light comment to the parent...such as...huh.. girl my son is 2 and shucks he takes me to the moon and back in 60 seconds...or something funny...you judge the situation and work one of the two...it helps ease the tension for both parent and child...<br>  |`|AA11442444	It's sometimes a bit hard to report them but I understand where your coming from I also see this a bit to often, but unless you know the name of the people committing these said crimes, there's really no way that you can intervene. Which is sadly unfortunate :( |`|113FoyMFaa	Oh please.<br>  <br>  More parents need to step up and act that way to their kids.  It's worse when the parent gives in to the tantrum throwing child and hands them a toy, or coddles them because they're crying for some stupid reason.<br>  <br>  (not talking about hitting, btw.)|`|SIK58haraa	I don't know but I saw a father smack his around 6 yr old on the face for talking at the store. The kid was just talking the father smacked him and told him to calm down. It made me wanna cry but I did nothing other then stare in disbelief|`|xeXcB9UQaa	well theres physical abuse and mental abuse both are really not nice for a young child or an adult if you know this person why not talk to them she may be goin through a bad time and needs help and support exspecially if a single parent|`|u60u5EjDaa	Call DCF and report that parent.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Well, it all depends on your definition of abuse. <br>  <br>  If you mean a simple spank on the bum or on the top of the hand, than just ignore them. Spanking isn't illegal. <br>  <br>  But if you mean grabbing a child on both arms and shaking the hec out of them, hitting them across the face, kicking them, ( leaving bruises, cuts, etc) then chances are they are being abused at home, therefor, you have that choice if you feel like you should intervene or not. |`|Fpi8YePkaa	There's not much you can do unless you suspect that it is harming them child physically. Sad but true ,most businesses won't intervene just for verbal abuse unless it's really causing a scene.Now if a store manager sees anything that alarms him/her, she could call and report it.The police would act quicker to the problem.Parents do yell,scream , holler insults and correct there children as they see fit,even though it may seem harsh to another individual. If something happens in the store and needs attention right awaw, I would tell that child: were are going to the car and you will know what you did is wrong and handle it there.If a child is screaming and throwing a fit because he or she wants a toy , then I would say: you need to calm down and giving that child a small swat or slap is ok. Just not anything that draws attention to others.Talking firmly helps most times.
EQsnhon7aa	That is perfectly normal. The baby is so little that you couldn't expect to see much more. When you have your next ultrasound you will be shocked at the little person you will see inside you. By 9 or 10 weeks it looks completly like a little baby just a little bit of an alien version of a little baby. If you are really curious to see it for yourself youtube has some great ultrasound videos. I always look at them to see what my baby is doing in between my doctor visits. Just type in the search what ever week you are on for example "18 week ultrasound" Good Luck and congrats.|`|6kENjTH4aa	10-12 weeks u see arms and legs and little baby. week 20 is the real deal big baby.
TjJZqsN5aa	these butterly feelings are the baby moving.<br>  because it is so small, its not a powerful feeling when it moves.<br>  im not sure why it feels this way, it may be the amniotic fluid flowing around aswell when the baby moves.<br>  <br>  congratualtions!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	sounds like the baby fluttering in there!<br>  <br>  i keep getting attacks of anxiety. is that normal?!x<br>  x
AA11030954	TREASURE HUNT!!!! my kids love it.. and they are in the same age groups.. you can get lots of little trinkets from the dollar store and just hide them all over the place.. complete with a map.. i used to put lamp shades on their heads and give them papertowel rolls.. was sooo fun.. and it keeps them occupied for a few hours..|`|BRT2teSqaa	If their parents allow it, get them a small pet.  They can all share a rabbit, or a hamster each for the boys and girls. Or turtles, or a chamelion.  Make sure to include a cage and some food.  Kids love pets, and small pets are not too bad to take care of, and all the kids are sure old enough.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Open a savings account and put money in it.  Or get them a savings bond.  When children have more than they need, they won't appreciate adding to it.  Money later in life when they really need it will be appreciated.  |`|e3K2TIVnaa	well boys think like a boy - video games (if they have a console) or what about a movie they like, CD, does he plays a lot of sport so maybe a signed rugby jersey or something like that (not sure how much they cost)<br>  <br>  the girls i am a bit more of an expert. my sister (8) is really into the crafty stuff like drawing or painting - why not give them a gift voucher for colour me mine (place where they paint already made ceramics - or something like that and take them there yourself (aunty to niece time). what about some fun board games - a big hit in our house is Disney Trivial pursuit you find the younger ones win with flying colours it is a great family game because we have seen all the movies. another idea is twister - personally it is still my favourite party game ever! highly recommended. i know you didn't want toys but you can get some of the cutest littlest petshop toys like lady bugs etc little kids love them.<br>  <br>  I saved my favourite idea until last.<br>  i am not sure if they are readers but i read heaps when i was there age and loved "the faraway tree" series officially the best book for the age group. but if they have already got this series maybe Tashi but faraway tree is way better. <br>  <br>   if they haven't read the Beatrix Potter series (Peter Rabbit etc) you could get them that<br>  <br>  personally i would go with the faraway tree series or Beatrix potter series.|`|CxQ3XW4eaa	I think football shirts for the boys at that age are pretty cool - if they are into football - unfortunately they can be a bit costly tho :(  Remote control car? Computer Game? maybe even a cool wallet? or some credit for there mobile if they have one!! oh and maybe an mp3 / ipod player - you can get them cheap these days - boys grow up so quickly these days - its a shame but true - I used to work with boys that age and they are liking the more expensive things! typical!<br>  <br>  For the girls jewelry, make up (if allowed??) a nice bag maybe? or jewelry box, oh and maybe a diary with a lock and pen.. again they could also have a computer game, sing star maybe? if they have that console? I know the children I looked after used to love that - anything to do with animals, colour, beauty, music etc etc - <br>  <br>  Theres so much!|`|SbaPw8wtaa	My son is 10 and he loves his video games....  if they already have a house game like play station or wii just get them a new game and they will be very happy, if they don′t have, you can buy a personal game for them like a gameboy or nintendo DS. Also you can get them a really kool shirt because they are in an age where they start to care how they look in front of the others kids. I would not buy a toy, they are too old for toys, and already have many. I have to agree with the pet idea, they would love that.<br>  <br>  For the girls, there is a new movie, High School Musical 3 and the girls are very much into it right now, amazon.com has diferent toys of the movie and the new CD. Also Hannah Montana is very in too. And they have all kind of things of her, like CDs dolls, books, movies, games and you can find all this in amazon too. <br>  <br>  I hope you find the right present !|`|ljMxhE4Xaa	American Express prepaid credit card.

n2Jromq6aa	I studied political science in college and have been active in politics for years now. My children are still young (4 yrs and 18 months), but sometimes I take them to work with me if I need to just pick something up. They see all of the political goings-on at our state capital and my daughter at least seems to really enjoy it. She asks questions sometimes and I do my best to answer them in ways that she'll understand (after all she is only 4). <br>  <br>  As they grow up, I hope to show them that it is important to be an informed citizen and to participate politically because with our rights enumerated in the Constitution also come responsibilities such as voting and educating yourself on issues.<br>  <br>  I have noticed that with this past election a lot of the younger kids have gotten very involved and interested in the campaigns. My 11 year old niece and some of her friends even convinced her class to go on a field trip to learn more about government and politics. I think it's great that so many kids are becoming interested in things that affect all of our lives. <br>  <br>  And congratulations on explaining to your son how important it is to make an informed decision and supporting his curiosity.

AA11981363	I have a 25 month old that has been eating up anything and verything for the past few weeks!! and a friend of mine has a 2,5 yo daughter that is also eating like crazy!! I think is a combo of growth spurt plus they being MUCH MORE active!! My daughter is eating 5 meals a day (3 main meals and 2 snacks) only lately her 2 snacks have been slowly turning into an almost full meal too LOL. I say completely normal.<br>  <br>  I do find weird how many questions I read on here about 2 yos being picky and not wanting to eat, cause we are going through the total opposite ;)|`|s4aX6bF6aa	sounds like he's going through a growth spurt...plus he's 2 so he's no doubt a very active child...but the eating will curb itself out in due time...no reason to worry...have fun with him.|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Sounds like he is growing, mine usually do that when they are growing, and they are very healthy and extremely active, and definately not overweight.  Listen, I understand the confusion cause you also changed the bottle situation recently, and if you were very generous with the bottle perhaps he is compensating.  Just cause you stopped the bottle doesn't mean his hunger signals will change with it right away.   To be honest I think that to  limit the childs food intake without serious cause is unwarranted, so far.   Unless, the child is gaining weight rapidly which is a sign for you that his activity level does not warrant that amount of consumption.   Just make sure that  what you are giving is nutricious, and you will see pretty soon.  I don't think you have to worry.  And by the way:  What on earth is this tartism?  Excuse my ignorance.
lJ5Ao2aIaa	You should try this method, its called The Ferber Method:<br>  <br>  Ferber says you can teach your baby to soothe himself to sleep when he's physically and emotionally ready, usually sometime between 4 and 6 months of age. He recommends following a warm, loving bedtime routine and then putting your baby in bed awake and leaving him (even if he cries) for gradually longer periods of time. Putting a child to bed awake, says Ferber, is crucial to successfully teaching him to go to sleep on his own.<br>  <br>  Parents are instructed to pat and comfort their baby after each predetermined period of time, but not to pick up or feed their baby. This routine is called "progressive waiting." The suggested waiting time, which Ferber charts in his book, is based on how comfortable you are with the technique, how many days you've been using it, and how many times you've already checked on your child that night.<br>  <br>  After a few days to a week of gradually increasing the waiting time, the theory goes, most babies learn to fall asleep on their own, having discovered that crying earns nothing more than a brief check from you.|`|ybexjS2Paa	My daughter started sleeping through the whole night when she was 7 months when my son slept though since he was 5 months so all you can do is wait. Maybe when he wakes up at night just give him some water.
08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	I've been to Glade without the kids, and I've been to other festivals with and without them, and I'd say that you COULD take a baby/toddler to Glade & it would be OK, but it's not as suitable for kids as some other festivals are. With it being a dance music festival, there's a lot more drugs and it's more "messy" than some other festivals are. There don't tend to be very many kids there, so there aren't really the facilities for kids that there are at other places (I'm pretty sure there wasn't a kids area there when I went).<br>  <br>  My favourite festival for kids is the Big Chill, it's got a great range of facilities for families, from a dedicated family camping area (which is not as far to walk to the main site as some other camping areas, and is at the quieter end of the site) to a good-sized children's area with lots of activities for kids of all ages, plus lots of other child-friendly stuff going on across the site. It's more chilled out than Glade and feels safer (far fewer crazy people running round off their head!! Although, equally, the organisers aren't uptight about drugs so if anyone in your group likes to partake in that kind of thing it wouldn't be a problem...), and there are lots of people with kids so you don't feel out of place. I felt like the other festival-goers were mostly very considerate of people with kids, too. The music is always good, with a wider range than Glade but still plenty of electronica/dance music to keep you entertained if that's your preference, plus everything from jazz to hip hop to comedy to world music to keep things interesting! It's also one of the most well organised festivals I've been to; the toilets tend to be slightly cleaner (although, as with any festival, they can get pretty nasty at times!), there's not so much litter, and it seems generally well planned, which are all important considerations when you're taking kids. On top of which, it seems blessed with wonderful weather - I've been four times and it's never been a washout (a bit of rain on two occasions but nothing too bad)!<br>  <br>  The only bad thing about the Big Chill is that my kids liked the kids area so much they wanted to spend the entire time there!! But if yours is only little that probably won't be such a problem for you.|`|vhGIwzROaa	Never been to glade but ive been glast/bug jam and so on and always taken the kids/babys, so im sure you will be ok. Whats the worst that can happen?? you go home. ENJOY and have a rave for me. god bless.
1tmX7xbRaa	well honestly my husband and i had our first baby when i was 20 and he was 25. i do i wish i had waited a little longer just because there are so many things that we could have done but it's harder to do with a baby now. i think you should wait a little bit. and you should know when it's a good time for you. asking other people won't help you.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	It's very cute from the outside looking in but my advice is to give it at least 5 years and be married with your retirement savings started and a separate savings account for emergencies (like huge deductibles for health care expenses) have your cars paid off too.  IMHO, a 20 YO man does not have the maturity to be kind and responsive when a baby cries for hours for no apparent reason and it is very distressing to everyone around.  Raising children is wonderful, I started when I was 30 and I'm still healthy and youthful with 3 kids taking the bus to school this morning, life is good.  And America is going to need many healthy well-raised children to to pay taxes and  foot the bill for the deficit we're running up so I think your baby-having impulse is good for the country.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	No Hun i don't think its right your relationship doesn't sound very strong to me after reading your previous posts .. you should not have a baby <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnlSGLTeikeLknnG..wXazQhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090216075821AA84ySp">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Mwhclezaaa	How long have you been together?  Wait at least 1 1/2 years & enjoy it being just the 2 of you!  If you feel unfulfilled at the moment a baby will only make things worse.|`|AA11975901	no.. just have patience for 2-4 years....|`|vCq3dR40aa	Finish college or technical school first.  Also, unless you desire no breaks and no evenings out for the next 6 years or so and a greatly increased chance your baby will grow up and enter the prison system, consider whether boyfriend 2.0 (Entertainment system) will be an acceptable husband 1.0 (Operating system)  Think computer lingo<br>  <br>  Having a baby is a life decision, not a short term decision.  Not only will you stop everything and raise them for the next 18-20 years, you will support them emotionally for the rest of your life, perhaps economically too.|`|wL8kRuztaa	I just want you to know that people change a lot during their 19's.There are lots of things to experience in life. Before you become pregnant, you need to ask yourself if there are things that you want to do in your life, and how would a baby affect that. Once you have a child, you can plan on it depending on you for at least the next 20 years. There is no correct age to get pregnant, but you need to be sure that you are ready for it, financially and emotionally.But i still suggest best age of getting pregnant is after you complete your 20. Good luck to you.|`|93Ld9X04aa	if you have to ask then NO you are not ready. when the time is right there will be no questioning or logic answer to put to it. you will just know "Now" is the time. you won't have to ask yourself or anyone else it will be like breathing, it will just come naturally.<br>  but as for now, think about everything you and your boyfriend do...parties. school, work, drink, smoke, movies, your eating habits, and how much debt do the two of you carry, look into your health insurance...i just had a baby boy in october the total damage was OVER $12,000 for JUST ME...luckily my husband has amazing insurance so it cost us little to nothing. and as far as "owning" make sure you aren't confusing that with "having a loan for ownership" you are young enjoy BEING a child before you have a child.|`|hHS7FISqaa	If you a really serious about this, I would definitely reconsider. I was 20 when I had my son, and it was and still is really hard at times. There is no one for you to go to when you need something for that baby that is all on you! <br>  Think about how much it would be to buy diapers, food, clothes, toys... everything they need then on top of that daycare. try at least 200 a week for an infant, and that's cheap. Not only that but medical insurance, you can not always rely on the state. <br>  Also think about your freedom, because with a baby you will have no freedom. That baby will have to go every where you go. A Trip to Target use to take me 10 minutes(quick trip) now takes me at least an hour.<br>  I would really think hard about this one...|`|9tPMUAcbaa	if u got da money n patience i dont see why not..|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	not yet....wait awhile longer
oN9UNGZfaa	I fell the same way since you have PCOS maybe you should try OPK test you can test every day and then it tell's you when you ovulate so you get to pee on a stick every day or twice a day (that's what I did din't want to miss my surge ) and you can get them at walmart 20 sticks for under $20 I sound like I'm selling something he he and then you might not be so obsessed about the pregnany test because after you ovulate it takes 11-14 days or more to get a + pregnancy test GOOD LUCK BABY DUST !|`|yznZqcznaa	Haa haa yea I have this too.  I peed on over 20 sticks in my 2 week wait, however that week wait turned into 4 weeks and I was pregnant.  My husband had no idea I was peeing on all the sticks and when I told him I was pregnant he thought, well when did you test.  He said he did not like that I was secretive about it.  I said sweetie if I told you every time I took a test it would be every day. Now he has some idea of my obsession.  Hopefully I wont have to pee on a stick for a long time.<br>  <br>  Also I started using the dollar store test so now I dont feel bad about it.|`|NaJPIOheaa	Your testing when your ovulating or hpt?<br>  <br>  I have an obsession of taking about 5 hpt a month, but i go to the dollar store, they're only a buck!!<br>  <br>  If you have pcos and don't know when your ovulating, i would really suggest OPK's if you arnet already using them, another thing that lady's take who have irregular cycles(including me) is agnus castus vitex, it regulates periods and ovulation, and works wonders!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|PwhrTNZraa	OMG I was a complete POAS-aholic, and our dollar stores here in Canada don't sell hpt's.  I was buying them and opk's in bulk online.  I finally talked myself into NO TESTING because I was fed up with TTC and that's the month I got my BFP.  Even then, I bought 5 tests because I just couldn't believe my eyes!!<br>  <br>  PS:: I never told my hubby I was testing.....ever.  I never told him about opk testing either, or informed him much at all about ovulation schedules and the like....I didn't want him to feel like we were doing it just because it was time, and I didn't want him to start feeling like a piece of meat or machinery that was being told to do it on command lol.  This way, when I finally got my BFP, it was a big surprise for him :)|`|IhhvG1Cnaa	ME!<br>  i have pcos, dont have a clue what going on in my mestrual cycle or even if it bloody exists anymore lol<br>  <br>  i feel like i need to test all the time... i have a headache =O, might be a sign of bfp, test....<br>  <br>  i havent tested in about 3 months now cuz am holding on sooo much and it is sooo hard!<br>  <br>  Hang on in there hunny!!!<br>  <br>  Baby Dust to all TTC!!! x x x x x x x|`|75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	When my husband and I were trying and I knew I was supposed to start my period soon, I would get obsessed with wanting to pee on the sticks. He would actually have to hide them from me so I wouldn't use them too soon and end up having to buy more, lol. You're not alone, don't worry!!|`|iyizhTCcaa	Try and involve your partner. Get him to hold the 'stick', talk about why you want to do it. Let him into your world. Express yourself.|`|3PyCIZh2aa	A woman's biological clock is an interesting thing.  A lot of women would understand exactly how you are feeling.  Myself included.  Don't worry and tell your partner not to as well.  I agree with the first poster, use the dollar store tests and keep testing.  I'm sure you'll stop when you get the desired result! heheheh :)|`|d54784ffbf5354267478c5b7043eaf8eaa	If you are going to be obsessed with it, at least go to the Dollar Store so you aren't wasting more money than you need to.|`|sS2Xkh1jaa	try not to think about it for a while <br>  change ur concentration in some other thing|`|5QdZDhxiaa	me too

You buy baby diapers, and a whole bunch of different candy bars, you melt each candy bar and put one in each diaper (so it looks like baby poop lol) and you pass each one around the tables and each table has to try and guess what kind of candy bar is in the diaper. The can smell it, touch it, anything (except taste it for obvious reasons) to try and figure it out.

AA12228565	If its going to happen it will happen don't stress.  I had a miscarriage at 7 week.  I did nothing wrong.|`|3kydegQJaa	DON'T STRESS!!!  You need to stay happy!  Stress will affect the baby, so try not to worry so much. <br>  Eat spinach!  It's high in folic acid, which is really good for you during pregnancy.  <br>  Don't lift anything heavy, and walk everyday. <br>  But mostly, try really hard not to stress.  The chances of miscarriage are low, you're body is young and strong, and more than capable of carrying this baby to term! Congratulations!|`|WQ3omiJUaa	The majority of miscarriages are of nature's making. A smoker and drinker can carry full-term and deliver a healthy baby while someone who lives by every word of "What to Expect While Expecting" can miscarry at 6 months (although risk of miscarriage decreases tremendously after month 3). It's basically not in your hands. If you're religious, see it as in God's hands. If you're not, see it as in nature's hands. Think positively; the power of positivity can be startling. My advice is to sit back, enjoy the pregnancy, and just hope for the best. Take care of yourself, but don't over-worry. I did everything right and almost lost my baby at 33 weeks and had to have an emergency C-section. This should be a time of peace and soul-searching for you. Free your mind. Congrats mommy, best of luck to you!|`|AA11120998	Do not run, jump, eat spicy food, herbs, caffeine, do not smell chemicals like: oinsol bleach things that are used for the house to clean. Let your husband or bf do all that. Get lots of rest make sure to walk but not to much like an a hour a day you can say. Avoid any smoking even if its your family member or friends smoking avoifd it same dont drink. There is nothing wrong with you drinking a little caffeine just a cup a day of caffeine no more than that. Do not eat alot of salty food or oily foods....Well if you like to know more just ask your doctor they give you a sheet or book of what you can and cant eat. You can also go to your local library and check out books of pregnancy to help you along your pregnancy.Thats what I did now I am 38 and ready to pop lol!|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Stop stressing, that's what you can do. Try some yoga and valium. Wow, I'm excited for you, babies are lovely x
WQ3omiJUaa	Like everyone else has said, stay away from the obvious things like smoking and alcohol. Taking a prescription prenatal vitamin is crucial, making sure it is high in folic acid. Store bought vitamins aren't high enough, and it is important at early stages for baby's development. They should give you the prescription at your appt. Keep on exercising however you have been, don't start anything new that's strenuous. Eat enough for two now. Your body will send you crave signals of what it needs. Enjoy your pregnancy, and congrats. :)|`|Vs17ceYKaa	stay away from fish thats high with mercury like scod and tuna. take a vitamin and my dr told me to take a omega 3 vitamin with my prenatal|`|jvOixxxyaa	Congratulations! Use common sence- don't smoke, drink, do drugs, or eat to much junk. Be gentle on your body. Start a prenatal vitamin. You can buy them over the counter.

I like the fact that you want your daughter's middle name to mean "rainbow".  That's very sweet and thoughtful. However, it is different. And it may be difficult to find a first name to go with it. But it is unique, just like your little girl will be. So don't get rid of it. Just play with names. Go to baby name websites that lists thousands of names. <br>  <br>  Here's one:<a href="http://www.babynames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/</a> <br>  <br>  You should be able to find many options there.  It also depends on what your last name is and how it flows with the first name. Like for example, Olivia Itzel  sounds beautiful for a little girl to me. But if your last name is a little weird sounding, you may have to go with a two syllable name. If you really like it, I say use it, and your little girl will wear it well. Who knows, you may see that name popping up all over the place once your daughter has it.  It may be the next most popular name!|`|8Rg4WODraa	"If you like it, then no other person opinion matters."<br>  <br>  Whoever said that is a retard. Sorry, that would be an insult to the mentally challenged. I mean that in strictly the offensive, derogatory term towards those do things idiotically but were born normal.<br>  <br>  Obviously, your daughter will resent her own name if other kids make fun of  her. Remember to take into account not just your own opinion but some advice from others.|`|sbEY601saa	nooo. dont. she will get teased in school. :p|`|zcwLJVZgaa	What about Mackenzie Itzel.<br>  Jennifer Itzel.<br>  Ashley Itzel.<br>  Storm Itzel.<br>  Rayne (Raine?)

XEiIYjT7aa	You would be ovulating around this time, but the sure way to know by looking at your discharge is if its like "egg whites". It would be the consistency of sperm, basically. If you put it on your two fingers, you should be able to stretch it between them. This is the right consistency for sperm to travel through. If it's watery or sticky you either missed your ovulation or its too early. Watch it for the next couple of days, and baby dust to you!!! |`|5Lcgfvjraa	If you have a typical 28 day cycle you would ovulate yesterday or today...so it seems likely.

You should check out yourdays.com, I use this to track my cycles, it tells me when I am ovulating and when to expect my next period. It also lets you chose if you are trying to conceive a boy or girl....we are trying for a boy so we are to BD on or after ovulation for the best chance to conceive a boy.
LL2dgYMUaa	he may do my now husband and i were only seeing each other for 6 mths when i fell for my first it took a few weeks of not talking but we did sort it out and now are married with our 5th baby on the way lol. it can go either way but what really matters is how you feel and that you are not pressured by him into making a decision you regret. if you were excited then my suspicions are that you want this baby. Don't let his reaction take away how you feel about this baby if he does not come round then you can do it alone. at the end of the day he had unprotected sex with you and is as responsible for the resulting pregnancy as you.give it time and don't make any rash decisions.|`|mygpnrK1aa	I'm sure he will come around. It may take awhile, so be patient. I'm sure when he sees your baby he will change his mind.

You need to stay united for the sake of your baby!|`|SbfUlSOxaa	honestly i think their is a possible chance that he will be.. he probably doesn't want to believe it right now because he is probably not ready but then you see all of these other girls the guys did that to them but they end up coming around because its their kid and they know they should be helping. at least you told him you took your responsibility and told him before it got to late before you start to show...if he really truly cares and is the right guy and really will care about the baby then he will be around! honestly i will be praying for you.

And I hate to tell you this, but having kids is quite the OPPOSITE of selfish.  You have to devote your time to them, make sure that their needs are taken care of first and ensure their well-being and safety at all times.  <br>  You aren't ready for a kid yet.  If the only reason that you're thinking about becoming pregnant is to escape your parents, you might as well wait.  Because once you have a child and can't handle it, guess who you'll be calling?  Mom and Dad.|`|SCdxhBzvaa	do you want to finish school,cause with a child that's going to be a little impossible, Don't you like to go out and hangout with your friends or even with your bf. Because once a child comes in to the picture it stops being all about you and now your life will revolve around that child's life. Can you afford to move out and still go to school. We never notice how expensive it's to move out until we actually do it and let me tell you it's really darn expensive. I love kids myself  and even though about having some myself but I ask a family member to let me keep their  7 month old for a weekend and after that it was a done deal. I knew I wasn't ready. They really require a lot of attention and you can't just get up and go like I'm sure you are used to.If you and your bf can afford to move out and still continue your education then go ahead because we all are entitled to learn from our own mistakes. Just be prepared to come home and cook dinner, clean up the place, do laundry, and pay bills (that's the hardest one).You should really hold off on the baby because once he's here there's no returning him.

WQ3omiJUaa	It's not good for you or the baby. It's not going to have any outwardly obvious affect on the child once she's born, but she can feel when Mommy is so distressed. It sounds like you know what's best for you to do. As someone that went through a similar situation less a year ago, I advise you to do what you have to do and get the support from your family. Find peace with yourself, even if that means leaving the father. It WILL create temporary distress, you just have to focus on tolerating it and getting through it. Best case scenario, you go back to your family and finish school and get a good start for you and your daughter's future, and maybe in the meantime the father will get his act together. Either way, you're strong enough to get through this. Do it for your daughter and for yourself. Someone told me, "You can't take care of someone else if you can't first take care of yourself."<br>  If he creates volatile situations, it would probably be in your daughter's better interest to not know much of her father than to be subjected to a rocky environment. Congrats mommy. I hope you find your right path. Look within yourself.|`|0MUvGlHkaa	its not good that your sad all the time but his friend died and you seem more content about how he should be more supportive towards you.I think you both need to Support each other. not only is your circumstances making you said but your pregnancy hormones wont either so both of you should be working together|`|F8GJdplRaa	his friend died and you are stressed out by his behavior and are wanting to walk out?  i dont get this.  be supportive of him, i know you are also going through a tough time but you need to be more mature and be there for him and love him through his problems not just when things are good for you.  this is why teenagers should not get pregnant, they are too young to manage all the problems that come up.  but since you are pregnant hang in there, and be nice to him, try and go out somewhere and make him happier. then you too will be happy. dont think of leaving your partner for such small issues.|`|srl4RiaVaa	YES, any type of stress that could increase your blood pressure could potentially harm ur unborn child! When ur blood pressure rises it puts stress on the baby! Don't worry about him, trust me been in your shoes once before and u have someone who will unconditionally love u and she will be the sparkle in ur eyes for the rest of ur life and if he cared about this child or u he would try and at least not stress u out so much until the baby gets here!

Because it will feel what your feeling!|`|ks3ywlvbaa	If your body is constantly in a state of stress, it can cause the parasympathetic nervous system to go into fight or flight mode, which directs blood flow away from "unnecessary" body parts such as your stomach, immune system, and your uterus. If your body stays stressed out, you'll be directing blood flow away from your uterus, and your unborn baby, depriving it of oxygen and nutrients. <br>  <br>  It's alright, and normal to be stressed out every once in a while, but if you find yourself constantly stressed out, you may want to consider doing something to de-stress yourself, maybe consider prenatal yoga?|`|o8ZAtmQ3aa	sweetie men are oblivious to things like feelings. and yes the stress is very bad for the baby. remember however you feel affects the baby. will leaving him really ease ur stress? or will u be crying more because of it. try to find different outlet to calm you down or put you in a happier mood. even if its late at nite.....long showers will help calm you.if it gets worse or if hes still a jerk after the be by is bord then i say get out. having a bad relationship is not how you want your daughter to think thats the way is supposed to be. you have to set an example for her early on. best of luck to you an you little angle|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Well, it's not good to be stressed out, but it is honestly harder on you than the baby.  With all the hormones going on, MOST women get stressed and upset and cry a lot during their pregnancies.  I had a few blow out fights with my husband and had him leave for a business trip overseas for a month (during which I was bawling on the phone to him a few days a week).  You are dealing with exceptional stress, but I think your baby will be OK.  However, if it's putting too much stress on you, maybe let him know that during the pregnancy all of this is too much and you need to just be somewhere you can focus on all the baby and keeping healthy for her.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Your daughter needs you and if this relationship with her father is causing problems, you won't be there for her as you should.  17/23 and you're still in high school, right?

Romeo and Juliette have always been quite popular and I've heard of a few people named Lysander. Elizabeth is a popular name. Just find something you like and go with it.

EQsnhon7aa	I have had a medical abortion before with the pills so I would never try to make this decision harder on you than it already is but sweetie you are already 13 weeks. Why didn't you get it done earlier if that is what you wanted. At 13 weeks the procedure will be very painful emotionally and pysically too. 13 weeks is a baby already. I don't know what else to say but just think it over a little more. It is about $600 though depending on where you live and you need a driver because you will be out of it after because of the medication.|`|AA12275027	this should be in the womans health section.  women in the pregnancy section for the most part want their children and don't want to see questions like this.  it's really insensitive.  <br>  <br>  please reconsider the life that is in you.  put it up for adoption insead of terminating it.  it will be worth the pain of telling your parents because you will be able to hold your head high knowing that you let your baby have a life.  do you know how many couple's out there who would love to have your baby, who would love to have the opportunity to adopt your baby.  it's not a bunch of cells, your baby has arms and legs, fingers and toes...there is no denying this life...please don't just please don't...please!|`|nZPGdcKJaa	$400-$1,000 depending on your income (most places wont take personal checks)<br>  They can't stop you from driving, but they prefer you have someone else drive you.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Between 300-1500 dollars depending on where you live, etc. <br>  <br>  You will not be allowed to drive yourself from the procedure, get a ride.|`|0MUvGlHkaa	That depends on which state you are in but i do recommend you get someone else to drive after the termination you wont be able too|`|5lmGvQzQaa	$600 bucks average, if you live in california or florida|`|V1x2UJpMaa	$300-$1000.

PtqN5WM3aa	I don't think your wife will be up for that, no matter how angry you are. ;P<br>  <br>  It's sickening, annoying, insane and ridiculous so, quite frankly, I say complain away till the cows come home. If enough people complain, maybe someone will get the message that no one needs that many kids. Not even Angelina Jolie, and she isnt actually giving birth all the time.<br>  <br>  If you MUST complain about something else, can you make it about why chocolate isn't a diet food, when we all know it should be.

vygYFdsSaa	I'm pretty sure your stomach is more on the left. You get much more gassy during pregnancy hence the growling/bubbling noises. Oh the joy hahaaha|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Its normal to get gassier in pregnancy, that's what it sounds like you're experiencing. Your stomach is on the left.|`|POsgMHhLaa	your belly growling could be a result of a number of things, being pregnant for the second time round I can tell you that it is normal<br>  <br>  make sure it's not because you are hungry,lol<br>  if you are far enough for your baby to be moving, it is because the infant is moving around in the amniotic fluid<br>  <br>  if you are not far enough it is probably because of your body rapidly producing more blood and amniotic fluid in your belly<br>  <br>  also as your baby grows it shifts your intestines upwards into your ribcage, movement causes bubles in your belly|`|AA11120998	Its noraml girly! From now on your going to get alot of that because you are eating for 2! Which means when you eat you might feel empty sometimes. Because te baby might be getting more than you! lol That what happens to me I eat and eat and feel empty and still here my stomach growling lol! its all part of pregnancy dont be alarmed! trust me I know Im 39 weeks and still here the growling and empty feeling in my stomach! lol|`|HQgS2P4Baa	i could hear water squishing sounds with my daughter, because she was moving and my insides where moving too, could be the same thing|`|K7SFaYEHaa	you might be giving birth to Zule

I was 35.2 weeks pregnant and dialated. My babies were premature but i survived. If you have an early labour, dont stress. Just take it slowly and get to the hospital. Use the techniques from the prenatal class and take big deep breaths. Everything will be fine and also the baby, if it is premature, will need a bit more time in the hospital but you will feel really special after you have your baby because you have just brought a little child into the world. Good Luck!!!|`|vxoWXVLKaa	I was never so lucky.  I would've done anything to go into labor at 37 weeks.  My first was induced 2 days late and my second was a whole day early lol.  Good luck, being dilated at 34 weeks is a good sign.
LbkLg4RFaa	Moisturiser, chocolates, good book, small bottle of wine, foot and hand cream just little things to help her relax.<br>  <br>  Also you could make her a baby-sitting voucher where you offer your services for a night or a few hours so she can get some sleep.|`|J9QUjetqaa	Some nice lip glosses or moisturizer.<br>  Snacks are always good. Especially if she's going to be nursing- she will be hungry!<br>  Some nice chocolates or a gourmet hot chocolate mix. <br>  Fuzzy socks or slippers<br>  A book or two, or a dvd- despite what people say about not having any time to yourself, the first few weeks/months the baby will be sleeping a lot and it can actually be quite boring.

Of course, you need to get an order for child support once the baby is born.  But him buying you whatever you craved a few months ago is NOT a reason to stay with someone.  Do you want your son to think it's appropriate for a guy to treat his girlfriend that way?  He will think that this is normal if you think it is normal.  |`|GzvLG6x5aa	Stop "trying to make peace" by calling him. It obviously doesn't work. <br>  The only way for peace is to not have any contact with this man at all - he's not exactly a peaceful person and he's a danger to your child, now as well as when it's born.|`|kc7cEcMgaa	go to your nearest, wic office or go to the family planning place. if you need money then try going to the health care department. and stop by the law office court house on child supoort

I said it was HIS father's day today, and he was so happy!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Our beautiful daughter is 24 months now.<br>  <br>  We miscarried recently, and I'd told him in another cute way when we found out we were pregnant again.

It's a nice memory, and hopefully we can conceive again soon.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Well when I found out that I was pregnant this time with twins my husband had just left for Iraq and I had no way to call him. So I got a box ready and ordered a shirt that said "honey its twins" and sent it to him. <br>  A couple weeks later I got an email saying that he couldn't believe it and he was super excited. and he sent a picture that his buddy took when he opened the box.<br>  I am due with twins in December and my husband is coming home from Iraq November 15th. |`|0OTV0a4Zaa	the first time i took a test while he was about to go for a nap, he yelled out as a joke "am i a daddy yet"? as he asked the test turned out positive and i said yes, and walked into the bedroom with the test and he grabbed it off of me and looked and his face went as pale as a ghost and i thought he was going to pass out.sadly i miscarriaged. i am pregnant again and this time i started feeling pregnant and did a test it was a bearly visible positive and we sat there arguing if i was pregnant or not, a blood test confirmed i was, we were both very scared about miscarriaging again so we didn't get excited.but im now 12 weeks and he has now started to get excited and happy about it.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	My hubby and I were getting scared that he may be infertile...<br>  We we're only trying for a few months but there were other reasons lol. <br>  <br>  So we got back from the store..and I grabbed my test to go pee on it.....expecting the negative sign.

We said we were "neither trying nor preventing." After a year of nothing happening, we really weren't expecting anything to happen. I got a call from my mom (who lives out of state) one weekend and she told me my brother and his wife were expecting their first, and then she asked, "Well what about you?" And I was like, "What?" And she asked if I was pregnant, so I was like, "Well, I don't think so, but I guess I can't tell you for sure til after Monday when my period is due." I don't think she knew I wasn't on BC. Monday came and went without a period but I didn't think much of it because I've often been off a day or 2, and I was a couple days late on my PMS symptoms so I was expecting my period to be 2 days late. But I had a ton of pregnancy tests because I bought them cheap in bulk from www.early-pregnancy-tests.com, so Tuesday morning I was like, "Why not?" and I tested. And it was positive! I was super shocked but wanted to wait to tell my husband in person so I could see his reaction. So I spend the entire morning waiting for him to come home on his lunch break, trying to process it. I took a picture of the pregnancy test on my phone and sent it to his phone right when he walked in the door. I couldn't keep the nervous smile off my face so I kept my back turned making him sandiwiches while he opened it. He saw the picture and was like, "What is this?" and I said, "What do you think it is?" and he was like, "Are we pregnant?" and I just looked at him with this weird smile and nodded. Even though we wanted kids "at some point" we were kind of scared to officially try which is why were just kind of leaving it up to God, and I didn't know if my husband would just be freaked out when I told him the news. But instead, he got the same weird smile on his face and he came and hugged me and we got to be happy about it together. Then he insisted I call my mom at work to tell her so we put her on speakerphone and when I told her I was pregnant she just said, "I knew it!" I asked why she thought I would be when I didn't think I would be and she said that when my brother told her he was expecting, it reminded her of when her and her sister had babies on each other's due dates 9 days apart, and that she had "mother's intuition."<br>  <br>  And now my sister-in-law and I are a week and a half apart, at 7 and almost 7 months pregnant, and my (not in-law) sister just found out a couple weeks ago that she is pregnant with her 3rd! My other brother is unmarried so now he's the only one of us 4 kids without a baby on the way. =)|`|OjHFN4imaa	After almost puking while getting my kids out the door I decided it was time to test. After the kids and hubby left, I called my sis in law for her second test. She has just found out the week before..LOL I went over, picked it up and came home to pee on it..BFP!!!<br>  <br>  I called him on his cell, he was on a service call in a loud shop and I said you need to hear this..he said ok let me call you back when I drive back to the shop. He called me back and I asked him.."So what are you doing mid January?" He says "I don't know honey, that's kinda far away". I said "OK DADDY...we'll see how busy you will be!" I laughed and laughed..he caught on quick and said "What have you and my sister planned?"<br>  <br>  Here's the kicker..Within the next 3 weeks we found out that his other sister is expecting and well as his brother's wife too!! So we have babies due on Jan 7, Jan 14(us), Jan 28 and Feb 16..LOL 4 babies in 7 weeks!!!<br>  <br>  Congrats on this new phase of your life!

We've only been married 2 months and planned on waiting to have kids for a few more years to just enjoy each other. So we were NOT happy.<br>  <br>  We were both pretty stressed all weekend, and then my husband said, "Lets take another test."<br>  <br>  We took another test and again, it read, "Pregnant."<br>  <br>  My amazing husband looked at me with his hopeful eyes and said, "Wanna have a baby?"<br>  <br>  I just smiled and cried at the same time and said, "Ok, lets be parents."<br>  <br>  And even though this is our first kid and we've only been married 2 months, we're both happy about it now.|`|igPBuDHkaa	when i was pregnant with my first daughter i never knew at all we werent trying we only got back together after not seeing eachother for a year it was boxing day when we started going back out and about a month later he told me i was pregnant i told him i wasnt and he said i was i said i wasnt cause my period is due so on my 17th birthday yes my 17th lol we did a pregnancy test and i came out off the toilets and he said well and i said look in my bag and he had the biggest smile ever on his face went to the doctor and told me i was 6-7weeks pregnant lol on the 15th oct i had a gorgeous little girl and he was right by my side when he first seen her he was in tears with my second daughter we were ttc for about a year and i had problems with being told i was having a m/c which i wasnt and i give birth again to a gorgeous little girl with my partner right beside me again and in tears we are ttc baby number 3 with no joy as yet but when i do fall pregnant am gonna have to think of something that will shock him lol |`|tVjXZCaoaa	How cool!! :o) Personally, I have never been able to keep it a secret long enough to wait to tell my hubby that I was pregnant... but one of my friends did this and I thought it was super cute!!<br>  <br>  Her hubby was at work when she found out she was pregnant.  So she kept the pregnancy test and put it in the oven, along with a bun.  When her hubby came home she asked him to check on dinner in the oven.  When he opened the oven door he just about had a heart attack, LOL!  She also had a shirt made up about a month or two prior to getting her BFP that said, "We have a bun in the oven!  Baby ____ is on the way!" with a picture of an oven and a bun.  I thought that was pretty clever!
0ke2zRg4aa	Are you that stupid? If you're still together isn't it obvious he still likes you. I don't know why since you're so dense.|`|dQcPV4Rqaa	Well unfortunately your decision to have sex at 15 years old is absolutely insane...I don't care how long you waited...having sex at that age is a horrible mistake...You are not nearly old enough to be having sex...what if you become pregnant? Please don't tell me you are using protection..there are millions of babies that were conceived using protection !! If you are on birth control pills then you are damaging your health way before your time. Birth Control pills cause blood clots and stokes later in life....<br>  <br>  What were you thinking? High School relationships rarely make it past High School...Even if they do the success rate is very low...No doubt you will be with several boys before your High School days have ended..Not a great start....<br>  <br>  Did he want to get into your pants?  Well Duh! <br>  <br>  Does he actually care for you? Possibly in the way a teenager cares about another teenager....<br>  <br>  Is it actual love? Highly unlikely<br>  <br>  Does he respect you? Do you feel respected or do you feel used sometimes? I think you are doubting his respect for you and that is why you ask this question !!<br>  <br>  Here is what you should do....STOP having sex with him immediately..If you keep seeing him then you need to make it clear that the sex is over..See if he stays with you under those conditions. If he respects your decision to wait until you are older to resume sex, then he really cares for you...If he moves on to another girl then you are better off without him...<br>  <br>  Good Luck !!  Be Strong and take back your life.. If you continue in the direction you are going now..You are headed for heartbreak...It could destroy your whole life...(especially if you end up pregnant) Be wise...<br>  <br>  |`|3MwyejO7aa	Not to preach, I left my soapbox at home - promise.<br>  <br>  When I started college this past year, lots of girls a lot older than you got caught up making decisions just like you.<br>  <br>  Long story short, the only time when it is appropriate for two people to make sexual decisions is when they are man & wife.<br>  <br>  I swear I am not a religious nut job, but I can tell you from experience that even adults struggle with the heartache that a bad decision can bring. If I were you, I would end the sexual side of my relationship and build it more towards the personal side.<br>  <br>  When you do get married, you want to still be able to offer your whole self to your husband right?<br>  |`|kkM8vFfKaa	Don't worry sweetheart. He most likely did not want in your pants. I really don't think any guy would stick around a whole year just to get in bed with a girl. TRUST me, there are soo many other girls who would be willing to have sex on the first date. And if that's what he wanted then he would have dumped you and gotten a ****. Him waiting for when you're ready shows that he has respect for your body and feelings, and that you're worth that whole year of waiting.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to all the others who say that's all he wanted. No guy would wait around just to have sex when there are plenty of sluts in this world who would be willing to give it to him.<br>  He loves you :)<br>  Good luck|`|GBSO1Efraa	If he wanted just sex, he wouldn't have waited a whole year to have it with you.  Obviously he loves because normally if you tell them you are not comfortable or that you want to wait, they will start acting funny and say things like "baby, it's the right time now.  I love you"  and other things to make you change your mind.  If you was to keep your same answer after he tries getting it from you, he would have left you and even bother with waiting especially for a whole year.|`|l3L5eYj4aa	Pants.  You're a sucker and should never have done it till marriage...|`|QZtU3ULuaa	well only you will know this as we cant see how he acts around you. boys by nature think about sex a lot especially at this age but that doesnt mean he doesnt care for you. if you feel there was pressure or that he just wants it all the time when you are together then you know the answer. |`|OGAW7C2haa	He did it becaouse he loves u.<br>  guys wouldnt wait for a whole yr to have sex.<br>  that means he respect u and care about how u feel.<br>  and most guys i know when they had sex, they dump there gf.<br>  since u guys r still together, i think he is not a guy that only care about sex|`|WLg3VzBkaa	I'm a guy and I know how we think. Women just think they know how we think...So, yes I'm sure you and your bf have a 'nice' relationship. However, by having sex at such a young age you have seriously stacked the odds against yourselves. Stop the sex and see what happens....High school relationships fail because people grow up and move on. Only time will tell. |`|nuNlV9M7aa	I think waiting for you for a year is proof enough. He's still with you now isn't he?<br>  He didn't ditch you as soon as he got into your pants did he?<br>  There's no need to doubt him, sounds like a keeper.|`|cpmZmw8Kaa	If he's stayed with you that long it's probably because he genuinely loves and cares for you.<br>  <br>  Now the crappy part, you're in high school, and 'high school sweethearts' rarely last.|`|WMkKqXqlaa	because he loves you, clearly.|`|yHC04V6uaa	LOVE AND RESPECT<br>  GOOD LUCK !!|`|lck2hBSJaa	you know the answer to this. use your brain.<br>  |`|B66gQPXTaa	If you're still together then he's not with you to get in your pants. If he was only with you for that reason he would've left you as soon as you let him get in your pants, since he would've achieved his purpose. |`|XAXWGvNdaa	if he waited  that means he loves you! Dont listen to the other people if he jsut wanted to take your virginity he would of left you a long time ago|`|6AyEpCHBaa	sorry to say.... even though he waited it doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't want to get in you pants....

High School Musical... if you like that, then it would be cool, but I know my little sister is also 12 turning 13 and she thinks she's too cool for HSM. I think it would be cool to either have your party at home or a friends house where they have the game DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) or Guitar Hero/Rockband. With some cool music in the background and fun games. <br>  If that idea doesn't work, see if one of your parents could take you to a Pool Hall and play some pool and play the arcade games there.<br>  Or go bowling!<br>  <br>  That stuff is always a ton of fun.

soN9mlJXaa	If the mother wants the child to be Canadian and they are willing go follow through with Paperwork so that they may legally stay in Canada then there should be no problem with it.<br>  <br>  I would do it if things were planned accordingly, If neither parent acts responsibly before making the decision I would try to encourage them out of it.. It sounds like it could be a potentially devastating situation if the child were to be born in Canada and Mother and Father were forced to leave back to America... <br>  <br>  For me to make that decision though I'd need to know more about citizinship laws and learn more about Canadian laws.|`|C2sZREuAaa	I would.

xi7mq1xGaa	If you can afford not to work, then I 100% believe that you should stay at home with your kids. I'm a teacher, and nothing anyone says can convince me that anything is better for a child than having a loving, interested parent at home with them during the first few years. I've seen far too many naughty kids start school who have spent most of their lives in some form of childcare, and I really believe it has affected them. They'll get the message that you have to work hard for a living from their father who is working. The message they need from you is that you always have time for them.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Well I think you answered you question.  If you don't enjoy your job and you can afford to stay home then why wouldn't you stay home.  Your children are so young that the message of working hard is not something they will understand at this point.  You staying home and taking care of them is working hard.<br>  <br>  And if you really think working outside the home is important in your life (which is completely understandable)- then why not quit your job and take sometime to find another job that you would really enjoy.  You might want to go back to school and take some courses that would help you get the job that you love.<br>  <br>  For me personally I think one of the most important lessons to teach our children is whatever you do (stay at home, or work or both) you should do what you love.  Only then will people find true happiness.  And true happiness is really the most important goal in life.|`|Z6JnJN4Daa	I personally couldn't keep a job once I got married. I felt like my home was my job and that I had to keep up with the cleaning and meal making. If I was working, I was taking away from my family. If I had to work, I had to work. There was a time after I had my daughter where I had to work. I was 2 weeks post-partum, could hardly walk and I had to take a job. I got fired from all the stress! I couldn't function at work and I hated my job. It bought us some diapers and paid our past due phone bills at least. If you absolutely don't have to work, stay at home. It'll save you money on gas, lunches out, and you can give your children a one on one experience they can never get at daycare. My mother in law worked (single parent her whole life!) and her kids were in daycare. Constantly sick, performing terribly in school, acting out for attention, and their mother goes out and avoids them at all costs when she doesn't work. That's a very unloving relationship there! My mother didn't have to work. She stayed at home until I was 10. I was fed home cooked meals every night. Never even heard of or ate T.V. dinners. We always had someone to watch us, talk to, have help with homework, etc. I feel like I have so many values from having a SAHM. I really want my daughter to feel proud that her mother raised her, and didn't hand her over to a daycare lady.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your choice. Your children will be in school before you know it, you can always enter the workforce once they are in 1st grade! |`|7i6qj4OXaa	Be at home with your children.  The time spent with them when they are young is extremely precious and I was lucky enough to be able to stay at home with mine.  I know it is more difficult for people today but if you can afford to be with them, then you are truly blessed.  This time will never come again.|`|Cjc8YDQkaa	It is a hard decision.  In my opinion staying in your part time job and paying someone else to care for your kids during the day is the easier option because you know they are taken care of while you are at work and you have a bit to spend on the things you do like.  Unless of course if the cost of childcare takes most of your wages - then what are you working for.  To earn someone else's wages.  Then you are better off staying with your kids and while they are in school you can work and train toward re-entering the workforce when having quality paid childcare is no longer an issue.  Your time and money will then be 100% yours to choose how to spend and invest.  Whatever you decide, your children will benefit from.  If you choose to keep your job, they will benefit from the few extras you can afford because you are working and can pay for a few more material pleasures in life.  If you give up work you will be giving your kids your time.  A resource no amount of money can buy, and you can use it help your kids learn the kind of things you want them to learn, without relying on someone else to do it for you.<br>  <br>  I personally have chosen to be at home with my two.  I have a 9 year old boy and 3 year old girl.  Once the children are at school, you begin to share them with the world and you do find yourself wishing for the times when it was just you and them...so make the most of whatever time you can give them now, when it really matters.|`|LvywvZSeaa	I worked a great, well paying full time job that I loved when my oldest son was little. Now, I stay home with him (6) and our new baby (7 months). I wouldn't change it for the world. I am soooo happy, and I can't imagine how I worked all that time. I missed out on so much with my older son. It really is a personal preference, but if I were you, I would stay home. <br>  For me, I hate the thought of someone else watching my kids, just so I can bring in a little extra money. We live on a very tight budget...but it is worth it. I get to spend the days with my kids, and my house stays pretty clean, and I have time to cook. I never had any of that when i was working. The only thing that I miss about working, is the adult conversation. But I would take talking about dinosaurs and Harry Potter over gossip and news anyday!<br>  That is a choice only you can make...but if you do, you will be doing a great thing for your kids.<br>  Good luck and take care!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its a personal decision.  If you can afford it and you think that staying home with your children would be best, then do that.  If you want to continue to work for that extra money and so that the kids can understand that people have to work for a living, then do that.  Its really just up to you.  I suggest you sit down and speak with your husband.  Weigh out the pros and cons.  <br>  <br>  Since I never really enjoyed working (I'm not one of those people that felt like they HAD to be working or they'd go crazy), I jumped at the opportunity to stay home with my kids.  I just felt like being a SAHM was the most important and rewarding "job" I could be doing.  None of the other stuff mattered.  We live by a stricter budget, I've found new ways to get out and socialize with adults, I take my kids to play groups so that they get the experience of being around other people.....  That's strictly the way I felt though.  Everyone is different.|`|l1RTeYJgaa	Family first. Who knows what will happen with your job or anyones job, nothing is guaranteed, unless your an undertaker. Your kids will only grow up once. Yep by keeping the job you will be teaching your kids you need to work hard, but if you give it up you'll also be teaching them you need to make sacrifices in life, but also teach them that you can be happy even though you are on a budget.<br>  <br>  Yep money is good, but seeing a kid smile - priceless.|`|g0xJySzvaa	There really is no 'right' decision.<br>  <br>  I work with women who have decided to keep their full-time job, even though virtually all their salary goes towards private nurseries. But this way they maintain their career and have a life outside family (and have conversations with adults!). <br>  <br>  It might also be worth considering:<br>  What happens if your husband loses his job or he is no longer able to work? Would you be able to go out and get a good job easily? <br>  <br>  Are you comfortable depending on your husband for money? What if you want to splash out on some new clothes? Would you feel guilty, or would your husband be annoyed? <br>  <br>  I'm sure this isn't an easy decision!|`|67f702c23a5155f54675a8e89e6bdad8aa	I had a very well paying job and I decided to stay at home with the kids since my husband figured my job kinda had more of my attention.<br>  <br>  Well I did, and another baby came along, but i was more relaxed. I have a lot more time to spend on home work and that kind of thing.<br>  <br>  I also have a part time baby sitter so i would have some me time, and i also went to cooking classes, decorating classes and now I am in graduate school..sometimes you miss the corporate world...but then being home for me has been much more rewarding.|`|a7b6cafe9cae420516d8aa38158cf12faa	Reading your question ..I really don't think you want or need advice. I think you are just looking for approval to keep your  job.<br>  <br>  Hon , it's not wrong to want the best of both worlds and no one says  that if you don't stay home with your kids 24/7 that your not mother of the year material.<br>  <br>  If you can juggle both a career and motherhood then  do what makes you happy .|`|O0STSrsWaa	I would work part-time. I am a firm believer in children being socialized at daycare/preschool and it sounds like your kids are definitly old enough. Keep working and keep your independence...good for you.|`|5uxggLLmaa	That's a personal preference. I am pregnant with my first and hope to be able to stay home till mine are in elementary school. I am a teacher so will go back with them, which will help with the schedules and obviously I will not be giving up a big income to stay home. However, it will be a budget/lifestyle change. I will probably try to find some way to work from home and make some money. Your kids can learn that it is important to work in other ways, but I think you can teach your children so many other important values staying home with them. But.... you have to decide if you will also be happy staying at home too.

If you still haven't started in a week I would call your obgyn just to make sure that nothing else is going on with your body.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Well yes since a missed period is a sign of pregnancy. But also there are several reasons for a late/missed period such as Poor diet, Stress, Exercise, Lack of sleep, Hormones, Thyriod--hyper/hypo active, UTI, Medications, Obesity. So if I were you, I would go to the doctor & have them test you. They can do a blood test which will tell if your pregnant or not. If your not pregnant, they can run all other tests to narrow down whats going on.|`|DkvY8mOaaa	take another test - false negatives are common<br>  <br>  stress can also cause a period to be late - worrying about it can make it worse!<br>  <br>  x|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Go get a blood test ..<br>  <br>  Im 2 days late and I just got back from doing a blood test...I would get my result on monday hopefully Im..<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|yPcVeFokaa	   it is possible, but you can be late  due to stress,from personal experiences .it can be nothing to worry about ,it can just happen you may find one month you may be early.always though if in any doubt see your doctor or practise nurse.|`|7d5f5797c96cadc7bcfd406dce307c8baa	yes you could still be pregnant ,or if you have been worrying lately that can make you late,or another reason your late could be that you have got close to a new friend women tend to synchronise with eachothers cycles<br>  hope your happy which ever way it turns out x|`|xpVyMR2Qaa	id wait another week or may uve been stressed or something i was once the same and i was 3 weeks late but you could still be pregant so i would take another test did you leave how long it told are u feeling sick or anything and when u last had sex did he wear a condom just chill it should be ok |`|FlvxzFN6aa	Yes, still absolutely possible - a missed period is a pretty sure sign that you are pregnant afterall.

vjsT8DMIaa	oh the joys of latter pregnancy!! LOL I have been experiencing the same thing....It just comes and goes. My doctor told me its because of the baby putting pressure on the vena cava...especially if it happens when you're laying down. Well at least its almost over, and you didnt have morning sickness at the begining of your pregnancy!!|`|AA11820380	Yes. I got sick about 4 times throughout my whole pregnancy with my first, that was wonderful compared to this one. With this one I have hyperememsis and it is very horrible. You are one of the lucky ones to not have it until now. Hopefully it won't last and will go away. Try chewing on gum when you get nauseas. That helps me alot.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	yeah i did, and it was not fun. i could be sitting there and all of a sudden id feel sick. it is crappy but soon you will have the baby and it will all be over|`|wjdckI2maa	Don't worry hon it's normal.|`|7d5f5797c96cadc7bcfd406dce307c8baa	its a girl !!!!!!!

If it shows neg, then try again in a week or two if no period. Or you could just go to the doctor. They'll be able to tell for sure by blood test.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	You could be. Those symptoms might not be from pregnancy as it is way too early. You wouldnt be eating more unless your period is coming, your body stores fat during that week. If your pregnant, your appitite wont increase until you are about 3 months. You wouldnt be having the urge to pee more frequently this early if you were pregnant. That usually comes at around 7+ weeks due to the uterus pressure on the bladder. If you were pregnant now, your uterus wouldnt have changed much yet & your baby would be the size of a grape seed. So no pressure yet. Dizziness & Fatigue can be either a sign of pregnancy or pms. I believe fatigue is one of the first signs of pregnancy. Heres how my symptoms came in order<br>  <br>  Sore/Swollen Breasts 1 week before expected period<br>  Strong sense of smell 1 week before expected period<br>  Missed period & positive pregnancy test<br>  Period like cramps & Acne 1 week after missed period <br>  Nausea 3 weeks after missed period<br>  Extreme fatigue 3 weeks after missed period|`|9GvflDg1aa	Yes, it sounds like you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  The discharge sounds like implantation bleeding.<br>  <br>  But take a pregnancy test!<br>  <br>  ***|`|3yd8bEKSaa	Only a test can tell its possible if ur 3 days late |`|Tzv4dQcJaa	kinda sounds like it but you might not be.<br>  go to the doctors.

stCyrS4Eaa	Some bottled water is not  filtered any more than tap water. Some are much more reputable. It would be perfectly fine to use a good bottled water. Some bottled water is even better than many of the areas I have lived in, as far as tap water.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	Yes -that will be fine.|`|6710b87650d29aedb9ee3b4272d6af96aa	Yes you can.|`|86937fc841745442b830b05831de5dadaa	Of course it's fine as long as you chose a water which isn't too loaded in magnesium. Evian is fine and dandy for babies.<br>  <br>  We live in Scotland where the tap water couldn't be purer. But I was in France for Christmas and didn't know tap water ( even boiled) there wasn't safe for babies. My 10 month old son got some bad stomach aches after 2 days so I switched to Evian. A lot of countries such as France or Italy only use mineral water for babies.|`|1coVkX3qaa	you can but I would advise you boil it first as even though its botteled it isnt garented not to have bacteria in it that could cause a baby to become unwell<br>  good luck|`|wUfZJvbUaa	bottled water... that's the only thing i use to make formula... i'm sure it's fine.|`|axRzwaQ8aa	Oh NO!!you mustn't use anything other than breastmilk until your baby is 33 years old!!!<br>  they should hsave told you this at the hospital!!<br>  <br>  oh,wait ...... uh<br>  i used tap water,unboiled for making my son's formula from his first week<br>  bottled water is perfectly fine<br>  but try a "sensitvie for fussy and gassy babies" as most regular formulas are way too harsh on babies digestive tract|`|7e4f3a720b78a9ee4fba84fdc6e474c9aa	I would rather use bottled water over tap water. Unless you have some filtration system on your tap, I don't like using it. So its fine.|`|QJ17P0DOaa	just make sure its sodium content is not high the feeding  book i have [ireland] recommends evavin bottled water|`|rUk14E7iaa	it's accually better than tap water.|`|0ff947cccf3db475aceed2f510747b80aa	Yes, low sodium.
DgXmTJzYaa	I would guess implantation cramps!! Good luck! I hope this is my month too I will keep my fingures crossed for both of us!!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I'd say the cramps you are getting are either implantation or leading up to an implantation!  Lets hope for a positive GIRL! xxx|`|PKHZNS1Paa	i got cramps a few days after ovulation. Its totally normal, and could be a good sign because i ended up pregnant that cycle!|`|d54784ffbf5354267478c5b7043eaf8eaa	Implantation occurs about a week after conception. Since you are only two or three days past 'possible' conception those cramps are most likely not implantation cramps. <br>  <br>  I experience cramping before, during and for a few days after ovulation. My OB says it's common to have ovulation cramping for a few days after. I am guessing that's what you are experiencing. Good luck!|`|AA11815208	If it said you were ovulating and you did it then everything is fine. Its probably just cramping from implantation. The nipple thing makes no sense though. You normally dont have any of that yet.
Yl3C9svGaa	I had NO symptoms with my first pregnancy.  Test if you feel it is necessary.|`|d54784ffbf5354267478c5b7043eaf8eaa	Pregnancy symptoms that you usually associate with pregnancy don't really kick in until several weeks in. So don't expect to feel much at the very beginning. Test if you want, but just be prepared to see a negative result. You are so early that you may be pregnant but do not produce enough pregnancy hormones for the test to pick up. <br>  <br>  If you want to know for sure, wait until the day you expect your next period to start.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	you should probably wait til the day your period is due.  if you don't get your period then you have a higher chance of not getting a false negative.  it's very difficult to judge if a woman is pregnant or not based on symptoms because every woman and every pregnancy is different.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I'd wait till the day of your missed period to test personally, but you can if you want.  You may get false readings.  (As in a negative rather than a positive when you may be pregnant.)  Some women never have any pregnancy symptoms through their pregnancy, except for growing pains and a belly. :)  So, don't worry! xxx|`|MtC3CWZraa	Wait at least until the day your period is due to raise your chances of an accurate result.
XyTRuk2Paa	oh I know this one... only where I am you have to wait 3 days for test results... Just had to play the waiting game last month it sucks so bad!! I had my blood drawn on thursday and had to wait until tuesday for the results! Hang in there the wait is hard I know but just try and pass the time as best as you can  you could also do what I did... bought a whole bunch of hpt's and peed on 2 a day.. it was a waste of money but helped to keep my mind at peace|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I don't know how soon they may take, but normally the thyroid tests results can take from 2-3 days to get back.  I have hypothyroidism and that's how long my test results take, but for the blood test with pregnancy that can come back in a few hours!  Let me know if you get a positive or not!  :)  I need to go pick my hubby up from work and will not be able to get a message till later!  Take care and hope you get a positive!!! xxx|`|2tCbCvzXaa	its not monday, take a chill pill. if you are congrats|`|PAxKLJnEaa	How irritating! Lol I think they know me so well (and the lab is in the clinic) that they know to get it back to me quickly or they'll be hearing from me. I hope this is it! But if it isn't, then yay lets be excited for this next month! With the help, and getting clear results from the SA will for sure give you more answers. So regardless, all you can go is up from here right? :)|`|M5MJ0HbKaa	Aw I feel for you! I hope you are and lots of baby dust to you!!!|`|d54784ffbf5354267478c5b7043eaf8eaa	I am assuming you are very early on, which is why you can't go take a home pregnancy test. If that's the case and you have to wait until Monday to find out... here's my suggestion. <br>  <br>  Pick one special treat for yourself for the next few days to help pass the time in a more enjoyable manner! So, for tonight go to Blockbuster and rent a movie. Make some popcorn and have a soda. Clean up your living room, and then lay on the couch with your feet up. Have a movie night!<br>  <br>  Then tomorrow find something fun to do or go out to eat somewhere special. <br>  <br>  Sunday get your nails done and go get some ice cream. <br>  <br>  Then by Monday you will know the results! Good luck and enjoy the next few days. Monday will be here before you know it!
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	You pee in a cup. They take the urine, and stick a strip into it. The test that they use will show if youre pregnant or not. They can also take blood to test the HCG in your blood. The blood test is a lot more accurate.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	why dont you just buy 1 at the shop the day your period is due<br>  <br>  and normally they will give you a little bottle thing and ask you to go to the bathroom and fill it, you give it back to them and they put a pregnancy test in to see if its positive or negative, but trust me its better to do one your self, you can get them for less than ￡3|`|uJU7jGtHaa	just buy one, they are avalible in alot of places and start from like 1 pound. if you are just going to wait for the doctor to do the test u just take a urine sample n they do a test, same as if you bought one x|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well once you give your urine sample they'll see if it's positive and if it is then they'll probably schedule you a u/s to determine due date or may just schedule your first prenatal appointment. They won't do anything but find out if you're pregnant or not. They may request a blood test to be done too~|`|uVuYdcRcaa	They give you a little bottle, you go and pee in it, they stick a test in it and if postitive you pregnant, if negative then you not pregnant.<br>  <br>  But if I were you I would just test myself using a home pregnancy test! Clearblue digital is great!<br>  <br>   Lx
Q7lvSU03aa	When my baby was that old she would spit up.  And I mean everything.  She would literally soak me or whoever was holding her.  She would do this 1-3 times a day.  I of course freaked.  I talked to my pediatrician and she said don't worry unless it is like 6-8 times a day.  <br>  <br>  It continued for about a month and a half.  Then she just stopped.  I tried all the tricks, nothing worked.  It is scary but unless it is all the time and over an extended period of time, there is not much doctors can do about it.|`|nmu6coapaa	It's normal for babies to spit up but if you think it's a lot then it may be acid reflux!|`|sAhAEC2qaa	they make enfamil AR for babies who spit up frequently. but you can also add rice cereal to her formula.|`|8LP57QOCaa	she may have reflux, i suggest going to your doctor or health nurse and having her checke dout, also try breaking her feed in half for instance give her a little bit then wait another half an hour and offer again if she throws up after that then it may be reflux, but try breaking her fee up and see if that helps she may be getting too much for her tummy to handle and breaking it in half could solve that, if that doesn't help go to your doctor and get her checked for reflux.|`|be8b9be707d55fa32115a4088d3ac4c3aa	My son is 7 weeks old now and he was spitting up a lot at every feeding. He was born 4 1/2 weeks early. When I told the doctor about this he said he has acid reflux and I needed to add rice cereal to his bottles. I started this and we have had no more spitting up. He said he could give him zantac too if I wanted it. He said to make sure that you keep the baby upright for at least 30min after every feeding. You may need to elevate the crib too. This is everything that they told me 3weeks ago and we are much better. It really helps a lot. Good luck to you. I hope this helps.|`|kjcybCOvaa	maybe you should burp the baby then she will spit up its normal.|`|DzlOVHkzaa	Make sure you are feeding the baby the milk/formula at body temperature.  If the milk/formula is cold or only room temperature the baby is more likely to spit it back at you.<br>  <br>  Feed the baby 1/2 an ounce at a time - then burp at each interval.<br>  <br>  Try exclusively feeding your daughter your breast milk for a couple of feedings.  My preemie would spit up formula fortified breast milk by the bottle full but only spit up a small amount with the straight breast milk.  With pre-term babies there is a possibility thier digestive systems are not quite capable of handling the formula.  You may need to get a Hypo-allergenic formula until her stomache matures. Consult with your doctor before switching the formula.|`|zHy0z7sAaa	Some spit up is normal.But it is possible that your baby has acid reflux.Call her doctor.

Tc23KWgzaa	Your child is obviously more interested in what he's doing than what you are doing.  That's okay.  You just keep it up.  He may not look like he's watching, but he is.<br>  <br>  Have you been reading to him?  You may have to start with some of the books that have noises with them, or textures to feel.  Find a book about the toy he most loves, like trucks, or bears, or dogs.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|JsqMSU9Haa	it's rare at that age for babies to let you read them a book.  just keep showing him the baby board books, a picture or two at a time - another few months he should be able to sit through a book.  make sure they are books your child can relate to - animals, everyday objects.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	I have a 10 month old who loves reading.  For a slightly older baby I would suggest gimmicky books.  My daughter loves textured books you feel, books with flaps, board books and scratch and sniff books.  She also likes books that make noises or light up.<br>  <br>  There are several books that talk about how to read books to babies, what to read, and the importance of reading.  I invested in one for myself, but they are also available at your local library.  I have linked to the Read Aloud Handbook.  <br>  <br>  The value of reading is priceless - and prepares them for school big time!   Good luck!|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	15 months is not the same as 15 years - take it easy on him :) he likes listening to your voice as it's soothing for him and he could care less about the story.. but do continue with the reading, he will get into it eventually.. on the other hand, my child likes to spend some time with a good book in a crib.. tearing it :).. babies are babies - let them discover on their own.. he will come around to reading :)|`|MkchPOjFaa	honostly babies that age dont have any interest in book...my niece started liking book at 2 in a half and now shes 3 and now she acts like shes reading her books all the time..just let him play for now hell start showing interest ina few more months|`|VquZAwfHaa	Do the books you choose have lots of big colorful pictures? Do you let your baby touch the pages and "interact" with the book if s/he wants to?|`|IoR4JY3paa	My wife and I have read to our 6 year old since she was a baby. We now have a 17 month old and we read to her every night as well. The trick is consistency! Stay with the reading and eventually he or she will be very interested! Remember you are introducing something that he/she will nee all the way through life! Reading to your child is a positive and great togetherness that you both will end up enjoying! It is never to late dear! Just don't stop!|`|iflGyxsgaa	well most babies dont listen some babies do. my niece and my cousin which were babies not that long were also not interested in reading i would read to them when i could and they werent interested.  i think that you should wait when its a little bit older because i read to them and they and seem interested and they go to find a book and they try to read it|`|skurMIyYaa	Try sitting him him down in a calm settled quiet area without toys and when you read the book make sure to raise your voice and use lots of emotion.

SaRDq9iLaa	OMG my 6 month old daughter does the same thing when that commercial comes on!   As soon as she hears the guitar she stares at the television until the commercial is over.  It doesn't matter if she is eating, playing or even crying.  If she has to, she will even turn her head really far around (kind of like an owl) to look at the tv.  Actually today she had fallen asleep when my mother-in-law was holding her, she heard the comical and woke up.  As soon as the commercial was over she closed her eyes again and went back to sleep.  My husband and I think it is so funny that we video taped it!|`|yCwPxulYaa	My daughter will be playing in her walker and not paying attention to the tv at all, but if something on the tv catches her attention, she will drop everything she is doing and stare at the tv in a daze, and then go back to doing whatever she was doing.  It is funny!|`|XXbFFVg8aa	My daughter LOVES watching TV. Actually, its embarrasing because its bad for babies, but my husband always watches movies with her when I work, and he plays video games with her in his lap. Whenever we go to a restaurant and there is a TV, she will ZONE IN! Babies are such amazing little humans that teach us just as much as we teach them!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter has always had a fascination with a car insurance commercial (The General) and any lawyer commercials.
AA11689956	Pyrothea...not much a fan but when i think of it i think of the girl in firestarter lol|`|AA11148143	Strikes me as sounding like either a disease of the gums or a plant used to make hedges, or maybe even an insecticide.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It is horrible. Seriously.|`|6x2fLyvMaa	Pyrothea sounds like a name for a health problem :) lol sorry i don't mean to be mean...<br>  <br>  I agree with the other people - Pyra sounds really pretty yet unique and special.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Unique but I think it would be cuter if you just named her Pyra.|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Pyra is nice. leave it as Pyra<br>  not pfhysdjtheaja|`|J4NgqZSIaa	i like pyra better|`|jpENdop3aa	It reminds me of a name like what they would use for a woman cartoon character or something.. Like the old cartoon with the Heman guy in it.<br>  Also looks too much like Python. That is the first word that came to mind when I read it.<br>  One more thing, the meaning "fire goddess" makes me think of the devil's wife or something along that line.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, just being honest.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	i don't like the name because:<br>  <br>  a.) it sounds like a disease<br>  b.) you don't want kids thinking she likes setting things on fire.<br>  c.) roll call on the first day of school may be embarrassing<br>  <br>  as much as the meaning is nice, not everyone is going to know that. stick with pyra.|`|A0FjxXyDaa	naming your kid a pyro before they're born might not be the best idea. it's too ancient sounding. what about madea? now that's a powerful name. maddy.....come on hehe|`|dTPg4uYzaa	i agree Pyra would be better Pyrothea seems to hard to pronounce|`|MKwywGBaaa	It sounds like she is going to have some serious issues growing up.|`|x6easjsvaa	Nice try, but it's not good.  You'd be better off just naming her Pyra.|`|ibg67Xtvaa	i think you should just go with pyra|`|7TXNlZL9aa	I think it would be cute being Prya, but you being from greek and the meaning that it has it's nice. Don't name your child what you want because of what other people think though. A guy sent his answer to me and said my baby shouldn't have two middle names but not alot of people do that's why I want her to have two middle names and that's what I'm sticking with.|`|RLUpDeKOaa	How about Apollonia, the female version of Apollo Greek god of the sun? Or Hestia, greek goddess of Hearth and Home. You might do a play on Hephaestus, Greek God of Fire also.|`|AKAAi31uaa	Pyrothea is to complicated.

Am54a7c0aa	I really, really don't like the name Hayden as a girls name.<br>  <br>  However, it's not too bad other than that.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I like it.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Hayden is a masculine boy's name and horrid for a little girl. Marie although filler is nice since it honors family.<br>  <br>  Caitlin Marie would be far better and feminine.|`|a4i45Yumaa	Maybe just Hayden Marie...or Caitlin Marie...I named my daughter Makya (Ma-ky-uh) Marie because Marie is my middle name.  Some would say Marie is too original but I think it is feminine like you said.  And it balances out a unique name.  Hayden Marie Caitlin is kind of long but they are all cute names! =)|`|aYVVwjBXaa	personally i think Hayden is a boys name.<br>  <br>  Marie is a cliched "go-to" middle name, and is so common thats it appears somewhere in EVERYBODY'S family. very very unoriginal.<br>  <br>  Caitlin is okay but also trendy and boring.|`|ibg67Xtvaa	leave out marie and reverse the order to caitlin hayden
oRaYQNXxaa	Bless your heart you sound scared by the way this question looks. LOL. <br>  So she is a week late? <br>  She needs to get a pregnancy test and take it. Thats all I can tell ya buddy. <br>  Good luck!|`|TRrTunqvaa	you go to a doctor.. even tests lie sometimes|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Get her to take a test|`|3ejndAQlaa	we found out after my wife missed her period and than started to have nausea. pregnancy test is the best way to find out only is she has been over 3 weeks late.|`|NfvMIjJvaa	There could be. The only way To be sure is a pregnancy test. When I got pregnant I knew cause there was a feeling. but everyone is different.|`|7jXChfBNaa	the only way to tell is by a pregnancy test.|`|zVN2ZDY4aa	Well there ae A lot of reasons why she could be late eg,stress not eating right irregular cycle. so yer there is a chance sh isn't altough best to have a pregnancy test done to be sure or go see a doctor
AA10526033	no go to the dr. you would have no reason to be out of breath unless the baby was big enough it was pressing on your lungs and hopefully you would know if you were preggo by then. if you have had your period and all negative tests you arent pregnant and next time use protection you seem young,|`|A1yiWncPaa	yes....google up symtoms of early pregnancy, u should find some helpful web-sites. also u might be 2early on 2tell with a home test, either wait a week after a missed period or go 2planned parent hood for a blood test and to get checked2....our body's are still changing so u never kno but go get checked girl!!!! good- luck
Uy8ntukjaa	Implantation bleeding only occurs in about 20% of pregnancies but it should take place between 6-12 days after you ovulate, most commonly on day 9. Your period should come 12-16 days after ovulation. 18 days late means you are likely pregnant. It is not uncommon to have light spotting or brown bleeding during pregnancy. Take a test, do not wait any longer, if you are pregnant there is enough hcg to detect it by now. Some women do not experience early pregnancy symptoms. Also being tired IS an obvious pregnancy symptom!
hCTTkwaZaa	my doctor decided to have me induced about 15 min after striped my membranes <br>  i think she wanted to see me in pain lol
rpZRlJMzaa	yes im 1 cm dialated and no plug!<br>  some people say they never see their plug!<br>  <br>  =]]|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes. I was a centimeter and hadn't lost mine.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Yep. I'm 2 Centimeters dilated and 50% effaced and i haven't lost mine yet.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yeah i was 2cm for 2wks b4 my water broke and no plug...plug came out couple hrs b4 i gave birth basically while i was in active labor
AA12384954	Well if she hasn't had sex it doesn't sound like too big a problem.  As she is very young you could advise that many young girls are irregular when they first get their periods.  As she has moved from another country there is a possibility that stress has caused her periods to become irregular too, and that would probably settle down as she becomes more relaxed.  I understand you not wanting to see a doctor, but I would suggest asking for a female doctor as your sister would probably feel a lot more comfortable speaking with a lady.  Good luck.|`|E84iCYH2aa	Sure she didnt have sex? If she didnt then also missing periods is quite normal due to hormonal imbalances sometimes. But yes it occurs sometime due to polycystic ovarian conditions which in future might hamper her ability to conceive.<br>  <br>  I dont think its a right idea to neglect and sit back at home.Watch out the pattern for a couple of months more time. If she continues to face extremely irregular periods with less flow and bad cramps do take her to the doctor and get her checked.|`|XSXdMu0caa	it could be stress<br>  that does sometimes stop a period <br>  you could wait and see if she gets her next one if she doesnt then take her to the doctor, but i dont know if it could be a symptom of anything else id say stress but im not a doctor<br>  are there other symptoms ais she stressed?|`|KQy7b8ooaa	Is she taking any hormone disturbing medicine? Has anything about her physics changed?|`|vY0ScgeXaa	many things could cause irregular period.<br>  <br>  not just pregnancy.<br>  <br>  go to a doc to check out.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Stress will delay it for a few days.
3PRMvQbiaa	your either pregnant or late because of stress.  I would take another test, your not likely to even get a faint positive if your not prego.  With my first I had 1 positive and then took another one because I couldn't believe it (trying so long) the nest 3 test said no then the 5th test (different brand) said yes.  The key is allow at least 5 hours between testing and the best is to test first thing in the morning!<br>  Good Luck!|`|JxVx0GXiaa	False positives are rare & the fact is you have 4 tests showing positives. Congrats mama!!!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Yes take another test. It is very rare to get false positives, let alone get 3 like you did. Good luck..|`|oCTG5IVvaa	A positive is a positive! especially that many lol congratulations! I don't think you need to do another one, but i'm sure you will anyway, i got addicted to seeing that positive line! x x x|`|AA11661793	wait a few days and do it first thing in the morning with your first urine. Sounds like you are pregnant with 4 positives, but to be sure test again! Good luck!|`|VEEbzc4jaa	do another test in a week, your HCG levels arent obviously high enough|`|ibg67Xtvaa	Yes definitely good luck and keep trying|`|tBzDmfg8aa	Hi, <br>  I think so too that ur HSG levels aren't high enough to show but to be sure, wait a week more then see a doc...he'll do u a urine test and u will find out for sure whether u are. At the moment it looks like u are. Just relax. TC.|`|LoBKzXNTaa	Wait a few more days then take another one.

ibg67Xtvaa	of course you can have sex when you're pregnant<br>  Is it safe to have sex while I'm pregnant?<br>  Most women who are having a normal pregnancy may continue to have sex right up until their water breaks or they go into labor. You won't hurt the baby by making love. The amniotic sac and the strong muscles of the uterus protect your baby, and the thick mucus plug that seals the cervix helps guard against infection.<br>  <br>  There are some circumstances, though, in which you may need to modify your activity or abstain from sex altogether for part or all of your pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor should let you know whether you have — or develop — any complications that make sex a no-go. If you're uncertain, ask your caregiver.<br>  <br>  Will sex feel different now that I'm pregnant?<br>  Many women report that sex feels different during pregnancy. Some find it more pleasurable, at least at times. Others may generally find it less so, for part or all of the pregnancy. Here's what's going on.<br>  <br>  Increased blood flow to the pelvic area can cause engorgement of the genitals. The heightened sensation that results may add to your pleasure during sex. You may have more vaginal discharge or moistness, which could also be a plus.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you may not like how these changes feel and may find that genital engorgement gives you an uncomfortable feeling of fullness. You may also have abdominal cramps during or immediately after intercourse.<br>  <br>  Your breasts may feel tingly, tender, and unusually sensitive to touch, particularly in the first trimester. The tenderness generally subsides, but your breasts may remain more sensitive. Some women will find this heightened sensitivity to be a turn-on, while others won't (and may even prefer that their breasts not be touched at all).<br>  <br>  Let your partner know if anything feels uncomfortable, even if it's something you're used to doing all the time. If you find you're feeling turned on but not enjoying intercourse, consider other erotic activities, such as mutual pleasuring, oral sex, or self-stimulation. Experiment and make adjustments as a couple to make sex relaxing and pleasurable for both of you.<br>  <br>  Remember, too, that there's more to physical intimacy than sex. If you don't feel like having sex or your caregiver has advised you not to, you can still hug, kiss, and caress each other.<br>  <br>  I haven't really been in the mood since I got pregnant. Is this normal?<br>  There's a wide range of individual experiences when it comes to sexual desire during pregnancy. Some women have a heightened libido throughout pregnancy, while others find they're less interested in sex. Many women find that their sexual appetite fluctuates, perhaps depending on how they're otherwise feeling physically and emotionally.<br>  <br>  You may feel too tired, moody, or nauseated to make love, especially in the first trimester. It's not unusual to feel overwhelmed by the physical and emotional changes you're going through. But take heart — you may find that your libido returns in the second trimester after morning sickness and fatigue have abated.<br>  <br>  It's also not uncommon, however, for desire to wane again in the third trimester, particularly in the last month or two. At this point, you may be too big, achy, or exhausted to make love comfortably. You may feel self-conscious about how your body has changed or preoccupied with the approach of labor and birth.<br>  <br>  Let your partner know how you feel and reassure him that you still love him. It's crucial to keep the lines of communication open and to support each other as best you can as you go through these changes together.<br>  <br>  Will my partner's sex drive change?<br>  Most partners find their pregnant lover as attractive as ever or even more so, though not all do. But there are all kinds of reasons your partner's desire may be dampened at least part of the time during your pregnancy. For example, he may be apprehensive about the burdens of parenthood, and that anxiety may affect his sexual desire.<br>  <br>  Probably the most common reason that men become more tentative about sex during pregnancy is a fear that sex could hurt the baby. If your partner needs reassurance about the safety of sex during pregnancy, bring him with you to your next prenatal appointment.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, talk to each other about your fears and anxieties, as well as your needs and desires. Open communication can defuse a lot of tension and allow you to relax, enjoy each other, and find ways to be intimate, whether or not you're having intercourse.<br>  <br>  Is it safe for my partner to give me oral sex?<br>  For the most part, yes. Licking is fine, but your partner shouldn't blow into your genital area. Forcing or blowing air into the vagina could cause an air embolism (a bubble of air that gets into your blood circulation). This happens very rarely, but it could be life threatening for you or the baby.<br>  <br>  It's also not safe for your partner to give you oral sex during pregnancy if he has an active outbreak of oral herpes or feels|`|shdbze26aa	it's not only weird but also dangerous for the pregnant woman.|`|WVPRUzLuaa	it is fine to have sex when pregnant un less you have had problems with the pregnantce like bleeding or other problems it is good to have sex and also when you due to have the baby have sex your midwife will tell you that when the time comes i have had one boy and identical twins and i had sex the whole way through but if your still unsure see your doctor

ibg67Xtvaa	Every woman's labor is unique. But understanding the typical signs of labor can help you know what to expect as your due date approaches. <br>  On television, babies are often born with a rush of emotion and swift action. The mother doubles over from the pain of a single contraction, and the baby appears before the commercial break.<br>  <br>  In reality, labor usually begins less dramatically.<br>  <br>  No one knows for sure what triggers labor — and every woman's experience is unique. But understanding the typical signs of labor can help you know what to expect as your due date approaches.<br>  <br>  Lightening: Adjusting the pressure<br>  One of the first signs of labor may be a sensation that the baby is settling deeper into your pelvis. This is known as lightening.<br>  <br>  The baby's new position may give your lungs more room to expand, making it easier to breathe. On the flip side, you may experience pelvic discomfort, and increased pressure on your bladder may send you to the bathroom more often.<br>  <br>  For a first pregnancy, lightening may occur weeks or days before labor begins. For subsequent pregnancies, it may not happen ahead of time. For some women, the changes are obvious. Others may not notice a thing.<br>  <br>  Effacement: Ripening of the cervix<br>  Your cervix prepares for birth by softening and thinning, or effacing. You won't feel this sign of labor happening. Instead, your health care provider will check for signs of cervical change with vaginal exams.<br>  <br>  Effacement is often expressed in percentages. When you're 50 percent effaced, your cervix is half its original thickness. Your cervix must be 100 percent effaced, or completely thinned out, before a vaginal delivery.<br>  <br>  Dilation: Opening of the cervix<br>  Your cervix will also begin to open, or dilate. Your health care provider will measure the dilation in centimeters from zero to 10.<br>  <br>  At first, these cervical changes may be very slow. In fact, some women are dilated 2 to 3 centimeters for days or even weeks before labor actually begins. Your progress isn't a good indicator of when labor will begin, but rather a general sign that you're getting ready for labor. Once you're in active labor, expect to dilate more quickly.<br>  <br>  Bloody show: Loss of mucous plug<br>  During pregnancy, a thick plug of mucus blocks the cervical opening to prevent bacteria from entering the uterus. When your cervix begins to thin and open, this plug may be discharged. You may notice stringy mucus or a thick discharge. It's typically brown and sometimes tinged with blood. <br>  <br>  Losing the mucous plug is among the telltale signs of labor, but it's not a guarantee. Labor may still be a week or more away. <br>  <br>  Nesting: Spurt of energy<br>  You might wake up one morning feeling energetic, raring to attack dust bunnies under the couch, set up the crib and arrange your baby's outfits according to color. This urge to clean and organize is commonly known as nesting. No one knows for sure, but it may be a primal instinct that hearkens back to a time when physical preparation was necessary for a safer childbirth.<br>  <br>  Nesting may begin months before your due date, but the instinct is usually strongest just before delivery. Do what you must, but don't wear yourself out. Save your energy for the harder work of labor ahead.<br>  <br>  Rupture of membranes: Your water breaks<br>  The amniotic sac is a fluid-filled membrane that cushions your baby in the uterus. Sometimes the sac leaks or breaks before labor begins. If this happens, you may notice a trickle of fluid or a more obvious gush.<br>  <br>  If your water breaks at home — or if you're uncertain whether the fluid is amniotic fluid, urine or something else — consult your health care provider right away. He or she will evaluate you and your baby to determine the next steps.<br>  <br>  If the amniotic sac is no longer intact, timing becomes important. The longer the membranes are ruptured, the greater the risk of developing an infection. If labor doesn't begin on its own, your health care provider may need to induce your labor.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, don't do anything that could introduce bacteria into your vagina. Sex isn't a good idea if you think you might be leaking amniotic fluid.<br>  <br>  Contractions: When labor pains begin<br>  During the last few months of pregnancy, you may experience occasional, painless contractions — a sensation that your uterus is tightening and relaxing. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions. They're your body's way of warming up for labor.<br>  <br>  As your due date approaches, Braxton Hicks contractions may become stronger or even painful. Eventually, Braxton Hicks contractions will be replaced by the real thing. To tell the difference, ask yourself these questions:<br>  <br>  Are the contractions regular? Time your contractions from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next. Look for a regular pattern of contractions that get stronger and closer together. Contractions that come at least every five minutes are likely to be the real thing. The contractions of false labor will remain irregular.|`|eWEqGHvJaa	While every woman's labor is different there are a few things that are always the same.  Usually there are contractions in both the back and stomach.  In true labor the contractions will be regular and will be getting closer as the labor progresses.  I have seen ladies that only had a few hours of labor and then then there are those that have contractions for two days.  If you are having discharge I would get the doctor to check me.  That would be the safest way to know if you are near labor.
723QHuicaa	I always gave formula as my daughter wanted it. Sometimes when they feel off, their appetite decreases. In a solid food baby, if this happened, I would just offer formula and finger food. <br>  <br>  She could try feeding him in the bathroon with the shower on, the steam may clear the congestion while he eats.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Of course she does. How is starving him going to help?<br>  <br>  At this age, his solids are for practice and taste only. He's not getting any nutrients from them - or not enough to live on.|`|5ZvALiclaa	yes, he needs as much nutrition and more importantly, as much fluids as he will take<br>  <br>  Formula milk won't do anything bad to him other than get him well sooner.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.commoncold.org/special1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoncold.org/special1.htm</a><br>   Myth 5:<br>   Drinking milk causes increased nasal mucus during a cold.<br>   <br>  Facts:<br>   1. Milk and mucus may look alike, but milk is digested like any other protein and is not specifically converted into nasal mucus.<br>  <br>  2. An Australian study was actually done in volunteers to address this question. (77) It showed that people drinking lots of milk had no more nasal mucus than those not drinking milk.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes, and contrary to popular belief it doesn't make things worse- my son was sick with a  fever and a cold and his doctor said if he wants milk give it to him, because it's still fluid- not to give milk when sick is a myth.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Milk doesn't cause phlegm, that's just a myth hun.

It has a thinner consistency than the milk that we drink.  And YES I know what you mean... I love milk, but can't drink it when I have a cold. <br>  <br>  That's just my personal opinion, as you know you should always consult a pediatrician before making any decision about the baby's health if you are not sure.|`|WVPRUzLuaa	yes and in between the formula bottles give him some water to keep his fluid up u can also see if his a little bit dehydrated just feel his soft spot and if it is quite sunken in that means he is a bit dehydrated don't stress just give him a bit of water if he has trouble breathing through his nose whilst drinking there is a nasal spray that is ok for baby's called fess nasal spray it is fantastic i have twins that are 8 mths old they always have cold because my son 2yrs goes to child care and catches it there|`|h85kkDsbaa	Yes just continue feeding as normal especially formula as the baby gets everything he needs from milk. If he has a blocked nose try using a suction to clear the nose or some vapor rub.<br>  <br>  If you dont feed him he will be sick and hungry.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Yes continue to give formula...with a cold the baby needs as much liquid as you can get in him because babies dehydrate before we know it.
723QHuicaa	I buy and sell on ebay. I, personally, wouldnt buy a bundle of clothes. So if I were you, Id list them individually, I also think you would get more money for them. People might be wary as I might like the stuff at the top of the pile, that I can see, but not the rest, or vice versa.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** If your going to bundle, Id only group them in 2 or 3, and Id make the items as similar out fits - ie, 3 sets of dungaree's, 3 2 piece khaki sets, etc. And all the same size.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** To save time, you can use one listing as a template, and all you need to do is change the pic and description. This is how I list -<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=270345186082" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?V...</a><br>  <br>  You see all the blurb at the bottom - I use a template with that on it so I dont need to type it all the time. Id also recommend you list say 20 items per weeks. List a lot will give you a lot of stuff to wrap and leave room for error. Some stuff may have to be listed 2-3 times before it sells. Plus, you need a verified Paypal account, which will have monthly withdrawal limits - so listing loads of stuff and earning over that limit, you wont be able to transfer all the money from paypal to your bank account.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** Also, mention you are selling other similar stuff and can combine postage, if the person mentions this and im buying, i will usually look at their other stuff and bid on it too.|`|um29wkUPaa	Depends what they want for S&H.  Here's what I do.  I review what's posted then I decide what I'd pay for each item (not outfit).  Say I come up with $2 per item (depending on new/used and to what degree).  I also factor OUT the S&H that is being requested.  I have a real problem paying for S&H, that's just me.  Then I multiply my new number by how many items are included in your Lot, and I put it in.  I always enter my highest bid.  It defaults to the lowest necessary to be top bidder, but it saves me from having to keep checking and racing the clock against some cheapskate.  I hate a pizzing contest.<br>  <br>  So if there is a 30 piece lot on ebay, but they want $12 for S&H, I may be willing to pay $2.00 for each item (which is now $60 subtotal) but I take off the $12 because I won't pay S&H so now my max bid is $48.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	if you have a special, expensive outfit, sell it separately - depends on the outfit of course, but you can start it at $7.99<br>  if you have a bunch of name brand outfits or pieces, sell them in a lot, maybe $3.99 per outfit<br>  then i'd sell the rest in a lot by themselves - figure .10 - .25 per piece of clothing<br>  <br>  ebays good because the 'market' will determine the price|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I packed my babies old clothes up, into garbage bags, and let my friends know I had these sizes, and this many bags.<br>  <br>  A lady paid 50$ a bag for my babies clothes.|`|AA11997524	Sell them as "lots" on craigslist.  0-3 and so on.  My friends are ppl that do buy "lots" of clothing.  You can take them to a consignment place also, but I think craigslist is your best bet.  I'd average about 25 cents per shirt, and 50 cents for pants, then bibs and all the tiny about 10 cents.  Do this just to get an average, and go from there.<br>  <br>  I buy/sell from craiglist a lot. I think breaking up the lots in that way would be best, and cut a deal from the total about 10-20 bucks off for ppl that will take it all.  It will sell, trust me.<br>  <br>  I'd do a photobucket or something so they can see it, not each piece that's ridiculous, I do not recommend ebay for huge lots like this, individually on ebay would just take way too long.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I would offer them in size lots as you'll find them easier to ship in smaller groups and you'll probably generate more interest as I find many "shoppers" on-line tend to be looking for a specific size.  <br>  <br>  When I'm buying used children's clothing (which I do a lot), I hardly ever pay more than $1 per item.  If the lot has 40 items and I like most of them, I wouldn't pay more than about $40-$45 dollars (shipping cost included). Anything more isn't worth it to me. I find selling on ebay a little more annoying because I hate estimating shipping cost, prepping the package for shipping, getting it to the post office, dealing with people not getting it in a timely matter, etc.  I sell on www.kijiji.ca all the time, but that's only in Canada.  Craigslist I believe is similar so might be a good option.<br>  <br>  I would avoid selling individually as you're right, it could take a long time and sometimes that results in only the best stuff selling and you getting stuck with a ton of leftover "less desirable" stuff.  Also, as someone that buys used clothing a lot, I don't even look at the individual items because it ends up being tedious and more costly to me.  People like bulk deals!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lIZkmOEpaa	If you have got any good brand clothes in the bags then sell then at a good price ..

Being dehydrated (usually caused from morning sickness) can cause nausea (and thus creating a vicious cycle, where you can’t drink anything, and therefore get more nauseous, which means you get more dehydrated and can’t drink anything, causing more severe nausea – etc.). If mom doesn’t drink enough to avoid dehydration she may need to be hospitalized for IV fluids. The good news is that once mom is rehydrated (which may be over night or a couple of days), things tend to work out okay. A healthy mom is important to a healthy pregnancy (and baby). <br>  The biggest fear with dehydration in the first trimester, and part of the second, is that there’s not enough amniotic fluid for baby – a significant lack of amniotic fluid can cause baby to lay against the uterus (instead of floating in the amniotic fluid) which could lead to deformities of the arms, legs, and feet. <br>  During the second and third trimester dehydration can lead to premature labor. Actually, dehydration is one of the three most common reasons for labor contractions (the other two are bladder infections and the impending birth of the baby hopefully at full term and without complications.) <br>  <br>  Back to dehydration and premature labor: Dehydration causes blood volume to decrease, which increases the level of oxytocin (the hormone responsible for contractions), and preterm labor results. Often preterm labor can be halted by rehydration – but you want to avoid that scenario if you can.<br>  <br>  In addition, dehydration can raise your body temperature which might lead to further complications, such as muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, or other heat-related illnesses.<br>  <br>  Dehydration is the number one cause of fatigue for pregnant women, and everyone else. Pregnant moms are more susceptible to fatigue since their energy levels tend to be low in the first place. Keeping hydrated is necessary for a healthy, energy filled, and lower stress pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Dehydration Symptoms:<br>  Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:<br>  <br>  Thirst. This is the first sign, and probably the most ignored. Listen to your body – if you’re thirsty, your body is trying to tell you something. You should try to maintain a schedule of drinking at least one glass of water an hour (more if needed). <br>  Dizziness. Dehydration may lead to feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness or vertigo, especially when standing up, bending over, or kneeling. This dizziness symptom is due to low blood pressure caused by dehydration. <br>  Headaches. Dehydration is a major cause of headaches, particularly migraines, in pregnant moms and non-pregnant folks alike. Don’t dismiss your headaches as hormonal (although, those can be a contributor). Make sure you’re drinking at least 10 pints of water a day – more, if you can handle it. <br>  Dark yellow urine (prenatal vitamins can also cause urine to be darker – make sure you’re getting enough water so that the vitamins are being used by your body as they’re meant to be). <br>  Urine with a strong odor (again, your prenatal vitamins may cause this as well – if they are, drink more water!) <br>  Inability to urinate (or, since you’re pregnant, a less frequent need to urinate). <br>  Dry mouth and nose, and chapped lips <br>  Weakness <br>  Nausea and vomiting. <br>  Skin has lost its elasticity or is very dry <br>  If you have any of these symptoms you are already dehydrated - don’t try and ‘tough it out’. Dehydration can become a serious problem very quickly, and can lead to more serious illnesses, as well as cause preterm labor and other pregnancy complications. The best prevention – and remedy – for dehydration is drinking water. Our bodies are made up of approximately 50 – 60% water (some useless trivia: blood is made up of 83% water, muscle is 75% water, the brain is 70% water, and the lungs are nearly 90% water). If the body doesn’t have enough water, it can’t do its job properly.<br>  <br>  Factors that can Increase your Risk of Dehydration<br>  Lack of Fluids: Make sure you drink your water! Especially when pregnant. Your goal is one cup of water for you, one for the baby, every hour. Of a 24-hour day, not just the hours you are awake. Drink responsibly. If you spread your water drinking through the hours you are awake (instead of trying to drink all 48 cups in an hour), there won’t be any complications from drinking too much water. There are cases of water poisoning where people drank water faster than their bodies were able to process and eliminate water. This involved huge amounts of water during a short period of time. I couldn’t find any cases of a pregnant woman suffering from complications of too much water.<br>  Dehydration during pregnancy is a big concern any time of the year, but you’ll probably be more susceptible to dehydration during the warmer months, mainly because of the heat, humidity, increased activity, and a tendenc|`|DN6XtoViaa	well if that little bit of bleeding you had was indeed implantaion (which i think it was!) then you will need to wait at least 6 days from that to get an acurate reading! and 6 days from monday would be the 8th! so test then and if it is negative then test again on the 10th (if nasty period doesn't show!) <br>  <br>  God bless you this month! <br>  <br>  Forgot to add:<br>  after implantation basicly any pregnancy symptom can show! as its the hormon that the baby gives off that makes us so sick :) that said it IS VERY normal to be throwing up and its not to soon. <br>  <br>  make sure you drink lots of water and eat light! hope you feel better :)<br>  Good luck dear!!|`|OHfZFR31aa	If you aren't even due for your period yet, you wouldn't be having morning sickness.

But my doc reassured me that they are normal|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	yah, it takes a while for it to sink in.|`|AA12098289	oh my yesssss..... i think mine started at like 27 weeks and has never stopped  they are contractions...... go to labor and deliverly and get a stress test and they will check to see if you are dialited..  i wasn't dialited or anything but the doc told me to stay off my feet for awhile.... they also took a test to see if i was goin into labor within the next couple weeks..... tho i am now 38wks and 2 days.... i still have the period cramps and last week when i went to doc im still not dialited     period cramps are a sign of preterm labor so i would go to doc.......|`|4b094d2b4369201324fc28eda525fc2baa	thats normal|`|AA11739978	Yup !! thats how i felt with all 3 of my kids! ( and #4 too??)<br>  Good luck.
3F8XBNDNaa	Maybe they're practice contractions? I remember a similar feeling during late pregnancy with my son, it would start on one side, move right round and then my whole tummy would go hard. They were definitely practice ones. Or maybe you're having real ones on and off? I'd ask your midwife|`|1HUXx5Qcaa	yes|`|Mwhclezaaa	At that late, it could be braxton hicks or labour onset.  Or baby feet.  Or stretching & squishing of your organs.  Or anything really!|`|xOkwpFX2aa	Is the baby kicking maybe?  The baby could be nervous and twitching in the womb?  I love your 4d ultrasound, my wife and I did that when she was pregnant, what an experience!

AA11339967	nah. gurl they don't call it a free country for nothing. i no boys. (most of them) are so layed back, and since they are full of surprises and can be rough, so you dont have to act all dainty. (but you do have to control yourself. just make sure you don't go overboard).plus you get a new persectve on everything. the girls perspective(which you already have) and the boys(which they have). i think this can also help you later in life if you have a      son(s).<br>  <br>  some advice though:don't get into it when they talk about hot girls.|`|08dcc3409c097acc6249e2b54c0f780faa	no|`|475c6253e1c25a8313efb22736868bd4aa	No, that's great that you get along with guys that well.  I'm your age, and at school I hardly ever talk to my girl friends, even though I have quite a few.  It's like you said, I'm more comfortable around the guys, they don't get offended as easily, they don't care what I'm wearing, and besides, they're hilarious!  Just be careful, because I promise, at some point these guys will like you in some way.  And it gets really annoying, so make sure you set the tone now - just friends, and never anything else (unless of course you want it to be).  Anyway, that's awesome that you get along so well, keep it up!|`|8639351b94b0fccd5fbd8b31812bc3f3aa	the only problem you might have that when you guys grow up,start families will be very hard for you to keep in touch.Wife's don't like female friends...|`|054aa59e6412961caa59c4b6674bcee0aa	there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. i'm 18 and have had mainly guy friends since about 6th grade. only my very best friend is a girl. <br>  but i agree, it's much easier to get along with guys and the lack of drama is always nice.|`|21d465c969021145c647441cc85caee5aa	Never see friendship from the point of view of the gir or boy. Friendship is friendship whatever may the opposite sex may be is she or he it doesnt maters and it is the age when the maturity will help to have such a nice relationship that even when two friends one boy and one girl sitting sticking to each other but they never think of having sex type of things which other do you feel the same thing then u never need to worry <br>  <br>  so  be cool and enjoy<br>  <br>  <br>  regards <br>  Hemal|`|2677e35e1693480d04c0df9af093c9a5aa	not necessarily as long as you don't end up liking one of them than it will seem award and it may really hurt one of them or you|`|AA11119814	It's good to have guy friends, but it's best to have friends of both sexes.  In the long run, it's really useful to be able to relate well to both sexes.  So keep your guy friends and look for a gal or two that you can get to know also.|`|AA11167559	No it is not bad.  Who you have to be your friends are your choice.  Just as long you feel fine around them, it is okay to have guy friends.  I agree with you on not having as many girlfriends.  To me, girls cause too much problems and I am more comfortable with hanging out with guys anyway.|`|AA11311256	not all at.|`|AA12166870	no . not at all. i have girl and guy friends. but the girls cause to much drama. <br>  <br>  like today i was w/ my friend [girl] and i said something funny, but it was stupid and my friend [girl] got mad. i was pissed.. im the most girly girl ever and i pretty much just hang w/ the guys..<br>  <br>  hope it helped =)|`|b6548b10261a7e5a1be46507ac92484faa	Heck no, guys for one don't cause problems within the group of friends unlike most girls do. They don't talk smack behind your back, they are up front and easier to talk to, and if you get mad at them or they get mad at you, don't worry they forget about it the next day.Almost all my friends are guys, just b/c you have guys as your friends doesn't mean your sleeping with them. sometimes their most likely to go out and do something more fun then just shopping|`|AA11809023	No. I wish I could even talk to guys and feel comfortable around them like that. Consider yourself a lucky ducky. =] Girls really are drama though.|`|AA11073470	Of course its not bad. Friends are friends no matter what.
jCeylLsIaa	Oh yeah!!! one tip: when you miss your period by 3 day or more, buy  test pack (that is if you have a regular 28-day cycle)...|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Most people wouldn't feel any symptoms at only one month pregnnat.. you really start to feel the symptoms of being pregnant at around 7 - 8 weeks which is about 2 months into it. <br>  <br>  Also, I felt like i was going to get my period too in the first month... I kept putting off taking a test becuse I just felt like my period was going to coem any day... well after 2 weeks of waiting for my period I finally took a test and I was pregnant!|`|YFZcl5thaa	It is quite rare, but there have been cases where women have gone into labour at full term and not had a clue. This as I said is very unusual, most women have periods every month and would have other very recognisable symptoms like morning sickness etc|`|E6obQSpraa	Yes of course. Not eveyone has symptoms and the majority dont get any symptoms until about 5 - 8 weeks in their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  A month is very early to be experiencing anyway, and i wouldnt be surprised if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps xxx|`|Q8tf4B5taa	yes not everybody is the same and gets symptoms. Some women are really ill and some not at all. I am on on third pregnancy and in the early stages have only ever felt a bit sick in the morning and a bit more tried than usual with all three.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	I was 6 weeks before I had any symptoms so yes. First symptoms were nausea and heartburn.|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Yes|`|yilREYWGaa	Yes I am one month gone... I have period pains on and off a couple of times was just like I had got my period but I hadnt.<br>  <br>  A Digital Clearblue test confirmed I am indeed pregnant.<br>  <br>  I have nooooooo symptoms but the period pains x|`|UXwFJOwuaa	some women dont get any symptoms at all. other than the period cramp feeling. so the answer to your Q is yes.<br>  <br>  i have a frined who was 6 months pregnant before she found out.. and she hardly showed a bump at all!!!<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|1770c7574e98befdabd3d54687581695aa	yes of course, some women don't get nauseous, or have cravings, but just go to the doctors just to make sure all is ok :)|`|OHfZFR31aa	Most women have very few symptoms during the first 4 weeks. Things like morning sickness, nausea, dizziness, etc don't usually come until 6-8 weeks. But everyone is different.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Yes it can happen.   I was over a month when I found out with both babies and it never hit me really until the test said positive.  Then I was a moody, puking machine.  :)|`|B82wuWx8aa	yup.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i didnt have any symptoms of pregnancy and i even had my period until i was 14 weeks pregnant.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	You could be full term and still have no symptoms. Except for a bit of a tummy, maybe. Some are just so lucky.<br>  Peace.|`|RExvPeD5aa	that feeling of a period coming is what i got when i was pregnant

You will go to jail when everyone finds out, she's not even 18! <br>  Go get help and I suggest you stay with her through her pregnancy if she wants you too, don't just leave her because you were a part of this happening. You need to take responsibility for your actions.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	Oh my god. You're a paedophile.<br>  <br>  I hope that girl's parents find out before it's too late for her to have an abortion so you don't ruin her whole life, or leave her for a younger model when she hits 20. You deserve to be in prison.<br>  <br>  Men like you disgust me.|`|zon13nY2aa	If you're going to tell her parents, my advice is to wear a hard hat and protection gear.<br>  <br>  If this question is real then you're sick and you have broken the law.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	omg you are an animal. i hope you tell her parents that you got there baby pregnant i would so love to be a fly on that wall when you say it.your a dead man walking|`|O5WberWnaa	yeah ok! jail!!!!!      i have just recived a private msg from you and how DARE you call me a fat slag!!!!! you are going to be reported.........and my kids ent bastards you the bastard.....you prick|`|z8jYprWkaa	Send her to prison like you want all the others then you can finish your own education.....|`|fOcItiY1aa	KEEP TAKING THE THICKOMINTS.|`|sk85aiWaaa	Your lucky, go ahead marry her, that's your chance the parent will have no choice but let you be  good lucky|`|i9M0U9Meaa	pedophile|`|20LnuCejaa	Sex with a minor is called statutory rape (in the US).  <br>  You're in deep do-do man.|`|E4WGxzXzaa	just head on down the police station and turn yourself in :)|`|jvBWgajuaa	I think someone is getting a visit from the LAW you abused your position TUT TUT TUT|`|5HS5fyeuaa	The best thing you can do is to tell her parents and pray to God. They may be understanding if you are willing to take care of your girlfriend and the child. Yes, you just did something very dumb. But the deed is done and you are old enough to know what is the right thing to do, even if it costs you your rep. If you love her, you can do it.|`|sIgAQfDcaa	Well firstly I agree with what everyone else has been saying - that's just wrong. Secondly an age gap of that much - 12 years is never really a good thing. Thirdly she's going to have a kid at 16 - and then what's happened to her childhood. Causes huge emotional stuff. And lastly as a 25 year old how come you didn't have more common sense...personally don't believe that either of you are capable of being responsible parents.|`|tBzDmfg8aa	Your looking to settle down? that too with a child? and y not someone ur own age? Did you want a kid or a partner? How selfish can a person be? Have you thought abt her future let alone has it ever hit ur mind whats going to happen to you? You must be real worthless that no other adult could see any good in u, so u went on to take advantage n make a child fall for you? shame on u!|`|wQZ1ycI6aa	Do whatever is humanly possible to support her both emotionally and financially. But remember not to force any decisions upon her. As for her age, you could be in trouble legally, if the parents should press charges.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	JAIL<br>  for <br>  YOU!|`|AA11569882	So... a 25 year old guy started seeing a 13 year old girl... I wonder why people might condemn the relationship?  You belong in jail.  You seduced a child and got her pregnant, that poor little girl, do you even realise what you've done?  You deserve whatever's coming to you.|`|oZRfb0eAaa	what hospitail do i send the flowers to, cause after her family find out,.......|`|jKZkzfNkaa	Thanks for that - I needed a laugh.....|`|AA12103453	Confront them in the Police Station. Then they can't hurt you and you can go directly to jail. It will save the cops and taxpayers time and money in that you just confessed to the crime. Either that or you better hope she gets an abortion and hope it is soon. After all you don't want any chance of the DNA being usable since they could use it to convict you of Statutory Rape, and likely other crimes. Doesn't matter what your mental age is, you need a girl closer to your physical age.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	So when you were 25 you fell for a 13 year old girl?<br>  I'm guessing her parents trusted you to tutor her at home - not only have you broken the law but the trust of her parents.<br>  The reason you are secretly dating is because you know yourself how wrong the situation is.<br>  Sick|`|XSP24wJ7aa	I was goiung to say just stand by her but then I saw the age gap and well you may get done for statutory rape.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	Well as you know you can be charged with statutory rape and placed on the sex offenders register and banned from working with children , as a teacher that may mean you change your career when you get out of jail or at least only teach adults.<br>  As she is only 15 she will need some help and support from her parents but whether or not you are involved in the child's upbringing is another question.<br>  You may be ready to settle down but i think 15 is too young to get married and settle down never mind get pregnant.|`|0Iin6kO4aa	do a runner|`|8uiH6iRbaa	My 19 year old son broke the news that he was gay to my wife and I last weekend. <br>  <br>  I had to admit I had no idea and I reacted badly. I threw him out of the house and burnt all the photos/clothes/memories I had of him. <br>  <br>  I don't understand why he is gay, is it fashionable to be gay? Is he doing this to upset me?<br>  <br>  I don't understand, I have such a revulsion towards him I don't even recognise myself. I want nothing more to do with him - I seriously hate him. <br>  <br>  I just hope that in time my anger will go away.<br>  1 month ago <br>  <br>  <br>  this is a question that you asked a little while back<br>  <br>  ummmmmmmm according to this you already have a son !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  TROLL !!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  if you have a 19 yr old son then how can you be 27 did you have him at 8<br>  <br>  personaly i think your real age is probably about 12 or 13 because that is the kind of question a CHILD would write|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Well you broke the law and should pay the price.  She is 15 so you having sex with her was illegal; also with teacher/pupil relatationships sex is illegal.  You should be charged convicted and imprisoned, made to sign the sex offenders register and banned from working with under 18s for life.  Your assets should be taken to pay for the child's upkeep.  I just hope that you get all that you deserve|`|TUNvbXbgaa	say hello to your jail mates that is sick of you dating a child, why would you start dating a little 13 yr old and you were 25 she is still a child even though she is 15 now.  if she was my daughter i would throw you in jail. can;t you find someone your own age?|`|d89qNyb6aa	Send her to that prison you're thinking of opening.|`|AA10529334	Pervert!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12105454	Oboy!

CUYuAGF5aa	Yeah unfortunetly morning sickness can rear it's head at anytime during the pregnancy.  I had it loads at the beginning and now have it on and off even had some this morning at 38 weeks though definetly has been more occassionaly now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|VC0hx8xvaa	I was really sick the first 3 months too... then at about 30 weeks it came back, instead this time it's let up a bit into real "morning" sickness. Instead of "all-day" sickness lol. From what I've heard every pregnancy can be different... There's really no telling! All you can do is cop e with the symptoms I guess. Good luck!|`|dpCsTIEIaa	My second pregnancy I was sick just about the entire time. They put me on all kinds of medicine. I became anemic and even lost weight like 15 lbs.  But if you are concerned about it you should speak with your doctor. Always feel free to discuss anything with your doctor. After all, you are discussing you and your baby's life.|`|HeBFxZVCaa	yes you can get morning sickness in any of the 3 stages of pregnancy some woman including my sister had it all the way threw the pregnancy and some dont have it at all|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	yep mine has always come bk just not as bad<br>  im now almst 37weeks and am sick most days :-(<br>  the joys we have!!!|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Yes it can...every pregnancy is different u know...

She is the WORST procrastinator and it passed on to me, but when confronted she swears she doesn't do it. She used to tell us to be home by 6 for dinner because thats when it would be on the table. (when my dad got home), but she'd rarely start til 6 30 even preparing it. <br>  She works at 10am somewhere a 10 min drive away and she'll just start showering at 9:55. (how she's not fired, i don't know)<br>  <br>  School used to be a 10 min walk for us and she used to make me wait so she could walk me... I'd be ready to go 20 mins before school started and she wouldn't even be putting on her shoes until I was already late.... so i was late every day..... <br>  I also wasn't allowed to have an alarm clock (because she didn't lke the sound) and she said she'd just wake me up, so i asked to be woken up at 8am so i could leave at 840 and she usually wouldn't wake me up til 830 or so like she was doing me some sort of favor. <br>  <br>  Grrr

a9dfc2976f5905a05b3d54dcf6989a11aa	You could be further along than you think. Some women get their periods, or what they think is there period for a couple of months after they are pregnant. Have a doctor check it out.|`|023967d118a7e80c93c321577e506ffcaa	i am also about 6 weeks pregnant and i feel so bloated. I knew instantly that i was pregnant. my breasts were so sore and my stomach had little twinges. i still get little cramps. i feel like i am several months pregnant not 6 weeks.|`|097827bbbb2b03c0ebf4d327b29009ccaa	bloating is quite normal and the pains are most likely your uterus stretching|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	Yes, I had bloating right away and I gained 5 pounds in a very short time at the beginning of my pregnancy and was out of my regular jeans very quickly.  I think it depends on your size. If you were pretty small to begin with, you notice it very early on.  I know it is normal to gain 3-5 pounds in the first trimester and it is supposed to be water. Well, I gained it right at the beginning and I haven't gained anything since.  I think I was about seven weeks when I had to start undoing my pants when I sat down and my husband took me out to get maternity pants when I was about 9 weeks so I'd be more comfortable.  Dont try to cram into your pants if they are hurting you.
CUYuAGF5aa	I didn't use the clear blue ones but i've heard a lot of people saying they have had problems with them not showing up a positive result.<br>  <br>  Usually any sort of line no matter how faint means it's a positive test because they have become so acurate that they can detect the smallest amount of hormones.<br>  <br>  If your in the UK I used boots own make of pregnancy test and it showed up instantly didn't even have to wait the 3 minutes so would recommend that if you want to try another test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|si770wyhaa	My best suggestion is to use the Clear Blue Digital tests. They say Pregnant or Not Pregnant so there's no confusion. When I got pregnant I took every test they had at walmart and they were all negitive. Then I took a Clear Blue Digital test and it said Pregnant. I'm now 33 weeks along with a baby boy! Good Luck!|`|mCDopsLEaa	Absolutely. Alot of women I know get faint positives and are indeed pregnant. It just means that your hcg levels haven't gotten really high yet. (don't be worried) I would go ahead and schedule for blood work and/or your ob appointment. Congratulations honey!!|`|HeBFxZVCaa	my sister used clear blue and the exact same thing happend and she was pregnant both times so where a few of my friends.|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	I took one on Tuesday and there was a very faint line going down, so i decided to try a first response one the following day and the line was more prominent on that one as it more sensitive.  I dont think the Clearblue tests are very sensitive, but i think any line even if its faint means your pregnant.  Good luck
3F8XBNDNaa	I had a dark control line with an extremely faint pregnant line when 6 wks pregnant with my son. I think you get a faint line because there isn't much hcg at that time, it's not gone far enough in the pregnancy for there to be a strong concentration of the hormone. Might be wrong but that's what I assumed it was. I would say you're definitely pregnant though, congrats!|`|VWyW8tJXaa	I would say you are pregnant. I had some problems with my pregnancy tests, so I bought the difital one. I think it is about the same price but it simply says pregnant or not pregnant. Far less confusing. I took 3 lined ones before finally buying this one. I believe it was also clear blue.|`|2068128233db84cfee68d496e3abb69eaa	because you have two the same i would say you are pregnant if your hcg level is still only low you will only get a faint line try testing in a few days and see if it is darker.|`|pfJorlTIaa	With my 1st, the clear blue pregnant line was so dark.  The 2nd child was also very dark.  for some reason, my 3rd child, i could not make out if there was actually a line there.  I took the test about a week after my missed period, so it wasnt too early..... But i ended up taking 4! tests within 2 days because i just could not figure it out.  Yeah, it turned out i was pregnant.<br>  I guess maybe the line color can vary.  I also took one about a year before that and saw no line at all. (you can tell) and no, i wasnt pregnant.<br>  So, i think even the faintest of lines indicates that HCG hormone.<br>  Best wishes!
oWAUb6vpaa	Yes it can bring on labor but that's not a good thing no matter how far along you are as it can pose serious health problems to the baby if it gets bad enough. Luckily you are as far along as you are because if it were to get serious, baby is mature enough to be born with out the risk of issues that preemies face. <br>  <br>  Lots of water! Orange juice helps a lot as well as the acid helps to kill bacteria, especially if you drink a glass of oj before bed since you bladder tends to sit full a little longer during sleep; this allows the acid to kill bacteria while you sleep. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations mom!|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i have never heard of that, but my SIL had a uti at 38 weeks and they had to get it cleared up before the baby came. im not sure why. i suffer from uti's too (during pregnancy and not during pregnancy) and my midwife has never mentioned this to me.<br>  <br>  good luck though!

I woke up one morning and was able to pick out every small and large thing that needed to be cleaned. The doctors call it nesting. You are making sure everything is ready for the baby when it gets  home. I went into labor about a week later with my first and with my second I went into labor that same night so it hard to tell when you will go into labor. You will lose your mucus plug first which is a lot of mucus that you will notice also having sex will help you go into labor if you are far enough along. Best of luck to you!|`|VEEbzc4jaa	The common term for this is nesting which is basically getting ur self and ur home ready for the new arrival.<br>  <br>  Is it a sign that baby is coming? No, its just an urburn myth that woman do go into labour shortly afterwards but everyone and every baby is so different. <br>  <br>  Im glad this isnt true, im only 31 weeks and ive been nesting for about a week now!!!!|`|AA10381258	My nesting instinct has been coming and going since I was 25 weeks.

1NDHSSqwaa	My little boy has been asleep for 3 hours now. I normally let his sleep a maximum of 3 hours a day but since he didn't sleep well this morning then i will probably let him sleep another hour before i wake him up - lets face it, when he's sleeping is the only time i get housework done.<br>  <br>  As to how long a baby should be allowed to sleep during the day i honestly don't know the answer. In my opinion you should let them sleep as long as they want just make sure they don't nap in the 2-3 hours before their bedtime.|`|5ZvALiclaa	i only wish my 7 month old would sleep that long! <br>  <br>  <br>  If he got to 3pm I would wake him though, 5 hours is enough, anymore and he might not go down so easily in the evening.|`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	Sometimes they sleep more when they're going through a growth spurt.

He will fall asleep at about 10am and wake about 1pm and then just having a nap in the afternoon. Maybe its a growth spurt or something. I just let my son sleep as long as he likes and whenever he likes as he obviously needs it.|`|jPYCrstVaa	sounds like he had a busy day yesterday lol.. i wouldnt worry too much, if hes on a schedual, going off of it one day wont hurt him. he will still be on that schedual. i usually let my son sleep as much as he needs. babies grow when they sleep, and his body knows what he needs.. i wouldnt disturb the little guy, unless it goes beyond 12 hours.|`|oiJITSNZaa	As long as it doesn't affect their night I would let them sleep as long as they want to as he's at the age that he still sleeps alot.|`|DkbMX3rPaa	well that depends how long you want him to sleep at night.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When my son is sleeping through the night reliably or has a cold, I let him nap for as long as he wants.

EWHWPC2Taa	have you tried using an ovulation calculator or calender? these are really good and are very helpful (my opinion)<br>  <br>  good luck to you and god bless. xx
oiJITSNZaa	You're best bet to find out if you even are ovulating is to do ovulating tests. The #1 mistake most people make is they think that since they have a period that automatically makes them ovulate. Wrong! Just because you have a period does NOT mean that you are ovulating. Good Luck.|`|DN6XtoViaa	i had this last cycle as well, but i don't think it means you are ovulating...

If it's stringy and sticky that usually means you are round about your ovulation time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
lJ5Ao2aIaa	"It is funny as I read over the other parent's comments that all the babies started waking up around 6 months. This is when my son began waking up at night also. He had been sleeping through the night routinely until then. Now he is up about 3 times a night and the only thing that gets him back to sleep is nursing him. Here is what I have learned and am trying to implement in my life! <br>  Around 6 months two things happen with babies. First, they begin teething, second, they get more mobile. Obviousy, teething is painful and they desire to be comforted, so waking up wanting mom or dad is not uncommon. Try giving your little one some Infant Tylenol or Motrin, there is also a great all natural tablet made by Hylands that works very well for teething pain. Also, because they are more mobile the need extra calories. Try feeding more often during the day and begin solids if possible. Another idea is to stretch out the time between night time feedings. This takes patience and consistence. If your baby routinely wakes up at 11, 2, and 5 (for example), feed her/him at 11 and then when they wake again try to rock, walk, bounce, etc to get them back to sleep. If after 15 mins or so this has not work, reassess and perhaps feed. The goal is to stretch it out by 15 mins each time until the 2 am feeding dissolves into the 5 am feeding. This is clearly not the easy way to go at 2 am when you are tired and baby is tired but I am assured it works without all the stress of crying it out! After awhile you phase out all the night time feedings, much the same as you would wean a baby from breast or bottle to milk and cup. Hang in there! This is temporary!"|`|bAXpYOAraa	ya not alone, my son woke up every two hours from birth to about 2 0r 3 months.  drove us crazy.<br>  At six months he woke up in the night crying.<br>  I usually checked his nappy.  But to prevent it.<br>  Make sure the baby is clean, warm well fed (and burped well).<br>  My son used to kick in his sleep and throw is arms around and that woke him up so i used to wrap him up tight like a new born. Even his own snoring used to wake him up.<br>  <br>  He's probably doing something in his sleep waking himself up, or having a dream.<br>  <br>  hope that sorta helps|`|foJm2Yftaa	Why not call the Doctor? If he has a problem with his gum go to pharmacy and buy things that take away your pain.  There are some that keeps the pain from hurting for 6 hours or more. Try going to target or something. Good Luck! %Lol%|`|h85kkDsbaa	My son slept through the night from 8 weeks, he even got 2 teeth without waking. When he turned 6 months he started waking in the night sometimes once or more, sometimes he just wants a cuddle and sometimes a feed. <br>  <br>  Your son maybe teething or it maybe a sign to start solids as he maybe hungry.

776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Most women who do that do it because they initially had problems getting the baby to latch properly, and then the baby became accustomed to the bottle and had no interest in the breast at all.  But they still want the baby to have breast milk, so they endure the pump.  <br>  <br>  I always hated pumping too, and I don't think I could do it exclusively.  Moms who do that instead of going to formula are very dedicated.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I think some women have trouble with baby latching on or there is pain during latch on.  I know when I pump it doesn't seem near as strong as when I nurse my daughter.  Those first 2 weeks of nursing we so bad for me, I had open sores and cringed every time she would latch on.  There were times when I would just cry while she nursed because it hurt so bad.  I had a friend who told me to pump to give my nipples a break, and she was right.  The suction was not near as strong with the pump as with my daughter.  It helped immensely.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Some just do not have that close of bond with their child and they think its gross to have a baby breastfeed. I am all for it though because of the bonding part plus its just the awesomest way!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ummm.mmm HELLO to those who thought I was wacko?  The question was wondering why some women skip nursing not what's wrong with those who just pump. Obviously your world needs enlarged!! I am very familar with people that hate breastfeeding but will pump for the baby's good. I said I don't condone it but facts are facts. Please quit judging people so hard. After all this is about answers and personal experiences not just a hard set opinion. Agreed? Give me a thumbs up!|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	There are all sorts of reasons. One of my sisters youngest child had a small cleft palate. Because of that, she could not form a suction latch. My sister pumped and bottle fed. She even had to gently squeeze the milk from the bottle because of no latch. <br>  <br>  My other sister has very very large breasts so latching was not easy at first. She's been pumping for him since. I think she's just gotten so used to it and latching is such a hard thing for her and him that she continues to do that.|`|d6kekKgeaa	my friend only pumped for her first child because she said nursing was to painful - no teeth in the babies mouth - just really sensitive -|`|0CA5eNOCaa	I despise pumping, too! I have a 5 yr old & a 5 month old. I formula-fed my 5yr old, but this go-round I decided to try the breastfeeding thing to see if it really does make a difference : -) I pump every now & then just so my son will have milk if I need to be away from him. (I only pump a couple times a month.) At first, I had latch-on problems but I didn't give up. And I feel like women who quit trying to nurse their babies because of "latch-on problems" just weren't dedicated enough and took the easy way out. I'm not talking about the mothers who pump exclusively due to medical reasons or employment factors. Of course it takes getting used to, but I think more mothers need to try to stick with nursing. There were many times I wanted to give up, too. But I hung in there!!! Plus, there are WAAAAYYY too many sources that offer breastfeeding help to just give up that easily. Especially if you're only problem with nursing is latching-on. There are many lactation consultants in your community & not to mention "the internet experts". LOL. Long story short....breastfeeding (nursing) takes patience, patience, and more patience, self discipline, confidence, and most of all - LOVE. Ur breasts are on your chest to feed babies, not grown men. Women need to realize that more. & I'm not saying that breasts aren't sexual, I'm just saying that some women need to learn how to truly "mother" & get their priorities straight. P.S.- again, I'm not talking about the mothers who have no other choice but to pump & bottlefeed. I'm talking about the moms who just don't want to try.|`|98WKYtfwaa	There can be a range of reasons, latching problems, someone else watching the child, mother going back to work.<br>  <br>  I personally am thinking about exclusively pumping then bottle feeding, simply because i hate my nipples being touched by myself or anyone else, i can't imagine a baby being latched onto them every few hours. I do however think this is just something i'm feeling but when i've had the baby my maternal insticts will kick in. I'm going to try breastfeeding, if it's not for me then i'll try pumping instead of choosing formula, that would be my last resort.<br>  <br>  EDIT* I just thought i'd add more in since i looked at the answerer two spaces above me, i do not think breastfeeding is disgusting, i think it's a beautiful process and it's a great way to bond with all the extra factors of how good it is for both mother and baby. I just personally hate my nipples being touched or stimulated, like i said, i think it's just something i feel now but will change when i've given birth.|`|KVBTtF9faa	I am with you. I had to pump for my twins because they came 6 weeks early and were in the NICU and were too small to take from my boobs. But I much prefer nursing. Currently I'm tandem nursing my two youngest ones (2 years old, & 5 months old) - it's a great bonding and is also comforting to them. There are so many benefits to breast feeding, for both, mother and child. I don't understand why some women don't breast feed but then complain about how they want to lose their baby weight. BREAST FEED!!! Duh. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question - some women find breast feeding "creepy" and "gross". For instance, when I was on cafe mom, I ran into a bunch of these types. They said they wanted their babies to have breast milk but they refused to ever bring their baby to their breast because that was "perverted, and gross, and just wrong", which is one of the reasons I left cafemom.com and never looked back. I will never understand that mentality. Breast feeding is what our boobs are made for, and it's one of the most natural things we can do with our bodies. There is nothing sexual, gross, or wrong about it. But it's all in their mentality and how they've been programed by society and the men in their lives.<br>  <br>  I don't buy it when women say they have latch issues because there is a lot of support for nursing moms. Le Leche League is a great source and they have chapters everywhere. Breast feeding does not hurt when it's done properly. If it hurts, you're not doing it right. <br>  <br>  Also, pumping depletes a lot of your supply. You have to take things like fenugreek, blessed thistle, and drink mothers milk tea to keep your supply up when you pump.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	I think there are probably a hundred different answers to your question....physical limitations, preference, convenience, etc.  I know you hate it, but you should try to remind yourself just who and why you are pumping and maybe that will make you hate the chore a little less.  Some women can't even do that!  Try to be positive.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's almost never their first choice.|`|0wTzlG2haa	I had twins and nursing was very difficult for us. They simply weren't getting what they needed and I was getting frustrated. One of them had jaundice, badly, so we needed to supplement with formula from the time he was about 3 days old. Neither of my sons latched on well at all and we found that pumping was simply a better way to go for our family. I was commited to our boys having as much breast milk as possible and pumping and bottle feeding was the way to make it happen. It wasn't fun...but pumping became a part of our daily routine and we made it work. I ended up able to give them about half of their daily nutrition from breast milk in a bottle and the rest from formula. We did that for 10 months.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I did, but not by choice. Like someone else said, it usually is not by choice. My son was a 34 week preemie born at 4lbs 4.5oz. He was too small and too weak to nurse from my breast. I tried every day to get him to latch but he was just not physically able to. I hated doing it as well. It was important to me that he got at least some breast milk though. I ended up drying up at 3 months and switched to formula. I planned on breastfeeding but I just had to roll with what I was given.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I had to exclusively pump because at 3 days old my son got sick and needed to be supplemented with formula for a few days, so he liked the bottle.  He refused to nurse after wards.  Not by choice, but I wanted him to still have breast milk.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I have a friend who exclusively pumps. She wasn't able to get her daughter to properly latch on, and the more weight her daughter seemed to loose the more she was pressured to give her daughter formula...she opted to pump. She's still going strong at 6 months.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	well its usually not a choice. maybe the baby wouldnt latch. im pretty sure those women would nurse if they could. no one likes pumping
xwZV9jgPaa	get what they call a "walking epidural", you will still be able to push and you will feel pressure during contractions not pain. You don't feel then move down the birth canal and you wont feel if you rip...Most of the time your dr will be able to tell if you need an episiotomy and will cut you instead of letting you rip (a Straight edge cut heals better than a jagged edge or ripped) sometimes when you are pushing with the walking epi, you might feel like your pooping or you have too poop....its just the pressure of the baby's head against your rectum...nothing to worry about. You should have your baby handed to you after you give birth so you may not even notice the after birth....alot of times they just push on your stomach for you and it comes out or they may ask you to push one more time...it doesn't hurt. The worst part would be between the time you start having real contractions and the time you get the epi....i fell asleep after i got my epidural.|`|ybexjS2Paa	Lol I see you got yourself really worried and nervous. When it comes to contractions the gap between them is painless but when you keep having them every 1 min or less well they seem like endless pain but it bearable as thousands of women give birth every day and they are fine. I got epidural, with the first one 3-4 hours after the contractions started every 3 minutes with the second child as soon as I could. Moving around helped me a lot. Don't worry you will be just fine :) Good luck and congratulations|`|Zdp0GlyUaa	Hay hay hay, Calm down, I'm due in 12 weeks yeah I'm nervous too but you sound as if your panicing if you panic it will be worse, Maybe you should talk to your midwife she will be able to talk you through it, but no body's labour is the same everybody is different you may have a really quick and easy labour, My advice to you is to stop panicing coz it will only make things worse, I'm going there with an open mind yeah I know its going to hurt you don't get the most amazing thing for nothing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kvvlkSQ1aa	What can make labour painful is adrenaline. In most situations adrenaline helps but during labour it's counterproductive. Adrenaline causes the cervix to attempt to close in case you need to run from danger. It's the pushing against the cervix that makes it tough. If you can relax enough so as not to let adrenaline take hold it will be much easier.|`|8brZAonnaa	hi i didnt find labour that bad and i have a low pain threshold if you have a good midwife it makes all the difference she can keepyou distracted and keep your mind off the pain which is wat i done i found the birthing balls helped alo twhen the contractions came..i would recommend you to stay away from the gas and air as it does send women high as did with me i was unable to calm down after taking it most of alljust keep thinking about the baby your going to see when its all over...ps your due date is my sons first birthday... good luck|`|SiIuJXvwaa	the most painful part of labour is giving birth to the head but yea labour is labour of course it hurts but there is medication you can get to help you through it relax and you will be fine|`|f7e12ac154c295f52b12b5ba786537c3aa	just calm down and nobody will leave you in too much pain and im sure you know every one is different and once you see your little one you will forget all about any if there is any pain jjust stay calm|`|AA11661793	Labor really hurts like hell. It is like period cramps times 1000. I think the worst was right before I started pushing. When the head came I didn't feel it so much because of the pain from the contraction. I had a shot of Stadol but it didn't work for me so I was going to get an epidural but they couldnt get it in for some reason then by the time they got done poking me 15 times in the back it was time to push. I had relaxed while they were trying to ut the epidural in it made me finish dilating. Yeah it hurts but its not anything our bodies can't handle. As for tearing not everyone does, I didn't. When you deliver the afterbirth I didn't feel that I was holding my baby and all my pain was gone. I can't wait to do it again in August!|`|Ac6iEjDtaa	There's no reason to be nervous. You have to be positive and relax. When my first husband died in 2000, I was 2 months pregnant and had to deal with everything alone. I worked from the place away from my parents, and was working till I was a week away from my due date. I broke my bag of water while I was in the office, I didn't tell anyone. I went alone to my doctor who told me to go right away at the hospital. Yet I had to get my stuff and the baby. So I went back to where I live. I travel back alone to the hospital where I had to pay a deposit first before they entertain me. I was inside the delivery room when I started contracting. At first it's like a minute or two gap.. Yes between contractions, it is painless. Every contractions, you felt like pushing and holding your breath. But don't do it. It will stress you more. Try to relax instead, then, after 6 contractions, I felt my body shaking, really hurts. There you have to know, it's time for a big deep push.(Doctor will tell you when it's time) You have to push like you taking a hard dump, and don't lift your butt, instead, laying there, push your butt flat at the delivery table, never twist your body. (I don't know how the delivery table here, but where I deliver m baby, the table has something like a belt around it, where you can hold. That's the best way to get strength.) And no, I didn't feel the head coming out, or me tearing. Here's some link for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stages-of-labor/PR00106" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stages-...</a><br>  Before the delivery, have a discussion with your physician about any pain medication you wish to receive. If at any time during labor you feel you need pain medication, just let your nurse know.You will be alright dear. Congratulations!|`|FfNjsqGvaa	Life is what you make it. Your perceptions come from many things, including your culture. Our culture villifies labor. It emphasizes the trama of it. For some reason this was lost on me and I was nervous for my first labor, but not really scared. My baby was face up and it was a bad labor, the kind that I would have died from years ago. When labor was done I thought to myself that it was not that bad. I just didn't think of it as 'bad'. And apparently is was abnormal as far as labor goes. So when I got pregnant again I was not scared. My baby was face up again, and this time my baby was bigger and would not fit out and I had an emergency C section. Both my labors were unsual as my baby's were big and face up. But I still am not scared of labor. I still don't consider it a bad experience. I don't feed into the fear of it. <br>  <br>  There is a nomadic tribe that I read about years ago. The women walked along with their tribe, while in labor. When it came time to push, she went behind a bush, pushed the baby out. Tied the baby to her back and caught up with the others and kept walking. <br>  <br>  I don't know how to explain this without writing a book, lol. But life is how you think. The lens that you see labor through will determine what kind of experience you have. <br>  <br>  My first I had morphine. The second one I refused all drugs until it was time for the C section. I had natural labor with him for over 15 hours before I took the medication. My labors are not normal. A normal labor would have had the baby out way before. But my babies are big and face up. So yours will be way better than mine. Most women's are. And my labors were not a tramatic experience.<br>  <br>  Our culture does strange things around labor, like having you lay on your back which works against gravity. Does not stress preventive measures like exercise, diet, etc. They stress medication, and fear and 'just get through it' attitudes. This all goes against the woman's instincts. This is why I had a midwife for my second baby. She went with my instincts and even though I had my baby in the hospital she made sure that the doctors and nurses didn't 'take charge' over my own maternal instincts. Labor is a natural thing and you are built for it. Your instincts will guide you. Does it hurt? Sure it does, but to me that didn't matter. It was not a big deal. My second labor was fun because I had the midwife and I had a great partner there and we laughed between contractions and had alot of fun. <br>  <br>  To me it is natural. Not something to fear.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	first of all try and stay calm everybody is different my labour really hurt but i have had friends that have said it wasn't that bad. Contractions hurt and you should be painless in between them, but as the labour progresses they get closer and stronger. When you feel the erge to push that was more like a relief for me as i knew the end was near pushing the baby out looks more painfull than it is thats my opinion because by then your contractions will be really strong and you won't notice the baby going down the canal. The first bit is getting the head out that can hurt as it does feel like things are streching. Once the head is out the rest just slides out. Delivering the afterbirth isn't painfull as it is not as solid or big as your baby. <br>  <br>  After you have given birth you will bleed a lot so make sure you have maternity pads. It will feel achey down there so give your self time to rest and perhaps take painkiller. Going to the toilet can hurt for either one. Opening your bowels first time after birth can be painfull so be aware of that. If you tare then urinating can sting, i used toilet tissue that is moist you can buy it from the supermarket its not a rough as normal toliet tissue.<br>  <br>  The main things are contractions get worse at the end, the most painfull point in labour was my contractions. With my first i had a tens machine, birthing ball, gas and air, pethadine and an epidural. With my second i just had gas and air. <br>  <br>  Remember though at the time you will probably think i never want to go through that again but at the end the pain does go out of your mind as you have this beautiful baby infront of you. It is true what they say we forget the pain, you always rememeber it hurt but not really how bad it was till you have another lol. good luck you will be fine and on the whole it's going to be an amazing experience you will never forget!!!|`|SFNXSLumaa	First of all, relax! It is going to happen, no matter how much you worry. The contractions are what hurts, and the time between them is painless. As labor goes on they get longer and more intense. My labor wasn't great, it was a total of 31 hours and as soon as my boy was born I forgot all about it, I didn't even notice the afterbirth! You are so busy looking at the baby that you don't care whats going on down there! I had epidural after 21 hours. Next time I will get it alot sooner!! It isn't painful to get it at all! I could still feel my contractions abit, but very bearable. When it came to pushing I felt alot of pressure and I pushed and could feel him slide back abit in my birth canal when I stopped pushing. The last couple of pushes hurt me, it just felt tight, what I didn't realise (because of the epidural) was that I was tearing, I couldn't feel it at all And I tore really bad! (my sons head is 1 inch bigger than average!) I then couldn't feel them sew me up either. The most painful point was the contractions before I got epidural. If you want epidural, don't wait until it is unbearable, sometimes it take awhile for the guy to get there and do it, so when you start to think about it, ask for it!!  The afterbirth I think came almost instantly after the baby, my legs were still in the styrups for half an hour after the baby was born (to sew me up) but I didn't care and I couldn't feel anything! Epridural for me wasn't scary at all, I could still move my legs and wiggle my toes. Hope this helps!|`|UXwFJOwuaa	Hello...i have had 2 children i will go through both my births seperately as they were both different.<br>  <br>  with my son, i had lower back pain at the begining and felt liek i needed to poo for the beginning part of the labour.... i couldnt lye on the bed and instead leant on a chair but was on the floor. (you need to find a comfortable position for you.  i had diamorphine with him andthis makes you very sleepy between contractions and you are not really in control of what is happening you have to rely solely on your midwifes to tell you when to push.... my labour was 9 hours form start to finish and the most painful part didnt last long as it was the head coming out but believe me when i say you dont notice the time going by. he was 9lb and a half oz<br>  <br>  <br>  my daughter was completely different i had period cramps in the front of my stomach and needed to pee all the time. i only had gas and air with her and it was a much better experience i was in control the whole time and knew exactly what was going on. again you need to listen to your midwife. i was lying on my side on the bed with her. and my labour from start to finish was about 4 and a half hours. she was 8lb 14oz<br>  <br>  for both my children i made myself think the worst possible thing (which for me was, haveing to be rushed for an emergency section!!) i imagined this was what was going to happen so anything else happening was good news. <br>  <br>  the best advise i can give you is relax, listen to your body, when you are in labour you will know and only you can decide when its time.<br>  the most painfull part of labour is when the babys head is coming out (crowning)  because you feel it coming down then going back in and then coming down and going back in but push as hard as you can and for as long as you can and it will be over really quickly. <br>  <br>  as for the after birth you dont even notice that becasue you are already holding your lovely baby and you will have had a jab in your thigh which casues the placenta to come away from the wall of your womb.<br>  <br>  i really hope this helps. something else that helped me to realise what i was to expect (especially for my first child) is to watch all the birth programmes on tv. Discovery Home and Health has lots of really informative programmes. be ready for your baby and have everything organised so that you have no other anxieties. <br>  <br>  good luck best wishes xxx|`|gEtg9LOiaa	Labor isnt what people say. It is a lot of pressure in your lower back and hips of course! If you focus your mind on something else it makes it easier. The contractions do hurt in between is nothing it doesnt hurt at all. No contraction is unbearable we are woman we are made for having babies. If you get the epidural you cant feel nothing which is great. I had it with my second my first I didnt and I could feel everything the dr cutting me the babys head shoulders and all hurt. The afterbirth is nothing you cant even feel it because it is so small without that big baby in it anymore. I had an epidural with my second if I were you I would get that if you cant stand pain. Relax and dont try to fight the contractions this will make you very uncomfortable. Just breathe, take pictures to look at while in labor to keep your mind off what your going through. All and all in the end when you hold that baby everything you go through is going to be well worth it because this is something no one can take from you. Enjoy every minute of it.|`|p5zvl7hIaa	Think its yes to all your questions there :-)<br>  <br>  The contractions start off as bad stomach pains which gradually get worse.  I can only remember bits and pieces of my contractions.  I had an epidural with my first and wouldn't really recommend it.  It slowed everything down for me.<br>  <br>  I had gas and air with the second and I think I coped pretty well with that.  The most painful part is the crowning, when the head appears.  I also found the shoulders of my second painful, but she was a big baby.<br>  <br>  I tore with both pregnancies, which is fairly commen.  The after birth doesn't hurt what so ever.<br>  <br>  All labours and births are different and it can freak you out not having control of everything.  I'm due to give birth to my 3rd child in 2 weeks and I'm nervous too.<br>  <br>  I always think of it as a day of uncomfort, but look what you get at the end of it :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jXblvTG0aa	it feels like really bad cramps @ first the most painful part is when the head crowns about 1 min...|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	wow lol<br>  <br>  contractions are pretty much the most painful part you can feel the head coming out and tearing ( if you do) not everyone tears. it was a burning sensation to me like an indian sunburn.you can feel the baby moving down and it's a TON of pressure and pushing relieves some of the pain but it's exhausting. after birth didn't take too long maybe 10 minutes or so but i can't remember and it doesn't really hurt- the most painful part for me was right before i started pushing|`|MtC3CWZraa	I had a baby exactly a week ago via induction, which generally means extra painful contractions. I was only in pain when actually contracting before I got my epidural. I held off until I couldn't just breathe through the pain.<br>  <br>  It was the best decision! After that, I felt only pressure during contractions. I felt basically nothing during delivery and it just made the whole process so much easier. <br>  <br>  The only downfall was that I was confined to bed and it made me itchy. I'll take a little itchiness over labor pain though. I was back up and able to move on my own about 4 hours after delivery and have zero after effects.|`|0MunIx8raa	Whew.  I think it varies from person to person.  My first son I decided to have pain meds and the epidural.  It was very unpleasant.  The pain meds had me looped and I was sick feeling from them.  The epidural was not so bad and I didn't feel a thing.  NOW, with my 2nd son...totally different story.  Since I had such a bad time with my first I decided to not have pain meds and only the epidural when I felt I couldn't take the pain anymore.  I dilated to about a 4 and I absolutely couldn't take the pain anymore.  I asked for the epidural and I was so tense they couldn't get it in.  They stuck me a good 20 times.  Finally they had to give me a little bit of pain meds to relax me enough to get the epidural in.  Once I got it I fell asleep for a few hours.  By the time I woke up the epidural had worn off and I was ready to just die!  It was time to push and it was the most excruciating pain I have ever felt in my life.  My son was 9 lbs and was a pretty big baby to have to get out.  I felt every single inch of him coming out.  It hurt unbelievably.  I was really ready to be shot in the head and get it over with.  It was horrific.  I did not tear, my doctor was great and actually massaged the tissue "down there" and worked my son's head out so that he wouldn't have to cut me, which is great..no healing from that.  Once he came out I was in so much pain that I didn't even look at him.  The afterbirth is not really painful to deliver, but the mashing on your belly trying to get it to work it's way out was.  I said after him that I would NEVER have another child.  And he's 10 now and I will NEVER have another.  I will NEVER forget how bad that hurt.  Never again.  Good luck!  Get the epidural.  That's the only advice I can give you.<br>  <br>  Add:  I forgot to mention that the doc had broken my water 12 hours previously to me giving birth and it was a completely dry birth.  This did not help the pain factor and it might not have been so bad if not for that.  What am I saying?  It would have hurt either way.  It's like I would push and he would move 1 inch then suck back in 2 inches.  It was awful.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Is it just the contractions that hurt and the gap between them is painless?<br>  For me it was painfull half way into the contraction, it would build up in pain until finally easing off, There was no pain inbetween contrations.<br>  <br>   How long was your contractions unbearable for? About a minute or so. <br>  <br>   Can you feel the head coming out and yourself tearing?<br>  I could feel burning when the head crowned. I didnt feel myself tear. <br>  <br>   Can you feel the babies body moving down the birth canal?<br>  I could slightly. <br>  <br>   Does it hurt to deliver the afterbirth and how long does it take?<br>  It took me 20 minutes, I had the injection to help it come out quicker and reduced bleeding. <br>  <br>   What was the most painful point in your labour and have you got any tips or advice for me to help it go smoothly?<br>  Most painfull part was pushing her out. Be mobile and keep breathing!<br>  <br>   What pain relief did you take? <br>  I took Gas & Air, and Morphine. <br>  <br>  Good luck with the new baby!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	honestly yes its hurts a lot<br>  but each women handles it different<br>  for me the contractions are fine until i get to about 8cms then they are very bad but i managed with just gas & air and im a baby when it comes to pain!<br>  for me the head coming out has always been the worse bit u have to push through the pain yet your body naturally fights pain so u try not to!<br>  <br>  after birth quite easy coz by then u are more  interested in the baby than whats happening down there<br>  <br>  if you need strong pain Relief ask for it no one expects u to be superwoman and just cope<br>  try to stay calm and relaxed x x x|`|fbguVOiQaa	Yes, It does hurt, but holding your baby after the birth will make you soon forget any pain. When the pain get unbearable you can have pain relief. Gas and air is good at first. The afterbirth isn't pain full to deliver(compared to the baby)<br>  I think for me, the most pain full part is getting the head out. Make a birth plan and have a supportive birth partner.<br>  Good luck|`|nrvKkcZoaa	when it comes down to pushing and getting the baby out, you wont notice any of the questions you are asking it goes so quickly and after the baby is born you will most likely forget how painful it was, thats why i cant really explain how painful it was as it all went away after holding my presciuos babies, i didnt feel the afterbirth coming, and didnt even know it was out! just keep thinking about that beautiful baby you will holding soon, just relax for now and dont worry about the birth, woman everywhere are coping with child birth and im sure you will too!! congrats on your baby|`|hbuwryL9aa	are you planning on having a home birth or a hospital birth? i can defiantly say that giving birth at the hospital is way more painful.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	good job i'm a taxpayer then geoff isn't it!|`|1jwbQaZTaa	for me, the contractions were the most painful part of it all, but as they come, you learn to make your way through each and every one. they feel like menstrual  cramps, but much more intense.<br>  <br>  i wont sugar coat it, having a baby f**king hurts, but its a pain that goes away once baby is out, and you forget all about it. just when you feel like you cant handle one more ounce of pain, it stops. and your baby is there, and it was all worth it.<br>  <br>  im actually looking forward to my labor and delivery this time around.<br>  <br>  its the most exciting day of your life!! <br>  <br>  i did my delivery naturally and you just gotta focus on getting the job done, remember each contraction and each push is getting you one step closer to having your baby here. if it was reallyyy horrible, people wouldnt still be reproducing, and plus, its what your body was made to do! good luck mama!!! :D|`|8uiH6iRbaa	calm down !!<br>  you are two weeks away from giving birth you really shouldn't be stressing your self out right now x<br>  well what can i say !!!  <br>  <br>  first of all i can only tell you what my experience was like <br>  i can't say weather it will be painfull or not for you because everyone is different and eveyone has a different pain barrier<br>  <br>  contractions didn't hurt for me i just found them uncomfitable and they were slightly twingy but i found them bareable. yes the gap in between is painless so take the time in between to relax and rest (your going to need all the energy you have. )<br>  <br>  i found my contractions bareable untill the midwife broke my waters then it really hurt (was so painfull i had to have an epidural)<br>   but then after that my baby had problems and he's heart stopped so i had to have an emergancy c-section so i can't answer the rest for you sorry !!!!!<br>  <br>  i do know that it isn't painfull to deliver the after birth that sort of just falls out rather than pushing it out and it is a lot more smaller than the baby (you would of already done the hard part)<br>  my advise is to stay calm breath slowly and do everything at your own pace. <br>  <br>  gas and air helps its more of a distraction than a relief but it can make your mouth very dry so make sure you have plenty of water <br>  <br>  try to stay active for as long as you can during labour as this can help things move quicker !!!<br>  <br>  please stay calm it will all come together when the time comes and then you will wonder what you were worring for !|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	After giving birth 4 times already and being 6 weeks preg now these questions are really hard to answer as every birth is totally different. I will start with my 1st. I was in labour for a total of 4 hours and everything progressed really nicely, yes it was painful but i didn't require any drugs or stitchers ect...She was a preemie baby born 4 pound. My 2nd child i felt my 1st labour pain at 10.00pm and she was born at 11.42pm, we only just made it to the hospital in time. It was again totally drug free and i required no stitches, she was born 5 pound. It was soooo painful because of how quick everything happened. My 3rd was different my waters started leaking at 5.00pm and i didn't start labour until 11.30pm that night. By 3.00am i was in soooo much pain and after being told i was only 3cm's dialated i was ready to give in to drugs. Fortunatly i didn't and after 2.5 hours of pushing my baby was born at 7.48am, 8 hours after my first pain. My daughter was in a posterior position which means that her spine was against mine, it causes excrushiating back pain that prolongs labour and dialation. I thought with my 4th i would get lucky like the 1st and 2nd, how wrong i was....I woke up at 12.50am with some little niggly pains, by 4.30am everything was moving nicely so we went to the hospital. On arrival the midwife did an internal and found that i was 8 cm's dialated, i was so happy because although i was uncomfortable i wasn't in that much pain. Well at midday the Dr started to panic as the heartbeat was dropping and they had broken my water and i still wasn't progressing. I had to end up having an epidural (which i would not reccomend) and my daughter was sucked out with the ventouse machine. My daughter was finally born at 1.48pm, i had been in labour for over 13 hours and i was 8 cm's dialated for 7 hours. Again she was posterior position. Now to answer your questions. The most painful part is the last hour before the birth when contractions are 1 minute appart but lasting 50 secs which means you basically have no time between them. The ferther dialated you are the more painful contractions are, so at 10 cm's you are in maximum pain and ready to push. Yes you can feel the head coming out (providing you haven't had an epidural) and it feels amazing to know that it's almost time to meet your baby. I have never torn or had stitches so i can't comment on that one. I can't say that i actually felt the baby coming down the birth canal, thats what your contractions are doing. Advice.....WALK, WALK, WALK...don't get on the bed until you are ready to start pushing. Listen to your body it will tell you what to do. Don't fear birth, embrace it and you will feel so empowered. Birth is the most beautiful thing in the world...Good luck.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	All I can say is its bearable pain babe, don't get me wrong, its bloody sore but when you know its not gonna go on forever you just seem to cope with it (the gas and air help!)<br>  The contarctions are like having really sore period cramps but as they come and go you get relief when they stop until the next one. Its only really continuous pain toward the end. With my first my contarctions started at 5.30am and I waited til 7pm to go to the hospital and start on the gas and air (contractions were 4mins apart by then) <br>  The most painful bit, for me anyway, was the head coming out, its excruciating but doesn't last that long really. Then the rest just flies out after another push or two. <br>  The afterbirth isn't sore at all, I didn't even really pay much attention to pushing it out, I was too busy looking at this little baby lying on me! <br>  <br>  My advice would be not to panic and to take whatever drugs they offer you. Lots of people don't agree with me but with my first I had gas and air and morphine injection in my *** - he was 8lb3oz and a doddle.<br>  With my 2nd, I only had time for the gas and air and found it far more painful and he was only 6lb3oz. <br>  <br>  You'll be grand babe. Good Luck, hope everything goes well x
joZFuLEwaa	I agree she should be perfectly fine.  My sister in law flew to Portugal hen she was 5 months pregnant.  That is a 6 hour flight from CT (USA)  She was fine.  She was also worried though but her doctor said she would be ok.<br>  <br>  Not sure why someone gave me a thumbs down.  I also know of someone else who got married when she was 7 months pregnant.  She went on her honeymoon to Hawaii.  So guess how long that flight was?  Nothing happened.  She and the baby were fine.<br>  <br>  As always it is best to talk to your doctor before flying when you are pregnant.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	No!! She is pregnant, not illl!! Airlines have no restrictions on flights until around 28 weeks.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Unless her doctor feels there is a reason she shouldn't,  no she should not cancel.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I flew to Egypt when I was 8 weeks. Don't worry, she'll be fine!<br>  <br>  The only problem I had was my morning sickness kicked in big time lol|`|wxImZRssaa	I flew at 5 weeks, and at 8 weeks, its not a problem.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	no it will be fine as long as she hasnt had any problems with the pregnancy at all ie bleeding. good luck|`|x5aJcD9zaa	I flew from Australia to the UK and back again when I was in the early weeks of pregnancy.  I didn't know at the time, and when I found out when I got home, I talked to the doctor and he said everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  The only time they worry is when you get bigger, say after 26 weeks, when the pressure of the cabin can have adverse effects such as premature labour or fainting (because of the altered bloodflow in your body).<br>  <br>  At 8 weeks, its no problem.  It's only a 2 hour flight as well, so don't worry at all.  :)|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Alot of airlines wont let her travel unless she is between the stages of 13-26 weeks. (Basically the 2nd trimester is the safest) <br>  <br>  Seeing as shes only 9 then i would cancel. Mind you i was 2 weeks pregnant when i flew home from Florida and was unaware i was pregnant???<br>  <br>  Dont think it will be easy getting insured either|`|uqnQ9Y9haa	She should get a doctors advise, usually women shouldn't fly the first 12 weeks of pregnancy or in the last 6 weeks, the pressure can cause labour. I had  a friend that didnt listen to her doctor and went on a flight 2 hours long with 5 weeks of her pregnancy left to go,now she wishes shed listened.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i have heard that it is not safe to fly in your first or third trimester, but having said this i went on a plane when i was about 7 weeks pregnant but i did not know it at the time. I think it is up to you really you could be fine most people probably are but do you want to take that risk.|`|rr9Cp87haa	She will be fine. I travelled to Iceland at 19 weeks and am 22+2 now. I did wear the scholl support stockings which are recommended for pregnant ladies as your at more risk to DVT when flying whilst pregnant.|`|3F8XBNDNaa	Unless there are medical reasons which are a cause for concern, she should be fine.|`|Zdp0GlyUaa	No, Go and enjoy it, I am 28 weeks pregnant and flew at 23 weeks so don't worry|`|SyuGWtq0aa	No she should be fine to fly
3F8XBNDNaa	The only way to know his thoughts on the matter for sure is to have a good chat with him. As you've been together some time, maybe he is thinking about the future more and that commercial may to him have been the perfect excuse to bring the subject up, especially if he has no idea how you'd react. Have a good talk together, find out what you both want from your relationship and go from there :)|`|faPKwClPaa	I don't know.  Ask him.<br>  <br>  It could have been an offhand comment, or he could have been (in a pussyfooting sort of way) looking to get your opinion.  Either way, if you guys can't have a grown up conversation about having kids, don't have 'em.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Ask him. No one here will know what his meaning or reasoning for asking was. We would only be guessing. <br>  <br>  However if your not ready or not sure. Explain that to him. You shouldn't have a baby until you are ready and sure you want a child.|`|71fSlHuPaa	Guys dream alot. Sometimes they say they want things but they really don't when it happens. Give this some time before actually getting pregnant. Make sure this is what he wants. I would wait a week, maybe even a month and see if he brings it up again or you can bring it up and see  how he reacts. DO NOT GET PREGNANT JUST BY THIS NIGHT. Could be all talk or like I said dreaming.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I'm 32 and believe me at our age yes you really start analizing your life at the moment and you start seriously thinking about the future. Unfortunatly you may not be at the same time in your life, as your partner is.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	If you're that close you should be asking him that, not us!|`|b2952b6264919c4d0478fc6d9b014e95aa	It means he's ready to talk about it, which is what should happen before you actually do it.  <br>  <br>  Talk, talk, talk.  Be honest and put everything out on the table.  He may want one now, and if you're not ready you need to be honest about that, or he may just want to know that you want to do it someday, or that you love him enough to want to do it with him.<br>  <br>  Children should never be something you compromise, both parents to be need to be on the same page and equally ready.  <br>  <br>  You also need to talk about your parental philosophies before you get pregnant.  Having completely different ideas about how to raise children will kill a relationship not to mention mess up the child.  You need to be a united front from day one.
oiJITSNZaa	Wow! Most doctors recommend 6 month minimum for food due to the baby's digestive system isn't developed enough yet. Anyways How about some cereal before she goes to bed plus her bottle. Cereal tends to stay in her stomach longer and thus feels full longer. My four month old is drinking 8 oz every 3 hours no food yet. Good Luck|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Feed her whenever she's hungry.  She won't overeat.  Maybe she's having a growth spurt.|`|vCq3dR40aa	Not sure why someone would give a thumbs down to feeding a baby when it seemed hungry.  <br>  My baby was breastfed and didn't start food until after 6 months, but she didn't seem hungry.<br>  My recommendation would be to add an additional bottle feeding during the day and more food if she seems hungry right after the bottle.  <br>  As to the night awakenings, it may not be food related.  Food is both for nutrition and comfort.  Check other answers for 6 month old sleep habits.  It is a developmental thing that babies 5-6 months old may start waking up in the night due to teething and / or mobility and increased stimulation causing full awakenings.  You can read about the developmental issues in Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child
eWEqGHvJaa	Sorry to say you could be having a baby in the next 9 months. With your regular moon time and unprotected sex the chances are very good. It is a fact that even with him getting out quickly it only takes one wiggler to make it to you egg.  There is only one real way not to get pregnant and that is not having sex.  No fun but that is it. Hope this helps.|`|HeBFxZVCaa	im sorry to say but yes you may become pregnant as a male has pre *** which is released during sex in small amounts there are little swimmers in the precum who can get to your egg and impregnate you.<br>  pulling out is not a good form of "contraception" a male may think he has pulled out in time but the chances are sperm has still got in and i said you can get pregnant from pre *** too.<br>  i advise you take a home pregnancy test 7-14 days after you had this unprotected sex.<br>  good luck babe:)|`|MTgkrlfkaa	The main risk of coitus interruptus is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly, or may not perform the maneuver in a timely manner. Although concern has been raised about the risk of pregnancy from sperm in pre-ejaculate, several small studies have failed to find any viable sperm in the fluid. Make a test to be sure, but the chances are not as high as the media always says|`|UXwFJOwuaa	you can be. and you probably should have taken the morning after pill the next day to prevent pregnancy.<br>  <br>  pulling out is an old fashioned myth for stoppping prenancy. but some semen is secreted from the penis when he is aroused so it is not an effective method and i would get checked out so that if you are you can have time ot prepare yourself.|`|rWJGEHVZaa	there is every chance you could be...pulling out doesnt stop you getting pregnant id go and buy a pregnancy test just to make sure that way if you are you can start preparing....good luck|`|SiIuJXvwaa	my friend for the last 10 years has been doing that pulling out only the last time it happened she was left pregnant she is due on the 29 april
0zWJlNi1aa	My son sometimes looks at me when I call his name, sometimes he doesnt.   I think it depends on his mood!<br>  <br>  Although sometimes when Im calling his name and he doesnt look at me I can see him starting to smile as if he knows he is playing a joke on me by not looking!!!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I noticed these things with my son at 6 months.  We did get into a neurologist appointment at 9 months.  He should answer to his name by 9 months.  The lack of eyecontact is not a normal finding at any age.  It may be a quirk he will grow out of or it may be a symptom of a larger picture.  If you are worried, call early intervention, they will assess him for free and give him therapy if he qualifies and if he doesn't you will be relieved.|`|GVPhFa3Raa	Hi, my daughter is the same.. we have to clap or make a noise to get her attention lol. she does turn her head at times thou.. im sure there is nothing to worry about!! xx|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	My son occasionally will turn to his name. He is sitting by himself for a minute or two, putting everything in his mouth, rolling over, reaching for everything, switching hands, etc. He's not really interested in crawling. Loves to stand. My PAT instructor is extremely pleased with him. I would say that as long as your son is still hearing things, I would use his name as much as possible and see what happens. If you get really concerned call and talk to the pediatrician.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Does he look towards loud noises and the like?? Do you think he has any other reason for you to believe he would have a hearing problem?<br>  <br>  He will start to recognise his name eventually, sometime from now on is normal so I'd say that he is on track. <br>  <br>  If in another couple of months he is still not responding to his name or loud noises in general i would get him tested but I'd say he will be fine!|`|h85kkDsbaa	I dont think you need to worry, your son sounds fine to me. All babies are different and do different things at different times, my son has just turned 7 months he could recognize his name from 6 months but has no interest in getting up on his knees to consider crawling.|`|WVPRUzLuaa	i have a friend with a kid that has autism don't worry to much he is still young but keep an eye on things he just might be a bit slow in that aspect i also have a son of 2 and twin girl of 8 mths boys are very different to girls i always compared my son to my niece that was 4 mths older than him and it worried me alot but boys are just a bit slower than girls so please don't compare him to any one Else kids they are individuals i always went to the doctors about my sons progress but they told me exactly that but i would maybe see a doctor about it and they will tell you what might be going on|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	This is normal don't worry. He will need some help from your side though!<br>  Babies usually "start" responding to their names when they're about 5 to 6 months old. Use his name frequently when you talk to him, and after time he'll be able to make the connection between himself and his name, and turn to you when you call him.|`|YuTFG3feaa	Yes, my son responded to his name at 6 months by turning his head in the direction of the person calling his name.
AA12384954	He sounds fairly similar to many, but not all, 2 year olds.  My son was very hyper when that age but he sat in the child seat in the trolley and I gave him a new Golden book each time which kept him occupied in the supermarket.  I also took snacks and had a drink on hand.  Somehow we managed to do all the shopping fairly quickly.  Perhaps you could try keeping him up a little later than 8pm so he may sleep in a bit more for you.  My son also liked the 10am one hour sleep, then off and running again!  I found he enjoyed and relaxed by swimming - maybe that would help expel some energy.  I would recommend a book I read about that time "Toddler Taming" by Tony Attwood, as it had some very good tips inside.  Good luck.|`|DXzUCgj8aa	give hima smack on the bottom|`|08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	I hate to say it, but I think you do need to be more firm. It can be really hard as a parent to put your foot down as children know every trick in the book to make us feel like we're being horrible! It's natural for small children to want everything their way, but it's an essential part of growing up to learn that you can't always have it.<br>  <br>  You say "We dont like the "cry it out" and never used it" about the sleeping in his crib, but I have to say that's the only thing that worked for me in the end. My son was terrible at going to sleep, he would only go to sleep in his cot if I physically jiggled the mattress for ages; after one too many nights of armache I bit the bullet and tried the "crying it out" method. I can't remember where I read about it, but the technique I used was to leave him for a while, then go in to him and comfort him so that he knows he hasn't been "abandoned", then leave him to go to sleep by himself, again leaving it a little while before going to see him if he starts crying again. Each night, you leave it a little bit longer before going in to him, until he knows that, although you are there if he really needs you, you won't come to him the moment he starts crying. It actually worked really well, I had about a week of feeling horrible every night, listening to him cry and being overwhelmed with the urge to go and comfort him, but after that he started to calm down by himself, and soon he was able to go to sleep by himself happily. He really didn't seem to be damaged in any way by the experience, and I'm convinced it was the best thing to do at the time. He was about the same age as yours when we tried it, iirc. I think if you leave it much longer it will be harder, as he will be even more used to having it his way, plus he'll be able to get out of his crib more easily.<br>  <br>  Thinking about the waking up at 5am thing; that seems pretty early - do you think there could be something waking him up at that time? Does anyone else in the family also get up then, or is there noise outside at that time in the morning? It could even be something like the heating system coming on. My kids stopped waking up so early when I bought thicker curtains! Of course, if you don't mind him waking at 5, try putting him to bed just a tiny bit earlier than usual (literally just 5 mins earlier at first) then, really gradually, move the bedtime a few minutes earlier each day. <br>  <br>  My son was actually very similar to yours, by the sound of it, very active and curious, and quite difficult to control with a terrible temper. I found time outs to be the most effective way of dealing with him, as most other things tended to prolong the tantrums (which could get REALLY bad!). Leaving him by himself to calm down was usually the quickest way of getting past the tantrum so I could explain to him why he shouldn't have done what he'd done. Often, after a few minutes of being by himself he'd have completely forgotten what he was crying about!<br>  <br>  Whatever you try, you need to stick at it for a while, as he will try to test you to see how far he can push you before you give in, especially if he's got used to getting his way. This stage can be really hard but if you give up too soon you're just reinforcing the message that tantrums and bad behaviour will get him what he wants. He absolutely needs to learn that there are limits, and that you won't give in to him. But, at the same time, he needs to be certain that he is loved & valued, so make sure you give him lots of hugs and attention when he's being good. From a psychological point of view, rewards are much more effective for learning than punishments are. Don't forget that even negative attention can be seen as a reward, so giving him lots of attention when he's naughty actually makes things worse - be firm, calm & "businesslike" when punishing him, keeping talking to a minimum. Just tell him, in a simple, straightforward way, what he has done wrong, and put him in time out until he calms down. Seriously, it really does work, even for "uncontrollable" children.<br>  <br>  I can totally identify with what it's like to be doing this alone, I'm a single parent and have been since he was tiny, and it can be absolutely exhausting and demoralising. I'm not going to give you a lecture about making your husband help out more, since I realise that family circumstances can make this difficult (I know many people need to work all the hours they can in the current financial climate!), but if he could be around just a tiny bit more, and if you can at least share with him how you are feeling so he can support you emotionally, that would no doubt help. Sometimes kids pick up on your mood and act out more when you're feeling less able to cope, so anything you can do to help yourself feel better will also help his behaviour, and will give you more mental strength to deal with it.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend the "Toddler Taming" book, it's got lots of really sensible, down to earth advice, without being|`|oiJITSNZaa	Sorry but its way past time to put your foot down! What discipline do you use? He definitely needs more sleep and would improve behaviour wise if he got some. Crying don't hurt. When he climbs out discipline consistently...he will learn after awhile. After all who's in control you or the boy?<br>  <br>  As for the stroller and cart strap him in! Even my 3 yr old I still strap in. I just hope you wake up and realize that you are raising a lil brat. Sorry but he does need to recognize parental authority. He cannot run the house and your life like that. Trust me I know. Good Luck|`|06aa9fa2de755aa9281677e30b6cd432aa	Spank him put him in bed, Just don't give in or you will never have control over him, He will know that he has won.<br>  And yes the father needs to help out it takes two to make him then it will take both of you before it gets way out of hand.<br>  And yes he is beginning to going through the nasty 2's.<br>  Good luck.|`|HVI7JIqzaa	He has you wrapped around his little finger....and he knows it.<br>  Put Your Foot Down!<br>  Some times the threat of a spanking is enough.|`|ZM93vzxpaa	just slap the little sucker|`|QhCy2009aa	I can so relate to having a son like that. He was my first, out of 4 children.He wore me out, everyday...LOL...Into everything, climbing, touching, tantrums etc...it was non stop..<br>  As you know having others, they are all wired differently. I found with him, that he just had a strong inner drive or inner motor, that always wanted to keep going and going. What fueled his temper tantrums were food sensitivities not food allergies.  Food dyes and such....<br>  Some are more easily stimulated too, and with kids like this, you just have to be very creative, and really structured as much as possible, so they know what to expect. <br>  <br>  He just turned 17 and is a handsome, organized, honor roll student, with friends and leading a awesome life.... so it does get better.;)|`|ZrS4I4lNaa	Try a naughty mat (like supernanny uses) but mats are better as you can be consistent and take them out with you when you go out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.magicfairywings.com/time-out-mat-p-1007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.magicfairywings.com/time-out-...</a><br>  <br>  Also, perhaps try engaging him more. For example when you go shopping, draw him up a little list of things for him to get and give him pictures of what's on his list so he knows what to look for. That way he'll be more focused on the shopping rather than running riot. If he's not and starts having a tantrum.....throw down the mat =)|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	He sounds like a pretty typical toddler in many ways.  I understand completely though, as I have two like this.... one is almost 3 years old and the other is almost 2 years old.  It is impossible for me to take them grocery shopping as they both hate the cart and hate holding hands.  My husband and I take them together now though.  We figure if we ban them from this stuff now, they will never learn how to behave in public places.  We also found that if we just trust them, they do a lot better than we expect!  For instance, we let them walk by themselves, not holding hands, in the grocery stores.  They have never broken one thing!  They just walk through with us and look at everything at their level.  And they get to help put some things in the cart, such as the butter, or ice cream, or a box of rice, etc.  Give him some chances to show you what he really wants to do.  And don't tell him no.  Tell him, we can't do _________, but we can do ________.  Like, you can't pick up the spaghetti sauce, but you can put the spaghetti noodles in the cart.  Kids go nuts if they hear "no" all day long. <br>  <br>  About the sleep thing.  Put him in a toddler bed. My son went in at 15 months with no problem, and we HAD to switch my daughter at 18 months because she just hated the crib. Period.  Once we put her in a bed she did great! I'd try it, as he is old enough.  Especially if he is a climber, you need to for safety.|`|AA11648899	Get your husband involved anyway...<br>  <br>  It's HIS gig too.<br>  <br>  Even to use him to say:  "if you don't listen - wait until your father gets home!"<br>  <br>  It worked for me.

It is possible that the brown spotting was in fact a period. Your lining might not of been that thick. You should call your gyno and tell them that if someone cancels before you appt then you would like them to call you so you can get in earlier. But since it is only 2 1/2 weeks away they might not have any. Was the blood test a quality or quanity?

7b9bea0d33c87d626dfaf34fcd417e0aaa	In North America, doctors often suggest that pregnant women refrain from eating sushi due to the risks of parasitic and bacterial contamination. As to eating the cooked items, the basic answer is that if you are making the sushi yourself, it should be safe, but you may not be any safer eating california roll in a restaurant than eating the raw tuna there. <br>  <br>  The problem is cross contamination. If any contaminated fish is cut with the same knife, or placed on the same surface as your california roll, then your cooked roll will then become contaminated. My wife and I struggled with this issue during her pregnancies and found two solutions. The first was to simply ask the itamae (sushi chef) to use a clean knife and a different surface to make her rolls than the others. We are regulars and were comfortable asking that question, and when told she was pregnant, they were happy to oblige our request. We ate sushi a lot during her pregnancies :)<br>  <br>  The second solution would be to make sushi at home. This may seem a daunting task, but is surprisingly fun and easy. In fact, you can find detailed instructions to make sushi at home at:<br>  <a href="http://www.sushifaq.com/howtomakesushiathome.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sushifaq.com/howtomakesushiat...</a><br>  <br>  You can also fine out more information about sushi safety concerns and health at:<br>  <a href="http://www.sushifaq.com/sushi-and-health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sushifaq.com/sushi-and-health...</a><br>  <br>  As to what you might still want to eat, California rolls are an excellent choice, as are other cooked items such as unagi maki (eel rolls), and the various tempura rolls that are often offered (mmmm, shrimp tempura roll). If you are making sushi at home, your options expand greatly and you can make any kind of roll you want, for example, cooking salmon and making you own cooked salmon and avocado rolls (actually quite good, especially when still warm). Use your imagination.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Warren|`|8fde5dccb87a1282536ebcda082dbb59aa	The problem with siushi is the less-than-fully-cooked meat.<br>  <br>  So if you're just eating the vegetarian stuff or something fully cooked, go for it!  =)<br>  <br>  BTW... About 2 days ago, I went to a place that served teriyaki chicken & pineapple skewers (lightly sprinkled with sesame) on a sheet of nori.  By the third one, it was reminding me of eating siushi, just from the fragrance it had picked up.  Now I'm craving siushi, too, but there's no decent place to get it around here.  =(<br>  <br>  Ah, well... guess I'll wait six months and take a little road trip!|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	I think that these kinds are fine.  I have had them.  I dont see why they wouldn't be because there is no raw fish in them, just seaweed.  It is probably a good idea to ask the doctor though.  I've gone once for sushi because my husband was bugging the crap out of me to go,  so I just had the ones without raw fish and  also had some fried stuff.  I was sorry though that I ate the fried stuff because I ended up throwing it all up when I got home.  I told my husband I will not be going fot sushi again until I am not pregnant anymore!  Anyway, it should be fine.  I love sushi too, and miss eating it!
OdGHnebPaa	If you're already going back to the clinic why worry about testing again otherswise?<br>  Wait until Saturday. If that test shows negative, you're not pregnant. Don't stress though, already having taken a test with a negative result a week after your period was missed it's rather unlikely you're pregnant.<br>  If you REALLY want to be sure ask for a blood test instead of urine.<br>  If you're really set on taking another test before Saturday any day would be fine since its already been a week since you missed your period.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	I tested with an at home pregnancy test 7 days before my period was due and it showed positive.

i0Exuxi2aa	Wow, I know it must be hard feeling unappreciated. I get the same feeling all the time, only my situation is not as bad as your's. Just know this, no father does not love his child. I believe he might be embarrased of himself, thought at the same time very proud, seeing what kind of person you have turned into. It might be overwhelming for him to see how his son is this mature teenager. He loves you as his son, and I know you feel unappreciated, but your father knows that too. Believe me, keep your patience, and the more your father will look up to you. If you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to e-mail me. Best of luck!  : )
UXwFJOwuaa	you may just be prone to it. some anti biotics will work other ownt and it will be trial and error to get the one for you<br>  <br>  <br>  Cystitis is more common during pregnancy. The action of pregnancy hormones results in changes in the urinary tract. The tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder (ureters) and the bladder become relaxed and dilated, and there is an increased tendency to infection. <br>  <br>  Some women will have infection and no symptoms. For this reason, urine is tested at each antenatal appointment to look for signs of infection, diabetes and pre-eclampsia. <br>  <br>  Drinking plenty of water and passing urine when necessary (rather than 'holding on' for hours), reduces the risk of a urine infection developing. <br>  <br>  Symptoms of cystitis are;<br>  <br>  <br>  More frequents trips to the toilet.<br>  <br>  <br>  A stinging sensation when you pass urine.<br>  <br>  <br>  The stinging sensation may be due to an infection, but can also be due to vaginal infections such as thrush. <br>  <br>  It is impossible to predict whether you will suffer with cystitis during pregnancy. Needing to wee more is one of the normal signs of early pregnancy, but if you develop pain when passing urine, or a fever, arrange to be seen promptly by your GP or midwife and take a urine specimen with you. <br>  <br>  If there is evidence of an infection, you will be treated with antibiotics (there are several that are safe to be taken during pregnancy). This is because there is a small risk that an untreated urine infection may lead to miscarriage or premature labour.|`|GiX4f022aa	Hi,<br>  I use to suffer from Cystitus alot, there are these sachets of stuff you can get that you drink with water that clenses your system to get rid of the infection and bacteria that causes the pain. What ever you do dont drink coke or pepsi and stuff like that it only makes it worse. Drink about 2 litres of water a day and make sure you flush it out. Being pregnant might also be making it worse, I would consult another doctor if it still stays the same.....it approimately lasts for a month.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	it is common when ur pregnant it could be something to do with yr hormones or the way the baby is lying, otherwise could be just that ur run down and unable to fight off the infection. u should def consult yr doctor for advice. cranberry juice is good but u need to drink 2 glasses a day for 3 wks for it to start to take effect. u can buy cranberry supplements anywhere that sells vitamins.   good luck.|`|oCTG5IVvaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I had never had a water infection until i got pregnant, at first i didn't realise i had one until routine testing picked it up.<br>  I was given antibiotics and it went away.<br>  Then at my 15 weeks midwife appointment she thought i might have another one, but test came back negative..i'm not so sure.<br>  Anyway, i asked the midwife what more i could do to prevent it as i always drink gallons of cranberry juice (helped me through morning sickness!) and water and hate fizzy drinks.<br>  She said theres not much you can do, because where the body is producing more blood (when you're pregnant) the kidneys cant cope with it all and things just aren't being dealt with quick enough and sometimes infections build up.<br>  I know this isn't much help, but i thought i'd let you know what i got told.<br>  I hope you get sorted soon and keep doing all the good stuff you are doing - drinking cranberry juice etc.<br>  Just be persistent and keep on at the doctor. Couldn't they refer you to a specialist perhaps?<br>  Good Luck<br>  x x
S5H0NmEWaa	It's up to your friend. All you can do is tell her your concerns. Try to empathise with her - she may be afraid of being pregnant and prefers not to know. Alternatively she may have some other issue which is preventing her from facing up to the situation. If you can talk to her calmly and as a friend, instead of antagonising her, then you may be able to discern the best approach to take to convince her to take her situation seriously. <br>  <br>  It does sound like you need to do a bit more research, though - a scan can't tell who the father of a baby is.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	I think you should drop it now. you did all you can do. As much as you'd like to you can't make her go. perhaps she wants a child?|`|AA10529334	The scan isnt gonna help her to know who impregnated her. <br>  <br>  Yes she should be tested but you cant force her. Maybe buy a home test and give it to her.|`|VEEbzc4jaa	The scan wont be accurate enough to define who the father is so she'll have to have a DNA if she cares about finding who the father is.<br>  <br>  She sounds very irresponsible and is now not owning upto to how shes been behaving lately. She probably not going coz shes scared to what it may say. Should have used protection then!!!!!<br>  <br>  Let her deal with her own problem and at least you can say you've tried helping.<br>  <br>  Does she know your on a forum talking about her personal life, coz ur not making her sound very good??|`|vizOzFbtaa	You cant, its not your choice|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	She's an idiot for not listening to you. Either she's to frightened of the possible outcome or she's doing it all for attention. There's not really a lot you can do if she's not willing to take your advice. <br>  <br>  A good idea would be to maybe point out the dangers of what she's doing. STI's that aren't treated can lead to major health problems in the future - and besides she could have contracted something life threatening like HIV. Not to mention the dangers of having a baby without any medical help and supervision. <br>  <br>  It might help if you offer to go with her to the GUM clinic or doctors because she might just be scared of going alone.|`|gEtg9LOiaa	Its okay. Most women dont want to go to a clinic if they are scared! Go out and buy her a home pregnancy test! Tell her that you and her are going to go to your house to get something and then give her the test there and let her take it. This might make her feel a little more comfortable. Also tell her that this baby if she is pregnant deserves the right to be healthy because she is already too far along for an abortion anyways.|`|sIgAQfDcaa	It sounds to me like your friend wants to be pregnant, and maybe knowing who the father is isn't important to her. I would buy a home pregnancy test and give it to her - as for the rest of it, you're not sleeping with her, so you don't have to worry about STI's.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	unless she is lying to you and she hasn't slept with all the men she says she has id leave her to it she when she's in labour she will know she is pregnant that's it the little thing is born ok|`|3F8XBNDNaa	Maybe you could let her know of the risks she is taking with not just her life, but possibly the life of the unborn child too, if of course she is pregnant. It sounds as though she is but it also sounds as if she's scared of knowing as this means a lot of decision making and also perhaps letting people (ie her parents) know of her pregnancy. Maybe she's scared also of having possibly caught something. Having the scan won't tell her for sure who the dad is, it may give her a better idea as you'll have clearer dates but the only way to know for definite is DNA testing. There's not much you can do as if she's determined to leave her head stuck in the sand then nothing you say or do will change anything. You could try reminding her that it would be an awful shock if she were to take a trip to the loo one day only to have a baby and not a number 2.|`|UXwFJOwuaa	why not just buy a home testing kit? they are just as effective. it can be quite a daunting thing to go to the doctors about. but there are also family planning clinics which are fantastic and very understanding about this sort of thing. <br>  <br>  maybe she wants to be pregnant. she is being very childish and naive. the scan wouldn't be able to be accurate in finding who the dad was. you due date if you are pregnant counts back to when your last period was.  the scan would only measure and give a rough conception date. <br>  she is just stupid and inconsiderate. and she sounds as if she is really young, is there no one you can tell?.. (maybe not about the amount of times she has had unprotected sex!!) but that you are worried about her.

Your parents are right to be upset you were disresctfull in thier home.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Just hang on - you're out of the house in a little over a year. Very few parents have an easy time accepting their homosexual child's sexuality, and no parent would be happy to catch their child "in the act". Keep it in your pants until you're out of the house. Your parents will get used to the idea with time.|`|wO7ecSdgaa	they are homophobic they reject homosexuals or maybe they are scared that other parents might think that they raised you wrong or they think what you did is wrong and disgusting..<br>  Well you should have completely locked ur room so ur mom wouldn't see you and ur friend playing wit each others "thing".
gYegoecNaa	"my parents aren't as cool with it as I want them to be."<br>  <br>  You need to allow your parents time to adjust.  If they've just gotten what they would call a "salp in the face" then they need recovery time.<br>  <br>  There is no scientific evidence that confirms homosexuality is genetic.  There are however several theories, but then again, there are several theories on every topic out there.<br>  <br>  You are maturing into a young man, you need to be able to make decisions, and responsible decisions and choices.  By you going behind your parents back by seeing your bf on the weekends, that's betraying your parents trust.  If you want to gain the respect, trust, and understanding of you parents then going behind their backs is the wrong way of doing it.<br>  <br>  When you sit down and talk with them, do your best as much as it can get very frustrating to not have a yelling match, control your feelings.  If you find that you cannot sit and talk with them, write them a letter, and pour out your heart.  Sometimes parents need to see it written.  <br>  <br>  This is something that's going to take time, and you need to give your parents and also yourself time to adjust to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and best wishes!|`|fQxSClHKaa	i know it's hard,<br>  but you need to sit down and talk with your parents.<br>  explain that you can't control your sexuality to suit them, and that you have strong feelings for this guy. tell them how it's wrong to ban you from him, because they wouldn't do the same if this were about a girl. it's discrimination.<br>  after you talk to them, and they still don't understand,<br>  i'm afraid you will have to wait until you are 18 and an adult, because then they can no longer control you.<br>  good luck !|`|yV3FjYLLaa	You and your parents need to sit down and have a grown-up conversation about the situation at hand.

For that is the Devil in you.<br>  <br>  In Cor. 6:9-11 "homosexuals" appears in a similar vice list and Paul comments that anyone who continues in these sins will not inherit the kingdom of God.  <br>  The homosexual who repents and believes receives the same cleansing, sanctification, and justification as every other believer who turns from sin to Christ.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Well, you have to be smart enough to know that the sneaking around is wrong.<br>  <br>  If what you feel for this guy is real then it can wait another year or so until you are 18.

Usually i would say your not though, When you think you can be preg sometimes your head makes you think you are, but take tests and good luck, if you are congrats.|`|8314f3287b5aab7045a53d0cbe3dd7c6aa	i do not think you r pregnant... maybe the stress make u feel all those things... but if you wanna sure... u can take another test... :)|`|AA11670417	i think u need to let da test show more true colors|`|c2bdbb9af5403c03774585a719332524aa	your kidding, ewwww|`|ddedbc127882908124f02d72d552592aaa	Most of the symptoms you've listed are symptoms that show up very late in pregnancy, when the uterus is heavy and pressing on the bladder and stomach.  If you just missed  one pill and took it the very next morning, it is doubtful that you're pregnant.  Stress can cause a period to be late, so if you're very worried about it that could be contributing.  If you don't start in the next few days, you should go to a dr. or clinic to see what's going on.  Good luck!|`|894f46e8f885bd2c93a7a85b11a82562aa	test again in about 2 weeks...too early to tell right now|`|AA10785287	Yes, pregnancy tests can be wrong sometimes, the most accurate kind is a blood test and second to that, the hospital urine tests.
0nIwKd5Uaa	Sadly I know people in both situations.<br>  <br>  A couple I know have shared custody or 50/50 and the judge placed no court ordered child support. The judge did however put court order to pay for half of daycare, medical, and things like that. Just so that it was on paper that both parties were equally responsible.<br>  <br>  I also know a guy who actually has his son roughly 9 months of the year and he still has to pay child support and all the other 50/50 stuff.<br>  <br>  I personally think it should be situation #1.  That if it's shared or 50/50 there shouldn't be a court ordered child support. Only the court ordered medical daycare etc.<br>  <br>  If both dad and mom of the child get along try talking to her to see if she would be willing to loose the child support. If not talk to a child support lawyer. But be careful with those lawyers a lot of them are pro women not just pro child.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	50/50 custody laws vary state to state. Many states, including my own, will still have a custodial parent and a non custodial parent on paper, making the non custodial parent have to pay child support. <br>  <br>  It is a good idea, however, to get things on paper! If the mother changes her mind at some point, none of the money he has given her so far will count. They will be considered gifts and he will be ordered back support in my state. You must get this agreement in writing. You do not have to go to court for this, but you need a witness or a lawyer to make sure that if she changes her mind on this agreement, that he will not be screwed monetarily.|`|Mwhclezaaa	Avoid court- it will cost you more than you would ever get back & cause bad feeling with the mother.  Best to keep things civil.  Bear in mind, even if you feel that he is paying lots for his son, withdrawing anything will only mean his son will suffer.
lc57ntoFaa	My husband hates the fact that I am pregnant just for that reason. I have no desire to have sex. Since the day we conceived. Lol. We were going at like bunnies, then I was just like "ok, that's enough, sorry hunny, you're on your own". The thing is, some ladies can go either way. If you are uncomfortable, then don't do it. Sex is supposed to feel good for both people. As far as the wetness goes, it could be you just aren't in the mood. I gave my husband a few mercy "lovings", but we used lube, and, it well... didn't last too long. So whenever he gets the urge, it's either oral, or the hand deal. lol. As far as the discharge, everything that doesn't seem "normal" when you're not pregnant, is pretty much normal when you are. It's just the hormones, and keeping everything clean down there. It could also be a yeast infection (which are really common durring pregnancy), or maybe when you were in the shower last you missed some soap or something. You should find out for sure what it is. Maybe go see a doc or ask your midwife for further info on it. Odds are, you're fine. Good luck with everything, and tell your partner to suck it up.. not that much longer!!!!|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's called lube. Just get some and your dryness problem will be solved.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|AA11961524	I had more or less the same problem. Not only was my interest low but I was not lubricated enough and then there was an uncomfortable tightness that made sex with my husband very difficult (being tight is normally a good thing but not in this case). I spoke to my doctor and was told that the area had an increased blood flow which was responsibility for all the difficulty.Now it has gotten alot better. Sex is fun again and my husband is a much happier man.<br>  <br>  I wrote all that to say, give it time and your interest will return.The thick discharge could be normal because that tends to happen when you are pregnant but if you want to be sure, ask some questions and get checked at your next appointment.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|QIwhMrBraa	i was the opposite, when i was preggers i was horny as f**k though unfortunately i didnt want it with my husband at the time so i just went without <br>  <br>  yeah, its normal to go off sex, its also normal to go crazy for it, hormones do funny things and u cant always predict which way they will take u<br>  <br>  the white discharge i think thats normal in pregnancy dont mean infection necessarily either<br>  <br>  best x|`|nrvKkcZoaa	i was the same for both pregnancies, sex drive went straight out the window. as far as the thick discharge it could be normal as your discharge does increase when pregnant|`|SFNXSLumaa	I had no sex drive, my poor husband hasn't had sex for months! And he still has abit of a wait (gave birth 4 weeks ago) So what you are feeling is completely normal. You need to talk to your partner, sounds like he needs to be abit more understanding, you are carrying and giving birth to his child for goodness sake! He has it easy!!|`|igPBuDHkaa	i was ok with my first two pregnancy's with this little one am 13 weeks and i just dont want him near me its normal not to want sex when your pregnant sometimes its the man that gets put off as well lol
3F8XBNDNaa	It could be that you're pregnant, or you could simply be experiencing a different period than you normally would. Sometimes if you're stressed (and for numerous other reasons too) your periods may change or stop altogether. I would do a test as the light bleeding you refer to could possibly be implantation bleeding. If a test is negative but you have no period next time or another out of the ordinary one, I would see your doctor.|`|zyaYJTRBaa	NO...... >:3|`|71fSlHuPaa	Invest in a pregnancy test or go to the doctor, then you will know. To me it doesn't sound like pregnancy, but then every woman's experience can be different. I would get a pregnancy test to be sure.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	Could be. I had one period after I got pregnant . You should wait till your done with this one and if the symptoms don't go away , get a test|`|e29442e71576c7cfa0d2e2adc37601e3aa	It could be an implantation bleed. Have a surf on 'google' but get a pregnancy test, thats the best option.
HDS3IGj1aa	try hindunames.com|`|n0WnEIopaa	Huh?<br>  <br>  All I got from that is that your 2 month old doesn't have a name yet.. <br>  <br>  Very confusing question..
oiJITSNZaa	Ummm.mmmm perhaps you got the wrong section?! LOL unless somehow you're Trying To Conceive!!! LOL
uP08b6K4aa	Couldn't agree more with you, all these cloning experiments are just asking for trouble in my honest opinion.<br>  <br>  Surely parents should only want what's best for their children in that they are born healthy regardless of gender, the colour of their hair or eyes!  Did I hear it called 'designer baby' somewhere?<br>  <br>  That said, there is the argument towards some families carrying genes which carry hereditary diseases that perhaps one gender will carry and not another, in that respect, it's obviously a good idea to use such medical breakthroughs.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is the price we pay for advances in science, there will always be someone to take it too far and sometimes accidentally invent some drug or operation which at first may seem safe, but over the years prove the opposite.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Im ok with screening out disease, although that is a slippery slope.  I think its wrong to go into choosing sex and hair color and all that.  Its too far away from screening out medical issues to to close to eugenics, if it isnt already eugenics.<br>  <br>  I feel like if a parent isnt going to love their child because of their sex or gender or hair/eye color etc, then they dont deserve to be parents, and I am NOT going to help them become a parent.<br>  <br>  As far as the situation and position the poster above me takes, that is where I say that they shouldnt have had children at all.  If your birth parents honestly didnt love you because you were a girl, what happens if their son becomes trans gender or homosexual?  What happens if their son does something else they dont like?  THey werent bad parents to you because you were the wrong sex, they were bad parents to you because they were bad parents.  It would have been something different, but I promise you had you been a boy, it wouldnt have been any better.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I know I stand alone on this but oh well, bring on the thumbs down.<br>  <br>  As a Child, I was taken by the State, because I was a girl.<br>  My life givers hated the fact that their perfect life with a son, was ripped away because their Child was born with a vagina not a penis.<br>  My Eldest Son (adopted) was also in a similar situation, only him being a boy instead of a girl.<br>  <br>  If it saves a Child's life, or gives them a life without being hated upon, I am all for it.<br>  People can live in denial over these fact, but some people who walk among us, do find these things important. I'd rather them have what they want, than a Child be born and end up either dead or spend a life in State care.<br>  <br>  If they want a daughter, or a Son, or blue eyed black hair, go for it.<br>  Will I do it, no. But if anyone else wants to, they should be able to.<br>  <br>  Midnight - Not having a go at you :)<br>  I know it would have been different if I was a boy. The life givers gave birth to a Son not longer after I was in state care. I met him a year or so ago, and he had a pretty sweet upbringing. BUT I am happy for my life. I have wonderful parents now. :)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think it's stupid to do it just to have a good looking child... but if you want to do it to remove genetic codes so your child doesn't end up with things like Neurofibromatosis (like I have) or HuntingtonsSarcomaa then I don't see the problem there.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	The choosing of anything like that should be limited to the prevention of birth defects and disease.<br>  To choose something cosmetically is just wrong...if you hate your own looks then don't have a baby.|`|811sLIoEaa	i hope you are a non native english speaker.<br>  <br>  Even though i disagree with it myself... i find your rant quite annoying|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I just saw this on the morning news and like you I disagree.  I can understand genetic testing if a major illness is involved but the rest come on what ever happened to accepting what you got and being happy and loving it for what it is.<br>  <br>  The doctors are the ones that need to stop all this mad scientist crap.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Doing it to get rid of genetic faults, such as mental illness is actually a very good idea, making it so your child won't be prone to depression or anxiety will be useful (wish some one did that to me), but doing it so they'll share the same interests or the hair colour you like, is going too far and close to nazism as you said.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	It is silly, especially at a time when we recognize that beauty can exist in many forms. Also, I think people have a false sense of security. Every blue eyed blonde is not stunning.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	This is ridiculous.  The parents that would choose to use this are crazier than the scientist/doctors developing this option.|`|w5uHiNcoaa	This just shouldn't be allowed. It does seem to me that this sort of thing would just be the start of a very slippery slope.|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	Yeah I was going to mention Hitler......<br>  <br>  I disagree with any of it

ybexjS2Paa	If she has no fever and it's not freezing or raining then I think it's ok to take her out. My kid's ped always says that. Just make sure she is wrapped up warm and she will be fine.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I would take her out anyway - do you have a raincover you can put over her buggy, so the wind doesn't irritate her sore eyes? Maybe not for a whole hour, though.|`|wphLaVs6aa	I bet she would love a change of scenery and some fresh air. I'd take her for the walk. I always found that when my son had a cold, he seemed more content when we went out for a bit. I think it's a nice distraction from the sniffles. As long as your daughher is warm, I don't see any reason at all why you shouldn't enjoy a walk together.|`|5ZvALiclaa	I think you should still take her out (rugges up well) for maybe half an hour for the fresh air. The cold air might make her nose run a little more but that is normal, it doesn't mean she is getting sicker.<br>  <br>  She will enjoy the distraction and the fresh air will help tire her out so she sleeps better too.<br>  <br>  have a nice walk!|`|h85kkDsbaa	I always wonder this when my son is unwell so i asked the doctor is it ok to go out, he told me if he doesn't have a temperature and as long as i wrap him up warm its fine.

You could consider using something like a rain fly to block the wind and proceed as usual.<br>  <br>  The below article found by googling "cold air colds" Gives studies supporting the theory that cold air does not cause colds and also goes through the effect of cold air on a person with a cold.<br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_55.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_55.html</a>
AA10381258	It seems like there is some sort of time line we don't know about where sleep gets difficult at 24 weeks. Grab some extra pillows, use some benadryl to help make you extra sleepy (yes, its completely safe during pregnancy) or Tylenol PM if you are achy too. In a week or two, sleep will become more comfortable again for a while. It did for me anyway. Up until now. 33 weeks. Good luck.|`|PCxDTT0paa	I'm 24wks as well and have been noticing a change in sleep habits. I can sleep just fine one night and the next I can't get comfy or the baby is continuously moving. The baby is OK..just growing a whole lot faster now than he has been. Just think-we are over half way there!<br>  Congrats!|`|hbuwryL9aa	of course your baby is ok. sleeping problems are normal. if you cant sleep, that might mean signs that your baby is restless, or that you are almost near labor.
Xs0fhFJnaa	take a test
si770wyhaa	You have to wait almost until your next period. Many test thease days can be taken up to five days before your period is expected, but are less likely to be accurate than on the day you are supposed to get your period. I'd get one of thease tests, the best I've tried so far is Clear Blue Digital tests, they're about 10 dollars for a pack of three at Walmart and say Pregnant or Not Pregnant so there is no confusion. Take one five days before your next period is due. Then if it's negitive take one the day your period is due just to be sure, or maybe even wait a few days after its due if it doesn't come. Good Luck, hope you get the results you want.|`|3F8XBNDNaa	I've read that the absolute soonest a test can detect the HCG hormone in urine is 12 days after conception. The most reliable time obviously is after your first missed period. The First Response pregnancy test can detect the hormone in over 60% of pregnant women 6 days before their period's due. If negative but you suspect you are then repeat test a week or two later.

There are plenty of people out there who have gotten pregnant and had to live on their own, or with their parents.  If your parent has no problem with you having a baby, then it's fine.  You can also get on Financial Services to support the baby, just ask your parents or do some research.  If your job does not cover it, that is where Child Support comes into play.  Also make sure that your guyfriend is there to support you every step of the way, and to always be there when you need it most.  If you both trust each other and really love each other, then the relationship will last :3  <br>  Good luck.  But who knows?  Maybe you aren't pregnant, and all of this can be avoided.  There are abortion options out there too xD  At least if your moral values and beliefs don't mind this concept.|`|79eRDIbXaa	You be fine Honey, it can work out.<br>  Get your self a Doctors appointment booked and go from there.<br>  Good Luck xx|`|mCDopsLEaa	I definately managed to support my child (and then two, so children) while being in college, living with one parent and a relationship on the rocks. I got pregnant at 16. I had a family member watch my little one and I returned to school within one week of having my baby. So I graduated, went to the University of South Carolina (go gamecocks) I got pregnant again while in college and NOW, I'm 22 with a 5 year old and a 2 year old,  me and my kids dad are back together after 4 years of separation, have a nice new car, an amazing home, an excellent job at one of the finest law firms in my area and a fantastic relationship. I'll put it to you this way, if you are pregnant, you better grow up quick because its not just about you anymore. Don't be a statistic either. Don't be a drop out. I did get government support for the first few years of my oldest as far as the financials are concerned and it really helped out a lot. But once you get on your feet you are going to look back and realize all the hard work you did really paid off. If you aren't pregnant, take it as a lesson learned and get some protection and birthcontrol.

I don't know any treatments to decide the babies sex though..|`|ibg67Xtvaa	Gender Selection for Family Balancing<br>  Definition<br>  The process of gender selection increases the chance of having a female or male child, by separating sperm that bear the X chromosome (female) and those that have the Y chromosome (male), and inseminating with whichever sample is desired. <br>  <br>  Indications<br>  The procedure can be employed for couples who want a child of a specific gender. It is otherwise known as family balancing.<br>  <br>  OPTION #1 : SPERM SELECTION <br>  This technique for alteration of the "chances" that a pregnancy of a selected gender will occur involves the physical separation of sperm. The human sperm cell is the gamete responsible for the determination of the sex of a resulting pregnancy. <br>  <br>  One half of the sperm normally produced by a healthy male will carry the Y-chromosome producing a male baby and the other half of the sperm (X-chromosome) will produce a female. By altering the number of sperm of each sex present in a semen sample, the ratio of the sperm for each sex may be altered, with an attendant change in the chance that a given sex will occur in the resulting pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Read More <br>  <br>  OPTION #2 : IVF/PGD <br>  Employing embryo biopsy, couples undertaking in vitro fertilization (IVF) are afforded the opportunity of knowing the gender of each embryo prior to the decision concerning which embryos shall be returned to the womb via embryo transfer and which shall be safely stored for a later date. Clearly, if we are aware of the sex of an embryo while it remains still in our care, measures can be taken to assure that only embryos of a selected gender are returned to the womb for the possible establishment of pregnancy. In vitro fertilization with PGD is the only procedure where success rates are higher than 99.9%. <br>  <br>  Read More <br>  <br>  Success Rate<br>  Our success rate via gender selection using the sedimentation method is approximately 80% for male selection and 72% for female selection. The success rate for gender selection using the IVF/PGD method is 100% for male or for female selection.<br>  <br>   PGD<br>  Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis<br>  Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) involves proven and adequately tested Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) which are quite safe, reliable and ethically acceptable. In-vitro fertilization is now widely adopted and it is used as the basis of all of our gender selection programs. <br>  <br>  Who can benefit from PGD?<br>  Either one of a couple carrying a single gene defect, by testing for specific genetic disorders<br>  Women aged 35+, by testing for age-related chromosomal disorders <br>  Younger women with repeated unexplained miscarriages, by testing for chromosomal disorders<br>  Couples wanting to balance their family.<br>  <br>  What is PGD?<br>  Two days after fertilisation, embryos consist of eight cells and are the size of this full stop. Science is now so advanced, that at this stage is it possible to safely remove a single cell, analyse it for a range of gender-specific chromosomal disorders and ensure only unaffected embryos are implanted in the womb. This specialist technique is called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD).<br>  <br>  A single cell, carrying material used to support the foetus's development, is removed from the embryo and its chromosome structure is analysed in carefully controlled laboratory conditions, with the X and Y chromosomes clearly distinguishable. The removal of a single cell does not damage the embryo's development in any way, and each embryo will continue to grow normally. <br>  <br>  Why PGD?<br>  Babies born with chromosome abnormalities occur in <br>  1 in 1,000 births in women aged 30 or younger<br>  1 in 350 births by 35<br>  1 in 100 births by 40 <br>  and ultimately 1 in 25 births by 45. <br>  <br>  The purpose of PGD is to select only healthy embryos (for the chromosomes we can so far test for) for implantation in the hope of achieving more pregnancies, less spontaneous miscarriages and less affected offspring.<br>  <br>  IVF requires timing. This timing is often unique to the individual cycle. This example is just to provide you an idea of what a typical IVF cycle may entail. Frequently, oral contraceptives are used for 3-6 weeks prior to beginning Lupron therapy. Lupron therapy typically starts 2 weeks prior to your first gonadotropin (Gonal-f) injection. <br>  Day Primary Event Tests Medications <br>  1 Menses   Leuprolide Acetate<br>  (past two weeks)  <br>  2 Menses FSH, LH, E2, US Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  3 Menses   Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  4 Menses   Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  5 Menses   Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  6 Maturing follicles E2, US, LH Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  7 Maturing follicles   Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  8 Maturing follicles E2, US, LH Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  9 Maturing follicles   Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  10 Maturing follicles E2, US, LH Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  11 Maturing follicles E2, US, LH Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  12 Maturing follicles E2, US, LH Gonal-f or Follimon  <br>  13 Mature follicles E2, US, LH hCG (LG IVF-C)  <br>  14 Retrieval Fertilization Progesterone <br>  15 Freeze Embryos   Progesterone <br>  16 Transfe|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Not very well.

But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.<br>  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.<br>  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most men with fertility problems have no signs or symptoms. Some men with hormonal problems may note a change in their voice or pattern of hair growth, enlargement of their breasts, or difficulty with sexual function. Infertility in women may be signaled by irregular menstrual periods or associated with conditions that cause pain during menstruation or intercourse.<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  The human reproductive process is complex. To accomplish a pregnancy, the intricate processes of ovulation and fertilization need to work just right. For many couples attempting pregnancy, something goes wrong in one or both of these complex processes and causes infertility. Because of the intricate series of events required to begin a pregnancy, many factors may cause a delay in starting your family.<br>  Every month the pituitary gland in a woman's brain sends a signal to her ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation. The pituitary hormones — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) — are involved in stimulating the ovaries to bring an egg to ovulation. A large boost in LH carries a message to the ovarian follicle to release its egg (ovulate). A woman is most fertile at the time of ovulation — around day 14 of her menstrual cycle — although the exact time of ovulation varies among women due to different lengths of menstrual cycles.<br>  The egg is then captured by a fallopian tube and is viable for about 24 hours, but its best chance of being fertilized is within the first 12 hours following ovulation. For pregnancy to occur, a sperm must unite with the egg in the fallopian tube during this time. Sperm are capable of fertilizing the egg for up to 72 hours and must be present in the fallopian tube at the same time as the egg for conception to occur. If fertilized, the egg moves into the uterus two to four days later. There it attaches to the uterine lining and begins a nine-month process of growth.<br>  In order for a sperm to reach an egg, many factors are involved in the male fertility process. There must be enough sperm, they must be of the right shape and they must move in the right way. There must be enough semen to transport the sperm. The man also needs to be able to have an erection, and must be able to ejaculate the semen and deliver it into the vagina.<br>  The cause or causes of infertility can involve one or both partners. For many couples having problems with fertility, the male partner is either the sole or a contributing cause. Problems with female fertility are common as well, but present less often than those in the male partner. In both men and women, multiple factors can account for difficulty with fertility. Sometimes the problem isn't really one of infertility, but a more general sexual problem such as erectile dysfunction. Other times, the problem may involve an abnormality in the structure of the reproductive hormones or organs. Certain infections and diseases also can affect fertility.<br>  Causes of male infertility<br>  A number of causes exist for male infertility that may result in impaired sperm count or mobility, or impaired ability to fertilize the egg. The most common causes of male infertility include abnormal sperm production or function, impaired delivery of sperm, conditions related to a man's general health and lifestyle, and overexposure to certain environmental elements:<br>  Abnormal sperm production or function. Most cases of male infertility are due to sperm abnormalities, such as:<br>  ·Impaired shape and movement of sperm. Sperm must be properly shaped and able to move rapidly and accurately toward the egg for fertilization to occur. If the shape and structure (morphology) of the sperm are abnormal or the movement (motility) is impaired, sperm may not be able to reach the egg. <br>  ·Absent sperm production in testicles. Complete failure of the testicles to produce sperm is rare, affecting very few infertile men. <br>  ·Low sperm concentration. A normal sperm concentration is greater than or equal to 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen. A count of 10 million or fewer sperm per milliliter of semen indicates low sperm concentration (subfertility). A count of 40 million sperm or higher per milliliter of semen indicates increased fertility. <br>  ·Varicocele. A varicocele is a varicose vein in the scrotum that may prevent normal cooling of the testicle and raise testicular temperature, preventing sperm from surviving. <br>  ·Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). This occurs when one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum during fetal development. Undescended testicles can cause mild to severely impaired sperm production. Because the testicles are exposed to the higher internal body temperature compared to the temperature in the scrotum, sperm production may be affected. <br>  ·Testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism). Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves, or an abnormality affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary glands in the brain that produce the hormones that control the testicles. <br>  ·Klinefelter's syndrome. In this disorder of the sex chromosomes, a man has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y. This causes abnormal development of the testicles, resulting in low or absent sperm production. Testosterone production also may be lower. <br>  ·Infections. Infection may temporarily affect sperm motility. Repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are most often associated with male infertility. These infections can cause scarring and block sperm passage. Mycoplasma is an organism that may fasten itself to sperm cells, making them less motile. If mumps, a viral infection usually affecting young children, occurs after puberty, inflammation of the testicles can impair sperm production. Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), urethra or epididymis also may alter sperm motility. <br>  In many instances, no cause for reduced sperm production is found. When sperm concentration is less than 5 million per milliliter of semen, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome.<br>  Impaired delivery of sperm. Problems with the delivery of sperm from the penis into the vagina can cause infertility. These may include:<br>  ·Sexual issues. Often treatable, problems with sexual intercourse or technique may affect fertility. Difficulties with erection of the penis (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), or psychological or relationship problems can contribute to infertility. Use of lubricants such as oils or petroleum jelly can be toxic to sperm and impair fertility. <br>  ·Retrograde ejaculation. This occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm rather than emerging out through the penis. Various conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation including diabetes, bladder, prostate or urethral surgery, and the use of psychiatric or antihypertensive drugs. <br>  ·Blockage of epididymis or ejaculatory ducts. Some men are born with blockage of the part of the testicle that contains sperm (epididymis) or ejaculatory ducts. And some men who seek treatment for infertility lack the tubes that carry sperm (vasa deferentia). <br>  ·No semen (ejaculate). The absence of ejaculate may occur in men with spinal cord injuries or diseases. This fluid transports sperm through the penis into the vagina. <br>  ·Misplaced urinary opening (hypospadias). A birth defect can cause the urinary (urethral) opening to be abnormally located on the underside of the penis. If not surgically corrected, this condition can prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. <br>  ·Anti-sperm antibodies. Antibodies that target sperm and weaken or disable them usually occur after surgical blockage of part of the vas deferens for male sterilization (vasectomy). Presence of these antibodies may complicate the reversal of a vasectomy. <br>  ·Cystic fibrosis. Men with cystic fibrosis often have missing or obstructed vasa deferentia. <br>  General health and lifestyle. A man's general health and lifestyle may affect fertility. Some common causes of infertility related to health and lifestyle include:<br>  ·Emotional stress. Stress may interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Your sperm count may be affected if you experience excessive or prolonged emotional stress. A problem with fertility itself can sometimes become long term and discouraging, producing more stress. Infertility can affect social relationships and sexual functioning. <br>  ·Malnutrition. Deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc and folate may contribute to infertility. <br>  ·Obesity. Increased body mass may be associated with fertility problems in men. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Both radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can impair sperm production, sometimes severely. The closer radiation treatment is to the testicles, the higher the risk of infertility. Removal of one or both testicles due to cancer also may affect male fertility. You may want to consider freezing (cryopreserving) your sperm before cancer treatment to ensure future fertility. <br>  ·Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol or drug dependency can be associated with general ill health and reduced fertility. The use of certain drugs also can contribute to infertility. Anabolic steroids, for example, which are taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth, can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. A severe injury or major surgery can affect male fertility. Certain diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, HIV/AIDS, Cushing's syndrome, anemia, heart attack, and liver or kidney failure, may be associated with infertility. <br>  ·Age. A gradual decline in fertility is common in men older than 35. <br>  Environmental exposure. Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm count either directly by affecting testicular function or indirectly by altering the male hormonal system. Specific causes include:<br>  ·Pesticides and other chemicals. Herbicides and insecticides may cause female hormone-like effects in the male body and may be associated with reduced sperm production. Exposure to such chemicals also may contribute to testicular cancer. Men exposed to hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, xylen and aromatic solvents used in paint, varnishes, glues, metal degreasers and other products, may be at risk of infertility. Men with high exposure to lead also may be more at risk. <br>  ·Testicular exposure to overheating. Frequent use of saunas or hot tubs can elevate your core body temperature. This may impair your sperm production and lower your sperm count. <br>  ·Substance abuse. Cocaine or heavy marijuana use may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. <br>  Causes of female infertility<br>  The most common causes of female infertility include fallopian tube damage or blockage, endometriosis, ovulation disorders, elevated prolactin, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause, benign uterine fibroids and pelvic adhesions:<br>  Fallopian tube damage or blockage. This condition usually results from inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis). Chlamydia is the most frequent cause. Tubal inflammation may go unnoticed or cause pain and fever.<br>  Tubal damage with scarring is the major risk factor of a pregnancy in which the fertilized egg is unable to make its way through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). One episode of tubal infection may cause fertility difficulties. The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with each occurrence of tubal infection.<br>  Endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that makes up the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This tissue most commonly is implanted on the ovaries or the lining of the abdomen near the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. These implants respond to the hormonal cycle and grow, shed and bleed in sync with the lining of the uterus each month, which can lead to scarring and inflammation. Pelvic pain and infertility are common in women with endometriosis.<br>  Infertility in endometriosis also may be due to:<br>  ·Ovarian cysts (endometriomas). Ovarian cysts may indicate advanced endometriosis and often are associated with reduced fertility. Endometriomas can be treated with surgery. <br>  ·Scar tissue. Endometriosis may cause rigid webs of scar tissue between the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. This may prevent the transfer of the egg to the fallopian tube. <br>  Ovulation disorders. Some cases of female infertility are caused by ovulation disorders. Disruption in the part of the brain that regulates ovulation (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) can cause deficiencies in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Even slight irregularities in the hormone system can affect ovulation.<br>  Specific causes of hypothalamic-pituitary disorders include:<br>  ·Direct injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland <br>  ·Pituitary tumors <br>  ·Excessive exercise <br>  ·Anorexia nervosa <br>  Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia). The hormone prolactin stimulates breast milk production. High levels in women who aren't pregnant or nursing may affect ovulation. An elevation in prolactin levels may also indicate the presence of a pituitary tumor. In addition, some drugs can elevate levels of prolactin. Milk flow not related to pregnancy or nursing (galactorrhea) can be a sign of high prolactin.<br>  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An increase in androgen hormone production causes PCOS. In women with increased body mass, elevated androgen production may come from stimulation by higher levels of insulin. In lean women, the elevated levels of androgen may be stimulated by a higher ratio of luteinizing hormone (LH). Lack of menstruation (amenorrhea) or infrequent menses (oligomenorrhea) are common symptoms in women with PCOS.<br>  In PCOS, increased androgen production prevents the follicles of the ovaries from producing a mature egg. Small follicles that start to grow but can't mature to ovulation remain within the ovary. A persistent lack of ovulation may lead to mild enlargement of the ovaries.<br>  Without ovulation, the hormone progesterone isn't produced and estrogen levels remain constant. Elevated levels of androgen may cause increased dark or thick hair on the chin, upper lip or lower abdomen as well as acne and oily skin.<br>  Early menopause (premature ovarian failure). Early menopause is the absence of menstruation and the early depletion of ovarian follicles before age 35. Although the cause is often unknown, certain conditions are associated with early menopause, including:<br>  ·Autoimmune disease. The body produces antibodies to attack its own tissue, in this case the ovary. This may be associated with hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). <br>  ·Radiation or chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. <br>  Benign uterine fibroids.Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s. Occasionally they may cause infertility by interfering with the contour of the uterine cavity, blocking the fallopian tubes.<br>  Pelvic adhesions. Pelvic adhesions are bands of scar tissue that bind organs after pelvic infection, appendicitis, or abdominal or pelvic surgery. They may limit the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and impair fertility. Scar tissue formation inside the uterine cavity after a surgical procedure may result in a closed uterus and ceased menstruation (Asherman's syndrome). This is most common following surgery to control uterine bleeding after giving birth.<br>  Other causes. A number of other causes can lead to infertility in women:<br>  ·Medications. Temporary infertility may occur with the use of certain medications. In most cases, fertility is restored when the medication is stopped. <br>  ·Thyroid problems. Disorders of the thyroid gland, either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism), can interrupt the menstrual cycle and cause infertility. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Certain cancers — particularly female reproductive cancers — often severely impair female fertility. Both radiation and chemotherapy may affect a woman's ability to reproduce. Chemotherapy may impair reproductive function and fertility more severely in men than in women. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. Medical conditions associated with delayed puberty or amenorrhea, such as Cushing's disease, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease and diabetes, can affect a woman's fertility. <br>  Risk factors<br>  Many of the risk factors for both male and female infertility are the same. They include:<br>  ·Age. Age is the strongest predictor of female fertility. After about age 32, a woman's fertility potential gradually declines. A woman does not renew her oocytes (eggs). Infertility in older women may be due to a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities that occur in the eggs as they age. Older women are also more likely to have health problems that may interfere with fertility. The risk of miscarriage also increases with a woman's age. A gradual decline in fertility is possible in men older than 35. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Women who smoke tobacco may reduce their chances of becoming pregnant and the possible benefit of fertility treatment. Miscarriages are more frequent in women who smoke. <br>  ·Alcohol. There's no certain level of safe alcohol use during conception or pregnancy. <br>  ·Body mass. Extremes in body mass — either too high (body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 25.0) or too low (BMI of lower than 20.0) — may affect ovulation and increase the risk of infertility. <br>  ·Being overweight. Among American women, infertility often is due to a sedentary lifestyle and being overweight. <br>  ·Being underweight. Women at risk include those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, and women following a very low-calorie or restrictive diet. Strict vegetarians also may experience infertility problems due to a lack of important nutrients such as vitamin B-12, zinc, iron and folic acid. Marathon runners, dancers and others who exercise very intensely are more prone to menstrual irregularities and infertility. <br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  In general, don't be concerned about infertility unless you and your partner have been trying regularly to conceive for at least one year. However, if you plan to conceive and you're a woman older than 30 or haven't had a menstrual flow for longer than six months, seek a medical evaluation. If you have a history of irregular or painful menstrual cycles, pelvic pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or repeated miscarriages, schedule a consultation with your doctor sooner. If you're a man with a low sperm count or a history of testicular, prostate or sexual problems, consider seeking help earlier.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  If you and your partner are unable to achieve conception within a reasonable time and would like to do so, seek help. The woman's gynecologist, the man's urologist or your family doctor can determine whether there's a problem that requires a specialist or clinic that treats infertility problems.<br>  Some infertile couples have more than one cause of their infertility. Thus, your doctor will usually begin a comprehensive infertility examination of both you and your partner.<br>  Before undergoing infertility testing, be aware that a certain amount of commitment is required. Your doctor or clinic will need to determine what your sexual habits are and may make recommendations about how you may need to change those habits. The tests and periods of trial and error may extend over several months.<br>  Evaluation is expensive and in some cases involves operations and uncomfortable procedures, and the expenses may not be reimbursed by many medical plans. Finally, there's no guarantee, even after all testing and counseling, that conception will occur. However, for couples who are eager to have their own child, such an evaluation is best. It may result in a successful pregnancy.<br>  Tests for men<br>  For a man to be fertile, the testicles must produce enough healthy sperm, and the sperm must be ejaculated effectively into the woman's vagina. Tests for male infertility attempt to determine whether any of these processes are impaired.<br>  ·General physical examination. This includes examination of your genitals and questions concerning your medical history, illnesses and disabilities, medications and sexual habits. <br>  ·Semen analysis. Your doctor may ask for a specimen of ejaculated semen. This is generally obtained by masturbating or by interrupting intercourse and ejaculating your semen into a clean container. Your doctor will provide instructions. Such a specimen may be required more than once. A laboratory analyzes your semen specimen for quantity, color and presence of infections or blood. Detailed analysis of the sperm also is done. The laboratory will determine the number of sperm present and any abnormalities in the shape and movement (motility) of the sperm. Often sperm counts fluctuate from one specimen to the next. <br>  ·Hormone testing. A blood test to determine the level of testosterone and other male hormones is common. <br>  Tests for women<br>  For a woman to be fertile, the ovaries must release healthy eggs regularly, and her reproductive tract must allow the eggs and sperm to pass into her fallopian tubes for a possible union. Her reproductive organs must be healthy and functional.<br>  After your doctor asks questions regarding your health history, menstrual cycle and sexual habits, you'll undergo a general physical examination. This includes a regular gynecologic examination. Specific fertility tests may include:<br>  ·Confirmation of ovulation. A blood test is sometimes performed to determine the levels of hormones involved in successful ovulation. <br>  ·Hysterosalpingography. This test evaluates the condition of your uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluid is injected into your uterus, and an X-ray is taken to determine whether the fluid progresses out of the uterus and into your fallopian tubes and general peritoneal cavity. Blockage or problems often can be located and may be corrected with medication or surgery. <br>  ·Laparoscopy. Performed under general anesthesia, this surgical procedure involves inserting a thin viewing device into your abdomen and pelvis to examine your fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus. A small incision (8 to 10 millimeters) is made beneath your navel, and a needle is inserted into your abdominal cavity. A small amount of gas (usually carbon dioxide) is inserted into the abdomen to create space for entry of the laparoscope — an illuminated, fiber-optic telescope. <br>  The most common problems identified by laparoscopy are endometriosis and scarring. Your doctor can also detect blockages or irregularities of the fallopian tubes and uterus. Often a blue dye is injected into the cervical canal and through the uterus and fallopian tubes to determine whether they are open. At the end of the procedure, the gas and laparoscope are drawn out and the incision is closed. Laparoscopy generally is done on an outpatient basis.<br>  ·Basal body temperature. Although this test was once a standard, basal body temperature charting is used less often today. Charting a woman's body temperature doesn't give as precise time of ovulation as earlier believed. <br>  ·Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) detector kits. A number of at-home kits are available to test your LH level. Although these kits may be helpful, they also can be inaccurate and misleading. Consult your doctor before using one. <br>  ·Ovarian reserve testing. Testing may be done to determine the potential effectiveness of the eggs after ovulation. This approach often begins with hormone testing early in a woman's menstrual cycle. <br>  Not everyone needs to undergo all, or even many, of these tests before the cause of infertility is found. Which tests are used and their sequence depend on discussion and agreement between you and your doctor.<br>  Unexplained infertility<br>  In some infertile couples, no specific cause is found (unexplained infertility). Couples receiving the diagnosis of unexplained infertility are more likely to seek multiple health care providers and be influenced by the experiences of family and friends or literature that promises new hope. Although infertility is unexplained, the pregnancy rate for these couples is among the highest.<br>  Complications<br>  Complications of being infertile often involve strong emotions and may trigger negative feelings between you and your partner. These may include:<br>  ·Depression <br>  ·Guilt <br>  ·Anger <br>  ·Stress <br>  ·Disappointment <br>  ·Resentment <br>  ·Blame <br>  ·Fear of losing partner because of infertility <br>  ·Diminished confidence and self-esteem <br>  Treatment <br>  Treatment of infertility depends on the cause, the duration of the problem, the age of the partners and their specific wishes. Some causes of infertility can't be corrected. However, various means of insemination or embryo transfer may be possible so that a woman can still become pregnant.<br>  Nonsurgical fertility treatment falls into two main categories:<br>  ·Restoring or bringing about fertility <br>  ·Assisted reproductive technology (ART) <br>  Restoring or bringing about fertility<br>  These approaches can involve steps related to the male or to the female, or both.<br>  Sperm survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 72 hours, and an egg can be fertilized for up to 24 hours after ovulation. Increasing the frequency of intercourse increases the chances for conception.<br>  Other approaches that involve the male include:<br>  ·Treatment of general sexual problems. Addressing impotence or premature ejaculation can improve fertility. Treatment for these problems often is with medication or behavioral approaches. <br>  ·Addressing lack of sperm. When the source of infertility lies in the man's sperm, or lack of it, restoring or initiating fertility is sometimes possible. For example, in some instances, surgical correction of a varicocele will restore fertility. Problems with the testicles, prostate gland, seminal vesicle and urethra also can be treated. When sperm production is impaired because of damage to the sperm-producing areas of the testicle, drug treatment has little benefit. In rare instances when sperm production is impaired because of a pituitary problem, treatment with pituitary hormones called gonadotropins may help. When infection hampers sperm production, both you and your partner will need treatment. <br>  Fertility drugs (ovulation induction)<br>  Fertility drugs are the primary treatment for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. These medications regulate or induce ovulation. In general, they exert actions designed to work like natural follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Commonly used fertility drugs include:<br>  ·Clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene). This drug is taken orally and stimulates ovulation in women who have PCOS or other ovulatory disorders. It causes the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, which stimulate the growth of an ovarian follicle containing an egg. <br>  ·Human menopausal gonadotropin, or hMG (Repronex, Pergonal). This injected prescription medication is for women who don't menstruate on their own due to the failure of the pituitary gland to stimulate ovulation. Unlike clomiphene, which stimulates the pituitary gland, hMG and other gonadotropins directly stimulate the ovaries. This drug contains both FSH and LH. <br>  ·Follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH (Gonal-F, Follistim, Bravelle). FSH is essentially hMG without the LH. Like hMG, it works by stimulating the ovaries to mature egg follicles. <br>  ·Human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG (Ovidrel, Pregnyl). Used in combination with clomiphene, hMG and FSH, this drug stimulates the follicle to release its egg (ovulate). <br>  ·Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs. This treatment is for women with irregular ovulatory cycles or who ovulate prematurely — before the lead follicle is mature enough — during hMG treatment. Gn-RH analogs deliver constant Gn-RH to the pituitary gland, which alters hormone production, so that a physician can induce follicle growth with FSH. <br>  ·Letrozole (Femara). This drug is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors, which are approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Doctors sometimes prescribe letrozole for women who don't ovulate on their own and who haven't responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Letrozole is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for inducing ovulation. The drug's manufacturer has warned doctors not to use the drug for fertility purposes because of possible adverse health effects. These adverse effects may include birth defects and miscarriage. <br>  ·Metformin (Glucophage). This oral drug is taken to boost ovulation. It's used when insulin resistance is known or suspected. <br>  ·Bromocriptine. This medication is for women whose ovulation cycles are irregular due to elevated levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production in new mothers. Bromocriptine inhibits prolactin production. <br>  Injectable fertility drugs significantly increase the chance of multiple births. The use of these drugs requires careful monitoring with a combination of blood tests of hormones and ultrasound measurement of ovarian follicle size. Generally, the greater the number of fetuses, the higher the risk of premature labor. Babies born prematurely are at increased risk of health and developmental problems. The risk is greater for triplets than it is for twins or single pregnancies.<br>  The risk of multiple pregnancies can be reduced. If a woman requires an hCG injection to trigger ovulation, and ultrasound exams show that too many follicles have developed, she and her doctor can decide to withhold the hCG injection. For many couples, however, the desire to become pregnant overrides concerns about conceiving multiple babies.<br>  When too many babies are conceived, removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) can offer improved survival odds for the surviving fetuses. This presents serious emotional and ethical challenges for many people. If you and your partner are considering fertility drug treatment, discuss this possibility with your doctor before starting treatment.<br>  There may be a link between fertility drugs and an increased, long-term risk of ovarian cancer. However, the association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer hasn't been confirmed.<br>  Surgery<br>  Depending on the cause, surgery may be a treatment option for infertility. Blockages or other problems in the fallopian tubes usually can be surgically repaired. Laparoscopy allows delicate operations on the fallopian tubes.<br>  Infertility due to endometriosis often is more difficult to treat. Although hormones such as those found in birth control pills are effective for treating endometriosis and relieving pain, they haven't been useful in treating infertility. If you have endometriosis, your doctor may treat you with ovulation therapy, in which medication is used to stimulate or regulate ovulation, or in vitro fertilization, in which the egg and sperm are joined in the laboratory and transferred to the uterus.<br>  Assisted reproductive technology (ART)<br>  ART has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. Each year thousands of babies are born in the United States as a result of ART. Medical advances have enabled many couples to have their own biological child. An ART health team includes physicians, psychologists, embryologists, laboratory technicians, nurses and allied health professionals who work together to help infertile couples achieve pregnancy.<br>  The most common forms of ART include:<br>  ·In vitro fertilization (IVF). This is the most effective ART technique. IVF involves retrieving mature eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a dish in a laboratory and implanting the embryos in the uterus three to five days after fertilization. IVF often is recommended as a first-line therapy and is the treatment of choice if both fallopian tubes are blocked. It's also widely used for a number of other conditions, such as endometriosis, unexplained infertility, cervical factor infertility, male factor infertility and ovulation disorders. <br>  ·Electroejaculation. Electric stimulus brings about ejaculation to obtain semen. This procedure can be used in men with a spinal cord injury who can't otherwise achieve ejaculation. <br>  ·Surgical sperm aspiration. This technique involves removing sperm from part of the male reproductive tract such as the epididymis, vas deferens or testicle. This allows retrieval of sperm if blockage is present. <br>  ·Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This technique consists of a microscopic technique (micromanipulation) in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to achieve fertilization in conjunction with the standard IVF procedure. ICSI has been especially helpful in couples who have previously failed to achieve conception with standard techniques. For men with low sperm concentrations, ICSI dramatically improves the likelihood of fertilization. <br>  ·Assisted hatching. This technique attempts to assist the implantation of the embryo into the lining of the uterus. <br>  ART works best when the woman has a healthy uterus, responds well to fertility drugs, and ovulates naturally or uses donor eggs. The man should have healthy sperm, or donor sperm should be available. The success rate of ART gradually diminishes after age 32.<br>  Complications of treatment<br>  Certain complications exist with the treatment of infertility. These include:<br>  ·Multiple pregnancy. Although the most common complication of ART is multiple pregnancy, ART isn't the direct cause of a number of the extreme cases of septuplets or octuplets reported in the media. The number of quality embryos kept and matured to fetuses and birth ultimately is a decision made by the couple. If too many babies are conceived, the removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) is possible to improve survival odds for the other fetuses. <br>  ·Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If overstimulated, a woman's ovaries may enlarge and cause pain and bloating. Mild to moderate symptoms often resolve without treatment, although pregnancy may delay recovery. Rarely, fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity and chest, causing abdominal swelling and shortness of breath. This accumulation of fluid can deplete blood volume and lower blood pressure. Severe cases require emergency treatment. Younger women and those who have polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher risk of developing OHSS than do other women. <br>  ·Bleeding or infection. As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of bleeding or infection. <br>  ·Low birth weight. The greatest risk for low birth weight is a multiple pregnancy. In single live births, there may be a greater chance of low birth weight associated with ART. <br>  ·Birth defects. Significant concern exists regarding the possible relationship between ART and birth defects. More research is necessary to confirm these findings. Weigh this factor if you're considering whether to take advantage of this treatment. ART is the most successful fertility-enhancing therapy to date. <br>  Prevention<br>  Most types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, avoid drug and tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption, which may contribute to male infertility. Also, high temperatures can affect sperm production and motility. Although this effect is usually temporary, avoid hot tubs and steam baths.<br>  If you're a man who's uncertain about whether you would eventually like to become a father, don't undergo permanent sterilization, such as a vasectomy. Although surgery to reverse this condition is possible, risks are involved that could affect fertility in other ways.<br>  A woman can increase her chances of becoming pregnant in a number of ways:<br>  ·Exercise moderately. Regular exercise is important, but if you're exercising so intensely that your periods are infrequent or absent, your fertility is likely to be impaired. <br>  ·Avoid weight extremes. Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormone production and cause infertility. <br>  ·Avoid alcohol, tobacco and street drugs. These substances may impair your ability to conceive or produce a healthy child. Don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Avoid illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. <br>  ·Limit medications. The use of both prescription and nonprescription drugs can decrease your chance of getting pregnant or keeping a pregnancy. Talk with your doctor about any medications you take regularly. <br>  Coping skills<br>  Coping with infertility can be difficult. It's an issue of the unknown — you can't predict how long it will last or what the outcome will be. Infertility isn't necessarily solved with hard work. The emotional burden on a couple is considerable, and plans for coping can help.<br>  Planning for emotional turmoil<br>  ·Set limits. Decide in advance how many and what kind of procedures are emotionally and financially acceptable for you and your partner and attempt to determine a final limit. Fertility treatments may be expensive and often not covered by insurance companies, and a successful pregnancy often depends on repeated attempts. Some couples become so focused on treatment that they continue with fertility procedures until they are emotionally and financially drained. <br>  ·Consider other options. Determine alternatives — adoption, donor sperm or egg, or even having no children — as early as possible in the fertility process. This can reduce anxiety during treatments and feelings of hopelessness if conception doesn't occur. <br>  ·Talk about your feelings. Locate support groups or counseling services for help before and after treatment to help endure the process and ease the grief should treatment fail. <br>  Managing emotional stress during treatment<br>  ·Acupuncture. This ancient therapy may benefit couples who are undergoing fertility treatment. <br>  ·Practice relaxation. Cognitive behavior therapy, which uses methods that include relaxation training and stress management, has been associated with higher pregnancy rates. <br>  ·Express yourself. Reach out to others rather than repressing guilt or anger. <br>  ·Stay in touch with loved ones. Talking to your partner, family and friends can be very beneficial. The best support often comes from loved ones and those closest to you. <br>  Managing emotional effects of the outcome<br>  ·Failure. The emotional stress of failure can be devastating even on the most loving and affectionate relationships and for people who've prepared well for the possibility of failure. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if the emotional burdens become too heavy for you or your partner. <br>  ·Success. Some studies have indicated that even if fertility treatment is successful, women experience increased stress and fear of failure during pregnancy. Other research suggests that women who achieved pregnancy using fertility treatments felt increasingly better and had higher self-esteem and less anxiety as the pregnancy progressed than did women whose pregnancies didn't involve medical intervention. <br>  ·Multiple births. A successful pregnancy that results in multiple births introduces new complexities and emotional problems. The risk of depression is higher in women who have multiple births. <br>  ·Parenting. Once a child arrives, parents are more likely to be more anxious and have less confidence and self-esteem. Discuss becoming parents with your partner and plan for the many changes — challenging and rewarding — that a child will bring to your lives. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  By Mayo Clinic Staff <br>  Jun 15, 2006 <br>  ? 1998-2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Have you told your husband about what is happening?  It maybe time for a family sit down meeting.  Be forewarned that he (the 15 yr old) will have somethings to say that may not be so nice.

I had cramps when i was at the begining of my pregnancy. That's totally normal! if you have any questions though i would ask your doctor. they would know more then anyone on here!|`|AA11210405	If you have aches in your lower abdomen that feel like muscles stretching then you should be fine.  If you have severe cramping - and of course any bleeding - then get tot he Dr.  The muscle aches are just your uterus and muscles making room for baby..and believe me they only get worse!  I am at 29 weeks today. Go get a book called " what to expect when you are expecting" by Heidi Murkoff.  It's the pregnancy bible and will help with all these questions. I refer to it almost daily right now and I am due Feb 2, 2007.  Your question as well as many others that you would not expect is in there.  It's excellent in describing all of these little things that worry moms and help distinguish when something is "normal" or not. <br>  Good Luck!|`|18171455e1e9c50619fc48a4e5dacd8aaa	I have a funny story about this actually. I asked my nurse about the same pains and she looked at me all stern and said "Hun, your pregnant." I started cracking up laughing and so did she. She said that muscles are stretching and that is what causes the pain. Even down in the privates. If you are worried though have a talk with your doctor. Good luck!|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	Cramping is normal as long as it is not severe and accompanied by bleeding.  Everything is growing and stretching.  Your body is changing and making room for a little baby.  Just because you miscarried before, it does not make you at higher risk for miscarrying again.  Try to relax,  it is not good for your baby if you are stressed.  I know it is hard but so far everything you are experiencing is normal and I am sure that because you lost your first, your doctor will be keeping a close eye on this pregnancy.<br>  Good Luck!

99818a2b3f91b1def1e1e02ed674aedaaa	She is probably just trying to figure things out.  Falling may not have hurt her, but it could've scared her.  One question...is she a "perfectionist?"  My daughter liked to get things right before she did stuff.  For example.  When she was learning to walk, she'd take a couple steps.  When she would fall it'd be a while before she'd try again.  I could tell she was watching what we were doing to see why we didn't fall and then she'd mimic us.  Or for talking...she'd literally whisper words to herself until she could say them right then she'd say them out loud.  Not before b/c she had to say them correctly.  Maybe that's why your daughter isn't walking...<br>  <br>  Then again, some kids do things like that.  They start to crawl, then they don't for a while. They start to talk, then they stop for a while.  Same thing with walking.  There's not particular reason, they just don't feel like doing it.  Just give her time.  She's not going to try NOT walking to irritate you or herself...she may just not be interested at this moment.  I'd say, give her a few more weeks and see if she does it again.  Or help her along.  <br>  <br>  With my daughter, I'd get two people sitting about 4 feet apart and let her walk in between us so if she went to fall, we'd catch her.  The reason?  We stood her up to let her walk and if we let her fall on the ground, she wouldn't trust us.  However, if she were to get up on her own then we wouldn't worry about it...she'd know that we weren't going to let her get "hurt" so she'd be more brave about walking.<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out!  Best of luck!!|`|AA12220887	My little girl is 16 months and also isn't walking.  She; however, was a preemie (two months early) and has been behind since the day she was born.   What really bothers me is when people say "where's her shoes?" when we are out in public.  You aren't supposed to put shoes on a toddler that isn't walking yet....it messes with their foot development which delays walking even more so I put tights on underneath her pants and then knee high socks over that to keep her warm in this Wisconsin weather! <br>  <br>  My daughter is enrolled in an early childhood intervention program (ask your pediatrician if this may be something that could help with your child's development as every state has one) and has a therapist come out weekly.  Just a suggestion...<br>  <br>    We have been trying to get my daughter on her feet as much as possible....put toys up on the sofa to get her to cruise....sit behind her maybe two or three feet so she has to pivot, reach and take a few steps to reach you.  Do you have any toys that your child can stand and play?  An activity table that she can cruise around perhaps?   Also, sit Indian style or with your legs at a "V" on the floor.  Place your daughter on your leg with her feet firmly on the floor.  Then, grab a toy and say "Up, Up, Up" and see if she will stand up to get it.  Keep practicing....I know how frustrating it is.  She'll get it eventually, just keep her on her feet to get her muscles and ankles well toned for walking.|`|e97fc691dc0b4ada5aca0e58e5ddb5eeaa	my son is not crawling or standing/cruising and he just turned 10 months. my daughter who is now 8 years old walked, crawled and cruised all before 1 years old but i have learned not too compare them as they are two very different indiviuials. It boggles my mind as to how  different they really are.  My doctor told me to take my son to speech development and physical therapy as he is only saying nananana and she said he should be saying mama and dada which  he will do in his own time. he is only 10 months!!!!! he will do it in his own time, just like yours will. good luck and hug your little one|`|2a8c54d91bbd399f2517e7128a26e2e8aa	nothing,her fall scared her,she`ll come around when she feels ready|`|37a8f9d1edfe8b2a215b0f67d1468990aa	My youngest son wouldnt walk for the life of me i tried everything bribing him getting down on the ground with him i did EVERYTHING but he just didnt want to walk so i just let him do it in his own time and when i stopped worrying about it he finally started walking so maybe if you just let the baby do it and stop stressing then it will happen and dont worry she will get her balance when she really starts to go <br>      GOOD LUCK|`|bed96bdc6ae09ca7dfdabec8de1ed782aa	About the best you can do is encourage her to walk towards something she wants and give her lots of praise when she does take steps. There really isn't anything you can do other than that. Kids will do things when they are ready and each one is different in their development. Don't worry about her not wanting to walk yet, she will be running in no time. Just encourage her to walk, hold her hand and walk with her when you go outside to the car, or in the store, this helps give them the idea of keeping moving to keep balance. Keep up the encouragement and don't worry or get upset if she doesn't seem to want to walk yet. If you are really concerned, then ask your pediatrician, they can tell you when to worry and then at that time determine why. Until that point, just be patient offer lots of praise and encouragement, she will run before too long. Mine did the same thing. All 3 of my children walked at different ages, my first was walking at 13mo, my middle wasn't walking until she was almost 2 and my 3rd started walking at 15mo. So it just depends on when they are ready. Best wishes.|`|AA11012951	I would talk to her pediatrician.  My child was walking at 9-10 months and the doctor told me that they should be walking by 12 months.  Perhaps this is a developmental issue your pediatrician should address.  16 months seems too old to me at least for this to be an issue.|`|b0d9c3d34beba10becbd2e4933625b3caa	Encourage her to walk, hold things out of her reach to entice her to walk to you.<br>  It takes awhile for babies to get the hang of walking. If she has the balance for it like you say, then maybe its about the confidence, she's alittle unsure of herself. Encourage her and applaud her when she does take little steps so her self confidence will build and she'll catch on easily on her own.

Also I read on a web site recently that you can have laser treatment done or microdermabration treatments after you give birth and that will get rid of them.  The only thing is though, the site said you have to get it done right away while the strech marks are still red and inflamed or it wont work and you will be stuck with them.  I don't know how much these procedures cost, but depending on how important it is to you, it doesn't hurt to look into it.  The cost may be worth it.  Good luck!  So far I don't have any.  Really hoping I don't get them either!|`|AA11783671	I also was told by my doctor they are genetic, and my mom was bad.

I used to crash diet when I was a teenager. Good news is you can treat them after. They have a stretch mark cream at wal mart or you can go to Sallys beauty supply and get a cream called Mothers Best. As long as they are pink or darker they can be treated after.

ab98b4a28898bc22389ec01cf7cba3d5aa	WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT WHILE TRYING TO HAVE A BABY?  IF ANYTHING YOU SHOULD BE TKING IN AS MANY VITAMINS AND MINERALS A SPOSSIBLE TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY AND IN TIP TOP SHAPE FOR IF YOU DO GET PREGNANT.  IF YOUR TRYING TO HAVE A BABY AND LOSE WEIGHT, I SUGGEST MAYBE YOU EXERCISE INSTEAD.  THAT WAY YOU CAN STILL EAT RIGHT, TONE AND SHAPE YOUR BODY WHILE STAYING FIT AND IN SHAPE FOR IF YOU BECOME PREGNANT.  IF YOU DO, YOU CAN STILL EXERCISE THAT WAY YOU LOSE YOUR BABY WEIGHT FASTER THAN IF YOU HADN'T EXERCISED.|`|aff24c8c1e29ed8627848e8cde47c4b4aa	start the diet after you have the baby. If you take it and you are pregnant and not know it this can cause birth defects-why take that chance.|`|b768867a0a383be57d05909789248023aa	I wouldn't take anthing while trying, especially a weight loss pill...it may make it more difficult for you to concieve, especially since you are not losing it "naturally" .  I don't even know if those pills are FDA approve.  FDA usually looks into all the effects, birth effects etc....that is what I think...but do not know for sure.|`|4b8db1b1899775292ec94f085908f865aa	I dont really think its a good idea to do so. Although, I was taking Adipex(phentermine) at the time of conception. I wasnt really actively trying to get pregnant. It just happened but I stopped taking them immediately and I am miscarrying now. So i definitely do not recommend this. You need to do one or the other. I will agree that my chances of getting pregnant increased once I made a lifestyle change. So please re-think this. Maybe loose a few lbs and then continue trying to conceive... And then when the bundle of joy arrives continue on your lifestyle change|`|5beea77eeb8d95fa6808021fc05eaf69aa	I would not recommend it. Some women may conceive and be unaware that they are actually pregnant and continue to take medications for weeks and sometime longer... If you are trying to have a baby please stop taking all unecessary drugs
e1fb375e8479e5154875d80338c91e3aaa	That's when you are supposed to use them.  First thing in the morning with your first urination.  Didn't you read the instructions?|`|9ba37d779bf6b66be00d7be317ca9bcbaa	yes they say that is the best time|`|TdBpscDxaa	I've used 3 different brands. Some tests say to use first morning urine, whilst others advise not to. You'll need to read the instructions for each individual brand. Apparently Lutenising Hormone (which the tests are designed to detect) is mostly produced after 10am in the morning so I guess that's why some tests advise waiting until later in the day?
83341f44c00d0863eafb9c7c6a1709d7aa	No...your fine and you will not harm the baby. Just watch your weight...baby weight is the hardest to lose!! Trust me...I'm still trying to lose weight from my second child...2 yrs ago! Just ask your obgyn/midwife what they think!!|`|820a73cf560f113ec7b4b70fb5270d0baa	how would that harm the baby?????? 15-20 pounds is not much and besides obese women have children all the time and the person that suffers is the mother not the fetus.|`|293fbb199a9d1cabdcbe7138e3e2de00aa	What are you worried about???  LOL fat girls get laid, fat girls get pregnant, fat girls are moms.  Surely you have seen a fat mom before?  There is nothing to worry about.|`|2a971add1ea7edc00a0806338604b84eaa	No girl it won't hurt you baby, just be careful with your eating habits, eat healthy and the Dr. will watch everything else. Good luck with you blessing.|`|AA11046288	Hardly any woman is exactly at her "proper" weight when she gets pregnant. I was about 15lbs overweight when I got pregnant with my first and I gained way too much weight because I just ate all the time. I gained about 75 lbs for a 7 lb 8 oz baby! then I never lost the weight and got pregnant with my second. By then I was about 80 lbs overweight and I only gained 16 lbs with that pregnancy and had a 9 lb baby. With my second baby, I really watched my diet and although I was eating for two, I didn't eat twice as much like I did with my first. <br>  <br>  If you are overweight, the healthy weight gain for you would be between 15 and 25 lbs. If underweight, then it would be between 35 and 45, if at ideal weight then the healthy weight to gain would be 25 to 35 lbs.<br>  <br>  No there won't be any harm to the baby, though.|`|b0656d0c9aef47575d9baaeda8b3ae37aa	It won't harm the baby.  If you were hugely obese, there would be some increased risk to the pregnancy, but even then lots of women do it without any trouble.   <br>  <br>  Given the current trend of expanding waistelines, there are tons of people getting pregnant while 20 or so pounds overweight, and while it is better not to be overweight, the risk to the pregnancy isn't enough to be worth worrying about.
1481201f989060159ef4452f48d5dfdbaa	You can always try to find another Dr that maybe would do test for you.  I am not that familiar with the strips so I can't give much advice on that.  Try tracking your symptoms may that would help you out better.  Try these sites.|`|r6WJgDoXaa	I would deffinitly look into getting a new doctor.  Also, if you do think you are ovulating and you just cant track when exactly. Just have sex three to four times a week if possible. THis way you will be sure to have sperm there waiting whenever you do ovulate. <br>  Good Luck with everything!!!|`|2FH6IuPlaa	I am having the opposite problem.  I am finding that the test strips are telling me that I am constantly ovulating.  <br>  <br>  Strange hu?!  <br>  <br>  I understand your frustration.  Just keep trying and think positive.|`|laRjvObCaa	I used ovulation strips for every morning of a two month period and never got the results that showed me to be ovulating.  So boy was I suprised -- in a very happy way! -- when I discovered that I was pregnant towards the end of the second month.  Obviously, I had ovulated -- it just never registered.  I guess that some women may not produce enough of the hormone that the test is looking for.  I think these products do work great for most women -- but every body is unique and puts out more or less of the hormones and stuff.<br>  <br>  I sympathize with your frustration.  Do know that despite your lack of a positive result, you may still be working towards pregnancy!  This is especially so if your doc confirmed you've ovulated.<br>  <br>  Something to remember -- typically, women ovulate 14 days after their period.  However, actual fertilization can come from sperm from up to 3 days before you ovulate.  My husband and I turned up the passion for the entire week (a few days before and after)  I suspected I might ovulate.  That may give you an extra shot of getting there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	You are already pregnant so he's already done his damage.  It is perfectly fine.  The baby is protected in your uterus and there id s mucous plug there to keep out infection.

a60ec65ddf7ee878a1ef93d11029706faa	Yes, it is normal, especially if it's not your 1st pregnancy. You should still see a physician to rule out pre-term labor.|`|be36029768b579ed015743f2377eca5faa	Call your doctor asap, just to make sure everything is okay, good luck.|`|2065d879020c577d272fe6db49208cdaaa	yea i think so, i got them throughout my pregnancy until i was 36 weeks and they stopped lol get checked out if you're worried|`|42bcd9f0b19eac49fc8ff52a0d21c626aa	It is normal to have true BH that early, yes.  It sounds like that's what you're having, since there's no pain or anything.  Just keep an eye out on the timing... if they're getting close togeather, coming regularly... you know the drill... then call the docs to see you right away.  Otherwise, it wouldn't hurt to mention it at the next visit, or even call and ask them to set an appt to see you a little sooner just to ease any fears if you don't go in for another month.  Best wishes!|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	Yes, I have been told that it is.  I got them very early in the pregnancy as well.  Good Luck!|`|c821a2295d5737ed8e14acb17a57461eaa	na the thing you might be feeling is the baby moving but dont realise it. its too early for them yet. it would be the baby moving probably.<br>  <br>  you have to think at 16 weeks the baby is just forming into a baby, theres no way youre having these contractions yet, but dont worry|`|AA11832247	Yes you can. I started having them about the same time with both of mind. Not trying to scare you, but mine lead me to early labor with both pregnancies and I was in the hospital at least every week to stop it. Keep an eye on it and make sure you let your ob/gyn know about it. Good luck and congats!|`|c12c23cc153fe497f84b68cf4073562baa	Sara-<br>  Mine started at 5 months, so it could be normal, but certainly it makes sense to contact your OB and discuss this.
e18359c50683b5f861495ffebde43ffdaa	To me it sounds like BH. My guess would be that your body is just getting prepared for you to give birth. BH can start at anytime and unfortunately not go away until the birth.  I had similar pain to what you are having and all they told me was that I will continue feeling like that until I do give birth.  ALSO.....it could be that the baby is moving its way down into the birth canal and it is putting pressure on everything causing you much pain! I hope that is a little help for you. Good Luck, Congrats and I wish you a wonderful birth!|`|19893904add2e111fe179fad28e96ab6aa	these so sound like braxton hicks, you know you contract normally through out pregnancy anyway, as long as you are having good fetal movement and no vaginal drainage you should be fine, continue to relax and try to drink lots at work, sometimes when you contract it's b/c you are dehydrated, good luck with the baby!|`|98fdbd5cd1b814cad2a0336c5272ae4faa	If they go away in a warm bath, it's most likely Braxton Hicks. Last time I was pregnant, I wasn't sure if I was in labor, so I called the hospital & they said to take a warm bath, if it goes away, it's only Braxton-Hicks - only for me, it did not go away!<br>  Sounds like you are safe, but I'd still check in with a dr if you are really worried about it (better safe than sorry!)

Eventually, that will be three times the fun.<br>  <br>  For now, however, you are probably in shock. When you tell your husband, he may be shocked, too.<br>  <br>  Once you recover from the shock, take heart in knowing that all over the world, people raise children in small spaces--it's only in the US that we think every child needs their own bedroom, closet, and bathroom.<br>  <br>  Besides, your living situation could be temporary--probably is, but triplets are three times the blessing!<br>  <br>  Godspeed.<br>  <br>  PS I just read your additional details. Parents, who "hate" their daughter for marrying someone they don't like, aren't very good parents--I know it hurts to hear anyone else say that despite your own feelings about them. If they have disowned you, that's their set of issues. Please seek counseling to help you come to terms with that.<br>  <br>  Also, avoiding your husband so you won't have to tell him is a little immature, unless you fear his reaction will be violent. If you fear his reaction will be violent, please contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I am hoping that your husband is not abusive, but your fear of him AND your parents' dislike of him, have me concerned that this might be the case.|`|I64zsUQ7aa	Tell your husband, don't let him find out in some other way. If possible find another place, if you can't don't let it become stressful or could damage the children's health.|`|ff40847c18e062d6c13565e5df2c3d37aa	1) I would suggest you tell him right away because the longer you put it off, the more problematic the situation will be.<br>  <br>  2) Start putting away money. With my first pregnancy I had to work two part-time jobs and my husband had to work full-time and do side jobs so we could scrap away an additional 3,000 dollars to pad our bank account.<br>  <br>  3) You can survive, even in a one-bedroom apartment. For the first few months, you might even prefer to have the crib in the same room as your bed, because you'll constantly be getting up and it'll just be a shorter walk at night, in the end. Especially with three children - you'll need the crib in close access since one will set off the other. My husband and I raised our baby in a one-bedroom since we weren't well-to-do at the time.<br>  <br>  4) You might have a hard time breastfeeding three babies. Either contact La Leche League and find a breastfeeding support group or spokesperson near you (<a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.lalecheleague.org/)</a> that can inform you on tandem feeding (feeding multiple babies by breast) or contact WIC (Women, Infants and Children - <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/),</a> who can give you waivers and vouchers for free or very reduced cost formula if you meet their low-income requirements. It's worth a try.<br>  <br>  5) Start to look for charities, local organizations for new parents, online, and with friends and relatives who have recently had children so you can get reduced-cost, even FREE, baby clothing, baby care items, toys and things like a crib or high chair.<br>  <br>  6) Read up as much as possible about having triplets - many moms with multiple babies cannot function normally once they are past 20 weeks because multiple pregnancies include many health risks, as well as severe stress on the body. Many ob/gyns label triplets as a "high risk" pregnancy - but not to worry, you just need to take better care of yourself. Start your research at well-informed sites like <a href="http://www.pregnancyweekly.com/pregnancy_information/triplets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancyweekly.com/pregnancy...</a><br>  <br>  7) Find out which friends and relatives can take time off from work to stay with you after you give birth, since the stress might get to you, and the fact that you might not know much about taking care of children. My mother took a week off of work, and my husband's work gave him alternating days off rather than weekends, so he can take days off when I need him, rather than as planned. See if you have a wise grandmother or auntie that can stay with you a week or two, then if you mother or your husband's mother can stay with you another week or two, at least until you're up and going on your own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ol2hfaJgaa	how comes you havnt already told him already?
5QWedYT8aa	when you have a home birth you are supposed to have a nurse or a mid wife there many things could go wrong if they go wrong in the hospital they can go wrong at home and be fatal i suggest if you choose to have a home birth have a nurse or mid wife there but i would suggest go to the hospital|`|AA11972683	I don't know why you think this is a good choice.  Having a baby at home without any medical assistance is a thing of the past.  And with good reason!  It is too dangerous for you and your baby.  Is your husband medically trained?  What would you do if your baby came breech, or feet first?  What if the baby had the cord wrapped around its neck?  What if the baby is too large and you need an emergency C-section?  What if the baby is born and is not breathing?  What if you hemorrhage?  Have I made my point?  You would never forgive yourself if something happened to your baby, so don't chance it.  Please tell me you've had pre-natal care with your baby, because it sounds like you haven't!  I'm sorry to sound so harsh, but as a nurse, I see many things go wrong, and if there is nobody there to help you and something happens to your baby, depending on where you live, you could be charged.  You are not ready to be a parent if the first decision you make is to have a baby at home with absolutely no supervision.  If you just want to have a baby at home, find yourself a midwife and fast!|`|59a3a65e32c4c6ba67e77918b8d0ef11aa	The best advice I can give you is to go to the hospital.  Why are you doing this all alone?|`|WOdmgC5naa	You really should have some guidance.  Find a midwife in your area...|`|oVoEaTLbaa	Are you insane? Why on earth would you do that?

They can't turn you away. Please do not attempt to do this on your own!<br>  <br>  You could bleed to death. The baby's heart could stop during the birth. The cord could get wrapped around his neck. He/she could become trapped in your pelvis, and you may need a c-section!|`|sPxU87Hfaa	have the baby in a hospital thats my best advice............. good luck|`|OXfqeuStaa	Have you completely lost your mind??

49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	All three of my babies were born like this.  It makes for a lot of back labor and a longer one.  Sometimes the babies turn on the way out.  That did not happen with mine.  My last one needed forceps to help him out because he got stuck.  You should be safe with a home birth, just be prepared to be in alot of back pain.  Buy a little massager.  Mine was made out of wood and really helped.  I had my sister rub my back with it and the pressure made me feel a little better.  Also the hot tub or jacuzzi can help a lot.  Just relax. <br>  <br>  PS: My babies were 9-9 22 1/2 inches, 8-1 19 1/2 inches, and 9-5 20 1/2 inches.|`|217bae54c617b0aaf543f873e23468deaa	Both my kids were like that.  My first flipped on her own and my second had to be manually turned as he was being born.  it didn't really cause any serious problems, just back labour.|`|MsyujP2Kaa	You still have alot of time so baby might turn on his own. I will tell you, though, if baby doesn't turn you will have the worst back labor. My son also was in posterior position. The doc tried to turn him during labor but only got him to a sideways position and this is the position he was born in. This is probably what they will do, try and turn baby around after you are dilated. I wouldn't recommend being at home for this though.|`|bH2Yg6Ghaa	walk a lot, and they will flip|`|db20f837d3107fe2a16bcaf490b4a2b4aa	My son was posterier and was born that way.  Lots of back labor and his head was tilted also so I pushed for a long time because of that.  He was born with a cone on the right side of his head.  But the dr didn't seem too worried about turning him.  But if you are planning a home birth, it is a bit harder than if the baby was positioned properly.  But in the same aspect, if you are at home, you have more control where at the hospital they may opt for a c-section.  I was lucky to be able to naturally deliver but the nurses were mentioning c-section.  I was too determined and told them I could keep pushing.  Either way, good luck!  You still have time for the baby to turn.|`|AA11465297	there are doctors who can turn the baby but the women I have heard that tried this said that the baby turned back soon after. Swimming is something to try to as the weightless feeling in the womb may help the baby turn also. Mine was breach and I did not have it turned, opted for a C-section as was recommended by the doctors. Good luck!|`|AA11972683	I delivered my first child posterior, and he weighed 9 pounds 3 ounces!  It can be done.  You may want to reconsider a home birth and find a facility that will still allow you to have your midwife and doula in hospital, but that way if there are complications, and a c-section becomes necessary, you are already in hospital.  The pain with a posterior delivery is worse then a regular delivery because the baby's spine is pushing on your spine.  Sometimes pushing while on all fours is helpful as it takes the pressure off your back.  Your doula or midwife will help you with other positions.  Good luck!
AA11972683	Lots of rest and lots of fluid is really all you can do.  Don't worry about food intake, just the fluids.  They are most important.  If you are unable to keep down sips of fluid, or show signs of dehydration, you may need to go to the hospital for some IV rehydration.  I had this around 18 weeks, and it was terrible.  After a liter of IV fluid, and IV Gravol (Which is very safe to take during pregnancy) I felt 100% better.  Hope you feel better soon!|`|d537776618198eb71d73279c06a461bbaa	Tylenol flu will help.  I know u dont want to take meds, but sometimes its better than allowing it to continue and get even worse.  <br>  Any Tylenol product is safe during pregnancy unless otherwise advised by your doctor.  Of course call and make sure its ok, but u really need to get better as quick as possible.<br>  Good luck hun and congrats!|`|7O838ligaa	Take Tylenol now. I know it's hard to take any medication thinking that it will be bad for the baby. My wife had a flu and tried to avoid medicine, the flu became worse and she also developed harsh coughing. So I told her to take the medication or call her doctor and ask for someting before it affects the health of our baby. She called the doctor and the doctor prescribed tylenol to her, took it and she felt better after a couple of days.  <br>  <br>  Also, try to avoid honey as my wife develops Gestational Diabetes taking too much lemon juice and honey to cure her flu.<br>  <br>  Remember: Your health is important for the health of your baby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PRY8ATqdaa	Ya, when this happend to me I put a little vics vapor rub on my back and chest and bundled myself up in blankets and sweaters and I sweat it all out.  The next day I felt much better.|`|is6Mnti0aa	Steam can help with congrestion. If you dont have a vaporizer, close yourself up in the bathroom and steam it up.|`|oVoEaTLbaa	Hot tea with honey and lemon? Give yourself a massage with some scented massage oil with menthol and eucalyptus. <br>  <br>  Sorry! I hope you feel better soon! Stay hydrated.
