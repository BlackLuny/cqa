20090309131712AAygdmC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Tires and rims change?	Greetings. I've been considering an upgrade for my car. Now, it produces 150 HP, with the upgrade kit it will produce 180 HP. Keep in mind though, that this kit is provided by the manufacter. It changes the, turbo, suspension, brakes and exhaust, and contains warranty under manufacturer. Currently, I have tires that are 215/45 R17, and they're ultra high performance. Will I need to change my tires for this upgrade, or should I keep the ones that I have? Are these tires capable of handling 180 HP? Please help. Thanks.

Letâ€™s say the car is made in 2003, still very nice looking, less than $5,000. I recently found a very nice look car but when I was test driving it, it was shaky when I did a complete stop at a red light. Most cars probably shake but this car really, really shaky, almost as if it would died any minute.

20090309133005AARvrJk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Pulling to the right but car is aligned?	I hit a cement brick someone left in the middle of the highway. It destroyed my two passenger rims. I bought used rims from a guy parting out the same type car. After that incident and the new rims, my car was shaking and pulling to the left. So I had a balance done and alignment. It didn't fix anything. I took it back for them to look at again, they said they don't know why it's pulling. They switched my front left and right tires and the pull switched from going left to going right.       Since the pull switched when the tires were switched does this mean one tire is defective? Is it the tire or the rim?

My 03' Eclipse would not start when I left work today.  Instead, there was a constant ticking from the ECU relay located in the fuse area under the hood.  Pulled the relay out and stuck it back in.  The car needed a jump, but started again.  It doesn't have running lights.  However, the lights came on when the car started, but the light switch was off.  The only way I could turn off the lights was to turn the motor off.  Once the car was off,  I turned the lights on again.  They do not turn off unless I turn the key to the "on" position.  Anyone know the problem, is it just the ECU relay switch?  Thanks in advance.

20090309172115AAWkApl	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	What could be causing the squealing on my 2005 Dodge Caravan after I take it through the car wash?	I have noticed that every time I get my 2005 Dodge Caravan washed, it makes a squealing noise for a while afterwards. I always get the carwash that sprays underneath, too, because of all the slush and salt on the roads. I'm assuming it's some kind of belt maybe. The squealing is high pitched and gets louder as the van goes faster. It seems to last a day or two, I guess until the van dries out. The noise drives me crazy and must bother other drivers, too. Any ideas on what it could be? And is it a very expensive repair? Or is it something I might be able to do myself? (I'm kind of short on funds right now!) Thanks.

20090309174150AAxnYxi	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Should states raise the teenage driving age?	What makes me mad is kids driving like maniacs and getting into accidents or killing someone because they were stupid and not paying attention to what they were supposed to be doing. Kids would be driving around with a license that their parents bought them in cars that their parents also paid for and think their crap dont stink and have no idea on what real life has in store for them.       Personally, i think it should be raised, but im just looking for opinions.
