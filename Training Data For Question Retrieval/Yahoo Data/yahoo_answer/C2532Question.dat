20070216040022AAYjCRJ	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Nuova assicurazione?	Premetto che sono neopatentato (patente da < di 1 anno). Ho acquistato un'auto nuova, e stiamo valutando le offerte per l'assicurazione. Ovviamente l'auto sarà intestata a mia madre, che in famiglia è quella che pagherebbe un premio minore.   In molti moduli per i preventivi online, è presente una voce che chiede se l'auto sarà utilizzata da un conducente di età inferiore ai 26 anni, ed eventualmente i suoi dati. Il premio aumenta parecchio se dichiaro che la utilizzerò io.       La mia domanda è questa: se non lo dichiaro, non è che poi mi faranno storie, quando gli tocca sborsare i quattrini (toccando ferro ;) )? Io credo di no, probabilmente quelle domande le fanno apposta per vedere se c'è qualcuno che accetta di pagare di più.

20090205111738AAjBqJz	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	2000 S-10 valve train noise?	I have a 2000 S-10 w/ 4.3 engine, 112K. It has had a cold engine knocking noise for quite some time but always went away after a minute or so. The "knock" has been getting progressively worse and now the noise is constant, hot or cold. I suspect a lifter, bent push rod or valve spring? The noise only quiets when the engine is under load, ie, pulling level or a slight uphill at highway speed. it returns when the motor is coasting downhill slightly (no back pressure) and at idle. Oil pressure hasn't been the best for the last 30K (15-20 psi hot) but the noise sounds like it's from the top of the motor? Any ideas?
20090205111802AAztrnU	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mitsubishi	Need help with a "new" used 1998 Mitsubishi Galant?	Found a old Galant on craigslist from a couple just looking to get rid of it. They want $500 for it. It runs, paint is good, the interior is good, has 160K miles but heres the problems. Needs a new water pump, it has been sitting for almost a year being started every so often, and one of the windows don't roll down. It might be a window motor or some thing. Maybe a new set of tires and a tune-up couldn't hurt. It seems like it would be a good daily driver as my car gets what seems like 15 MPG right now and I have to use 91+ octane, how are these cars as far as reliability? I wouldn't mind being able to get 100K out of it. Should I spend the money to even bother fixing those things or pass on the car?

20090205113758AAuVUxq	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	1999 Chevy Silverado On-board Diagnosis?	Please help.  My "check engine light" went on in my 1999 Chevy Silverado.  I had the code checked at AutoZone.  It was the MAS (mass airflow sensor).  I put in a K&N air intake two years ago and the check engine light has only come on about 6 months ago.  So to remove all doubt I replaced the MAS.  I took the fuse out to reset the OBD.  But when I put the fuse back in the light came back on.  So I took it back to AutoZone.  Now there are nine new codes (P0101, P0171, P0171pd, P0174, P0174pd, P0785, P0785pd, P0740, and P1860pd).  I looked up all the codes and it seems like the ODB is bad.  I failed my car inspection and can't get it passed until I can get the codes fixed.  Please help.

20090205122904AASAf23	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Will the paint and body people quote you less if you tell them you're paying for it out of pocket?	I have a $500 deductible collision and $500 comprehensive on my RAV4 policy and was recently hit while my car was parked in front of the house.  I saw it after it had happened.  I contacted my insurance and they told me to get an estimate and let them know what I decide to do.  I went to one place that quoted me over $2400 for paint and body.  They asked me about who I have for insurance and about my deductible.  Should I tell them that?  My fear is that once they know the insurance will pick up the cost they are likely to charge more.  What is the best thing I can do in this situation, so that my insurance doesn't get overcharged for the services rendered, and I don't get my premiums increased?  Any advice is reasonable..Thanks.

When it was in the below weather I tried to start it so many times that I fried the starter ( 1 year old) I put a little starting fluid in and it blew my plastic in pieces that connects air filter and throttle body. I have not done a compression check. Sometimes when I am idling and revin it up the engine bogs out when its cold. Last winter it wasnt as bad but still a problem as soon as the weather got warm the truck was fine. The truck idles normal

20090205151050AAQ7aGt	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Wondering about my serpentine belt on 95 explorer?	My power steering went out so I opened to hood and my belt was just hanging there.  I inspected it and all the grooves looked fine.  I attempted to put it back on but it was pissing me off so I called a local mechanic.  he said that if the grooves look fine and it fell off it will probably just fall off again if he put it back on and that I probably need a new bearing for one of my pulleys.  Is this true or is he just trying to get more money?

I owe $30,000.00 on it and my truck payments are 669.00 a month. I cannot afford it. I try trading it in but the dealerships are only willing to offer me $17,500.00 for it since the economy is so bad... It does appraise at $25,000.00 though. What are my options i need to get rid of it asap.. What is the worst that can happen if i just get another car that's cheaper and let them repo my truck? I know they will auction off my truck then come after me for the remaining balance.. so could i file bankruptcy and not have to pay the balance? Would they take the new car i would get if i filed bankruptcy too? Please help.. I am only 23 and need smart advice. I don't have parents or family to help.

20090205094511AAenQCc	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Do parts brand names really matter for a Dodge Caravan (2004)?	I need a timing belt. Thinking hey while I am there may as well replace the water pump. It's a 2004 Dodge Caravan (2.4), noninterference engine.       But it's cold outside and work has been piling up so I am thinking maybe I could just have a mechanic do it and spend a little for labor.       So I call and get some prices and they are marking their prices up for way more than what I would spend for the part if I bought it myself. But they argue it's because of the brand name of the part and that it's completely superior to other parts and therefore will last longer.  I don't "buy" it.       So they wanna sell me Mopar timing belt for 94 bucks, which I get the same for 68.88 online; Or I can get the belt at Auto Zone for 31.99 (Duralast).  So what do you think?      The guy is really trying to sell me on the more expensive brand saying it's guaranteed to last for 100,000 miles. Uh - yeah okay that's generally about the time you change timing belts anyway.  Just thinking.       So tell me what you think about quality vs. cost.  I don't regularly go around changing timing belts so I don't know. Just wanted to get others' takes on this concept.

Police gave her a ticket for driving on suspended registration and said it had been suspended for 3 days. There was a lapse in coverage on insurance but it was back in June and have had proper coverage ever since and it was only a few days. Pulled my DMV records and I got my tag in July and it didnt show up as suspended but overridden. Main question I am asking is does the registration get suspended on midnight of your B-day if your tag is not bouht by then. We have to go to court on this and they said she could possibly have her license suspended for 3 months. Thanks for any insight.

I have an 05 GMC Sierra, and was planning on getting a spray-on rhino liner done, and to have it also go up over the rails. I've also been eyeing the TruXedo Lo Pro QT Soft Tonneau Cover, and would like to know if anyone has had this done and would I still get a good fit and a tight seal?
20090205124138AAEwqqW	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Am I right to turn it back in?	Three and a half weeks ago I bought a new car.First, the car lot changed the deal, raising the down payment by a couple of hundred dollars. On Monday, I finally got "final" approval from their bank on the loan, the next day, I got a call from the car lot saying that they had "messed up" and used the wrong VIN # for the contract, which means the bank and their insurance broker also have the wrong VIN#. I feel like I am being "stabbed in the back" here, should I turn the car in and report this car lot? Will it reflect badly on my credit?
